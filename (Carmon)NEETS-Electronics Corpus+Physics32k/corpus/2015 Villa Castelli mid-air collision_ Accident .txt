Each helicopter was carrying four passengers in addition to the pilot. Seconds after take-off, the two helicopters were involved in a mid-air collision at a height of about 100 metres (330 ft) above the ground. The accident occurred at about 17:15 local time (20:15 UTC). A video of the accident appears to show that the lower of the two helicopters was climbing at a rate faster than the other one, colliding with it from below.
