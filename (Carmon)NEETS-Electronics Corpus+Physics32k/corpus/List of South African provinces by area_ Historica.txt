The provincial borders have changed twice since 1994: once on 1 March 2006, when all provinces except the Free State and the Western Cape were affected; and once on 3 April 2009, when only the Gautengâ€“North West border was altered.
The pre-2006 figures are based on a less accurate calculation, and therefore the total is different from that for the post-2006 figures.
