The mathematical equation for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible (i.e., no entropy generation) adiabatic process can be represented by the polytropic process equation




P

=
constant



{\displaystyle PV^{n}=\operatorname {constant} \qquad }

where P is pressure, V is volume, and for this case n = γ where

{\displaystyle \gamma ={C_{P} \over C_{V}}={\frac {f+2}{f}},}

CP being the specific heat for constant pressure, CV being the specific heat for constant volume, γ is the adiabatic index, and f is the number of degrees of freedom (3 for monatomic gas, 5 for diatomic gas and collinear molecules e.g. carbon dioxide).
For a monatomic ideal gas, γ = 5/3, and for a diatomic gas (such as nitrogen and oxygen, the main components of air) γ = 7/5. Note that the above formula is only applicable to classical ideal gases and not Bose–Einstein or Fermi gases.
For reversible adiabatic processes, it is also true that
