Figure 1-14, view B, shows a wave winding on a drum-type armature. This type of winding is used 
in dc generators employed in high-voltage applications. Notice that the two ends of each coil are 
connected to commutator segments separated by the distance between poles. This configuration allows 
the series addition of the voltages in all the windings between brushes. This type of winding only requires 
one pair of brushes. In practice, a practical generator may have several pairs to improve commutation.
