Figure 3-16 shows a dc voltage felt at the wiper of potentiometer R1 which can be adjusted between 
+V and âˆ’V. The dc voltage, passed through the low resistance of radio frequency choke L2, acts to 
reverse bias varactor diode C3. The capacitance of C3 is in series with C2, and the equivalent capacitance 
of C2 and C3 is in parallel with tank circuit L1-C1. Therefore, any variation in the dc voltage at R1 will 
vary both the capacitance of C3 and the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. The radio-frequency choke 
provides high inductive reactance at the tank frequency to prevent tank loading by R1. C2 acts to block dc 
from the tank as well as to fix the tuning range of C3.
