Universal Motors
These motors can be supplied from either DC or AC. Their design is essentially similar to a DC motor with
series windings. When operated as AC motors, supplied say by a 60 Hz source, the current in the armature and
the ﬁeld windings reverses 120 times per second. As the torque is roughly proportional to both armature and
ﬁeld currents, connecting these windings in series guarantees that the current reverses in both at the same time,
retaining the unidirectional torque. Figure 66.23 shows a schematic diagram of the connections of universal
motors.
