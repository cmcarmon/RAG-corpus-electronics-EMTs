In the examples shown, the linkage uses two horizontal plates (red) positioned parallel to each other, one above the other. Pairs of rectangular plates (green) with hinges at the middle connect the horizontal plates. The circular arc motion of a hinge produces a linear vertical movement. The upper plate moves vertically up and down, towards and away from the lower plate.
The Sarrus linkage is of a three-dimensional class sometimes known as a space crank, unlike the Peaucellierâ€“Lipkin linkage which is a planar mechanism.
