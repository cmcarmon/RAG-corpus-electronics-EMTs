Some static circuitry is constantly resident which controls data
ﬂow and the sequencing of execution of the dynamic modules.
Swapping time can be minimized by calculating the difference
between the conﬁguration currently resident in the FPGA and
the desired new conﬁguration; a tool has been developed for
this purpose (Shirazi et al., 2000).
