A Fast VRM Topology: The Quasi-Square-Wave (QSW) VRM
To overcome the transient limitation occurring in conven-
tional VRMs, a smaller output ﬁlter inductance is the most
desirable option for increasing the energy transfer speed.
Figure 1.13 shows the quasi-square-wave (QSW) circuit.
The QSW topology keeps the VRM output inductor current
touching zero in both sleep and active modes. When Q1 turns
on,
is charged to positive by the
input voltage. After Q1 turns off and before Q2 turns on, the
inductor current ﬂows through Q2’s body diode. When Q2
turns on, the inductor current is discharged to negative.
After Q2 turns off and before Q1 turns on, the inductor
current ﬂows through Q1’s body diode. Compared with con-
