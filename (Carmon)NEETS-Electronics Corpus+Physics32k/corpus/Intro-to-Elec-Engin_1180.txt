• Correct phase sequence
• Phase voltages in phase with those of the system
• Frequency almost exactly equal to that of the system
• Machine terminal voltage approximately equal to the system voltage
A synchroscope is used for indicating the appropriate moment for synchronization. After the
machine has been synchronized and is part of the system, it can be made to take its share of the
active and reactive power by appropriate adjustments of its prime-mover throttle and ﬁeld rheostat.
The system frequency and the division of active power among the generators are controlled
by means of prime-mover throttles regulated by governors and automatic frequency regulators,
whereas the terminal voltage and the reactive volt-ampere division among the generators are
controlled by voltage regulators acting on the generator-ﬁeld circuits and by transformers with
automatic tap-changing devices.
