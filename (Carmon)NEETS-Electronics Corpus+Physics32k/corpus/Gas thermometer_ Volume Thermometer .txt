This thermometer functions by Charles's Law. Charles's Law states that when the temperature of a gas increases, so does the volume.
Using Charles's Law, the temperature can be measured by knowing the volume of gas at a certain temperature by using the formula, written below. Translating it to the correct levels of the device that is holding the gas. This works on the same principle as mercury thermometers.




V

T



{\displaystyle V\propto T\,}

or






V

=
k


{\displaystyle {\frac {V}{T}}=k}

T is the temperature.
V is the volume.
k is the constant for the system. k is not a fixed constant across all systems and therefore needs to be found experimentally for a given system through testing with known temperature values.
