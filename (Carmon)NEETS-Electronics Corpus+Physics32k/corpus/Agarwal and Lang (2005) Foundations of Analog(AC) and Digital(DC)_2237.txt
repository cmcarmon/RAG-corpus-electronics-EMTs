The diode was introduced in Chapter 4 as an example of a nonlinear device.
We used its nonlinear v i characteristic to develop several methods of analyzing
nonlinear circuits. It turns out that the diode is a particularly useful nonlinear
device, and merits closer examination. Figure 16.1 shows a few discrete diodes.
This chapter explores several useful diode circuits, and develops additional
analysis methods that are specific to diodes.
