The core diameter (D) is defined as the diameter at which the intensity is 2.5 percent of the
maximum intensity (see figure 5-9). The 2.5 percent points, or the 0.025 level, intersects the normalized
curve at radial positions - a and a. The core diameter is simply equal to 2a (D=2a).
Q17. Near-field power distributions describe the emitted power per unit area in the near-field region.
