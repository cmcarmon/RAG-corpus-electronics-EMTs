HARMONIC DISTORTION is the production of unwanted harmonic frequencies when a signal is
applied at the recorder’s input. The primary harmonic distortion in tape recorders is third order harmonics.
It’s measured with a wave analyzer. You can reduce this distortion with proper preventive maintenance
and periodic performance tests.
