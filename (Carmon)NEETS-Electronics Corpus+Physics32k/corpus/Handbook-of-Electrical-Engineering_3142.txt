The controlled full-wave dc output may be obtained by using either a center tap transformer (Fig. 30.10) or
by bridge conﬁguration (Fig. 30.11). The bridge conﬁguration is often used when a transformer is undesirable
and  the  magnitude  of  the  supply  voltage  properly  meets  the  load  voltage  requirements.  The  average  output
voltage of a single-phase full-wave converter for continuous current conduction is given by
