where E is the electric ﬁeld, H the magnetic ﬁeld,  dielectric permittivity, µ magnetic permeability, σ
electrical conductivity, and ρ is the charge density. Kirchhoﬀ’s Laws represent special cases of these equations
for circuits. We are not going to solve Maxwell’s equations here; do bear in mind that a fundamental
understanding of communications channels ultimately depends on ﬂuency with Maxwell’s equations. Perhaps
the most important aspect of them is that they are linear with respect to the electrical and magnetic ﬁelds.
Thus, the ﬁelds (and therefore the voltages and currents) resulting from two or more sources will add.
note: Nonlinear electromagnetic media do exist. The equations as written here are simpler
versions that apply to free-space propagation and conduction in metals. Nonlinear media are be-
coming increasingly important in optic ﬁber communications, which are also governed by Maxwell’s
equations.
