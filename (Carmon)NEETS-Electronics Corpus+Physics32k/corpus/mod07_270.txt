The ZENER EFFECT was first proposed by Dr. Carl Zener in 1934. According to Dr. Zener's 
theory, electrical breakdown in solid dielectrics occurs by a process called QUANTUM-MECHANICAL 
TUNNELING. The Zener effect accounts for the breakdown below 5 volts; whereas, above 5 volts the 
breakdown is caused by the avalanche effect. Although the avalanche effect is now accepted as an 
explanation of diode breakdown, the term Zener diode is used to cover both types.
