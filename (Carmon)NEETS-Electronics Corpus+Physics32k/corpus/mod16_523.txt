current bridges. These bridges are composed of capacitors, inductors, and resistors in a wide variety of
combinations. These bridges operate on the principle of the Wheatstone bridge; that is, an unknown
resistance is balanced against known resistances and, after the bridge has been balanced, the unknown
resistance is calculated in terms of the known resistance.
