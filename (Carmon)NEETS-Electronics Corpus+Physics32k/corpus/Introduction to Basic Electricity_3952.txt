operational amplifiers are usually called op-amps. 
An op-amp is a very high gain amplifier used to 
amplify both AC and DC signals. Typically, op-amps 
have an output gain in the range of 20,000 to 1,000,000 
times the input. Figure 38-21 shows the schematic 
symbol used for op-amps. The negative (2) input is 
called the inverting input and the positive (1) is 
called the noninverting input.
