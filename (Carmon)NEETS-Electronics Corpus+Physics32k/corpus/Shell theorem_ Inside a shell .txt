For a point inside the shell, the difference is that when θ is equal to zero, ϕ takes the value π radians and s the value R - r. When θ increases from 0 to π radians, ϕ decreases from the initial value π radians to zero and s increases from the initial value R - r to the value R + r.
This can all be seen in the following figure

Inserting these bounds into the primitive function

one gets that, in this case

{\displaystyle F_{r}=0}

saying that the net gravitational forces acting on the point mass from the mass elements of the shell, outside the measurement point, cancel out.
Generalization: If
