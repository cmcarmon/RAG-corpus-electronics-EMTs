15.8 P O S I T I V E F E E D B A C K
In every Op Amp circuit discussed thus far, the feedback network has been con-
nected from the Op Amp output to the negative input terminal of the Op Amp.
Such a connection provides negative feedback, which tends to make the circuit
more linear, more temperature independent, more reliable. An obvious ques-
tion: What happens if the feedback is connected to the positive input terminal,
as in Figure 15.30a?
