The CardTerminal layer plays the role of the driver and the reader manufacturer should provide it. It offers
an interface that enables the seamless integration of the reader in the OCF environment. With OCF-compliant
interfaces, a speciÔ¨Åc card terminal gives access to the reader and the smart card. A CardTerminal can also act
as  a  bridge  to  provide  a  transparent  access  to  a  reader  through  the  PCSC  interface  to  take  advantage  of  the
existing components.
