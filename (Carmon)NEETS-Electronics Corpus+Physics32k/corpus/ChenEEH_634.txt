0!1 probabilities of bit assertions in LNS words, how-
ever, are not constant as p0!1(i) of equation 1.35; they depend
on the signiÔ¨Åcance of the ith bit. To evaluate the probabilities
pLNS
0!1(i), the following experiment is performed. For all pos-
sible values of X in a n-bit system, the corresponding blogb Xc
