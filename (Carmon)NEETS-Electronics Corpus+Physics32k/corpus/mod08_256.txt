Figure 2-17 shows the effect of the base-to-collector interelectrode capacitance in an rf amplifier.
The "phantom" capacitor (CBC) represents the interelectrode capacitance between the base and the
collector of Q1. This is the interelectrode capacitance that has the most effect in an rf amplifier. As you
can see, CBC causes a degenerative (negative) feedback which decreases the gain of the amplifier. (There
are some special cases in which CBC can cause regenerative (positive) feedback. In this case, the
technique described below will provide negative feedback which will accomplish the neutralization of the
amplifier.)
