Before leaving this section, you should be aware of one precaution associated with mercury-vapor
tubes. The mercury vapor is not placed in the tube as a vapor; instead a small amount of liquid mercury is
placed in the tube before it is sealed. When the liquid mercury comes in contact with the hot filament, the
mercury vaporizes.
