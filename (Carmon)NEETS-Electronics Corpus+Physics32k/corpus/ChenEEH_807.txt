Simultaneous statements can be either simple or compound.
The latter form may consist of a procedural, a case, or an if
statement. The simple statement as deﬁned above unveils two
interesting properties. First, it is a noncausal formulation of an
equation. This means that the ¼¼ symbol denotes equality in
the mathematical sense and not an assignment such as the <¼
symbol in digital data ﬂow descriptions. As a consequence, the
modeler does not need to formulate explicit equations. The
more general implicit differential algebraic equation (DAE)
form may be used directly instead. Second, the other interest-
ing property is related to the optional tolerance aspect of the
statement. This is intended to specify the numerical accuracy
of the equality, which is a very general way to deal with
numerical problems. Usually, a modeler is interested only in
accuracy aspects but not in selecting solution methods for
(e.g., numerical) integration. The implementors of a VHDL–
AMS simulation engine can provide the appropriate algo-
rithms, whereas a modeler can specify accuracy levels only by
means of tolerance aspects.
