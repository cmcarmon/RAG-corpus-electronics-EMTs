Once  the  video  signal  has  been  sampled  and  quantized,  it  can  be  processed  digitally.  Processing  can  be
performed  on  special-purpose  hardware  or  general-purpose  computers.  The  type  of  processing  performed
depends on the particular application. For example, if the objective is to generate high-deÔ¨Ånition television,
the processing would typically include compression and motion estimation. In fact, in most of the applications
listed above these are the fundamental operations. Compression is the process of compactly representing the
information  contained  in  an  image  or  video  signal.  Motion estimation is  the  process  of  estimating  the  dis-
placement  of  the  moving  objects  in  a  video  sequence.  The  displacement  information  can  then  be  used  to
interpolate missing frame data or to improve the performance of compression algorithms.
