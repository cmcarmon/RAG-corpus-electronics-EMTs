Thyristors 
 
Thyristors  (or  silicon  controlled  rectifiers) are 
three-terminal  devices  which  can  be  used  for 
switching  and  a.c.  power  control.  Thyristors  can 
switch  very  rapidly  from  a  conducting  to  a  non-
conducting  state.  In  the  off  state,  the  thyristor 
exhibits negligible leakage current, while in the on 
state  the  device  exhibits  very  low  resistance.  This 
results in very little power loss within the thyristor 
even  when  appreciable  power  levels  are  being 
controlled. Once switched into the conducting state, 
the  thyristor  will  remain  conducting  (i.e.  it  is 
latched in the on state) until the forward current is 
removed  from  the  device.  In  d.c.  applications  this 
necessitates  the  interruption  (or  disconnection)  of 
the  supply  before  the  device  can  be  reset  into  its 
non-conducting  state.  Where  the  device  is  used 
with  an  alternating  supply, 
the  device  will 
automatically  become  reset  whenever  the  main 
supply  reverses.  The  device  can  then  be  triggered 
on  the  next  half-cycle  having  correct  polarity  to 
permit  conduction.  Like  their  conventional  silicon 
diode  counterparts,  thyristors  have  anode  and 
cathode connections; control is applied by means of 
a gate  terminal  (see  Fig.  5.13).  The  device  is 
triggered into the conducting (on state) by means of 
the  application  of  a  current  pulse  to  this  terminal. 
The  effective  triggering  of  a  thyristor  requires  a 
gate  trigger  pulse  having a  fast rise time derived 
from  a 
low-resistance  source.  Triggering  can
