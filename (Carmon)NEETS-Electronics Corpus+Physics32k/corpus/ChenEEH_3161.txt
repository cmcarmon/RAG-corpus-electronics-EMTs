The mechanical performance of outdoor insulators is deter-
mined by all the main components of the insulator, namely,
dielectric and end-ﬁttings, as well as the details of internal
attachment of the dielectric with the end-ﬁttings. Failure of
the insulator to perform mechanically results in dropping of
the conductors. This type of insulator failure is not acceptable
as it leads to a prolonged interruption of power, possible
personnel injury and equipment damage.
