vGS, we approximated the behavior as a linear resistor using the SR model.
Clearly, the SR model does not capture MOSFET behavior if we vary vGS.
Worse yet, even for a given value of vGS, the SR model becomes inaccurate as
the value of vDS approaches vGS âˆ’ VT. For more accuracy, we can develop a
more elaborate model for the triode region operation of the MOSFET. Aban-
doning the piecewise-linear method, this more elaborate model characterizes
the behavior of the MOSFET in the triode region as a nonlinear resistor, whose
characteristics depend on vGS. When combined with the SCS model for the
saturation region, the nonlinear resistor model in the triode region results in
a continuous set of MOSFET curves. The resulting combined model for the
triode and saturation regions is called the switch unified model or the SU model
of the MOSFET.
