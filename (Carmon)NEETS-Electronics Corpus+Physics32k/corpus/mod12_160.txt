In the process just described, the 100 kilohertz frequency is referred to as the CARRIER 
FREQUENCY, and the sum and difference frequencies are referred to as SIDE FREQUENCIES. Since 
the sum frequency appears above the carrier frequency, it is referred to as the UPPER SIDE 
FREQUENCY. The difference frequency appears below the carrier and is referred to as the LOWER 
SIDE FREQUENCY.
