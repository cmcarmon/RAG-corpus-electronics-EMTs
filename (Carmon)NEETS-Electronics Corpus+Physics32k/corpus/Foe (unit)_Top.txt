A foe is a unit of energy equal to 1044 joules or 1051 ergs, used to express the large amount of energy released by a supernova. The word is an acronym derived from a part of the pronunciation, in English, of 1051 ergs. In English it is pronounced, "ten to the power of fifty-one ergs."
It was coined by Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University in his work with Hans Bethe, because "it came up often enough in our work". A bethe (B) is equivalent to a foe. The bethe is named after Hans Bethe. It was coined by Stephen Weinberg.
This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period (which can be measured in seconds). In comparison, if the Sun had its current luminosity throughout its entire lifetime, it would release 3.827×1026 W × 3.1536×107 s/yr × 1010 yr ≈ 1.2 foe. One solar mass has a rest mass energy of 1787 foe.
