In Portuguese, the conditional is formed by the imperfect form of habēre affixed to the main verb's infinitive. However, in spoken language, the periphrastic form is also extremely common.
Portuguese conditional is also called past future futuro do pretérito, as it describes both conjectures that would occur given a certain condition and actions that were to take place in the future, from a past perspective. When the conditional has the former purpose, it imperatively comes along with a conditional subordinate clause in the past subjunctive.
The Conditional is also one of the two Portuguese tenses which demand mesoclisis when proclisis is forbidden – since enclisis is always considered ungrammatical.
Não o falaríamos/ Não to falaríamos (we would not say it/ we would not say it to you) Grammatical use of proclisis
Falá-lo-íamos/ Falar-to-íamos (we would say it/ we would say it to you) Grammatical use of mesoclisis.
O falaríamos/ To falaríamos (we would say it/ we would say it to you) Ungrammatical use of proclisis.
Falaríamo-lo/ Falaríamo-to (we would say it/ we would say it to you) Ungrammatical use of enclisis.
