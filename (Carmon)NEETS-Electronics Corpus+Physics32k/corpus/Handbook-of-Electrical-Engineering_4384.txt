Finally, the engineer using optical ﬁbers has a great deal of ﬂexibility. He or she can install an optical ﬁber
cable and use it initially in a low-capacity (low-bit-rate) system. As the system needs grow, the engineer can
take  advantage  of  the  broadband  capabilities  of  optical  ﬁbers  and  convert  to  a  high-capacity  (high-bit-rate)
system by simply changing the terminal electronics.
