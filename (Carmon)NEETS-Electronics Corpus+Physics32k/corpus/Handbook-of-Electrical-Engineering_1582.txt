Historical Perspective
Modern  spectral  analysis  dates  back  at  least  to  Sir  Isaac  Newton  [Newton,  1671],  whose  prism  experiments
with  sunlight  led  him  to  discover  that  each  color  represented  a  particular  wavelength  of  light  and  that  the
  to
sunlight  contained  all  wavelengths.  Newton  used  the  word 
describe the band of visible light colors.
