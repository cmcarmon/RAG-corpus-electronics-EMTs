Upon receipt of a character code and a row and column address, the device logic reads the picture 
element pattern (dot matrix) from the ROM and writes the pattern into the appropriate character position 
in the page memory. The desired character is then displayed at the correct position. Other display devices 
store the codes in page memory and convert the codes to picture element dots when scanning memory to 
refresh or redisplay the characters on the screen. The use of formatted displays greatly simplifies the 
programming requirements for the display of alphanumeric data.
