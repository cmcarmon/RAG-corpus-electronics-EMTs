By modiﬁcation of the repetition and orientation of excitation pulses, an image can be made T1, T2, or proton
density dominated. A proton density image shows static blood and fat as white and bone as black, while a T1
weighted image shows fat as white, blood as gray, and cerebrospinal ﬂuid as black. T2 weighted images tend to
highlight pathology since pathologic tissue tends to have longer T2 than normal.
