lated noise due to the numerical
instability originates at
i ¼ 90. Again, in accordance with equation 9.90, the noise
(i.e.
oscillates with a spatial period of
~ll ¼ 2Dx). However, the rate of exponential growth here is
much less than that predicted by equation 9.91, wherein all
grid points were assumed to violate Courant stability. Upon
analyzing the raw data underlying Figure 9.11(B), a growth
factor of q ﬃ 1:31 is observed per time-step. This compares to
q ﬃ 3:55 per time-step determined by substituting S ¼ 1:2075
into equation 9.91. Thus, it is clear that a grid having one or
