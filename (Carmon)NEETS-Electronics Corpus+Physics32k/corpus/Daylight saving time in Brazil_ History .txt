Before 2008, there were no fixed start and end dates for summer time, nor which states should or should not follow it; they were decided every year by one or more decrees, sometimes published very close to their start date.
On 8 September 2008, Presidential Decree n. 6.558 established fixed start and end dates and listed the Brazilian federative units that will annually observe daylight saving time. Later, Presidential Decree n. 7.584, of 13 October 2011, added the state of Bahia to the list of DST observing territories. In 2012, the observing states were changed again: Bahia was excluded from daylight saving time, and Tocantins was included. Tocantins stopped observing daylight saving time in 2013.
