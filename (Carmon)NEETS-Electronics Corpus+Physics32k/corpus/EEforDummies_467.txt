Magnetism and electricity were once thought to be two separate phenomena, 
until a 19th‐century scientist named Hans Christian Ørsted discovered that 
a compass needle moved away from magnetic north when current supplied 
by a nearby battery was switched on and off. Ørsted’s keen observation led 
to lots of research and experimentation, ultimately confirming the fact that 
electricity and magnetism are closely related. After several years (and many 
more accidental discoveries), Michael Faraday and other 19th‐century scien-
tists figured out how to capitalize on the phenomenon known as electromag-
netism to create the world’s first electromechanical devices. Today’s power 
transformers, electromagnetic generators, and many industrial motors are 
based on the principles of electromagnetism.
