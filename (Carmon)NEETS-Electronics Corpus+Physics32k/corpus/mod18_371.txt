The IF AMPLIFIER SECTION of a radar receiver determines the gain, signal-to-noise ratio, and
effective bandwidth of the receiver. The typical IF amplifier (commonly called an IF strip) usually
contains from three to ten amplifier stages. The IF amplifier has the capability to vary both the bandpass
and the gain of a receiver. Normally, the bandpass is as narrow as possible without affecting the actual
signal energy. When a selection of pulse widths is available, such as short and long pulses, the bandpass
must be able to match the bandwidth of the two different signals. Gain must be variable to provide a
constant voltage output for input signals of different amplitudes. Figure 2-27 is a block diagram of an IF
amplifier that meets these requirements.
