. Impulse noise: Irregular pulses and short duration
of relative high amplitude cause impulse noise. This
noise is also caused by lightning and faults in the
communication system. It is not an annoyance for
analog data, but it is an annoyance for digital data.
For example, 0.01 sec at 4800 bps causes 50 bits of
distortion.
