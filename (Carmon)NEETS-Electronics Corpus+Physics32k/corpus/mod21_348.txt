Iron-core wattmeters are primarily used as switchboard instruments and employ the induction 
principle. Voltage and current coils are wound around a laminated iron core shaped to produce a mutually 
perpendicular magnetic field across an air gap. Eddy currents induced in a thin metal cylinder rotating in 
this air gap interact with the magnetic field to produce a torque proportional to the instantaneous power. 
This type of construction provides the advantages of increased operating torque, larger angles of rotation, 
ruggedness, compactness, and freedom from errors caused by stray fields. It has the disadvantage of a 
very narrow frequency range.
