Note that the order of the summations in equations 4.25
through 4.27 has been intentionally modiﬁed from the order
of cycle traversal to highlight an important characteristic.
Speciﬁcally, observe that equation 4.25 is the sum of equations
4.26 and 4.27 that is, there exists a linear dependence not only
among the skews in the circuit C but also among the cycles (or
sets of linearly dependent skews).
