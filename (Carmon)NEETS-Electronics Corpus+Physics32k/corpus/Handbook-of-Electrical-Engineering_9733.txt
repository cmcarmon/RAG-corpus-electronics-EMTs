3. FTP—This allows you to transfer ﬁles from one computer to another or from one remote site to another
remote site. The user has the ability to download ﬁles from shareware servers or from private ﬁles using
a password for entry. FTP can download small ﬁles and huge databases. It is the primary method for
those doing research or fact ﬁnding to acquire massive amounts of information in a very short time. As
was  mentioned  previously,  the  time  it  takes  to  download  ﬁles  is  directly  related  to  the  speed  of  your
modem, or direct connection. This can take a very long time in the case of large ﬁles.
