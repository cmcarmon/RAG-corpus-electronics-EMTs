pulse  has  been  completed,  the  probe  tip  adopts  a 
tri-state  (high  impedance)  condition.  Hence  the 
probe does not permanently affect the logical state 
of the point in question. 
  Logic pulsers derive their power supply from the 
circuit  under  test  in  the  same  manner  as  logic 
probes.  Here  again, 
the  supply  and  ground 
connections  usually  make  suitable  connecting 
points. 
  A  typical  logic  pulser  circuit  is  shown  in  
Fig. 15.20. The circuit comprises a 555 monostable 
pulse  generator  triggered  from  a  push-button.  The 
output  of 
to  a 
complementary  transistor  arrangement  in  order  to 
make  it  fully  TTL-compatible.    As  with  the  logic 
pulser, this circuit derives its power from the circuit 
under test (usually +5V). 
  Figure 15.21 shows an example of the combined 
use of a logic probe and a logic pulser for testing a 
simple  J-K  bistable.  The  logic  probe  is  used  to 
check  the  initial  state  of  the  bistable  outputs  (see 
Fig. 15.21(a) and (b)). Note that the outputs should 
be complementary. Next, the logic pulser is applied 
to  the  clock  (CK)  input  of  the  bistable  (Fig. 
15.21(c))  and  the  Q  output  is  checked  using  the 
logic  probe.  The  application  of  a  pulse  (using  the 
trigger  button)  should  cause  the  Q  output  of  the 
bistable to change state (see Fig. 15.21(d)).
