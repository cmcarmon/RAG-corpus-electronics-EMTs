When a voltage is speciﬁed with a double subscript (the characters ”2-1” in the notation
”E2−1”), it means the voltage at the ﬁrst point (2) as measured in reference to the second point
(1). A voltage speciﬁed as ”Ecd” would mean the voltage as indicated by a digital meter with
the red test lead on point ”c” and the black test lead on point ”d”: the voltage at ”c” in reference
to ”d”.
