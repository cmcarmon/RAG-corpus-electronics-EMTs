Figure 15.13 shows an example of the cepstrum for the voiced /i/ utterance from Fig. 15.7. The cepstrum of
such a voiced utterance is characterized by relatively large values in the ﬁrst one or two milliseconds as well as
by pulses of decaying amplitudes at multiples of the pitch period. The ﬁrst two of these pulses can clearly be
seen in Fig. 15.13 at time lags of 7.1 and 14.2 ms. The location and amplitudes of these pulses may be used to
estimate pitch and voicing [Rabiner and Schafer, 1978].
