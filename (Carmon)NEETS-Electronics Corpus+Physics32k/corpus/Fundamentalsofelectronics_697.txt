This signal (Figure 5.29) serves as the input to a ﬁrst-order RC lowpass ﬁlter. We want to design the ﬁlter
and the parameters ∆ and T so that the output voltage at time 4T (for a 4-bit converter) is proportional
to the number. This combination of pulse creation and ﬁltering constitutes our simple D/A converter. The
requirements are
