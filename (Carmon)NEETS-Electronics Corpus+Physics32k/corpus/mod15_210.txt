4. Momentarily short S1 to S3 as shown. If the synchro tester dial moves when S1 is shorted to S3, 
the synchro is not zeroed. Check the tester dial to ensure it has not slipped. If the tester dial has 
not slipped, move the synchro stator until there is no movement when S1 and S3 are shorted. This 
is the electrical zero position of the synchro being aligned.
