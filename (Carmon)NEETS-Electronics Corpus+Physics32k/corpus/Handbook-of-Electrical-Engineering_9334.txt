With object-oriented systems, library programs may have user-written delegates whose methods are used by
the library object. For example, a window—a library object—may send the message “windowWillClose” (written
by the user) to its delegate in response to the operators clicking of the window’s close button. In response, the
delegate may now interrogate the window in order to determine whether its contents have been changed and
possibly require saving (mutual referencing).
