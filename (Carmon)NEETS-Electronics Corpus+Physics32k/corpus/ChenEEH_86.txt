Graphs permit easy pictorial representations. In a pictorial
representation, each vertex is represented by a dot, and each
edge is represented by a line joining the dots associated with
the edge. In directed graphs, an orientation or direction is
assigned to each edge. If the edge is associated with the ordered
pair (vi, vj), then this edge is oriented from vi to vj. If an edge e
connects vertices vi and vj, then it is denoted by e Â¼ (vi, vj). In
a directed graph, (vi, vj) refers to an edge directed from
vi to vj. An undirected graph and a directed graph are shown
in Figure 2.1. Unless explicitly stated, the term graph may refer
to a directed graph or an undirected graph.
