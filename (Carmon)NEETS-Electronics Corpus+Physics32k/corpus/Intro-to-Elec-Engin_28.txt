Part 2: Electronic Analog and Digital Systems With the background of Part I, the student
is then directed to analog and digital building blocks. Operational ampliﬁers are discussed as an
especially important special case. After introducing digital system components, computer systems,
and networks to the students, semiconductor devices, integrated circuits, transistor ampliﬁers, as
well as digital circuits are presented. The discussion of device physics is kept to the necessary
minimum, while emphasis is placed on obtaining powerful results from simple tools placed in
students’ hands and minds.
