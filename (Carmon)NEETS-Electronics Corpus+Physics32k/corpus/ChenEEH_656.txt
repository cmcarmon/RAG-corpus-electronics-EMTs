Because of the eternal push for more complex applications
with correspondingly larger and more complicated data
types, storage technology is taking center stage in more and
more applications (Lawton, 1999), especially in the informa-
tion technology area, including multimedia processing, net-
work protocols, and telecom terminals. In addition, the access
speed, size, and power consumption associated with the avail-
able storage devices form a severe bottleneck in these systems,
especially in an embedded context. In this chapter, several
building blocks for memory storage will be investigated ﬁrst,
with the emphasis on their internal architectural organization.
Section 2 presents a general classiﬁcation of the main memory
components for customized organizations, including register
