A few common examples of the pattern. The situation describes always the starting point to which a fix is applied. This bears then the consequences which are confronted again with a new fix.
Maximizing ROR
Situation: A manufacturing company becomes successful with high-performance parts, and its CEO wants to maximize the ROR.
Fix: Refusal of investment in expensive, new production machines.
Consequences: The product quality drops and therefore the sales of it.
Cutting back maintenance
Situation: The company needs to save money.
Fix: Decrease the amount of maintenance.
Consequences: More breakdowns of the equipment, higher costs and cost-cutting pressure.
Quest for water
Situation: Farmers are confronted with water shortage.
Fix: Drilling new wells or making the old ones deeper.
Consequences: The water table drops.
Cash shortage
Situation: A person can't pay interest (for example on a credit card).
Fix: Take up a new loan to pay the interest (a new credit card).
Consequences: There is more interest to pay next time.
Tax revenue shortage
Situation: A government is not satisfied with its tax revenues.
Fix: Increase the cigarette tax to raise more taxes.
Consequences: Smuggling of cigarettes develops and reduces the number of taxed cigarettes sold in the country.
