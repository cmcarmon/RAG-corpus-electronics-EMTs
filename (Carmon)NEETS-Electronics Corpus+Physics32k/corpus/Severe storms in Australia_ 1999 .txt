Australia's most costly natural disaster in dollar terms was a severe hail storm over Sydney on 14 April 1999. Hail up to almost the size of cricket balls – 8 to 9 inches (200 to 230 mm) circumference – fell in a damage path that extended from Bundeena in the south to Darling Point in the North, and from Sydenham in the inner-west to Bondi Junction in the east. In total, over 20,000 properties and 40,000 vehicles were damaged during the storm with more than 25 aircraft damaged at Sydney Airport.
