RThevenin = RNorton
Considering the fact that both Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are intended to
behave the same as the original network in supplying voltage and current to the load resistor
(as seen from the perspective of the load connection points), these two equivalent circuits,
having been derived from the same original network should behave identically.
