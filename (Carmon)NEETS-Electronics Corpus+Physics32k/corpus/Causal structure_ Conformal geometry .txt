Two metrics




g


{\displaystyle \,g}
and






g
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}}
are conformally related if






g
^



=

Ω

2


g


{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}=\Omega ^{2}g}
for some real function



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
called the conformal factor. (See conformal map).
Looking at the definitions of which tangent vectors are timelike, null and spacelike we see they remain unchanged if we use




g


{\displaystyle \,g}
or






g
^



.


{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}.}
As an example suppose



X


{\displaystyle X}
is a timelike tangent vector with respect to the




g


{\displaystyle \,g}
metric. This means that




g
(
X
,
X
)
<
0


{\displaystyle \,g(X,X)<0}
. We then have that






g
^



(
X
,
X
)
=

Ω

2


g
(
X
,
X
)
<
0


{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}(X,X)=\Omega ^{2}g(X,X)<0}
so



X


{\displaystyle X}
is a timelike tangent vector with respect to the






g
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {g}}}
too.
It follows from this that the causal structure of a Lorentzian manifold is unaffected by a conformal transformation.
