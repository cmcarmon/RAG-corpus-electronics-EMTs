Zero speed switches differ in terms of performance specifications, mounting styles, and features. Important specifications include operating range or the input shaft speed, trip set-point, operating temperature range, operating conditions, field adjustability, operating voltage, and relay contact rating. For various applications, zero speed switch suppliers can provide zero speed switches that are explosion proof, weather proof or dust proof.
There are two types of ZSS, based on power supply provision. One is the interrupted power type, in which the power supply is given to the ZSS only for the duration for which the power is going to the motor of that machine. In the second type, the power supply is continuously given to the ZSS. Installation of the zero speed switches depends on the shaft or rotating part construction, where the speed has to be monitored.
