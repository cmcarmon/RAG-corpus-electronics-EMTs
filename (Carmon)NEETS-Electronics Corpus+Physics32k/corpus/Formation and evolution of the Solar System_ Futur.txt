Astronomers estimate that the Solar System as we know it today will not change drastically until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.
