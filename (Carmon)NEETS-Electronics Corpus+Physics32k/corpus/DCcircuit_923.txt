The strain gauge’s resistance (Rgauge) is not the only resistance being measured: the wire
resistances Rwire1 and Rwire2, being in series with Rgauge, also contribute to the resistance of
the lower half of the rheostat arm of the bridge, and consequently contribute to the voltmeter’s
indication. This, of course, will be falsely interpreted by the meter as physical strain on the
gauge.
