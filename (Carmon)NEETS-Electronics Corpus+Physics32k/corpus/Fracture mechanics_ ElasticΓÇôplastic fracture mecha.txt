Most engineering materials show some nonlinear elastic and inelastic behavior under operating conditions that involve large loads. In such materials the assumptions of linear elastic fracture mechanics may not hold, that is,
the plastic zone at a crack tip may have a size of the same order of magnitude as the crack size
the size and shape of the plastic zone may change as the applied load is increased and also as the crack length increases.
Therefore, a more general theory of crack growth is needed for elastic-plastic materials that can account for:
the local conditions for initial crack growth which include the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids (decohesion) at a crack tip.
a global energy balance criterion for further crack growth and unstable fracture.
