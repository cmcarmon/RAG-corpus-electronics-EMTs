Field Strength and Propagation
The ﬁeld strength produced by an FM broadcast station depends on the ERP, antenna heights, local terrain,
tropospheric scattering conditions, and other factors. From a statistical point of view, however, an estimate of
the  ﬁeld  intensity  may  be  obtained  from  Fig. 69.13.  A  factor  in  the  determination  of  new  licenses  for  FM
broadcast  is  the  separation  between  allocated  co-channel  and  adjacent  channel  stations,  the  class  of  station,
and the antenna heights. The spacings are given in Table 69.6. The primary coverage of all classes of stations
(except B and B1, which are 0.5 mV/m and 0.7 mV/m, respectively) is the 1.0 mV/m contour. The distance to
the primary contour, as well as to the “city grade” or 3.16 mV/m contour may be estimated using Fig. 69.13.
Although FM broadcast propagation is generally thought of as line-of-sight, larger ERPs along with the effects
of diffraction, refraction, and tropospheric scatter allow coverage slightly greater than line-of-sight.
