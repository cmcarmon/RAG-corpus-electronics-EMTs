The maximum range ability of surface-search radar is primarily limited by the radar horizon;
therefore, higher frequencies are used to permit maximum reflection from small, reflecting areas, such as
ship masthead structures and the periscopes of submarines. Narrow pulse widths are used to permit a high
degree of range resolution at short ranges and to achieve greater range accuracy. High pulse-repetition
rates are used to permit a maximum definition of detected objects. Medium peak power can be used to
permit the detection of small objects at line-of-sight distances. Wide vertical-beam widths permit
compensation for the pitch and roll of own ship and detection of low flying aircraft. Narrow horizontal-
beam widths permit accurate bearing determination and good bearing resolution. For example, a common
shipboard surface-search radar has the following design specifications:
