In quantum mechanics, a spin-exchange interaction preserves total angular momentum of the system but may allow other aspects of the system to change. When two spin-polarized atoms in their ground state experience a spin-exchange collision, the total spin of the atoms is preserved yet the orientation of the individual spins may change. For example, if atoms



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
are oppositely polarized, a spin-exchange collision reverses the spins:




A

B
(

→

(

B
(

{\displaystyle A(\uparrow )+B(\downarrow )\rightarrow A(\downarrow )+B(\uparrow )}
