A quick return mechanism is an apparatus that converts circular motion (rotating motion following a circular path) into reciprocating motion (repetitive back-and-forth linear motion) in presses and shaping machines, which are utilized to shape stocks of metal into flat surfaces, throughout mechanical engineering. The quick return mechanism is the foundation behind the energy of these machines.
The mechanism consists of an arm attached to a rotating disc that moves at a controlled uniform speed. Unlike the crank, the arm of the mechanism runs at a different rate than the disc. By having the disc run at a different rate than the attached arm, productivity increases because the amount of time needed for a cut is reduced. The design of this mechanism specializes in vector calculus and the physical aspects of kinematics (study of motion without the effects of forces) and dynamics (study of forces that affect motion).
