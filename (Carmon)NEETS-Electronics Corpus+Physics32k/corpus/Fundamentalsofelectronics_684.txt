We note that the noise has been dramatically reduced, with a sinusoid now clearly visible in the
ﬁltered output. Some residual noise remains because noise components within the ﬁlter’s passband
appear in the output as well as the signal.
Exercise 5.33
(Solution on p. 193.)
Note that when compared to the input signal’s sinusoidal component, the output’s sinusoidal com-
ponent seems to be delayed. What is the source of this delay? Can it be removed?
