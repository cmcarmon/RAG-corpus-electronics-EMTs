The acceleration of one point C relative to another point B is simply the difference between their accelerations.






A


C

/

B


=


A


C


−


A


B




{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{C/B}=\mathbf {A} _{C}-\mathbf {A} _{B}}

which is the difference between the components of their accelerations.
If point C has acceleration components





A


C


=

(


A


C

x




,

A


C

y




,

A


C

z





)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{C}=\left(A_{C_{x}},A_{C_{y}},A_{C_{z}}\right)}

and point B has acceleration components





A


B


=

(


A


B

x




,

A


B

y




,

A


B

z





)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{B}=\left(A_{B_{x}},A_{B_{y}},A_{B_{z}}\right)}

then the acceleration of point C relative to point B is the difference between their components:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{C/B}=\mathbf {A} _{C}-\mathbf {A} _{B}=\left(A_{C_{x}}-A_{B_{x}},A_{C_{y}}-A_{B_{y}},A_{C_{z}}-A_{B_{z}}\right)}

Alternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the second time derivative of the relative position vector PB/A.
