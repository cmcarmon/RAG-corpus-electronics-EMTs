At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, g = 9.80665 m/s2), a kilogram mass exerts a force of about 9.8 newtons. An average-sized apple exerts about one newton of force, which we measure as the apple's weight.
1 N = 0.102 kg × 9.80665 m/s2    (0.102 kg = 102 g)
The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about 550 – 800 N.
566 N = 57.7 kg × 9.80665 m/s2 (where 57.7 kg is the average Asian adult mass)
791 N = 80.7 kg × 9.80665 m/s2 (where 80.7 kg is average North American adult mass)
