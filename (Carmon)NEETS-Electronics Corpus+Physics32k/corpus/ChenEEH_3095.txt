The forward waves of all three phases are the same, while the
backward waves are 1208 out of phase. By adding the MMFs of
the three phases, a resultant wave is obtained in which the
fundamental space component travels in the forward direction
and has a magnitude 3/2 times the peak MMF of one phase
alone. The backward waves cancel. This is the most common
method of producing traveling magnetic ﬁelds in motors.
Figure 4.5 shows a simpliﬁed 18-slot machine with three-
phase sinusoidal currents. Each phase is placed into three
consecutive slots with the return nine slots away. The MMF
at different instants of time is plotted, and the wave moves to
the right at a rate of one wavelength (two poles) per cycle. The
wave is distorted due to the space harmonics included. These
have little inﬂuence on the energy conversion process and are
not dealt with here.
