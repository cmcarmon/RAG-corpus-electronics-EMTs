There is a Fourier transform relationship between the antenna illumination function and the far-Ô¨Åeld antenna
pattern.  Hence,  tapering  the  illumination  to  concentrate  power  near  the  center  of  the  antenna  suppresses
sidelobes while reducing the effective antenna aperture area. The phase and amplitude control of the antenna
illumination determines the achievable sidelobe suppression and angle measurement accuracy.
