At this point, it is instructive to make some general comments about the
equations produced by the node method. Although the actual collection of con-
ductance terms in Equation 3.8 is not particularly educational in this somewhat
contrived example, the general form of the equation is useful. The right-hand
side has two terms, one for each source, and these source terms enter the
