So far in pulse modulation, the same general rules apply as in AM. In view (C) the amplitude of the
square wave of voltage is equal to the peak voltage of the unmodulated carrier wave. This is 100-percent
modulation, just as in conventional AM. Note in the frequency spectrum that the sideband distribution is
also the same as in AM. Keep in mind that the total sideband power is 1/2 of the total power when the
modulator signal is a square wave. This is in contrast to 1/3 the total power with sine-wave modulation.
