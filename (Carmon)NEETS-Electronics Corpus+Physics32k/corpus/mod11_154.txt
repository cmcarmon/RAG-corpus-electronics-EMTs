left side of the electron's path and subtracts from the permanent magnetic field on the right side. This 
action weakens the field on the right side; therefore, the electron path bends to the right (clockwise). If the 
strength of the magnetic field is increased, the path of the electron will have a sharper bend. Likewise, if 
the velocity of the electron increases, the field around it increases and the path will bend more sharply.
