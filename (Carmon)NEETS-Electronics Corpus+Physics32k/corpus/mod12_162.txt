If the carrier and the modulating signal are constant in amplitude, the sum and difference frequencies 
will also be constant in amplitude. However, when the carrier and sidebands are combined in a single 
impedance and viewed simultaneously with an oscilloscope, the resultant waveform appears as shown in 
figure 1-39. This resultant wave is called the MODULATION ENVELOPE. The modulation envelope 
has the same frequency as the carrier. However, it rises and falls in amplitude with the continual phase 
shift between the carrier and sidebands. This causes these signals to first aid and then oppose one another. 
These cyclic variations in the amplitude of the envelope have the same frequency as the audio-modulating
