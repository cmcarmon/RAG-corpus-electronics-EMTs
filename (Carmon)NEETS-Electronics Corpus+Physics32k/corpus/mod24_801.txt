Biphase, or Manchester, encoding incorporates a transition into each bit period to maintain timing
information. In Manchester encoding, a high-to-low light level transition occurring in the middle of the
bit duration represents a binary 1. A low-to-high light level transition occurring in the middle of the bit
duration represents a binary 0.
