To eliminate high base current requirements, Darlington con-
ﬁgurations are commonly used. They are available in monolithic
or  in  isolated  packages.  The  basic  Darlington  conﬁguration  is
shown schematically in Fig. 30.4. The Darlington conﬁguration
presents a speciﬁc advantage in that it can considerably increase
the current switched by the transistor for a given base drive. The
V
 for the Darlington is generally more than that of a single
transistor of similar rating with corresponding increase in on-
state power loss. During switching, the reverse-biased collector
junction may show hot spot breakdown effects that are speciﬁed
by  reverse-bias  safe  operating  area  (RBSOA)  and  forward  bias
safe operating area (FBSOA). Modern devices with highly inter-
digited emitter base geometry force more uniform current dis-
tribution and therefore considerably improve second breakdown
effects.  Normally,  a  well-designed  switching  aid  network  con-
strains the device operation well within the SOAs.
