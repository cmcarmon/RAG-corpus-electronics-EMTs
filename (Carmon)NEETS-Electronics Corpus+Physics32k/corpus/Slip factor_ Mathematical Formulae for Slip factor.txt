Mathematically, Slip factor denoted by 'σ' is defined as the ratio of the actual & ideal values of the whirl velocity components at the exit of impeller. The ideal values can be calculated using analytical approach while the actual values should be observed experimentally.

where,
V'w2 : Actual Whirl Velocity Component ,
Vw2  : Ideal Whirl Velocity Component
Usually,σ varies from 0-1 with an average ranging from 0.8-0.9 .
The Slip Velocity is given as:
VS = Vw2 - V'w2 = Vw2(1-σ)
The Whirl Velocity is given as:
V'w2 = σ Vw2
