Standard Light Source—Equivalent Black Blackbody
Because the emissivity of incandescent materials is less than 1, an equivalent source is needed for measurement
and calibration purposes. This is formed by using an enclosed space which has a small opening in it. Provided
the opening is much smaller than the enclosed area, the radiation from the opening will be nearly equal to that
from a blackbody at the same temperature, as long as the interior surface emissivity is > 0.5. Blackbody radiation
from such a source at the melting point of platinum is deﬁned as 1/60 cd/cm2.
