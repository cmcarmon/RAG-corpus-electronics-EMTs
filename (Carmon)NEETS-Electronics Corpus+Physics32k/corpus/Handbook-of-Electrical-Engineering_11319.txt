Ampliﬁer
The purpose of the ampliﬁer sense system is to reliably detect the rate of electrical activity on the heart so that
the ICD can determine if there is a need for intervention. The ampliﬁer must be immune to noise and be able
to quickly respond to a large range of heart rates (30 to 360 b.p.m.) [Warren et al., 1996]. In order to obtain an
accurate heart rate, it is desirable to digitally count R waves, while rejecting all other electrical activity and noise.
Since the R wave is much larger in amplitude than the other waves in the electrogram, a simple method to detect
them would be to use a comparator with a set threshold. Unfortunately, the amplitude of R waves is not constant;
therefore,  a  simple  comparator  circuit  is  not  reliable.  For  example,  during  tachycardias  and  ﬁbrillation,  the
amplitude of the signals decreases signiﬁcantly. One technique commonly used to solve this is to use a dynamically
adjusting comparator threshold, in which the threshold level exponentially decreases over time until the next
R wave  is  detected,  at  which  time,  the  threshold  level  is  reset  [Brumwell  et al.,  1996].  This  ensures  that  low-
amplitude signals will be detected. Another technique is to use an automatic gain control to slowly increase the
gain between detected R waves, while keeping the threshold constant [Brumwell et al., 1996]. To avoid double
counting  caused  by  undesired  T-wave  detection,  there  is,  typically,  a  brief  period  of  time  after  each  detected
R wave  during  which  sensed  signals  are  ignored.  Detection  schemes  are  often  implemented  with  carefully
designed analog chips, known as Application Speciﬁc Integrated Circuits (ASICs), in order to keep the current
drain on the order of 10 µA [Warren et al., 1996]. An advantage of these chips is that they provide near-perfect
component matching, which is critical in engineering predictable gain control and frequency response.
