The test signal you apply to the diode is also connected to the horizontal input of the oscilloscope.
The horizontal sweep will then display the voltage applied to the diode under test. The voltage developed
across current-measuring resistor R2 is applied to the vertical input of the oscilloscope. Since this voltage
is proportional to the current through the diode under test, the vertical deflection will indicate diode
current. The resulting oscilloscope trace will be similar to the curve shown in figure 2-8.
