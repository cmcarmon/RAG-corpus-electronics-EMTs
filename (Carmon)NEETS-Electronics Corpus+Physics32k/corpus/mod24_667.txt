Superluminescence occurs when the spontaneous emissions of an ELED experience gain due to
higher injected currents and reflections from facets. Superluminescent diodes (SLDs) are differentiated
from both conventional LEDs and LDs. Although the output is not fully coherent, SLDs emit light that
consists of amplified spontaneous emissions. The spectral width and beam angle of SLDs are narrower
than that of conventional LEDs and wider than that of LDs.
