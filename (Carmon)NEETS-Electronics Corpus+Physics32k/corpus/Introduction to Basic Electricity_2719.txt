Figure 25-3B is a high-pass filter. The input is 
 applied across the inductor and resistor, and the 
 output is taken across the inductor. At high frequen-
cies, the inductive reactance of the coil is high, caus-
ing most of the voltage to be dropped across the coil. 
As the frequency decreases, the inductive reactance 
decreases, offering less opposition to the current 
flow. This causes less voltage to be dropped across the 
coil and more voltage to be dropped across the resis-
tor. The frequency above or below the frequencies 
passed or attenuated is called the cutoff	frequency. 
The symbol for the cutoff frequency is fco. The cutoff 
 frequency can be determined by the formula:
