Although not full test case generators, many supplemental testing tools are available that provide services
such as creating matrices of how test cases interact with functions and modules. Also widely used are record
and playback tools which capture all events during testing. One of the more widely used testing tool classes is
that of test coverage analyzers. Test coverage analyzers dynamically monitor the code that is being executed while
test cases are being run, and then report on any code or paths that may have been missed. Test coverage is not
the  same  as  removal  efﬁciency:  it  is  possible  to  execute  100%  of  the  instructions  in  a  software  application
without ﬁnding 100% of the bugs. However, for areas of code that are not executed at all, the removal efﬁciency
may be zero. Software defect tracking systems are exceptionally useful.
