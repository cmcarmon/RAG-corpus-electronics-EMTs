Plugging in to connectors
If you look at a cable — say, the one that goes from your set‐top box to 
your TV— you see that it has metal or plastic doodads on each end. These 
doodads are called plugs, and they represent one kind of connector. There 
are also metal or plastic receptacles on your set‐top box and TV that these 
cable ends fit into. These receptacles (sometimes called sockets or jacks) are 
another kind of connector. The various pins and holes in connectors connect 
the appropriate wire in the cable to the corresponding wire in the device.
