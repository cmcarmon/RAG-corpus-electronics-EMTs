An additional interesting observation can be made related
to the structure of the second-order circuit in Figure 4.17(B).
We have labeled the circuit in the dashed box a gyrator. A
gyrator is a circuit whose input impedance is proportional to
the reciprocal of the load impedance. Figure 4.18(A) shows the
situation for a load capacitor. From this circuit, we derive that
the input impedance equals:
