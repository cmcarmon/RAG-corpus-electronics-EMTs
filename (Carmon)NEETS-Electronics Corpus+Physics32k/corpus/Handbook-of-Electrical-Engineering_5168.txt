Electroacoustic Smart Materials
Although classically the nonlinear interaction of a vibrational (acoustic) wave and an electromagnetic wave has
been  studied  in  reference  to  Raman  active  media,  relevant  concepts  can  be  exercised  for  smart  engineering
applications using those materials that exhibit strong vibrational versus piezoelectric characteristics. The NTK
piezorubber, PZT ceramics, LiNBO3, PZT with donor additives, insolvent additives, etc. are viable candidates
for smart applications in addition to piezoelectric polymers.
