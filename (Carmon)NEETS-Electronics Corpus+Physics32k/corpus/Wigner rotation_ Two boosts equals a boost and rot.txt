The answer to the question lies in the Thomas rotation, and that one must be careful in specifying which coordinate system is involved at each step. When viewed from Σ, the coordinate axes of Σ and Σ′′ are not parallel. While this can be hard to imagine since both pairs (Σ, Σ′) and (Σ′, Σ′′) have parallel coordinate axes, it is easy to explain mathematically.
Velocity addition does not provide a complete description of the relation between the frames. One must formulate the complete description in terms of Lorentz transformations corresponding to the velocities. A Lorentz boost with any velocity v (magnitude less than c) is given symbolically by





X
′

=
B
(

v

)
X


{\displaystyle X'=B(\mathbf {v} )X}

where the coordinates and transformation matrix are compactly expressed in block matrix form

and in turn, r, r′, v are column vectors (the matrix transpose of these are row vectors), and γv is the Lorentz factor of velocity v. The boost matrix is a symmetric matrix. The inverse transformation is given by

{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {v} )^{-1}=B(-\mathbf {v} )\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=B(-\mathbf {v} )X'}

It is clear that to each admissible velocity v there corresponds a pure Lorentz boost,





v

↔
B
(

)
.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \leftrightarrow B(\mathbf {v} ).}

Velocity addition u⊕v corresponds to the composition of boosts B(v)B(u) in that order. The B(u) acts on X first, then B(v) acts on B(u)X. Notice succeeding operators act on the left in any composition of operators, so B(v)B(u) should be interpreted as a boost with velocities u then v, not v then u.

Here γ is the composite Lorentz factor, and a and b are 3×1 column vectors proportional to the composite velocities. The 3×3 matrix M will turn out to have geometric significance.

If the relative velocities are exchanged, looking at the blocks of Λ, one observes the composite transformation to be the matrix transpose of Λ. This is not the same as the original matrix, so the composite Lorentz transformation matrix is not symmetric, and thus not a single boost. This in turn translates to the incompleteness of velocity composition from the result of two boosts, symbolically;




B

u

)

B
(

)
B
(

.


{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {u} \oplus \mathbf {v} )\neq B(\mathbf {v} )B(\mathbf {u} )\,.}

To make the description complete, it is necessary to introduce a rotation, before or after the boost. This rotation is the Thomas rotation. A rotation is given by





X
′

=
R
(

θ

)
X


{\displaystyle X'=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})X}

where the 4×4 rotation matrix is




R

θ

R

(

θ

)



]




{\displaystyle R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&\mathbf {R} ({\boldsymbol {\theta }})\end{bmatrix}}}

and R is a 3×3 rotation matrix. In this article the axis-angle representation is used, and θ = θe is the "axis-angle vector", the angle θ multiplied by a unit vector e parallel to the axis. Also, the right-handed convention for the spatial coordinates is used (see orientation (vector space)), so that rotations are positive in the anticlockwise sense according to the right-hand rule, and negative in the clockwise sense. With these conventions; the rotation matrix rotates any 3d vector about the axis e through angle θ anticlockwise (an active transformation), which has the equivalent effect of rotating the coordinate frame clockwise about the same axis through the same angle (a passive transformation).
The rotation matrix is an orthogonal matrix, its transpose equals its inverse, and negating either the angle or axis in the rotation matrix corresponds to a rotation in the opposite sense, so the inverse transformation is readily obtained by

X

.


{\displaystyle R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{-1}=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})^{\mathrm {T} }=R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }})\quad \Rightarrow \quad X=R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }})X'\,.}

A boost followed or preceded by a rotation is also Lorentz transformation, since these operations leave the spacetime interval invariant. The same Lorentz transformation has two decompositions for appropriately chosen rapidity and axis-angle vectors;




Λ
(

θ

,

u

)
=
R
(

θ

)
B
(

u

)


{\displaystyle \Lambda ({\boldsymbol {\theta }},\mathbf {u} )=R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})B(\mathbf {u} )}





Λ
(

v

,

θ

)
=
B
(

v

)
R
(

θ

)


{\displaystyle \Lambda (\mathbf {v} ,{\boldsymbol {\theta }})=B(\mathbf {v} )R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})}

and if these are two decompositions are equal, the two boosts are related by




B
(

u

)
=
R
(
−

θ

)
B
(

v

)
R
(

θ

)


{\displaystyle B(\mathbf {u} )=R(-{\boldsymbol {\theta }})B(\mathbf {v} )R({\boldsymbol {\theta }})}

so the boosts are related by a matrix similarity transformation.
It turns out the equality between two boosts and a rotation followed or preceded by a single boost is correct: the rotation of frames matches the angular separation of the composite velocities, and explains how one composite velocity applies to one frame, while the other applies to the rotated frame. The rotation also breaks the symmetry in the overall Lorentz transformation making it nonsymmetric. For this specific rotation, let the angle be ε and the axis be defined by the unit vector e, so the axis-angle vector is ε = εe.
Altogether, two different orderings of two boosts means there are two inequivalent transformations. Each of these can be split into a boost then rotation, or a rotation then boost, doubling the number of inequivalent transformations to four. The inverse transformations are equally important; they provide information about what the other observer perceives. In all, there are eight transformations to consider, just for the problem of two Lorentz boosts. In summary, with subsequent operations acting on the left, they are
Matching up the boosts followed by rotations, in the original setup, an observer in Σ notices Σ′′ to move with velocity u⊕v then rotate clockwise (first diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ′′ notices Σ to move with velocity −v⊕u then rotate anticlockwise (second diagram). If the velocities are exchanged an observer in Σ notices Σ′′ to move with velocity v⊕u then rotate anticlockwise (third diagram), and because of the rotation an observer in Σ′′ notices Σ to move with velocity −u⊕v then rotate clockwise (fourth diagram).
The cases of rotations then boosts are similar (no diagrams are shown). Matching up the rotations followed by boosts, in the original setup, an observer in Σ notices Σ′′ to rotate clockwise then move with velocity v⊕u, and because of the rotation an observer in Σ′′ notices Σ to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity −u⊕v. If the velocities are exchanged an observer in Σ notices Σ′′ to rotate anticlockwise then move with velocity u⊕v, and because of the rotation an observer in Σ′′ notices Σ to rotate clockwise then move with velocity −u⊕v.
