vI as a constant amplitude sinusoid?
In spite of your answers to parts (b) and (c), assume that you choose Rf = 10 k
and that capacitor CL is very large. In order to reduce low frequency noise, you
decide that you should make the lower half-power frequency 100 radians per second.
What value of Ci should be selected? You also want to filter high-frequency noise
by making the upper half-power frequency 105 radians per second. What value of
Cf should be selected?
