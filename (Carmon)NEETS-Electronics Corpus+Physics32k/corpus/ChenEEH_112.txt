The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 refer to the vectors corresponding to
the current sources, RLC elements, and voltage sources, re-
spectively. Let Bf be the fundamental circuit matrix of N, and
let Qf be the fundamental cutset matrix of N with respect to T.
The KVL and the KCL equations can then be written as
follows:
