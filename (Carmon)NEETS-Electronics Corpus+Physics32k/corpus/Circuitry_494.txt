The noise  margin  for standard 7400 series TTL is 
typically 400 mV while that for CMOS is 1/3VDD,
as shown in Fig. 10.31. 
  Table  10.9  compares 
important 
characteristics  of  common  members  of  the  TTL 
family  with 
logic 
counterparts.  Finally,  Fig.  10.32  shows 
the 
packages  and  pin  connections  for  two  common 
logic devices, the 74LS00 (quad two-input NAND 
gate)  and  the  4001UBE  (quad  two-input  NOR 
gate).
