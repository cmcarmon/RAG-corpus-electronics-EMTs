Reliability—if one station is disabled or if the ﬁber breaks—is a problem in both ﬁber and wire rings. To
address these reliability problems, a double-ring optical network can provide for bypass of defective stations
and loop back around a ﬁber break. Each station has two inputs and two outputs connected to two rings that
operate in opposite directions; this, of course, increases the cost.
