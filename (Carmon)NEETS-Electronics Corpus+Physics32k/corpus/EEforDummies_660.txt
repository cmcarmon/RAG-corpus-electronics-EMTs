Close the circuit by placing your finger across the open circuit, as shown in 
Figure 10-12 (don’t worry, my ten‐year‐old son didn’t get hurt and you won’t 
either). Did the LED turn on? When you close the circuit, your skin conducts 
a teeny tiny current (a few microamps), which is amplified by the pair of tran-
sistors, lighting the LED.
