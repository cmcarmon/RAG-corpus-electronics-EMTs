Thomas Edison discovered the principle of thermionic emission as he looked for ways to keep soot
from clouding his incandescent light bulb. Edison placed a metal plate inside his bulb along with the
normal filament. He left a gap, a space, between the filament and the plate. He then placed a battery in
series between the plate and the filament, with the positive side toward the plate and the negative side
toward the filament. This circuit is shown in figure 1-2.
