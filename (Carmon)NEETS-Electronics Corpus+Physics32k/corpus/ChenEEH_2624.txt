Figure 7.46 presents typical geometries of strip line and
waveguide H-plane junction circulators. In the strip line junc-
tion geometry, two ferrite disks are stacked between the two
ground planes and the center metallic disk, forming a resonant
cavity. Three external strip lines are symmetrically connected
to the periphery of the center disk at 1208 intervals and form
three ports of the circulators. The static magnetic Ô¨Åeld is
applied normal to the ground planes. In the waveguide junc-
tion, a cylindrical ferrite or other shaped ferrite is placed in a
usually ridged or stepped Y-junction. This ridge or step form is
also used to provide impedance match to the three external
waveguide ports.
