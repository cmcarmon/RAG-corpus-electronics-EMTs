An additional point of interest is whether when a solution to Eq. (100.120) exists the predicted limit cycle
is stable. When there is only one intersection point, the stability of the limit cycle can be found using the Loeb
criterion which states that if the Nyquist stability criterion indicates instability (stability) for the point on C(a)
with a < a0 and stability (instability) for the point on C(a) with a > a0 the limit cycle is stable (unstable).
