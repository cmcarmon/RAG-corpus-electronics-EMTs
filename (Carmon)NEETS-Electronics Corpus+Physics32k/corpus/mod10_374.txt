This scattering mode of propagation enables vhf and uhf signals to be transmitted far beyond the 
normal line-of-sight. To better understand how these signals are transmitted over greater distances, you 
must first consider the propagation characteristics of the space wave used in vhf and uhf line-of-sight 
communications. When the space wave is transmitted, it undergoes very little attenuation within the 
line-of-sight horizon. When it reaches the horizon, the wave is diffracted and follows the Earth's 
curvature. Beyond the horizon, the rate of attenuation increases very rapidly and signals soon become 
very weak and unusable.
