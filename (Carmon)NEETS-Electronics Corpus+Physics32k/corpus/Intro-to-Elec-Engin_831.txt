concerns seem to demand inherently safe reactor designs with standardized, modular construction
of nuclear units. Since the major U.S. hydroelectric sites (except in Alaska) have been fully
developed, one can foresee a trend for continuing percentage decline in hydroelectric energy
generation.
By the year 2000, the total U.S. generating capacity has reached 817 GW (1 GW= 1000 MW)
and continues to grow. Current lead times of about a decade for the construction and licensing of
large coal-ﬁred units may cause insufﬁcient reserve margins in some regions of the United States.
As of 1989, U.S. transmission systems consisted of about 146,600 circuit-miles of high-
voltage transmission. During the 1990s, additions have totalled up to 13,350 circuit-miles, which
include 230-kV, 345-kV, and 500-kV lines. Because of the right-of-way costs, the possibility of
six-phase transmission (instead of the current three-phase transmission) is being looked into.
