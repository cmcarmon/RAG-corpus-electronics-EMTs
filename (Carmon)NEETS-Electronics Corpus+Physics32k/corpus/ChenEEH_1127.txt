There are two basic approaches to imaging infrared radiation
with arrays of small elements. The ﬁrst involves cooling an
array of narrow band-gap semiconductor elements to low
temperatures to reduce the thermal noise level and allow
measurement of weak thermal radiation. The second is to
isolate the infrared absorbing element from surrounding solids
that would couple energy from the element. Doing so involves
etching away a sacriﬁcial layer under each picture element
(pixel), leaving it suspended by ﬁne legs that conduct relatively
little heat from the element. The legs are also the current paths
used for measuring the resistance of the material on each
element
infrared radiation. The associated
heating, actually only a few one-thousandths of a degree, is
enough to produce a measurable change in the resistance of
the pixel. This MEMS approach has the tremendous advantage
of not requiring a cooling system, so it is simpler and cheaper
than semiconductor infrared detector arrays although it is not
as sensitive to weak signals.
