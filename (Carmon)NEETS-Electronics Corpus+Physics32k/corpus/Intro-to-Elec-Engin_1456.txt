Figure 15.2.16 shows a block diagram of an FM demodulator with feedback (FMFB), in
which the FM discrimination is placed in a feedback system that uses a VCO path for feedback.
The bandwidth of the discriminator and the subsequent low-pass ﬁlter is matched with that of the
message signal, which is the output of the low-pass ﬁlter.
