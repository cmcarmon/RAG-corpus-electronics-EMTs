The agc voltages in a receiver provide controlled degenerative feedback. By adjusting the operating
point of an amplifier, you can control the gain. Under no-signal conditions, bias of the rf and IF amplifiers
is developed by standard means, such as self bias. With an applied signal, an agc voltage is developed,
which in conjunction with normal biasing methods develops the operating bias for the amplifiers.
