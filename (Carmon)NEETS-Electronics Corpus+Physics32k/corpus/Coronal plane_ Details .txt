The coronal plane is an example of a longitudinal plane, because it is perpendicular to the transverse plane. For a human, the mid-coronal plane would transect a standing body into two halves (front and back, or anterior and posterior) in an imaginary line that cuts through both shoulders. The description of the coronal plane applies to most animals as well as humans even though humans walk upright and the various planes are usually shown in the vertical orientation.
Abduction and adduction are terms for movements of limbs relative to the coronal plane.
The sternal plane (planum sternale) is a coronal plane which transects the front of the sternum.
