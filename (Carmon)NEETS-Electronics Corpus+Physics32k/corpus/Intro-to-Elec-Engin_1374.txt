With the invention of the telephone, telephony came into being and the Bell Telephone
Company was established in 1877. Transcontinental telephone transmission became operational
in 1915. Automatic switching was another important advance, and a digital switch was placed in
service in 1960. Numerous signiﬁcant advances have taken place in telephone communications
over the past four decades. For example, ﬁber-optic cables have replaced copper wire, and
electronic switches have come into use in place of electromechanical devices.
