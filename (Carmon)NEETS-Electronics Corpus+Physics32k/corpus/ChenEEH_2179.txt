Example 1.12
The geometry shown in Figure 1.8 is an excellent canonical
problem to illustrate the salient features of permanent magnet
circuits. Assume a small cross-section and ignore all leakage
ﬂux. The ﬁrst topic is to show the steps necessary to determine
B in this problem, which is the same in the gap and the magnet
because of the boundary condition shown in equation 1.52. To
do this, two equations will be solved simultaneously. The ﬁrst
equation is the hysteresis curve for the permanent magnet,
which is shown in Figure 1.9.
