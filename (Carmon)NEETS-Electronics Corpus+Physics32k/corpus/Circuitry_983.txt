Thus ‘A AND B’ can be written (A (cid:127) B) whereas 
‘A OR  B’ is  written  (A + B).  The  bar  symbol,      , 
used  above  a  variable  (or  over  a  part  of  an 
expression) indicates inversion (the NOT function). 
Thus ‘NOT A’ is written A and ‘NOT (A AND B)’ 
is written A (cid:127) B. Note that A (cid:127) B is not the same as 
A (cid:127) B.
