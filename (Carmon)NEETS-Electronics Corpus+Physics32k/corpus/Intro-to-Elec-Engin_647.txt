which is the load-line equation. The device equation (Boltzmann diode equation) and
the load-line equation involve two variables, I and V, whose values must satisfy both
equations simultaneously. As seen from Figure E7.2.5(b), Q is the only condition
satisfying the restrictions imposed by both the diode and the external circuit. The
intersection Q of the two curves is called the quiescent or operating point, indicated
by the diode current IQ and the diode voltage VQ.
