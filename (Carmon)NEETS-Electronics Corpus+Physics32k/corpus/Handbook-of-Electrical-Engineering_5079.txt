diodes. The piezoresistivity of semiconductors and optical sensing by the photodiode were already discussed.
Diodes are also used as temperature-sensing devices. When forward-biased with a constant diode current, the
resulting diode voltage increases approximately linearly with increasing temperature. The ﬁrst micromachined
microsensor to be commercially produced was the silicon pressure sensor. It was invented in the mid-to-late

1950s at Bell Labs and commercialized in the 1960s. This device contains a thin silicon diaphragm (
which is produced by chemical etching. The diaphragm deforms in response to a pressure difference across it
(Fig. 56.3). The deformation produces two effects: a position-dependent displacement which is maximum at
the  diaphragm  center  and  position-dependent  strain  which  is  maximum  near  the  diaphragm  edge.  Both  of
these effects have been used in microsensors to produce an electrical output which is proportional to differential
pressure. The membrane displacement is sensed capacitively as previously described in one type of pressure
sensor. The strain is sensed in another by placing a piezoresistor, fabricated in the same silicon substrate, along
one edge of the diaphragm. The two leads of the piezoresistor are connected to a Wheatstone bridge. The latter
type of sensor is called a piezoresistive pressure sensor and is the commercially more common type of pressure
microsensor. Pressure microsensors constituted about 5% of the total U.S. consumption of pressure sensors in
1991. Most of them are used in the medical industry as disposables due to their low cost and small, rugged
construction. Many other types of microsensors are commercially under development, including accelerome-
ters, mass ﬂow rate sensors, and biosensors.
