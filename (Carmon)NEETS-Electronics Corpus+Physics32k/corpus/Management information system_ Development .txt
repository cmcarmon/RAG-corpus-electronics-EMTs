"The actions that are taken to create an information system that solves an organizational problem are called system development". These include system analysis, system design, computer programming/implementation, testing, conversion, production and finally maintenance.
Conversion is the process of changing or converting the old system into the new. This can be done in three basic ways:
Direct cut â€“ The new system replaces the old at an appointed time.
Parallel implementation - both old and new systems run at the same time until developers are certain the new system is operating correctly.
Pilot study - Introducing the new system to a small portion of the operation to see how it fares. If results are good then the new system expands to the rest of the company.
