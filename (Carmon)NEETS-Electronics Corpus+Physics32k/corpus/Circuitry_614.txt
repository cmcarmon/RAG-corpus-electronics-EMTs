parallel tuned circuit (L1 and C1) which exhibits a 
very  high  impedance  at  the  signal  frequency.  A 
secondary  coupling  winding,  L2, is  used  to  match 
the  diode 
the 
demodulator circuit to the high  impedance of the 
input tuned circuit. Diode, D1, acts as a half-wave 
rectifier  conducting  only  on  positive-going  half-
cycles of the radio frequency signal. Capacitor, C1,
charges  to  the  peak  value  of  each  positive-going 
half-cycle that appears at the cathode of D1.
The  voltage  that  appears  across  C1
