Let us assume that a square-wave signal such as a clock with time period T is fed to the
input of the inverter as shown in Figure 11.19. Further assume that the inverter drives
a load capacitor CL. We shall compute the power dissipated by the inverter for this
signal. A signal that transitions every cycle will result in the worst-case dynamic power
dissipation.
