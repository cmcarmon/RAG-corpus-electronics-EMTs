which exposes 24 of the 128. A program can ask the machine to raise or lower the blind by 16 registers. That
leaves an overlap of eight between successive yanks or rewinds. This arrangement is called a multiple overlapping
register set (MORS). If you think of starting with register r8 at the bottom and r31 at the top, a yank of 16 on
the blind will now have r49 at the top and r24 at the bottom. r24 to r31 are shared between the old set and
the new. To avoid having to keep track of which registers are showing, the set of 24 are divided into what came
in from the last set, those that are only local, and those that will go out to the next set. These names apply to
going toward increasing numbers. In going the other direction, the ins of the current set will become the outs
of the next set. Almost all other machines keep their registers screwed down to the local masonry, but you will
see in a moment how useful a MORS can be. (Like other useful but expensive accessories, the debate is always
on whether it is worth it [Patterson and Hennessy, 1989].)
