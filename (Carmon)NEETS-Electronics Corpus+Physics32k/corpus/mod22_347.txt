Spreadsheets are tables of rows and columns of numbers. Figure 3-10 shows an example. 
Spreadsheet processors allow you to set up a table of rows and columns and specify what calculations to 
perform on the columns. You enter values for the basic information into the appropriate rows and 
columns. Then the processor performs the calculations. In our example (fig. 3-10), we used a spreadsheet 
to project magnetic media costs. You enter the item descriptions, column headings, report title, and data 
for columns 1, 2, and 4, and the software calculates column 3 by adding columns 1 and 2. Then it 
multiplies column 3 times column 4 and puts the result in column 5. It also subtotals and totals the 
columns you specify; in this case, columns 1 through 3 and column 5.
