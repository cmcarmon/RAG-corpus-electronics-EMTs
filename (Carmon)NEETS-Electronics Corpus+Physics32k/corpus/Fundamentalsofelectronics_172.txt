Equivalent circuits can be used in two basic ways. The ﬁrst is to simplify the analysis of a complicated
circuit by realizing the any portion of a circuit can be described by either a Thévenin or Mayer-Norton
equivalent. Which one is used depends on whether what is attached to the terminals is a series conﬁguration
(making the Thévenin equivalent the best) or a parallel one (making Mayer-Norton the best).
