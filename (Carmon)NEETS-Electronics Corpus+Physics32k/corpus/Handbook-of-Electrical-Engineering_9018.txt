Step 4—Transfer of Toner to Paper. Here a corona is used to charge the back side of the paper and the toner
is transferred from the PC to the paper. Typically, some small fraction of the toner usually has a charge of the
wrong  sign.  It  is  at  this  step  where  most  of  this  wrong-sign  toner  is  removed,  minimizing “background”  on
the page, since primarily only toner with the correct sign gets transferred.
