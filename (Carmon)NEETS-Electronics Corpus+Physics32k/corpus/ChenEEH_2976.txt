techniques including load-pull and nonlinear modeling for an
adequate design. This section discusses the basics of transistor
ampliﬁer design in terms of S-parameters. The basic concepts
will be the same for both small-signal and large-signal ampli-
ﬁer design. However, large-signal ampliﬁer design requires that
large-signal S-parameters be available.
