Practical exploitation of Eq. (116.5) depends on electronically detecting the motion of the ionized charge in
an  electric  ﬁeld.  The  signal-to-noise  ratio  is  improved  by  reducing  current  ﬂow  in  the  detector  from  other
mechanisms. In germanium, this is achieved by producing a rectifying and a blocking contact and by cooling
to about 100K. For a planar detector, a slice of high-purity germanium is diffused with the donor lithium on
one side, forming a strongly n-type layer. The opposite side is implanted with the acceptor boron, forming a
p+  layer.  When  voltage  is  properly  applied,  the  electric  ﬁeld  direction  prevents  the  majority  carriers  in  the
contact regions from being injected across the device. As the voltage is applied, a region depleted of holes will
advance into the slice from the n+ contact if the slice is p-type. If the slice is n-type, the a region depleted of
electrons will advance from the p+ contact. At the depletion voltage Vd, the depletion region reaches the opposite
contact. For germanium:
