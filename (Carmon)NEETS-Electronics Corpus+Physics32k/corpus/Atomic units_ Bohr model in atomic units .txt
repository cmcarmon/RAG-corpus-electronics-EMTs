Atomic units are chosen to reflect the properties of electrons in atoms. This is particularly clear from the classical Bohr model of the hydrogen atom in its ground state. The ground state electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus has (in the classical Bohr model):
Orbital velocity = 1
Orbital radius = 1
Angular momentum = 1
Orbital period = 2π
Ionization energy = ​1⁄2
Electric field (due to nucleus) = 1
Electrical attractive force (due to nucleus) = 1
