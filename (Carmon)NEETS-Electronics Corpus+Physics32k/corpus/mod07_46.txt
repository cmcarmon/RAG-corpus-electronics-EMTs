Although the semiconductor was known long before the electron tube was invented, the
semiconductor devices of that time could not match the performance of the tube. Radio needed a device
that could not only handle power and amplify but rectify and detect a signal as well. Since tubes could do
all these things, whereas semiconductor devices of that day could not, the semiconductor soon lost out.
