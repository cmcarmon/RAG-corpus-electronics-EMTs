The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable "L" shape, hence the name "L-sit". It requires significant abdominal strength.
When executing an L-sit, a variety of supports may be used by the performer, including gymnastics apparatus such as the floor, rings, parallel bars or parallettes, or the hands of an adagio partner.
The performer's legs may be held together in front of the body or, in a variant called the straddled L-sit, the legs may be separated so that they straddle the arms.
