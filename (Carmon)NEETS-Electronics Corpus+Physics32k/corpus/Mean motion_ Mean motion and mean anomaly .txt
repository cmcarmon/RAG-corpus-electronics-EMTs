Mean motion also represents the rate of change of mean anomaly, and hence can also be calculated,

{\displaystyle n={\frac {M_{1}-M_{0}}{t}}}

where M1 and M0 are the mean anomalies at particular points in time, and t is the time elapsed between the two. M0 is referred to as the mean anomaly at epoch, and t is the time since epoch.
