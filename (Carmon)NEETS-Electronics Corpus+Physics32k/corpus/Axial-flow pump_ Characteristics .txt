The performance characteristics of an axial flow pump is shown in the figure. As shown in the figure, the head at the zero flow rate can be as much as three times the head at the pumpâ€™s best efficiency point. Also, the power requirement increases as the flow decreases, with the highest power drawn at the zero flow rate. This characteristic is opposite to that of a radial flow centrifugal pump where power requirement increases with an increase in the flow. Also the power requirements and pump head increases with an increase in pitch, thus allowing the pump to adjust according to the system conditions to provide the most efficient operation.
