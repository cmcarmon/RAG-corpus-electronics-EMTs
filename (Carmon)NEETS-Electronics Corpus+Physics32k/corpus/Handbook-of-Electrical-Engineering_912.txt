Pitfalls.
Occasionally SPICE will fail and give the message “Timestep too small in transient analysis”, which
means that the process of Newton iterations at certain time steps could not be made to converge. One of the
most common causes of this is the speciﬁcation of a capacitor with a value that is much too large, for example,
specifying a 1-F capacitor instead of a 1 pF capacitor (an easy mistake to make by not adding the “p” in the
value speciﬁcation). Unfortunately, we usually have no way to tell which capacitor is at fault from the type of
failure generated other than to manually search the input deck.
