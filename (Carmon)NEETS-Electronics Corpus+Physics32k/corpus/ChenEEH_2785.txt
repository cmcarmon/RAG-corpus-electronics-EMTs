ABCs cannot be directly obtained from the Yee algorithm
(1966) because it requires ﬁeld data on both sides of an
observation point and, hence, cannot be implemented at the
outermost planes of a space lattice. Although backward ﬁnite
differences could conceivably be used here, these are generally
of lower accuracy for a given space discretization and have not
been used in any major FDTD software.
