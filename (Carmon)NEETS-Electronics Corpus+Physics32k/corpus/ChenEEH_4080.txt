. Channel noise: Thermal noise, interference from other
users, and interference from circuit switching transients
can cause errors in detecting the pulses carrying the
digitized samples. Channel-induced errors can degrade
the reconstructed signal quality quite quickly. The rapid
degradation of the output signal quality with channel-
induced errors is called a threshold effect.
