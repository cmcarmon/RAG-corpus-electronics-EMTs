In a microprogrammed machine, the hardware is designed in terms of its capabilities (ALU, data paths, I/O,
processing units) with little concern for how these capabilities will have to be accessed by the programmers.
The microoperations are decoded from microinstructions. The way programmers view the machine is deÔ¨Åned
at the microprogramming level.
