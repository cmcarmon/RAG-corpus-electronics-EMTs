To permit determination of ~kk and ~vvp for any wave-propaga-
tion direction f, it would be very useful to derive closed-form
equations analogous to equations 9.35 and 9.36. However, for
this general case, the underlying dispersion relation 9.26 is a
transcendental equation. Taﬂove (1995) provided a useful al-
ternative approach for obtaining sample values of ~vvp by apply-
ing the following Newton’s method iterative procedure to
equation 9.26:
