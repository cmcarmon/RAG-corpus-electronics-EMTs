The RIC experiment is first performed with a n-dodecane–air–rock system to determine the constant ∁ of the Washburn Equation. N-dodecane imbibes into one of the core samples and the imbibition curve is recorded in Figure 2. Dodecane is an alkane that has low surface energy, very strongly wetting the rock sample in the presence of air, with contact angle θ equal to zero. Constant ∁ is determined by the contact angle value for dodecane/air/rock system, determining physical properties of n-dodecane (ρ,μ,γ) and rearranging equation 1;
