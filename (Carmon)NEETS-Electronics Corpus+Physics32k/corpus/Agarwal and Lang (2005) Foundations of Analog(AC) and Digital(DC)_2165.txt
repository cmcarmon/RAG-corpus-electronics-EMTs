The properties of filter circuits were explored previously in Chapters 10
and 13. As we did in Chapter 13, the circuit of Figure 15.23 can also be
analyzed using the impedance method by using impedance values 1/sC1 and
1/sC2 for the capacitors (see Section 15.6.4). We will also see other examples
of impedance based analysis for Op Amps later in this chapter.
