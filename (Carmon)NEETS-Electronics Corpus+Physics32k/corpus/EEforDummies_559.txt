handle before breaking down. For example, if the diode is rated at  
100 V, you shouldn’t use it in a circuit that applies more than 100 V to 
the diode. (Circuit designers build in considerable headroom above the 
PRV rating to accommodate voltage spikes and other conditions. For 
instance, it’s common practice to use a 1,000 V PRV rectifier diode in 
power supply circuits running on 120 VAC.)
