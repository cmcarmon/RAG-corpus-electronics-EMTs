The design of magnetic bearings involves the calculation of magnetic forces and stiffness
as part of designing an electromechanical servo system. In earlier days, the magnetic force
of a suspension block was calculated approximately, with reasonable accuracy, by assuming
simple straight ﬂux paths. However, higher magnetic ﬂux densities are increasingly used for
reducing the weight and size of magnetic bearings, particularly in the case of a single-axis servoed
magnetic bearing which utilizes fringing rings. In such cases the nonlinear characteristics of the
ferromagnetic materials become quite signiﬁcant; analytical techniques fail to yield sufﬁciently
accurate results. Hence it becomes essential to take recourse to numerical analysis of the nonlinear
magnetic ﬁelds with the aid of a high-speed digital computer in order to determine more accurately
the ﬂux distribution corresponding to various conditions of operation, compute leakage, and
evaluate forces at the air gap, so as to optimize the design of nonlinear magnetic bearings.
