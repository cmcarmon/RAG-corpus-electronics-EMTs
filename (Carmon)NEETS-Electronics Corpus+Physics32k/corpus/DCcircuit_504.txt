The critical assumption in this ”perfect” scheme, however, is that the voltage supply will
hold steady at its rated voltage while supplying an inﬁnite amount of current to a short-circuit
load. This is simply not realistic. Even if the short has a small amount of resistance (as opposed
to absolutely zero resistance), no real voltage source could arbitrarily supply a huge overload
current and maintain steady voltage at the same time. This is primarily due to the internal
resistance intrinsic to all electrical power sources, stemming from the inescapable physical
properties of the materials they’re constructed of:
