If a small light bulb were placed in the center of a large room, the illumination would be very poor. 
However, if a reflector were placed behind the bulb, the space in front of the reflector would be brighter 
and the space behind the reflector would be dimmer. The light rays would be concentrated. Also, if a lens 
were placed in front of the bulb, the light would be even more concentrated and a very bright spot would 
appear on the wall in front of the lens. A flashlight is a practical combination of the small bulb, the 
reflector, and the lens. The energy from an antenna can be reflected and concentrated in a similar manner.
