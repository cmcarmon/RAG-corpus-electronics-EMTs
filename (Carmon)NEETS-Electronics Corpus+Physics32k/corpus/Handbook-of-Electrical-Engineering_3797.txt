Most of the properties of the allowed modes in real waveguides can usually be found by assuming that the
walls are perfectly conducting. Under this condition, Ez = 0 and ¶Hz /¶p = 0 at the waveguide walls, where p
is  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  waveguide  wall.  When  these  conditions  are  imposed  upon  the  general
solutions  of  Eqs.  (37.60)  and  (37.61),  it  is  found  that  only  certain  values  of  h  are  allowed.  These  values  are
called the modal eigenvalues and are determined by the cross-sectional shape of the waveguide. Using Eq. (37.62),
the propagation constant g for each mode varies with frequency according to
