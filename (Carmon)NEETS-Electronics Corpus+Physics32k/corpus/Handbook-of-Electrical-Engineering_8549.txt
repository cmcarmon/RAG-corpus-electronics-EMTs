Diagonal Microinstructions
Most  cases  ﬁt  in  between  these  two  extremes  (see  Fig.  86.13).  Some  parallelism  is  possible;  however,  micro-
commands pertaining to a given processing unit are regrouped. This results in shorter microprograms than in
the  vertical  case  and  may  still  allow  some  optimization.  For  example,  a  diagonal  speciﬁcation  of  an  ALU
operation is as follows:
