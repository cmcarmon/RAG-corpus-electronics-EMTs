2. High-level synthesis: Synthesis converts the graph
representation from the algorithm compilation phase
into a behavioral description of hardware description
language (HDL), such as VHDL. Verilog HDL, and
Lola (Woods et al., 1997). The available tools include
ARREST (Burleson and Jung, 1992). DG2VHDL
(Stone and Manalokos, 2000). IRIS (Woods et al.,
1997), Khoros (Moorman and Cates, 1999), VACS
(Kung and Jean, 1988), and VASS (Yen et al., 1996).
