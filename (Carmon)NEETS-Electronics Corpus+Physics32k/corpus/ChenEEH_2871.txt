The basic role of the radar antenna is to act as a transducer
between the free space and the electromagnetic wave sources or
receivers. During transmission, it is used to concentrate the
radiated energy into a shaped beam or in a desired direction.
During reception, it is used to collect the echo signal and
deliver it to the receiver.
