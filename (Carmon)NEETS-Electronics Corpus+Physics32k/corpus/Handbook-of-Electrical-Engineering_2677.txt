The  starting  assumption  of  the  NTRS  is  that  Moore’s  law  will  continue  to  describe  the  growth  of  the
technology. The overall roadmap comprises many individual roadmaps which address deﬁned critical areas of
semiconductor  research,  development,  engineering,  and  manufacturing.  In  each  area,  needs  and  potential
solutions for each technology generation are reviewed. Of course, this process is more deﬁnitive for the early
generations because knowledge is more complete and the range of alternatives is restricted.
