Modern computer-aided control system design (CACSD) has been made possible by the synthesis of several
key  developments  in  computing.  The  development  and  continued  dominance  of  high-level  procedural  lan-
guages such as FORTRAN enabled the development and distribution of standard mathematical software. The
emergence of fully interactive operating systems such as UNIX and its user “shells” inﬂuenced the development
of CACSD packages which have been constructed along similar lines. The ready availability and cheapness of
raster-graphic displays has provided the on-screen display of data from control systems analysis, the creation
of tools for modeling control systems using familiar block diagrams and have the potential to make order-of-
magnitude improvements in the ease-of-use, ease-of-manipulation, and efﬁciency of the interaction between
the  control  designer,  his  model,  analysis  tools,  and  end-product—software  for  embedded  controllers.  The
driving force of all these developments is the seemingly continual increase in computing power year-on-year
and the result has been to make computers accessible to large numbers of people while at the same time making
them easier to use.
