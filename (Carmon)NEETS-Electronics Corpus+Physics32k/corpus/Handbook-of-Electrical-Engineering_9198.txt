The  basic,  underlying  philosophy  of  how  software  systems  should  be  developed  changed  dramatically  in
Structured  Analysis  and  System  Speciﬁcation
1978  when  Tom  DeMarco  published  his  truly  seminal  book, 
[DeMarco,  1979].  DeMarco  proposed  that  software  systems  should  be  developed  like  any  large,  complex
engineering  systems—by  ﬁrst  building  scale  models  of  proposed  systems  so  as  to  investigate  their  behavior.
 approach is analogous to that used by architects to specify and design
This 
large  complex  buildings  (see  Fig.  90.1). We  build  scale  models  of  software  systems  for  the  same  reason  that
architects build scale models of houses, so that users can visualize living with the systems of the future. These
models serve as vehicles for communication and negotiation between users, developers, sponsors, builders, etc.
Model-based software engineering holds considerable promise for enabling large, complex software systems to
be developed on budget, within schedule, while meeting user requirements [see Harel, 1992].
