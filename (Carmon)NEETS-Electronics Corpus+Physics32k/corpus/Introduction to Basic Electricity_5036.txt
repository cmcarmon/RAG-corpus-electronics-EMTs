Take the original artwork and transfer it to the back of 
the graph paper. Place the component side of the artwork 
to the surface of a light table or hold the  paper to a window 
with light on the opposite side. Start by placing Xs where 
each pad is located, and then  connect the pads with the 
trace lines. On the side just drawn, write “BOTTOM.”
