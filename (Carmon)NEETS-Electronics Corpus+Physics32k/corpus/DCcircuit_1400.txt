The capacitor voltage’s approach to 15 volts and the current’s approach to zero over time
is what a mathematician would call asymptotic: that is, they both approach their ﬁnal values,
getting closer and closer over time, but never exactly reaches their destinations. For all practi-
cal purposes, though, we can say that the capacitor voltage will eventually reach 15 volts and
that the current will eventually equal zero.
