If there is a given Calabi-Yau manifold (basically a space with 6 or more dimensions curled up in a special way) then a sphere in the center can shrink down to an infinitesimal point that resembles a singularity. After reaching the singularity-like point, the sphere tears and then a new sphere "blows up" to replace the torn one. The sphere in the mirror image (from Mirror symmetry) merely undergoes topologically smooth transition. The mathematical results from the separate manifolds result in the same physics, so no laws of physics or mathematics are violated.
