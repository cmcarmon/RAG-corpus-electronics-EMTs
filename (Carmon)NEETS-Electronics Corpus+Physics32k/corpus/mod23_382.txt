Data is stored on a floppy disk in circular tracks. Figure 8-2 shows a circular track on a floppy disk. 
The total number of tracks on a floppy disk is permanently set by (1) the number of steps the disk drive's 
magnetic head stepper motor can make, and (2) whether the disk drive has a magnetic head for one or 
both surfaces of the floppy disk. These two things will also determine the type of floppy disk that's 
needed. Each type of disk is rated with a number that represents how many tracks per inch (TPI) it can 
hold. Some common track capacities are 40, 48, 80, and 96 TPI.
