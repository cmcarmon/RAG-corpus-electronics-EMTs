Hybrid-Pi Equivalent Circuit
In order for a BJT to function properly in linear ampliﬁer applications, it must operate in the forward active
region of its volt–ampere characteristic curves. Two conditions ensure BJT operation in the forward domain.
First, the applied emitter-base terminal voltage must forward bias the intrinsic emitter-base junction diode at
all  times.  Second,  the  instantaneous  voltage  established  across  the  base-collector  terminals  of  the  transistor
must  preclude  a  forward  biased  intrinsic  base-collector  diode.  The  simultaneous  satisfaction  of  these  two
conditions requires appropriate biasing subcircuits, and it imposes restrictions on the amplitudes of applied
input signals [Clarke and Hess, 1978].
