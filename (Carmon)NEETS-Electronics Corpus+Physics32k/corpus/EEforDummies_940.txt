▶✓ Secure all wiring inside your project. Use a 
strain relief or a cable mount to secure the 
AC line cord to your project enclosure so 
you don’t expose a live wire. A strain relief 
(available at hardware stores and electron-
ics suppliers) clamps around the wire and 
prevents you from tugging the wire out of 
the enclosure.
