After choosing the materials and dimensions, the designer is
ready to start simulating the device to verify that the speciﬁed
materials and dimensions would yield the required perform-
ance. The relationship of the design and simulation phases of
MEMS development can be considered by reference to the
diagram in Figure 6.3. As noted in that ﬁgure, material prop-
erties impact both the design and simulation phases. That is,
the properties must be known adequately for the particular
processes and equipment in the fabrication facility or else the
simulated performance will not be accurate.
