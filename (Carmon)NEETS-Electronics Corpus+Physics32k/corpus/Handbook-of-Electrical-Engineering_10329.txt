The hub antenna consists of a parabolic reﬂector and associated electrical and mechanical support equipment.
The RF subsystem converts the modulated carrier to RF frequency, provides the necessary signal ampliﬁcation,
and transmits the resulting RF carrier to the antenna subsystem. It also receives RF signals from the antenna
subsystem,  provides  low-noise  ampliﬁcation,  RF/IF  conversion,  and  passes  the  resulting  IF  carriers  to  the
baseband  equipment  subsystem.  The  hub  baseband  equipment  consists  of  the  modem  equipment  and  the
processing  equipment.  The  hub  modems  employ  continuous  modulators  and  burst  demodulators.  The  pro-
cessing equipment interfaces to the modem equipment and provides the satellite access processing and protocol
processing for interface to the customer host.
