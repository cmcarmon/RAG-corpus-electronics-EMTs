Problems 
 
9.1   An amplifier with a gain of 8 has 10% of its 
output fed back to the input. Determine the 
 
gain  of 
 
(a)  with  negative 
 
feedback, (b) with positive feedback. 
9.2   A  phase-shift  oscillator  is  to  operate  with 
an output at 1 kHz. If the oscillator is based 
 
on a three-stage ladder network, determine 
 
 
the  required  values  of  resistance  if  three 
 
capacitors of 10 nF are to be used. 
9.3   A  Wien  bridge  oscillator  is  based  on  the 
circuit shown in Fig. 9.4 but Rl and R2 are 
 
 
replaced  by  a  dual-gang  potentiometer.  If 
C1 = C2 = 22 nF determine the values of 
 
Rl and R2 required to produce an output at 
 
 
exactly 400 Hz. 
9.4   Determine the peak-peak voltage developed 
across C1 in the oscillator circuit shown in 
 
 
Fig. 9.22.  
9.5  Determine the periodic time and frequency 
of  the  output  signal  produced  by  the 
 
 
oscillator circuit shown in Fig. 9.22.  
9.6   An astable multivibrator circuit is required 
to  produce  an  asymmetrical  rectangular 
 
output which has a period of 4 ms and is to 
 
 
be ‘high’ for 1 ms and ‘low’ for 3 ms. If the 
timing  capacitors  are  both  to  be  100  nF, 
 
determine  the  values  of  the  two  timing 
 
resistors required.
