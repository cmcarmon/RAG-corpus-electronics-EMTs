RESOLVERÂ—A rotary, electromechanical device used to perform trigonometric computations by varying 
the magnetic couplings between its primary and secondary windings. It is generally used in circuits that 
solve vector problems, such as analog computers and conversion equipment. The resolver solves three 
different type problems: (1) Resolution - separating a vector into two mutually perpendicular 
components; (2) Composition - combining two components of a vector to produce a vector sum; and (3) 
Combination - the process of resolution and composition taking place simultaneously [15].
