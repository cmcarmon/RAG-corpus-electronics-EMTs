HMM Structure and Formulation
The HMM as an Automaton
An HMM can be viewed as a stochastic ﬁnite-state automa-
ton—a type of abstract ‘‘machine’’ used to model the gener-
ation of a sequence of events or observations (Hopcroft and
Ullman, 1979), in this case representing a speech utterance.
The utterance may be a word, a subword unit, or, in principle,
a sentence or paragraph. In small vocabulary systems, the
HMM tends to be used to model words, whereas in larger
vocabulary systems, the HMM is used for subword units like
phonemes and for more abstract
language information
(see Section 3.4.3.). To introduce the operation of the HMM,
