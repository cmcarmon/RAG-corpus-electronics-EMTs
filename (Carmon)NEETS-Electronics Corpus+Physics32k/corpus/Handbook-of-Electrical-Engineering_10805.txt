Industrial ecology has an important implication, however, of special interest to electronics and telecommu-
nications  engineers,  and  thus  deserving  of  emphasis.  The  achievement  of  sustainability  will,  in  part,  require
the  substitution  of  intellectual  and  information  capital  for  traditional  physical  capital,  energy,  and  material
inputs. Environmentally appropriate electronics, information management, and telecommunications technol-
ogies and services—and the manufacturing base that supports them—are therefore enabling technologies to
achieve sustainable development. This offers unique opportunities for professional satisfaction, but also places
a unique responsibility on the community of electrical and electronics engineers. We in particular cannot simply
wait for the theory of industrial ecology to be fully developed before taking action.
