For maximum safety, most meggers are equipped with hand-crank generators for producing
the high DC voltage (up to 1000 volts). If the operator of the meter receives a shock from the
high voltage, the condition will be self-correcting, as he or she will naturally stop cranking
the generator! Sometimes a ”slip clutch” is used to stabilize generator speed under different
cranking conditions, so as to provide a fairly stable voltage whether it is cranked fast or slow.
Multiple voltage output levels from the generator are available by the setting of a selector
switch.
