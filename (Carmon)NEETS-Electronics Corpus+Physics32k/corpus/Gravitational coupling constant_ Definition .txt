αG is typically defined in terms of the gravitational attraction between two electrons. More precisely,

{\displaystyle \alpha _{\mathrm {G} }={\frac {Gm_{\mathrm {e} }^{2}}{\hbar c}}=\left({\frac {m_{\mathrm {e} }}{m_{\mathrm {P} }}}\right)^{2}\approx 1.7518\times 10^{-45}}

where:
G is the gravitational constant;
me is the electron rest mass;
c is the speed of light in vacuum;
ħ is the reduced Planck constant;
mP is the Planck mass.
In Planck units, where G = c = ħ = 4πε0 = 1, the expression becomes the square of the electron mass

This shows that the gravitational coupling constant can be thought of as the analogue of the fine-structure constant (also expressed in Planck unit):

While the fine-structure constant measures the electrostatic repulsion between two particles with equal charge, the magnitude of which is equal to the square of the elementary charge, this gravitational coupling constant measures the gravitational attraction between two electrons. This is one manner of expressing that "Gravity is a far weaker force than the electromagnetic interaction" since αG is 42 orders of magnitude smaller than α.
