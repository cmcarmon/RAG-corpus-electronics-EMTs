Fresnel number – wavenumber over distance
Reynolds number is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow, incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow. It is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes.
Mach number – ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid.

Beta (plasma physics) - ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, used in magnetospheric physics as well as fusion plasma physics.
