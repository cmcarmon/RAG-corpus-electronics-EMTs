OR gates (Fig. 10.12) 
 
OR  gates  will  produce  a  logic  1  output  whenever 
any one, or more, inputs are at logic 1. Putting this 
another way, an OR gate will only produce a logic 
0
inputs  are 
simultaneously at logic 0. The Boolean expression 
for the output, Y, of an OR gate with inputs, A and 
B, is:  
Y
