Burst  noise  is  also  called  popcorn  noise:  audio  ampliÔ¨Åers  sound  like  popcorn  popping  in  a  frying  pan
background (thermal noise). Its characteristic is 1/f n (usually n = 2), so its power density falls off rapidly, where
f is frequency. It may be problematic at low frequencies. The cause is manufacturing defects in the junction of
transistors (usually a metallic impurity).
