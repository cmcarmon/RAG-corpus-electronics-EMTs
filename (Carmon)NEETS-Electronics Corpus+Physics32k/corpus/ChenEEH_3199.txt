A nonceramic and composite insulator’s performance
under polluted conditions merits careful consideration. For
porcelain or glass insulators, ﬂashover resulting in a temporary
outage is the end result of a contamination event. This does
not usually cause any major permanent damage to the
insulator string although burning of the glaze and/or fragmen-
tation of the bells in contact with the power-follow fault
current can occur. There is little risk of the insulator failing
mechanically. It is also unlikely that the inorganic dielectric is
degraded due to surface discharge activity, which could be
long-lasting.
