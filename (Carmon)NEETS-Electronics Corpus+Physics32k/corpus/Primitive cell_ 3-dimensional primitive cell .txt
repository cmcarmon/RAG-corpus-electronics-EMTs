A crystal can be categorized by its lattice and the atoms that lie in a primitive cell (the basis). A cell will fill all the lattice space without leaving gaps by repetition of crystal translation operations.
A 3-dimensional primitive cell is a parallelepiped, which in special cases may have orthogonal angles, or equal lengths, or both.
