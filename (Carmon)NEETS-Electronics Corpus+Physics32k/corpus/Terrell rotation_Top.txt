Terrell rotation or Terrell effect is the name of a mathematical and physical effect. Specifically, Terrell rotation is the visual distortion that a passing object would appear to undergo, according to the special theory of relativity if it were travelling a significant fraction of the speed of light. This behaviour was described independently by both James Terrell and Roger Penrose in pieces published in 1959, though the general phenomenon was noted already in 1924 by Austrian physicist Anton Lampa.
Due to an early dispute about priority and correct attribution, the effect is also sometimes referred to as the Penrose–Terrell effect, the Terrell–Penrose effect or the Lampa–Terrell–Penrose effect, but not the Lampa effect.
