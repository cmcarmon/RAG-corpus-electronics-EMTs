Some insight into the expansion can be obtained from a Newtonian expansion model which leads to a simplified version of the Friedman equation. It relates the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance which is constant) between a pair of objects, e.g. two galaxy clusters, moving with the Hubble flow in an expanding or contracting FLRW universe at any arbitrary time



t


{\displaystyle t}
to their distance at some reference time




t

0




{\displaystyle t_{0}}
. The formula for this is:




d
(
t
)
=
a
(
t
)

d

0


,



{\displaystyle d(t)=a(t)d_{0},\,}

where



d
(
t
)


{\displaystyle d(t)}
is the proper distance at epoch



t


{\displaystyle t}
,




d

0




{\displaystyle d_{0}}
is the distance at the reference time




t

0




{\displaystyle t_{0}}
and



a
(
t
)


{\displaystyle a(t)}
is the scale factor. Thus, by definition,



a
(

t

0


)
=
1


{\displaystyle a(t_{0})=1}
.
The scale factor is dimensionless, with



t


{\displaystyle t}
counted from the birth of the universe and




t

0




{\displaystyle t_{0}}
set to the present age of the universe:



13.799
±
0.021


G
y
r



{\displaystyle 13.799\pm 0.021\,\mathrm {Gyr} }
giving the current value of



a


{\displaystyle a}
as



a
(

t

0


)


{\displaystyle a(t_{0})}
or



1


{\displaystyle 1}
.
The evolution of the scale factor is a dynamical question, determined by the equations of general relativity, which are presented in the case of a locally isotropic, locally homogeneous universe by the Friedmann equations.
The Hubble parameter is defined:




H
≡






a
˙



(
t
)


a
(
t
)





{\displaystyle H\equiv {{\dot {a}}(t) \over a(t)}}

where the dot represents a time derivative. From the previous equation



d
(
t
)
=

d

0


a
(
t
)


{\displaystyle d(t)=d_{0}a(t)}
one can see that






d
˙



(
t
)
=

d

0





a
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {d}}(t)=d_{0}{\dot {a}}(t)}
, and also that




d

0


=



d
(
t
)


a
(
t
)





{\displaystyle d_{0}={\frac {d(t)}{a(t)}}}
, so combining these gives






d
˙



(
t
)
=



d
(
t
)



a
˙



(
t
)


a
(
t
)





{\displaystyle {\dot {d}}(t)={\frac {d(t){\dot {a}}(t)}{a(t)}}}
, and substituting the above definition of the Hubble parameter gives






d
˙



(
t
)
=
H
d
(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {d}}(t)=Hd(t)}
which is just Hubble's law.
Current evidence suggests that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating, which means that the second derivative of the scale factor






a
¨



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\ddot {a}}(t)}
is positive, or equivalently that the first derivative






a
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {a}}(t)}
is increasing over time. This also implies that any given galaxy recedes from us with increasing speed over time, i.e. for that galaxy






d
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {d}}(t)}
is increasing with time. In contrast, the Hubble parameter seems to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance d and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.
According to the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric which is used to model the expanding universe, if at the present time we receive light from a distant object with a redshift of z, then the scale factor at the time the object originally emitted that light is



a
(
t
)
=

z





{\displaystyle a(t)={\frac {1}{1+z}}}
