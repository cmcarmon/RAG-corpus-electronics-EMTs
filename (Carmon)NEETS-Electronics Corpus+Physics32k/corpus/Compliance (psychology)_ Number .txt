Researches have found that compliance increases as the number of people in the group increases; however, once the group reaches 4 or 5 people, compliance is less likely to occur. After this point, each additional person has less of an influencing effect. However, adding more members to a small group (i.e., 3 to 4 people) has a greater effect than adding more members to a larger group (i.e., 53 to 54 people) (Aronson).
