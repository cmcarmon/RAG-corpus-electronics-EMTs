Resistance is measured in ohms, a unit named 
for the German physicist and mathematician George 
Simon Ohm (1787–1854). In 1827, Ohm published 
a paper acknowledging the mathematical relation-
ship among current, voltage, and resistance known as 
Ohm’s law. The symbol for the ohm is the Greek letter 
omega (Ω).
