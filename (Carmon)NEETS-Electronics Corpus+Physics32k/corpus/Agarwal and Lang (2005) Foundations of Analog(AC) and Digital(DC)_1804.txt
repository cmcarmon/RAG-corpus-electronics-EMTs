Since Q = 5, we also know that the system will ring for approximately 5 cycles.
To complete the picture, we must now combine the boundary values
shown in Figure 12.56a with a sinusoid of frequency 1584 Hz (or cycle time 0.6
ms) that decays over about 5 cycles. To do so, it helps to determine the initial
trajectory of the capacitor voltage (increasing or decreasing) starting from its
initial value of 0.5 V. It turns out that we can obtain this information by looking
at the initial state on the other memory element, namely the inductor. The
initial inductor current is given as âˆ’0.5 A. In the absence of a driving impulse,
since the magnitude of this current cannot change instantaneously, and since
the given direction of the initial current tends to discharge the capacitor, we can
conclude that the capacitor voltage will tend to decrease. This decreasing initial
trajectory of the capacitor voltage is illustrated in Figure 12.56b.
