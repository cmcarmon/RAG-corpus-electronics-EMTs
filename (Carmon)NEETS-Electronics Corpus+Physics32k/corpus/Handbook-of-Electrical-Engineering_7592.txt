All  CMOS  inputs  are  diode  protected  to  prevent  static  charge
from accumulating on the FET gates and causing punch-through of
the  oxide  insulating  layer.  A  typical  conﬁguration  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 79.14. Diodes D1 and D2 clamp the transistor gates between VDD
and VSS. Care must be taken to avoid input voltages that would cause
excessive diode currents. For this reason manufacturers specify an
input  voltage  constraint  from  VSS  –  0.5  V  to  VDD  +  0.5  V.  The
resistance Rs helps protect the diodes from excessive currents but is
introduced at the expense of switching speed, which is deteriorated
by the time constant of this resistance and the junction capacitances.
Advanced  versions  of  CMOS  have  been  developed  which  are
faster than standard CMOS. The ﬁrst of these to appear were des-
ignated  74HCxx  and  74HCTxx.  The  supply  voltage  range  for  this
series is limited to 2 V £ VDD – VSS £ 6 V. The pin numbering of a
given chip is the same as its correspondingly numbered TTL device.
Furthermore, gates with the HCT code have skewed transfer char-
acteristics which match those of its TTL cousin, so that these chips
can be directly interchanged with low-power Schottky TTL.
