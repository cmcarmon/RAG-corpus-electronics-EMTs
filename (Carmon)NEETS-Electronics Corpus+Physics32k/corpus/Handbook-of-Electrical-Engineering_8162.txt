Such tubes are, as of 1996, still in the development stage.
Another type of ﬂat panel using an electron beam is the ﬁeld emission device (FED); these FEDs are in fact
using electron beams generated in a very high vacuum by ﬁeld emission, then these beams are modulated and
addressed  by  sets  of  matrixed  conductive  electrodes,  arranged  in  rows  and  columns,  and  impinged  on  a
ﬂuorescent screen [Kumar et al., 1994]. These FEDs are in the early stages of development and samples of 10-in.
diagonal color panels have been demonstrated in 1996, during the SID conference.
