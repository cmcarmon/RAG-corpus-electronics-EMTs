The term in electricity that is the opposite of resistance 
is conductance	(G). Conductance is the ability of a 
material to pass electrons. The unit of conductance 
is a mho, ohm spelled backwards. The symbol used 
to represent conductance is the inverted Greek letter 
omega (V). Conductance is the reciprocal of resisâ€‘
tance and is measured in siemens	(s). A reciprocal is 
obtained by dividing the number into 1.
