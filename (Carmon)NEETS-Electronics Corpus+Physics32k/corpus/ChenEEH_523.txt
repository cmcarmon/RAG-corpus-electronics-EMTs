The mn and mp are called the electron and hole mobilities,
respectively. (The direction of vp coincides with the direction
of the electric ﬁeld, and the direction of vn is opposite to the
direction of the electric ﬁeld, since holes are positively charged
and electrons are negatively charged.) The total charge of the
electrons crossing a unit area of a semiconductor per second is
qnvn, where n is the electron concentration in the conduction
