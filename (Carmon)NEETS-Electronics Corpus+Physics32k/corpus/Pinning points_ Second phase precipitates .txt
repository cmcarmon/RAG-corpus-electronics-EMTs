The precipitation of a second phase within the lattice of a material creates physical blockades through which a dislocation cannot pass. The result is that the dislocation must bend (which requires greater energy, or a greater stress to be applied) around the precipitates, which inevitably leaves residual dislocation loops encircling the second phase material and shortens the original dislocation.
