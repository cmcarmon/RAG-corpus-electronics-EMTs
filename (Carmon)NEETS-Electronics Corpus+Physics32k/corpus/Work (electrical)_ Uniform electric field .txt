Where the electric field is constant (i.e. not a function of displacement, r), the work equation simplifies to:




W
=
Q
(

E

⋅


r

)
=


F

E



⋅


r



{\displaystyle W=Q(\mathbf {E} \cdot \,\mathbf {r} )=\mathbf {F_{E}} \cdot \,\mathbf {r} }

or 'force times distance' (times the cosine of the angle between them).
