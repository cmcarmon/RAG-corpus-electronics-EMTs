or  RAM)  or  it  can  be  considered  to  be  associated 
with input/output (I/O). 
  Since  the  data  bus  is  connected  to  a  number  of 
VLSI  devices,  an  essential  requirement  of  such 
chips (e.g., ROM or RAM) is that their data outputs 
should  be  capable  of  being  isolated  from  the  bus 
whenever  necessary.  These  chips  are  fitted  with 
select  or  enable  inputs  that  are  driven  by  address 
decoding logic (not shown in Fig. 11.2). This logic 
ensures  that  ROM,  RAM  and  I/O  devices  never 
simultaneously attempt to place data on the bus!
