When energy is applied to the slot antenna, currents flow in the metal sheet. These currents are not 
confined to the edges of the slot but rather spread out over the sheet. Radiation then takes place from both 
sides of the sheet. In the case of the complementary dipole, however, the currents are more confined; so a 
much greater magnitude of current is required to produce a given power output using the dipole antenna.
