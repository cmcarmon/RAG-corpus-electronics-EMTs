The Barbadian school year is fashioned after the British system, and as such, it follows a scheduling with three terms per school year.
First term begins in the second week of September and continues for 15 weeks, ending in mid-December, excluding one week for mid-term break in mid-October.
Second term begins in the first week of January and continues for 12 weeks, ending at the end of March.
Third term begins mid-April and continues for 11 weeks until the end of June.
The long school holiday period is 9 to 10 weeks from the end of June until the first week of September.
