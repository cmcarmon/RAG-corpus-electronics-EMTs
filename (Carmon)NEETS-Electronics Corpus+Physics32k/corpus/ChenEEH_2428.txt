The scattered ﬁeld EEs(r, u, f; ui, fi) in the far-ﬁeld region can
be decomposed into two parts. The ﬁrst part, EEso(r, u, f;
ui, fi),
is the scattering with the antenna input terminals
open-circuited (IL ¼ 0). The second part, EEr (r, u, f; ui, fi), is
the reradiated ﬁeld due to the load current IL ¼ -Iin when the
antenna is loaded with a ﬁnite impedance:
