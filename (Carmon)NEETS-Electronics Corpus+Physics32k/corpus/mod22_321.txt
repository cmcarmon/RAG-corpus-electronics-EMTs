The number of instructions in a computer's instruction set may range from less than 30 to more than 
100. These instructions may be classified into categories by the action they perform such as input/output 
(I/O), data movement, arithmetic, logic, and transfer of control. Input/output instructions are used to 
communicate between I/O devices and the central processor. Data movement instructions are used for 
copying data from one storage location to another and for rearranging and changing of data elements in 
some prescribed manner.
