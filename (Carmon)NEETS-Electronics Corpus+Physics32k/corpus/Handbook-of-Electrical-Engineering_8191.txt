1. The electrical characteristics of the gas discharge allow plasma displays to be made with diagonals in the
20- to 60-in. range. Such large diagonals are facilitated by very strong non-linearity and inherent memory
of  the  discharge,  as  discussed  in  Items  3  and  4  below,  which  present  no  practical  limitations  to  the
number of lines that can be multiplexed. Also, the high impedance characteristic (covered below in Item
11) coupled with the ability to use highly conductive opaque electrodes, greatly reduces electrode loss
limitations to size. Monochrome plasma displays have been sold with sizes as great as 60-in. diagonal,
