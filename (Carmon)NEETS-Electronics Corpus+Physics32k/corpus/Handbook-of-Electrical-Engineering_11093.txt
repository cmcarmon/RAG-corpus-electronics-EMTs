are very much higher than the average amplitude of the electric ﬁelds produced in tissue by PEMF devices and
also higher than the instantaneous peak values produced by some of the PEMF systems. It is interesting to note
here that in vitro experiments with truly capacitively coupled ﬁelds showed enhancement of bone cell prolif-
eration at very much lower amplitude (10–5 V/m) when the frequency of the continuous sine wave was 10 Hz
rather than 60 kHz [Fitzsimmons et al., 1986]. The most recent addition to FDA approved non-invasive systems
(H in Table 113.2) employs a sinusoidally time varying 76.6 Hz, 40 mT ﬁeld superimposed on a DC ﬁeld of 20
mT.  Possible  reasons  for  using  this  AC/DC  “resonance”  combination  are  discussed  in  the  Mechanisms  and
Dosimetry section.
