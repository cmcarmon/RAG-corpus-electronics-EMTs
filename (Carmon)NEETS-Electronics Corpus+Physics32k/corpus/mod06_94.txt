Edisonâ€™s plate was just that-a plate, a flat piece of metal. Plates are no longer flat but are designed in
many different shapes. Figure 1-8 shows two diodes, one with a directly heated cathode, the other with an
indirectly heated cathode. Each plate is cut away to show the internal position of elements and the plate
shapes.
