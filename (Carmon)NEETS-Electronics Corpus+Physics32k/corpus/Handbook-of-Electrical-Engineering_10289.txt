Avionics Standards
Standards play an important role in avionics. Military avionics are controlled by the various standards (MIL-
STDs,  DOD-STDs,  etc.)  for  packaging,  environmental  performance,  operating  characteristics,  electrical  and
data interfaces, and other design-related parameters. General aviation avionics are governed by fewer and less
stringent standards. Technical Standard Orders (TSOs) released by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
are  used  as  guidelines  to  ensure  airworthiness  of  the  avionics.  TSOs  are  derived  from  and,  in  most  cases,
reference  RTCA  documents  characterized  as  Minimum  Operational  Performance  Standards  and  Minimum
Avionics System Performance Standards. EUROCAE is the European counterpart of RTCA.
