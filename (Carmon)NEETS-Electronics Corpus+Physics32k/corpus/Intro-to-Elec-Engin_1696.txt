Figure 16.5.1 shows a block diagram for microcomputer-based control of a physical process, such
as a chemical plant. A slight variation of the system can be used for automotive instrumentation
in which sensors furnish various signals for speed, fuel reserve, battery voltage, oil pressure,
engine temperature, and so on. The data are presented to the driver in one or more displays on
the dashboard. In a physical process on the other hand, based on the display information, an
operator can assess and direct the operation of the control process through a keyboard or other
input devices to the microcomputer.
