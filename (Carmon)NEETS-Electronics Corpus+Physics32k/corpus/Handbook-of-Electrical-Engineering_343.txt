The third line is obtained by breaking up the exponential in the previous line by the law of exponents. The
ﬁrst factor between square brackets in this line is identiﬁed as the phasor voltage and the second factor as the
conjugate of the phasor current. The last line then follows. It expresses the average power in terms of the voltage
and current phasors and is sometimes more convenient to use.
