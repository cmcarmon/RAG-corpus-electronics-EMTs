A desoldering braid consists of a braided cop-
per material with flux imbedded in it that uses capil-
lary action to pull up the hot solder (Figure 49-20). 
Using the widest braid practical, place it on the pad to 
be desoldered. Place a hot soldering iron on top of the 
braid. The solder will melt and be wicked into the braid. 
When the braid gets saturated, remove it, clip off the 
saturation end with diagonal cutters, and reapply until 
the solder is removed. Use a hot soldering ironâ€”the 
braid acts like a heat sink, cooling the soldering iron tip.
The desoldering bulb uses a bulb and a Teflon 
tip. Squeeze the bulb and apply the tip to the melted 
solder; releasing the bulb draws up the molten solder 
(Figure 49-21).
