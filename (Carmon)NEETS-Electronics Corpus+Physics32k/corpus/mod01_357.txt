With the birth of the space program and the development of small transceivers and miniaturized 
equipment, a power source of small size was needed. Such equipment requires a small cell which is 
capable of delivering maximum electrical energy at a constant discharge voltage. The mercury cell, which 
is one of the smallest cells, meets these requirements.
