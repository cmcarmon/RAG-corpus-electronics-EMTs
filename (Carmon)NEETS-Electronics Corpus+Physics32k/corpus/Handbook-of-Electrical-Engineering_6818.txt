General Considerations • Detection of Known Signals • Detection of 
Parametrized Signals • Detection of Random Signals • Deciding 
Among Multiple Signals • Detection of Signals in More General Noise 
Processes • Robust and Nonparametric Detection • Distributed and 
Sequential Detection • Detection with Continuous-Time 
Measurements
