The method of synthesizing a smart/intelligent system is illustrated in Fig. 58.3. The output response under a
given set of input condition(s) of a parent test system is normally decided by the properties of the constituent
(conventional)  materials.  If  the  system-states  (changes)  under  the  inï¬‚uence  of  external  inputs  are  sensed,
however, an appropriate feedback control can be used to actuate an imbedded smart material in the parent unit,
so that output will track adaptively a desired response. The feedback path may include relevant electronic hardware
(such as microprocessors) for on-line processing of the feedback signal to optimize the system performance.
