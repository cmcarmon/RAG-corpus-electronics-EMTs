Activities of the bits in an LNS-encoded word are quantiﬁed
under similar assumptions. Since there is an one-to-one cor-
respondence of linear ﬁxed-point values to their LNS images
deﬁned by equation 1.1, the LNS values follow a probability
function identical to the ﬁxed-point case. In fact, the LNS
