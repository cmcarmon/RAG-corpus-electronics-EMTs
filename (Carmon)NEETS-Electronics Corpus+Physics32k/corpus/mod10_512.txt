In waveform (4), the incident wave is at a maximum negative value at the end of the line. The wave
has moved another 45 degrees to the right from the wave in the preceding illustration. The reflected wave
has also moved 45 degrees, but to the left. The reflected wave is in phase with the incident wave. The
resultant of these two waves, shown by the dark line, again has a negative maximum at the end of the line
