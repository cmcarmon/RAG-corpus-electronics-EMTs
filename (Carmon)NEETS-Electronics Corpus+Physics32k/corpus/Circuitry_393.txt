7.12   The  following  RMS  voltage  measurements 
 
were made during a signal test on the simple 
power  amplifier  shown  in  Fig.  7.56  when  
 
connected to a 15 P load: 
 
 
Vin = 50 mV   
Vout = 2 V 
Determine: 
(a) the voltage gain 
(b) the output power 
(c) the output current. 
If  the  power  amplifier  shown  in  Fig.  7.56 
produces a maximum RMS output power of 
0.25  W,  determine  its  overall  efficiency  if 
the supply current is 75 mA. Also determine 
the  power  dissipated  in  each  of  the  output 
transistors in this condition.
