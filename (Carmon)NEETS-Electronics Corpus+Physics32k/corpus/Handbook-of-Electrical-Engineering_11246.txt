The electrocardiogram (ECG) is the recording on the body surface of the electrical activity generated by the
heart. It was originally observed by Waller in 1889 using his pet bulldog as the signal source and the capillary
electrometer  as  the  recording  device.  In  1903  Einthoven  enhanced  the  technology  by  using  the  string  galva-
nometer as the recording device and using human subjects with a variety of cardiac abnormalities. Einthoven
is  chieﬂy  responsible  for  introducing  some  concepts  still  in  use  today  including  the  labeling  of  the  various
waves, deﬁning some of the standard recording sites using the arms and legs, and developing the ﬁrst theoretical
construct whereby the heart is modeled as a single time varying dipole. We also owe the “EKG” acronym to
Einthoven’s native Dutch language where the root word “cardio” is spelled with a “k”.
