The energy band diagram of an ideal p-type substrate MOS
capacitor at zero bias is shown in Figure 3.2. In an ideal MOS
capacitor, the metal work function, fm, is equal to the semi-
conductor work function, fs. Therefore, when the Fermi level
of the semiconductor, EFS, is aligned with the Fermi level of the
gate, EFm, there is no band bending in any region of the MOS
capacitor. Furthermore, the gate dielectric is assumed to be free
of any charges, and the semiconductor is uniformly doped.
