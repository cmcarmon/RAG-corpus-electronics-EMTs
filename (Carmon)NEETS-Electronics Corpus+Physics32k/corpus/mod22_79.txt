Manufacturers of third generation computers are producing a series of similar and compatible 
computers. This allows programs written for one computer model to run on most larger models of the 
same series. Most third generation systems are designed to handle both scientific and business data 
processing applications. Improved program and operating software has been designed to provide better 
control, resulting in faster processing. These enhancements are of significant importance to the computer 
operator. They simplify system initialization (booting) and minimize the need for inputs to the program 
from a keyboard (console intervention) by the operator.
