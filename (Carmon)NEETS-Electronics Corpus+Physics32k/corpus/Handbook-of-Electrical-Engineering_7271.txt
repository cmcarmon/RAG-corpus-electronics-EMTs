Properties Right for Both Microcell Coverage and Conﬁnement
The ﬁrst major advantage of the 18-GHz band is its excellent propagation characteristics for a microcellular
network. Indeed, the behavior and properties of these higher frequencies that are disadvantages for traditional
long-range broadcast applications become critical advantages for wireless microcellular network applications.
Propagation  characteristics  of  18-GHz  radio  waves  make  them  well  suited  to  diffuse  thoroughly  through  a
network microcell using only a minimum of transmitted power, yet still stay conﬁned within it so that the same
frequencies can be reused by another system within as little as 120 feet or so, or even on the other side of a
dense, continuous barrier such as a cement ﬂoor. Typical microcells might encompass, for example, a level or
ﬂoor, or portions of a ﬂoor, in a standard ofﬁce building.
