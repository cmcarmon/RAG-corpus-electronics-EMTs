Because of their construction, IC synchros are sometimes called reversed synchros. The primary
winding, consisting of two series-connected coils, is mounted physically on the stator. The secondary,
consisting of three Y-connected coils, is mounted physically on the rotor.  This is shown schematically in
figure 4-1.
