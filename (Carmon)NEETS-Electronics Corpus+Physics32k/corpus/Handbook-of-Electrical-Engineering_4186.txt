open-circuited  (four  different  cases),  and  voltages  were  measured  simultaneously  at  each  end.  Figures  40.26
and 40.27 contain speciﬁc examples of measured and calculated voltage waveforms at each line end as well as
the  measured  vertical  electric  ﬁeld  and  calculated  horizontal  electric  ﬁeld  via  Eq.  (40.7).  It  is  clear  from
Figs. 40.25  through  40.27  that  the  induced  voltage  polarities  and  waveshapes  are  strongly  dependent  on  the
angle to the lightning and on the line end terminations. It is apparent also from Georgiadis et al. [1992] that
while  measured  and  calculated  voltage  waveshapes  are  in  good  agreement,  the  measured  voltage  amplitudes
are, on average, a factor of three smaller than calculated voltages. This amplitude discrepancy remains unex-
plained but is probably due to the fact that the ﬁelds reaching the power line were shielded by trees along the
line whereas the ﬁelds measured were in an open area and hence were unshielded.
