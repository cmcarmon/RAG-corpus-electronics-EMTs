where vCPeak and iLPeak are the peak values of vC and iL, respectively. Thus, the
L/C, which has the units of resistance, originates from energy consider-

ations and is the ratio of the peak values of the two states. The ratio
called the characteristic impedance. In the following section, we will see that the
L/C also helps characterize the dynamics of damped second-order
parameter
circuits.
