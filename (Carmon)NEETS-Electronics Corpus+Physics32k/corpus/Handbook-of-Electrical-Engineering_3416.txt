m
s. The higher speed
performance  of  these  devices  is  achieved  by  using  the  successive  approximation  technique,  modiﬁed  ﬂash
techniques,  and  statistically  derived  A/D  conversion  techniques.  Applications  appropriate  for  these  A/D  ICs
include  fast  Fourier  transform  (FFT)  analysis,  radar  digitization,  medical  instrumentation,  and  multiplexed
data acquisition. Some ICs have been manufactured with an extremely high degree of linearity, to be appropriate
for specialized applications in digital spectrum analysis, vibration analysis, geological research, sonar digitizing,
and medical imaging.
