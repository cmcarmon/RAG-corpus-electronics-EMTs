PERCENT OF MODULATION IN AN AM WAVE.â€”The degree of modulation is defined in 
terms of the maximum permissible amount of modulation. Thus, a fully modulated wave is said to be 
100-PERCENT MODULATED. The modulation envelope in figure 1-40, view (A), shows the conditions 
for 100-percent sine-wave modulation. For this degree of modulation, the peak audio voltage must be 
equal to the dc supply voltage to the final power amplifier. Under these conditions, the rf output voltage 
will reach 0 on the negative peak of the modulating signal; on the positive peak, it will rise to twice the 
amplitude of the unmodulated carrier.
