As indicated in the block diagram shown in views A and B of figure 3-40, the lead differences are 
even more pronounced. Unlike the transistor, the UJT has only one PN junction. The area between base 1 
and base 2 acts as a resistor when the UJT is properly biased. A conventional transistor needs a certain 
bias level between the emitter, base, and collector for proper conduction. The same principle is true for 
the UJT; it needs a certain bias level between the emitter and base 1 and also between base 1 and base 2 
for proper conduction.
