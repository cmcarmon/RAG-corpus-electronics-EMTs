The straight-line plot of current over voltage indicates that resistance is a stable, unchang-
ing value for a wide range of circuit voltages and currents. In an ”ideal” situation, this is the
case. Resistors, which are manufactured to provide a deﬁnite, stable value of resistance, be-
have very much like the plot of values seen above. A mathematician would call their behavior
”linear.”
