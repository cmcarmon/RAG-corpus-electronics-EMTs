The problem can be eliminated by isolating the dc and radio frequency circuits from each other. In
planar tubes, this is fairly simple. The point A ring is grounded. Any rf signals that the cathode may pick
up through tube conduction are grounded or shorted to ground through the capacitive coupling with the
point A shell. In other words, the point A shell (capacitive ground) serves the same function as the bypass
