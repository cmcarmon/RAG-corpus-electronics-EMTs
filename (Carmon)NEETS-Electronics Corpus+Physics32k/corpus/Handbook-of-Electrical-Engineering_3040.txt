Realization of the complete ﬁfth-order Chebyshev VTF requires the design of another second-order section
to deal with the second quadratic term in Eq. (29.5), together with a simple circuit to realize the ﬁrst-order
term arising because this is an odd-order VTF. Figure 29.6 shows the form of the overall cascade. Note that the
op amps at the output of each stage provide the necessary interstage isolation. It is ﬁnally worth noting that
an extended single-ampliﬁer form of the Sallen and Key network exists—the circuit shown in Fig. 29.2 is an
example of this—but that the saving in op amps is paid for by higher component spreads, sensitivities, and
design complexity.
