This is a reliable, rugged, and inexpensive semiconductor display device requiring about 10 mA
of current ï¬‚ow for full illumination. An LED is shown in Figure 6.2.17. It is available in red,
yellow, or green color, in common sizes of T-1 and T-1 3/4, where the number after the T denotes
the diameter of the lamp in units of eighths of an inch. Two-color LEDs are also available.
