Transmission cables use a hermetic seal over the core to
protect it from water exposure. Extruded lead, extruded- or
seam-welded aluminum, or seam-welded copper sheath pro-
vides both the hermetic barrier and path for short circuit
currents. Due to the presence of a good seal, problems such
as water treeing widely experienced with distribution XLPE
cables has not been an issue with transmission cables. Pre-
sently, extruded XLPE cables are being designed for operation
at 500 kV. The use of thermoplastic-type low-density poly-
ethylene (LDPE) is widespread in France on 225 kV cables.
These cables have been in service since 1969. In 1985, the
voltage of the LDPE cables was extended to 400 kV and subse-
quently to 500 kV in 1995.
