. A monitor/display is a video display terminal. It is the
most basic output device in a typical computer system.
Sometimes this can be an input device if it is modiﬁed
into a touch screen monitor. Two other common displays
are cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display
(LCD). Other rate technologies are light emitting diode
(LED), gas plasma, and other image projection tech-
niques. Most displays use analog signals, thus, they need
the video adapter to store them in VRAM, then convert
the digital signals to analog signals through DAC. Now-
adays, a terminal can display up to 16,777,216 colors or
24-bit long colors. Human beings cannot differentiate
this much color, but since it is convenient for program-
mers to program it in RGB, 1 byte each, it is widely used.
For example, colors in HTML are usually expressed in
#03F60A using RGB. The sharpness of the display is
determined using dots-per-inch (dpi). This depends on
the resolution and physical screen size. The screen size’s
ratio of width to height (aspect ratio) is usually 4:3.
