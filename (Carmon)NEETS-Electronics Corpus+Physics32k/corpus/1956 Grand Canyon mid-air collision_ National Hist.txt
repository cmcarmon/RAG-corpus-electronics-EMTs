On April 22, 2014, the site of the crash was declared a National Historic Landmark, making it the first landmark for an event that happened in the air. The exact location of the crash site is being kept secret, having been redacted from the officially released nomination form. Furthermore, the location has been closed to the public since the 1950s. Even if the location were revealed, it is in a remote portion of the canyon and accessible only to experienced hikers.
