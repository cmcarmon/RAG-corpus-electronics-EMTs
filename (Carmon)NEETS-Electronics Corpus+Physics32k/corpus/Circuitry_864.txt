secured  by  means  of  four  or  more  screws. 
 
Boxes are available in a range of sizes and the 
 
diecast  types  (which  are  ideal  for  use  in 
 
relatively  hostile  environments)  are  available 
 
 
both unpainted and with a textured paint finish. 
(c)  Rack  systems.  These  are  designed  to  accept 
standard  cards  and  are  ideal  for  modular 
 
projects.  The  outer  case  comprises  an 
 
aluminium framework fitted with covers and a 
 
 
series of connectors at the rear from which the 
  modules  derive  their  power  and  exchange 
signals. Individual circuit cards (which may be 
 
stripboard  or  PCB)  are  fitted  to  a  small 
 
supporting  chassis  and  anodized  aluminium 
 
 
front  panel  (available  in  various  widths).  The 
card  assembly  slides 
 
the  rack  using 
appropriately  positioned  clip-in  guides.  Rack 
 
 
systems are expensive but inherently flexible. 
(d)  Desk  consoles.  These  enclosures  are  ideal  for 
desktop equipment and generally have sloping 
 
surfaces that are ideal for mounting key-boards 
 
 
and keypads. 
(e)  Special  purpose  enclosures.  Apart  from  the 
general-purpose  types  of  enclosure  described 
 
earlier, a variety of special purpose enclosures 
 
are also available. These include such items as 
 
 
clock  and  calculator  housings,  enclosures  for 
 
hand-held  controllers,  and  cases  for  in-line 
  mains  power  supplies  (including  types  having 
 
 
Having  decided  upon  which  of  the  basic  types  of 
enclosure  is  required,  the  following  questions 
should  be  borne  in  mind  when  making  a  final 
selection of enclosure: 
 
(cid:127)
(cid:127) Will the enclosure accommodate the stripboard 
or  PCB  circuitry  together  with  the  ‘off-board’ 
components  (including,  where  appropriate,  the 
mains transformer)?
