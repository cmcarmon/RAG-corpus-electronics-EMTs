1. Testing logic that is downstream from the RAM block (i.e., output of RAM block drives the downstream
logic) is difÔ¨Åcult since this requires setting the test pattern at the RAM outputs. This problem is usually
solved by providing a bypass mode where data inputs to the RAM (or ROM) block are channeled directly
to the RAM (or ROM) outputs without (or in addition to) being stored inside the RAM block. This way
the RAM data outputs can be controlled by controlling the data inputs as desired.
