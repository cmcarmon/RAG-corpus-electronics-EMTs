Solution:
Notice that the capacitor in Example 7.14 is located in the input loop,
while the capacitor in Example 7.15 is located in the feedback loop. In
this example, the capacitor is located in the output of the op amp. Again,
we can solve this problem directly using nodal analysis. However, using
the Thevenin equivalent circuit may simplify the problem.
