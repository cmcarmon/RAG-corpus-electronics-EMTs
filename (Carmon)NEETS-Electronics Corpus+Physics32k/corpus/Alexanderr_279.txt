A capacitor  is  a  passive  element  designed  to  store  energy  in  its  elec-
tric Ô¨Åeld. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical
components. Capacitors are used extensively in electronics, communi-
cations, computers, and power systems. For example, they are used in
the tuning circuits of radio receivers and as dynamic memory elements
in computer systems.
