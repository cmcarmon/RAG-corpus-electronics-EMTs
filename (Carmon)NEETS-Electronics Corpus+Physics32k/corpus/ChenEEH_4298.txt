The Internet is unprecedented in its impact on the world
community of
institutions, and individuals. In
some way, the Internet has touched most of our lives in
terms of how we communicate, how we promote our products,
how we teach our children, and how we invest our time. No
media adoption curve has been faster than the Internetâ€™s. In
the United States alone, it took almost 40 years for 50 million
people to use radio and 15 years for 50 million people to use
Television and cellular communications. Internet users reached
the 50-million mark in just 5 years.
