One of the more widespread uses of the computer is word processing. The word processor can be 
considered a typewriter with a display screen. To the hundreds of thousands of word processor users, the 
computer is nothing more than a typewriter. Both have keyboards, and both have a mechanism for making 
the image of the character you strike on the keyboard appear on some type of visual medium. When using 
an electric typewriter, the process is strictly mechanical. When you press the key, it causes the type face 
to strike the paper, and in so doing, it leaves an impression. In the computer, the process is more indirect. 
A program stored in the computer's memory causes a visual representation to appear on a crt (cathode-ray 
tube) or at a printer. However, from the view point of the user, the result is the same, a printed document.
