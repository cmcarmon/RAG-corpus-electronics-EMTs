The MOSFET is a transistor that uses a control electrode, the gate, to capacitively modulate the conductance
of  a  surface  channel  joining  two  end  contacts,  the  source  and  the  drain.  The  gate  is  separated  from  the
semiconductor body underlying the gate by a thin gate insulator, usually silicon dioxide. The surface channel
is formed at the interface between the semiconductor body and the gate insulator (see Fig. 24.43).
