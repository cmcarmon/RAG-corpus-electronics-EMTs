The schematic symbol for a capacitor is quite simple, being little more than two short,
parallel lines (representing the plates) separated by a gap. Wires attach to the respective
plates for connection to other components. An older, obsolete schematic symbol for capacitors
showed interleaved plates, which is actually a more accurate way of representing the real
construction of most capacitors:
