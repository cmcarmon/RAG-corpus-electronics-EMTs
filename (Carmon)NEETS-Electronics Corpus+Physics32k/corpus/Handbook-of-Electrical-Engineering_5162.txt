Nickel–titanium (Nitinol) alloys of proper composition exhibit unique memory, or shape-restoration force
characteristics, and are the most popular shape-memory alloys. When the material is plastically deformed in
its low-temperature phase and then heated above its characteristic transition temperature, the original conﬁg-
uration or shape is restored. Deformations up to 6–8% can be completely restored by heating the material. It
is this property that is used in smart electromechanical actuations.
