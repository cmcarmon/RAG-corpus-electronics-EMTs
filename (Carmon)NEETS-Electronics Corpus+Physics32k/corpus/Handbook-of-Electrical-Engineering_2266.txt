An  impurity  band  in  crystalline  semiconductors  is  another  example  of  a  disordered  system.  Indeed,  the
impurity  atoms  are  randomly  distributed  within  the  host  lattice.  For  lightly  doped  semiconductors  at  room
temperature, the random potential associated with charged impurities can usually be ignored. As the doping
level  increases,  however,  a  single  energy  level  of  a  donor  or  an  acceptor  is  transformed  into  an  energy  band
with  a  width  determined  by  impurity  concentrations.  Unless  the  degree  of  compensation  is  unusually  high,
this reduces the activation energy compared to lightly doped semiconductors. The activation energy is further
reduced by the overlap of the wave functions associated with the individual donor or acceptor states.
