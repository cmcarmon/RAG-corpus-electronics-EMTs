where  K(s,s¢)  is  the  IE  kernel  function,  and  sn and  s¢m  are  the nth  and mth  locations  of  the  observation  and
source integration samples. Thus, the ﬁnal, direct-matrix coefﬁcients can be seen to be constructed from sums
of  the  more  elementary  coefﬁcients  z(i,j,m,n)  weighted  by  the  quadrature  coefﬁcients pm  and  qn  used  in  the
numerical integration, which will be the case whenever analytical expressions are not available for the Zi, j. These
elementary coefﬁcients, given by wi(sn)bj(s¢m)K(sn,s¢m), can in turn be seen to be simply products of samples of
the IE kernel or operator and sampled basis and testing functions. It should be apparent from this expanded
expression for the direct-matrix coefﬁcients that interchanging the basis and weight functions leaves the ﬁnal
problem  description  unchanged,  although  the  added  observation  that  two  different  IEs  can  yield  identical
matrices when using equivalent numerical treatments is less obvious.
