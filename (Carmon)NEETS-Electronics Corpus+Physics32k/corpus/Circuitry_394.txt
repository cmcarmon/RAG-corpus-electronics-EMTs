7.10   The  output  characteristics  of  a  junction 
 
gate  field  effect  transistor  are  shown  in 
Fig. 7.57.  If  this  JFET  is  used  in  an 
 
amplifier  circuit  operating  from  an  18V 
 
supply  with  a  gate-source  bias  voltage  of 
 
 
I3 V and  a  load  resistor  of  900  P,
determine  the  quiescent  values  of  drain-
source voltage and  drain 
current.  Also 
determine  the  peak-peak  output  voltage 
when an input voltage of 2 V peak-peak is 
applied  to  the  gate.  Also  determine  the 
voltage gain of the stage.
