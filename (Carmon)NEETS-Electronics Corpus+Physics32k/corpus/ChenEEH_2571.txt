To control the coupling mechanisms in connection with
the above cavity resonators, in particular for input/output
coupling, can become quite involved, especially if modes
other than the wanted one can resonate in the cavity as well.
The design of an appropriate coupling topology is also im-
portant in view of achieving the highest Q possible for the
wanted mode. Two modes are sometimes possible to resonate
at the same resonant frequency. These are so-called degener-
ated modes which can be used quite favorably as dual-mode
Ô¨Ålters, for example,
in very narrowband applications. The
advantage is that with only one physical cavity, two electrical
resonators can be realized.
