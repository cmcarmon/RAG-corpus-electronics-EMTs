All of the mechanisms of light-effected entrainment are not yet fully known, however numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of light entrainment to the day/night cycle. Studies have shown that:
The timing of exposure to light influences entrainment; as seen on the phase response curve for light for a given species.
In diurnal (day-active) species, exposure to light soon after wakening advances the circadian rhythm, whereas exposure before sleeping delays the rhythm. An advance means that the individual will tend to wake up earlier on the following day(s). A delay, caused by light exposure before sleeping, means that the individual will tend to wake up later on the following day(s).

The length of light exposure influences entrainment.
Longer exposures have a greater effect than shorter exposures.
Consistent light exposure has a greater effect than intermittent exposure.
In rats, constant light eventually disrupts the cycle to the point that memory and stress coping may be impaired.

The intensity and the wavelength of light influence entrainment.Dim light can affect entrainment relative to darkness.
Brighter light is more effective than dim light.
In humans, a lower intensity short wavelength (blue/violet) light appears to be equally effective as a higher intensity of white light.
