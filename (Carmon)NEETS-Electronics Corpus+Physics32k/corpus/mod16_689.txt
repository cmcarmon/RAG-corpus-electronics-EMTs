SECOND CONVERTER.â€”The second converter actually contains two converters. Only one of
these two converters in this section is ever operational, and selected as a result of the measurement band
currently being used. The selected converter will convert the frequency received from the first converter
to a usable (110 MHz) IF signal, which is then provided to the third converter.
