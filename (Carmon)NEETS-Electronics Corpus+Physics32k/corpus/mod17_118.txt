Message traffic is normally sent to the fleet by three methods: broadcast, intercept, and receipt. The 
first two are "do not answer" methods; the third, as its name implies, requires a receipt from the addressee 
(addee) for each message. Broadcast and intercept methods allow the fleet to preserve radio silence, 
which is a great advantage from the standpoint of security. By the intercept method, a shore radio station 
transmits messages to another shore station that repeats them back. Ships intercept and copy all of this 
message traffic.
