Note that if the gain sequence K (k) is known, then equations
4.27 and 4.28 are linear in P, Qd, and R. Therefore, the super-
position principle can be applied. The error budgeting proced-
ure can therefore be divided into three steps, where the second
step has several subparts. The error budgeting approach is
presented here assuming that the Kalman ﬁltering approach
is used and that the system model is known and correct.
Suboptimal ﬁltering is discussed in the next subsection.
