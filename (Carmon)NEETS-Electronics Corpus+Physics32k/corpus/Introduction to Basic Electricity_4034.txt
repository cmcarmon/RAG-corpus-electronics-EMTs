nonsinusoidal	oscillators are oscillators that do 
not produce a sine-wave output. There is no specific 
 nonsinusoidal waveshape. The nonsinusoidal oscilla-
tor output may be a square, sawtooth, rectangular, or 
triangular waveform or a combination of two wave-
forms. A common characteristic of all  nonsinusoidal 
oscillators is that they are a form of relaxation	
	oscillator. A relaxation oscillator stores energy in a 
reactive component during one phase of the oscilla-
tion cycle and gradually releases the energy during the 
relaxation phase of the cycle.
