The table also presents the expressions used to calculate directly the parameters of each set based upon their
deﬁnition as we did with z parameters. For example, consider the y, or admittance, parameters. These param-
eters are seen to be short-circuit parameters, since their evaluation requires V1 or V2 to be zero. Thus, to ﬁnd
y22  we  short-circuit  the  input  and  ﬁnd  the  admittance  looking  back  from  the  output.  For  Fig. 3.52(a), y22  =
23/88. Any parameter in Table 3.2 is found either by open-circuiting or short-circuiting a terminal and then
performing circuit analysis to ﬁnd the deﬁning ratio.
