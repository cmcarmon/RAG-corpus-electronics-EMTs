The term noise in digital VLSI systems has come to mean any
unwanted deviation in the voltages and currents at various
nodes in a circuit. When noise acts against a stable logic level
on a circuit node, it can transiently destroy logical information
carried by the node. If this ultimately causes an incorrect
