The first step is to be sure you understand the problem completelyÂ—What are the inputs and the 
outputs and what steps are needed to answer the questions? Even when you are specifying a problem of 
your own, you will find we don't usually think in small, detailed sequential steps. However, that is exactly 
how a computer operates, one step after another in a specified order. Therefore, it is necessary for you to 
think the problem solution through step by step. You might clarify the problem as shown by the Problem 
Definition in figure 3-6.
