Many excellent books cover the topic of signal processing,
such as those by Haykin and Van Veen (1999), Lathi (1998),
Mitra (1998), Oppenheim (1999, 1997), Proakis and Manola-
kis (1995) Strang and Nguyen (1996), Vaidyanathan (1993),
and Vetterli and Kovacevic (1995). Introductory articles on
new developments and research in signal processing appear
in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine. Most of the research
articles describing the advances in signal processing appear
in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, IEEE Transactions
on Image Processing, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Sys-
tems, Electronics Letters; International Conference on Acoustics,
Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), and International
Symposium on Circuits and Systems. Several information re-
sources are available on the World Wide Web. The impact
of signal processing on information technology is described
in a workshop report by the National Science Foundation
(1994).
