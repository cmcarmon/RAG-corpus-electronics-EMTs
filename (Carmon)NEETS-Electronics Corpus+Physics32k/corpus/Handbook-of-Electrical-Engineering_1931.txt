(a) A three-tap second-order nonrecursive digital ﬁlter; (b) the equivalent pipelined digital ﬁlter obtained
by placing storage units at the intersection of the signal wires and the feed-forward cutset. If the multiplication and addition
operations require 2 and 1 unit of time, respectively, then the maximum achievable sampling rates for the original and the
pipelined architectures are 1/4 and 1/2 units, respectively.
