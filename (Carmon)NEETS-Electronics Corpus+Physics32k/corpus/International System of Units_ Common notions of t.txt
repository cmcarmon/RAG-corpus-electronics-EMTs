The basic units of the metric system, as originally defined, represented common quantities or relationships in nature. They still do – the modern precisely defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology, but still with the same magnitudes. In cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available, or where approximations are good enough, the original definitions may suffice.
A second is 1/60 of a minute, which is 1/60 of an hour, which is 1/24 of a day, so a second is 1/86400 of a day; a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely fall 4.9 metres from rest.
The metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of 2 seconds; most dining tabletops are about 0.75 metre high; a very tall human (basketball forward) is about 2 metres tall.
The kilogram is the weight of a litre of cold water; a cubic centimetre or millilitre of water weighs a gram (we need not be too concerned about the difference between mass and weight); a 1-euro coin, 7.5 g; a Sacagawea US 1-dollar coin, 8.1 g; a UK 50-pence coin, 8.0 g.
A candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle, or 1 candle power; a 60 W tungsten-filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about 64 candela.
A mole of a substance has a mass that is its molecular weight expressed in units of grams; the mass of a mole of table salt is 58.4 g.
A temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree centigrade: 1/100 of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level; the absolute temperature in kelvins is the temperature in degrees Celsius plus about 273; human body temperature is about 37 °C or 310 K.
A 60 W incandescent light bulb consumes 0.5 amperes at 120 V (US mains voltage) and about 0.26 amperes at 230 V (European mains voltage).
