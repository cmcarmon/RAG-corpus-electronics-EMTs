Wound Field Synchronous Motor Drive
The speed of a wound Ô¨Åeld synchronous machine can be controlled by a current-fed converter scheme as shown
in Fig. 30.46, except that the forced-commutation elements can be removed. The machine is operated at leading
power  factor  by  overexcitation  so  that  the  inverter  can  be  load  commutated.  Because  of  the  simplicity  of
converter topology and control, such a drive is popular in the multimegawatt range.
