Magnitude of eclipse is the fraction of the angular diameter of a celestial body being eclipsed. This applies to all celestial eclipses. The magnitude of a partial or annular solar eclipse is always between 0.0 and 1.0, while the magnitude of a total solar eclipse is always at least 1.0.
This measure should not be confused with the covered fraction of the apparent area (disk) of the eclipsed body, whereas the magnitude of an eclipse is strictly a ratio of diameters. Neither should it be confused with the astronomical magnitude scale of apparent brightness.
