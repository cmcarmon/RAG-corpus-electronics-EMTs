dependent (or pink) noise. The spectrum of the former is
constant to frequencies as high as 1014 Hz. In the latter, the
noise power is a function of 1=f n, where typically n ¼ 1
(although some forms of noise obey a power relationship
with n  2). The total noise power in an element, as shown
in Figure 2.2, is the combination of both, and a clear knee
frequency is observed. The terms SIw and SIp are used to refer
to the speciﬁc contributions of white and pink noise, respec-
tively, to the total noise power.
