 1 and e2 are still 180 degrees out of phase with the current (iS) that produces them.
The change to a lagging secondary current rotates the vectors in a clockwise direction. This causes el to
become more in phase with ep while e2 is shifted further out of phase with ep. The vector sum of ep and e2
is less than that of ep and e1. Above the center frequency, diode CR1 conducts more than diode CR2.
Because of this heavier conduction, the voltage developed across R3 is greater than the voltage developed
across R4; the output voltage is positive.
