The third folio contains 10 drawings and commentary on the following: science of machines, balances, energy, and circular motion.
Leonardo begins folio 3 with a declaration stating the science of machines is the most useful science overall because of its use by any moving object.
He goes on to state that objects of different shapes that are on different degrees of slope have different amounts of energy. His next topic is about the construction of a certain balance in which circular motion is prevented. The diagrams in this folio represent round balances and multiple shaped objects on differing slopes that are connected together.
