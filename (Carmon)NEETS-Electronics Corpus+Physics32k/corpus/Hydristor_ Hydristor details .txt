There are several problems with the historical design. The vane tips radially contact the cam ring elliptic surface and cause a significant friction as the rotor and vanes turn. This friction is both pressure dependent and speed squared dependent due to RPM-squared centripetal forces. The speed is limited to about 6-7,000 RPM and the pressure is limited to about 2,500 PSI. Another pressure-related problem is that the pressure forces into the axial rotor to stationary kidney endplate clearance and buckles the device ends thus increasing fluid blowby referred to as 'volumetric efficiency'. Typically, vane pumps and motors have two external ports but there are actually two separate sets of chambers which form two separate pumps and motors. The internal plumbing is y-connected to create only two external ports.
For the Hydristor. a 'concentric nesting of endless metal belts' replaces the fixed elliptic cam ring. And, all the vane tips contact the inner surface of the belt. The historical friction of the vane tips now causes the belt set to rotate at approximately the same speed as the rotor and vanes, but there is a very slight 'walking behind' of the vane contact area and there is a very slight speed slippage which results in the inner belt wear being spread out and this results in much longer belt life. Also, the belt set now confines the pressure and speed-squared forces like a pressure vessel and the potential speed of operation is very much higher. The result of all this is to raise both the operating pressure and the operating speed and this amounts to a 10 times increase in hydraulic packaging density and similar decrease in weight per unit power.
