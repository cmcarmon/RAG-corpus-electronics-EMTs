Cross sections are usually measured at 20 °C. To account for the dependence with temperature of the medium (viz. the target), the following formula is used:

{\displaystyle \sigma =\sigma _{0}\left({\frac {T_{0}}{T}}\right)^{\frac {1}{2}},}

where σ is the cross section at temperature T, and σ0 the cross section at temperature T0 (T and T0 in kelvins).
The energy is defined at the most likely energy and velocity of the neutron. The neutron population consists of a Maxwellian distribution, and hence the mean energy and velocity will be higher. Consequently also a Maxveliian correction-term (sqrt(Pi)/2) has to be included when caclulating the cross-section Equation 38.
