fast and efﬁcient searching, ﬁltering, and adaptation of multi-
media content (Salembier and Smith, 2001; Smith, 2003). In
MPEG-7, the application of UMA was conceived to allow the
scalable or adaptive delivery of multimedia by providing tools
for describing transcoding hints and content variations (van
Beek et al., 2003; Smith and Reddy, 2001). MPEG-21 addresses
the description of user environment, which includes terminals
and networks (Smith, 2002). Furthermore,
in MPEG-21,
digital item adaptation facilitates the adaptation of digital
items and media resources for usage environment. The
MPEG-21 digital item adaptation provides tools for describing
user preferences and usage history in addition to tools for
digital item and media resource adaptation (Salembier and
Smith, 2001).
