The basic concept of SPECT is illustrated in Fig. 116.1(C). A gamma ray photon from a radionuclide with
energy above 100 keV will typically escape from the body without further interaction, and thus the body can
be regarded as a transparent object with luminosity proportional to the concentration of the radionuclide at
each point. The reconstruction mathematics are similar to those derived for absorption CT, with the exception
that the variable reconstructed is a source distribution rather than an attenuation coefÔ¨Åcient. Some errors can
be introduced in the reconstruction because of the inevitable interaction of gamma rays with overlying tissue,
even at energies above 100 keV, although this can be compensated for to some extent. Detection of scattered
radiation can be reduced through the use of an energy acceptance window in the detector.
