Thevenin’s Theorem states that it is possible to simplify any linear circuit, no matter how
complex, to an equivalent circuit with just a single voltage source and series resistance con-
nected to a load. The qualiﬁcation of “linear” is identical to that found in the Superposition
Theorem, where all the underlying equations must be linear (no exponents or roots). If we’re
dealing with passive components (such as resistors, and later, inductors and capacitors), this is
true. However, there are some components (especially certain gas-discharge and semiconduc-
tor components) which are nonlinear: that is, their opposition to current changes with voltage
and/or current. As such, we would call circuits containing these types of components, nonlinear
circuits.
