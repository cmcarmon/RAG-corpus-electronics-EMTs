where a1 is the signal component of z(T) when s1(t) is trans-
mitted and where a2 is the signal component of z(T) when
s2(t) is transmitted.
The threshold level, l0, represented by (a1 Ã¾ a2)=2, is the
optimum threshold to minimize the probability of making an
incorrect decision for this important special case. The strategy
is known as the minimum error criterion.
