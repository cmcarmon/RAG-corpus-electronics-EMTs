Strictly speaking, in a single crystal the electric ﬁeld resulting from an applied electric current and magnetic
ﬁeld, both of arbitrary direction relative to crystal axes and each other, cannot be fully described in terms of a
second-order resistivity tensor. [Hurd, 1972, p. 71] On the other hand, Eqs. (52.1), (52.9), and (52.10) do deﬁne
the Hall coefﬁcient in terms of a second-order resistivity tensor for a polycrystalline (assumed isotropic) sample
or for a cubic single crystal or for a lower symmetry crystal when the applied ﬁelds are oriented along major
symmetry directions. In real world applications the Hall effect is always treated in this manner.
