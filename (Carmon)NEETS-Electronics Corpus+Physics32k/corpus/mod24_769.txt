RECEIVER SENSITIVITY is the minimum amount of optical power required to achieve a specific
receiver performance. For digital transmission at a given data rate and coding, this performance is
described by a maximum bit-error rate (BER). In analog systems, for a given modulation and bandwidth,
it is described by a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
