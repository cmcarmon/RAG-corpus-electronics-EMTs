Diagnostic X-ray beams can be collimated to large or small beams. A large beam will emit more intensities of the beam along the cathode-anode axis than a small beam. A large image receptor will also capture more of this beam than a small receptor. Both of these factors will greatly influence the visibility of the anode heel effect. A smaller field size results in a less pronounced heel effect.
