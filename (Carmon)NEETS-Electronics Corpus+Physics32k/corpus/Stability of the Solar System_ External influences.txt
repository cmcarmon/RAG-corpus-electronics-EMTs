Objects coming from outside the solar system can also affect it. Though they are not technically part of the solar system for the purposes of studying the system's intrinsic stability, they nevertheless can change the system. Unfortunately predicting the potential influences of these extrasolar objects is even more difficult than predicting the influences of objects within the system simply because of the sheer distances involved. Among the known objects with a potential to significantly impact the solar system is the star Gliese 710, which is expected to pass near the system in approximately 1.35 million years. Though the star is not expected to substantially affect the orbits of the major planets, it could substantially disrupt the OORT cloud which could cause major asteroid activity throughout the solar system. There are at least a dozen other stars that have a potential to make a close approach in the next few million years.
