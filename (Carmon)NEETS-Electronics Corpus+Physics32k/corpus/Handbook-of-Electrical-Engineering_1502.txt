2. A set of observations  O = (O1, O2, …, OT). The observations can be a set of discrete symbols chosen
from  a  ﬁnite  set,  or  continuous  signals  (or  vectors).  In  speech  recognition  application,  although  it  is
possible  to  convert  continuous  speech  representations  into  a  sequence  of  discrete  symbols  via  vector
quantization codebooks and other methods, serious degradation tends to result from such discretization
of the signal. In this article, we focus on HMMs with continuous observation output densities to model
continuous signals.
