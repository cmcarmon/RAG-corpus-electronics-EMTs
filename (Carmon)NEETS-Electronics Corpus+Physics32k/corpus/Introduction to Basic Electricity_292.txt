A	microcontroller	is	a	small	device	that	serves	as	the	computer	in	a	circuit;	it	is	a
common	tool	that	can	be	found	in	remote	controls,	smart	medical	assistance
equipment,	office	machines,	state-of-the-art	appliances,	and	engine	control
systems.	With	the	rapid	pace	of	various	information-retrieval	operations,	its
function	of	addressing	size,	cost,	time,	and	performance	concerns	offers	privileges
a	user	with	improved	overall	performance.	It	is	usually	implanted	on	a	separate
electronic	device	before	or	after	that	device	is	finished.	In	certain	cases,	it	uses	4-
bit	words	and	low	frequency	clock-rate	operations.
