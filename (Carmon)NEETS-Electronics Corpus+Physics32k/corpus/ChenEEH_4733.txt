Here, we will develop a direct adaptive control method for
the class of systems in equation 12.1. We assume that the
interpolation functions rj are known, but the functions f j
i
and c j
i (which constitute the underlying time-varying dynam-
ics of the system) are unknown. In an indirect adaptive meth-
odology, one would attempt
to identify the unknown
functions and then construct a stabilizing control law based
on the approximations to the plant dynamics. Here, however,
we will postulate the existence of an ideal control law (based on
the assumption that the plant belongs to the class of systems
of equation 12.1) that possesses some desired stabilizing
properties, and then we devise adaptation laws that attempt
to approximate the ideal control equation. This approximation
will be performed within a compact set Sxn  Rn of arbitrary
size that contains the origin. In this manner, the results
obtained are semiglobal, in the sense that they are valid as
long as the state remains within Sxn ; this set can be made as
large as desired by the designer. In particular, with enough
plant information, the set can be made large enough so that
the state never exits it because, as will be shown, a bound can
