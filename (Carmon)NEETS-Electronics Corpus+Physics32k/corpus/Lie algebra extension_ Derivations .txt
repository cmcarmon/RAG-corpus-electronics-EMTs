A derivation δ on a Lie algebra g is a map




δ
:

{\displaystyle \delta :{\mathfrak {g}}\rightarrow {\mathfrak {g}}}

such that the Leibniz rule

{\displaystyle \delta [G_{1},G_{2}]=[\delta G_{1},G_{2}]+[G_{1},\delta G_{2}]}

It is the Lie algebra of the group Aut g of automorphisms of g. One has to show

If the rhs holds, differentiate and set t = 0 implying that the lhs holds. If the lhs holds (A), write the rhs as

and differentiate the rhs of this expression. It is, using (A), identically zero. Hence the rhs of this expression is independent of t and equals its value for t = 0, which is the lhs of this expression.
If G ∈ g, then adG, acting by adG1(G2) = [G1, G2], is a derivation. The set adG: G ∈ g is the set of inner derivations on g. For finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras all derivations are inner derivations.
