The stops, or plosives, are transient, noncontinuant con-
sonants produced by building up pressure behind a total
constriction of the vocal tract and suddenly releasing this
pressure. The constriction can be at the lips (=b= in be and
=p= in pea), at the gum ridge (=d= in day, and =t= in tea), or at
the soft or hard palate (=g= in go, =k= in key). The consonants
=p, t, k= are unvoiced stops; =b, d, g= are voiced.
