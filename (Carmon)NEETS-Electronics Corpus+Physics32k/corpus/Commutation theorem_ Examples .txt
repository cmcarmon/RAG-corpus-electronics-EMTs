One of the simplest cases of the commutation theorem, where it can easily be seen directly, is that of a finite group Γ acting on the finite-dimensional inner product space

Exactly the same results remain true if Γ is allowed to be any countable discrete group. The von Neumann algebra λ(Γ)' ' is usually called the group von Neumann algebra of Γ.
Another important example is provided by a probability space (X, μ). The Abelian von Neumann algebra A = L∞(X, μ) acts by multiplication operators on H = L2(X, μ) and the constant function 1 is a cyclic-separating trace vector. It follows that





A

′


=
A
,


{\displaystyle A^{\prime }=A,}


so that A is a maximal Abelian subalgebra of B(H), the von Neumann algebra of all bounded operators on H.
The third class of examples combines the above two. Coming from ergodic theory, it was one of von Neumann's original motivations for studying von Neumann algebras. Let (X, μ) be a probability space and let Γ be a countable discrete group of measure-preserving transformations of (X, μ). The group therefore acts unitarily on the Hilbert space H = L2(X, μ) according to the formula

is a cyclic-separating trace vector. Moreover the modular conjugation operator J and commutant M ' can be explicitly identified.
One of the most important cases of the group–measure space construction is when Γ is the group of integers Z, i.e. the case of a single invertible measurable transformation T. Here T must preserve the probability measure μ. Semifinite traces are required to handle the case when T (or more generally Γ) only preserves an infinite equivalent measure; and the full force of the Tomita–Takesaki theory is required when there is no invariant measure in the equivalence class, even though the equivalence class of the measure is preserved by T (or Γ).
