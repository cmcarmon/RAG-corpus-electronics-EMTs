{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}={\sqrt {-g}}\left[R+R^{2}-4R^{\mu \nu }R_{\mu \nu }+R^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma }R_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma }\right].}

where the coefficients of the extra terms are chosen so that the action reduces to GR in 4 spacetime dimensions and the extra terms are only non-trivial when more dimensions are introduced.
