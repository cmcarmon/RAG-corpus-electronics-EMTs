The continuous wave is used principally for radiotelegraphy; that is, for the transmission of short or
long pulses of rf energy to form the dots and dashes of the Morse code characters. This type of
transmission is sometimes referred to as interrupted continuous wave. Cw transmission was the first type
of radio communication used, and it is still used extensively for long-range communications. Two of the
advantages of cw transmission are a narrow bandwidth, which requires less output power, and a degree of
intelligibility that is high even under severe noise conditions. (For example, when the receiver is in the
vicinity of rotating machinery or thunderstorms.)
