Fading resulting from multipath propagation is variable with frequency since each frequency arrives 
at the receiving point via a different radio path. When a wide band of frequencies is transmitted 
simultaneously, each frequency will vary in the amount of fading. This variation is called SELECTIVE 
FADING. When selective fading occurs, all frequencies of the transmitted signal do not retain their 
original phases and relative amplitudes. This fading causes severe distortion of the signal and limits the 
total signal transmitted.
