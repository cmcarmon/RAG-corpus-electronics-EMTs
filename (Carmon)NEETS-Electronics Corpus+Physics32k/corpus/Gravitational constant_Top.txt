The gravitational constant, also known as the universal gravitational constant, or as Newton's constant, denoted by the letter G, is an empirical physical constant involved in the calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation and in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Its measured value is approximately 6.674×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2.
