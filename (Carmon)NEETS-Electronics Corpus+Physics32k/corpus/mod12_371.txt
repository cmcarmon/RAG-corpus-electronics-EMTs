All of the pulse-modulation systems discussed previously provide methods of converting analog
wave shapes to digital wave shapes (pulses occurring at discrete intervals, some characteristic of which is
varied as a continuous function of the analog wave). The entire range of amplitude (frequency or phase)
values of the analog wave can be arbitrarily divided into a series of standard values. Each pulse of a pulse
train [figure 2-48, view (B)] takes the standard value nearest its actual value when modulated. The
modulating wave can be faithfully reproduced, as shown in views (C) and (D). The amplitude range has
been divided into 5 standard values in view (C). Each pulse is given whatever standard value is nearest its
actual instantaneous value. In view (D), the same amplitude range has been divided into 10 standard
levels. The curve of view (D) is a much closer approximation of the modulating wave, view (A), than is
the 5-level quantized curve in view (C). From this you should see that the greater the number of standard
levels used, the more closely the quantized wave approximates the original. This is also made evident by
the fact that an infinite number of standard levels exactly duplicates the conditions of nonquantization
(the original analog waveform).
