One can calculate the average error in multipath. However, one cannot correct for it as in refraction since
the  direction  of  the  error  cannot  be  known  in  advance  unless  there  are  controlled  conditions  such  as  in  a
carefully controlled experiment. Hence, the general approach is to design the antenna sidelobes to be as low
as  feasible  and  accept  the  multipath  error  that  occurs  when  tracking  close  to  the  horizon.  There  has  been
considerable research to Ô¨Ånd means to reduce the impact, including using very wide bandwidths to separate
the direct path from the multipath return.
