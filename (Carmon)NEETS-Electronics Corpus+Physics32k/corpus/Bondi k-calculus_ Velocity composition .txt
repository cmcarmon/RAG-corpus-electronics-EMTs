Consider three inertial observers Alice, Bob and Ed, arranged in that order and moving at different speeds along the same straight line. In this section, the notation




k

A
B




{\displaystyle k_{AB}}
will be used to denote the k-factor from Alice to Bob (and similarly between other pairs of observers).
As before, Alice sends a blue flash towards Bob and Ed every



T


{\displaystyle T}
seconds, by her clock, which Bob receives every

T


{\displaystyle k_{AB}T}
seconds, by Bob's clock, and Ed receives every

E


T


{\displaystyle k_{AE}T}
seconds, by Ed's clock.
Now suppose that whenever Bob receives a blue flash from Alice he immediately sends his own red flash towards Ed, once every




k

A
B


T


{\displaystyle k_{AB}T}
seconds by Bob's clock, so Ed receives a red flash from Bob every




k

E


(

)


{\displaystyle k_{BE}(k_{AB}T)}
seconds, by Ed's clock. Einstein's second postulate, that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source, implies that Alice's blue flash and Bob's red flash both travel at the same speed, neither overtaking the other, and therefore arrive at Ed at the same time. Therefore, as measured by Ed, the red flash interval

(

)


{\displaystyle k_{BE}(k_{AB}T)}
and the blue flash interval




k

T


{\displaystyle k_{AE}T}
must be the same. So the rule for combining k-factors is simply multiplication:





k

=

.


{\displaystyle k_{AE}=k_{AB}k_{BE}.}

Finally, substituting
