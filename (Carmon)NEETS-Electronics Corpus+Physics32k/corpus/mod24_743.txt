As stated previously, a fiber optic receiver consists of an optical detector, an amplifier, and other
circuitry. In most fiber optic systems, the optical detector is a PIN photodiode or APD. Receiver
performance varies depending on the type of detector used. The amplifier is generally described as having
two stages: the preamplifier and the postamplifier. The preamplifier is defined as the first stage of
amplification following the optical detector. The postamplifier is defined as the remaining stages of
amplification required to raise the detector's electrical signal to a level suitable for further signal
processing. The preamplifier is the dominant contributor of electrical noise in the receiver. Because of
this, its design has a significant influence in determining the sensitivity of the receiver.
