Example 73.2 Consider a random variable X taking on the values {1, 2, 3} with probabilities (0.5, 0.25,
0.25). An instantaneous code for this random variable might be (0, 10, 11). Thus, a string 01001110 can be
uniquely parsed into 0, 10, 0, 11, 10, which decodes to the string x = (1, 2, 1, 3, 2). Note that the average
length of the code is 1.5 bits, which is the same as the entropy of the source.
