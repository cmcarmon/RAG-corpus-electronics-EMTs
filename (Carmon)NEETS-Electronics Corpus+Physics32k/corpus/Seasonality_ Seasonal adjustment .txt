Seasonal adjustment is any method for removing the seasonal component of a time series. The resulting seasonally adjusted data are used, for example, when analyzing or reporting non-seasonal trends over durations rather longer than the seasonal period. An appropriate method for seasonal adjustment is chosen on the basis of a particular view taken of the decomposition of time series into components designated with names such as "trend", "cyclic", "seasonal" and "irregular", including how these interact with each other. For example, such components might act additively or multiplicatively. Thus, if a seasonal component acts additively, the adjustment method has two stages:
estimate the seasonal component of variation in the time series, usually in a form that has a zero mean across series;
subtract the estimated seasonal component from the original time series, leaving the seasonally adjusted series:




Y

S

=

T

+

E

t




{\displaystyle Y_{t}-S_{t}=T_{t}+E_{t}}
.
If it is a multiplicative model,the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations will vary with the level, which is more likely to occur with economic series. When taking seasonality into account, the seasonally adjusted multiplicative decomposition can be written as




Y

t



/


S

t


=

T

t


∗

E

t




{\displaystyle Y_{t}/S_{t}=T_{t}*E_{t}}
; whereby the original time series is divided by the estimated seasonal component.
The multiplicative model can be transformed into an additive model by taking the log of the time series;
