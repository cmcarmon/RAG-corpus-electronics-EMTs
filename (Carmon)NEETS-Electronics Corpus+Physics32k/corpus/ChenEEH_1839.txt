. Session announcement: Session Announcement Protocol
(SAP) (Handley et al., 2000; Arora and Jain, 1999) is used
for advertising multicast conferences and other multicast
sessions. An SAP announcer periodically multicasts an-
nouncement packets to a well-known multicast address
and port (port number 9875) with the same scope as the
session it is announcing, ensuring that the recipients of
the announcement can also be potential recipients of the
session being advertised. Multiple announcers may also
announce a single session to increase robustness against
packet loss or failure of one or more announcers. The
time period between repetitions of an announcement is
chosen such that the total bandwidth used by all an-
nouncements on a single SAP group remains below a
preconÔ¨Ågured limit. Each announcer is expected to listen
to other announcements to determine the total number
of sessions being announced on a particular group. SAP is
intended to announce the existence of a long-lived wide
area multicast sessions and involves a large startup delay
before a complete set of announcements is heard by a
listener. SAP also contains mechanisms for ensuring in-
tegrity of session announcements, for authenticating the
origin of an announcement, and for encrypting such
announcements.
