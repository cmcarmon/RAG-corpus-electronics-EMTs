For linear time-invariant systems, BIBO stability and zero-
input stability all have the same requirement: the roots of the
characteristic equations must be located in the left half of the s
plane. Thus, if a system is BIBO stable, it must also be zero-
input or asymptotically stable. For this reason, the present
discussion will simply refer to the stability of linear time-invari-
ant systems without mentioning BIBO or zero-input. This
chapter also often refers to the situation when the characteristic
equation has simple roots on the jv axis and none in the right
half of the s plane as marginally stable or marginally unstable.
