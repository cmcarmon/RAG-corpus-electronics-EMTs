Once  again,  it  is  worth  comparing  this  value  with 
the  steady-state  value  (hFE).  Since  the  transfer 
characteristic  is  reasonably  linear,  the  values  are 
quite close (45.45 compared with 50). However, if 
the  transfer  characteristic  was  perfectly  linear  the 
value of hfe  would be exactly the same as that  for 
hFE.
