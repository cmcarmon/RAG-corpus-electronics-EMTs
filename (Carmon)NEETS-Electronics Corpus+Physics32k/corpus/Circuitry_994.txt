Boolean algebra 
 
The  laws  of  Boolean  algebra  are  quite  different 
from those of ordinary algebra. For example: 
 
A · 0 = 0
A · 1 = A
A + 0 = A
A + 1 = 1
The Commutative Law shows us that: 
 
A + B = B + A
and also that: 
 
A · B = B · A
The Associative Law shows us that: 
 
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C = A + B + C
and also that: 
 
A · (B · C ) = (A · B ) · C = A · B · C
The Distributive Law shows us that: 
 
A · (B + C) = A · B + B · C
and also that: 
 
A + (B · C ) = (A + B ) · (A + C )
All  of  the  above  laws  can  be  proved  using  the 
various techniques that we met earlier. 
 
Boolean simplification 
 
Using 
laws  of  Boolean  algebra  and  De 
Morgan’s theorem, A · B = A + B (see earlier) we 
can reduce complex logical expressions in order to 
minimize the number of  variables and the  number 
of terms. For example, the expression that we met 
earlier can be simplified as follows: 
 
b
j
Here  we  have  eliminated  the  variable  C from  the 
first and second pair of terms and then eliminated B 
from  the  result.  You  might  like  to  compare  this 
with  the  Karnaugh  map  that  we  drew  earlier  in 
Figure A8.30!
