The study of the frequency domain combines these two notions–a system’s sinusoidal response is easy to
ﬁnd and a linear system’s output to a sum of inputs is the sum of the individual outputs—to develop the
crucial idea of a signal’s spectrum. We begin by ﬁnding that those signals that can be represented as a
sum of sinusoids is very large. In fact, all signals can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoids.
As this story unfolds, we’ll see that information systems rely heavily on spectral ideas. For example,
radio, television, and cellular telephones transmit over diﬀerent portions of the spectrum. In fact, spectrum
is so important that communications systems are regulated as to which portions of the spectrum they can use
by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States and by International Treaty for the world
(see Frequency Allocation Chart in Section 7.3). Calculating the spectrum is easy: The Fourier transform
deﬁnes how we can ﬁnd a signal’s spectrum.
4.2 Fourier Series2
In an earlier module (Exercise 2.4), we showed that a square wave could be expressed as a superposition of
pulses. As useful as this decomposition was in this example, it does not generalize well to other periodic
signals: How can a superposition of pulses equal a smooth signal like a sinusoid? Because of the importance
of sinusoids to linear systems, you might wonder whether they could be added together to represent a large
number of periodic signals. You would be right and in good company as well. Leonhard Euler3 and Carl
Friedrich Gauss4 in particular worried about this problem, and Jean Baptiste Fourier5 got the credit even
though tough mathematical issues were not settled until later. They worked on what is now known as the
Fourier series: representing any periodic signal as a superposition of sinusoids.
