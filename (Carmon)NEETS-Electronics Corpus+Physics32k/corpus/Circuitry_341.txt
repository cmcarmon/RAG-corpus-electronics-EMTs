voltage  can  be  applied  to  a  tuned  circuit  load  in 
order  to  recreate  a  sinusoidal  signal.  In  effect,  the 
pulses will excite the tuned circuit and its inherent 
flywheel  action  will  produce  a  sinusoidal  output 
waveform. This mode of operation is only used in 
RF power amplifiers that must operate at very high 
levels  of  efficiency.  Table  7.1  summarizes  the 
classes of operation used in amplifiers.
