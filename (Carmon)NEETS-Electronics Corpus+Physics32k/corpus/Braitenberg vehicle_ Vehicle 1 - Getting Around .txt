A first vehicle has one sensor (e.g. a temperature detector) that directly stimulates its single wheel in a directly proportional way. The vehicle can stand still or move forward at varying speed. The effect of friction will make the vehicle move in unpredictable ways at low speeds (i.e. at low temperatures) in a way akin to Brownian motion.
This behavior might be understood by a human observer as a creature that is 'alive' like an insect and 'restless', never stopping in its movement.
