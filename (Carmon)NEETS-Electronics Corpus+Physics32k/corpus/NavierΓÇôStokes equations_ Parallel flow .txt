Assume steady, parallel, one dimensional, non-convective pressure-driven flow between parallel plates, the resulting scaled (dimensionless) boundary value problem is:








d

u


d

y

=

;

u
(
0
)
=
u
(
1
)
=
0.


{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}u}{dy^{2}}}=-1;\quad u(0)=u(1)=0.}

The boundary condition is the no slip condition. This problem is easily solved for the flow field:




u
(
y
)
=



y
−

y

.


{\displaystyle u(y)={\frac {y-y^{2}}{2}}.}

From this point onward more quantities of interest can be easily obtained, such as viscous drag force or net flow rate.
