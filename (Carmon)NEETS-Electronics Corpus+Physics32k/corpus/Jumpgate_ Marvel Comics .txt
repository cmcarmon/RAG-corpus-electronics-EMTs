In the Marvel Universe, Jump Gates are used by the United States Government to connect each state superhero team of the Fifty State Initiative with the Negative Zone's Prison 42 and in turn the other states Jump Gates. However, State jumps wear down the point between positive and negative space so the jumps are used sparingly.
An alien race called the Shi'ar use Stargates which can transport matter across intergalactic distances. There is a large Shi'ar stargate on the edge of our Solar System, but it requires a massive amount of energy to activate, and is hazardous to use since it has the potential to destabilize a star.
Xandar was given the Star Gate technology as a result of their alliance with the Shi'ar. Later, while in possession of the entire Nova Force, Richard Rider (Nova Prime) was able to physically generate a Stargate at will without any mechanical equipment.
