Eﬃcient speech transmission systems exploit the speech signal’s special structure: What makes speech
speech? You can conjure many signals that span the same frequencies as speech—car engine sounds, violin
music, dog barks—but don’t sound at all like speech. We shall learn later that transmission of any 5 kHz
bandwidth signal requires about 80 kbps (thousands of bits per second) to transmit digitally. Speech signals
can be transmitted using less than 1 kbps because of its special structure. To reduce the “digital bandwidth”
so drastically means that engineers spent many years to develop signal processing and coding methods that
could capture the special characteristics of speech without destroying how it sounds. If you used a speech
transmission system to send a violin sound, it would arrive horribly distorted; speech transmitted the same
way would sound ﬁne.
