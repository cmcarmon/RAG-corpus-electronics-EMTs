With each successively higher voltage range, more multiplier resistors are pressed into
service by the selector switch, making their series resistances add for the necessary total. For
example, with the range selector switch set to the 1000 volt position, we need a total multiplier
resistance value of 999.5 kΩ. With this meter design, that’s exactly what we’ll get:
