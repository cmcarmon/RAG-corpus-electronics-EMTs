A SERIES-FED, TUNED-COLLECTOR ARMSTRONG OSCILLATOR is illustrated in figure 2-9, 
view (A). The dc path is from the negative side (ground) of VCC through RE, Q1, T1, and back to the 
positive side of VCC. The figure clearly illustrates that both the ac and dc components flow through the 
tank circuit.
