Electrostriction is a fundamental electromechanical coupling effect. In ceramics with large dielectric constants
and  in  some  polymers,  large  electrostrictive  strains  may  be  induced  that  are  comparable  in  magnitude  with
piezoelectric strains in actuator materials such as PZT. The converse electrostrictive effect, which is the change
in  dielectric  susceptibility  with  applied  stress,  facilitates  the  use  of  the  electrostrictor  as  a  stress  gauge.  The
second converse effect may be used to tune the piezoelectric coefﬁcients of the material as a function of the
applied  ﬁeld.  Electrostrictive  materials  offer  tunable  nonlinear  properties  that  are  suitable  for  application  in
very smart systems.
