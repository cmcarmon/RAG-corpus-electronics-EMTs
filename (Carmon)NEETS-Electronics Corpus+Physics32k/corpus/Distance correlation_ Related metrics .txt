Other correlational metrics, including kernel-based correlational metrics (such as the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion or HSIC) can also detect linear and nonlinear interactions. Both distance correlation and kernel-based metrics can be used in methods such as canonical correlation analysis and independent component analysis to yield stronger statistical power.
