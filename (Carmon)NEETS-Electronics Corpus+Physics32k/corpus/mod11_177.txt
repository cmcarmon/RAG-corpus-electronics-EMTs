In figure 2-32, consider electron Q1, which is shown entering the field around the slot entrance to 
cavity A. The clockwise rotation of the electron path is caused by the interaction of the magnetic field 
around the moving electron with the permanent magnetic field. The permanent magnetic field is assumed 
to be going into the paper in figure 2-32 (the action of an electron moving in an H field was explained
