Checking that the physical condition of the drum, drum head and hardware that is to be used are in appropriate condition.
Seating the head to shape the generic factory-shaped head to match the specific drum being used.
Tuning the batter head to pitch.
Tuning the resonant head to pitch relative to the batter head.
Relating each drum's pitch and sustain to the other drums in the drum set to make the drum set a pleasant-sounding unit in accordance with the drummer's requirements.
When tensioning a head, the tensioning rod closest to the tensioner should be tightened first. The reason for this is to keep an even tension across the drum head, which is impossible to do if the lugs are tightened differently. Next, the tension rod opposite the first lug is tightened by the same number of turns. The process is repeated for the remaining lugs in order, moving from one side of the head to the other.
When all of the rods are tightened, the first rod is once again tightened, and the process is repeated once again for each rod until the head is free of wrinkles and a very low tone is produced when hit.
The rods are further tightened in order and incrementally, by no more than a quarter turn each time. From time to time, the head is tapped next to each tension rod and the rods are tightened and loosened so that the tones are the same all around the drum.
The procedure is repeated until the head has the desired pitch. At times it may be desirable to use a specific key or individual musical notes to tune each drum to, creating more melodic tones and a more musical sound to the drums. The head is tapped once more around the edge to ensure even tuning. If double-headed drums are used, the procedure needs to be repeated with the bottom head.
