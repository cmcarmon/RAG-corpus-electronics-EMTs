Microwave  circuits  use  two  types  of  active  devices:  two-terminal  devices,  referred  to  as  diodes,  such  as
, and three-terminal
Schottky, Gunn, tunnel, impact avalanche and transit time (IMPATT), varactor, and 
devices, referred to as transistors, such as bipolar junction transistor (BJT), metal semiconductor ﬁeld effect
transistor (MESFET), high electron mobility transistor (HEMT), heterostructure FET (HFET), and heterojunc-
multipli-
tion bipolar transistor (HBT). Microwave circuits using these devices include 
phase shifters
switches
mixers
attenuators
ers
, modulators, and many others used for receiver or transmitter

computer-
applications  covering  microwave  and  millimeter  wave  frequency  bands.  New  devices,  microwave 
aided design (CAD)
 tools, and automated testing have played a signiﬁcant role in the advancement of these
circuits during the past decade. The theory and performance of most of these circuits have been well documented

used  in  such  applications  as  radar,  communication,  navigation,  electronic  warfare  (EW),  smart  weapons,
