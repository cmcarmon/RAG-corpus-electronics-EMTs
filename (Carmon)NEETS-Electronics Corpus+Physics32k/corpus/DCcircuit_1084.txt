So far in our discussions on electricity and electric circuits, we have not discussed in any detail
how batteries function. Rather, we have simply assumed that they produce constant voltage
through some sort of mysterious process. Here, we will explore that process to some degree and
cover some of the practical considerations involved with real batteries and their use in power
systems.
