One type of parallel line is the TWO-WIRE OPEN LINE illustrated in figure 3-2. This line consists
of two wires that are generally spaced from 2 to 6 inches apart by insulating spacers. This type of line is
most often used for power lines, rural telephone lines, and telegraph lines. It is sometimes used as a
transmission line between a transmitter and an antenna or between an antenna and a receiver. An
advantage of this type of line is its simple construction. The principal disadvantages of this type of line
are the high radiation losses and electrical noise pickup because of the lack of shielding. Radiation losses
are produced by the changing fields created by the changing current in each conductor.
