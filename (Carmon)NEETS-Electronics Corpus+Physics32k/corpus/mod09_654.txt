At T1 the input signal reverses polarity and becomes negative-going. Although the charge on 
capacitor C1 cannot change instantly, the applied negative voltage is equal to or greater than the charge 
on C1. This causes the anode of D2 to become negative and conduction ceases. When D2 stops 
conducting e out is at 0. C1 quickly discharges through D1 since its cathode is now negative with respect to 
ground. Between T1 and T2 the input pulse is again at the 0-volt level and D2 remains in a nonconducting 
state. Since the very short time constant provided by the conduction resistance of D1 and C1 is so much 
less than the long time constant offered by D2 and R1 during the conduction period, C1 is always 
completely discharged between pulses. Thus, for each input pulse, a precise level of charge is deposited 
on C1. For each charge of C1 an identical output pulse is produced by the flow of ic through R1. Since 
this current flow always occurs in the direction indicated by the solid arrow, the dc output voltage is 
positive.
