The block diagram of the servomechanism of Figure 16.2.7 is given in Figure 16.2.8, in
which the transfer function of each component is shown. Since the actuating signal is given by
E = Kp(R − C), the block diagram may be simpliﬁed, as shown in Figure 16.2.9, in which
TL is assumed to be zero for simplicity. The direct transmission function (forward path transfer
function) for the system can be seen to be
