In practice Eqs. (55.9) and (55.10) are modiÔ¨Åed due to a distribution in the relaxation times either because
several different loss processes are involved or as a result of interaction or cooperative movement between the
discrete dipoles or the trapped and detrapped charge carriers in their own particular environment. Since the
relaxation processes are thermally activated, an increase in temperature will cause a displacement of the loss
peak to higher frequencies. In the case of ionic and dipole relaxation, the relaxation time may be described by
the relation
