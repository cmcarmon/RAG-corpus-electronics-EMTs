A hub monitoring and control (M&C) system provides the monitoring and control of the RF equipment
and  baseband  equipment.  Redundant  RF  equipment  is  common  at  a  hub,  and  the  M&C  system  is  used  to
monitor  the  components  and  provide  automatic  switchover  in  the  event  of  equipment  failure.  Switchover
between  equipment  can  occur  either  by  operator  initiation  or  automatically  by  the  M&C  upon  sensing  an
equipment failure.
