Dispersion refers to the spreading of a pulse as it travels along a single-mode ﬁber. It is due to material and
waveguide effects. This spreading creates intersymbol interference if allowed to exceed about 70% of the original
pulse width, causing receiver errors. The dispersion factor M is usually given in units of picoseconds of pulse
spread per nanometer of spectral width of the light source and per kilometer of length of ﬁber.
