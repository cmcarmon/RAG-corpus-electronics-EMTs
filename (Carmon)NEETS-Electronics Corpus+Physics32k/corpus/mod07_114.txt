Now that you are familiar with P- and N-type materials, how these materials are joined together to
form a diode, and the function of the diode, let us continue our discussion with the operation of the PN
junction. But before we can understand how the PN junction works, we must first consider current flow in
the materials that make up the junction and what happens initially within the junction when these two
materials are joined together.
Current Flow in the N-Type Material
