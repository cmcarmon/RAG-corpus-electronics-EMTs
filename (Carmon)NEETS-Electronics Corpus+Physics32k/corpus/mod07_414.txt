One complete cycle of operation will be discussed to help you understand how this circuit works. We 
have discussed transformers in previous modules in the NEETS series and will not go into their 
characteristics at this time. Let us assume the transformer is working properly and there is a positive 
potential at point A and a negative potential at point B. The positive potential at point A will forward bias 
D3 and reverse bias D4. The negative potential at point B will forward bias D1 and reverse bias D2. At 
this time D3 and D1 are forward biased and will allow current flow to pass through them; D4 and D2 are 
reverse biased and will block current flow. The path for current flow is from point B through D1, up 
through RL, through D3, through the secondary of the transformer back to point B. This path is indicated 
by the solid arrows. Waveforms (1) and (2) can be observed across D1 and D3.
