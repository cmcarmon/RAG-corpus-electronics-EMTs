The particular manner of evaluating the coefÔ¨Åcients of the expansion is dependent upon the nature
of the roots of D1(s) in Equation (3.3.10). We shall now discuss different cases of interest. The
possible forms of the roots are (1) real and simple (or distinct) roots, (2) conjugate complex roots,
and (3) multiple roots.
