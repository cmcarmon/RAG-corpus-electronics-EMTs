Other than a mathematical equation, a DSP algorithm has a
variety of different representations including a nested Do-loop
algorithm, recurrent algorithm, and data/signal ﬂow graph.
The DSP algorithm can also be classiﬁed as a terminating
and a nonterminating program. Unlike the terminating pro-
gram, a nonterminating one is speciﬁed to execute for an
inﬁnite amount of time.
