In analog transmission between the base station and the mobile user, the 3-kHz wide audio
signal is transmitted via FM using a channel bandwidth of 30 kHz. Such a large bandwidth
expansion (by a factor of 10) is needed to obtain a sufÔ¨Åciently large SNR at the output of
the FM demodulator. Since the use of FM is indeed wasteful of the radio frequency spectrum,
cellular telephone systems based on digital transmission of digitized compressed speech are later
developed. With the same available channel bandwidth, the system then accommodates a four-
to tenfold increase in the number of simultaneous users.
