Cells  are  of  either  a  two-  or  a  one-transistor  design. Where  two

The two transistors in series then assume the threshold of the second (enhancement) transistor, or a very high
threshold  as  determined  by  the  programmable  transistor.  Some  designs  are  so  cleverly  integrated  that  the
features of the two transistors are merged.
