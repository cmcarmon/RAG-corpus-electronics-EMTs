Chapter 9, ‘‘High-Level Petri Nets Extensions, Analysis, and
Applications,’’ by Xudong He and Tadao Murata, presents
analysis techniques for several extended Petri net models,
explores speciﬁc system properties, such as performance, reli-
ability, and schedulability, and describes their beneﬁts for
many applications in computer science disciplines. Petri nets
provide a formal model
for concurrent and distributed
systems.
