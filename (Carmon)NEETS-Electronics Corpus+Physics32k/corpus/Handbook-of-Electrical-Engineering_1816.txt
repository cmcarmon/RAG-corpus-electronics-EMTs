Temporal Effects
One relevant temporal phenomenon is the ﬂicker fusion frequency. This is a temporal threshold which deter-
mines  the  point  at  which  the  HVS  fuses  the  motion  in  a  sequence  of  frames.  Unfortunately  this  frequency
varies as a function of the average luminance. The HVS is more sensitive to ﬂicker at high luminances than at
low luminances. The spatial-temporal frequency response of the HVS is important in determining the sensitivity
to small-amplitude stimuli. In both the temporal and spatial directions, the HVS responds as a bandpass ﬁlter
(see Fig. 17.22). Also signiﬁcant is the fact that the spatial and temporal properties are not independent of one
another, especially at low frequencies.
