The Ideal Op Amp
An 
is a dc-coupled ampliﬁer having two inputs and normally one output (although
in  a  few  infrequent  cases  there  may  be  a  differential  output).  The  inputs  are  designated  as  noninverting
(designated  +  or  NI)  and  inverting  (designated  –  or  Inv.).  The  ampliﬁed  signal  is  the 
v
,
e
between the two inputs, so that the output voltage as indicated in Fig. 27.1 is
