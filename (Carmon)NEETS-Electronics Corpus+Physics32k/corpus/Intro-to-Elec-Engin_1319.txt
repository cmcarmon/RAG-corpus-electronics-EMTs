Sampling and Pulse Modulation
In most analog circuits, signals are processed in their entirety. However, in many modern electric
systems, especially those that convert waveforms for processing by digital circuits, such as digital
computers, only sample values of signals are utilized for processing. Sampling makes it possible
to convert an analog signal to discrete form, thereby permitting the use of discrete processing
methods. Also, it is possible to sample an electric signal, transmit only the sample values, and use
them to interpolate or reconstruct the entire waveform at the destination. Sampling of signals and
signal reconstruction from samples have widespread applications in communications and signal
processing.
