In fiber-to-fiber connections, a source of extrinsic coupling loss is poor fiber end preparation. An
optical fiber-end face must be flat, smooth, and perpendicular to the fiber's axis to ensure proper fiber
connection. Light is reflected or scattered at the connection interface unless the connecting fiber end faces
are properly prepared. Figure 4-5 shows some common examples of poor fiber ends. It illustrates a fiber-
end face tilt, lip, and hackle. Quality fiber-end preparation is essential for proper system operation.
