As for LFSRs, LCARs are fully described by a characteristic polynomial, and through it any linear ﬁnite state
machine can be built either as an LFSR or as an LCAR. It is, however, more difﬁcult, given a polynomial, to
derive  the  corresponding  LCAR,  and  tables  are  now  used.  The  main  disadvantage  of  LCARs  is  in  the  area
overhead incurred by the extra EXOR gates necessary for the implementation of the cell rules. This is offset by
their better performance. The corresponding multiple-output compactor is called a MICA.
