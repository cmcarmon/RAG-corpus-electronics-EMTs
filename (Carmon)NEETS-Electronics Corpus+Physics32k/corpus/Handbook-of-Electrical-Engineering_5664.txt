Planning Criteria
Transmission system planning criteria have been developed from the above planning principles and equipment
ratings as well as from actual system operating data, probable operating modes, and equipment failure rates.
These criteria are used to plan and build the transmission network with adequate margins to ensure a reliable
supply  of  power  to  customers  under  reasonable  equipment-outage  contingencies.  The  transmission  system
should perform its basic functions under a wide range of operating conditions. Transmission planning criteria
include equipment loading criteria, transmission voltage criteria, stability criteria, and regional planning criteria.
