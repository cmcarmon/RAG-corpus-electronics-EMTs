Completely Unstructured
In an unstructured case, the space containing the structure of
interest is completely ﬁlled with a collection of lattice cells of
varying sizes and shapes but conforms to the structure surface
(Madsen and Ziolkowski, 1990). As for the case of surface-
ﬁtted lattices, mesh-generation software is available and
capable of modeling complicated three-dimensional shapes
possibly having volumetric inhomogeneities. A key disadvan-
tage of this approach is its potential for numerical inaccuracy
and instability due to the unwanted generation of highly
skewed space cells at random points in the lattice. A second
disadvantage is the difﬁculty in mapping the unstructured
mesh computations onto the architecture of either parallel
vector
computers or massively parallel machines. The
structure-speciﬁc irregularity of the mesh mandates a robust
preprocessing algorithm that optimally assigns speciﬁc mesh
cells to speciﬁc processors.
