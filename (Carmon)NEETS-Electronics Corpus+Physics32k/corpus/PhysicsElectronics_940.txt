Another form of non-volatile random access storage is the read-only memory (ROM). Here
a single memory bit is nothing more than a connection that is either open or closed. The
most common ROM types are known as Ô¨Åeld-programmable (as opposed to factory pro-
grammable). This programming process consists of stepping through all the bits and setting
the necessary ones by burning open the fuse-like material associated with that bit.
