As our first step, we choose to assign the branch variables as shown in
Figure 2.46. Recall that the assignment of voltage and current variables is still
arbitrary (other than the constraint of associated variables), and that the solution
is invariant under this choice.
As our second step, we write the element laws for each of the elements.
The constituent relations for the resistors in this circuit are of the form v = iR,
and the relation for the voltage source is v5 = V. In terms of the variables
