Equally important, we often characterize systems by their frequency
response (that is, sinusoidal response). Examples include our hearing, audio
equipment, ultrasonic pest deterrents, and wireless network receivers. The fre-
quency related behavior of such systems is as important as their time-domain
behavior. Therefore, the sinusoidal steady state response is useful because it is
a natural and convenient way to describe the behavior of linear systems.
