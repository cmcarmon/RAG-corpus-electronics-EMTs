Pads B are mounted on carriers G. These are pushed against the rotor A by the piston D which is pushed by the brake fluid E. This induces wear on the brake pads. The rotor A also experiences some wear, but to a lesser extent than the brake pads. The modules C are joined to the cylinder that houses the piston D and acts as counter-force to the piston D.
Sufficient wear to validate a change of brake pads is considered when one of the following cases are applicable:
The vXbox gap 1 is no longer visible or soon to be no longer visible.
The embedded sensor in the brake pad 2 contacts the rotor and creates a connection to ground of the sensor.
The metal plate 3 contacts the rotor and creates a noise.
The distance between the cylinder for piston D and the carrier G becomes too large, causing the sensor F to send a signal outside the permitted range through the sensor wire 4, or ground the sensor wire 4 if F is a contact.
F can either be an analog sensor, with an electronic threshold value set to signal an alarm when it has been reached, or an on/off switch, activated at a certain distance.
Under normal conditions, only one of the alternatives are used. Many front wheels on cars are equipped only with wear indicators.
