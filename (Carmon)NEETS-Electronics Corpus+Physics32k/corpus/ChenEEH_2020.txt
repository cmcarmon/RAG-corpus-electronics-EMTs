Ignoring the round-off problem, the LHS and RHS of the
above equation should be equal
if there are no errors in
the following: (1) computing the f (v) for all v 2 S (which is
the original computation), (2) summing up the f (v) to get the
RHS, (3) summing up the v, (4) and applying f to the sum to
get the LHS. If the sums are not equal, then an error is
detected. Unfortunately due to round-off, the test of equation
8.4 often fails to hold in the absence of computation errors.
Therefore, an integer version of this test that is not susceptible
to round-off problems was sought. Of course, this integer
checksum test should involve integers derived from the
ï¬‚oating point quantities.
