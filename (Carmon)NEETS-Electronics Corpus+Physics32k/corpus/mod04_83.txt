The wire nut (view A of figure 2-10) is a device commonly used to replace the rattail joint splice. 
The wire nut is housed in plastic insulating material. To use the wire nut, place the two stripped 
conductors into the wire nut and twist the nut. In so doing, this will form a splice like the rattail joint and 
insulate itself by drawing the wire insulation into the wire nut insulation.
