The positively charged screen grid will accelerate electrons across the tube even though the plate is
negative going. As long as the plate remains positive in relation to the cathode, it will draw off these
accelerated electrons. As a result, conduction through the tube when the plate is going negative will not
be decreased. This is another big advantage of screen-grid tubes.
