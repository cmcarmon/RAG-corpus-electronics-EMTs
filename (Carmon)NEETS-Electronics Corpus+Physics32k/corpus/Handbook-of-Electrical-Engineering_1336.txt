the glottal excitation. MBE coders estimate the fundamental frequency and use this estimate to focus subband
decompositions on harmonics. MELP coders perform pitch-synchronous excitation modeling. Overall coder
performance is enhanced in the CELP and MBE coders with the use of sub-integer lags [Kroon and Atal, 1991].
This is equivalent to performing pitch estimation using a signal sampled at a higher sampling rate to improve
the precision of the spectral estimate. Highly precise glottal frequency estimation improves the “naturalness”
of coded speech at the expense of increased computational complexity, and in some cases increased bit rate.
Accurate characterization of pitch and LPC parameters can also be used to good advantage in postﬁltering
to  reduce  apparent  quantization  noise.  These  ﬁlters,  usually  derived  from  forward-adapted  ﬁlter  coefﬁcients
transmitted  to  the  receiver  as  side-information,  perform  post-processing  on  the  reconstructed  speech  which
reduces perceptually annoying noise components [Chen and Gersho, 1995].
