In Fig. 25.35(a), a single buffer drives the entire H-tree network, requiring a large area buffer and wide clock
lines toward the connection of the clock line to the external clock signal. Such a large buffer can account for
up to 30% or more of the total VLSI circuit power dissipation. Figure 25.35(b) illustrates a distributed buffer
approach, with a given buffer only having to drive those clock line segments to the next level of buffers. In this
case, the buffers can be smaller and the clock lines can be narrower. The 300-MHz DEC Alpha microprocessor,
for example, uses an H-tree clock distribution network with multiple stages of buffering extending to the Ô¨Ånal
legs of the H-tree network. Another approach to relax the clock distribution problem uses multiple input/output
(I/O) pins for the clock. In this case, a number of smaller H-trees can be driven separately, one starting at each
clock I/O pin.
