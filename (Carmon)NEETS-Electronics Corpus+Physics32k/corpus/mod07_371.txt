The MOSFETs discussed up to this point have been single-gate MOSFETs. Another type of 
MOSFET, the dual-gate type, is shown in figure 3-57. As the figure shows, the gates in a dual-gate 
MOSFET can be compared to the grids in a multi-grid vacuum tube. Because the substrate has been 
connected directly to the source terminal, the dual-gate MOSFET still has only four leads: one each for 
source and drain, and two for the gates. Either gate can control conduction independently, making this 
type of MOSFET a truly versatile device.
