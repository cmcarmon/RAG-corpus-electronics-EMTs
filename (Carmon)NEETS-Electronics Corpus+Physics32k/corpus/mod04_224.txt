Soldering Tools—The important difference in soldering iron sizes is not the temperature (they all 
produce 500º F to 600º F), but the thermal inertia. Thermal inertia is the ability of soldering tools to 
maintain a satisfactory soldering temperature while giving up heat to the joint to be soldered. A well-
designed soldering iron is self-regulating because its heating element increases with the rising 
temperature, thus inciting the current to a satisfactory level. When using a soldering gun, do not press the 
switch for periods longer than 30 seconds. Doing so will cause the tip to overheat to the point of 
incandescence. The nuts or screws that retain the tips on soldering irons and guns tend to loosen because 
of the continuous heating and cooling cycles. Therefore, they should be tightened periodically. You 
should never use a soldering gun on electronics components, such as resistors, capacitors, or transistors. 
An advantage of using a resistance soldering iron to solder a wire to a connector is that the soldering tips 
are only hot during the brief period of soldering the connection.
