Information is most effectively represented by electronic
signals or optical signals. Both types of signals can then be
processed conveniently by electronic devices and systems. In
the second half of the twentieth century, the successes in
semiconductor device fabrication and integrated circuits tech-
nologies continued to fuel the development of powerful signal
processing tools that beneﬁt further development of various
technological ﬁelds.
