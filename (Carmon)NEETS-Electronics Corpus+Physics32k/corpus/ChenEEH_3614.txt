The computational complexity of WLS-based algorithms,

(M þ 1)3, where M þ 1 is the length of the ﬁlter. This com-
plexity can be greatly reduced by taking advantage of the

(U T W 2U ) in equation 2.60 and by using an efﬁcient grid
scheme to minimize the number of frequency values. These
simpliﬁcations make the computational complexity of WLS-
