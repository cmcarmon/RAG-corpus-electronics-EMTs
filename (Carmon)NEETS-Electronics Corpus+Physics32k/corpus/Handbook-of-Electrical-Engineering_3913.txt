Although  microstrip  antennas  have  proved  to  be  a  signiﬁcant  advance  in  the  established  ﬁeld  of  antenna
technology,  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  it  is  usually  their  nonelectrical  characteristics  that  make  microstrip
antennas preferred over other types of radiators. Microstrip antennas have a low proﬁle and are light in weight,
they can be made conformal, and they are well suited to integration with microwave integrated circuits (MICs).
If  the  expense  of  materials  and  fabrication  is  not  prohibitive,  they  can  also  be  low  in  cost. When  compared
with traditional antenna elements such as wire or aperture antennas, however, the electrical performance of
the  basic  microstrip  antenna  or  array  suffers  from  a  number  of  serious  drawbacks,  including  very  narrow
bandwidth,  high  feed  network  losses,  poor  cross  polarization,  and  low  power-handling  capacity.  Intensive
research and development has demonstrated that most of these drawbacks can be avoided, or at least alleviated
to  some  extent,  with  innovative  variations  and  extensions  to  the  basic  microstrip  element  [James  and  Hall,
1989; Pozar and Schaubert, 1995]. Some of the basic features of microstrip antennas are listed below:
