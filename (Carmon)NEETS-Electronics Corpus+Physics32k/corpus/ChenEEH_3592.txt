for all integers n and n0. A causal digital ﬁlter is one whose
response does not anticipate the behavior of the excitation
signal. Therefore, for any two input sequences x1(n) and
x2(n) such that x1(n) ¼ x2(n) for n  n0, the correspond-
ing responses of the digital ﬁlter are identical for n  n0;
that is:
