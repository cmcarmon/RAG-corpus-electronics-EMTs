In the one-dimensional case, the velocities are scalars and the equation is either:






v

r
e
l


=
v
−
(
−
w
)


{\displaystyle \,v_{rel}=v-(-w)}
, if the two objects are moving in opposite directions, or:






v

r
e
l


=
v
−
(
+
w
)


{\displaystyle \,v_{rel}=v-(+w)}
, if the two objects are moving in the same direction.
