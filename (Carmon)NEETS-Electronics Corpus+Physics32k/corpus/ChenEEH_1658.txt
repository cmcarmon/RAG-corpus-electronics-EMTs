Level 1 represents systems that model raw image data using
features such as color histogram, shape, and texture descrip-
tors. This model can be used to serve the queries like ‘‘ﬁnd
pictures with dominant red color on a white background.’’
Content-based image indexing and retrieval (CBIR) systems
based on these models operate directly on the data, employing
techniques from the signal processing domain. Level 2 consists
of derived or logical features involving some degree of statis-
tical and logical inference about the identity of objects depicted
by visual media. An example query at this level can be ‘‘ﬁnd
pictures of Eiffel Tower.’’ Using these models, systems normally
operate on low-level feature representation, though they can
also use image data directly. Level 3 deals with semantic
abstractions involving a signiﬁcant amount of high-level
reasoning about the meaning and purpose of the objects or
scenes depicted. An example of a query at this level can be
‘‘ﬁnd pictures of laughing children.’’ As indicated at level 3 of
the ﬁgure, the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) community has had
the leading role in this effort. Systems at this level can take
semantic representation based on input generated at level 2.
