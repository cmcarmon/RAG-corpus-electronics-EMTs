The conditions of a statement can be represented by symbols (variables); for instance, the statement
"Today is payday" might be represented by the symbol P. If today actually is payday, then P is TRUE. If
today is not payday, then P is FALSE. As you can see, a statement has two conditions. In computers,
these two conditions are represented by electronic circuits operating in two LOGIC STATES. These
logic states are 0 (zero) and 1 (one). Respectively, 0 and 1 represent the FALSE and TRUE conditions of
a statement.
