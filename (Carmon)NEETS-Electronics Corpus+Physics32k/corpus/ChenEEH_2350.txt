An important parameter in a rectangular section waveguide is
the attenuation per unit length. The attenuation for propa-
gating modes in a waveguide results from two types of losses:
those due to the dielectric imperfection (dielectric loss ad) and
those due to the Ô¨Ånite conductivity of the waveguide metal
walls (conductor loss ac). The calculation of those losses is
performed considering the time average power lost in the
conducting walls and in the dielectric per unit length. The
resulting expressions for this calculation are reported, respec-
tively, for TE and TM modes as (Collin, 1991):
