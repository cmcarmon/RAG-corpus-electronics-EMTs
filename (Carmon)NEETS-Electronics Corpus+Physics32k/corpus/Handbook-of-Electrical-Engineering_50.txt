Semiconductor resistors can be divided into four types: diffused, bulk, pinched, and ion-implanted. Table 1.3
shows some typical resistor properties for semiconductor resistors. Diffused semiconductor resistors use resis-
tivity of the diffused region in the semiconductor substrate to introduce a resistance in the circuit. Both n-type
and p-type diffusions are used to form the diffused resistor.
