After	completing	this	chapter,	the	student	will	be	
able	to:
Describe	the	phase	relationship	between	current	
and	voltage	in	a	capacitive	AC	circuit.
Determine	the	capacitive	reactance	in	an	AC	
capacitive	circuit.
Describe	how	resistor-capacitor	networks	can	be	
used	for	filtering,	coupling,	and	phase	shifting.
Explain	how	low-pass	and	high-pass	RC	filters	
operate.
