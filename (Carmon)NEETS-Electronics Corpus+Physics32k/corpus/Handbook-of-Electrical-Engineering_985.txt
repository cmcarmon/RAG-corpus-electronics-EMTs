STEP 9. Fit  the  wide-short  device  in  the  subthreshold  region  at  whatever  back-bias  and  drain  voltage  is
appropriate (usually zero back-bias and low Vds ) with parameter NES (subthreshold slope ﬁtting parameter).
One may need to ﬁt with VT0 also and then VT0 is replaced after this step with the value of VT0 obtained
from step 1.
