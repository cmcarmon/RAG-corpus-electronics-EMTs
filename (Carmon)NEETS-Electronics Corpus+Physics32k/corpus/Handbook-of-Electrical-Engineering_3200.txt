FIGURE 30.32 High-frequency resonant converter (half-bridge version) conÔ¨Ågurations suitable for operation above res-
onance. Cn1 and Cn2 are the snubber capacitors. (Note: For operation below resonance, di/dt limiting inductors and RC
snubbers are required. For operation above resonance, only capacitive snubbers are required as shown.) (a) Series resonant
converter. Leakage inductances of the HF transformer can be part of resonant inductance. (b) Parallel resonant converter.
(c) Series-parallel (or LCC-type) resonant converter with capacitor Ct placed on the secondary side of the HF transformer.
