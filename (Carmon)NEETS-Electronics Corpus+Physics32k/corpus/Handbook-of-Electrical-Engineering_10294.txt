The history of satellites began in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I, the world’s ﬁrst satellite. In
the 1960s the commercial sector became actively involved in satellite communications with the launch of  Telstar
 With this type of an orbit, an object 22,753
I by the Bell System followed by the use of a 
miles above the earth will orbit the earth once every 24 hours above the equator, and from the earth’s surface
appear to be stationary. The ﬁrst geostationary orbit was achieved by NASA using a SYNCOM in 1963. The
Communications Satellite Act was signed by the United States Congress in 1962 and created the Communica-
tions Satellite Corporation (COMSAT). This was followed by the formation of INTELSAT, an organization that
is composed of over 120 countries and provides global satellite communication services. In the 1970s, multiple
companies  in  the  private  sector  in  the  United  States  began  to  operate  their  own  domestic  satellite  systems.
Today there are numerous companies providing this service in the United States: e.g., GE Americom, Hughes,
Loral, COMSAT, and American Mobile Satellite Corporation. Other nations such as Canada, Australia, Indo-
nesia, Japan, etc. have their own satellite systems. Several international and regional satellite systems have also
been formed. Examples of these are INTELSAT, EUTELSAT, Intersputnik, ARABSAT, AsiaSat, etc. [Pritchard
