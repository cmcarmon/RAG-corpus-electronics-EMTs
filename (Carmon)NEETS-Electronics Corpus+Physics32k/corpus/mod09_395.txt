Due to some slight difference between the two circuits, one transistor will conduct more than the 
other. Assume that Q1 conducts more than Q2. The increased conduction of Q1 causes the collector 
voltage of Q1 to be less negative (more voltage drop across R1). This decreases the forward bias of Q2 
and decreases the conduction of Q2. When Q2 conducts less, its collector voltage becomes more negative. 
The negative-going change at the collector of Q2 is coupled to the base of Q1 and causes Q1 to conduct 
even more heavily. This regenerative action continues until Q2 is cut off and Q1 is saturated. The circuit 
is in a stable state and will remain there until a trigger is applied to change the state.
