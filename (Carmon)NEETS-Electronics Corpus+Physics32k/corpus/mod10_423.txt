The term waveguide can be applied to all types of transmission lines in the sense that they are all
used to guide energy from one point to another. However, usage has generally limited the term to mean a
hollow metal tube or a dielectric transmission line. In this chapter, we use the term waveguide only to
mean "hollow metal tube." It is interesting to note that the transmission of electromagnetic energy along a
waveguide travels at a velocity somewhat slower than electromagnetic energy traveling through free
space.
