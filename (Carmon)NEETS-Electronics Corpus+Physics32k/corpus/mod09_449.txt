The linear slope that is produced by the circuit is dependent on two variables; (1) the time constant 
of the RC circuit and (2) the gate length of the gate applied to the circuit. The circuit will produce a linear 
sawtooth waveshape if the components selected are such that only one-tenth of 1 TC or less is used. The 
GATE LENGTH is the amount of time that the gate is applied to the circuit and controls the time that the 
capacitor is allowed to charge. The value of R2 and C2 determines the time for 1 time constant
