A typical liquid-cooling system is composed of a PRIMARY LOOP and a SECONDARY LOOP 
(figure 4-16). The primary loop provides the initial source of cooling water and the secondary loop 
transfers the heat load from the electronic equipment to the primary loop. The source of cooling water for 
the primary loop is either sea water from a sea water supply or chilled water from the ship's air-
conditioning plant. The cooling water used in the secondary loop is distilled water. Ultrapure systems are 
maintained by a demineralizer and use double-distilled water obtained through the Navy Supply System.
