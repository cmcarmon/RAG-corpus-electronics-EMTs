Dye-Sensitized Cells
Among the thin-Ô¨Ålm technologies on the near horizon is the dye-sensitized solar cell. The device, illustrated
in Fig. 60.15, utilizes an oxide semiconductor (TiO2) having a bandgap in the 3-eV range that is insensitive to
the solar spectrum. The extension of the photoresponse across the visible portion of the spectrum is achieved
by  separation  of  the  two  steps  of  the  photovoltaic  process.  The  oxide  semiconductor  in  the  electrochemical
system is sensitized by a monolayer of an electroactive dye having an optical absorption band extending across
the width of the visible spectrum. Charge separation occurs by electron loss from the photoexcited dye to the
semiconductor substrate. Following absorption of a photon, the excited state of the dye is such that relaxation
