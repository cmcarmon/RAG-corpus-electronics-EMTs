(e) Instead of the depicted circuit, the square wave is passed through a system that delays its input, which
4 . Use the transfer function
applies a linear phase shift to the signal’s spectrum. Let the delay τ be T
of a delay to compute using Matlab the Fourier series of the output. Show that the square wave is
indeed delayed.
