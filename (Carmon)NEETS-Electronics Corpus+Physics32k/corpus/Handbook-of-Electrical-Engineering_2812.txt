The Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) publishes several professional journals which
describe the broad range of issues related to contemporary VLSI circuits, including the IEEE Journal of Solid-
State  Circuits  and  the  IEEE  Transactions  on  Very  Large  Scale  Integration  Systems.  Other  applications-related
journals  from  the  IEEE  cover VLSI-related  topics.  Representative  examples  include  the IEEE Transactions  on
Signal Processing, the IEEE Transactions on Computers, the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, and the IEEE
Transactions  on  Communications.  Several  conferences  also  highlight VLSI  circuits,  including  the  IEEE  Solid-
State Circuits Conference, the IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference, and several others.
