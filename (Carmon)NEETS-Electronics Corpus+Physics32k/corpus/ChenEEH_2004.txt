Trovo (2002) implemented microrollback in VHDL in the
Motorola 68040 processor along with concurrent error detec-
tion via a watchdog (WD) processor-based control-ﬂow
checking (see Section 8.4) and a two-error detecting one-
error correcting Hamming code (HC) implemented on the
memory and cache data and address busses. Because the
68040 is a CISC processor, an instruction may not be executed
every clock cycle, and an instruction microrollback scheme can
be implemented for the register ﬁle, state registers, cache, and
main memory (the main memory rollback support is similar
to that of the cache) using hardware similar to that described
in Sections 8.5.1–8.5.3.
