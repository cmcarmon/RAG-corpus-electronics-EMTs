These same programs can be fantastic aids to the beginning student of electronics, allowing
the exploration of ideas quickly and easily with no assembly of real circuits required. Of course,
there is no substitute for actually building and testing real circuits, but computer simulations
certainly assist in the learning process by allowing the student to experiment with changes
and see the effects they have on circuits. Throughout this book, Iâ€™ll be incorporating computer
printouts from circuit simulation frequently in order to illustrate important concepts. By ob-
serving the results of a computer simulation, a student can gain an intuitive grasp of circuit
behavior without the intimidation of abstract mathematical analysis.
