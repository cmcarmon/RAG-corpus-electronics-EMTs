The preceding equation contains two other useful functions. The OR func-
tion is represented using ‘‘+’’ and the NOT function using the bar symbol as in
‘‘X ’’ or the ∼ symbol as in ∼ X. For example, we represent the condition ‘‘B
is FALSE’’ as B or ∼ B. We call B the complement of B. The logic operators
that we have seen thus far are summarized in Table 5.2. For convenience, we
will use 1, TRUE, and high interchangeably. Similarly, we will use 0, FALSE,
and low interchangeably.
