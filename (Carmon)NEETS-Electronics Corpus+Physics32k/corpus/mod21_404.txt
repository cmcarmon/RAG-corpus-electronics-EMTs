All frequency counter measurements are measured with 1 part in 108 of accuracy. However, 
frequency counters have provisions for input from external frequency standards. This extends the 
accuracy of the frequency to that of the standard. A frequency self-check capability is provided to 
determine if the counting and lighting circuits are operating properly.
