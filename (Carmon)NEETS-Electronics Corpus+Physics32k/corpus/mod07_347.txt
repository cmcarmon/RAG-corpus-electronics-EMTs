The elements of one type of FET, the junction type (JFET), are compared with the bipolar transistor 
and the vacuum tube in figure 3-44. As the figure shows, the JFET is a three-element device comparable 
to the other two. The "gate" element of the JFET corresponds very closely in operation to the base of the 
transistor and the grid of the vacuum tube. The "source" and "drain" elements of the JFET correspond to 
the emitter and collector of the transistor and to the cathode and plate of the vacuum tube.
