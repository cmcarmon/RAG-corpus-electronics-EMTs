The Republic of India uses one time zone, which is Indian Standard Time (IST). This is UTC+05:30 — that is, five and a half hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. India does not observe daylight saving time (DST or summer time).
The official time signal is given by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory. The IANA time zone database contains only one zone, namely Asia/Kolkata. The date and time notation in India shows some specialties.
Some older time zones were:
Bombay Time (UTC+04:51),
Madras Time (UTC+05:21)
Calcutta Time (UTC+05:54),
Port Blair mean time
During the Sino–Indian War of 1962 and the Indo–Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971, daylight saving was briefly used to reduce civilian energy consumption.
