Discontinuities
The waveguide discontinuities shown in Fig. 39.4(a)–(f) illustrate most clearly the use of E and H ﬁeld distur-
bances to realize capacitive and inductive components. An E-plane discontinuity [Fig. 39.4(a)] can be modeled
approximately  by  a  frequency-dependent  capacitor.  H-plane  discontinuities  [Figs. 39.4(b)  and  (c)]  resemble
inductors as does the circular iris of Fig. 39.4(d). The resonant waveguide iris of Fig. 39.4(e) disturbs both the
E and H ﬁelds and can be modeled by a parallel LC resonant circuit near the frequency of resonance. Posts in
waveguide  are  used  both  as  reactive  elements  [Fig. 39.4(f)]  and  to  mount  active  devices  [Fig. 39.4(g)].  The
equivalent circuits of microstrip discontinuities [Figs. 39.4(k)–(o)] are again modeled by capacitive elements
if the E ﬁeld is interrupted and by inductive elements if the H ﬁeld (or current) is interrupted. The stub shown
in Fig. 39.4(j) presents a short circuit to the through transmission line when the length of the stub is l
g/4. When
the stubs are electrically short (<< l
