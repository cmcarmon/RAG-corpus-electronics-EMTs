2. As mentioned earlier, because most practical receiver circuits are able to correctly interpret values
outside the extremum points (below 0 volts for a logical 0 and above 5 volts for a logical 1), we
concern ourselves with providing for a noise margin only between the output value range and the
forbidden region, and ignore the effect of noise that tends to push a value outside the extremum
bounds.
3. Notice that the signal voltages in the figure are taken with respect to a ground node that is
common to both the sender and the receiver. This ground node that is common to senders and
receivers is often not shown explicitly, but it is always present! Many a novice designer has forgotten
to connect together a common ground between subsystems and has found that the system does
not work. Remember, currents flow in loops and the ground connection provides a return path for
the current.
