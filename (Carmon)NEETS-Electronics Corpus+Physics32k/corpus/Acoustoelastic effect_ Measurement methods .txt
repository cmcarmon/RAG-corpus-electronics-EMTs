To be able to measure the sound velocity, and more specifically the change in sound velocity, in a material subjected to some stress state, one can measure the velocity of an acoustic signal propagating through the material in question. There are several methods to do this but all of them utilise one of two physical relations of the sound velocity. The first relation is related to the time it takes a signal to propagate from one point to another (typically the distance between two acoustic transducers or two times the distance from one transducer to a reflective surface). This is often referred to as "Time-of-flight" (TOF) measurements, and utilise the relation




c
=


d
t




{\displaystyle c={\frac {d}{t}}}

where



d


{\displaystyle d}
is the distance the signal travels and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time it takes to travel this distance. The second relation is related to the inverse of the time, the frequency, of the signal. The relation here is




c
=
f
λ


{\displaystyle c=f\lambda }

where



f


{\displaystyle f}
is the frequency of the signal and



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is the wave length. The measurements using the frequency as measurand utilise the pheonomenon of acoustic resonance where



n


{\displaystyle n}
number of wave lengths match the length over which the signal resonate. Both these methods are dependent on the distance over which it measure, either directly as in the Time-of-flight, or indirectly through the matching number of wavelengths over the physical extent of the specimen which resonate.
