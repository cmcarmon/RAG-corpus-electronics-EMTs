Hz.  The  effect  of  applying  increasing  amounts  of 
negative  feedback  (and  consequently  reducing  the 
gain  to  a  more  manageable  amount)  is  that  the 
bandwidth increases in direct proportion. 
  The frequency response curves in Fig. 8.5 show 
the effect on the bandwidth of  making the closed-
loop  gains  equal  to  10,000,  1,000,  100,  and  10. 
Table  8.3  summarizes  these  results.  You  should 
also  note  that  the  (gain  ×  bandwidth)  product  for 
this amplifier is 1 × 106 Hz (i.e. 1 MHz).  
  We can determine the bandwidth of the amplifier 
when the closed-loop voltage gain is set to 46 dB 
by constructing a line and noting the intercept point 
on 
the 
bandwidth  will  be  10  kHz.  Note  that,  for  this 
operational  amplifier, 
the  (gain  ×  bandwidth) 
product is 2 × 106 Hz (or 2 MHz).
