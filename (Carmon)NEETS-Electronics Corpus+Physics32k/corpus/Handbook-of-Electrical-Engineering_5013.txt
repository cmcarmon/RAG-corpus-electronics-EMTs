where t is the time to breakdown under an electric stress E, B is a constant, and n is an exponent parameter.
The relationship is essentially empirical in nature, and its proof of validity rests primarily on experiment and
observation. It is found that a single type of electrically induced aging process will generally result in a straight-
line relationship between log t and log E. Consequently, aging data obtained at higher electrical stresses with
correspondingly shorter times to breakdown when extrapolated to longer times at stresses in the vicinity of the
operating stress should yield the value of the effective service life under the operating stress. The slope of the
line determines the exponent n, which constitutes an approximate indicator of the type of aging involved. For
example, with polymer insulation water treeing ordinarily results in n values less than 4, while under conditions
that may involve discharges and electrical trees, the n values may approach 10 or greater.
