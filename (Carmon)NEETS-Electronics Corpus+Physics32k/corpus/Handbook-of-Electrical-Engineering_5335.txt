The  photogenerated  minority  carriers  must  diffuse  to  the  junction  to  be  collected.  These  carriers  will
recombine as a function of the distance that they travel in accordance with the following formula n = n0ex/L,
where x is the distance traveled and L is the diffusion length for the minority carrier.
