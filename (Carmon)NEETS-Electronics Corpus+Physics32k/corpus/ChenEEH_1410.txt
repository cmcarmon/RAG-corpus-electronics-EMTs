Page and Luk (1991) describe a hardware compiler for high-
level sequential programs augmented with language constructs
for parallel operation and communication. This method en-
ables the rapid production of a wide variety of designs, from
pipelined video operators to instruction-set processors. The
approach is being extended to cover designs involving run-
time reconÔ¨Åguration.
