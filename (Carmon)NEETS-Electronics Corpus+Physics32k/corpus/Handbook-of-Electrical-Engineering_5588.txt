Inverse-Time Characteristic
Overcurrent relays sense the magnitude of the current in the
circuit,  and  when  it  exceeds  a  preset  value  (known  as  the
pickup setting of the relay), the relay closes its output contact,
energizing the trip coil of the appropriate circuit breakers. The
pickup setting must be set above the largest load current that
the circuit may carry and must be smaller than the smallest
fault current for which the relay must operate. A margin factor
of  2  to  3  between  the  maximum  load  on  the  one  hand  and
the minimum fault current on the other and the pickup setting
of  the  relay  is  considered  to  be  desirable.  The  overcurrent
relays usually have an inverse-time characteristic as shown in
Fig. 61.41. When the current exceeds the pickup setting, the
relay  operating  time  decreases  in  inverse  proportion  to  the
current  magnitude.  Besides  this  built-in  feature  in  the  relay
mechanism, the relay also has a time-dial setting, which shifts
the inverse-time curve vertically, allowing for more ï¬‚exibility in setting the relays. The time dial has 11 discrete
settings, usually labeled 1/2, 1, 2, . . ., 10, the lowest setting providing the fastest operation. The inverse-time
characteristic offers an ideal relay for providing primary and backup protection in one package.
