Letâ€™s assume we are applying two variables, X and Y, to the inputs of an OR gate. For the circuit to
produce a HIGH output, either variable X, variable Y, or both must be HIGH. The Boolean expression for
this operation is f = X+Y and is spoken "f equals X OR Y." The plus sign indicates the OR function and
should not be confused with addition.
