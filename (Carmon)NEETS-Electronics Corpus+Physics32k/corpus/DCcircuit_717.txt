An 1/8 watt resistor would work just ﬁne for R4, a 1/2 watt resistor would sufﬁce for R3
and a 5 watt for R2 (although resistors tend to maintain their long-term accuracy better if
not operated near their rated power dissipation, so you might want to over-rate resistors R2
and R3), but precision 50 watt resistors are rare and expensive components indeed. A custom
resistor made from metal stock or thick wire may have to be constructed for R1 to meet both
the requirements of low resistance and high power rating.
