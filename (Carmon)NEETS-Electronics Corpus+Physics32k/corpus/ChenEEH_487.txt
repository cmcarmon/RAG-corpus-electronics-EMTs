characterizing the high-
frequency performance of a transistor are discussed next. For
those frequencies of f that are not too high, the small-signal
current gain in common-emitter (CE) conÔ¨Åguration (i.e.,
E-grounded with the signal applied to either B or C) can be
described quite accurately as a function of frequency by:
