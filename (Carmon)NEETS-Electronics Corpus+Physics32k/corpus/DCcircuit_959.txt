So, I1 is 5 amps, I2 is 4 amps, and I3 is a negative 1 amp. But what does “negative” current
mean? In this case, it means that our assumed direction for I3 was opposite of its real direction.
Going back to our original circuit, we can re-draw the current arrow for I3 (and re-draw the
polarity of R3’s voltage drop to match):
