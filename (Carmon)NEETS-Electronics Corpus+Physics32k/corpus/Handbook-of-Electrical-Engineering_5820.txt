Distribution is the last section of the electrical power system. Figure 65.1 shows the major components of the
electric power system. The power plants convert the energy stored in the fuel (coal, oil, gas, nuclear) or hydro
into electric energy. The energy is supplied through step-up transformers to the electric network. To reduce
energy transportation losses, step-up transformers increase the voltage and reduce the current. The high-voltage

network, consisting of transmission lines, connects the power plants and high-voltage 
The  typical  voltage  of  the  high-voltage  transmission  network  is  between  240  and  765  kV.  The  high-voltage
substations  are  located  near  the  load  centers,  for  example,  outside  a  large  town.  This  network  permits  load
sharing among power plants and assures a high level of reliability. The failure of a line or power plant will not
interrupt the energy supply.
