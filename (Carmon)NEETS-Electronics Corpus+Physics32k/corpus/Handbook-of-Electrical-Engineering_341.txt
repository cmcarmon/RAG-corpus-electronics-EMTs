The  energy  which  is  transmitted  into  the  network  over  some  interval  of  time  is  found  by  integrating  the
power over this interval. If the area under the positive part of the power curve were the same as the area under
the negative part, the net energy transmitted over one cycle would be zero. For the values of a and b used in
the ﬁgure, however, the positive area is greater, so there is a net transmission of energy toward the network.
The energy ﬂows back from the network to the source over part of the cycle, but on the average, more energy
ﬂows toward the network than away from it.
