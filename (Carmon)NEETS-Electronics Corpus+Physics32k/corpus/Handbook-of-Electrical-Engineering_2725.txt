To  reduce  the  complexity  of  restricted  routers,  this  type  of  router  often  uses  a  rectangular  grid  on  which
trunks (horizontal wire segments) and branches (vertical wire segments) are placed on different layers. In other
words,  the  layers  supported  by  the  technology  are  divided  into  two  groups,  horizontal  and  vertical.  This  is
known as the Manhattan model. On the other hand, in a non-Manhattan model, the assignment of a layer to
a vertical or horizontal direction is not enforced. Given the freedom of direction, assignment to layers reduces
the channel width and vias in many cases; the latter model usually produces a better result than the former.
