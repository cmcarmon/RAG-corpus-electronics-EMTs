This chapter Ô¨Årst provides an overview of MEMS. The
sequential steps in their production are then reviewed, namely
design, simulation, fabrication, packaging, and testing. The
reliability of MEMS is considered from the viewpoint of their
performance in actual applications. The applications of micro-
machined static MEMS, micromechanical MEMS sensors and
actuators, and functional MEMS systems are also surveyed.
Examples of MEMS use in the transportation, communication,
analytical, and medical industries are provided. The Appendix
at the end of this chapter lists more than 30 books on MEMS
that have been published in the past decade.
