The left column of Figure 4.5 shows the covariance analysis
using the method of Section 4.5.2 for a scenario where the
position aiding is available at 1 Hz for the ﬁrst 60 sec but not
available for the subsequent 15 sec. In the ﬁrst 60 sec the
position and velocity error standard deviations (STDs) have
effectively reached their steady-state accuracy. These plots
clearly show that error accumulates during each 1 sec of INS
integration and is reduced by each 1 Hz position update. The
accelerometer bias error is still being slowly corrected at the
end of the 60 sec of position corrections.
