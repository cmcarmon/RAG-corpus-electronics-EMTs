Least-Squares Curve Fitting (Analytical)
We begin this section by showing how to do least-squares curve ﬁtting by analytical solutions, using a simple
example to illustrate the method. We then mention least-squares curve ﬁtting using numerical solutions in the
next section. We can only ﬁnd analytical solutions to simple problems. The more complex ones must rely on
numerical techniques.
