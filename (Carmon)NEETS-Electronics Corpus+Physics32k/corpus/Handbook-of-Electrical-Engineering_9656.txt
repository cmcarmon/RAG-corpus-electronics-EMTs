While  the  interface  to  computers  has  changed  and  the  use  to  which  we  apply  computer  technology  has
changed, there will always be the need for an operating system. Without question, the OS will change as well.
We  have  already  seen  micro-kernel  architectures  begin  to  emerge  from  the  research  labs  into  commercial
operating systems. Distributed computing will become more widespread and force additional changes to the
operating system. Regardless of the changes that come, it will always be the operating system on which all other
programs rely.
