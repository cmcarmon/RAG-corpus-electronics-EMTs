with 0.1” spacing between terminals for use in a solderless breadboard. 
These SPDT switches can double as on/off switches in your circuits. You 
may also want to buy a few pushbutton (momentary on) switches. If you 
think you might enclose one or more projects in a box and you’d like a 
robust front‐panel on/off control, pick up a couple of SPST (single‐pole, 
single‐throw) switches, such as an SPST mini rocker switch. For a little 
more money, you can get a mini rocker switch with a built‐in LED that 
lights up when the switch is in the on position. (Chapter 4 provides 
details on switches.)
