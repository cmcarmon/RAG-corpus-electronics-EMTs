An elementary model of a two-winding core-type transformer is shown in Figure 1.2.12.
Essentially it consists of two windings interlinked by a mutual magnetic ﬁeld. The winding that
is excited or energized by connecting it to an input source is usually referred to as the primary
winding, whereas the other, to which the electric load is connected and from which the output
energy is taken, is known as the secondary winding. Depending on the voltage level at which
the winding is operated, the windings are classiﬁed as HV (high voltage) and LV (low voltage)
windings. The terminology of step-up or step-down transformer is also common if the main
purpose of the transformer is to raise or lower the voltage level. In a step-up transformer, the
primary is a low-voltage winding whereas the secondary is a high-voltage winding. The opposite
is true for a step-down transformer.
