Pseudo-random testing: A technique that uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) or similar structure to
generate binary test patterns with statistical distribution of values (0 and 1) across the bits; these patterns
are  generated  without  considering  the  implementation  structure  of  the  circuit  to  which  they  will  be
applied.
