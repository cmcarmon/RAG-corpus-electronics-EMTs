The semi major axis (



a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
) is not immediately visible with an hyperbolic trajectory but can be constructed as it is the distance from periapsis to the point where the two asymptotes cross. Usually, by convention, it is negative, to keep various equations consistent with elliptical orbits.
The semi major axis is directly linked to the specific orbital energy (



ϵ



{\displaystyle \epsilon \,}
) or characteristic energy

{\displaystyle C_{3}}
of the orbit, and to the velocity the body attains at as the distance tends to infinity, the hyperbolic excess velocity (

Note that the total energy is positive in the case of a hyperbolic trajectory (whereas it is negative for an elliptical orbit).
