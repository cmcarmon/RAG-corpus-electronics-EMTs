A connection of water pipes that has no leaks is a physical analogy of this situation. The net rate at which
water is ﬂowing into a joint of two or more pipes must equal the net rate at which water is ﬂowing away from
the joint. The joint itself has the property that it only connects the pipes and thereby imposes a structure on
the ﬂow of water, but it cannot store water. This is true regardless of when the ﬂow is measured. Likewise, the
nodes of a circuit are modeled as though they cannot store charge. (Physical circuits are sometimes modeled
for  the  purpose  of  simulation  as  though  they  store  charge,  but  these  nodes  implicitly  have  a  capacitor  that
provides the physical mechanism for
