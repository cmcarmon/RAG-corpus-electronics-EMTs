Due to the limited precision with which floating point numbers are stored in computers, the exact expression is in practice not accurate for large distances. The approximation

{\displaystyle BJD_{TT}=JD_{TT}+{\frac {{\vec {r}}\cdot {\hat {n}}}{c}}+{\frac {{\vec {r}}\cdot {\vec {r}}-({\vec {r}}\cdot {\hat {n}})^{2}}{2\,c\,d}}}

is accurate for large distances. It should be used if the object is beyond the Solar System and if also millisecond accuracy is required.
