2-37. When the leads of an ohmmeter are 
placed across a resistor, that resistor adds 
to the internal series coil resistance of the 
meter.  The pointer is deflected to the left 
of its full-scale position, giving a reading 
in ohms for the resistor being tested.  
Which of the following reasons explains 
why the pointer moves to less than full-
scale?
