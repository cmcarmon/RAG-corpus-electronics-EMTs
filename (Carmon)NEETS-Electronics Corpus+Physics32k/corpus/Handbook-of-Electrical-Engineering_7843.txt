a region whose temperature has passed a certain critical value, Tcri t , then one can explain the crescent shape
of  these  domains  in  the  following  way:  With  the  laser  operating  in  the  CW  mode  and  the  disk  moving  at
constant velocity, temperature distribution in the magnetic medium assumes a steady-state proﬁle, such as that
shown in Fig. 80.31(c). Of course, relative to the laser beam, the temperature proﬁle is stationary, but in the
frame of reference of the disk the proﬁle moves along the track with the linear track velocity. The isotherm
corresponding  to Tcrit  is  identiﬁed  as  such  in  the  ﬁgure;  within  this  isotherm  the  magnetization  aligns  itself
with the applied ﬁeld. Figure 80.31(d) shows a succession of critical isotherms along the track, each obtained
at the particular instant of time when the magnetic ﬁeld switches direction. From this picture it is easy to infer
how the crescent-shaped domains form and also understand the relation between the waveform that controls
the magnet and the resulting domain pattern.
