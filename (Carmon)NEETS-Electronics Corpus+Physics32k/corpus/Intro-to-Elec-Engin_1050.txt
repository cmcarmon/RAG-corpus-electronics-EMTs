For generators it is the volt–ampere, or voltage–load, characteristics. For machines in general,
it is also vital to know the limits between which characteristics can be varied and how to obtain
such variations. Relevant economic features, such as efﬁciency, power factor, relative costs, and
the effect of losses on heating and machine rating, need to be investigated.
