The	LED	That	Fades	is	a	project	that	produces	and	sometimes,	blinking
lights.	It	operates	according	to	the	weakness	or	strength	of	the	signals	that
are	interpreted	by	each	of	its	components.	If	its	IC	timer,	transistor,	resistor,
and	capacitor	receive	strong	signals;	the	LED	will	glow;	conversely,	if	they
receive	weak	signals,	the	light	starts	to	fade.	In	the	event	that	the	signals
that	are	submitted	are	unstable	(i.e.	they	alternate	between	weak	or	strong
in	a	few	minutesâ€™	time),	the	blinking	pattern	comes	in.
