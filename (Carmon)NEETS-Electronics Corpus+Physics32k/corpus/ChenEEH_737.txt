The previous subsections have shown which factors inï¬‚uence the
memory cost. The memory cost increases when a higher memory
bandwidth is needed (see Subsection 2.5.2). The memory sub-
system, however, is not the only cost for the complete system.
Data path is not always neglectable. Moreover, communicating
tasks or threads make the problem more complex.
