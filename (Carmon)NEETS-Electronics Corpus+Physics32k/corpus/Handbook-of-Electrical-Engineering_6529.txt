Predistortion  requires  less  circuit  complexity  than  feedforward.  A  carefully  designed  nonlinear  circuit  is
placed before the nonlinear modulator, such that the combined transfer function of the predistorter-modulator
is  linear.  Various  nonlinear  electronic  devices  or  circuits  can  act  as  second-  or  third-order  predistorters.
DifÔ¨Åculties include matching the frequency dependence of the predistorter with that of the modulator, hence
achieving  good  linearity  over  a  wide  frequency  range.  Numerous  circuit  designs  can  provide  reductions  in
third-order distortion by 15 dB.
