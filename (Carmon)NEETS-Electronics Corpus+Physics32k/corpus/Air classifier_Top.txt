An air classifier is an industrial machine which separates materials by a combination of size, shape, and density.
It works by injecting the material stream to be sorted into a chamber which contains a column of rising air. Inside the separation chamber, air drag on the objects supplies an upward force which counteracts the force of gravity and lifts the material to be sorted up into the air. Due to the dependence of air drag on object size and shape, the objects in the moving air column are sorted vertically and can be separated in this manner.
Air classifiers are commonly employed in industrial processes where a large volume of mixed materials with differing physical characteristics need to be separated quickly and efficiently. One such example is in recycling centers, where various types of metal, paper, and plastics arrive mixed together and need to be sorted before further processing can take place.
