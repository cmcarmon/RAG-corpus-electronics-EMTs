FPGAs have become the favored choice in implementing
glue logic, experimental systems, and hardware prototypes
because of advantages such as short turnaround time, user
reconﬁgurability, and low development costs. However, there
are area and time overheads for providing conﬁgurable logic,
conﬁgurable storage, and conﬁgurable routing resources.
