Observe that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the conductances
connected directly to node 1 or 2, while the off-diagonal terms are the
negatives of the conductances connected between the nodes. Also, each
term  on  the  right-hand  side  of  Eq.  (3.21)  is  the  algebraic  sum  of  the
currents entering the node.
