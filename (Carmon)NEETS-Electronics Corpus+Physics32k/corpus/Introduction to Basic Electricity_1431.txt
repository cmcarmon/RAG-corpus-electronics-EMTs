Electrons, with their negative charge, represent the 
charge carrier in an electric circuit. Therefore,  electric 
current is the flow of negative charges.  Scientists 
and engineers once thought that current flowed in 
a  direction opposite to electron flow. Later work 
 revealed that the movement of an electron from one 
atom to the next created the appearance of a positive 
charge, called a hole, moving in the opposite  direction 
(Figure 11-2 and Figure 11-3). Electron movement 
and current were found to be the same.
