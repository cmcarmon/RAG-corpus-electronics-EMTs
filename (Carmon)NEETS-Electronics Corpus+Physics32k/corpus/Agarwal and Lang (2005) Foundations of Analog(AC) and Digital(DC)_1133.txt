let us determine the operating point of the MOSFET
amplifier for its bias voltages using the large-signal SCS circuit model depicted
in Figure 8.15. Assuming that the input bias voltage is VI, we can determine the
output operating current ID and the output operating voltage VO. We explicitly
show the power supply voltage source VS to facilitate deriving the small-signal
model.
