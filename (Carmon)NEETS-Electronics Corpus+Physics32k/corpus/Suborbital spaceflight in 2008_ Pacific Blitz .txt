On 1 November, the US Navy conducted two tests of the AEGIS missile defence system as part of the Pacific Blitz naval exercise. Two target missiles were launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Barking Sands. SM-3 interceptors were launched from the USS Paul Hamilton and USS Hopper. The missile launched from the Paul Hamilton successfully intercepted its target, however the one launched from the Hopper failed to do so, due to a targeting fault.
