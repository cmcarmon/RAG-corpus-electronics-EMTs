Let us carry the diode-
resistor example of Figure 4.16 and Figure 4.20 a step further, and allow the driving
voltage to be a sinusoid rather than DC. That is, let vI = Eo cos(Ï‰t). Also, for reasons
that will become evident, let us calculate the voltage across the resistor rather than the
diode voltage. The graphical solution is no different than before, except that now we
must solve for the voltage assuming a succession of values of vI, and visualize how the
resultant time waveform should appear.
