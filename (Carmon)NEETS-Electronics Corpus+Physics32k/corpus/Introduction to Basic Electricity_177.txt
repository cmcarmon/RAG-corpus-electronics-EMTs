The	smallest	part	of	a	multimeter’s	scale	is	called	as	the	resolution.	It	is
responsible	for	achieving	an	accurate	reading	and	interpretation.	In	many
multimeter	kinds,	especially	digital	ones,	it	can	be	configured	or	calibrated.	And,
as	the	rules	go,	a	device	with	low	resolution	doesn’t	require	much	completion
time;	a	device	with	high	resolution	can	require	a	demanding	processing	time.
Meanwhile,	the	accuracy	of	a	multimeter	refers	to	an	error	in	the	measurement	of
an	electric	current,	in	comparison	to	a	perfect	reading.	It	is	relative	to	the	device’s
resolution	since	resolution	may	not	be	calibrated	accordingly	if	the	absolute
accuracy	level	is	questionable.	Therefore,	to	determine	the	total	accuracy	of	a
multimeter,	its	relative	accuracy	should	be	added	to	its	absolute	accuracy.
Formula	for	the	computation	of	total	accuracy:
**representations:														TA	=	total	accuracy
