the dc signals into audio tone-shift signals. These signals are then patched to the transmitter section of the 
transceiver through the transmitter transfer switchboard. The audio tone-shift signals modulate the rf 
carrier generated by the transmitter (xmtr). The rf tone-modulated signals are then radiated by the 
antenna.
