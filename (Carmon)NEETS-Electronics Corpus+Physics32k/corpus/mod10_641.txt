Most radiators emit (radiate) stronger radiation in one direction than in another. A radiator such as 
this is referred to as ANISOTROPIC. An example of an anisotropic radiator is an ordinary flashlight. The 
beam of the flashlight lights only a portion of the space surrounding it. If a circle is drawn with the 
flashlight as the center, as shown in view B of figure 4-11, the radiated light can be measured at different 
positions around the circle. Again, as with the isotropic radiator, all positions are the same distance from 
the center, but at different angles. However, in this illustration the radiated light is measured at 16 
different positions on the circle.
