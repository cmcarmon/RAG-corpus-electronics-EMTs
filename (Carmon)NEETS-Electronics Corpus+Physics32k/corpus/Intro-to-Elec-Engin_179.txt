The mesh-current method deals routinely with voltage sources. When we have current
sources with shunt conductances, the source-transformation technique may be used effectively to
convert the current source to a voltage source. However, in cases where we have constrained
meshes, that is, the two mesh currents are constrained by a current source, the concept of
a supermesh becomes useful for the circuit analysis, as shown in the following illustrative
example.
