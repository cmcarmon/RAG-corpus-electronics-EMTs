At T1, the input gate ends and Q1 begins to conduct heavily. C2 discharges through R3 and Q1. The 
time required to discharge C2 is primarily determined by the values of R3 and C2. The minimum 
discharge time (in this circuit) is 500 microseconds (5KΩ × .02µF × 5). At T2, the capacitor has 
discharged back to 0 volts and the circuit is quiescent. It remains in this condition until T3 when another 
gate is applied to the transistor.
