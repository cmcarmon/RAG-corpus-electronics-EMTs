Table  5.2  summarizes  the  result  of  the  digital-to-analog  conversion.
Note that we have assumed that each bit has a value of 0.125 V. Thus,
in this system, we cannot represent a voltage between 1.000 and 1.125,
for example. This lack of resolution is a major limitation of digital-to-
analog conversions. For greater accuracy, a word representation with a
greater  number  of  bits  is  required.  Even  then  a  digital  representation
of  an  analog  voltage  is  never  exact.  In  spite  of  this  inexact  represen-
tation,  digital  representation  has  been  used  to  accomplish  remarkable
things such as audio CDs and digital photography.
