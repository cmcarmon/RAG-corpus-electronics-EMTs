I’ve given you some detailed procedures for the first 
project, so work through that one first. Then, you 
should be able to follow the circuit schematics and 
build the rest of the projects on your own. Check 
Chapter 11 if you need a refresher on schemat-
ics, and browse through Chapter 3 if you’d like to 
review basic circuit concepts. And if the projects 
don’t seem to work as advertised (it happens to the 
best of us), review Chapter 16, arm yourself with a 
multimeter, and start troubleshooting!
