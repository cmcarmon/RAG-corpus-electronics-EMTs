These equations show that, in the active mode, the BJT can be modeled
as a dependent current-controlled current source. Thus, in circuit analy-
sis, the dc equivalent model in Fig. 3.40(b) may be used to replace the
npn transistor in Fig. 3.40(a). Since 
in Eq. (3.32) is large, a small base
current  controls  large  currents  in  the  output  circuit.  Consequently,  the
bipolar transistor can serve as an ampliﬁer, producing both current gain
and voltage gain. Such ampliﬁers can be used to furnish a considerable
amount of power to transducers such as loudspeakers or control motors.
