The problem of determining an optimal clock skew schedule for
a fully synchronous VLSI system is considered in this section
from the perspective of improving system reliability. An original
formulation of the clock skew scheduling problem by the
authors is introduced as a constrained quadratic programming
(QP) problem (Kourtev and Friedman, 1999a, 1999b).
