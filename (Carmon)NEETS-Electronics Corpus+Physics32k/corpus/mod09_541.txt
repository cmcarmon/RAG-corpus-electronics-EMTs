As the positive alternation of the input signal is applied (T0), the output voltage follows the input 
signal. From T1 to T2 the input signal is more positive than + 4 volts. The diode is forward biased and 
conducts. At this time the output voltage equals the bias voltage and limiting takes place. From T2 to T4 
of the input signal, the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. The output signal follows the input 
signal and no limiting takes place.
