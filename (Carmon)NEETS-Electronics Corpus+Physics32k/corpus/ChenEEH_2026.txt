g (h(u)):¼ f (u)]. Since errors in h(u) are caught precisely, the
error coverage will still increase and the false alarm rate will
reduce in checking f vis-a-vis just by applying the ﬂoating
point checksum test to f. This type of a combined mantissa
and ﬂoating point checksum is called a hybrid checksum.
