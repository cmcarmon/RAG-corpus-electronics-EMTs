The AAL protocols are subdivided into two parts. The lower part performs, at the sending side, the segmen-
tation  of  long  messages  into  the  cell  payload  and,  at  the  receiving  side,  reassembly  into  long  messages.  The
upper part is service dependent and provides the AAL service to the higher layer.
