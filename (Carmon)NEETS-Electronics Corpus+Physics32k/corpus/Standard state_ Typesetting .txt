At the time of development in the nineteenth century, the superscript Plimsoll symbol was adopted to indicate the non-zero nature of the standard state. IUPAC recommends in the 3rd edition of Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry a symbol which seems to be a degree sign (°) as a substitute for the plimsoll mark. In the very same publication the plimsoll mark appears to be constructed by combining a horizontal stroke with a degree sign. A range of similar symbols are used in the literature: a stroked lowercase letter O (o), a superscript zero (0) or a circle with a horizontal bar either where the bar extends the boundaries of the circle (U+29B5 ⦵ Circle with horizontal bar) or is enclosed by the circle, dividing the circle in half (U+2296 ⊖ Circled minus). When compared to the plimsoll symbol used on vessels, the horizontal bar should however extend the boundaries of the circle.
