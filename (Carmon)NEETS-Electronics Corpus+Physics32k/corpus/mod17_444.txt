Radiation. Energy is beamed directly from the transmitting antenna, or source, to the victim 
receiving antenna. When this interference is picked up by a receiver, you have two solutions. 
Interfering energy can be eliminated at the source or you can filter, or blank it out at the victim 
equipment. Filtering is far less desirable. Interference may be on the same frequency as the desired 
signal and will not be eliminated without affecting the reception of all desired signals.
