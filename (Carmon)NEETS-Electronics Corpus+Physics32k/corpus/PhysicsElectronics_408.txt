An important use of diodes is to suppress the voltage surge present when an inductive load
is switched out of a circuit – inductive surge suppression. With inductors it is not possible
to turn oﬀ the current suddenly since the inductor will try to keep the current ﬂowing when
the switch is opened. A diode in a DC circuit or back-to-back zener diodes in an AC circuit
can be used to shunt the inductor and prevent it from conducting.
