kVA, 2400:480 V, following the notation of Fig-
ure 11.3.4, the equivalent circuit impedances in
ohms are R1 = 0.06, R2 = 0.003, RC = 2000,
and X1 = 0.3, X2 = 0.012, Xm = 500. The
load connected across the low-voltage terminals
draws rated current at 0.8 lagging power factor
with rated voltage at the terminals.
