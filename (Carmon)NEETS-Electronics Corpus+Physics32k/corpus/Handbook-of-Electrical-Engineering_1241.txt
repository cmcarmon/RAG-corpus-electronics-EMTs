of the matrix. For example, an m ·  n Toeplitz matrix is completely speciﬁed by the m + n – 1 elements of its
ﬁrst row and ﬁrst column. We now formalize this concept.
Deﬁnition 2. Let aij(q1, q2, …, qp) for 1 £ i £ m and 1 £ j £ n designate a set of mn functions that are dependent
on a set of real-valued parameters q1, q2, …, qp in which p < mn. Furthermore, consider the matrix A ˛  Cm · n
whose elements are given by
