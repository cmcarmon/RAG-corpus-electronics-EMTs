In the context of a worldwide military communications network, satellite communications systems 
are very important. Satellite communications links add capacity to existing communications capabilities 
and provide additional alternate routings for communications traffic. Satellite links, as one of several 
kinds of long-distance links, interconnect switching centers located strategically around the world. They 
are part of the defense communication systems (DCS) network. One important aspect of the satellite 
communications network is that it continues in operation under conditions that sometimes render other 
methods of communications inoperable. Because of this, satellites make a significant contribution to 
improved reliability of Navy communications.
