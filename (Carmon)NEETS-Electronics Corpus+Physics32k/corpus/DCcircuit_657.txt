The task of the meter designer is to take a given meter movement and design the necessary
external circuitry for full-scale indication at some speciÔ¨Åed amount of voltage or current. Most
meter movements (electrostatic movements excepted) are quite sensitive, giving full-scale indi-
cation at only a small fraction of a volt or an amp. This is impractical for most tasks of voltage
and current measurement. What the technician often requires is a meter capable of measuring
high voltages and currents.
