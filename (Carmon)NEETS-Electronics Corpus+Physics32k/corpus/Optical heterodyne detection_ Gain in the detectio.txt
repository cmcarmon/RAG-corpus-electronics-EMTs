The amplitude of the down-mixed difference frequency can be larger than the amplitude of the original signal itself. The difference frequency signal is proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the LO and signal electric fields. Thus the larger the LO amplitude, the larger the difference-frequency amplitude. Hence there is gain in the photon conversion process itself.

{\displaystyle I\propto \left[E_{\mathrm {sig} }\cos(\omega _{\mathrm {sig} }t+\varphi )+E_{\mathrm {LO} }\cos(\omega _{\mathrm {LO} }t)\right]^{2}\propto {\frac {1}{2}}E_{\mathrm {sig} }^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}E_{\mathrm {LO} }^{2}+2E_{\mathrm {LO} }E_{\mathrm {sig} }\cos(\omega _{\mathrm {sig} }t+\varphi )\cos(\omega _{\mathrm {LO} }t)}

The first two terms are proportional to the average (DC) energy flux absorbed (or, equivalently, the average current in the case of photon counting). The third term is time varying and creates the sum and difference frequencies. In the optical regime the sum frequency will be too high to pass through the subsequent electronics. In many applications the signal is weaker than the LO, thus it can be seen that gain occurs because the energy flux in the difference frequency
