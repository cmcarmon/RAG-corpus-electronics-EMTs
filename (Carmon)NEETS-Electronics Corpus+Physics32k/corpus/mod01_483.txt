Resistors of the same resistance value are available in different wattage values. Carbon resistors, for
example, are commonly made in wattage ratings of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, and 2 watts. The larger the physical
size of a carbon resistor the higher the wattage rating. This is true because a larger surface area of material
radiates a greater amount of heat more easily.
