Let



Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}
be the length of a piece of string,



m


{\displaystyle m}
its mass, and



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
its linear density. If the horizontal component of tension in the string is a constant,



T


{\displaystyle T}
, then the tension acting on each side of the string segment is given by

{\displaystyle T_{2x}=T_{2}\cos(\beta )\approx T.}

If both angles are small, then the tensions on either side are equal and the net horizontal force is zero. From Newton's second law for the vertical component, the mass of this piece times its acceleration,



a


{\displaystyle a}
, will be equal to the net force on the piece:

{\displaystyle \Sigma F_{y}=T_{1y}-T_{2y}=-T_{2}\sin(\beta )+T_{1}\sin(\alpha )=\Delta ma\approx \mu \Delta x{\frac {\partial ^{2}y}{\partial t^{2}}}.}

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mu \Delta x}{T}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}y}{\partial t^{2}}}=-{\frac {T_{2}\sin(\beta )}{T_{2}\cos(\beta )}}+{\frac {T_{1}\sin(\alpha )}{T_{1}\cos(\alpha )}}=-\tan(\beta )+\tan(\alpha )}

The tangents of the angles at the ends of the string piece are equal to the slopes at the ends, with an additional minus sign due to the definition of alpha and beta. Using this fact and rearranging provides

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\Delta x}}\left(\left.{\frac {\partial y}{\partial x}}\right|^{x+\Delta x}-\left.{\frac {\partial y}{\partial x}}\right|^{x}\right)={\frac {\mu }{T}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}y}{\partial t^{2}}}}

In the limit that



Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta x}
approaches zero, the left hand side is the definition of the second derivative of

This is the wave equation for

, and the coefficient of the second time derivative term is equal to

{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {T \over \mu }},}

where



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the speed of propagation of the wave in the string. (See the article on the wave equation for more about this). However, this derivation is only valid for vibrations of small amplitude; for those of large amplitude,



Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}
is not a good approximation for the length of the string piece, the horizontal component of tension is not necessarily constant, and the horizontal tensions are not well approximated by



T


{\displaystyle T}
