The local oscillator output frequency must be tunable over a range of several megahertz in the 4,000-
megahertz region. The local oscillator must compensate for any changes in the transmitted frequency and
maintain a constant 30 or 60 megahertz difference between the oscillator and the transmitter frequency. A
local oscillator that can be tuned by varying the applied voltage is most desirable.
