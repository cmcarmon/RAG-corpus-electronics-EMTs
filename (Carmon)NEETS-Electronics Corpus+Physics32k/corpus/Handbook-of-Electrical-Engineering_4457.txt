In this section we have brieﬂy described the performance of microwave and millimeter wave solid state circuits.
Currently the discrete silicon bipolar transistors, IMPATT diodes, and GaAs MESFETs are most widely used in
solid state circuits and bipolar transistors, and IMPATT diodes are still the most powerful solid state sources
below S-band and 10 to 300 GHz, respectively. The MESFET is the workhorse for microwave circuits up to 40
GHz. The HEMT applications are similar to the MESFET, including ampliﬁers, oscillators, frequency multipli-
ers,  mixers,  and  control  circuits,  and  above  50  GHz,  this  device  is  exclusively  used  for  power  and  low-noise
ampliﬁers. The HBTs applications include high-efﬁciency ampliﬁers, ultrabroadband dc ampliﬁers, low-noise
oscillators, frequency multipliers, and mixers.
