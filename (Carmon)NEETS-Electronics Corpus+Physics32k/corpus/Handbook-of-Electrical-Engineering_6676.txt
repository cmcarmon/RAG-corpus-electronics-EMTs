There  is  signiÔ¨Åcant  debate  over  whether  the  efforts  of  the  ISO/OSI  community  are  leading  to  the  best
standards (or even standards that have any merit whatever!). Limiting our discussion to the ISORM is, by no
means, an endorsement of the actual protocols that have been developed in the ISO arena; there are actually
more widely deployed and successful standards in other arenas. On the other hand, the ISORM is very useful
for discussing network architecture principles, and these principles apply across the board. Thus, we choose to
base our discussion on the ISORM.
