A  robotic  arc  welding  cell  provides  several  advantages  over  manual  welding  operations.  These  advantages
include higher productivity as measured by “arc-on” time, elimination of worker fatigue, decreased idle time,
and improved safety. It is also important to correct upstream production operations to reduce variations. This
is best accomplished during the design and installation phase of a robotic welding cell. During this phase, issues
to consider include delivery of materials to the cell, ﬁxtures and welding positioners, methods required for the
processes, and any production and inventory control problems related to the efﬁcient utilization and operation
of the cell.
