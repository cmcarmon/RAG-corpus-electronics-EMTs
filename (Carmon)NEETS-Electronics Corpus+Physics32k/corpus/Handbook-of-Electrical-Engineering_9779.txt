Dr. Goddard was instrumental in developing rocket propulsion in this country, both solid-fuel rocket
engines and later liquid-fuel rocket motors used in missile and spaceﬂight applications. Goddard died
in 1945, before this pivotal patent (ﬁled June 23, 1941) on automatic control of liquid-fuel rockets was
granted. He assigned half the rights to the Guggenheim Foundation in New York. (Copyright © 1995,
