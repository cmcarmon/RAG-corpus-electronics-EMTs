Piezoelectric Smart Materials
Piezoelectric smart materials 
ﬁnd applications primarily in intelligent structures deploying electroelastic syn-
ergism, and a class of ceramics (popularly known as ferroelectric ceramics) have emerged in recent times for
,
such  applications.  Typically,  such  ceramics  include  the  base  polycrystalline  piezoelectrics  such  as  BaTiO
3
, formulated with various stoichiometric proportions. Another class of piezoelec-
CdTiO
3
 and
tric ﬂexible composite that has the potential for smart applications is a compound consisting of PbTiO
3
SiO3,  Li2Si2O5,
chloroprene  rubber. A  set  of  glass  ceramic  composites  containing  the  crystalline  phases  of  Li
2
Ba2TiSi2O8, Ba2TiGe2O8, Li2B4O7, etc. are also emerging samples in smart material engineering [Chong et al., 1990].
Piezoelectric smart materials can also be made from the family of polymers, namely, polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
(PVDF). The main advantages of using this polymer are that it can be formed into very thin sheets and has
excellent mechanical strength combined with high sensitivity to pressure changes.
