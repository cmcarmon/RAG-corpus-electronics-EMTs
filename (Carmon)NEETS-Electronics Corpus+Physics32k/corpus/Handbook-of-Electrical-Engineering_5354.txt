For better materials utilization, thin-ﬁlm Si has always been of keen interest to the photovoltaics community.
Early work in this area was limited to cells having efﬁciencies in the 5% regime, much below expectations. With
the evolution of better cell engineering and understanding of Si deposition, higher efﬁciencies have been realized.
Among these are a 20.6% (CVD of Si on Si) 47 µm thick active layer, a 47 µm thinned Si cell (CVD of Si on
Si) with efﬁciency of 21.5%, and a PERL structure. However, the economy of these cells is not expected to meet
large-scale  production  requirements  in  their  current  technologies.  (Figure 60.10  presents  some  structures  of
advanced thin-ﬁlm Si designs.) They serve as indicators that high efﬁciencies can be reached with thin-Si layers.
The economy of ﬁlms of Si requires high-performance and low-cost materials, process, and production methods.
AstroPower Silicon-Film™ solar cells have reached 16.6%. This thin-Si solar cell represents a ﬁrst-phase com-
mercial design. Other more advanced designs are also illustrated in Fig. 60.10.
