This  completes  the  DC  characterization  steps  for  the  MOS  level  3  model.  One  would  then  go  on  to  do  the
junction and overlap capacitance terms (discussed later). Note that this model has no parameters for Ô¨Åtting
over temperature, although temperature dependence is built into the model that the user cannot control.
