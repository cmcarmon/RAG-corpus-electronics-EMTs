Registered ASICs
Developments in application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs) and ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)
over  recent  years  have  provided  digital  system  designers  with  a  wide  range  of  ﬂexible  devices  which  can  be
programmed for the speciﬁc job in hand. The vast majority of digital subsystems involve sequential logic to a
greater or lesser extent, and the array manufactures have provided most devices with registers at either input
or output and, sometimes, at both. The Altera EP512 is a good example, and its input structure is shown in Fig. 81.40.
The device has eight programmable inputs in which each may be conﬁgured as any one of the following:
