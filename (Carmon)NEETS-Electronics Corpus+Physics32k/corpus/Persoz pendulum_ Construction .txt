The pendulum consists of balls which rest on the coating under test and form the fulcrum. The Persoz pendulum is very similar to the Konig pendulum. Both employ the same principle, that is the softer the coating the more the pendulum oscillations are damped and the shorter the time needed for the amplitude of oscillation to be reduced by a specified amount. The two pendulums differ in shape, mass and oscillation time, and there is no general relationship between the results obtained using the two pieces of equipment. In either case, the test simply involves noting the time in seconds for the amplitude of swing to decrease from either 6 to 3 degrees (Konig pendulum) or 12 to 4 degrees (Persoz pendulum).
