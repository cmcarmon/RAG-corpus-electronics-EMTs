The specific angular momentum of any conic orbit, h, is constant, and is equal to the product of radius and velocity at periapsis. At any other point in the orbit, it is equal to:




h
=
r
v
cos
⁡

ϕ

,



{\displaystyle h=rv\cos {\phi },\,}

where φ is the flight path angle measured from the local horizontal (perpendicular to r.) This allows the calculation of φ, knowing radius and velocity at any point in the orbit:




ϕ
=
arccos
⁡

(




r

p



v

p




r
v



)




{\displaystyle \phi =\arccos {({\frac {r_{p}v_{p}}{rv}})}\,}

Note that flight path angle is a constant 0 degrees (90 degrees from local vertical) for a circular orbit.
