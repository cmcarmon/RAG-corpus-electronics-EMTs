Distance relays may be used to protect a transmission line by
taking the input measurements from only one end of the line.
Another approach is to connect two distance relays to per-
form the relaying as a system by exchanging the data between
the relays from two ends through a communication link. In this
case, it is important to decide what information gets exchanged
and how is it used. The logic that describes the approach is
called a relaying scheme. Most common relaying schemes are
based on the signals sent by the relay from one end causing
either blocking and unblocking or facilitating and accelerating
of the trip from the relay at the other end. In all of the men-
tioned applications, directionality of a distance relay is an
important feature. It will be discussed in more detail later on.
