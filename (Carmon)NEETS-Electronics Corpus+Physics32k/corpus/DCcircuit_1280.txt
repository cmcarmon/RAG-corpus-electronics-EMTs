When capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of the individual
capacitors’ capacitances. If two or more capacitors are connected in parallel, the overall effect
is that of a single equivalent capacitor having the sum total of the plate areas of the individual
capacitors. As we’ve just seen, an increase in plate area, with all other factors unchanged,
results in increased capacitance.
