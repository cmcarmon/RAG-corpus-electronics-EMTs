the center of the vertical axis. Because the electron beam is still moving horizontally, electron 3 will
appear to the right of and above electron 2. At time 4 (T4), the sine wave applied to the top vertical-
deflection plate is at its maximum positive value. This attracts electron 4 toward the top deflection plate.
The upward deflection of electron 4 is increased by the negative-going sine wave (at time 4) applied to
the bottom deflection plate. This negative voltage repels electron 4 upward. Thus, electron 4 strikes the
CRT face to the right of and above electron 3. Finally, at time 5 (T5) both input sine waves are again at
zero volts. As a result, electron 5 is not deflected vertically, only horizontally. (Remember, the beam is
continually moving from right to left.)
