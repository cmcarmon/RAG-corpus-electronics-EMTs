just the right instant to provide good character registration. Third, it must have a short impact time. The impact
force and energy are determined by the kinetic energy transferred by the hammer; this is the main factor in
determining the amount of ink transfer to the paper. The hammer energy is typically 4–8 mJ. The total time
from electronic print impulse to impact with the ribbon/paper set must be closely controlled to achieve good
character registration, increasing in importance with band loop speed. The ﬂight time variance must not be
more than 1.7 ms to yield a print registration error of no greater than 0.05 mm with a loop speed of 30 m/s.
This can best be done by automatically and periodically measuring the time to impact (using a piezoelectric
impact  bar)  and  then  making  microcode/electronic  impulse  delay  adjustments.  To  minimize “slur”  (i.e.,  the
blurring of a character caused by lateral relative motion between the engraved character and the ribbon/paper
set  during  impact),  short  impact  time  is  important.  It  may  be  shown  that  this  impact  time  is  inversely
proportional to the square root of the hammer mass (for given hammer kinetic energy), and inversely propor-
tional to the hammer velocity (for given ribbon/paper set thickness and compliance). For a given amount of
acceptable slur, the hammer velocity must increase proportional to the band loop velocity, and the hammer
mass (for ﬁxed kinetic energy) must decrease—inversely proportional to the square of the band loop velocity.
