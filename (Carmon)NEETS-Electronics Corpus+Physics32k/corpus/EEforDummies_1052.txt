components  —  most  notably  capacitors  and 
inductors.  These  variations  can  change  the 
way a circuit behaves. Keep this fact in mind 
if  you’re  working  with  RF  (radio  frequency) 
circuits, such as radio receivers and transmit-
ters, with digital circuits that use signals that 
change at a very fast rate (on the order of a 
couple of million Hertz), and with more sensi-
tive timing circuits that rely on exact component  
values.
If you’re building a radio or other circuit that 
stray capacitance can affect, you may have to 
forego the step of first building the circuit on a 
solderless breadboard. Instead, you may have 
to go straight to a perfboard (described in the 
section “Creating a Permanent Circuit,” later in 
this chapter).
