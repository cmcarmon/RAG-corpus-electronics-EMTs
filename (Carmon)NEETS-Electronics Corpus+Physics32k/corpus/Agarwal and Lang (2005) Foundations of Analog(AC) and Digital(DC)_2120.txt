Now we are in a position to find an analytical relation between vo and vi for
the circuit in Figure 15.4. We replace the Op Amp by the linear model in
Figure 15.6, as shown in Figure 15.7, then analyze this linear circuit by the
methods of Chapter 3. The voltage variables defined in Figure 15.7 are in fact
the node variables for the circuit, so we can use the node method to derive
three independent expressions relating the three unknown voltages.
