Pilot Protection
Pilot protection of transmission lines uses communication channels (pilot channels) between the line terminals
as an integral element of the protection system. In general, pilot schemes may be subdivided into categories
according to the medium of communication used. For example, the pilot channels may be wire pilots, leased
telephone circuits, dedicated telephone circuits, microwave channels, power line carriers, or ﬁber optic channels.
Pilot  protection  schemes  may  also  be  categorized  according  to  their  function,  such  as  a  tripping  pilot  or  a
blocking pilot. In the former, the communication medium is used to send a tripping signal to a remote line
terminal,  while  in  the  latter,  the  pilot  channel  is  used  to  send  a  signal  that  prevents  tripping  at  the  remote
terminal  for  faults  outside  the  zone  of  protection  of  the  relays.  The  power  line  carrier  system  is  the  most
common system used in the United States. It uses a communication channel with a carrier signal frequency
ranging  between  30  and  300 kHz,  the  most  common  bands  being  around  100 kHz.  The  modulated  carrier
signal is coupled into one or more phases of the power line through coupling capacitors. In almost all cases,
the capacitors of the capacitive-coupled voltage transformers are used for this function (see Fig. 61.46). The
carrier signal is received at both the sending and the receiving ends of the transmission line by tuned receivers.
The carrier signal is blocked from ﬂowing into the rest of the power system by blocking ﬁlters, which are parallel
resonant circuits, known as wave traps.
