it is also possible to model the complete operation of the
MOSFET (for any value of vGS) using a more sophisticated nonlinear model.
This results in the Switch Unified (SU) model, which is discussed further in
Section 7.8. Although the SU model captures the complete characteristics of
the MOSFET, for simplicity, we will focus on the SR and the SCS models.
Accordingly, unless specifically mentioned otherwise, we will use the SR model
for the triode region of the MOSFET when analyzing digital systems (since we
work with a fixed high value of vGS, where vGS ≥ VT and vDS < vGS − VT),
and the SCS model in the saturation region (vGS ≥ VT and vDS ≥ vGS − VT)
for analog systems.
