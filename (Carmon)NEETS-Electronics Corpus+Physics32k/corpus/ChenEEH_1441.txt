Despite the rapid progress made in the last 10 years, many
consider conﬁgurable computing still in its infancy (Mangione-
Smith et al., 1997). As described earlier, there is active research
in many aspects of conﬁgurable computing: modeling, appli-
cations, tools, architectures, platforms, and implementation
technology.
