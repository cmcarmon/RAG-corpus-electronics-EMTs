Remote operation: Magnetic locks can be turned on and off remotely by adjusting the power source.
Easy to install: Magnetic locks are generally easier to install than other locks since there are no interconnecting parts.
Quick to operate: Magnetic locks unlock instantly when the power is cut, allowing for quick release in comparison to other locks.
Sturdy: Magnetic locks may also suffer less damage from multiple blows than do conventional locks. If a magnetic lock is forced open with a crowbar, it will often do little or no damage to the door or lock. There are no moving parts in an electromagnetic lock to break.
