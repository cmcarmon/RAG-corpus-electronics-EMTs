Since Hn ∩ Vn ⊂ V1, any point that is in Λ under iteration must land in the left vertical strip A of V1, or on the right vertical strip B. The lower horizontal strip of H1 is the image of A and the upper horizontal strip is the image of B, so H1 = f(A) ∪ f(B). The strips A and B can be used to label the four squares in the intersection of V1 and H1:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Lambda _{A\bullet A}&=f(A)\cap A\\\Lambda _{A\bullet B}&=f(A)\cap B\\\Lambda _{B\bullet A}&=f(B)\cap A\\\Lambda _{B\bullet B}&=f(B)\cap B\end{aligned}}}

The set ΛB•A consist of points from strip A that were in strip B in the previous iteration. A dot is used to separate the region the point of an orbit is in from the region the point came from.
The notation can be extended to higher iterates of the horseshoe map. The vertical strips can be named according to the sequence of visits to strip A or strip B. For example, the set ABB ⊂ V3 consists of the points from A that will all land in B in one iteration and remain in B in the iteration after that:




A

{
x

A

.


{\displaystyle ABB=\{x\in A\,|\,f(x)\in B\,\,\,\mathrm {and} \,\,\,f_{2}(x)\in B\}.}

Working backwards from that trajectory determines a small region, the set ABB, within V3.
The horizontal strips are named from their vertical strip pre-images. In this notation, the intersection of V2 and H2 consists of 16 squares, one of which is

{\displaystyle \Lambda _{AB\bullet BB}=f_{2}(AB)\cap BB.}

All the points in ΛAB•BB are in B and will continue to be in B for at least one more iteration. Their previous trajectory before landing in BB was A followed by B.
