FIGURE 40.26 Measured and calculated voltages at the east and west ends of a 450-m line for both line ends open. Although
the direction to the lightning as determined from the ratio of the two magnetic ﬂux density (B) components was 40(cid:176), as
shown in Fig. 40.29(a), the best calculated ﬁt to the data was found for 65(cid:176) as shown, the angular error apparently being
caused by variation in the magnitudes of the magnetic ﬂux density components due to nearby conductors as determined
from comparing azimuths computed from the B’s and from a commercial lightning location system (LLP). (Source: Adapted
