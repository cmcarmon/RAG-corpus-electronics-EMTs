Electronic components (such as resistors) can stand only so much heat (just 
how much depends on the size and type of component) before they have a 
meltdown. Because heat is a form of energy, and power is a measure of the 
energy consumed over a period of time, you can use the power rating of an 
electronic component to tell you how many watts (what? Watts, abbreviated 
W, are units of electric power) a component can safely handle.
