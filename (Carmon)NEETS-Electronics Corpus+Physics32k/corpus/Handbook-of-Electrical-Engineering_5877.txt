FIGURE 66.6 A block diagram depicting
a  qualitative  relationship  among  various
electrical  and  mechanical  quantities  of  a
synchronous machine. ea , eb , ec are phase
voltages;  ia ,  ib ,  ic  phase  currents;  iF  rotor
Ô¨Åeld  current; q  relative  position  of  rotor;
w deviation of rotor speed from synchro-
nous  speed;  Pin  mechanical  power  input.
The  state  variables  appear  in  Eqs.  (66.1)
and (66.2).
