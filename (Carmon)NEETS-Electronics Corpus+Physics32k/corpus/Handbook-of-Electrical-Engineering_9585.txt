Feng’s classiﬁcation [Hwang and Briggs, 1984] was originally intended for parallel processors, and as a result,
the number of CUs in a computer system was not speciﬁed. Händler extended Feng’s classiﬁcation by adding
a third dimension, namely, the number of CUs. Pipelined systems are also included in this classiﬁcation through
additional parameters [Händler, 1977].
