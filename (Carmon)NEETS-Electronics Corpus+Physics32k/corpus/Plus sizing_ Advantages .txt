Larger tires improve handling and cornering, due to wider tread faces and stiffer sidewalls.
Wider tires may decrease braking distances on dry pavement.
Wider tires may also increase acceleration, especially in very powerful vehicles such as muscle cars.
Larger wheels with lower profile tires are sometimes aesthetically or culturally desirable.
