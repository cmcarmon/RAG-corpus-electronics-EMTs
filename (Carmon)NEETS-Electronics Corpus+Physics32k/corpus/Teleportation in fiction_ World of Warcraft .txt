Within the MMORPG World of Warcraft, characters can use an object called a "Hearthstone" to teleport the character to an inn to which the hearthstone is set. Characters can change the inn to which they "hearth" (as it is often called in-game) by visiting another inn and asking an innkeeper to make that inn their home.
Users can also create trinkets to teleport them to the regions of Tanaris, Winterspring, Netherstorm, Blade's Edge Mountains, and most Northrend areas through the use of the "Engineering" profession. Various "mishaps" can happen, including temporary gender or race change, arriving dead or even ending up on a floating rock high above Area 52 (Netherstorm).
Some classes have the ability to teleport to certain places, for example, Druids can teleport to Moonglade by use of an ability.
Mages can create portals to capital cities that everyone in the party can access. Also mages can teleport themselves to the capital cities.
Warlocks can summon others with the help of group members.
Meeting stones now work like warlocks summoning spells, without the use of a soul shard.
Rogues also have a form of teleportation, Shadow step, an ability that makes the rogue appear behind an enemy.
