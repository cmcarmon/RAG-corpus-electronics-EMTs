You should treat heat exhaustion victims as if they were in shock. Loosen the clothing, apply cool 
wet cloths, move the victim to either a cool or an air-conditioned area, and fan the victim. Do not allow 
the person to become chilled. If the victim is conscious, administer a solution of 1 teaspoon of salt 
dissolved in a quart of cool water. If the victim vomits, do not give any more fluids. Transport the victim 
to a medical facility as soon as possible.
