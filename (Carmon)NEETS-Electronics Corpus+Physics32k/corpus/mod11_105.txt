A three-cavity klystron is illustrated in figure 2-8. The entire DRIFT-TUBE ASSEMBLY, the three 
CAVITIES, and the COLLECTOR PLATE of the three-cavity klystron are operated at ground potential 
for reasons of safety. The electron beam is formed and accelerated toward the drift tube by a large 
negative pulse applied to the cathode. MAGNETIC FOCUS COILS are placed around the drift tube to 
keep the electrons in a tight beam and away from the side walls of the tube. The focus of the beam is also 
aided by the concave shape of the cathode in high-powered klystrons.
