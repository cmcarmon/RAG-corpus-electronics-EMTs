The input voltage may increase or decrease. This 
causes the current through the zener diode to  increase 
or decrease accordingly. When the zener diode is 
 operating in the zener voltage, or breakdown region, a 
large current flows through the zener, with an  increase 
in input voltage. However, the zener voltage remains 
the same. The zener diode opposes an increase in 
 input voltage, because when the current increases, 
the resistance drops. This allows the zener output 
voltage of the zener diode to remain constant as the 
 input  voltage changes. The change in the input volt-
age  appears across the series resistor. The resistor is in 
series with the zener diode, and the sum of the voltage 
drop must equal the input voltage. The output voltage 
is taken across the zener diode.
