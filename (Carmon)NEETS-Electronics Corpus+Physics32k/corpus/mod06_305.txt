Figure 2-5 shows the cross section of the power pentode. Notice that there is no staggered grid
arrangement. Instead, each grid wire is directly in line with the grid in front of and behind it. The screen
and suppressor grids are shielded from the electron stream by the control grid. Because the screen grid is
"shielded" by the control grid, it can draw little grid current from the electron stream.
