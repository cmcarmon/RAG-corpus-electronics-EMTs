Time  average: Any  real  function  g(t)  of  time  has  average  value  gave  on  the  interval  [a,b]  such  that  the
rectangular area gave(b – a) is equal to the area under the curve between a and b, i.e., gave = [1/(b – a)]
*
b g(t)dt. The time average of a sample function x(t) is the limit of its average value over [0,T] as T goes
a
to inﬁnity.
