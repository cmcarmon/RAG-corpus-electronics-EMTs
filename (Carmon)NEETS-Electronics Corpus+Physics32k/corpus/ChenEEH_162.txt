Plot of the group delay for the ﬁlter in Figure 4.12 is in Figure
4.14. We see that the amplitude response approximates fairly
well a constant in the passband, but the group delay has a large
peak. Not every program has a built-in evaluation of the group
delay, but there is a remedy: every computer has a polynomial
root-ﬁnding routine. We can calculate the poles and zeros and
use the second formula in equation 4.18. Let there be M zeros
