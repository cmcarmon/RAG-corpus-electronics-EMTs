Analysis indicated the signal resulted from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes (BBH) with 30.5+5.7
−3.0 and 25.3+2.8
−4.2 times the mass of the Sun, at a distance of 540+130
−210 megaparsecs (1.8+0.4
−0.7 billion light years) from Earth. The resulting black hole had a mass of 53.2+3.2
−2.5 solar masses, 2.7+0.4
−0.3 solar masses having been radiated away as gravitational energy. The peak luminosity of GW170814 was 3.7+0.5
−0.5×1049 W.
