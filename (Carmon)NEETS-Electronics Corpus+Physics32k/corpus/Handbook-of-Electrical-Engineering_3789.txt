Waveguide Modes
Any  structure  that  guides  electromagnetic  waves  can  be  considered  a  waveguide.  Most  often,  however,  this
term refers to closed metal cylinders that maintain the same cross-sectional dimensions over long distances.
Such a structure is shown in Fig. 37.7, which consists of a metal cylinder ﬁlled with a dielectric. When ﬁlled
with low-loss dielectrics (such as air), waveguides typically exhibit lower losses than transmission lines, which
makes  them  useful  for  transporting  RF  energy  over  relatively  long  distances.  They  are  most  often  used  for
frequencies ranging from 1 to 150 GHz.
