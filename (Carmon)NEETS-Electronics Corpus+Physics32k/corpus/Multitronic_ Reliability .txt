Despite its smoothness and improved fuel efficiency there have been numerous reports from owners around the world that the multitronic transmission is prone to electronic glitches and mechanical issues especially for models using clutch pack with six plates built before or around 2006. Typical symptoms include flashing gear selector (PRNDS indicator) on the dashboard, hesitation and/or shudder during acceleration, unable to select reverse gear etc. Although Audi recommends a transmission fluid change at 55,000 and 115,000 kilometres (or 35,000 and 75,000 miles), there are cases that transmission failures still occurred even with recommended fluid changes.
