High-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT.  The high-frequency small-signal equivalent
circuit model of a BJT is quite similar to its high-frequency large-signal equivalent circuit model. In the small-
signal  model,  however,  in  addition  to  the  base  resistance  rb,  the  emitter  and  collector  resistances,  re  and  rc,
respectively, are added to the circuit. The emitter resistance is usually very small because of high emitter doping
used to obtain better emitter injection efÔ¨Åciency. Therefore, whereas at large signal strengths the effect of re is
overshadowed by the base resistance, at small signal strengths this emitter resistance cannot be neglected. The
collector  resistance  becomes  important  in  the  linear  region,  where  the  collector-emitter  voltage  is  low.  The
high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. 22.28.
