Procedure 
 
Start the Z80 Simulator (see Fig. 11.14) then select 
Tools  and  Assembler  and  enter  the  assembly 
language code shown in Fig. 11.15. When complete 
select File and Save your assembly language source 
code with a suitable name (e.g. switch.asm). 
  Next  select  Tools  and  Assemble.  Correct  any 
errors  in  the  assembly  language  source  code  and 
repeat the process until the source code assembles 
without  error.  Save  the  final  assembly  code  and 
then  quit  the  assembler  in  order  to  return  to  the 
main IDE screen. 
  Select File and Load Program and then select the 
object code (switch.obj) that has just been produced 
by the assembler. You will then need to configure 
the  input  and  output  ports  before  you  run  the 
program.  You  can  do  this  by  selecting  Tools  and 
Peripheral Devices (see Fig. 11.16). Configure the 
peripheral devices so that the input port address is 
80H and the output port address to 82H. Then set 
some of the input bits by clicking on the indicators 
(which will change colour).
