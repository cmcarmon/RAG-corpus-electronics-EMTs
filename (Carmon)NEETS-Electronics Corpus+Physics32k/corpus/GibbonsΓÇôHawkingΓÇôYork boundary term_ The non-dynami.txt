, its variation with respect to




g

β




{\displaystyle g_{\alpha \beta }}
gives zero and so does not effect the field equations, its purpose is to change the numerical value of the action. As such we will refer to it as the non-dynamical term.
Let us assume that

{\displaystyle g_{\alpha \beta }}
is a solution of the vacuum field equations, in which case the Ricci scalar
