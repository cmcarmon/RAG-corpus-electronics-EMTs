As can be expected, tidal energy conversion is very site-speciÔ¨Åc. The largest tidal power plant is the single-
basin scheme at La Rance in Brittany, France. It is rated at 240 MW and employs 24 vane-type horizontal turbines
and alternator motors, each rated at 10 MVA. The plant has been in operation since 1966 with good technical
and  economic  results.  It  has  generated,  on  the  average,  around  500  GWh  of  net  energy  per  year.  The  Severn
estuary in the southwest of England and the Bay of Fundy in the border between the United States and Canada
with the highest known tidal range of 17 m have been extensively studied for tidal power generation. There are
several other possible sites around the world, but the massive capital costs required have delayed their exploitation.
