Steel-string guitars vary in construction and materials. Different woods and approach to bracing affect the instrument's timbre or "tone". Many players and luthiers believe a well-made guitar's tone improves over time. Decrease in the content of hemicellulose, crystallization of cellulose, and changes to lignin over time all result in its wood gaining better resonating properties.
