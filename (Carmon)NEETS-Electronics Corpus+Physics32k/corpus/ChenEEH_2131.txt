An early application of electromagnetics is on radio detec-
tion and ranging known as radar, which is an interdisciplinary
subject
involving communications, signal processing, and
propagation. Chapter 10 discusses the principle of both pulsed
and CW radar systems and radar parameters. Specialized
radars for various applications are also addressed, including
MTI radar, Doppler radar, tracking radar, high cross-range
resolution radar, and synthetic aperture radar. An inverse
scattering problem is to reconstruct or recover physical or
geometric properties of an object from measured electromag-
netic Ô¨Åelds. The basic principles of inverse scattering are also
discussed in this chapter. The approach based on an integral
equation formulation in conjunction with an iterative scheme
to solve the inverse scattering is also discussed.
