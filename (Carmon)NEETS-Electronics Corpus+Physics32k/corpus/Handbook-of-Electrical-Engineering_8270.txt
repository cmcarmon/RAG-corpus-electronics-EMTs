 methods [see Fig. 85.1(b)]. In the former,
each output word from the circuit is tested during normal operation. In the latter, the circuit must suspend
normal operation and enter a “test mode,” at which time the appropriate method of testing is applied. While
off-line testing
 can be executed either through external testing (a tester machine external to the circuitry) or
) usually implies that the circuit contains
through the use of BIST, 
some coding scheme which has been previously embedded in the design of the circuitry.
