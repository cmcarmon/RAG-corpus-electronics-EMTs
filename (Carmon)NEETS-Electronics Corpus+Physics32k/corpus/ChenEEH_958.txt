To gain further insight into the proposed algorithms, the
numerical constants of the leading terms in the polynomial
run time complexity expressions are plotted versus k in Figure
4.10. Similarly, the numerical constants of the leading terms in
the polynomial memory complexity expressions are plotted
versus k in Figure 4.11. Note that algorithm CSD outperforms
both of the other two LMCS algorithms where the superiority of
algorithm CSD is particularly evident with respect to the speed
of execution. Thus, algorithm CSD is the algorithm of choice for
solving problem QP-3 as introduced in Section 5.4.3.
