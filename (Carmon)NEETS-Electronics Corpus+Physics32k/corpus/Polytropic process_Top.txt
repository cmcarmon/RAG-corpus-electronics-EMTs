A polytropic process is a thermodynamic process that obeys the relation:




p

V


n


=
C


{\displaystyle pV^{\,n}=C}

where p is the pressure, V is volume, n is the polytropic index , and C is a constant. The polytropic process equation can describe multiple expansion and compression processes which include heat transfer.
If the ideal gas law applies, a process is polytropic if and only if the ratio (K) of energy transfer as heat to energy transfer as work at each infinitesimal step of the process is kept constant:
