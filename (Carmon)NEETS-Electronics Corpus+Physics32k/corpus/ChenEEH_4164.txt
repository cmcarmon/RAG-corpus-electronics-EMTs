. A digital transmission system has higher capacity. Time
division multiplexing (TDM) instead of frequency di-
vision multiplexing (FDM) is used in a digital transmis-
sion system. TDM shares the entire bandwidth by all
users, and the waste of bandwidth can be reduced to a
minimum. The granularity for a time slot is also more
ï¬‚exible than a subfrequency of an FDM. Therefore, the
bandwidth utilization is much higher for a digital trans-
mission system, allowing digital CTAV to accommodate
more than 100 channels.
