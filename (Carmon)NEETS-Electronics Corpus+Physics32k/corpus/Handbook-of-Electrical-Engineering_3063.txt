When the desired ﬁlter function has been determined, the corresponding electronic circuit must be designed.
Many different circuits can be used to realize any given transfer function. For purposes of this handbook, we
present several of the most popular types of realizations. Much more detailed information on various circuit
realizations and the advantages of each may be found in the literature, in particular Van Valkenburg [1982],
Huelseman and Allen [1980], and Chen [1986]. Generally the design trade-offs in making the choice of circuit
to be used for the realization involve considerations of the number of elements required, the sensitivity of the
circuit to changes in component values, and the ease of tuning the circuit to given speciﬁcations. Accordingly,
limited information is included about these characteristics of the example circuits in this section.
