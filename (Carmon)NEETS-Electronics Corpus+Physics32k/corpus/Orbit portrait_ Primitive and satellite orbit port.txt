Other than the zero portrait, there are two types of orbit portraits: primitive and satellite. If



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the valence of an orbit portrait





P




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}}
and



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the recurrent ray period, then these two types may be characterized as follows:
Primitive orbit portraits have



r
=
1


{\displaystyle r=1}
and



v
=
2


{\displaystyle v=2}
. Every ray in the portrait is mapped to itself by




f

n




{\displaystyle f^{n}}
. Each




A

j




{\displaystyle A_{j}}
is a pair of angles, each in a distinct orbit of the doubling map. In this case,




r


P





{\displaystyle r_{\mathcal {P}}}
is the base point of a baby Mandelbrot set in parameter space.
Satellite orbit portraits have



r
=
v
â‰¥
2


{\displaystyle r=v\geq 2}
. In this case, all of the angles make up a single orbit under the doubling map. Additionally,




r


P





{\displaystyle r_{\mathcal {P}}}
is the base point of a parabolic bifurcation in parameter space.
