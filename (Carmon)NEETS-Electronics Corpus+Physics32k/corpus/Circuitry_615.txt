roughly 
follows  the  peak  of  the  half-cycles  of  rectified 
voltage.  R1 and  C2 form  a  simple  filter  circuit  to 
remove  unwanted  RF  signal  components  (this 
circuit works in just the same way as the smoothing 
filter that we met in Chapter 6â€”see pages 117 and 
118).  The  final  result  is  a  voltage  waveform 
appearing  across  C2 that  resembles  the  original 
modulating signal. As well as a providing a current 
path  for D1, R2 forms a discharge path for  C1 and 
C2. Coupling capacitor, C3, is used to remove any 
d.c. component from the signal that appears at the 
output  of  the  demodulator.  Waveforms  for  the 
demodulator circuit are shown in Fig. 13.16. Figure 
13.17 shows a complete IF amplifier together with 
an AM demodulator stage. Circuits of this type are 
used in simple superhet receivers.
