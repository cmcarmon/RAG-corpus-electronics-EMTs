Manual  control  of  a  lighting  system  is  often  the  least  expensive,  but  also  the  least  effective  alternative.
Automatic controls vary from a simple timer to a sophisticated computer system. Figure 107.7 shows a typical
programmable lighting control scheme. A price versus beneÔ¨Åt cost analysis will be required for each installation.
The system should be programmed for normal operation and have a local manual override. A good convenient
practice is to have lights switched in distributed groups so that areas can be lighted or darkened as conditions change.
