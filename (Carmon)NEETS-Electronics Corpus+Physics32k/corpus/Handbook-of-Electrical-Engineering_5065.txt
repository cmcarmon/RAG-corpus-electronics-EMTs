The most commonly used force sensor is the strain gage. It consists of metal wires which are stretched in
response to a force. The resistance of the wire changes as it undergoes strain, i.e., a change in length, since the

 length/cross-sectional area. The wire’s resistivity is a bulk property of
resistance of a wire is 
the  metal  which  is  a  constant  for  constant  temperature.  For  example,  a  strain  gage  can  be  used  to  measure
acceleration by attaching both ends of the wire to a cantilever beam, with one end of the wire at the attached
beam end and the other at the free end. The cantilever beam free end moves in response to an applied force,
such as the force due to acceleration which produces strain in the wire and a subsequent change in resistance.

The sensitivity of a strain gage is described by the unitless gage factor, 
gage factors typically range from 2 to 3. Semiconductors are known to exhibit piezoresistivity, which is a change
in resistance in response to strain which involves a large change in resistivity in addition to the change in linear
dimension.  Piezoresistors  have  gage  factors  as  high  as  130.  Piezoresistive  strain  gages  are  frequently  used  in
microsensors,
