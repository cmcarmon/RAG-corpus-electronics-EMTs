The direction of rotation of a dc motor depends on the direction of the magnetic field and the 
direction of current flow in the armature. If either the direction of the field or the direction of current flow 
through the armature is reversed, the rotation of the motor will reverse. However, if both of these factors 
are reversed at the same time, the motor will continue rotating in the same direction. In actual practice, 
the field excitation voltage is reversed in order to reverse motor direction.
