More recently developed heterojunction LEDs (Fig. 83.5) offer two mechanisms to improve LED efﬁciencies
[Yang,  1988].  The  electron  injection  efﬁciency  can  be  enhanced,  but,  in  addition,  absorption  losses  through
the wider 2.1-eV bandgap n-type layer are essentially eliminated for photons emitted by recombination in the
lower 2.0-eV bandgap p-type region.
