The ideal rocket equation, or the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, can be used to study the motion of vehicles that behave like a rocket (where a body accelerates itself by ejecting part of its mass, a propellant, with high speed). It can be derived from the general equation of motion for variable-mass systems as follows: when no external forces act on a body (Fext = 0) the variable-mass system motion equation reduces to

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{\mathrm {rel} }{\frac {\mathrm {d} m}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {v} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}

If the velocity of the ejected propellant, vrel, is assumed have the opposite direction as the rocket's acceleration, dv/dt, the scalar equivalent of this equation can be written as

where m0 is the initial total mass, including propellant, m1 is the final total mass, vrel is the effective exhaust velocity (often denoted as ve), and Δv is the maximum change of speed of the vehicle (when no external forces are acting).
