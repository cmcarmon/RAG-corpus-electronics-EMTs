the straight summation, delay-and-sum, and weighted delay-and-sum types. The geometrical distribution of
sensors and the weights wi associated with each sensor are crucial factors in the shaping of the Ô¨Ålter character-
istics. In the case of a linear array of N equispaced sensors, which are spaced D units apart, starting at the origin
x1 = 0, the function
