Until now, youâ€™ve learned about magnetic tape recording from an analog point-of-view. That is, the
signal you record and reproduce is the actual analog input signal waveform. In digital magnetic tape
recording, the signal you record and reproduce is, instead, a series of digital pulses. These pulses are
called binary ones and zeros. These ones and zeros can represent one of three types of data: (1) data used
by digital computers, (2) pulsed square-wave signals, or (3) digitized analog waveforms.
