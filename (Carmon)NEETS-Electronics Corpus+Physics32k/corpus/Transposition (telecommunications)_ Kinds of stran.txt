In practice the following kinds of stranding occur more frequently:
Pair stranding: Two single wires are stranded to twisted pair transmission line.
Three-stranding: Three single wires are stranded to a tripartite group.
Four-stranding: Two tightly twisted pairs may be loosely twisted together, or:
Star quad twisting: Four single wires maintain the same relation to each other in the quad, whereby the members of a twisted pair face each other diagonally.
