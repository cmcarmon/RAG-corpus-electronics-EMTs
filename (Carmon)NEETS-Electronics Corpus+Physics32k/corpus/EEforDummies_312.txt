tance I measured was 255.4 kΩ.
For  the  parallel  resistors  (center  photo),  the 
calculated  equivalent  resistance  in  kΩ  was 
, and the actual

resistance I measured was 28.5 kΩ.
For  the  series‐parallel  combination  (right 
photo), the calculated resistance in kΩ was 
. , and the actual resistance I

measured was 29.4 kΩ.
Remember, the values of most resistors vary 
somewhat from their nominal values; That’s why 
the actual measured resistance for each resis­
tor combination shown here is a bit different (in 
these cases, < 2%) from its calculated equivalent  
resistance.
