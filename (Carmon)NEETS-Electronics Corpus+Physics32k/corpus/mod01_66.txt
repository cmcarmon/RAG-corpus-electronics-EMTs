Any particle that is a chemical combination of two or more atoms is called a molecule. The oxygen
molecule consists of two atoms of oxygen, and the hydrogen molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen.
Sugar, on the other hand, is a compound composed of atoms of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These
atoms are combined into sugar molecules. Since the sugar molecules can be broken down by chemical
means into smaller and simpler units, we cannot have sugar atoms.
