As depicted in Figure 8.22, we can compute the current gain by applying a
small test voltage at the input and measuring both the input current itest and
the output current io. The ratio io/itest is the current gain. Note that the output
current is not the current that flows through the dependent current source,
rather it is the current that is drawn by an external load resister RO. Because
it is dependent on the value of the load resistor, the current gain is defined
