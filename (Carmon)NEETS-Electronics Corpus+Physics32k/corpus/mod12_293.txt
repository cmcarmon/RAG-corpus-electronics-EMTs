Multivibrator Modulator.â€”Another type of frequency modulator is the astable multivibrator
illustrated in figure 2-13. Inserting the modulating af voltage in series with the base-return of the
multivibrator transistors causes the gate length, and thus the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator,
to vary. The amount of variation will be in accordance with the amplitude of the modulating voltage. One
requirement of this method is that the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator be high in relation to
the highest modulating frequencies. A factor of at least 100 provides the best results.
