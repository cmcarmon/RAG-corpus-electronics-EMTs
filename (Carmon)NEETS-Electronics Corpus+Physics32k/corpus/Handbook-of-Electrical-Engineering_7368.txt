Information theory has been used extensively to develop space telemetry for the most efﬁcient data trans-
mission  over  a  maximum  distance  with  a  minimum  of  transmitted  power.  Inefﬁciencies,  being  of  no  real
consequence in industrial telemetry, make for less elaborate, less costly equipment. Radio channels are used in
a relatively inefﬁcient manner, and the distances between transmitter and receiver are usually so short that there
are few problems of weak signals. In many cases, measurement and testing via telemetry links takes place in
completely shielded buildings or in metal housings.
