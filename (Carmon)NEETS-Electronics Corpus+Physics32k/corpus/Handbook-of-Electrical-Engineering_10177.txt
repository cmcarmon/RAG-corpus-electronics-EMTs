The EUAC and ROI methods consider the time value of money (continuous or discrete compounding) and
convert  all  investments,  cash  ﬂows,  salvage  values,  and  any  other  revenues  and  costs  into  their  equivalent
uniform  annual  cash  ﬂow  over  the  anticipated  life  of  the  project.  In  the  EUAC  method,  the  interest  rate  is
known and set at a minimal acceptable rate of return, whereas the ROI method has the objective to determine
the  interest  rate  earned  on  the  investment.  Details  to  such  techniques  are  presented  in  various  engineering
economy texts such as those by White et al. [1977] and Thuesen and Fabrycky [1989].
