In order to be selected, there must be a clear research question and a clear hypothesis that is related to the question. The hypothesis must be testable in 2.2 seconds, and gravity must be the experimental variable of the experiment. The utility of the proposed experiment in space exploration is an important criterion. The experimental apparatus may not be larger than a cube with sides that are 12 in (300 mm) long. For safety reasons, the following are not allowed:
Pressures more than 2 atm
Radioactive materials
Hazardous chemicals
Biological samples (with the exception of common household materials) or living organisms
All electrical circuits must have circuit diagrams and be approved by Glenn staff. Wires must meet national standards.
