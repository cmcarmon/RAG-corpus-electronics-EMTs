For small input signals it is often desirable to retain the large voltage gain of the basic CE
ampliﬁer even though an emitter resistor is used for DC stability. This can be done if a large
capacitor CE is used to bypass the AC signal around the emitter resistor. CE shorts out the
emitter bias resistor RE for AC signals. The magnitude of the resulting transfer function is
similar to a high-pass ﬁlter, with RE setting the gain (A = RC/RE) at low frequencies and
the capacitor maximizing the gain (A = hf eRC/hie) at high frequencies.
