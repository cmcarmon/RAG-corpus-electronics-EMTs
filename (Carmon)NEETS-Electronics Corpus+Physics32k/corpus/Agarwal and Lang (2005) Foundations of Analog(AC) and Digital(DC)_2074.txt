In the time domain, according to the interpretation of Q discussed in Section 12.2.1,
the high value of Q implies that the circuit will ring for many cycles if the input is set
to 0 and an initial voltage is present on the capacitor. Figure 14.41b shows the zero
input response for this circuit for vC(0) = 1 V. The time domain plot in Figure 14.41b
also shows that the circuit oscillates for approximately 25 cycles before it decays to an
unobservable level in the graph.
For R = 500 , Q = 2.5, a rather modest value. Thus, we do not expect to
see significant peakiness in the frequency response, as can be confirmed by observing
Figure 14.41c.
