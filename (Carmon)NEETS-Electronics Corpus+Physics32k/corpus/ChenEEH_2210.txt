two-dimensional space, cases corresponding to those of the
spherical distribution are obtained. Table 2.2 summarizes these
results along the right-hand column. Note that in the right-
hand column of Table 2.1, the variable rc is the radial variable
in cylindrical coordinates and, by the deﬁnition of a two-
dimensional ﬁeld, the solution is for an inﬁnitely long line
charge. In all these cases, the ﬁeld vanishes identically in those
regions where the Gaussian surfaces surround zero net charge,
and it becomes identical to the ﬁeld of a point (line) source
when the Gaussian surface surrounds a region with nonzero
net charge. When the ﬁeld inside a charge-ﬁlled region is being
calculated, the Gaussian surface penetrates the region, as sug-
gested in Figure 2.2. As long as ﬂux is perpendicular to the
surface, which is known from symmetry, Gauss’s law always
applies.
