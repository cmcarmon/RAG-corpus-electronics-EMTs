The tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The image to the right shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.
Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the f(t) and then integrate it to get q(t). More examples of equations can be seen below.
