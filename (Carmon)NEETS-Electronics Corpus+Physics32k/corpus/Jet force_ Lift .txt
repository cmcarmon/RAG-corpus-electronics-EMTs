Similar to our analysis of thrust, we begin with a mathematical look:
We define angle θ the same way we did in step 1 for thrust. Again, this angle θ is different at any given time.
For lift, however, we are looking for the vertical component, rather than the forward component. The sine of angle θ will give us the component of the force acting in vertical component. Multiplying the jet force by the sine of θ will yield the lift:

{\displaystyle Lift=JetForce*\sin \theta }

Similar to cosine, the sine of an angle ranging from 0° to 90° will always between at least zero and at most one. As such, the lift will also be less than the jet force. Of jet force, lift, and thrust, we can find any one of these if the other two are given using the distance formula. In this case, that would be:

{\displaystyle \surd (JetForce)^{2}=\surd (Thrust^{2}+Lift^{2})}

As such, jet force, thrust, and lift are inherently linked.
