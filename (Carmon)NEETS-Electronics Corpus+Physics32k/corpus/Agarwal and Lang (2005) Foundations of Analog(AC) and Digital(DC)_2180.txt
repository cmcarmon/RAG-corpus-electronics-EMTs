To get the Op Amp out of saturation, vi must be made positive enough to
) approximately to zero, hence vi must be approximately+6 volts.

If vi is slightly more positive than +6, vO will be driven negative, whereupon v
+
will be driven negative, driving v0 even more negative. Hence, vO undergoes a
regenerative negative transition to −12 V. Now vi must be made more negative
than −6 volts to initiate a regenerative transition to +12 V. the width of the
hysteresis region can be controlled by the ratio of the feedback resistors.
