A word of caution hereâ€”be careful that the results are graphed in an appropriate manner. Most spreadsheet
packages have very limited x-axis (horizontal) manipulation. Provided the x-axis data comes in regular steps,
the results are acceptable. However, we have seen instances where very distorted graphs have been presented
because of this problem.
