The variable z(t) is the mathematical expectation of x(t). The
variable r(t) corresponds to the costate variable of optimal
control theory because it is the variable that enforces the
differential equation constraint between z(t) and n(t). The
variable n(t) and y(t) are introduced to reduce the integro-
differential equation.
