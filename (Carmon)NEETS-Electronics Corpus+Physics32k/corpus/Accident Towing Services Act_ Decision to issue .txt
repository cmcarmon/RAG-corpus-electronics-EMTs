The Act positions VicRoads as the prime agency able to issue both regular and heavy accident towing licences. However, authorisation to issue licences must be obtained first from the Minister who is conferred with power by the Act to authorise the issuing of regular tow truck licences for particular areas of the State. The Minister can only make such an authorisation if she or she considers it to be in the public interest having regard to any increase in the need for tow trucks in the relevant area. Alternatively, the authorisation can be made if the licences are to replace existing licences or exceptional circumstances justify the issue of new licences. Similar tests apply to the Minister's decision about the numbers of heavy tow truck licences which are to be made available.
Special rules apply to the issue of regular and heavy tow truck licences used for the provision of accident towing services on the CityLink and EastLink toll roads. Ministerial authorisations for the issue of licences must be published in the Government Gazette and must specify the number of licences to be issued.
