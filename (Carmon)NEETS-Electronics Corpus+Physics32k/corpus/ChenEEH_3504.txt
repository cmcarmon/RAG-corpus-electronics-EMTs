processing. DVD video is usually encoded from digital studio
master tapes to MPEG-2 format, where MPEG refers to
Moving Pictures Expert Group. The encoding process uses
lossy compression that removes information that is either
redundant or not readily perceptible by the human eye. The
ultimate objective in compression is to reduce the bit rate for
storage and transmission of video. The signal processing used
here consists of applying suitable transforms to the data. Typ-
ically, a reduction in bit-rate requirements by a factor of 30 to
40 permits acceptable video quality.
