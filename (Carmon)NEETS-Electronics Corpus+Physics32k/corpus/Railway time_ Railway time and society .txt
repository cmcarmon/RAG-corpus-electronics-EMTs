The introduction of railway time was not without controversy expressed in other ways by the artists of the day and more recently.
William Wordsworth in his protest against the building of the Kendal and Windermere Railway in 1844 wrote "Is then no nook of English ground secure from rash assault?" He was concerned about the loss of timeless isolation and individuality through the impact on his quiet rural idyll of the hordes from the industrial towns.
Charles Dickens expressed concerns several times, such as in Dombey and Son where he wrote "There was even railway time observed in clocks, as if the sun itself had given in".
Thomas Hardy in A Pair of Blue Eyes makes specific reference to railway time and its effect on seemingly contracting human time.
Alan Plater, an English playwright, wrote the play Only A Matter Of Time, in 2002. A Welsh farmer and an envoy for Brunel meet. A discourse takes place on the imminent arrival of the railway connecting the farmer's village to London, why this will require the standardisation of time, and how this will affect the villagers' lives.
