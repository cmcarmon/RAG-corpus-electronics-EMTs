In the transit chain the signals are modulated, combined, and frequency-shifted with an upconverter to the
desired satellite transmit frequency. After upconversion, the signals are ampliﬁed by HPAs. In a large earth station,
there may be many HPAs which feed to a single antenna. These signals must be switched and combined appro-
priately. At microwave frequencies, waveguide combiners are used to route the output of the HPAs to the antenna.
In the receive chain, the counterpart to the HPA is the low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA), which is used to amplify
the signals received from the antenna. This ampliﬁer must be designed for maximum gain with a very small
noise contribution. The noise generated in this unit contributes signiﬁcantly to the overall performance of the
receive side of the earth station. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) FETs are commonly used in the ampliﬁer section of
the LNA because of their low-noise characteristics. The LNA feeds the signal to the frequency downconverter,
which converts it to IF frequency suitable for demodulator.
