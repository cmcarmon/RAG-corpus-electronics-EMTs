Waves at frequencies above the muf are normally refracted so slowly that they return to Earth 
beyond the desired location, or pass on through the ionosphere and are lost. You should understand, 
however, that use of an established muf certainly does not guarantee successful communications between 
a transmitting site and a receiving site. Variations in the ionosphere may occur at any time and 
consequently raise or lower the predetermined muf. This is particularly true for radio waves being 
refracted by the highly variable F2 layer.
