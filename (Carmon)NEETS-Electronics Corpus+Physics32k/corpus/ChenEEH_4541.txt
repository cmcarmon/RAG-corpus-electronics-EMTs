The reader will recognize these equations as the familiar ‘‘state
model’’ of linear dynamical system theory. Thus, intuitively, the
component connection model may be viewed as a generaliza-
tion of the linear state model. In fact, the L matrices describe
how to interconnect subsystems to form a large-scale system S,
just as integrators used to be patched together on an analog
computer to simulate a system. If one views the L matrices as a
generalization of the state model, where the integrators have
been replaced by general components, a beneﬁcial cross fertil-
ization between component connection theory and classical
system theory results. It is possible and indeed useful to talk
about controllable or observable connections (Singh, 1972).
