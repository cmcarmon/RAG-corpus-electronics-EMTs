The PMCVD Process.  The PMCVD is an enhancement of the MCVD process. Very high rates of deposition
(up  to  10  g/min,  compared  to  2  g/min  for  MCVD)  are  achieved  by  using  larger  diameter  tubes  and  an  RF
plasma for reaction (Fig. 42.22). Because of the very high temperature of the plasma, water cooling is essential.
An oxyhydrogen torch follows the plasma and sinters the deposition. The high rates of deposition are achieved
because of very high thermal gradients from the center of the tube to the wall and the resulting high thermo-
phoretic driving force. The PMCVD process is still in the development stage and has not been commercialized.
