In cases of mixed convection (natural and forced occurring together) one would often like to know how much of the convection is due to external constraints, such as the fluid velocity in the pump, and how much is due to natural convection occurring in the system.
The relative magnitudes of the Grashof and Reynolds numbers squared determine which form of convection dominates. If

{\displaystyle Gr/Re^{2}\gg 1}
, forced convection may be neglected, whereas if

{\displaystyle Gr/Re^{2}\ll 1}
, natural convection may be neglected. If the ratio is approximately one, then both forced and natural convection need to be taken into account.
