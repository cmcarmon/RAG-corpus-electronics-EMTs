In order for a shell balance to work, the flow must:
Be laminar flow
Be without bends or curves in the flow
Steady State
Have two boundary conditions
Boundary Conditions are used to find constants of integration.
Fluid - Solid Boundary: No-slip condition, the velocity of a liquid at a solid is equal to the velocity of the solid
Liquid - Gas Boundary: Shear Stress = 0
Liquid - Liquid Boundary: Equal velocity and shear stress on both liquids
