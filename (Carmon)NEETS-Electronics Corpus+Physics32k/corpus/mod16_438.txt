The multimeter has two selector switches. The switch on the lower left is the function switch, and the
one in the lower center is the range switch. The function switch selects the type of current you will be
measuring (+dc, - dc, or ac). The range switch is a 12-position switch that selects the range of ohmmeter,
voltmeter, or milliammeter measurements you will make.
