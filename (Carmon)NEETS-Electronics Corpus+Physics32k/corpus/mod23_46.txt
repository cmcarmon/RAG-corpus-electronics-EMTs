In 1907, Mr. Poulsen discovered a solution to this problem. He discovered dc bias. He found that if a
fixed dc voltage were added to the input signal, it moved the input signal away from the step in the
magnetism curve. This prevented the input signal from crossing the zero-point of the magnetism curve.
The result is an output signal exactly like the input signal. Figure 1-2 shows this process.
