Now that we’ve covered Thevenin and Norton source equivalencies, we have the tools neces-
sary to understand Millman’s equation. What Millman’s equation is actually doing is treating
each branch (with its series voltage source and resistance) as a Thevenin equivalent circuit
and then converting each one into equivalent Norton circuits.
