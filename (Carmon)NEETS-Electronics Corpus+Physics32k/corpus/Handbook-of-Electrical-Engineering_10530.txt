developed  for  aviation  generally  transition  to  cars  and  trains  as  they  are  service-proven  and  as  their  cost
decreases. A driver or train operator once had a few lights, a gauge or two, a throttle of some sort, and a brake
handle or pedal. For vehicles that are not automated but are partially automated or allow manual operation at
times, a human operator today is confronted by a dense array of dials, buttons, data and CCTV screens, LCD
panels,  microphones,  and  annunciators  (audio  and  visual)  of  various  types.  In  some  cases  there  is  far  more
information than an operator can use. In others, there is duplication between the old, analog indicators and
controls and new, digital or “soft” controls on a touch screen.
