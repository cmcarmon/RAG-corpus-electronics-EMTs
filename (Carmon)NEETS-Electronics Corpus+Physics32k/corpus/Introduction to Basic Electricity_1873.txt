A voltmeter is used to measure the voltage (dif-
ference of potential) between two points in a circuit. A 
voltmeter can be considered a pressure gauge, used to 
measure the electrical pressure in a circuit (Figure 15-6).
Resistance is measured with an ohmmeter. To 
measure resistance, a voltage is placed across the  device 
to be measured, inducing a current flow through the
