data locality (box curve). Next, two different optimization paths
are followed: an energy-optimized one and a performance-
optimized one. The main difference is the modiÔ¨Åed use of the
available memory hierarchy: using the technique of Diguet et al.
(1997), another intermediate signal is created and assigned
differently for the speed-optimized implementation. As a con-
sequence, an energy-intensive multiport memory is added in
the memory hierarchy, delivering more bandwidth and improv-
ing the worst-case execution path of the application.
