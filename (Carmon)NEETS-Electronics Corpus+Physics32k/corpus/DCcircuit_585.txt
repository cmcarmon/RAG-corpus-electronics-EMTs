• Step 7: Repeat steps 5 and 6 until all values for voltage and current are known in the
original circuit conﬁguration. Essentially, you will proceed step-by-step from the sim-
pliﬁed version of the circuit back into its original, complex form, plugging in values of
voltage and current where appropriate until all values of voltage and current are known.
