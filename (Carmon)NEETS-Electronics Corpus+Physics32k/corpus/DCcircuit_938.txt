Generally speaking, network analysis is any structured technique used to mathematically an-
alyze a circuit (a “network” of interconnected components). Quite often the technician or engi-
neer will encounter circuits containing multiple sources of power or component conﬁgurations
which defy simpliﬁcation by series/parallel analysis techniques. In those cases, he or she will
be forced to use other means. This chapter presents a few techniques useful in analyzing such
complex circuits.
