Let us model the effects of small changes in the base current. If the
changes  are  small,  the  nonlinear  nature  of  the  conductance  can  be
ignored and the circuit model becomes a linear conductance (or resis-
tor). Mathematically this conductance arises from a ﬁrst-order expan-
sion of the nonlinear function. Thus, if vBE = VBE + vbe, where vBE is the
total base-emitter voltage, VBE is a (large) constant voltage and vbe is a
(small) variation in the base-emitter voltage, then the ﬁrst two terms in
a Taylor series expansion are
