Figure 5.14 shows several useful gate symbols. We have already seen the
gate-level representation of the AND function. The OR gate performs the
OR function of its inputs. The NOT gate takes the complement of its input.
For convenience, we often denote the NOT function in logic circuits using
the ‘‘◦’’ symbol. The buffer gate or identity gate simply copies the input value
to its output, that is, A = A. Its use will become apparent in Section 6.9.2.
The NAND function is equivalent to the AND operation followed by the NOT
operation. For example, A = B NAND C is equivalent to A = B AND C. It is
also equivalent to the statement: A is FALSE only if both B and C are TRUE.
Similarly, the NOR operation is equivalent to the OR operation followed by
the NOT operation.
