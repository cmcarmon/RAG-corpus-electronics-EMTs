The gunn oscillator can deliver continuous power up to about 65 milliwatts and pulsed outputs of up 
to about 200 watts peak. The power output of a solid chip is limited by the difficulty of removing heat 
from the small chip. Much higher power outputs have been achieved using wafers of gallium-arsenide as 
a single source.
