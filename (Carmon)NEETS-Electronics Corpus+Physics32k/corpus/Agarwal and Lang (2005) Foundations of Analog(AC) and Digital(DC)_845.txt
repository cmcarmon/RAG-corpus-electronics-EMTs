(cid:1) At their inputs, the inverters must recognize voltages greater than VIH = 3.5 V as
a logical 1. Since our inverters recognize voltages above 1 V as a logical 1, they
satisfy this condition as well.
Finally, at their inputs, the inverters must recognize voltages less than VIL = 1.5 V
as a logical 0 if they are to satisfy Discoâ€™s static discipline. Unfortunately, our
inverters can recognize voltages only below 1 V as a 0, and thus do not satisfy this
condition.
