In a RISC processor, a write into a register may be performed
every clock cycle. Incremental checkpointing is performed for
the register ﬁle by using a delayed-write buffer (DWB) to store
the written register values for up to N clock cycles to realize a
rollback range of N. Figure 8.16 shows the DWB structure for
supporting microrollback in the register ﬁle.
