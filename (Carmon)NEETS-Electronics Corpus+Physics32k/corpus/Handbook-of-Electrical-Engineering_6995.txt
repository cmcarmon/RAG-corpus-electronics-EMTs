8. Continuous sampling. When a signal is known on one or more disjoint intervals, it is said to have been
continuously sampled. Divide the time line into intervals of T. Periodic continuous sampling assumes
that the signal is known on each interval over an interval of aT where a is the duty cycle. Continuously
sampled  signals  can  be  accurately  interpolated  even  in  the  presence  of  aliasing.  Other  continuously
sampled cases, each of which can be considered as a limiting case of continuously periodically sampled
restoration, include
(a) Interpolation. The tails of a signal are known and we wish to restore the middle.
(b) Extrapolation. We wish to generate the tails of a function with knowledge of the middle.
(c) Prediction. A signal for  t > 0 is to be estimated from knowledge of the signal for  t < 0.
