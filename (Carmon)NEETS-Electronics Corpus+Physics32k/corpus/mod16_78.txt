timely manner. The "no reject" policy says, in effect, that test equipment submitted to the IMA for
calibration, which is later found to require repair, will be repaired by the repair department of the IMA.
Before this policy, any equipment found inoperative by the calibration lab was marked REJECTED, the
reasons stated, and the equipment returned uncalibrated to the ship for repairs. The "no reject" policy does
not relieve you of your responsibility to ensure your equipment is in working order prior to submitting it
for calibration. Its purpose is to streamline the procedure and cut down delays in returning your
equipment to you calibrated and ready to use.
