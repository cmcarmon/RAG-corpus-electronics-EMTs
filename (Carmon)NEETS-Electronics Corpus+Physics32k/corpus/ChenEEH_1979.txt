A simple method is basic path signature analysis (BPSA), in
which the nodes of the CFG are a branch-free sequence of
assembly level instructions, and the reference information is
given by embedded signatures inserted at the beginning of each
block (Mahmood and McCluskey, 1988); see Figure 8.12. The
WD monitors the memory data bus of the processor and
captures the reference signatures using tag bits to differentiate
them from the normal instructions. At the end of each block,
this signature is compared to the concurrently computed one
(from the read instruction sequence).
