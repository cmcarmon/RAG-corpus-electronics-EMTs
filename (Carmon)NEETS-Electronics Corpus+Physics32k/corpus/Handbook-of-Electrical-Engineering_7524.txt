A block diagram and schematic for a CMOS inverter circuit is shown in Fig. 79.2. Note that it is a simpler
and much more compact circuit design than that for the TTL inverter. That fact is a major reason why MOSFET
integrated circuits have a much higher circuit density than BJT integrated circuits and is one advantage that
MOSFET ICs have over BJT ICs. As a result, CMOS is used in all levels of integration, from SSI through VLSI
(very large scale integration).
