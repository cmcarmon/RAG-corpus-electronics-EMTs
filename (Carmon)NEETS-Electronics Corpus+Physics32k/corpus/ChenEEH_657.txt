Apart from the storage architecture itself, the way data are
mapped to these architecture components is important for a
good overall memory management solution. Actually, these
issues are gaining in importance in the current age of deep
submicron technologies, where technology and circuit solu-
tions are not sufﬁcient on their own to solve the system design
bottlenecks. In current practice, designers usually go for the
highest speed implementation for most submodules of a com-
plex system, even when real-time constraints apply for the
global design. Moreover, the design tools for exploration sup-
port (e.g., compilers and system synthesis tools) focus mainly
on the performance aspect. The system cost, however can often
be signiﬁcantly reduced by system-level code transformations
