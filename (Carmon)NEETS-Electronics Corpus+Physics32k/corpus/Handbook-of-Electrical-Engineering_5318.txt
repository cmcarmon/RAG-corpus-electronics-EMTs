In  a  thermoelectric  generator,  the  Seebeck  voltage  generated  under  a  temperature  difference  drives  a  dc
current through the load circuit. Even though there is no mechanical conversion, the process is still Carnot-
limited since it operates over a temperature difference. In practice, several couples are assembled in a series-
parallel conÔ¨Åguration to provide dc output power at the required voltage.
