An FM radio superheterodyne receiver is shown in block diagram form in Figure 15.2.23.
The part consisting of the antenna, RF ampliﬁer, mixer, and local oscillator functions in a manner
similar to that of an AM receiver, except that the frequencies involved are different. fIF = 10.7
MHz in FM, so that the image is 21.4 MHz from the carrier frequency fc. The RF ampliﬁer must
eliminate the image-frequency band 2f IF away from the station to which the receiver is tuned.
