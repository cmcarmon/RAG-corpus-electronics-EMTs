M-of-N systems are a generalization of the ideal parallel system. In the ideal parallel system, only one of N
modules is required to work for the system to work. In the M-of-N system, however, M of the total of N identical
modules are required to function for the system to function. A good example is the TMR conÔ¨Åguration where
two of the three modules must work for the majority voting mechanism to function properly. Therefore, the
TMR system is a 2-of-3 system.
