Contamination-related failures of traditional porcelain and
glass insulators usually manifest as ﬂashovers, a self-restoring
failure mode. This is true provided the quality of insulators is
good, which means that there will be no internal failure. Flash-
overs mostly result in short-term interruptions in power deliv-
ery. For nonceramic/composite insulators, failure could be
in the form of a ﬂashover and/or degradation of the insulator,
in which case the insulator has to be replaced, leading to a
prolonged outage.
