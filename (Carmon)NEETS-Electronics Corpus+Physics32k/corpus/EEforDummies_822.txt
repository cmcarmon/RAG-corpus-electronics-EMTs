discuss in Chapter 10) that are encased in a clear package so that light 
biases the base‐emitter junction. These devices usually contain only two 
leads (whereas standard transistors contain three leads). That’s because 
you don’t need access to the base of the transistor to bias it — light 
does that job for you. From the outside, phototransistors look just like 
photodiodes, so you really have to keep track of which is which.
