The forward dc (‘‘Gummel’’) characteristics and the current
gain were already shown in Figure 5.7. For most processes, the
voltage drop DVIB is caused by only rE and rB, whereas DVIC
contains in addition the inﬂuence of high-current effects,
causing B to drop at higher JC. Therefore, IC(VBE) should not
be used for determining the series resistances!
