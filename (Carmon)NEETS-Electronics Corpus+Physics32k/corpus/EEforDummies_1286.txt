In Chapter 11, you get a peek at a microcontroller, which is a tiny computer on 
a chip. You create a program on your computer, and download the program 
onto the chip. Then when you power up the chip, it follows the instructions 
in your program. The BASIC Stamp and PICAXE microcontrollers are inex­
pensive alternatives that use the easy‐to‐learn BASIC programming language. 
However, the beginner‐friendly Arduino microcontroller system, which uses 
a C‐like programming language, has exploded in popularity in recent years 
due to its simplified integrated development environment (IDE), versatility, 
affordability, and enormous online user community.
