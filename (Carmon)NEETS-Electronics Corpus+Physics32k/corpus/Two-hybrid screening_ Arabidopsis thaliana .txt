In 2005 a two hybrid system in plants was developed. Using protoplasts of A. thaliana protein-protein interactions can be studied in plants. This way the interactions can be studied in their native context. In this system the GAL4 AD and BD are under the control of the strong 35S promoter. Interaction is measured using a GUS reporter. In order to enable a high-throughput screening the vectors were made gateway compatible. The system is known as the protoplast two hybrid (P2H) system.
