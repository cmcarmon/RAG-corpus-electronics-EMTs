Some multimeters use a 20,000 ohms-per-volt meter sensitivity for measuring dc voltage and a 5,000
ohms-per-volt sensitivity for measuring ac voltage. The higher the meter resistance, the less it will load
the circuit. The idea is to keep circuit loading to an absolute minimum so that the circuit under test is
unaffected by the meter. In this way, you can get a clearer picture of what the circuit malfunction is, not
the effect of the meter on the circuit.
