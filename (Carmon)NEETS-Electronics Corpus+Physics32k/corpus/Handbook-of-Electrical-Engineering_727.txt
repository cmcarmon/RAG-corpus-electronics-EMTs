where v1(t) results from other poles of Vo(s). If p is a real positive number or a complex number with a positive
real part, vo(t) is unbounded because  e pt is a growing exponential. Therefore, for absolute stability there can
be no pole of Vo(s) that is positive or has a positive real part. This is equivalent to saying that Vo(s) has no poles
in  the  right  half  of  the s-plane.  Since  vi (t)  is  bounded, Vi (s)  has  no  poles  in  the  right  half-plane.  Therefore,
since the only poles of Vo(s) are those of H(s) and Vi (s), no pole of H(s) for an absolutely stable circuit can be
in the right-half of the s-plane.
