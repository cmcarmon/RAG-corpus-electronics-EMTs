At the instant the switch is thrown to position 2 (fig. 3-6(B)), a displacement of electrons occurs
simultaneously in all parts of the circuit. This electron displacement is directed away from the negative
terminal and toward the positive terminal of the source (the battery). A brief surge of current will flow as
the capacitor charges.
