An indication of the expanding level of interest in FDTD
Maxwell’s equations solvers is the hundreds of papers currently
published in this area worldwide each year, as opposed to
fewer than ten as recently as 1985 and prior to that year
(Shlager and Schneider, 1998). This expansion continues as
engineers and scientists in nontraditional electromagnetics-
related areas such as digital systems and integrated optics
become aware of the power of such direct solution techniques
for Maxwell’s equations.
