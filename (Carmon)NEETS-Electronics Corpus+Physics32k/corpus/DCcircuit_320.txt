It would be good to mention at this point that overcurrent devices are not intended to
provide protection against electric shock. Rather, they exist solely to protect conductors from
overheating due to excessive currents. The temporary shorting wires just described would
indeed cause any overcurrent devices in the circuit to ”trip” if the disconnect switch were to be
closed, but realize that electric shock protection is not the intended function of those devices.
Their primary function would merely be leveraged for the purpose of worker protection with
the shorting wire in place.
