Computer algorithms are developed by using the before-fault, during-fault, and after-fault ZBUS matrix of
the reactive network reduced to generator internal voltages with generators represented by their subtransient
reactances. Each generator’s swing curve is obtained by numerical integration of its power angle for a speciﬁed
condition,  then  a  set  of  swing  curves  is  tabulated  or  graphed  for  observation  of  the  transient  stability.  An
example with partial calculated data and a line plot for such a study are included on the next page.
