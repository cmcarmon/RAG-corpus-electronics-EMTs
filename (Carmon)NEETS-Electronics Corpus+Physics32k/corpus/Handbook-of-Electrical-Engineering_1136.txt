Computer programs are available that accept speciﬁcations on a digital ﬁlter and carry out all steps required
to design the ﬁlter, including prewarping frequencies, designing the analog ﬁlter, and performing the bilinear
transform. Two such programs are given in the references [Parks and Burrus, 1987; Antoniou, 1979].
