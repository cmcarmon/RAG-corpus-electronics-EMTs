So far, we have examined discrete-time and continuous-time
signals as well as LSI systems in the time domain. We now
consider signal and LSI system descriptions in the frequency
domain motivated by the fact that analysis and design may be
more conveniently done in the frequency domain. Central to
frequency-domain description and analysis is the fact that
signals (and impulse responses) can be conveniently repre-
sented in terms of sinusoids and complex exponentials that
are eigenfunctions of LSI systems.
