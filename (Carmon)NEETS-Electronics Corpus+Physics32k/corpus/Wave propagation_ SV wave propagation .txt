The analytical solution of SV-wave in a half-space indicates that the plane SV wave reflects back to the domain as a P and SV waves, leaving out special cases. The angle of reflected SV wave is identical to the incidence wave, while the angle of reflected P wave is greater than the SV wave. Note also that for the same wave frequency, the SV wavelength is smaller than the P wavelength. This fact has been depicted in this animated picture.
