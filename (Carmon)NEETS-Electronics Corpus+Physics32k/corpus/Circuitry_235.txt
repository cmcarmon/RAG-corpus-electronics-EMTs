amount greater than its forward threshold voltage 
(about 0.6 V if the material is silicon and 0.2 V if 
the  material  is  germanium),  the  diode  will  freely 
pass  current.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  P-type 
material  is  made  negative  relative  to  the  N-type 
material,  virtually  no  current  will  flow  unless  the 
applied voltage exceeds the maximum (breakdown) 
voltage  that  the  device  can  withstand.  Note  that  a 
normal  diode  will  be  destroyed  if  its  reverse 
breakdown voltage is exceeded. 
  A semiconductor junction diode is shown in Fig. 
5.4.  The  connection  to  the  P-type  material  is 
referred  to  as  the  anode  while  that  to  the  N-type 
material is called the cathode. With no externally 
applied  potential,  electrons  from 
the  N-type 
material  will  cross  into  the  P-type  region  and  fill 
some of the vacant holes. This action will result in 
the  production  of  a  region  either  side  of  the 
junction in which there are no free charge carriers. 
This zone is known as the depletion region.
