The  encoded  data  signal  forms  the  input  to  the  modulator.  To  further  conserve  bandwidth,  a  type  of
quadrature modulation is employed. The actual form is 8-VSB, a variation of digital vestigial sideband that
includes trellis coding. This possesses many of the advantages of guadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).
The corresponding receiver is shown in Fig. 69.23. The receiver simply forms the inverse of each transmitter
operation. The received signal is Ô¨Årst demodulated. The resulting data signal is decoded to remove the redun-
dancy  and  correct  errors. A  demultiplexer  separates  the  signal  into  the  original  four  (or  more)  data  signals.
The audio and synchronization signals need no further processing.
