There is a wealth of textbooks on data structures. Papers on special aspects of data types and their relation to
programming languages are found regularly in periodicals such as ACM Transactions on Programming Languages
and  Systems,  the  Journal  of  the  Association  for  Computing  Machinery,  IEEE  Transactions  on  Computers,  IEEE
Transactions on Software Engineering, or Acta Informatica.
