SERIES-POSITIVE LIMITER WITH BIAS.â€”In the series-positive limiter (figure 4-1, view 
(A)), the reference point at the bottom of resistor R1 is ground, or 0 volts. By placing a dc potential at 
point (1) in figure 4-3 (views (A) and (B)), you can change the reference point. The reference point 
changes by the amount of dc potential that is supplied by the battery. The battery can either aid or oppose 
the flow of current in the series-limiter circuit. POSITIVE BIAS (aiding) is shown in view (A) and 
NEGATIVE BIAS (opposing) is shown in view (B).
