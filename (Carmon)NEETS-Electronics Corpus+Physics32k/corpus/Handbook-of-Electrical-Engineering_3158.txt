Buck Converter
A  buck  converter  is  also  called  a step-down  converter.  Its  principle  of  operation  is  illustrated  by  referring  to
Fig.  30.17(a).  The  IGBT  acts  as  a  high-frequency  switch.  The  IGBT  is  repetitively  closed  for  a  time  ton  and
opened for a time toff. During ton, the supply terminals are connected to the load, and power ﬂows from supply
to the load. During toff, load current ﬂows through the freewheeling diode D1, and the load voltage is ideally
zero. The average output voltage is given by
