Conventional caches traditionally could not accept requests while they were servicing a miss request. In other
words,  they 
  when  servicing  a  miss.  The  growing  penalty  for  cache  misses  has  made  it
necessary  for  high-end  commodity  memory  systems  to  continue  to  accept  (and  service)  requests  from  the
processor while a miss is being serviced. Some systems are able to service multiple miss requests simultaneously.

To  allow  this  mode  of  operation,  the  cache  design  is 
caches have one structure for each simultaneous outstanding miss that they can service. This structure holds
the information necessary to correctly return the loaded data to the processor, even if the misses come back in
a different order than that in which they were sent.
