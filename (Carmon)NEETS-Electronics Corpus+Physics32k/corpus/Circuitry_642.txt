shown  in  Fig.  13.28.  Now  select  modulated  RF 
output  on 
to 
modulation  depth 
the 
oscilloscope  timebase  setting  to  1  ms/cm  and 
display the output waveforms produced. Sketch two 
or  three  cycles  of  the  waveforms  using  the  layout 
shown in Fig. 13.29. 
  Switch  the  modulation  off  and  check  that  the 
output of the signal generator is still set to 455 kHz. 
Accurately  measure 
the  peak-peak  RF  output 
(Channel 1). This should be approximately 500 mV 
pk-pk. Record the output voltage in a table similar 
to that shown in Table 13.3.  
  Vary the signal generator output frequency over 
the range 200 kHz to 700 kHz in suitable steps and 
record the peak-peak output voltage at each step in 
your table.  
 
Calculations and graphs 
 
Record  your  results  in  Table  13.3.  Plot  a  graph 
showing  the  frequency  response  of  the  RF/IF 
amplifier  using  the  graph  layout  shown  in  Fig. 
13.27. Determine the frequency at which maximum 
voltage  gain  is  achieved  and  calculate  the  stage 
gain  at 
the 
bandwidth of the amplifier stage. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Comment  on  the  shape  of  the  frequency  response 
and  the  waveform  sketches.  Were  these  what  you 
would expect? Suggest a typical application for the 
circuit.
