Figure 2.17 shows the trade-off for the complete cycle budget
range. The trade-off is obtained by letting the tool explore the
cycle budget starting from the fully sequential mode and then
progressing through the most interesting memory organiza-
tions (from a cost point of view) to reduce the cycle budget.
Differently optimized code speciÔ¨Åcations are displayed and are
derived by applying several system-level DTSE transformations
prior to the individual Pareto curve generation. More infor-
mation about these different versions of the code can be found
in Brockmeyer (2000) and Vandecappelle (1999).
