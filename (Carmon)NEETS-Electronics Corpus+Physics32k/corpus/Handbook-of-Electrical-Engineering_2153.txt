Size of Training Set
The size of the training set is very important for good performance. Remember that the ANN gets its information
from the training set. If the training data do not cover the full range of operating conditions, the system may
perform  badly  when  deployed.  Under  no  circumstances  should  the  training  set  be  less  than  the  number  of
weights in the ANN. A good size of the training data is ten times the number of weights in the network, with
the lower limit being set around three times the number of weights (these values should be taken as an indication,
subject to experimentation for each case) [Haykin, 1994].
