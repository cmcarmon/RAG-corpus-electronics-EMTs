*15.1.40 An antenna with an effective noise temperature of
130 K couples through a waveguide that has a loss
of 0.8 dB to a receiver. Find the effective noise
temperature presented by the waveguide output to
the receiver if the waveguideâ€™s physical tempera-
ture is 280 K.
15.1.41 If the antenna and waveguide of Problem 15.1.40
feed a receiver for which BN = 10 MHz, Ga(f 0) =
