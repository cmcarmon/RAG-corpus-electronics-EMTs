Parts  placement  may  be  done  manually  for  prototype  or  low-volume  operations,  although  this  author
suggests  the  use  of  guided  Xâ€“Y  tables  with  vacuum  part  pickup  for  even  the  smallest  operation.  Manual
placement of SMDs does not lend itself to repeatable work. For medium and high volume work, a multitude
of machines are available. See Fig. 26.11 for the four general categories of automated placement equipment.
