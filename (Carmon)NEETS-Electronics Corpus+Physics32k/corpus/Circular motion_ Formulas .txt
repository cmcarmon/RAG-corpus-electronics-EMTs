For motion in a circle of radius r, the circumference of the circle is C = 2π r. If the period for one rotation is T, the angular rate of rotation, also known as angular velocity, ω is:

The vector relationships are shown in Figure 1. The axis of rotation is shown as a vector ω perpendicular to the plane of the orbit and with a magnitude ω = dθ / dt. The direction of ω is chosen using the right-hand rule. With this convention for depicting rotation, the velocity is given by a vector cross product as





v

=

ω

r


,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} \ ,}

which is a vector perpendicular to both ω and r(t), tangential to the orbit, and of magnitude ω r. Likewise, the acceleration is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \left({\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} \right)\ ,}

which is a vector perpendicular to both ω and v(t) of magnitude ω |v| = ω2 r and directed exactly opposite to r(t).
In the simplest case the speed, mass and radius are constant.
Consider a body of one kilogram, moving in a circle of radius one metre, with an angular velocity of one radian per second.
The speed is one metre per second.
The inward acceleration is one metre per square second, v2/r.
It is subject to a centripetal force of one kilogram metre per square second, which is one newton.
The momentum of the body is one kg·m·s−1.
The moment of inertia is one kg·m2.
The angular momentum is one kg·m2·s−1.
The kinetic energy is 1/2 joule.
The circumference of the orbit is 2π (~6.283) metres.
The period of the motion is 2π seconds per turn.
The frequency is (2π)−1 hertz.
