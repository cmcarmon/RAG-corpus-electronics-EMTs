As with most amplifiers, the gain of an operational amplifier varies with frequency. The
specification sheets for operational amplifiers will usually state the open-loop (no feedback) gain for d.c.
(or 0 hertz). At higher frequencies, the gain is much lower. In fact, for an operational amplifier, the gain
decreases quite rapidly as frequency increases.
