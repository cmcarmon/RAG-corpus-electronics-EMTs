flipped in orientation.
LEDs are polarized, so it matters which way you orient them. Current 
flows from the positive side to the negative side but not vice versa (refer 
to ChapterÂ 9 for details). The negative side of an LED has a shorter lead.
Insert the positive side of LED1 in the same row as the negative side of 
the capacitor. Connect the negative side of LED1 to the negative power 
rail. Insert the negative side of LED2 into the same row as the negative 
cap lead and the positive side of LED2 into the negative power rail.
