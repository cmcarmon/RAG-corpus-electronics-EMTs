Although subdomain bases are probably more ﬂexible in terms of their applicability, they have a disadvantage
generally  not  exhibited  by  the  entire-domain  form,  which  is  the  discontinuity  that  occurs  at  the  domain
boundaries. This discontinuity arises because an ns-term subdomain function can provide at most ns – 1 degrees
of continuity to an adjacent basis of the unknown it represents, assuming one of the ns constants is reserved
for the unknown itself. For example, the three-term or sinusoidal subdomain basis ai + bi sin(ks) + ci cos(ks)
used  for  wire  modeling  can  represent  a  current  continuous  at  most  up  to  its  ﬁrst  derivative.  This  provides
continuous charge density but produces a discontinuous ﬁrst derivative in charge equivalent to a tripole charge
at each junction.
