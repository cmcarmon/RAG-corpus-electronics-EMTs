High-G training is done by aviators and astronauts who are subject to high levels of acceleration ('G'). It is designed to prevent a g-induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC), a situation when the action of g-forces move the blood away from the brain to the extent that consciousness is lost. Incidents of acceleration-induced loss of consciousness have caused fatal accidents in aircraft capable of sustaining high-g for considerable periods.
The value of training has been well established during the decades since the 1970s and has been the subject of much research and literature, and training has contributed to extending pilots' G tolerance in both magnitude and duration. This training has allowed pilots and crews to more safely exploit the capabilities of high performance aircraft. This training will become more important as new weapons systems are fielded with even higher performance capabilities.
Training includes centrifuge, Anti-G Straining Maneuvers (AGSM), and acceleration physiology.
