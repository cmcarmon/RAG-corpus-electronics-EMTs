The signal controlling the input to the register is applied to all ﬂip-ﬂops simultaneously and its action depends
on the type of ﬂip-ﬂop used. Edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops set or reset according to the value on the data inputs at
the time the control signal changes. These registers are sometimes known as staticizers. After the few nanosec-
onds required for the ﬂip-ﬂops to settle to their new values, the register content is available at the output gating.
The correct operation of the circuitry depends upon certain timing criteria being satisﬁed and minimum values
are quoted by the manufacturers. Each is the smallest time above which the device is guaranteed to operate
correctly, but in practice the device probably functions satisfactorily with smaller time intervals on at least some
of  the  parameters.  The  main  timing  constraints  occur  at  the  inputs  to  the  ﬂip-ﬂops  and  are  illustrated  in
Fig. 81.28. The interval preceding the active transition of the control input is the setup time, tsu, during which
the data signal must be held steady; th is the hold time and is the interval during which the data signal must
be retained following the active transition of the control input; tw is a minimum pulse width indication which
applies to the control inputs such as the clock, reset, and clear. The clock pulse width is usually quoted both for
the high state and for the low and is related to the maximum clocking frequency of the ﬂip-ﬂops used in the register.
