Antenna Parameters
Direct solutions to Maxwell’s equations or solutions dependent on approximations provide the analytic tools
for designing antennas. Ultimately, the analysis must be conﬁrmed with experiment. Increasingly sensitive radar
and other antenna applications have resulted in much more attention to edge effects (from the primary aperture,
secondary,  and/or  support  structures).  The  geometric  theory  of  diffraction  as  well  as  direct  Maxwell  solvers
are making important contributions.
