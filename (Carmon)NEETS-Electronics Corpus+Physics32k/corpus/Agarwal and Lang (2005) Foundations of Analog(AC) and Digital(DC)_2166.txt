Since Equation 15.81 is identical in form to Equation 12.119 for the RLC
circuit, we can readily determine the behavior of our RC active filter. Notice
that the output response vo of the Op Amp RC active filter corresponds to the
capacitor voltage vC in Section 12.5. The equation corresponding to the series
RLC circuit in Section 12.5 was
