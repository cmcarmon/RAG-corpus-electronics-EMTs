ideally suited for locating shorted or opened printed-circuit-board runs, wires, or components. In the
absence of a suitable pulsing current to drive the current tracer, a logic pulser or pulse generator may be
used as a signal source. The inherent disadvantage of a current tracer is that it requires an external power
supply. They can, however, be connected to the power supply of the equipment under test if the voltage is
correct.
