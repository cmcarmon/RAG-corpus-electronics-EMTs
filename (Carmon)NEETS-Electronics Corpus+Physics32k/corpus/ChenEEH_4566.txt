the proper fault detection and isolation. Many research activ-
ities have also been dedicated to investigate a proper residual
generation to facilitate the fault isolation process (Garcia and
Frank, 1999; Garcia et al., 1998; Gertler and Hu, 1999; Gertler
et al., 1995; Gertler and Kunwer, 1995). Generally speaking,
residual generation, statistical testing, and logical analysis are
usually combined as the three stages of the fault detection and
isolation (Gertler, 1988). Due to the inherent complexity of
nonlinear systems, most model-based analytical redundancy
fault diagnosis studies deal with the linear system that is
subject to simple additive or multiplicative faults. This as-
sumption has limited its effectiveness and usefulness in prac-
tical applications (Polycarpou and Helmicki, 1995; Polycarpou
and Vemuri, 1995). A series of research works that is devoted
to more general failure cases is reported in Polycarpou and
Helmicki (1995), Polycarpou and Vemuri (1995), Zhang et al.,
(1999, 2000), Vemuri and Polycarpou (1997) and Trunov and
Polycarpou (1999). Although signiÔ¨Åcant progress has been
made in the theoretical analysis for fault detection and sensi-
tivity conditions, more practical and complicated fault detec-
tion and diagnosis (FDD) problems, such as detection and
diagnosis of possible multiple failures, still remain to be solved.
