A variable pulse generator 
 
Figure 12.11 shows how a variable pulse generator 
can be constructed using two 555 timer (or one 556 
dual timer). The first timer, IC1, operates in astable 
mode  whilst  the  second  timer,  IC2,  operates  in 
monostable  mode.  The  p.r.f.  generated  by  IC1  is 
adjustable by  means of switch selected capacitors, 
C1 to C3, together  with variable resistor, VR1. The 
output from IC1 (pin-3) is fed via C5 to the trigger 
input of IC2 (pin-2).  
  The  monostable  period  of  IC2  is  adjustable  by 
means  of  switch  selected  capacitors,  C6 to  C8,
together  with  variable  resistor,  VR2. The  output 
from IC2 (pin-3) is fed to the output via VR3.
