The CURRENT LIMITER is a short-circuit protection device that automatically limits the current 
to a safe value. This is done when the current-limiting transistor senses an increase in load current. At this 
time the current-limiting transistor decreases the voltage on the base of the pass transistor in the regulator, 
causing a decrease in its conduction. Therefore, current cannot rise above a safe value.
