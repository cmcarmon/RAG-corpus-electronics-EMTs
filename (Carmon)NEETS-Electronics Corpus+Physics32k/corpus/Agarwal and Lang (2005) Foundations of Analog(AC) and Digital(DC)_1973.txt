To develop some insight concerning power and energy flow, let us examine
a few special cases. First, assume that the impedance in Figure 13.51 is a pure
resistance R. That is, X = 0. Further, we assume for simplicity that the time
origin is selected to make the voltage drive a cosine wave, that is, Ï† = 0 in
Equation 13.140. Then 13.149 is reduced to:
