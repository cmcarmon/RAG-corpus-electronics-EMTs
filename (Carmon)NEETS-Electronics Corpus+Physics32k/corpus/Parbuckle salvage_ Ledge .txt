The ledge was part steel and part grout. There were six steel platforms. The three larger platforms measured 35 by 40 meters (115 by 131 feet) each; the three smaller platforms measured 15 by 5 meters (49 by 16 feet) each. The 6 platforms were supported by 21 pillars of 1.6 meters (5.2 feet) diameter each and plunged for an average of 9 meters (30 feet) in the granite sea face of Giglio. The grout filled the space between the land side of the platforms and the sea bed. It totaled 1,180 individual bags with a volume of over 12,000 cubic meters (16,000 cubic yards) and over 16,000 metric tons (18,000 short tons) in weight. The grout bags contained an "ecofriendly cement," and were built with eyelets to aid post-recovery cleanup.
