Let R, U , and Y denote real vector spaces of dimensions
p, m, and p, respectively representing the spaces of requests,
plant inputs, and plant outputs. Let P: U ! Y denote an input
output description of a nonlinear plant. Deﬁne the desired
closed-loop response to a command by T : R ! Y and the
desired plant input for a command by M: R ! U. The oper-
ators P, T , M, and E are assumed to have Volterra series
