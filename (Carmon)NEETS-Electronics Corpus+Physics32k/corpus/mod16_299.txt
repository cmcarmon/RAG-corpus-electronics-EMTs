A stationary, permanent-magnet, moving-coil meter is the basic meter movement used in most
measuring instruments used for servicing electrical equipment. When current flows through the coil, a
resulting magnetic field reacts with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet and causes the movable
coil to rotate. The greater the intensity of current flow through the coil, the stronger the magnetic field
produced; the stronger the magnetic field produced, the greater the rotation of the coil. The
GALVANOMETER is an example of one type of stationary, permanent-magnet, moving-coil measuring
instrument.
