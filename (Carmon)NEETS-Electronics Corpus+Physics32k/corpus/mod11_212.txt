Practical tunnel-diode frequency converters usually have either a unity conversion gain or a small 
conversion loss. Conversion gains as high as 20 dB are possible if the tunnel diode is biased near or into 
the negative-resistance region. Although high gain is useful in some applications, it presents problems in 
stability. For example, the greatly increased sensitivity to variations in input impedance can cause high-
gain converters to be unstable unless they are protected by isolation circuitry.
