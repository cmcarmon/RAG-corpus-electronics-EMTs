An operating system, such as DOS, VMS, or UNIX, consisting of a set of system programs,
performs resource management and human-to-machine translation, supporting a given computer
architecture. Operations such as starting and stopping the execution, as well as selecting a speciÔ¨Åc
compiler or assembler for translating a given program into machine language, are taken care of by
the operating system, which is unique for a given microcomputer, minicomputer, or mainframe.
