The series combination of the 130-W resistor, T3, D3, and T4 in the circuit of Fig. 79.8(a), forming what is
called the totem-pole output circuit, provides a low impedance drive in both the source (output C = 1) and
sink  (output  C  =  0)  modes  and  contributes  signiﬁcantly  to  the  relatively  high  speed  of  TTL.  The  available
source and sink currents, which are well above the normal requirements for steady state, come into play during
the charging and discharging of capacitive loads. Ideally T3 should have a very large current gain and the 130-
W resistor should be reduced to 0. The latter, however, would cause a short-circuit load current which would
overheat T3, since T3 would be unable to saturate. All TTL families other than the standard shown in Fig. 79.8(a)
use some form of Darlington connection for T3, providing increased current gain and eliminating the need for
diode D3. The drop across D3 is replaced by the base emitter voltage of the added transistor T5. This connection
appears  in  Fig. 79.9(a),  an  example  of  the  74Hxx  series  of  TTL  gates  that  increases  speed  at  the  expense  of
increased power consumption, and in Fig. 79.9(b), a gate from the 74Lxx series that sacriﬁces speed to lower
power dissipation.
