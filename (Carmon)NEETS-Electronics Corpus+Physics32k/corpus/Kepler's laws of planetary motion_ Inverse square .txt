{\displaystyle {\frac {d(r^{2}{\dot {\theta }})}{dt}}=r(2{\dot {r}}{\dot {\theta }}+r{\ddot {\theta }})=ra_{\theta }=0.}

So the acceleration of a planet obeying Kepler's second law is directed towards the sun.

Kepler's first law states that the orbit is described by the equation:

This means that the acceleration vector

{\displaystyle \alpha =n^{2}a^{3}\,}

is a constant, and







r

^





{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}
is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and



r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the distance between the planet and the Sun.
According to Kepler's third law,



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.
The inverse square law is a differential equation. The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line. See Kepler orbit.
