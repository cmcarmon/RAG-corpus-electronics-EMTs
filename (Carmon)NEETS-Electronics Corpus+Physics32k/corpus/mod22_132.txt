Components or tools of a computer system are grouped into one of two categories, hardware or 
software. We refer to the machines that compose a computer system as hardware. This hardware includes 
all the mechanical, electrical, electronic, and magnetic devices within the computer itself (the central 
processing unit) and all related peripheral devices (printers, magnetic tape units, magnetic disk drive 
units, and so on). These devices will be covered in this chapter to show you how they function and how 
they relate to one another. Take a few minutes to study figure 2-1. It shows the functional units of a 
computer system: the  inputs, the central processing unit (cpu), and the outputs. The inputs can be on any 
storage medium from punched cards, paper tape, or magnetic ink to magnetic tape, disk, or drum; or they 
can be entries from a console keyboard or a cathode-ray tube (crt) terminal. The data from one or more of 
these inputs will be processed by the central processing unit to produce output. The output may be in 
punched cards or paper tape, on magnetic tape, disk, or drum, or it may be printed reports or information 
displayed on a console typewriter or crt terminal. The figure also shows the data flow, instruction flow, 
and flow of control. We'll start our hardware discussion with the cpu and then move into storage media 
(disk, tape, and drum). We'll end the chapter with a discussion of input/output devices and how they 
work.
