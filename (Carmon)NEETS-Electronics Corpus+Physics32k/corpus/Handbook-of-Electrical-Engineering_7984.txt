The carry equations can be realized by three-level combinational logic circuits to form the carry lookahead
logic block shown in Fig. 81.52(a). The sum (si) bits for the ith stage of an adder can be written in terms of gi,
pi, and ci and generated by the logic circuit given in Fig. 81.52(b). This completes the description of the four-
bit CLA.
