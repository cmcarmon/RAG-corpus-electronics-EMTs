One distinguishing characteristic of this structure is the air
gap at the bottom of the center section shown in Figure
1.13(A). If the length of the air gap is small with respect to
the cross-sectional dimensions, we can ignore ﬂux fringing (or
‘‘spreading out’’ of the B ﬁeld lines) in the air gap (Plonus,
1978). Consequently, this gap can be simply modeled as an-
other reluctance as indicated by R g in the equivalent magnetic
circuit of Figure 1.13(B).
