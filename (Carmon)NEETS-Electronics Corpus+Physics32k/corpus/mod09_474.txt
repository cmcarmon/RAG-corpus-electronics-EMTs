At T1, the positive alternation of the input gate ends, and Q1 returns to a forward-bias condition. A 
transistor that is near saturation has very low resistance, so C1 discharges rapidly between T1 and T2, as 
shown in figure 3-47, view (C). The capacitor discharges in less than 200 microseconds, the length of the 
negative alternation of the gate. The negative gate is made longer than the discharge time of the capacitor 
to ensure that the circuit has returned to its original condition.
