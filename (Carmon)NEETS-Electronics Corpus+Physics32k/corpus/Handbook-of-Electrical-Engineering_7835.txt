has a high magnetic coercivity1 and therefore does not respond to the externally applied ﬁeld. When a focused
beam raises the local temperature of the ﬁlm, the hot spot becomes magnetically soft (i.e., its coercivity drops).
As the temperature rises, coercivity drops continuously until such time as the ﬁeld of the electromagnet ﬁnally
overcomes the material’s resistance to reversal and switches its magnetization. Turning the laser off brings the
temperatures  back  to  normal,  but  the  reverse-magnetized  domain  remains  frozen  in  the  ﬁlm.  In  a  typical
situation in practice, the ﬁlm thickness may be around 300 Å, laser power at the disk .10 mW, diameter of
the focused spot .1 mm, laser pulse duration .50 ns, linear velocity of the track .10 m/s, and the magnetic
ﬁeld  strength  .200  gauss.  The  temperature  may  reach  a  peak  of  500  K  at  the  center  of  the  spot,  which  is
sufﬁcient for magnetization reversal, but is not nearly high enough to melt or crystalize or in any other way
modify the material’s structure.
