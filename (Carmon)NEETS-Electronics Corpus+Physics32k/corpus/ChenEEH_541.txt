since both electrons and holes are required for the band-to-
band recombination (just like the number of marriages in a
city should be proportional to both the number of eligible men
and to the number of eligible women). In practical
light-
emitting semiconductor devices, radiative band-to-impurity
recombination may be more important than radiative band-
to-band recombination. The radiative band-to-impurity re-
combination rate is given by:
