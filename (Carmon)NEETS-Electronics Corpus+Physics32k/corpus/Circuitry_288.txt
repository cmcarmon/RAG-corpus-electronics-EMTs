circuit).  The  output  of  the  rectifier  is  then  applied 
to a high-value reservoir  capacitor. This capacitor 
stores a considerable amount of charge and is being 
constantly  topped-up  by  the  rectifier  arrangement. 
The capacitor also helps to smooth out the voltage 
pulses  produced  by 
the  rectifier.  Finally,  a 
(often  based  on  a  series 
stabilizing  circuit 
transistor  regulator  and  a  zener  diode  voltage 
reference) provides a constant output voltage. We 
shall  now  examine  each  stage  of  this  arrangement 
in turn, building up to some complete power supply 
circuits at the end of the chapter.
