In addition to the short channel effects described above, the
scaling of the channel width can also have a large effect on the
threshold voltage, and its nature depends on the isolation
technology (Tsividis, 1999). In the case of LOCOS isolation,
the threshold voltage increases as the channel width decreases.
On the other hand, for shallow trench isolation, the threshold
voltage decreases as the channel width decreases. In todayâ€™s
technologies, shallow trench isolation is the predominant iso-
lation technique.
