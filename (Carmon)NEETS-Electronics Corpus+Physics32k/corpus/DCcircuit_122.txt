An electric circuit is formed when a conductive path is created to allow free electrons to contin-
uously move. This continuous movement of free electrons through the conductors of a circuit
is called a current, and it is often referred to in terms of ”ﬂow,” just like the ﬂow of a liquid
through a hollow pipe.
