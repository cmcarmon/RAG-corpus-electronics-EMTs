In the following, i and k range from 1 through 3.
The time–time component is the density of relativistic mass, i.e. the energy density divided by the speed of light squared. Its components have a direct physical interpretation. In the case of a perfect fluid this component is

is the relativistic mass per unit volume, and for an electromagnetic field in otherwise empty space this component is

The flux of relativistic mass across the xi surface is equivalent to the density of the ith component of linear momentum,

The components

In solid state physics and fluid mechanics, the stress tensor is defined to be the spatial components of the stress–energy tensor in the proper frame of reference. In other words, the stress energy tensor in engineering differs from the stress–energy tensor here by a momentum convective term.
