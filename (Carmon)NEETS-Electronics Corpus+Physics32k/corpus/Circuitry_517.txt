A byte of data can be stored at each address within 
the total memory space of a microprocessor system. 
Hence one byte can be stored at each of the 65,536 
memory  locations  within  a  microprocessor  system 
having a 16-bit address bus.   
 
Individual bits within a byte are numbered from 
0 (least significant bit) to 7 (most significant bit). In 
the  case  of  16-bit  words,  the  bits  are  numbered 
from 0 (least significant bit) to 15 (most significant 
bit).  
  Negative (or signed) numbers can be represented 
using  twoâ€™s  complement  notation  where 
the 
leading  (most  significant)  bit  indicates  the  sign  of 
the  number  (1  =  negative,  0  =  positive).  For 
example, 
the  signed  8-bit  number  10000001 
represents the denary number G1. 
  The  range  of  integer  data  values  that  can  be 
represented  as  bytes,  words  and  long  words  are 
shown in Table 11.2.
