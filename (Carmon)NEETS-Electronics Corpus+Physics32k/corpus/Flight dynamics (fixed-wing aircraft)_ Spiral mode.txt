In studying the trajectory, it is the direction of the velocity vector, rather than that of the body, which is of interest. The direction of the velocity vector when projected on to the horizontal will be called the track, denoted



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
(mu). The body orientation is called the heading, denoted



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
(psi). The force equation of motion includes a component of weight:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mu }{dt}}={\frac {Y}{mU}}+{\frac {g}{U}}\phi }


where g is the gravitational acceleration, and U is the speed.

Roll rates and yaw rates are expected to be small, so the contributions of




Y

r




{\displaystyle Y_{r}}
and




Y

p




{\displaystyle Y_{p}}
will be ignored.
The sideslip and roll rate vary gradually, so their time derivatives are ignored. The yaw and roll equations reduce to:

This is an exponential growth or decay, depending on whether the coefficient of



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is positive or negative. The denominator is usually negative, which requires

{\displaystyle L_{\beta }N_{r}>N_{\beta }L_{r}}
(both products are positive). This is in direct conflict with the Dutch roll stability requirement, and it is difficult to design an aircraft for which both the Dutch roll and spiral mode are inherently stable.
Since the spiral mode has a long time constant, the pilot can intervene to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll would be difficult to fly. It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable Dutch roll mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.
