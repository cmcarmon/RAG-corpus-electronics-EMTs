(op amp) circuit (corresponds to the device under test in Fig. 108.3) that was driven by a function generator
for the source, and that measured the response with an oscilloscope connected to the output of the op amp
using a 10X probe. In this application, the impedance of the interconnect between the source and op amp can
be neglected since the frequencies are low and the input impedance of the op amp is much greater than that
of  the  cable.  The  circuit  model  of  the  compensated  10X  probe  contains  a  very  high  series  impedance
