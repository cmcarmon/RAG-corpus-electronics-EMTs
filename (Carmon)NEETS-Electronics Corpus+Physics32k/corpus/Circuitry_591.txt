Frequency and wavelength 
 
Radio  waves  propagate  in  air  (or  space)  at  the 
speed of light (300 million metres per second). The 
velocity  of  propagation,  v, wavelength,  (cid:1), and 
frequency, f, of a radio wave are related by the 
equation: 
 
v = f (cid:1) = 3 Ã— 108
This  equation  can  be  arranged  to  make  f or  (cid:3) the 
subject, as follows:
