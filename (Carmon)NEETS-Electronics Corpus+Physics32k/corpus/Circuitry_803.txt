PIC families 
 
In  the  early  1990s,  PIC  microcontrollers  were 
grouped  in  three  families,  often  referred  to  as 
‘Base-Line’,  ‘Mid-Range’,  and  ‘High-End’.  Many 
of  these  devices  are  incompatible  with  the  latest 
development platforms and software tools. Despite 
this, it is usually possible to locate a modern device 
that  is  compatible  with  (and  will  generally  out-
perform) one of these early devices. 
  The base-line family comprised just four devices, 
which  all 
instructions.  The 
PIC16C54 and PIC16C56 were both 18-pin devices 
having 12 digital I/O lines. The PIC16C54 had 512 
× 12-bit  words  of  EPROM  program  memory, 
whilst the PIC16C56 had 1K × 12-bit words. Both 
of  these  devices  had  just  32  bytes  of  RAM  data 
memory 
control 
applications). The larger PIC16C55 and PIC16C57  
28-pin  devices  had  20  digital  I/O  lines.  The 
PIC16C55  had  512  ×  12-bit  words  of  EPROM 
program  memory  and  32  bytes  of  RAM  data
