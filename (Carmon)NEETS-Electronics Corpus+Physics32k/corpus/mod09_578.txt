At T3 the input and capacitor voltages are series aiding and the total output voltage is âˆ’50 volts. 
From T3 to T4, D1 is reverse biased and C discharges through R. The circuit operation is now the same as 
it was from T1 to T2. The circuit operation for the following square-wave cycles duplicates the operation 
which occurred from T1 to T3.
