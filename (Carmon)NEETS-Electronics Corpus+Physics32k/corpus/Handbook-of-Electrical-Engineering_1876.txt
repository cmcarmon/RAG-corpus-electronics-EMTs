Heterogeneous Multiprocessors
The  earliest  style  of  video  processor  is  the  heterogeneous  multiprocessor.  These  machines  cannot  execute
arbitrary programs â€” they are restricted to a single algorithm or variations on that algorithm. The microar-
chitecture of the machine is tuned to the target application. In the early days of digital video, special-purpose
heterogeneous multiprocessors were the only way to implement VLSI video processing because chips were not
large enough to support the hardware required for instruction-set processors. Today, heterogeneous multipro-
cessors  are  used  to  implement  low-cost  video  systems,  since  by  specializing  the  hardware  for  a  particular
application, less hardware is generally required, resulting in smaller, less-expensive chips.
