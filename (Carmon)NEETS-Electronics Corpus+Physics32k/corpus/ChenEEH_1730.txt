The current Internet infrastructure, however, behaves as a
‘‘best-effort’’ delivery system. Simply put, it makes an honest
attempt to deliver packets from a source to a destination, but it
provides no guarantees on the packet either being actually
delivered and/or the time it would take to deliver it (Kurose
and Ross, 2001). Although this behavior is appropriate for
textual data that require correct delivery rather than timely
delivery, it is not suitable for time-constraint multimedia data
such as video and audio. Recently, there has been a tremendous
growth in demand for distributed multimedia applications
over the Internet that operate by exchanging multimedia
involving a myriad of media types. These applications have
shown their value as powerful technologies that can enable
remote sharing of resources or interactive work collaborations,
thus
saving both time and money. Typical applications
of distributed multimedia systems include Internet-based
radio/television broadcast, video conferencing, video teleph-
ony, real-time interactive and collaborative work environ-
ments, video/audio on demand, multimedia mail, and distant
learning.
