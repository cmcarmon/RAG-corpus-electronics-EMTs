Bubble-Jet Printing. This technology has also been called thermal-jet. With this approach, very small thermal
resistors on the ink chamber wall are electrically pulsed. Joule heating of the resistor causes the temperature
of  the  ink  adjacent  to  the  heater  to  rise  to  350–400(cid:176)C  (see  Fig. 89.30).  Because  the  ink  becomes  locally
superheated, nucleation of tiny bubbles takes place on the surface over the heater. These bubbles coalesce and
very rapidly form a single expanding bubble which, by displacement (like a piston), propels a single drop of
ink out at the oriﬁce. The electrical pulse must be short (typically 3–6 ms) to insure low conductive heat losses;
however,  the  power  density  is  extremely  high  (~500  MW/m2).  The  energy  applied  per  drop  is  30–50 mJ  but
only a small fraction (a few percent) represents the kinetic energy of the drop. The remaining energy is thermally
dissipated in the ink and device structure.
