The reason for the increased change in plate current for a given change of plate voltage also has to do
with the space charge. With a higher plate voltage (over 150 volts), the attraction from the plate begins to
influence the DENSER part of the space charge that has greater numbers of electrons. Therefore, a higher
current flows for a given voltage than in the nonlinear part. The curve becomes steeper. In our example,
this linearity continues to about 300 volts, point B.
