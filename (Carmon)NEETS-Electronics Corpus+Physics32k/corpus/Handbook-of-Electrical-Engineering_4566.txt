Sampling Requirements
We may estimate the number of samples needed to adequately model the spatial, temporal, and angular variation
of the various quantities of interest in terms of an object characteristic length L and sampling dimension d.
This  may  be  done  from  knowledge  of  the  typical  spatial  and  temporal  densities  determined  from  computer
experiments and/or from invocation of Nyquist-like sampling rates for Ô¨Åeld variations in angle as a function
of aperture size. The resulting estimates are summarized in Table 45.11 and apply to both IE and DE models.
These may be regarded as wavelength-driven sampling rates, in contrast with the geometry-driven sampling
rates that can arise because of problem variations that are small in scale compared with l. Geometry-driven
sampling would affect primarily Nx, resulting in larger values than those indicated above.
