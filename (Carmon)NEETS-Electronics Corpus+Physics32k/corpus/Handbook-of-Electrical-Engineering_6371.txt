in that its design is based on the use of a frequency spectrum outside the AM and FM radio broadcast bands.
Out-band  operation  is  required  because  the  system  packs  up  to  16  stereophonic  broadcast  channels  (plus
auxiliary data) into one contiguous band of frequencies, which can occupy a total bandwidth of up to 4 MHz.
Thus,  overall  efÔ¨Åciency  is  maintained,  with  16  digital  program  channels  occupying  about  the  same  total
bandwidth as 16 equivalent analog FM broadcast channels. System developers have promoted Eureka-147/DAB
for satellite transmission, as well as for terrestrial applications in locations that have a suitable block of unused
spectrum in the L-band frequency range or below.
