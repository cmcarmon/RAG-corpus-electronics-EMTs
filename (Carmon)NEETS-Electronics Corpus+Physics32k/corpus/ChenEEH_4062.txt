In all cases, the formatting steps result in a sequence of
binary digits. These digits are transmitted through a baseband
channel, such as a pair of wires or a coaxial cable. However,
before we transmit the digits, we must transform the digits
into waveforms that are compatible with the channel. For
baseband channels, compatible waveforms are pulses. The
conversion from binary digits to pulse waveform takes place
in a wave encoder also called a baseband modulator. The
output of the waveform encoder is typically a sequence of
pulses with characteristics that correspond to the binary digits
being sent. After transmission through the channel, the re-
ceived waveforms are detected to produce an estimate of the
transmitted digits, and then the Ô¨Ånal step is (reverse) format-
ting to recover an estimate of the source information.
