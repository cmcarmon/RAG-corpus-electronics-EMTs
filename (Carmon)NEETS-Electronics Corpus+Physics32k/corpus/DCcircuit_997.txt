Note that electrical engineering texts are based on conventional current ﬂow. The loop-
current, mesh-current method in those text will run the assumed mesh currents clockwise.[1]
The conventional current ﬂows out the (+) terminal of the battery through the circuit, returning
to the (-) terminal. A conventional current voltage rise corresponds to tracing the assumed
current from (-) to (+) through any voltage sources.
