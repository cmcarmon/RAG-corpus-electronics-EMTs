The expression for the induced voltage or back EMF in a full-
pitched armature conductor is now formed (see Figure 4.11).
Full-pitched means that the coil spans one pole. Assume that
the ﬂux density in the air gap has a periodic spatial relation-
ship, and it may be expressed as:
B(a) ¼ B1 sin (a) þ B3 sin (3a) þ B5 sin (5a) þ . . .:
