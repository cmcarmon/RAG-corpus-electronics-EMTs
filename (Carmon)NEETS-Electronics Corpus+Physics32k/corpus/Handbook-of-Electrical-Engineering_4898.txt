Hole or hole state: When a conducting band, which can hold two electrons/unit cell, is more than half full,
the remaining unﬁlled states are called holes. Such a band responds to electric and magnetic ﬁelds as if
it contained positively charged carriers equal in number to the number of holes in the band.
