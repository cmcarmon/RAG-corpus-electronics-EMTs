Speed limit enforcement is the action taken by appropriately empowered authorities to check that road vehicles are complying with the speed limit. Methods used include roadside speed traps set up and operated by the police and automated roadside speed camera systems, which may incorporate the use of an automatic number plate recognition system.

The tolerance level needs to be adequate to not add confusion to the driver. One efficient scheme consist in penalty points and charges for speeding just a few over the speed limit.
Another possibility is to make the necessary work to change the road so that the driver can consider the speed limit is legitimate in regard to the road. This can be achieved by implementing traffic calming measure, vehicle activated signs, or safety cameras.
