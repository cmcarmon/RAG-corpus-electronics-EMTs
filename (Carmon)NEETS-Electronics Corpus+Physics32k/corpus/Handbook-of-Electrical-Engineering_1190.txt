A mapping that possesses these three properties is commonly referred to as an orthogonal projection operator.
The mapping PC designates the orthogonal projection of vector space X onto the closed subspace C. The term
orthogonal arises from the observation that every vector in subspace C is orthogonal to the associated error
vector x â€“ PC x. The concept of orthogonal projection operators is of fundamental importance in optimization
theory and has many important practical and theoretical implications.
