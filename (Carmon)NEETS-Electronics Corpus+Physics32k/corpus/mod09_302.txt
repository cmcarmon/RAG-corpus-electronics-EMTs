A high-gain transistor must be used with the three-section RC network because the losses in the 
network are high. Using more than three RC sections actually reduces the overall signal loss within the 
network. This is because additional RC sections reduce the phase shift necessary for each section, and the 
loss for each section is lowered as the phase shift is reduced. In addition, an oscillator that uses four or 
more RC networks has more stability than one that uses three RC networks. In a four-part RC network,
