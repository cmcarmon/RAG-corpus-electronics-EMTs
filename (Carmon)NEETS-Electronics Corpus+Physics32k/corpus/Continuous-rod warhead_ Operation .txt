When detonated, the high explosive imparts momentum to the rods, thrusting them outward in an expanding circle. The rods are sufficiently soft (ductile) to allow the expansion without breaking the rods or the welded joints, and the detonation velocity is limited to under 1,150 m/s, allowing the rods to bend at these locations instead. At some intermediate point the ring will have a zig-zag (alternating direction) appearance within a cylindrical envelope. Upon ultimate expansion the ring is circular and contained within a plane. The ring will then break and ultimately tend to form one or more straight rods. Since the net momentum of the rod relative to the missile is roughly zero its effectiveness will rapidly diminish as the broken ring expands.
This rapidly expanding ring, when hitting the aircraft, can be more effective than an equivalent fragmentation warhead: the ring's effectiveness decreases as 1/R, rather than 1/R2 for fragments. Although when designing the SAM missile equipped Mauler in the late 1950s, Monte Carlo simulations on the IBM 650 were conducted which influenced the decision to use a blast-fragmentation warhead, as a continuous-rod warhead was deemed likely to be less effective. Portions of the aircraft intercepted by the expanding ring of the continuous rod warhead will receive a continuous cut through the skin, light structure, underlying cables, hydraulic lines, and other plumbing if present. This may cause a structural failure, or, if not, can be sufficient for defeating the redundancy of aircraft systems. The effect is only pronounced as long as the ring is unbroken, so multiple layers of rods are employed in practical weapons to increase the effective radius.
