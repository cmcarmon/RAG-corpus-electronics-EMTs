Evening is the time of the day between daytime and night or between sunset and bedtime. There is no precise definition in terms of clock time, but it is considered to start around 5 p.m. and to last until nighttime or bedtime. Social and family activities are often held during this time, such as supper or more formal social gatherings and entertainment, such as parties, in particular dance parties. The word is derived from the Old English Ç£fnung, meaning "dusk falling, the time around sunset".
