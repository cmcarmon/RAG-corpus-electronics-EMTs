The program counter keeps track of the sequence 
of instructions to be executed. The instructions are 
stored in a program in memory. To begin the pro-
gram, the starting address (specific memory location) 
of the program is placed in the program counter. The 
first instruction is read from memory, decoded, and 
performed. The program counter then automatically 
moves to the next instruction location. Each time an 
instruction is fetched and executed, the program coun-
ter advances one step until the program is completed.
Some instructions specify a jump or branch to an-
other location in the program. The instruction register 
contains the address of the next instruction location 
and it is loaded into the address register.
