Some of the cards are being tested in different countries. Sweden, the leader for about 20 years, has been
using  a  patient  card  which  is  issued  at  birth  by  the  government  together  with  an  ID  number.  Sweden  has  a
socialized  medicine  program  and  it  has  been  in  their  best  interest  to  develop  uniform  standards  so  that  the
information can be accessed by every institution in the country. Belgium, Canada, France, Great Britain, Spain,
and Switzerland all have several systems on trial.
