Clocks and counters are found in all types of digital equipment. Although they provide different
functions, they are all constructed of circuits with which you are familiar. By changing the way the
circuits are interconnected, we can build timing circuits, multipliers and dividers, and storage units. In this
section we will discuss the purpose, construction, and operation of these important digital circuits.
