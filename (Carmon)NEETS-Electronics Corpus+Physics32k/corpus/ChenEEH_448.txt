in general, and in particular in BiCMOS technologies. Both
discrete and integrated solutions can be found. An example
for a standard integrated BJT implemented in a self-aligning
double-polysilicon process is shown in Figure 5.5 (Klose et al.,
1993; Yamaguchi et al., 1994). The self-alignment scheme allows
submicron emitter window widths bE0 with a mm-lithography
yielding transit frequencies fT of 25 GHz and beyond for present
production processes. Due to the recent trend to integrate BJTs
and silicon-germanium (SiGe) into BiCMOS processes, bipolar
transistors beneﬁt from the advanced CMOS lithography tools.
The tools enable a signiﬁcant reduction in parasitics and size
and, as a result, the transistors increase in speed ranging from
fT  30 GHz (Racanelli et al., 1999) up to  90 GHz (Freeman
et al., 1999), thus possibly even obviating the need for self-
alignment schemes. The structure in Figure 5.5 can be divided
into the internal transistor Ti (s. blow-up), the peripheral tran-
sistor Tp, and the external transistor regions.
