The force joystick operates by responding to pressure on the handle to generate the X–Y coordinates. It may
be either a two- or three-dimensional version, with the same types of handles as for the displacement joysticks.
However, it is difﬁcult to use a rotating handle for the third dimension because some force is usually transmitted
to  the  other  dimensions  causing  crosstalk.  Therefore,  a  separate  lever  is  preferred.  The  force  is  detected  by
means of piezoelectric sensors that are bonded to the handle rod, and a voltage source is applied across the
network,  as  shown  in  Fig. 89.11.  The  output  is  taken  from  the  strain  gauge  and  the  analog  voltage  will  be
proportional to the amount of force. The same type of protocol and output circuitry may be used as for the
displacement unit, and both can generate either position or rate data. An exponential curve with a dead zone
threshhold is preferred for pulse rates in order to avoid starting pulse rate uncertainties, with the ﬁrst pulse
starting as soon as the threshhold is exceeded.
