It should be noted from Eqs. (37.14) and (37.15) that E and H are everywhere perpendicular to each other
and also to the direction of wave propagation. Thus, the wave described by Eqs. (37.14) and (37.15) is said to
be plane-polarized, implying that the electric Ô¨Åeld is always parallel to the same plane (the xz-plane in this case)
and is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Also, as mentioned earlier, the wave decays as it travels
in the z-direction because of loss. This loss is expressed in the complex relative permittivity of the medium
