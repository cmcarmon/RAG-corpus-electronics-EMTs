You can see this relationship more clearly in figure 1-3 where the coil positions in relation to time 
are represented by the numbers 0 through 12. The corresponding angular displacements, shown as !, are 
shown along the horizontal time axis. The induced voltages (V1 through V12) are plotted along this axis. 
Connecting the induced voltage points, shown in the figure, forms a sine-wave pattern. This relationship 
can be proven by taking any coil position and applying the trigonometric function to an equivalent right 
triangle. When the vector is placed horizontally (position 0), the angle ! is 0 degrees. Since e = Emax sine 
!, and the sine of 0 degrees is 0, the output voltage is 0 volts, as shown below:
