Variable	resistors allow the resistance to vary. 
They have a resistive element of either carbon com‑
position or wire that is connected to two terminals. A 
third terminal is attached to a movable wiper, which 
is connected to a shaft. The wiper slides along the 
resistive element when the shaft is rotated. As the 
shaft is rotated, the resistance between the center 
terminal and one outer terminal increases, whereas 
the resistance between the center terminal and the 
other outer terminal decreases (Figure 13‑10). Vari‑
able resistors are available with resistance that varies 
linearly (a linear taper) or logarithmically (an audio 
taper).
