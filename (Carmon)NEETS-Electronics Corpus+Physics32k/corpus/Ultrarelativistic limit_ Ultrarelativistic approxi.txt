Below are some ultrarelativistic approximations in units with c = 1. The rapidity is denoted φ:
1 − v ≈ ​1⁄2γ2
E − p = E(1 − v) ≈ ​m2⁄2E = ​m⁄2γ
φ ≈ ln(2γ)
Motion with constant proper acceleration: d ≈ eaτ/(2a), where d is the distance traveled, a = dφ/dτ is proper acceleration (with aτ ≫ 1), τ is proper time, and travel starts at rest and without changing direction of acceleration (see proper acceleration for more details).
Fixed target collision with ultrarelativistic motion of the center of mass: ECM ≈ √2E1E2} where E1 and E2 are energies of the particle and the target respectively (so E1 ≫ E2), and ECM is energy in the center of mass frame.
