A disadvantage of either technique, though, is the fact that both result in a ﬁxed resistance
value. In a perfect world where meter movements never lose magnetic strength of their per-
manent magnets, where temperature and time have no effect on component resistances, and
where wire connections maintain zero resistance forever, ﬁxed-value resistors work quite well
for establishing the ranges of precision instruments. However, in the real world, it is advanta-
geous to have the ability to calibrate, or adjust, the instrument in the future.
