Antenna system testing is one of the more common and useful applications for using the swept-
frequency technique. The main parameters that an antenna system is tested for are vswr, frequency 
response, and impedance. Figure 5-31 shows a typical test setup for testing a transmitting antenna for 
vswr. Remember that any transmitting antenna can also act as a receiving antenna and send induced 
power from adjacent antennas back to the test equipment. You should make an initial power check on the 
antenna to prevent damage to your test equipment. Figure 5-32 shows a typical hf transmitting antenna 
vswr display as measured using the swept-frequency technique. The setup for testing a receiving antenna 
vswr, shown in figure 5-33, is similar, with the exception of the attenuators. The measured vswr (within 
the operating frequency range) of any broadband antenna should not exceed a vswr of 2.5 to 1. The vswr 
for any single-tuned antenna should not exceed 1.5 to 1 at the tuned frequency.
