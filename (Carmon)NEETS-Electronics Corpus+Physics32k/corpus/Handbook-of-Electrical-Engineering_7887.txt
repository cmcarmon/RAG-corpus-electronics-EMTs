Synchronous Sequential Logic Circuits
Synchronous sequential logic circuits change states only at the rising or falling edge of the synchronous clock
signal. To allow proper circuit operation, any external input signals to the synchronous sequential logic circuit
must  generate  excitation  inputs  that  occur  with  the  proper  setup  time  (tsu)  and  hold  time  (th)  requirements
relative to the designated clock edge for the memory elements being used. Synchronous or clock-mode sequen-
tial logic circuits depend on the present state of memory devices called bistables or ﬂip-ﬂops (asynchronous
sequential logic circuits) that are driven by a system clock as illustrated by the synchronous sequential logic
circuit in Fig. 81.23.
