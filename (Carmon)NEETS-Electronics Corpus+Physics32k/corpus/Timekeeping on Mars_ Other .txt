With the location of Airy-0 now known much more precisely than when these missions landed, it is technically feasible for future missions to use a convenient offset from Airy Mean Time, rather than completely non-standard time zones. Although there are currently no official timezone system for Mars other than AMT/MTC, Ares Astronautics has also put forward a solution to this problem based upon the USGS Martian Quadrangles officially known as the Arean Time Zone System.
