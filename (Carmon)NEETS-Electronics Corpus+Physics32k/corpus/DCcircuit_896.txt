The design and operational theory of pH electrodes is a very complex subject, explored only
brieï¬‚y here. What is important to understand is that these two electrodes generate a voltage
directly proportional to the pH of the solution. At a pH of 7 (neutral), the electrodes will
produce 0 volts between them. At a low pH (acid) a voltage will be developed of one polarity,
and at a high pH (caustic) a voltage will be developed of the opposite polarity.
