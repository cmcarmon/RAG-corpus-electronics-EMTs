Testing resistors
Resistors are components that limit current through a circuit. (Refer to 
Chapter 5 for details.) Sometimes you need to verify that the nominal resis-
tance value marked on the body of a resistor is accurate, or you may want to 
investigate whether a suspicious‐looking resistor with a bulging center and 
third‐degree burns has gone bad.
