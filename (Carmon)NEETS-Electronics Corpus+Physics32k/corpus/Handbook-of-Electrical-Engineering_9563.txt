Knowledge Acquisition
After the problem is carefully selected and scoped, the next step is knowledge acquisition. Knowledge acquisition
involves  eliciting  knowledge  from  an  expert  or  multiple  experts  and  also  using  available  documentation,
regulations,  manuals,  and  other  written  reports  to  facilitate  the  knowledge  acquisition  process.  The  biggest
bottleneck  in  expert  systems  development  has,  thus  far,  been  in  the  ability  to  acquire  knowledge.  Various
automated knowledge acquisition tools, such as Boeing Computer Servicesâ€™ AQUINAS, have been developed
to assist in this process, but there are very few knowledge acquisition tools on the market. The most commonly
used approaches for acquiring/eliciting knowledge include: interviewing (structured and unstructured), pro-
tocol  analysis,  questionnaires  (structured  and  open-ended),  observation,  learning  by  example/analogy,  and
other various techniques (Delphi technique, statistical methods).
