The thesis of this theorem of classical mechanics reads exactly as the heat theorem of thermodynamics. This fact shows that thermodynamic-like relations exist between certain mechanical quantities in multidimensional ergodic systems. This in turn allows to define the "thermodynamic state" of a multi-dimensional ergodic mechanical system, without the requirement that the system be composed of a large number of degrees of freedom. In particular the temperature



T


{\displaystyle T}
is given by twice the time average of the kinetic energy per degree of freedom, and the entropy



S


{\displaystyle S}
by the logarithm of the phase space volume enclosed by the constant energy surface (i.e. the so-called volume entropy).
