With the ammeter disconnected from this circuit, the current through the 3 Ω resistor would
be 666.7 mA, and the current through the 1.5 Ω resistor would be 1.33 amps. If the ammeter
had an internal resistance of 1/2 Ω, and it were inserted into one of the branches of this circuit,
though, its resistance would seriously affect the measured branch current:
