Conversely, if a very light load (1 mA) were to be connected to the battery, our equation
would tell us that the battery should provide power for 70,000 hours, or just under 8 years (70
amp-hours / 1 milliamp), but the odds are that much of the chemical energy in a real battery
would have been drained due to other factors (evaporation of electrolyte, deterioration of elec-
trodes, leakage current within battery) long before 8 years had elapsed. Therefore, we must
take the amp-hour relationship as being an ideal approximation of battery life, the amp-hour
rating trusted only near the speciÔ¨Åed current or timespan given by the manufacturer. Some
manufacturers will provide amp-hour derating factors specifying reductions in total capacity
at different levels of current and/or temperature.
