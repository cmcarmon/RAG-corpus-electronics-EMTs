TUNNEL-DIODE AMPLIFIERS.â€”Low-noise, tunnel-diode amplifiers represent an important 
microwave application of tunnel diodes. Tunnel-diode amplifiers with frequencies up to 85 gigahertz have 
been built in waveguides, coaxial lines, and transmission lines. The low-noise generation, gain ratios of 
up to 30 dB, high reliability, and light weight make these amplifiers ideal for use as the first stage of 
amplification in communications and radar receivers.
