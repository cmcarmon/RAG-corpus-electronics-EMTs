An exact relation for the mass flux of a nonlinear periodic wave on an inviscid fluid layer was established by Levi-Civita in 1924. In a frame of reference according to Stokes' first definition of wave celerity, the mass flux




M

w




{\displaystyle M_{w}}
of the wave is related to the wave's kinetic energy density




E

k




{\displaystyle E_{k}}
(integrated over depth and thereafter averaged over wavelength) and phase speed



c


{\displaystyle c}
through:





M

w

E

.


{\displaystyle M_{w}={\frac {2E_{k}}{c}}.}

Similarly, Longuet Higgins showed in 1975 that – for the common situation of zero mass flux towards the shore (i.e. Stokes' second definition of wave celerity) – normal-incident periodic waves produce a depth- and time-averaged undertow velocity:

,


{\displaystyle {\bar {u}}=-{\frac {2E_{k}}{\rho ch}},}

with



h


{\displaystyle h}
the mean water depth and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
the fluid density. The positive flow direction of






u
¯





{\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
is in the wave propagation direction.
For small-amplitude waves, there is equipartition of kinetic (




E

k




{\displaystyle E_{k}}
) and potential energy (




E

p




{\displaystyle E_{p}}
):

{\displaystyle E_{w}=E_{k}+E_{p}\approx 2E_{k}\approx 2E_{p},}

with




E

w




{\displaystyle E_{w}}
the total energy density of the wave, integrated over depth and averaged over horizontal space. Since in general the potential energy

{\displaystyle {\bar {u}}\approx -{\frac {1}{8}}{\frac {gH^{2}}{ch}}.}

For irregular waves the required wave height is the root-mean-square wave height

{\displaystyle H_{\text{rms}}\approx {\sqrt {8}}\;\sigma ,}
with



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

The distribution of the undertow velocity over the water depth is a topic of ongoing research.
