Ã˜rsted found that, for a straight wire carrying a steady (DC) current
The magnetic field lines encircle the current-carrying wire
The magnetic field lines lie in a plane perpendicular to the wire
If the direction of the current is reversed, the direction of the magnetic field reverses.
The strength of the field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the current.
The strength of the field at any point is inversely proportional to the distance of the point from the wire.
