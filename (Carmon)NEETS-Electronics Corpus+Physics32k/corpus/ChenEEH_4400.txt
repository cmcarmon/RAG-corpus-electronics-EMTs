is diag {ss(v) ¼ s1(v), s2(v), . . . ,
where S(v) 2 Cpp
sp(v) ¼ s(v)} and where Y (v) and U (v) 2 Cpp are unitary
matrices (see Section 9, Chapter 1). The diagonal entries of
S(v) are called the singular values of G(s), and they depend on
frequency. They are ordered from the largest to the smallest.
Now, rewrite (equation 3.18 in terms of the columns of
Y (v) and U (v), and let Y (v) ¼ [y1(v) yp(v)] and
U (v) ¼[u1(v) up(v)]. Since the columns of U (v) form
an orthonormal basis of Cp, let a be the representation of u
with respect to {u1(v), . . . , up(v)}. Substituting u ¼ U (v)a in
equation 3.18 gives the following:
