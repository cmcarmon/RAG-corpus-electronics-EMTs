Data Links
A data link consists of a transmitter (T) that converts electrical pulses to optical pulses (E/O) and sends the
optical pulses on an optical ﬁber to a receiver (R) which converts the optical pulses back to electrical pulses
(O/E). The transmitter may use a light-emitting diode (LED) or a laser diode (LD) as the optical source. The
LED is cheaper but has lower output power into the ﬁber (~10 mW vs. ~1 mW), lower modulation bandwidths
(~100 Mb/s vs. ~1 Gb/s), and wider optical spectrum, leading to chromatic dispersion due to the variation of
optical velocity in the ﬁber with wavelength. Pulse dispersion limits BL when the pulse spreading approaches
a  bit  period.  The  receiver  may  employ  a  PIN  (positive-intrinsic-negative)  or  APD  (avalanche  photodiode)
photodetector. The former is cheaper and easier to bias but has poorer sensitivity by about 5 dB. The sensitivity
of a good PIN receiver is about –50 dBm at 100 Mb/s and –35 dBm at 1 Gb/s for a bit-error-rate (BER) of 10–9.
Optical devices operating at a wavelength of ~0.87 mm use gallium-aluminum-arsenide materials and are less
expensive  than  those  operating  at  1.3  or  1.5  mm  and  using  indium-gallium-arsenide-phosphide  materials.
However, for 1.5 mm, the ﬁber attenuation and, for 1.3 mm, the chromatic dispersion is much less than for 0.87
mm. The ﬁber joining transmitter and receiver may be multimode or single mode. Multimode (with a typical
core  diameter  of  62.5 mm)  is  cheaper,  but  since  each  mode  travels  at  a  different  optical  velocity,  the  modal
dispersion further limits BL. The LED data links generally employ multimode ﬁber, and the combination of
chromatic  and  modal  dispersion  limits BL  to  values  below  ~1  Gb/ s·km.  For  an  LD,  single-mode  ﬁber  (core
diameter ~10 mm) data link, BL of ~100 Gb/ s·km is possible.
