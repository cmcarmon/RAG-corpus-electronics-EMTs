Starting from the early 1990s, a UNIX clone, Linux, was
available for free on numerous personal computers with its
source code open to the user community. Linux is written from
scratch by Linus Torvalds with the assistance of a loosely-knit
team of hackers from across the Internet. It aims toward POSIX
compliance and has all of the features one would expect of a
modern, fully ï¬‚edged UNIX: true multitasking, virtual memory,
shared libraries, TCP/IP networking, and, most importantly,
device drivers for most available hardware components.
