Note that a ¼ q=nkT , with q the charge of an electron, n as
the ideality factor, Is the saturation current, and k as Boltz-
mann’s constant. Assume that V contains a dc voltage term,
V0, and a small signal ac signal, v, which may contain one or
more frequency components. The current can be expanded in
a Taylor series. Considering only the ﬁrst three terms, the
expansion becomes:
