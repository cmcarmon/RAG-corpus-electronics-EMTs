The semiconductor test set (fig. 2-4) is a rugged, field type of tester designed to test transistors and
semiconductor diodes. The set measures the beta of a transistor, resistance appearing at the electrodes,
reverse current of a transistor or semiconductor diode, shorted or open conditions of a diode, forward
transconductance of a field-effect transistor, and condition of its own batteries.
