Before the Cavendish Experiment, attempts to "weigh" Earth involved estimating the mean density of Earth and its volume. The volume was well understood through surveying techniques, and the density was measured by observing the slight deflection of a pendulum near a mountain, as in the Schiehallion experiment. The Earth mass could then be calculated as:





M

⊕


=
ρ
V


{\displaystyle M_{\oplus }=\rho V}
.
This technique resulted in a mass estimate that is 20% lower than today's accepted value.
