In this equation k is Boltzmann’s constant, m is the carrier mobility, which is actually a complex function of
the doping, n, p, electric ﬁeld, temperature, and other factors. In silicon the electron mobility will range between
50  and  1000  and  the  hole  mobility  will  normally  be  a  factor  of  2  smaller.  In  other  semiconductors  such  as
gallium  arsenide  the  electron  mobility  can  be  as  high  as  5000.  Tn  and  Tp  are  the  electron  and  hole  mean
temperatures, which describe the average carrier energy. In many models these default to the device temperature
(300 K). In the ﬁrst term the current is proportional to the electric ﬁeld ((cid:209)Y), and this term represents the
drift of carriers with the electric ﬁeld. In the second term the current is proportional to the gradient of the
carrier concentration ((cid:209)n), so this term represents the diffusion of carriers from regions of high concentration
to those of low concentration. The model is therefore called the drift-diffusion model.
