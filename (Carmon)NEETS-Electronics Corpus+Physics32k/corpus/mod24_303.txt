Figure 3-15 shows an isometric view of a four-fiber shipboard OFCC cable. In this multifiber cable
design, the OFCCs surround a flexible central member in a helical manner. The central member may add
to cable strength or only support the OFCCs. For additional protection, two layers of arimid yarn strength
members encase the OFCC units. These strength members are stranded in opposing lays to minimize
microbending of the fibers. The arimid yarn strength members may be treated with polymers that are
water absorbing, blocking, and sealing. This treatment eliminates the need for additional water blocking
protection. Finally, a low-halogen, flame-resistant outer jacket is extruded over the strength members.
