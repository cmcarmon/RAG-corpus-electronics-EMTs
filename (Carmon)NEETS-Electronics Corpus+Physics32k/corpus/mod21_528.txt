Circuit impedance is measured conveniently by using the reflectometer principle. The individual 
values of the incident and reflected signals (swr) in a transmission line feeding an unknown impedance 
are measured. The ratio between these signals indicates how closely the load impedance matches that of 
the transmission line.
