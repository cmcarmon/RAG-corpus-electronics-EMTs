EXamPlE:	 What is the value of  R2in the circuit 
shown in Figure 14-18?
First solve for the current that flows through R1 and R3. 
Because the voltage is the same in each branch of a par-
allel circuit, each branch voltage is equal to the source 
voltage of 120 volts.
Given	
 IR1 5 ?
 ER1 5 120 volts
 R1 5 1000 ohms
