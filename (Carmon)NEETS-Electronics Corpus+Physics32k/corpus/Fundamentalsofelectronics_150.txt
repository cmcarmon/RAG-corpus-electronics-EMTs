.
combination of R1 and R2 has the v-i relation of a resistor having resistance
R1 + R2
A shorthand notation for this quantity is (R1 (cid:107) R2). As the reciprocal of resistance is conductance, we can
say that for a parallel combination of resistors, the equivalent conductance is the sum of the
conductances.
