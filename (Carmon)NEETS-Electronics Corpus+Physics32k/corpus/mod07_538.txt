The figures used in the explanation of voltage multipliers show a transformer input, even though for 
some applications a transformer is not necessary. The input could be directly from the power source or 
line voltage. This, of course, does not isolate the equipment from the line and creates a potentially 
hazardous condition. Most military equipments use transformers to minimize this hazard.
