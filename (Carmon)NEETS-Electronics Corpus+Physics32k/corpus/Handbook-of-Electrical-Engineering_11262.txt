Application of computers to the ECG for machine interpretation was one of the earliest uses of computers
in  medicine  [Jenkins,  1981].  Of  primary  interest  in  the  computer-based  systems  was  the  replacement  of  the
human reader and the elucidation of the standard waves and intervals. Originally this was performed by linking
the ECG machine to a centralized computer via phone lines. The modern ECG machine is completely integrated
with an analog front end, a 12- to 16-bit A/D converter, a computational microprocessor, and dedicated I/O
processors. These systems compute a measurement matrix derived from the 12 lead signals and analyze this
matrix with a set of rules to obtain the ﬁnal set of interpretive statements. The depiction of the 12 analog signals
and this set of interpretive statements form the ﬁnal output, with an example shown in Fig. 115.7. The physician
will over-read each ECG and modify or correct those statements which are deemed inappropriate. The larger
hospital-based system will record these corrections and maintain a large database of all ECGs accessible by any
combination of parameters, e.g., all males, older than 50, with an inferior myocardial infarction.
