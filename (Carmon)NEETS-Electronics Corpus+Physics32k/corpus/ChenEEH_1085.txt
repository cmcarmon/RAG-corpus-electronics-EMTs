Computer-aided design (CAD) software is necessary not only
for the design of systems and devices that go into MEMS
devices but also for the simulation of their expected behavior.
Design of MEMS devices is markedly different from the design
of integrated circuits. For MEMS devices, the designer should
be completely aware of the processing steps and of the mater-
ials to be used and their properties. This is in contrast to the
design of integrated circuits, in which case the design and the
processing steps are separate, and the designer does not have to
know the exact details of the process steps. However, for
MEMS devices design, the designer has to make many deci-
sions, some determined by processing, and be aware of many
constraints to realize the desired device.
