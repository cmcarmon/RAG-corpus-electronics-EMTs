Before making a measurement, you must zero the ohmmeter to ensure accurate readings. This is
accomplished by shorting the leads together and adjusting the OHMS ADJ control so that the pointer is
pointing directly at the zero mark on the OHMS scale. The ZERO OHMS control is continuously variable
and is used to adjust the meter circuit sensitivity to compensate for battery aging in the ohmmeter circuits.
