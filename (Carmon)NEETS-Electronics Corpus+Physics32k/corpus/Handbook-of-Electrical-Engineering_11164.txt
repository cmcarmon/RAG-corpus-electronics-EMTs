There are other types of ion-selective membrane potentiometric chemical sensors that are used for biomedical
applications. The membranes of these sensors determine the ion being sensed. The membrane can be based
upon glass or a polymeric material such as polyvinyl chloride, but the key component is the substance that is
added to the membrane that allows it to selectively pass a single ion.
