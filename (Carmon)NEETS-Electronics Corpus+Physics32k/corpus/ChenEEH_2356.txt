A dielectric-ﬁlled metallic waveguide has the same property
as an air-ﬁlled metallic waveguide with the only exception: the
cutoff frequency for the modes is lower due to the presence of
the dielectric (e > 1 or m > 1) as seen from equation 5.18.
A schematic view of this type of guide is given in Figure 5.5.
