Signal processing deals with operations performed on a signal
with the intent of either modifying it in some desirable way or
extracting useful information from it. Signal processing en-
compasses the theory, design, and practice of software and
hardware for converting signals produced by different sources
into a form that allows a more effective utilization of the signal
content. The signals might be speech, music, image, video,
multimedia data, biological signals, sensor data, telemetry,
electrocardiograms, or seismic data. Typical objectives of
processing include manipulation, enhancement, transmission,
storage, visualization, detection, estimation, diagnosis, classiﬁ-
cation, segmentation, or interpretation. Signal processing ﬁnds
applications in many areas, such as in telecommunications,
consumer electronics, medical imaging and instrumentation,
remote sensing, space research, oil exploration, radar, sonar,
and biometrics (Anastassiou, 2001; Baillet et al., 2001; Ebra-
