A native system of weights and measures was used by Tatars until 1924, but became obsolete when the Soviet Union adopted the metric system.
The Tatar system shares many units with the Russian system (e.g. sajın and disätinä), which is close to the English (The Russian system existed since ancient Rus', but under Peter the Great, the Russian units were redefined relative to the English system.), therefore a duym is relatively equal to an inch. This list includes their Tatar language names.
