Everything — even the best conductors — exhibits a certain amount of resis­
tance to the flow of electrons. (Well, actually, certain materials, called super-
conductors, can conduct current with zero electrical resistance — but only 
if you cool them down to extremely low temperatures. You won’t encounter 
them in conventional electronics.) The higher the resistance, the more 
restricted the flow of current.
