Oxygen diffusion-enhancing compounds are thought to act by exerting hydrophobic forces that interact with water molecules. These interactions result in greater hydrogen bonding among water molecules, which constitute the majority of the blood plasma medium. As hydrogen bonding increases, the overall molecular structure of water in the plasma becomes more lattice-like, a phenomenon known as structure building. Structure building reduces resistance to the movement of oxygen through plasma via diffusion. Since blood plasma offers the major barrier for oxygen to move from the red blood cells and into the tissues, the more structured character of water imparted by the oxygen diffusion-enhancing compound will enhance movement into tissues.
Computer simulations have shown that TSC specifically can increase the transport of oxygen through water by as much as 30 percent.
