The model 250DE bridge has a battery supply consisting of four 1.5 V dc batteries with an expected
life of 500 hours. The battery power supply should be checked before each dayâ€™s operation. Turn DET
GAIN control to 1 and set GEN-DET switch to BATT. TEST (battery test). If the meter deflects beyond
the BAT OK mark, the battery is good.
