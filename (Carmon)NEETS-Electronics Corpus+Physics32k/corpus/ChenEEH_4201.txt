The nature of a local network is very closely tied to the
technologies it uses. The key technologies are the topology,
transmission medium, and MAC protocol. Unlike a wide area
network (WAN), LAN is a shared medium network, and the
choice of a transmission medium impacts the topology it can
use. These key technologies are closely related to each other.
For example, a twisted pair medium is more suitable for the
star topology. Each type of technology is described in separate
subsection in this chapter.
