b) A common method of coping with the errors of part (a) is to use a compensated
attenuator in series with the scope (see in Figure 10.123.) For simplicity, we examine
what the compensated scope displays when it is connected directly to the unit step
without the R1 − C1 circuit of part (a). Assume zero initial state before the step is
applied.
i) What is vB immediately after the step is applied, that is, at t = 0
+
ii) What is vB as t → ∞?
