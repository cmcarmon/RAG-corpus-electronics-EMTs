There is meaning in the letter sequences used to identify conductor types, and these letters
usually refer to properties of the conductor’s insulating layer(s). Some of these letters symbol-
ize individual properties of the wire while others are simply abbreviations. For example, the
letter ”T” by itself means ”thermoplastic” as an insulation material, as in ”TW” or ”THHN.”
However, the three-letter combination ”MTW” is an abbreviation for Machine Tool Wire, a type
of wire whose insulation is made to be ﬂexible for use in machines experiencing signiﬁcant
motion or vibration.
