To  initiate  the  development  of  a  thermal  design  for  a  speciﬁed  electronic  product,  it  is  ﬁrst  necessary  to
deﬁne  the  relevant  packaging  level.  The  commonly  accepted  categorization  places  the  chip  package,  which
houses  and  protects  the  chip,  at  the  bottom  of  the  packaging  hierarchy  (Level 1),  the  printed  circuit  board,
which provides for chip-to-chip interconnect, as Level 2, the backplane, or “motherboard,” which interconnects
the printed circuit boards, as Level 3, and deﬁnes the box, rack, or cabinet, which houses the entire system, as
Level 4.
