KCL has a simple intuitive justification. Referring to the closed box-like
surface depicted in Figure 2.5, it is easy to see that the currents ia, ib, and ic
must sum to zero, for otherwise, there would be a continuous charge buildup
at node a. Thus, KCL is simply a statement of the conservation of charge.
