When middleware is used as the basis for integrating appli-
cations, it can be seen as a software substrate. To be effective
and easy to use as a substrate, middleware should have certain
properties. First, it must have a standard interface so that all
application software programs that use the standard can be
integrated easily. Second, it must have heterogeneous inter-
operability, that is, be able to integrate application software
that is written in different languages and/or running on differ-
ent processor platforms. The ultimate goal for control systems
would be to have middleware that has plug-and-play capabil-
ity. Also, for adaptability sake, it would be helpful to have run-
time reconﬁguration of the software components (such as
updating or changing algorithms online in real-time). The
control engineering ﬁeld is not yet to this point in its use of
middleware. More discussion of the available products is given
in the last section of this chapter; ﬁrst, more fundamental
concepts on software engineering are introduced.
