The vvR(u, f) is called the receive vector, and the unit vector
^rrR(u, f) is called the receive polarization unit vector. Like the
radiation and incident polarization unit vectors ^rr and ^rri, the
receive polarization unit vector may be transformed to a new
coordinate system (^uuR, ^ffR) aligned with the major and minor
axes of the receive polarization ellipse. The angle between the ^uu
and ^uuR axes is the tilt angle gR:
R þ zRjbR
^rrR ¼ ejaR ^rr0
R ¼ ejaR (aR
^ff0
^uu0
R);
R ¼ ^rr:
aR, bR  0, aR  bR, ^uu0
R  ^ff0
zR ¼ þ1 for LHP receiver;
zR ¼ -1 for RHP receiver:
