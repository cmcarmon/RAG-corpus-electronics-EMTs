Experimental methods to determine MSDs include neutron scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy.
The linear relationship between the MSD and time t allows for graphical methods to determine the diffusivity constant D. This is especially useful for rough calculations of the diffusivity in environmental systems. In some atmospheric dispersion models, the relationship between MSD and time t is not linear. Instead, a series of power laws empirically representing the variation of the square root of MSD versus downwind distance are commonly used in studying the dispersion phenomenon.
