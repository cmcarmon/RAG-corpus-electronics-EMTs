Two typical applications that require a large number of pure qubits are quantum error correction (QEC) and ensemble computing. In realizations of quantum computing (implementing and applying the algorithms on actual qubits), algorithmic cooling was involved in realizations in optical lattices. In addition, algorithmic cooling can be applied to in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
