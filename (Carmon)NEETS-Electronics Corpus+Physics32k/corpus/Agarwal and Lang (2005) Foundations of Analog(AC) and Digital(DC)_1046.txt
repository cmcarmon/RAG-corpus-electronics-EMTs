e n t i a l a m p l i f i e r This example studies the differential amplifier shown in
Figure 7.62. Differential amplifiers are widely used in analog signal processing, and are
the heart of operational amplifiers. The applications of differential amplifiers are best
discussed in the context of small signal analysis, and so we defer a detailed discussion of
the applications until Chapter 8. Furthermore, a complete operational amplifier circuit
will be studied in detail in Example 7.21, and operational amplifier applications will be
discussed in Chapter 15. So for the present purposes, we will simply treat the amplifier
in Figure 7.62 as yet another example of a MOSFET amplifier.
