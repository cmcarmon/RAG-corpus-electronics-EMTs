A high percentage of technical manuals contain point-to-point resistance charts that list correct
resistance readings for major test points. These resistance charts are extremely useful when you
troubleshoot faulty equipment. Without them, equipment resistance measurements within a complicated
circuit would not mean much. Many circuits contain other circuit elements, such as capacitors, coils, or
other resistors in parallel with the resistances being measured. This, of course, is a possible source of
measurement error that you eliminate when you disconnect or unsolder one side of the resistor or a group
of resistors under test.
