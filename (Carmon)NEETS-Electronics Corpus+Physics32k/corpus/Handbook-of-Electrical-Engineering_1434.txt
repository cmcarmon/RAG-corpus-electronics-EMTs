Homomorphic (Cepstral) Analysis
For  the  speech  model  of  Fig. 15.6,  the  excitation  and  ﬁlter  impulse  response  are  convolved  to  produce  the
speech. One of the problems of speech analysis is to separate or deconvolve the speech into these two compo-
nents. One such technique is called homomorphic ﬁltering [Oppenheim and Schafer, 1968]. The characteristic
system for a system for homomorphic deconvolution converts a convolution operation to an addition operation.
The output of such a characteristic system is called the complex cepstrum. The complex cepstrum is deﬁned
as the inverse Fourier transform of the complex logarithm of the Fourier transform of the input. If the input
sequence is minimum phase (i.e., the z-transform of the input sequence has no poles or zeros outside the unit
circle), the sequence can be represented by the real portion of the transforms. Thus, the real cepstrum can be
computed by calculating the inverse Fourier transform of the log-spectrum of the input.
