where Ti and Te are the temperatures internal and external to the composite structure, respectively, Dx is the
thickness of each material in the direction of heat ï¬‚ow, and the summation sign pertains to p distinct layers
of material. The thermal conductivities of typical packaging materials are tabulated in Table 33.1.
