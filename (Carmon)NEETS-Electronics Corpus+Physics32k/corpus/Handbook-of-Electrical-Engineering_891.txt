Note in Fig. 13.1 that the numbers next to the wires represent the circuit nodes. These numbers are used to
describe  the  circuit  to  the  simulator.  In  most  SPICE-type  simulators  the  nodes  are  represented  by  numbers,
with the ground node being node zero. Referring to Fig. 13.2, the 723 regulator and its internal op amp are
represented by subcircuits. Each subcircuit has its own set of nodes and components. Subcircuits are useful for
encapsulating sections of a circuit or when a certain section needs to be used repeatedly (see next section).
