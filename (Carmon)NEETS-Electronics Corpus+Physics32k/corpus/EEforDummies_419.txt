Sizing up capacitor packaging
Capacitors come in a variety of shapes and sizes (refer to Figure 7‐1). 
Aluminum electrolytic and paper capacitors commonly come in a cylindrical 
shape. Tantalum electrolytic, ceramic, mica, and polystyrene capacitors have 
a more bulbous shape because they typically get dipped into an epoxy or 
plastic bath to form their outside skin. However, not all capacitors of any par-
ticular type (such as mica or Mylar) get manufactured the same way, so you 
can’t always tell the component by its cover.
