An Example Finding z Parameters and Network Characteristics
To solve for two-port network characteristics we can ﬁrst represent the network with its two-port parameters
and then use these parameters to ﬁnd the characteristics summarized in Table 3.1. To ﬁnd the parameters, we
terminate the network adhering to the deﬁnition of the parameter we are evaluating. Then, we can use mesh
or nodal analysis, current or voltage division, or equivalent impedance to solve for the parameters. The following
example demonstates the technique.
