For this reason a series circuit is often called a voltage divider for its ability to proportion
– or divide – the total voltage into fractional portions of constant ratio. With a little bit of
algebra, we can derive a formula for determining series resistor voltage drop given nothing
more than total voltage, individual resistance, and total resistance:
