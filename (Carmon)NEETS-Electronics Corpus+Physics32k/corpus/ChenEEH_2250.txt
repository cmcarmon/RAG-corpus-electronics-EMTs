For two-dimensional structures (i.e., structures that are
inÔ¨Ånitely long along the z-axis), the same method is employed
except the charge used in the expression is the charge per unit
length, and the resulting capacitance is a capacitance per unit
length in Farads per meter (which coincidentally is the same as
the units of the permittivity.) Thus, for coaxial cylindrical
shells of inner radius a and outer radius b, the result is:
