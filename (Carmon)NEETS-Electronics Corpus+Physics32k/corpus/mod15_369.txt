If you continue to turn the gyro case at this rate, the precession of the gyro will continually exert a 
pull on the spring. More precisely, the gyro will precess until the 1 pound pull of the crossarm is exactly 
counterbalanced by the tension of the spring; it will remain in a fixed position, as shown in figure 3-15. 
That is, it will remain in the precessed position as long as you continue to rotate the gyro case at the same, 
constant speed. A pointer attached to the output axis could be used with a calibrated scale to measure 
precise angular rates.
