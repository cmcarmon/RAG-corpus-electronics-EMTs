Permeability – The speciﬁc measure of a material’s acceptance of magnetic ﬂux, analogous
to the speciﬁc resistance of a conductive material (ρ), except inverse (greater permeability
means easier passage of magnetic ﬂux, whereas greater speciﬁc resistance means more difﬁcult
passage of electric current).
