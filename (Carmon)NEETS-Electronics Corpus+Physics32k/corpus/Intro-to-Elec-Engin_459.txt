A mechanical feedback arm from the steering linkage causes the valve to return to its neutral
position as the wheels turn, thereby allowing the driver to make a gradual turn. As and when the
steering wheel is turned, the wheels move a proportional amount rather than moving all the way
to the extreme position.
