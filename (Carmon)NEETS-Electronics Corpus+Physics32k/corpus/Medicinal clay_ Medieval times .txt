In medieval Persia, Avicenna (980-1037 CE), the 'Prince of Doctors', wrote about clay therapy in his numerous treatises.
Ibn al-Baitar (1197–1248), a Muslim scholar born at Malaga, Spain, and author of a famous work on pharmacology, discusses eight kinds of medicinal earth. The eight kinds are:
the terra sigillata,
Egyptian earth,
Samian earth,
earth of Chios,
Cimolean earth or pure clay (cimolite), soft earth, called al-hurr, green in color like verdigris, is smoked together with almond bark to serve as food when it will turn red and assume a good flavor; it is but rarely eaten without being smoked—also called 'Argentiera',
earth of vines called ampelitis (Pliny XXXV, 56) or pharmakitis from Seleucia in Syria,
Armenian earth (also known as the Armenian bole), salutary in cases of bubonic plague, being administered both externally and internally,
earth of Nishapur.
