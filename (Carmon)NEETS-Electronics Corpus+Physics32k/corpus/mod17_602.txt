A transceiver is shown in figure 5-15. It is portable, battery powered, and has two channels. It 
provides homing information and two-way voice communications between life rafts and searching ships 
and aircraft. This transceiver is a microminiature, solid-state, hand-held radio that operates on the 
121.5-megahertz and the 243-megahertz guard channels. The transceiver has four operating controls. 
These are the volume (VOL) control, the two-position FREQUENCY SELECTOR, the PUSH-TO-
TALK/ CODE button, and the three-position MODE switch.
