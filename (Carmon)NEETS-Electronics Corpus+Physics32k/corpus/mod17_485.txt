A satellite communications system uses satellites to relay radio transmissions between earth 
terminals. The two types of communications satellites you will study are ACTIVE and PASSIVE. A 
passive satellite only reflects received radio signals back to earth. An active satellite acts as a 
REPEATER; it amplifies signals received and then retransmits them back to earth. This increases signal 
strength at the receiving terminal to a higher level than would be available from a passive satellite.
