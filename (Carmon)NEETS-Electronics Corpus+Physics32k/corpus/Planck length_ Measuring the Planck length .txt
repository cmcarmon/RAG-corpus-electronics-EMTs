It has recently (2017) been suggested by E. Haug that the Planck length can be indirectly measured independent of any knowledge of Newton's gravitational constant with for example the use of a Cavendish apparatus. Further, it seems like the error in the Planck length measures must be exactly half of that in the measurement errors of the Newton's gravitational constant. That is the error as measured in percentage term, also known as the relative standard uncertainty. This is in line with the relative standard uncertainty reported by NIST, which for the gravitational constant is

and for the Planck length is
