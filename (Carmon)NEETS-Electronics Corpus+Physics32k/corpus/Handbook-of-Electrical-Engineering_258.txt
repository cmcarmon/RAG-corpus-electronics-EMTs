The composite signal vc(t) is a mathematical entity; it cannot be seen with an oscilloscope. Its value lies in
the  fact  that  when  a  circuit  is  in  the  steady  state,  its  voltages  and  currents  are  uniquely  determined  by  their
corresponding phasors, and these in turn satisfy Kirchhoff â€™s voltage and current laws! Thus, we are able to write
