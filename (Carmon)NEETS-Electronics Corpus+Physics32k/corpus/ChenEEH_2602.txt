E-plane ﬁlters are usually referred to as ﬁnline and metal
insert ﬁlters that consist of ladder-shaped inserts in the E-plane
of metallic waveguide (Vahldriek, 1989). The inserts can either
be made from pure metal or they consist of a ladder-shaped
metal pattern etched on a thin supporting low-permittivity
substrate. The latter structure is called a quasiplanar ﬁlter.
