3 Uppercase F and V are used throughout to denote real frequencies (in hertz
and radians per second, respectively), while lowercase f and v are used to
represent ‘‘normalized’’ frequencies (dimensionless and in radians, respect-
ively); that is, frequencies normalized to the sample frequency are f ¼ F=Fs
and v ¼ 2p=Fs.
4 The term natural language refers to any of the world’s human languages.
This will be contrasted with a technical meaning of the term formal language
in the material on language modeling in Section 3.4.2 and beyond.
5 The improper use of the term voice to mean speech seems irrevocably
entrenched in the technical lexicon (e.g., voice channel) just as it is in common
use (e.g., a singer with a ‘‘beautiful voice’’).
