The concept of views can serve as a convenient security mechanism. Consider a relation EMPLOYEE that
gives the name of an employee, date of birth, the department worked for, address, phone number, and salary.
A database user who is not allowed to have access to the salary of employees from his own department can
have this portion of the database hidden from him. This can be achieved by limiting his access to a view obtained
from the relation EMPLOYEE by selecting only those tuples where the department attribute is different from his.
Database security can be enhanced by using data encryption. The idea here is to encrypt the data using some
coding technique. An unauthorized user will have difÔ¨Åculty deciphering the encrypted data. Only authorized
users are provided with keys to decipher the encoded data.
