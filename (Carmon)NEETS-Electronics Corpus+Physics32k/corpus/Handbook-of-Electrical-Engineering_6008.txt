As before, the voltage equations of the stator and rotor windings can be written using the coupled circuit
approach. Corresponding voltage equations in the arbitrary qd0 reference frame can be obtained by applying
the  transformation Tqd0(θ)  to  the  stator  variables  and  the  transformation Tqd0(θ  – θ
r)  to  the  rotor  variables.
The equations of a symmetrical induction machine in the arbitrary reference frame in terms of the ﬂux linkages
per second and reactances are summarized in Table 66.5.
