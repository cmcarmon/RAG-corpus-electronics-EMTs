We need an encoding process to translate the discrete sets of
sample value to a more appropriate form of signal. Any plan to
represent each of the discrete sets of value as a particular
arrangement of discrete events is called a code. One of the
discrete events in a code is called a code symbol or symbol. A
particular arrangement of symbols used in a code to represent a
single value of the discrete set is called a codeword or character.
