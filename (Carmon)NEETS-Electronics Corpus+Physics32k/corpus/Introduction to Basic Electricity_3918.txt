transformer coupling is more efficient. The trans-
former is used to match the input and output imped-
ance of the two stages. This keeps the second stage 
from loading down the first stage. loading down is 
the condition when a device creates too large a load 
and severely affects the output by drawing too much 
current. The transformer used to link the two stages 
together is called an interstage transformer.
