The word couple means to connect or to link a signal between two circuits. There 
are generally two types of coupling: DC and AC. As shown in Figure 5.2, DC coupling 
refers  a  direct  wire  connection  between  two  circuits;  while  AC  coupling  refers  to  two 
circuits connected via a capacitor. Between AC coupled circuits, signals at frequencies 
below some cut-off frequency will be progressively attenuated at lower frequencies. The 
cut-off  frequency  is  determined  by  the  coupling  capacitance  along  with  the  output 
impedance  of  the  transmitting  circuit  and  the input impedance of the receiving circuit. 
Oscilloscope inputs also have both AC and DC coupling options, which allow the user 
the  select  between  viewing  the  total  signal  or  just  the  time-varying  component.  In 
addition to describing intentional circuit connections, AC coupling also refers to the path 
of interference signals through stray capacitances in the physical circuit. There are also a 
number of other coupling mechanisms not included in this discussion, such as magnetic, 
optical, and radio-frequency coupling.
