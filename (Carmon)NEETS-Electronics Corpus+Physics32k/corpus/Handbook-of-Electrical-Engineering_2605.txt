If we imagine changing the gate bias from its off condition toward threshold, at ﬁrst the result is to repel majority
carriers, forming a surface depletion layer (refer to Fig. 24.43). In the depletion layer there are almost no carriers
present, but there are dopant ions. In n-type material these dopant ions are positive donor impurities that cannot
move under ﬁelds because they are locked in the silicon lattice, where they have been deliberately introduced to
replace silicon atoms. In p-type material these dopant ions are negative acceptors. Thus, each charge added to the
gate electrode to bring the gate voltage closer to threshold causes an increase in the depletion-layer width sufﬁcient
to balance the gate charge by an equal but opposite charge of dopant ions in the silicon depletion layer.
