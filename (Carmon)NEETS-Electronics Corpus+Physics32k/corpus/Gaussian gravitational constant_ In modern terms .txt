Gauss is notorious for leaving out details, and this derivation is no exception. It is here repeated in modern terms, filling out some of the details.
Define without proof

,


{\displaystyle h=2{\frac {dA}{dt}},}

where
dA/dt is the time rate of sweep of area by a body in its orbit, a constant according to Kepler's second law, and
h is the specific angular momentum, one of the constants of two-body motion.
Next define





h

μ
p
,


{\displaystyle h^{2}=\mu p,}

where
μ = G(M + m), a gravitational parameter, where
G is Newton's gravitational constant,
M is the mass of the primary body (i.e., the Sun),
m is the mass of the secondary body (i.e., a planet), and

p is the semi-parameter (the semi-latus rectum) of the body's orbit.
Note that every variable in the above equations is a constant for two-body motion. Combining these two definitions,

{\displaystyle \left(2{\frac {dA}{dt}}\right)^{2}=G(M+m)p,}

which is what Gauss was describing with the last of his laws. Taking the square root,

{\displaystyle 2{\frac {dA}{dt}}={\sqrt {G}}{\sqrt {M+m}}{\sqrt {p}},}

and solving for √G,

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {G}}={\frac {2dA}{dt{\sqrt {M+m}}{\sqrt {p}}}}.}

At this point, define k ≡ √G. Let dA be the entire area swept out by the body as it orbits, hence dA = πab, the area of an ellipse, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis. Let dt = P, the time for the body to complete one orbit. Thus,




k

p





.


{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi ab}{P{\sqrt {M+m}}{\sqrt {p}}}}.}

Here, Gauss decides to use Earth to solve for k. From the geometry of an ellipse, p = b2/a.   By setting Earth's semi-major axis, a = 1, p reduces to b2 and √p = b. Substituting, the area of the ellipse "is evidently" π√p, rather than πab. Putting this into the numerator of the equation for k and reducing,




k

P


M
+
m





.


{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi }{P{\sqrt {M+m}}}}.}

Note that Gauss, by normalizing the size of the orbit, has eliminated it completely from the equation. Normalizing further, set the mass of the Sun to 1,




k

m





,


{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi }{P{\sqrt {1+m}}}},}

where now m is in solar masses. What is left are two quantities: P, the period of Earth's orbit or the sidereal year, a quantity known precisely by measurement over centuries, and m, the mass of the Earth–Moon system. Again plugging in the measured values as they were known in Gauss's time, P = 365.2563835 days, m = 1/354710 solar masses, yielding the result k = 0.01720209895.
