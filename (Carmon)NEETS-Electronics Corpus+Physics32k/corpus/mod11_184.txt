For the pi mode, all parts of each strapping ring are at the same potential; but the two rings have 
alternately opposing potentials, as shown in figure 2-34. Stray capacitance between the rings adds 
capacitive loading to the resonant mode. For other modes, however, a phase difference exists between the 
successive segments connected to a given strapping ring which causes current to flow in the straps.
