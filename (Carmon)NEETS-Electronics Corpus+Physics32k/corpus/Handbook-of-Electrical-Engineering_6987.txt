If j(t) is a zero mean process, then so is the interpolation noise. Thus, the noisy interpolation is an unbiased
version  of  x(t).  More  remarkably,  if  j(t)  is  a  zero-mean  (wide-sense)  stationary  process  with  uncertainty
(variance) s2, then so is h(t). In other words, the uncertainty at the sample point locations is the same as at all
points of interpolation [Marks, 1991].
