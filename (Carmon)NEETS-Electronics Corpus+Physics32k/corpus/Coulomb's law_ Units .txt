When the electromagnetic theory is expressed using the International System of Units, force is measured in newtons, charge in coulombs, and distance in metres. Coulomb's constant is given by ke = ​1⁄4πε0. The constant ε0 is the permittivity of free space in C2 m−2 N−1. And ε is the relative permittivity of the material in which the charges are immersed, and is dimensionless.
The SI derived units for the electric field are volts per meter, newtons per coulomb, or tesla meters per second.
Coulomb's law and Coulomb's constant can also be interpreted in various terms:
Atomic units. In atomic units the force is expressed in hartrees per Bohr radius, the charge in terms of the elementary charge, and the distances in terms of the Bohr radius.
Electrostatic units or Gaussian units. In electrostatic units and Gaussian units, the unit charge (esu or statcoulomb) is defined in such a way that the Coulomb constant k disappears because it has the value of one and becomes dimensionless.
Cgs units are often preferred in the treatment of electromagnetism, as they greatly simplify formulas.
