c
Thus if we know two of the sides (for example, a
and b) of a right-angled triangle we can easily find 
the third side (c). 
  The  ratios  a/c, b/c, and  a/b are  known  as  the 
basic trigonometric ratios. They are known as sine 
(sin),  cosine  (cos) and  tangent  (tan) of  angle  8
respectively. Thus:
