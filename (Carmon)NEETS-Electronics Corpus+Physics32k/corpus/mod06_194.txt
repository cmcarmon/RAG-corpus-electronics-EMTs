Because the grid is close to the cathode, small changes in grid voltage have large effects on the
conduction of triodes. If a large enough input signal is placed on the grid, a triode may be driven into
either plate-current cutoff or plate-current saturation. When this occurs, the tube is said to be
OVERDRIVEN. Overdriving is considered to be a form of DISTORTION.
