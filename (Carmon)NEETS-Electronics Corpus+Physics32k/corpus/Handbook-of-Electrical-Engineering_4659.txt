The SAW Superposition Impulse Response Transducer Model
The impulse response model was ﬁrst presented by Hartmann et al.
[1973] to describe SAW ﬁlter design and
 
synthesis.  For  a  linear  causal  system,  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  device’s  frequency  response  is  the  device
impulse time response. Hartmann showed that the time response of a SAW transducer is given by
