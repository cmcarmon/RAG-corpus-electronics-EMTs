Voltage tests must be made with the power applied; therefore, the prescribed safety precautions must
be followed to prevent injury to personnel and damage to the equipment. You will find in your
maintenance work that the voltage test is of utmost importance. It is used not only in isolating casualties
to major components but also in the maintenance of subassemblies, units, and circuits. Before checking a
circuit voltage, you should check the voltage of the power source to be sure that the normal voltage is
being applied to the circuit.
