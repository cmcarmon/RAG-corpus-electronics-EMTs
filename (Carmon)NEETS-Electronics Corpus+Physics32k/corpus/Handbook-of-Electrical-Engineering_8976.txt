Voice
Voice  input  is  an  intriguing  approach  to  data  input,  with  particular
attractiveness  to  managers  who  want  a  simple  and  direct  means  for
inputting data and commands. For many years, this technology tended
to promise more than it could achieve, but recent developments have brought it to the point where it can be
considered as a viable input means. This has been due to new developments in software that make it possible
to minimize the amount of training required and increase the success rate to close to 100%.
