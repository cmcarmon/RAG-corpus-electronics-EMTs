Butt-jointed connectors and expanded-beam connectors are the two basic types of fiber optic
connectors. Fiber optic butt-jointed connectors align and bring the prepared ends of two fibers into close
contact. The end-faces of some butt-jointed connectors touch, but others do not depending upon the
connector design. Types of butt-jointed connectors include cylindrical ferrule and biconical connectors.
Fiber optic expanded-beam connectors use two lenses to first expand and then refocus the light from the
transmitting fiber into the receiving fiber. Single fiber butt-jointed and expanded beam connectors
normally consist of two plugs and an adapter (coupling device). Figure 4-15 shows how to configure each
plug and adapter when making the connection between two optical fibers.
