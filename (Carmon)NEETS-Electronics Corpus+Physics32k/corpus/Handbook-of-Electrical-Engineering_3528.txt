Partitioning decomposes the design description into smaller behaviors. Partitioning is an example of a high-
level transformation. High-level transformations include common software programming compiler optimiza-
tions, such as loop unrolling, subprogram in-line expansion, constant propagation, and common subexpression
elimination.
