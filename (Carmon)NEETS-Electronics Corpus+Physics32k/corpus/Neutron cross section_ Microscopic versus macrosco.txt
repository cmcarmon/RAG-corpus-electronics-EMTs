Up to now, the cross section referred to in this article corresponds to the microscopic cross section σ. However, it is possible to define the macroscopic cross section Σ which corresponds to the total "equivalent area" of all target particles per unit volume:




Σ
=
N

σ


{\displaystyle \Sigma =N\,\sigma }

where N is the atomic density of the target.
Therefore, since the cross section can be expressed in cm2 and the density in cm−3, the macroscopic cross section is usually expressed in cm−1. Using the equation derived in #Link to reaction rate and interpretation, the reaction rate per unit volume R can be derived using only the neutron flux Φ and the macroscopic cross section Σ:




R
=
Σ

Φ


{\displaystyle R=\Sigma \,\Phi }
