A limited-slip differential is a type of differential that allows its two output shafts to rotate at different speeds but limits the maximum difference between the two shafts.
In an automobile, such limited-slip differentials are sometimes used in place of a standard differential, where they convey certain dynamic advantages, at the expense of greater complexity.
