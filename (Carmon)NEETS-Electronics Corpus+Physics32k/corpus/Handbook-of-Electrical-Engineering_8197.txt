7. Gas discharges switch in microseconds and so plasma displays can be updated instantly. Speed is especially
important for the very popular mouse and cursor operations where the cursor would disappear when
moving on a liquid crystal display. Full motion television images are not a challenge for plasma displays.
8. The luminance and luminous efﬁciency of color plasma displays are good. Displays having 450 candelas
per meter squared at 1 lumen per watt have been demonstrated. Some other display technologies such
as  ac  electroluminescence  have  a  higher  material  luminous  efﬁciency  but  this  performance  must  be
tempered  by  the  fact  that  the  plasma  panel  has  1000  times  less  electrical  capacitance  than  the  ac
electroluminescent devices. The plasma panel frequently takes less power than the EL devices when the
switching loss of the EL panel is considered. This favors plasma panels for larger numbers of scanned
lines and favors EL panels for smaller numbers of scanned lines. The crossover point is somewhere in
the region of a few hundred scanned lines.
