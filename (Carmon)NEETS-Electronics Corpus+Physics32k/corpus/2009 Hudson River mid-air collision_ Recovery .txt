On the afternoon of the crash, divers had recovered two bodies from the water. By the next morning, a total of four bodies had been found, while the other five victims were presumed dead. Meanwhile, the helicopter's wreckage was found in about 30 feet (9 m) of water, far from the wreckage fields of the plane. Aided by a sonar, investigators attempted to discover the plane's debris in deeper water near the mid-channel point of the Hudson. Their efforts were hindered, however, by poor visibility underwater and a storm on August 9.
The efforts succeeded on August 10, when the plane's wreckage was discovered in approximately 60 ft (18 m) of water, and was recovered from the river on the afternoon of August 11. Additionally, the last few bodies were found in the wreckage of the plane, ending the search for bodies. The recovery effort was led by the United States Army Corps of Engineers with the aid of NYPD boats, New Jersey State Police divers, and the FDNY.
