Like the slot antenna, the tapered slot antenna (TSA) is etched
on a grounded dielectric slab. A TSA with a CPW feed via a
CPW slot line transition is shown in Figure 11.19. This par-
ticular TSA with its exponential taper is known as a Vivaldi
antenna. Other conﬁgurations of different taper proﬁles are
also commonly used, including the linear taper (LTSA) and the
constant width (CWSA). These antennas are completely
planar, have an end-ﬁre pattern, and can obtain high directiv-
ity and/or bandwidth. Proposed applications include milli-
meter-wave imaging, power combining, and use as an active
integrated antenna element.
