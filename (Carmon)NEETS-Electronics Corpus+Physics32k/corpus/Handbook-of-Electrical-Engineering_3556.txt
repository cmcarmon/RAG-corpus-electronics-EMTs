Emulation offers the advantage of providing prototype hardware early in the design cycle to check for errors
or inconsistencies in initial functional speciﬁcations. Problems can be isolated and design modiﬁcations can
be easily accommodated by reprogramming the logic devices. Emulation can support functional veriﬁcation
at  computational  rates  much  greater  than  conventional  simulation.  However,  emulation  does  not  generally
support performance veriﬁcation because, as explained above, prototype hardware typically does not operate
at production clock rates.
