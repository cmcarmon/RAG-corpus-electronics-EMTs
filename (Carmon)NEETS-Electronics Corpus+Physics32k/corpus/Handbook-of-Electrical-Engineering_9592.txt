Associative Processor
Associative memories, also known as content-addressable memories, retrieve information on the basis of data
content rather than addresses. An associative memory performs comparison (i.e., exclusive-OR or equivalence)
operations at its bit level. The results of the comparison on a group of bits in a word for all words in the memory
are transmitted to a register called a response register or ﬂag. In addition, there are circuits such as multiple
match resolver, enable/disable register, a number of temporary registers, as well as appropriate logic gates for
arithmetic capabilities are
resolving multiple responses and information retrieval. For 
added to this unit. The unit can be viewed as consisting of a number of bit-serial PEs. Furthermore, the bit-
level  logic  is  moved  out  of  the  memory  so  that  the  memory  part  of  the  processor  consists  of  a  number  of
random-access memories called word modules. A typical associative processor is shown in Fig. 95.5. STARAN
and  MPP  (Fig.  95.2)  are  representative  of  this  bit-serial,  word-parallel  SIMD  organization.  In  Fig.  95.5  the
common register is where the common operand is stored and the mask register deﬁnes the bit positions requiring
operation. The enable/disable register provides local control of individual PEs. Because of its simplicity in design
the per-PE cost of an associative processor is much lower, but the bit-serial operations slow down the system
drastically. To compensate for this, these systems are useful only for applications requiring a large number of PEs.
