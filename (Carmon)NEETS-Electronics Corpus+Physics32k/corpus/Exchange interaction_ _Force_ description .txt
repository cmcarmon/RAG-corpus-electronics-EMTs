The exchange interaction is sometimes called the exchange force. However, it is not a true force and should not be confused with the exchange forces produced by the exchange of force carriers, such as the electromagnetic force produced between two electrons by the exchange of a photon, or the strong force between two quarks produced by the exchange of a gluon.
Although sometimes erroneously described as a force, the exchange interaction is a purely quantum mechanical effect unlike other forces.
