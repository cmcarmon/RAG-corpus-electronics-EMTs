Many and varied kinds of modulation have been used in telemetry systems. All have general usefulness, with
cost and application being the drivers. Synchronized modulation is generally used with other systems, being
synchronized to them to give additional information such as range. Typically, a command control uplink to
an aircraft is used to synchronize a telemetry downlink with the delay being proportional to distance or the
length of the link. Signal-to-noise advantages are also achieved. Another example is one in which telemetry is
tacked on to a radar transponder to add additional pulses to indicate altitude, heading identiÔ¨Åcation, or other
conditions of the vehicle carrying the transponder. This is usually accomplished with pulse position modulation.
In many instances, a reconnaissance vehicle will carry a television camera. Its signals may be recorded on
board but are often telemetered for real-time observations. Data may be placed on the same carrier using a few
lines  of  the  TV  picture  or  an  additional  subcarrier.  The  much  greater  bandwidth  of  the  TV  signal  seriously
compromises  the  combination  of  range,  transmitter  power,  and  antenna  directivity,  and  typically  signal-to-
noise ratio is reduced as much as 30 dB.
