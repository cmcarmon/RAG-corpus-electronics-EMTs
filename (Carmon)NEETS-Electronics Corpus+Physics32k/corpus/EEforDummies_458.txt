Connect the changeover switch to the charge position by placing the 
free end of the jumper wire into a hole in the same row as the uncon-
nected side of R1. Observe the voltage reading on your meter. You 
should see the meter reading rise to approximately 9Â V as the capaci-
tor charges through resistor R1. It should take about 5 seconds for the 
capacitor to charge completely.
