Note that in delaying the signal how we carefully included the unit step. The second term in this
result does not begin until t = ∆. Thus, the waveforms shown in the Filtering Periodic Signals
example (Figure 4.10) mentioned above are exponentials. We say that the time constant of an
exponentially decaying signal equals the time it takes to decrease by 1/e of its original value. Thus,
the time-constant of the rising and falling portions of the output equal the product of the circuit’s
resistance and capacitance.
Exercise 4.16
(Solution on p. 140.)
Derive the ﬁlter’s output by considering the terms in (4.41) in the order given. Integrate last rather
than ﬁrst. You should get the same answer.
