where dl is the deﬂection length, q the drop charge, m the drop mass, E the electric ﬁeld, v the drop velocity,
lp the deﬂection plate length, and lz the distance from the upstream end of the deﬂection plates to the paper.
Drop deﬂection can be either binary or analog. With the former, the drop either reaches the paper or is directed
into a collection gutter. With analog deﬂection, the drop may be deﬂected linear (e.g., any position over the
height of a printed character).
