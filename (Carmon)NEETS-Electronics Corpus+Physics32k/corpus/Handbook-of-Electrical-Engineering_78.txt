Dissipation Factor (DF)
The dissipation factor in percentage is the ratio of the effective series resistance of a capacitor to its reactance
at  a  speciÔ¨Åed  frequency.  It  is  the  reciprocal  of quality  factor  (Q)  and  an  indication  of  power  loss  within  the
capacitor. It should be as low as possible.
