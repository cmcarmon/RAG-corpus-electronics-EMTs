An isometric action of a group



G


{\displaystyle G}
on the hyperbolic plane





H


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}}
is called geometric if this action is properly discontinuous and cocompact. Every geometric action of



G


{\displaystyle G}
on





H


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}}
induces a uniform convergence action of



G


{\displaystyle G}
on





S

=
∂

H

≈
∂
G


{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{1}=\partial H^{2}\approx \partial G}
. An important result of Tukia (1986), Gabai (1992), Casson–Jungreis (1994), and Freden (1995) shows that the converse also holds:
Theorem. If



G


{\displaystyle G}
is a group acting as a discrete uniform convergence group on





S


1




{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{1}}
then this action is topologically conjugate to an action induced by a geometric action of



G


{\displaystyle G}
on





H


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}}
by isometries.
Note that whenever



G


{\displaystyle G}
acts geometrically on





H


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{2}}
, the group



G


{\displaystyle G}
is virtually a hyperbolic surface group, that is,



G


{\displaystyle G}
contains a finite index subgroup isomorphic to the fundamental group of a closed hyperbolic surface.
