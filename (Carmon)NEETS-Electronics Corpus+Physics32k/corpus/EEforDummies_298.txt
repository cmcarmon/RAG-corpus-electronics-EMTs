There are certain “rules” for combining resistances, which I cover in this 
section. Use these rules not only to help you choose off‐the‐shelf resistors 
for your own circuits, but also as a key part of your effort to analyze other 
people’s electronic circuits. For instance, if you know that a light bulb has a 
certain amount of resistance, and you place a resistor in series with the bulb 
to limit the current, you’ll need to know what the total resistance of the two 
components is before you can calculate the current passing through them.
