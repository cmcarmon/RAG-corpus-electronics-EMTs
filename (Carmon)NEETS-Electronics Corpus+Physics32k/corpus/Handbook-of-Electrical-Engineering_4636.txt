Most transducers are displacement limited, so for a direct-radiating transducer V in Eq. (46.18) is limited. To
obtain the most output power the piston should have the largest possible surface area consistent with keeping
the transducer omnidirectional (the transducer will become directional when a ‡ l). This is easy to do in air
but difﬁcult in water since it is hard to make pistons which are both lightweight and stiff enough to hold their
shape in water. Alternatively, the driver can be placed at the apex of a horn. For a conical horn, the ﬂuid velocity
at the end of the horn (where the radius is ae) will be reduced to V(a/ae) but the radiating piston will now have
an effective radius of ae so the radiated power will increase by a factor of (ae/a)2. For high-power operation at
a single frequency, the driver can be placed at the end of a quarter wave resonator.
