There are three different composition types for an asteroid or comet: metallic, stony, and icy. The composition of the object determines whether or not it will make it to the Earth's surface in one piece, disintegrate before breaching the atmosphere, or break up and explode just before reaching the surface. A metallic object tends to be made up of iron and nickel alloys. These metallic objects are the most likely to impact the surface because they stand up better to the stresses of ram pressure induced flattening and fragmentation during deceleration in the atmosphere. The stony objects, like chondritic meteorites, tend to burn, break up, or explode before leaving the upper atmosphere. Those that do make it to the surface need a minimum energy of about 10 MT or about 50 m (160 ft) diameter to breach the lower atmosphere (this is for a stony object hitting at 20 km/s). The porous comet-like objects are made up of low-density silicates, organics, ice, and volatile, and often burn up in the upper atmosphere because of their low bulk density (â‰¤1 g/cm3).
