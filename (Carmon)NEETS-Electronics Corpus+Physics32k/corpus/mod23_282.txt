Figure 6-5 shows a typical test equipment setup for measuring harmonic distortion. With this setup,
the test signal from the signal generator is recorded and reproduced by the magnetic tape recorder at a
normal record level. The amount of harmonic distortion is measured at the recorderâ€™s output on the wave
analyzer.
