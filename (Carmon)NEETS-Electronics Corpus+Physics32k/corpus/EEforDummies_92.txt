Using alternating current from a power plant
When you plug a light into an electrical outlet in your home, you’re using 
electrical energy that originated at a generating plant. Generating plants pro-
cess natural resources — such as water, coal, oil, natural gas, or uranium — 
through several steps to produce electrical energy. Electrical energy is said 
to be a secondary energy source because it’s generated through the conver-
sion of a primary energy source.
