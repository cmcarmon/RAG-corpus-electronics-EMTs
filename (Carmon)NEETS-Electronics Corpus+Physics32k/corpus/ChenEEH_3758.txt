ated with the respective clusters. Only the centroids are kept,
and collectively they are called a codebook for the vector
quantizer. Subsequently, any observation vector used for either
training or recognition is quantized (assigned to the nearest
code) using this codebook; hence, each feature vector suffers
some degree of quantization in the feature space. If there are K
possible vectors (observations) in the codebook, then it is
sufÔ¨Åcient to assign to an observation a single integer, say k,
where 1  k  K . Formally, the vector random process y is
replaced by a scalar random process, say y, where each of the
random variables y
