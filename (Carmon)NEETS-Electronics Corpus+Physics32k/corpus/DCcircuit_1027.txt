semiconductor (ampliﬁer) circuits, where sometimes AC is often mixed (superimposed) with
DC. Because AC voltage and current equations (Ohm’s Law) are linear just like DC, we can
use Superposition to analyze the circuit with just the DC power source, then just the AC power
source, combining the results to tell what will happen with both AC and DC sources in ef-
fect. For now, though, Superposition will sufﬁce as a break from having to do simultaneous
equations to analyze a circuit.
