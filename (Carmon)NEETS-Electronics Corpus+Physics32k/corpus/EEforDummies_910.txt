A typical small breadboard has 400 contact holes, and itâ€™s useful for building 
smaller circuits with no more than two ICs (plus other discrete components). 
A typical larger breadboard contains 830 contacts, and you can use it to build 
somewhat more complex circuits. You can also link multiple breadboards 
simply by connecting one or more wires between contact holes on one board 
and contact holes on the other board.
