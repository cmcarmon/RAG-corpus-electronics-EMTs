Referring to Figure 36-41, select the amount of cur-
rent that is desired to flow through resistor R2 starts the 
process. In this example, an arbitrary value of 10Â mA 
is chosen. This means that there is 10 mA of current 
flowing through R2 and the voltage at Junction A 
is 6 volts. Therefore R2 can be determined as follows:
