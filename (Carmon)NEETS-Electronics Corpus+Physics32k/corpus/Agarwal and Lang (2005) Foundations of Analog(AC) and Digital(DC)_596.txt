Referring to the
series-connected diodes in Figure 4.18, determine v1, v2, v3, and v4, given that I = 2 A.
The parameters in the diode relation are given to be Is = 10
We will first use the node method to solve this problem. Figure 4.18 shows the ground
node and the node voltages. There are four unknown node voltages. Next, we write
KCL for each of the nodes. As prescribed by the node method, we will use KVL and the
diode relation (Equation 4.1) to obtain the currents directly in terms of the node voltage
differences and element parameters. For the node with voltage v1,
−12(e (v2−v1)/0.025 − 1).
