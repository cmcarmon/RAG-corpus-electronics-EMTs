In an X-ray tube, electrons are accelerated in a vacuum by an electric field towards a piece of metal called the "target." X-rays are emitted as the electrons slow down (decelerate) in the metal. The output spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum of X-rays, with additional sharp peaks at certain energies (see graph on right). The continuous spectrum is due to bremsstrahlung, while the sharp peaks are characteristic X-rays associated with the atoms in the target. For this reason, bremsstrahlung in this context is also called continuous X-rays.
The shape of this continuum spectrum is approximately described by Kramers' law.
The formula for Kramers' law is usually given as the distribution of intensity (photon count)

{\displaystyle I(\lambda )d\lambda =K\left({\frac {\lambda }{\lambda _{min}}}-1\right){\frac {1}{\lambda ^{2}}}d\lambda }

The constant K is proportional to the atomic number of the target element, and

is the minimum wavelength given by the Duane–Hunt law.
The spectrum has a sharp cutoff at

{\displaystyle \lambda _{min}}
, which is due to the limited energy of the incoming electrons. For example, if an electron in the tube is accelerated through 60 kV, then it will acquire a kinetic energy of 60 keV, and when it strikes the target it can create X-rays with energy of at most 60 keV, by conservation of energy. (This upper limit corresponds to the electron coming to a stop by emitting just one X-ray photon. Usually the electron emits many photons, and each has an energy less than 60 keV.) A photon with energy of at most 60 keV has wavelength of at least 21 pm, so the continuous X-ray spectrum has exactly that cutoff, as seen in the graph. More generally the formula for the low-wavelength cutoff, the Duane-Hunt law, is:

where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, V is the voltage that the electrons are accelerated through, e is the elementary charge, and pm is picometres.
