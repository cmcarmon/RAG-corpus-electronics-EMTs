The interaction between the conductor field and the main field of the generator weakens the field 
above the conductor and strengthens the field below the conductor. The main field consists of lines that 
now act like stretched rubber bands. Thus, an upward reaction force is produced that acts in opposition to 
the downward driving force applied to the armature conductor. If the current in the conductor increases, 
the reaction force increases. Therefore, more force must be applied to the conductor to keep it moving.
