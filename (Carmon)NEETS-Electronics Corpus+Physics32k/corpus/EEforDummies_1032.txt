You can use a multimeter to check whether two points within a row — or 
between rows — are electrically connected. Stick a jumper wire in each hole, 
and then touch one multimeter probe to one wire and the other probe to the 
other wire. If you get a low ohm reading, the two points are connected. If you 
get an infinite ohm reading, they aren’t connected. (See Chapter 16 for more 
about testing things with your multimeter.)
