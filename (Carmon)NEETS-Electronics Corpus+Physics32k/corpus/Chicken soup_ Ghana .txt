In Ghana, chicken soup is often seasoned with lemon juice or vinegar. Very often people add a mixture of yogurt and egg towards the end of the cooking process to make the soup denser and creamier. One egg and 100â€“150mL of yogurt are combined in a deep cup and mixed until smooth. This gets stirred slowly into the soup after the pot is removed from heat to prevent curdling. Finely fresh chopped parsley is often added before serving.
