The International System of units (SI) was adopted by the 11th General Conference on Weights and Measures
  one  for  each  of  the  seven
(CGPM)  in  1960.  It  is  a  coherent  system  of  units  built  form  seven 
dimensionally  independent  base  quantities:  they  are  the  meter,  kilogram,  second,  ampere,  kelvin,  mole,  and
candela,  for  the  dimensions  length,  mass,  time,  electric  current,  thermodynamic  temperature,  amount  of
SI
substance,  and  luminous  intensity,  respectively.  The  deÔ¨Ånitions  of  the  SI  base  units  are  given  below.  The 
 are expressed as products of powers of the base units, analogous to the corresponding relations
derived units
between physical quantities but with numerical factors equal to unity.
