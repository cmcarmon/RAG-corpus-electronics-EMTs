Although strikes can happen at any time of day, deer tend to move at dawn and dusk, and are particularly active during the October–December mating season, and also during late March and early April, in the Northern Hemisphere. Driving at night presents its own challenges: nocturnal species are active, and visibility, particularly side visibility, is reduced. Penguins, for example, are common roadkill victims in Wellington, New Zealand, due to their skin color and the fact that they come ashore at dusk and leave again around dawn, making it hard for drivers to see them.
Night time drivers should reduce speed and use high beam headlights when possible, to give themselves maximum time to avoid a collision. However, when headlights approach a nocturnal animal, it is hard for the creature to see the approaching car (nocturnal animals see better in low than in bright light). Furthermore, the glare of oncoming vehicle headlights can dazzle some species, such as rabbits; they will freeze in the road rather than flee. It may be better to flash the headlights on and off, rather than leaving them on continuously while approaching an animal.
The simple tactics of reducing speed and scanning both sides of the road for foraging deer can improve driver safety at night, and drivers may see the retro-reflection of an animal’s eyes before seeing the animal itself.
