In the cycle, an ideal gas undergoes
1-2: Constant volume (isochoric) heat addition;
2-3: Isentropic expansion;
3-1: Constant pressure (isobaric) heat rejection.
The expansion process is isentropic and hence involves no heat interaction. Energy is absorbed as heat during the isochoric heating and rejected as work during the isentropic expansion. Waste heat is rejected during the isobaric cooling which consumes some work.
