Magnetoelastic Anisotropy
Spin-orbit coupling is also responsible for magnetostriction (the increase or decrease of the dimensions of a
body on becoming magnetized or demagnetized). The magnetostriction coefﬁcient ls = fractional change of a
dimension of the body. It can be positive or negative, and it varies with changes in the direction and magnitude
of the applied stress (or internal stress) and of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. It is highly sensitive to composition,
to structure, and to the previous history of the sample. The maximum coercivity is given by the formula Hc =
3lsT/Ms where l s is the saturation magnetostriction coefﬁcient, T is the tension, and Ms the saturation mag-
netization. Magnetostriction has been put to practical use in the generation of sonar waves for the detection
of schools of ﬁsh or submarines.
