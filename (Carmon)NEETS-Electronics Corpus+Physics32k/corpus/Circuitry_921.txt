29. A  transformer  has  400  primary  turns  and  60 
secondary turns. The primary is connected to a 
220  V  a.c.  supply  and 
is 
load  resistance  of  20  G.
connected 
Assuming 
the 
is  perfect, 
determine:  (a)  the  secondary  voltage;  (b)  the 
secondary  current;  and  (c)  the  primary  current.
