Computer-Aided Design for Microstrip Antennas
Ideally, antenna CAD software would combine a user-friendly interface with a computationally efﬁcient set of
accurate and versatile theoretical models. While software with such features has reached a fairly high level of
reﬁnement for the analysis of low-frequency and microwave circuit analysis and optimization, the development
of microstrip antenna CAD software lags far behind. One reason is the economic reality that the market for
antenna  software  is  relatively  small,  which  perhaps  explains  why  there  is  very  little  commercially  available
antenna CAD software of any type. Microstrip antenna CAD software development has also been slow because
of  the  fact  that  such  antennas  are  relatively  new,  receiving  serious  attention  only  during  the  last  15  years.
Furthermore, microstrip antenna geometries are relatively difﬁcult to model because of the presence of dielectric
inhomogeneities and a wide variety of feeding techniques and other geometric features. This last consideration
makes the development of a general-purpose microstrip antenna analysis package extremely difﬁcult.
