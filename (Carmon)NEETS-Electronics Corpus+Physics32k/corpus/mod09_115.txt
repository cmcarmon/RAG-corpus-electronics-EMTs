There is little difference between the circuit pulsed by the battery in figure 1-8 that oscillated at its 
resonant (or natural) frequency, and the circuit we have just discussed. The equal and opposite currents in 
the two components are the same as the currents that charged and discharged the capacitor through the 
coil.
