Ion-Selective Electrode (ISE)
As the name implies, ISEs are used to measure the concentration of a speciﬁc ion concentration in a solution
of many ions. To accomplish this, a membrane which selectively generates a potential which is dependent on
the  concentration  of  the  ion  of  interest  is  used.  The  generated  potential  is  usually  an  equilibrium  potential,
called the Nernst potential, and develops across the interface of the membrane with the solution. This potential
is generated by the initial net ﬂow of ions (charge) across the membrane in response to a concentration gradient,
and  from  thence  forth  the  diffusional  force  is  balanced  by  the  generated  electric  force  and  equilibrium  is

membrane acts in such a way as to ensure that the generated potential is dependent mostly on the ion of interest
and negligibly on any other ions in solution. This is done by enhancing the exchange rate of the ion of interest
across the membrane, so it is the fastest moving and, therefore, the species which generates and maintains the
potential.
