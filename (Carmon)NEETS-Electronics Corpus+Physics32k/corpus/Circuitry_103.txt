Energy storage 
 
The energy stored in a capacitor is proportional to 
the product of the capacitance and the square of the 
potential difference. Thus: 
 
W = ½ C V2
where  W is  the  energy  (in  Joules),  C is  the 
capacitance  (in  Farads),  and  V is  the  potential 
difference (in Volts). 
 
Example 2.20 
 
A capacitor  of  47  µF  is  required  to  store  4J  of 
energy.  Determine  the  potential  difference  that 
must be applied to the capacitor. 
 
Solution 
 
The foregoing formula can be re-arranged to make 
V the subject as follows:
