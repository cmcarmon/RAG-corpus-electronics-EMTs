connected in parallel, the current in the auxiliary winding
leads the current in the main winding and produces a traveling
wave. Once the motor comes up to speed, the auxiliary
winding is switched out (Figure 4.28). Figure 4.29 shows the
phasor diagram and torque speed curve. With both windings
connected, the torqueâ€“slip characteristic follows path 1. When
the auxiliary winding is disconnected, the characteristic moves
via path 2 to the main winding curve and then along paths 3
and 4.
