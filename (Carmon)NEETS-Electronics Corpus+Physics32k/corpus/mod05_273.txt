MAGNETIC INDUCTION is the process of inducing an emf in a coil whenever the coil is placed
in a magnetic field and motion exists between the coil and the magnetic lines of flux. This is true if either
the coil or the magnetic field moves, as long as the coil is caused to cut across magnetic flux lines.
