In some situations there is a speciﬁc region of the object where smaller FDTD cells are needed, for example,
a region of high dielectric material, or of ﬁne geometry features such as eyes. But if uniform FDTD cells are
used  throughout  the  computation,  then  these  small  cells  must  be  used  even  in  regions  where  they  are  not
needed. One approach to reduce the total number of FDTD cells for these situations is to mesh local regions
with smaller cells than in the main mesh [Kim and Hoefer, 1990; Zivanovic et al., 1991]. All of the commercial
FDTD software referenced above has this local grid capability.
