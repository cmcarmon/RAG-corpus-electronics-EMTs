In the examples shown for negative logic, you notice that the voltage for the logic 1 state is more
negative with respect to the logic 0 state voltage. This holds true in example 1 where both voltages are
positive. In this case, it may be easier for you to think of the TRUE condition as being less positive than
the FALSE condition. Either way, the end result is negative logic.
