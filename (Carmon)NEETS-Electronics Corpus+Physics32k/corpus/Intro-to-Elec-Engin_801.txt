The integrated-injection logic (IIL or I2L) is a compact, low-power bipolar technology
competitive with MOS technology for LSI. This technology offers packing densities ten times
larger than TTL: 100 to 200 gates per square millimeter as compared with probably 10 to 20 for
TTL. Power consumption and delay time have a kind of trade-off relationship in IIL technology.
