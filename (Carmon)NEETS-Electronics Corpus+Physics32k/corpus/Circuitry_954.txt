We  can  rearrange  the  equation  to  make  Ix the 
subject by adding Ix to both sides: 
 
0 + Ix = –Ix + Ix+ I1 –I2 –I3
From which: 
 
Ix = I1 –I2 –I3
Now I1 = 0.1 A, I2 = 0.25 A and I3 = 0.3 A 
 
Thus: 
 
Ix = 0.1 – 0.25 – 0.3 =  –0.45 A 
Hence Ix = 0.45 A flowing towards the junction 
It  is  important  to  note  here  that  our  original 
‘guess’  as  to  the  direction  of  Ix as  marked  on  Fig. 
A8.3  was  incorrect  and  the  current  is  actually 
flowing the other way! 
  Note  that  it  is  always  a  good  idea  to  check  the 
solution to an equation by substituting the solution 
back  into  the  original  equation.  The  equation 
should  then  balance  such  that  the  left  hand  side 
(LHS) can be shown to be equal to the right hand 
side (RHS). 
 
In  many  cases  it  can  be  more  convenient  to 
change  the  subject  of  a  formula  before  you  insert 
values.  The  next  few  examples  show  how  this  is 
done:
