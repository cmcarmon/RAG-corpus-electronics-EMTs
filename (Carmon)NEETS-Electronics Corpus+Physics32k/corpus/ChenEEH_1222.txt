Expressions for cross talk amplitude and pulse width in re-
sistive, coactively coupled lines should hold for nets with arbi-
trary number of pins and topology under any speciÔ¨Åed input
excitation as explained by Vittal and Marek-Sadowska (1999).
These authors claim that the magnitude of inductive coupling is
small in the presence of good ground return paths close to signal
lines. They used their expression in formulations aimed at
reducing cross talk. These methods included transistor sizing,
wire ordering, wire width optimization, and wire spacing. They
failed to get success in some of these formulations. For wire
ordering, Vittal and Marek-Sadowska (1997) proposed a new
heuristic since they did not report results for this work.
