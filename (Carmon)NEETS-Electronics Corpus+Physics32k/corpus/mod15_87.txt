In this figure, both stationary and rotating coils are connected to the same 60-Hz source. During the 
positive alternation (view A), the polarities are as shown and the top of the rotor is attracted to the bottom 
of the stationary coil. During the negative alternation (view B), the polarities of both coils reverse, thus 
keeping the rotor aligned in the same position. In summary, since both magnetic fields change direction at 
the same time when following the 60-Hz ac supply voltage, the electromagnetic rotor does not change 
position because it is always aligned with the stationary magnetic field.
