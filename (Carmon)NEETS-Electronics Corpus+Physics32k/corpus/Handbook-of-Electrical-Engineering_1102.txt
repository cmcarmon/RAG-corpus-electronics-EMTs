Fast Fourier Transform
One of the approaches to speed the computation of the DFT of a sequence is the decimation-in-time method.
This approach is one of breaking the N-point transform into two (N/2)-point transforms, breaking each (N/2)-
point transform into two (N/4)-point transforms, and continuing the above process until we obtain the two-
point transform. We start with the DFT expression and factor it into two DFTs of length N/2:
