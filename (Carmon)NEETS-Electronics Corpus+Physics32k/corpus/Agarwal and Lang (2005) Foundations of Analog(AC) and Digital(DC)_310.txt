A voltage divider is an isolated loop that contains two or more resistors and a
voltage source in series. A physical voltage divider circuit is illustrated pictorially
in Figure 2.30a. We have connected two resistors in series, and connected the
pair by some wires to a battery. Such a circuit is useful if we wish to obtain some
arbitrary fraction, say 10%, of the battery voltage at the terminals marked v2.
To find the relation between v2 and the battery voltage and resistor values, we
draw the circuit in schematic form, as shown in Figure 2.30b. We then follow
the basic four-step method outlined in Section 2.3 to solve the circuit.
