MOS-Controlled Thyristor (MCT)
The MCT is a new type of power semiconductor device that combines the capabilities of thyristor voltage and
current with MOS gated turn-on and turn-off. It is a high power, high frequency, low conduction drop and a
rugged device, which is more likely to be used in the future for medium and high power applications. A cross
sectional structure of a p-type MCT with its circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 30.7. The MCT has a thyristor
type structure with three junctions and PNPN layers between the anode and cathode. In a practical MCT, about
100,000 cells similar to the one shown are paralleled to achieve the desired current rating. MCT is turned on
by a negative voltage pulse at the gate with respect to the anode, and is turned off by a positive voltage pulse.
The MCT was announced by the General Electric R & D Center on November 30, 1988. Harris Semiconductor
Corporation has developed two generations of p-MCTs. Gen-1 p-MCTs are available at 65 A/1000 V and 75A/600
V with peak controllable current of 120 A. Gen-2 p-MCTs are being developed at similar current and voltage
ratings, with much improved turn-on capability and switching speed. The reason for developing p-MCT is the
fact that the current density that can be turned off is 2 or 3 times higher than that of an n-MCT; but n-MCTs
are the ones needed for many practical applications. Harris Semiconductor Corporation is in the process of
developing n-MCTs, which are expected to be commercially available during the next one to two years.
