The Emergence of Software Quality as a Litigation Issue
On the topic of software litigation, another major change since the previous edition of this handbook is the
increase in lawsuits and litigation involving allegations of poor quality. From observations on half a dozen such
lawsuits, Table 90.3 shows the sequence of defect removal operations that are common when clients sue vendors
for poor quality. It is an interesting observation that for outsource, military, and systems software that ends up
in court for litigation which involves assertions of unacceptable or inadequate quality, the number of testing
stages is much smaller, while formal design and code inspections were not utilized at all. Table 90.3 shows the
typical patterns of defect removal activities for software projects larger than 1000 function points in size where
the  client  sued  the  developing  organization  for  producing  software  with  inadequate  quality  levels.  The  table
simply compares the pattern of defect removal operations observed for reliable software packages with high
quality levels to the pattern noted during lawsuits where poor quality and low reliability was part of the litigation.
It  is  interesting  and  ironic  that  the “reliable”  projects  actually  had  shorter  development  schedules  than  the
projects that ended up in court with charges of poor quality. The reason for this is because ﬁnding and ﬁxing
software  bugs  late  in  the  development  cycle  is  the  major  cause  for  slipping  delivery  dates.  High  quality  and
short schedules usually are closely coupled, although few software project managers know this.
