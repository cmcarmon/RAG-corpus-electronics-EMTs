individual  transistors.  Semiconductor  devices  are 
also  used  to  provide  the  read/write  and  read-only 
memory.  Strictly  speaking,  both  types  of  memory 
permit ‘random access’ since any item of data can 
be retrieved with equal ease regardless of its actual 
location within the memory. Despite this, the term 
‘RAM’ 
synonymous  with 
semiconductor read/write memory. 
  The  basic  components  of  the  system  (CPU, 
RAM,  ROM  and  I/O)  are  linked  together  using  a 
multiple-wire  connecting  system  know  as  a  bus 
(see  Fig.  11.1).  Three  different  buses  are  present, 
these are: 
 
(a) 
 
 
 
(c)  the  control  bus  which  provides  timing  and
