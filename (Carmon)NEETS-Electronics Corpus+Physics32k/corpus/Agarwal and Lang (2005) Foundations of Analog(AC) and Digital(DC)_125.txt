Assuming that the battery terminal voltage is constant at V, because the
power delivered by the battery is the product of the voltage and the current,
an equivalent indication of the power delivered is the amount of current being
supplied. Similarly, the product of current and the length of time the bat-
tery will sustain that current is an indication of the energy capacity of the
battery. A car battery, for instance, might be rated at 12 V and 50 A-hours.
This means that the battery can provide a 1-A current for 50 hours, or a 100-A
current for 30 minutes. The amount of energy stored in such a battery is
Energy = 12 × 50 = 600 watt-hours = 600 × 3600 = 2.16 × 106 joules.
