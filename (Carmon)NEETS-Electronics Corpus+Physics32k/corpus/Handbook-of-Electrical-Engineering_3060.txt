Tabulations of representative standard ﬁlter speciﬁcation functions appear in the sources in the References by
Schaumann et al. [1990] and Bowron and Stephenson [1979], but more extensive tabulations, including pro-
totype passive ﬁlter component values, are given in A. I. Zverev, Handbook of Filter Synthesis (New York: John
Wiley, 1967). More generally, the Schaumann text provides an admirable, up-to-date coverage of ﬁlter design
with an extensive list of references as does Taylor and Huang [1997].
