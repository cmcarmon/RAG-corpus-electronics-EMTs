Both types of dynamic triggering are represented on a schematic diagram by a special
symbol near the clock input (ﬁgure 7.25). In addition to the clock and data inputs most IC
ﬂip-ﬂop packages will also include set and reset (or mark and erase) inputs. The additional
inputs allow the ﬂip-ﬂop to be preset to an initial state without using the clocked logic inputs.
