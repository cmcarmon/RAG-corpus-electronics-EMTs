. Field windings: These windings reside on the rotor and
provide the primary excitation for the machine. The
windings are supplied with a dc current so that with
rotation, they induce a voltage in the armature windings.
The current is controlled by the exciter to provide the
desired voltage across the armature windings. This cur-
rent must be constrained to avoid overheating of the
windings; the modeling of these limits and excitation of
the control circuit are critical for analysis.
