pn-Junction under Bias
Let an external source be connected between the p- and n-regions, as shown in Figure 7.2.3(a).
Figure 7.2.3(b) shows the circuit representation of the pn-junction or diode, and its external
circuit. The voltage source V, called the bias, either decreases or increases the potential barrier,
thereby controlling the ﬂow of carriers across the junction. With V = 0, the barrier is unaffected
and the pn-junction has zero current. Positive values of V, known as forward biasing, decrease
the potential barrier, thereby increasing the number of electrons and holes diffusing across the
junction. The increased diffusion results in a net current, called the forward current, from the
p- to the n-region. With increased V, the forward current further increases rapidly because the
barrier is reduced even further. Making V negative (reverse biasing), on the other hand, increases
the potential barrier and reduces the number of carriers diffusing across the boundary. The drift
component produced by the electric ﬁeld from the n- to the p-region causes a small current,
called the reverse current (or saturation current) IS. The magnitude of the saturation current
depends on the doping levels in the p- and n-type materials and on the physical size of the
