The forward threshold voltage must be high enough 
to completely remove the depletion layer and force 
charge  carriers  to  move  across  the  junction.  With 
silicon  diodes,  this  forward  threshold  voltage  is 
approximately  0.6  V  to  0.7  V.  With  germanium 
diodes, 
is 
approximately 0.2 V to 0.3 V. 
  Figure 5.6 shows typical characteristics for small 
germanium  and  silicon  diodes.  It  is  worth  noting 
that  diodes  are  limited  by  the  amount  of  forward 
current  and  reverse  voltage  they  can  withstand. 
This  limit  is  based  on  the  physical  size  and 
construction of the diode.
