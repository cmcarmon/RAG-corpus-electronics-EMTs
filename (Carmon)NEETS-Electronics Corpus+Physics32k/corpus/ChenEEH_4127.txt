Figure 4.8 shows the p=4-shifted QPSK signal constellation.
When the phase angles of p=4-shifted QPSK symbols are
differentially encoded, the resulting modulation is p=4-shifted
DQPSK. This can be done either by differential encoding of the
source bits and mapping them onto absolute phase angles or,
alternately, by directly mapping the pairs of input bits onto
relative phase (  p=4  3p=4) as shown in Figure 4.8. The
binary data stream entering the modulator bM (t ) is converted
by a serial-to-parallel converter into two binary streams
bo(t) and be(t) before the bits are differentially encoded (see
Figure 4.9):
