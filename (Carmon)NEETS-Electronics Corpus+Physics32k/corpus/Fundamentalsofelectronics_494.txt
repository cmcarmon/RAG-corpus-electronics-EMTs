Problem 4.19: Catching Speeders with Radar
RU Electronics has been contracted to design a Doppler radar system. Radar transmitters emit a signal that
bounces oﬀ any conducting object. Signal diﬀerences between what is sent and the radar return is processed
and features of interest extracted. In Doppler systems, the object’s speed along the direction of the radar
beam is the feature the design must extract. The transmitted signal is a sinusoid: x (t) = A cos (2πfct). The
