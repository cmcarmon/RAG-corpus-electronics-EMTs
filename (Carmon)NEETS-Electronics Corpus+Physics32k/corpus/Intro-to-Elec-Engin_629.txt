Pure semiconductors, known as intrinsic semiconductors, have very few charge carriers
and may hence be classiﬁed as almost insulators or very poor electrical conductors. However,
by adding (through a process known as doping) tiny controlled amounts of impurities (such
as boron, gallium, indium, antimony, phosphorus, or arsenic), a semiconductor can be made to
contain a desired number of either holes or free electrons and is then known as extrinsic (impure)
material. A p-type semiconductor contains primarily holes, whereas an n-type semiconductor
contains primarily free electrons. While holes are the majority carriers in a p-type material, it
is possible to inject electrons artiﬁcially into p-type material, in which case they become excess
minority carriers. Minority carriers do play a vital role in certain devices. The doping substance
is called an acceptor when the extrinsic semiconductor is the p-type with holes forming the
majority carriers and electrons forming the minority carriers. The doping substance is known as
the donor when the extrinsic semiconductor is the n-type with free electrons forming the majority
carriers and holes forming the minority carriers. Both p- and n-type semiconductors are vitally
important in solid-state device technology. Diodes, transistors, and other devices depend on the
characteristics of a pn-junction formed when the two materials are joined together as a single
crystal.
