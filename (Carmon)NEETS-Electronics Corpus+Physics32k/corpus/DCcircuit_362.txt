This is why its so important never to cut the third prong off a power plug when trying to
ﬁt it into a two-prong receptacle. If this is done, there will be no grounding of the appliance
case to keep the user(s) safe. The appliance will still function properly, but if there is an
internal fault bringing the hot wire in contact with the case, the results can be deadly. If a
two-prong receptacle must be used, a two- to three-prong receptacle adapter can be installed
with a grounding wire attached to the receptacle’s grounded cover screw. This will maintain
the safety of the grounded appliance while plugged in to this type of receptacle.
