The Closed-Loop System
When the plant process is linear or may be linearized about an operating point and the control law is linear
as in expressions (100.83), (100.84), or (100.86), then an appropriate representation of the complete closed-
loop  system  is  by  the  so-called  z-transform.  The  z-transform  plays  the  role  for  linear,  constant-coefﬁcient
difference equations that the Laplace transform plays for linear, constant-coefﬁcient differential equations. This
z-domain representation allows the system designer to investigate system time response, frequency response,
and stability in a single analytical framework.
