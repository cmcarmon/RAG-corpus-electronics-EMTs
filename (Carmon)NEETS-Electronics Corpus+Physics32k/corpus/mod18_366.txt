Many older radar receivers do not use a low-noise amplifier as the receiver front end; they simply
send the echo signal directly to a crystal mixer stage. A crystal is used rather than an electron-tube diode
because, at microwave frequencies, the tube would generate excessive noise. Electron tubes are also
limited by the effects of transit time at microwave frequencies. The crystal most commonly used is the
point-contact crystal diode; however, recent developments in the field of solid-state microwave devices
may soon replace the point-contact diode with devices that produce even less noise. The Schottky-barrier
diode is an example of a relatively recent development that produces less noise than the point-contact
crystal.
