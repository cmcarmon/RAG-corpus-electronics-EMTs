The color difference can be calculated using the Euclidean distance of the (L*, u*, v*) co-ordinates. It follows that a chromaticity distance of

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {(\Delta u')^{2}+(\Delta v')^{2}}}=1/13}
corresponds to the same ΔE*uv as a lightness difference of ΔL* = 1, in direct analogy to CIEUVW.
The Euclidean metric can also be used in CIELCH, with that component of ΔE*uv attributable to difference in hue as ΔH* = √C*1C*2 2 sin (Δh/2), where Δh = h2 – h1.
