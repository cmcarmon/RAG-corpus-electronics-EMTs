The only sure method of determining if a fuse is open is to use a meter. An ohmmeter can be used to
check for an open fuse by removing the fuse from the circuit and checking for continuity through the fuse
(0 ohms). If the fuse is not removed from the circuit, and the fuse is open, the ohmmeter may measure the
circuit resistance. This resistance reading might lead you to think the fuse is good. You must be careful
when you use an ohmmeter to check fuses with small current ratings (such as 1/32 ampere or less),
because the current from the ohmmeter may be larger than the current rating of the fuse. For most
practical uses, a small current capacity fuse can be checked out of the circuit through the use of a resistor.
The ohmic value of the resistor is first measured and then placed in series with the fuse. The continuity
reading on the ohmmeter should be of the same value, or close to it, as the original value of the resistor.
This method provides protection for the fuse by dropping the voltage across the resistor. This in turn
decreases the power in the form of heat at the fuse. Remember, it is heat which melts the fuse element.
