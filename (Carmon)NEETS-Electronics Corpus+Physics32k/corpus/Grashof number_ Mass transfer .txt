There is an analogous form of the Grashof number used in cases of natural convection mass transfer problems. In the case of mass transfer, natural convection is caused by concentration gradients rather than temperature gradients.

Ca,a is the concentration of species a in ambient medium
L is the characteristic length
ν is the kinematic viscosity
