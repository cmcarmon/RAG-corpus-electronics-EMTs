Although the above example is on a second-order differential equa-
tion, any differential equation can be simulated by an analog computer
comprising integrators, inverters, and inverting summers. But care must
be  exercised  in  selecting  the  values  of  the  resistors  and  capacitors,  to
ensure that the op amps do not saturate during the solution time interval.
The analog computers with vacuum tubes were built in the 1950s and
1960s.  Recently  their  use  has  declined.  They  have  been  superseded  by
modern digital computers. However, we still study analog computers for
two reasons. First, the availability of integrated op amps has made it pos-
sible to build analog computers easily and cheaply. Second, understand-
ing analog computers helps with the appreciation of the digital computers.
