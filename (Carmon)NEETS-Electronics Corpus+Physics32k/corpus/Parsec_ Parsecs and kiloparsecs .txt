Distances expressed in parsecs (pc) include distances between nearby stars, such as those in the same spiral arm or globular cluster. A distance of 1000 parsecs (3262 light-years) is commonly denoted by the kiloparsec (kpc). Astronomers typically use kiloparsecs to express distances between parts of a galaxy, or within groups of galaxies. So, for example:
One parsec is approximately 3.26 light-years.
Proxima Centauri, the nearest known star to earth other than the sun, is about 1.30 parsecs (4.24 light-years) away, by direct parallax measurement.
The distance to the open cluster Pleiades is 130±10 pc (420±32.6 ly) from us, per Hipparcos parallax measurement.
The centre of the Milky Way is more than 8 kiloparsecs (26000 ly) from the Earth, and the Milky Way is roughly 34 kpc (110000 ly) across.
The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is about 780 kpc (2.5 million light-years) away from the Earth.
