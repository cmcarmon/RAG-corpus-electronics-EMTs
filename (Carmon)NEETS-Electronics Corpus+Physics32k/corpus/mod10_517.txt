When an rf line is terminated in a short circuit, reflection is complete, but the effect on voltage and
current differs from that in an open-ended line. Voltage is reflected in opposite phase, while current is
reflected in phase. Again refer to the series of pictures shown in figure 3-27. However, this time the left
column represents current, since it shows reflection in phase; and the right column of pictures now
represents the voltage changes on the shorted line, since it shows reflection out of phase.
