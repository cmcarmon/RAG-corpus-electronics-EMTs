Negative mass would possess some strange properties, such as accelerating in the direction opposite of applied force. Despite being inconsistent with the expected behavior of "normal" matter, negative mass is mathematically consistent and introduces no violation of conservation of momentum or energy. It is used in certain speculative theories, such as on the construction of artificial wormholes and the Alcubierre drive. The closest known real representative of such exotic matter is the region of pseudo-negative-pressure density produced by the Casimir effect.
According to mass–energy equivalence, mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
is in proportion to energy



E


{\displaystyle E}
and the coefficient of proportionality is




c

2




{\displaystyle c^{2}}
. Actually,



m


{\displaystyle m}
is still equivalent to



E


{\displaystyle E}
although the coefficient is another constant  such as



−

c

2




{\displaystyle -c^{2}}
. In this case, it is unnecessary to introduce a negative energy because the mass can be negative although the energy is positive. That is to say,




E

The negative momentum is applied to explain negative refraction, inverse Doppler effect and reverse Cherenkov effect observed in a negative index metamaterial. The radiation pressure in the metamaterial is also negative because the force is defined as

In fact, the negative kinetic energy exists in some models to describe dark energy (phantom energy) whose pressure is negative. In this way, the negative mass of exotic matter is now associated with negative momentum, negative pressure, negative kinetic energy and FTL (faster-than-light).
