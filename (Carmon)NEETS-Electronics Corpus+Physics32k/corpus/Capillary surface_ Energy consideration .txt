A deep property of capillary surfaces is the surface energy that is imparted by surface tension:

S



A

S





{\displaystyle E_{S}=\gamma _{S}A_{S}\,}

where



A


{\displaystyle A}
is the area of the surface being considered, and the total energy is the summation of all energies. Note that every interface imparts energy. For example, if there are two different fluids (say liquid and gas) inside a solid container with gravity and other energy potentials absent, the energy of the system is

{\displaystyle E=\sum \gamma _{S}A_{S}=\gamma _{LG}A_{LG}+\gamma _{SG}A_{SG}+\gamma _{SL}A_{SL}\,}

where the subscripts

{\displaystyle SG}

respectively indicate the liquid–gas, solid–gas, and solid–liquid interfaces. Note that inclusion of gravity would require consideration of the volume enclosed by the capillary surface and the solid walls.

Typically the surface tension values between the solid–gas and solid–liquid interfaces are not known. This does not pose a problem; since only changes in energy are of primary interest. If the net solid area

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta E}{\gamma _{LG}}}=\Delta A_{LG}+\Delta A_{SG}\cos(\theta )=\Delta A_{LG}-\Delta A_{SL}\cos(\theta )\,}

where



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the contact angle and the capital delta indicates the change from one configuration to another. To obtain this result, it's necessary to sum (distributed) forces at the contact line (where solid, gas, and liquid meet) in a direction tangent to the solid interface and perpendicular to the contact line:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}0&=\sum F_{\mathrm {Contact\ line} }\\&=\gamma _{LG}\cos(\theta )+\gamma _{SL}-\gamma _{SG}\end{aligned}}}

where the sum is zero because of the static state. When solutions to the Young-Laplace equation aren't unique, the most physically favorable solution is the one of minimum energy, though experiments (especially low gravity) show that metastable surfaces can be surprisingly persistent, and that the most stable configuration can become metastable through mechanical jarring without too much difficulty. On the other hand, a metastable surface can sometimes spontaneously achieve lower energy without any input (seemingly at least) given enough time.
