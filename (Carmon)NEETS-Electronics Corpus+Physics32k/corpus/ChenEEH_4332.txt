Square matrices (n  n) have many special properties and
functions associated with them. In this section, determinants
will be examined Ô¨Årst because they are important in the study
of matrices and their control applications. Following a discus-
sion of determinants, this section will examine more fully the
concept of a matrix multiplicative inverse.
