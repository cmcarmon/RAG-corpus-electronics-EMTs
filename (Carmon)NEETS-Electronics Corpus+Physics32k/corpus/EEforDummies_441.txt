control of electron flow. Put these two capabilities together and you can 
control how fast electrons fill (or charge) a capacitor â€” and how fast those 
electrons empty out (or discharge) from a capacitor. This dynamic duo is so 
popular that circuits containing both resistors and capacitors are known by a 
handy nickname: RC circuits.
