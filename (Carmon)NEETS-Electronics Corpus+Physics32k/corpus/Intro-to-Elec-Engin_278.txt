Earlier we examined the circuit response to sinusoids that have a ﬁxed frequency. Now let us
examine the response of a circuit to a sinusoidal source, called an oscillator, whose frequency can
be varied. Known as the frequency response, it is often expressed as a network function, which is an
output–input ratio. In order to visualize the changes in phase shift and amplitude as the frequency of
