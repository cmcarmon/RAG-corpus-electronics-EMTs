Just like the ﬁxed voltage divider, the potentiometer’s voltage division ratio is strictly a
function of resistance and not of the magnitude of applied voltage. In other words, if the poten-
tiometer knob or lever is moved to the 50 percent (exact center) position, the voltage dropped
between wiper and either outside terminal would be exactly 1/2 of the applied voltage, no mat-
ter what that voltage happens to be, or what the end-to-end resistance of the potentiometer
is. In other words, a potentiometer functions as a variable voltage divider where the voltage
division ratio is set by wiper position.
