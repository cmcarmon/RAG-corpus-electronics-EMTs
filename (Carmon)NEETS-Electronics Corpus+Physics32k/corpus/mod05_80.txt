A drum-type armature is shown in figure 1-13. The armature windings are placed in slots cut in a 
drum-shaped iron core. Each winding completely surrounds the core so that the entire length of the 
conductor cuts the main magnetic field. Therefore, the total voltage induced in the armature is greater 
than in the Gramme-ring. You can see that the drum-type armature is much more efficient than the 
Gramme-ring. This accounts for the almost universal use of the drum-type armature in modem dc 
generators.
