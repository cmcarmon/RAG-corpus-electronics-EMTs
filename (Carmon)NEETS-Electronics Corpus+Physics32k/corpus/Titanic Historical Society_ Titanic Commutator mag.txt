Since its founding in 1963, the Society has regularly distributed a journal to members. Over the years the publication has steadily increased in scope and depth. The Titanic Commutator is now published quarterly as a full-color illustrated magazine reporting on Titanic research and passenger stories, along with other notable ships from the "Golden Age" of transatlantic steamship travel.
At the time of the filming of James Cameron's movie, Titanic the Commutator provided extensive, behind-the-scenes coverage of set construction and details not shown in the final movie release.
