Pressure fluctuations below the free surface of a liquid can drive fluctuating displacements of the liquid surface. This free-surface–turbulence interaction may also be characterized by a wavenumber spectrum. If δ is the instantaneous displacement of the surface from its average position, the mean squared displacement may be represented with a displacement spectrum G(k) as:

A three dimensional form of the pressure spectrum may be combined with the Young–Laplace equation to show that:

{\displaystyle G(k)\propto k^{-19/3}.}

Experimental observation of this k−19/3 law has been obtained by optical measurements of the surface of turbulent free liquid jets.
