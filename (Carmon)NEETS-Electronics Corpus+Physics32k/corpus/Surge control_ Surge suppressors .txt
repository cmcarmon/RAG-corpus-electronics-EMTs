Surge suppressors perform surge relief by acting as a pulsation dampener. Most suppressors have a metal tank with an internal elastic bladder in it. Within the tank they pressurize the top of the bladder with a compressed gas while the product comes in the bottom of the pressure vessel. The gas in the bladder is supplying the system with its set point. During normal operation, as the process conditions begins to build pressure; the internal bladder contracts from the pressure gain allowing liquid to move into the surge suppressor pressure vessel adding volume to the location. This increase in physical volume prevents the pressure from rising to dangerous levels.
Advantages:
1) Very fast speed of response.
2) Zero loss of product from the pipeline from a surge event.
3) Can be used as both a surge suppressor and for surge relief.
Disadvantages:
1) Limited capacity of volume for surge relief.
2) The surge suppressor must be as physically close as possible to the area where the surge is generated. Surge Suppressors can become very large depending on line size.
3) Has a limited maximum working pressure.
