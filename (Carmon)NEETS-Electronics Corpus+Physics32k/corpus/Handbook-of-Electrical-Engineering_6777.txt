architectural concept is a simple one. When a customer places a telephone call which requires special handling,
such as a toll-free call (800 Service) or credit card call, that call is intercepted by the switching system which
suspends call processing while it launches a query through a signaling network to a centralized database. The
database, in turn, retrieves the necessary information to handle the call and returns that information through
the signaling network to the switch so that the call can be completed. The role of the operations support system
is to administer the appropriate network and customer information that resides in the database.
