OPERATION BELOW RESONANCE.â€”When a tuned circuit operates below resonance (figure
3-15), it is capacitive. Secondary current is leads the primary voltage ep and secondary voltage e2 is nearer
in phase with primary voltage ep. The vector sum of e2 and ep is larger than the sum of e1 and ep. The
voltage applied to the anode of CR2 becomes greater than the voltage applied to the cathode of CR1
below resonance.
