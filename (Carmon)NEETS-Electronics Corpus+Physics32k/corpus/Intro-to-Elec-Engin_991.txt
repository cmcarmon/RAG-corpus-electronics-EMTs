where l is the axial length of the stator and r is the average radius at the air gap. For a P-pole
machine, the pole area is 2/P times that of a two-pole machine of the same length and diameter.
The ﬂux linkage with the stator coil is Nφ when the rotor poles are in line with the magnetic
axis of the stator coil. If the rotor is turned at a constant speed ω by a source of mechanical power
connected to its shaft, the ﬂux linkage with the stator coil varies as the cosine of the angle between
the magnetic axes of the stator coil and the rotor,
