2.068 · 10–15 Wb). As in the previous section, the correlated motion of the electrons, here represented by the
superelectron phase, manifests itself through an inductance. This is straightforwardly demonstrated by taking
the  time  derivative  of  Eq.  (53.14)  and  combining  this  expression  with  Eq.  (53.15).  Although  the  resulting
inductance is nonlinear (it depends on cos f), its relative scale is determined by
