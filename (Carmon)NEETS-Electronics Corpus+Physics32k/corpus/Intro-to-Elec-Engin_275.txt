With the aid of theorems concerning Laplace transforms and the table of transforms, lin-
ear differential equations can be solved by the Laplace transform method. Transformations of
the terms of the differential equation yields an algebraic equation in terms of the variable s.
Thereafter, the solution of the differential equation is affected by simple algebraic manipulations
in the s-domain. By inverting the transform of the solution from the s-domain, one can get
back to the time domain. The response due to each term in the partial-fraction expansion is
determined directly from the transform table. There is no need to perform any kind of inte-
gration. Because initial conditions are automatically incorporated into the Laplace transforms
and the constants arising from the initial conditions are automatically evaluated, the resulting
response expression yields directly the total solution. The ï¬‚ow diagram is illustrated in Fig-
ure 3.3.1.
