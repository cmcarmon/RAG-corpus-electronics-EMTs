Hence, for a lossless region, the phase and attenuation vectors
are always perpendicular. In some applications (e.g., a Fourier
transform solution of radiation from an aperture in a ground
plane at z ¼ 0 or from a planar current source at z ¼ 0 [Clem-
mow, 1996]), a plane wave propagating in a lossless region has
