With no armature current, there is no magnetic (motor) reaction. Therefore, the force required to turn 
the armature is low. As the armature current increases, the reaction of each armature conductor against 
rotation increases. The actual force in a generator is multiplied by the number of conductors in the 
armature. The driving force required to maintain the generator armature speed must be increased to 
overcome the motor reaction. The force applied to turn the armature must overcome the motor reaction 
force in all dc generators. The device that provides the turning force applied to the armature is called the 
PRIME MOVER. The prime mover may be an electric motor, a gasoline engine, a steam turbine, or any 
other mechanical device that provides turning force.
