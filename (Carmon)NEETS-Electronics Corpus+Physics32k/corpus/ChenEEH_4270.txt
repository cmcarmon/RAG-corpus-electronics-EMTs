. TDMA is the only technology that offers an efﬁcient use
of hierarchical cell structures (HCSs) offering pico, micro,
and macrocells. HCSs allow coverage for the system to be
tailored to support speciﬁc trafﬁc and service needs. By
using this approach, system capacities of more than 40-
times AMPS can be achieved in a cost-efﬁcient way.
