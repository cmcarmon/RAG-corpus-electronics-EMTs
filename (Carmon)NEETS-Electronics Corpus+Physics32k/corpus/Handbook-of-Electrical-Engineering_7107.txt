relatively  high  power,  and  retransmitted  toward  the  earth.  Transponder  channels  are  generally  rather  broad
(e.g., bandwidths from 24 MHz to more than 100 MHz) and each may contain many individual or user channels.
The  functional  diagram  in  Fig. 74.2  is  appropriate  to  a  satellite  using  frequency-division  duplex  (FDD),
which refers to the fact that the satellites use separate frequency bands for the uplink and downlink and where
 technique, known
both links operate simultaneously. This diagram also illustrates a particular 
as frequency-division multiple access (FDMA), which has been prevalent in mature satellite systems.
