Even  with  the  aggregation  implicit  in  the  engagement  model,  the  encounter  dynamics  are  complex  and
nonlinear. A decisionmaker mentally converts the engagement dynamics into a hybrid equation with separate
descriptions  of  local  and  global  aspects.  The  input-output  dynamics  of  the  commander  are  expressed  as  an
ordinary  differential  equation  with  updates  at  observation  times.  In  Sworder  et al.  [1992],  the  ability  of  the
SHEM  to  predict  the  response  of  a  trained  decisionmaker  was  investigated.  An  experiment  measuring  the
proﬁciency of trained air-defense ofﬁcers in differentiating hostile from friendly targets conﬁrmed the utility
of the SHEM.
