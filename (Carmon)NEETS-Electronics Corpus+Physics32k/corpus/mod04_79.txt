Figure 2-8 shows the steps in making a fixture joint. The first step is to remove the insulation and 
clean the wires to be joined. After the wires are prepared, the fixture wire is wrapped a few times around 
the branch wire. The end of the branch wire is then bent over the completed turns. The remainder of the 
bare fixture wire is then wrapped over the bent branch wire. Soldering and taping completes the job.
