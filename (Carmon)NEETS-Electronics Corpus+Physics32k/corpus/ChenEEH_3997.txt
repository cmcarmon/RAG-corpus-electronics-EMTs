Geometric Transformation
The recent effort to transform a 1-D SFG to 2-D SFG was
exhibited in Yeo and Hu (1995) and Kittitornkum and Hu
(2001) by making use of a spiral and long interconnect. Both
arrays were proposed for full-search block matching motion
estimation, which is one of the most computation-intensive
tasks in real-time digital video coding.
