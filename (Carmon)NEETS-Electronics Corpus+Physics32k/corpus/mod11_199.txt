As with vacuum tubes, the special electronics effects encountered at microwave frequencies severely 
limit the usefulness of transistors in most circuit applications. The need for small-sized microwave 
devices has caused extensive research in this area. This research has produced solid-state devices with 
higher and higher frequency ranges. The new solid-state microwave devices are predominantly active, 
two-terminal diodes, such as tunnel diodes, varactors, transferred-electron devices, and avalanche transit-
time diodes. This section will describe the basic theory of operation and some of the applications of these 
relatively new solid-state devices.
