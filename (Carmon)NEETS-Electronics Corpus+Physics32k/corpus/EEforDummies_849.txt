Creating good vibrations with DC motors
Have you ever wondered what causes your smartphone to vibrate? No, itâ€™s 
not Mexican jumping beans: These devices normally use a DC motor, which 
changes electrical energy (such as the energy stored in a battery) into 
motion. That motion may involve turning the wheels of a robot that you built 
or shaking your smartphone. In fact, you can use a DC motor in any project in 
which you need motion.
