The most bandwidth-efﬁcient analog communication system is the SSB SC system with a
transmission bandwidth equal to the signal bandwidth. In bandwidth-critical applications, such
as voice transmission over microwave and satellite links and some point-to-point communication
systems in congested areas, this system is used widely. When transmission signals have a
signiﬁcant dc component, such as image signals, SSB SC cannot be used because it cannot
effectively transmit direct current. A good compromise is the VSB system (with its bandwidth
slightly larger than SSB and a capability for transmitting dc values), which is widely used in
television broadcasting and some data-communication systems. When bandwidth is the major
