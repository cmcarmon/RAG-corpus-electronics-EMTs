DIFFERENTIATION is the direct opposite of integration. In the RC integrator, the output is taken 
from the capacitor. In the differentiator, the output is taken across the resistor. Likewise, this means that 
when the RL circuit is used as a differentiator, the differentiated output is taken across the inductor.
