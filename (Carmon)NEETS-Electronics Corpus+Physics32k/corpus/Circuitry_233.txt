number  of  gaps  into  which  electrons  can  fit,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  5.3.  These  gaps  are  referred  to  as 
holes. Once  again,  current  will  flow  when  an 
external  potential  difference  is  applied  to  the 
material. 
  Regardless  of  whether  the  impurity  element 
produces  surplus  electrons  or  holes,  the  material 
will no longer behave as an insulator, neither will it 
have the properties that we normally associate with 
a metallic conductor. Instead, we call the material a 
semiconductorâ€”the term simply indicates that the 
substance  is  no  longer  a  good  insulator  or  a  good 
conductor but is somewhere in between! 
  The  process  of  introducing  an  atom  of  another 
(impurity)  element  into  the  lattice  of  an  otherwise 
pure  material  is  called  doping.  When  the  pure 
material  is  doped  with  an  impurity  with  five 
electrons  in  its  valence  shell  (i.e.  a  pentavalent 
impurity) it  will  become  an  N-type  material.  If, 
however,  the  pure  material  is  doped  with  an 
impurity having three electrons in its valence shell 
(i.e.  a  trivalent  impurity) it  will  become  P-type 
material.  N-type  semiconductor  material  contains 
an  excess  of  negative  charge  carriers,  and  P-type 
material  contains  an  excess  of  positive  charge 
carriers.
