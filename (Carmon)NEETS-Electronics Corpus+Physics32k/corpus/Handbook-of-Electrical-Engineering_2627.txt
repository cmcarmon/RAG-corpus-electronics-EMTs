where usat is the carrier saturation velocity, about 107 cm/s for silicon at 290 K, Fsat is the ﬁeld at which velocity
saturation sets in, about 52104 V/cm for electrons and not well established as *105 V/cm for holes in silicon
MOSFETs. For Eq. (24.43) to agree with Eq. (24.42) at long L, we need m » 2usat/Fsat » 400 cm2(V·s) for electrons
in silicon MOSFETs, which is only roughly correct. Nonetheless, we can see that for devices in the submicron
channel length regime, ID,sat tends to become independent of channel length L and becomes more linear with
VG – VTH and less quadratic (see Fig. 24.44). Equation (24.43) shows that velocity saturation is signiﬁcant when
VG/L * Fsat for example, when L & 0.5 mm if VG - VTH = 2.5 V.
