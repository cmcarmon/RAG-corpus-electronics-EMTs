The requirements for digital communications for civil aircraft have grown so signiﬁcantly that the industry
as a whole embarked on a virtually total upgrade of the communications system elements. The goal is to achieve
a high level of ﬂexibility in processing varying types of information as well as attaining compatibility between
a wide variety of communication devices. The approach bases both ground system and avionics design on the
ISO Open System Interconnect (OSI) model. This seven-layer model separates the various factors of commu-
nications into clearly deﬁnable elements of physical media, protocols, addressing, and information identiﬁcation.
The implementation of the OSI model requires a much higher level of complexity in the avionics as compared
to avionics designed for simple dedicated point-to-point communications. The avionics interface to the physical
