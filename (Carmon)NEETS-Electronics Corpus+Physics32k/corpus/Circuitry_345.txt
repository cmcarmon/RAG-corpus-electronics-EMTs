Example 7.2 
 
Determine  the  mid-band  voltage  gain  and  upper 
and  lower  cut-off  frequencies  for  the  amplifier 
whose frequency response is shown in Fig. 7.12. 
 
Solution 
 
The  mid-band  voltage  gain  corresponds  with  the 
flat part of the frequency response characteristic. At 
the point the voltage gain reaches a maximum of 35 
(see Fig. 7.12).  
  The  voltage  gain  at  the  two  cut-off  frequencies 
can be calculated from: 
 
Av cut-off = 0.707 × Av max = 0.707 × 35 = 24.7 
 
This  value  of  gain 
the  frequency 
response graph at f1 = 57 Hz and f2 = 590 kHz (see 
Fig. 7.12).
