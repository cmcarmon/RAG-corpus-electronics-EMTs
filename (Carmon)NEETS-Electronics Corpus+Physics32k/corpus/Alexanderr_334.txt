Observe from Eq. (7.8) that the smaller the time constant, the more
rapidly  the  voltage  decreases,  that  is,  the  faster  the  response.  This  is
illustrated in Fig. 7.4. A circuit with a small time constant gives a fast
response in that it reaches the steady state (or ﬁnal state) quickly due
to  quick  dissipation  of  energy  stored,  whereas  a  circuit  with  a  large
time  constant  gives  a  slow  response  because  it  takes  longer  to  reach
steady  state. At  any  rate,  whether  the  time  constant  is  small  or  large,
the circuit reaches steady state in ﬁve time constants.
