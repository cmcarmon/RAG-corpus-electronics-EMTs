Textbooks  on  programming  usually  address  the  subject  of  good  programming  style  in  great  detail.  More
information can be found in articles on object-oriented programming and design and on software engineering
as  published,  for  example,  in  the  proceedings  of  the  annual  conferences  on  Object  Oriented  Programming
Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
and on Computer Software and Applications (CompSac) sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers, Inc. (IEEE). Articles on the subject are also found in periodicals such as IEEE Transactions on Software
Engineering,  IEEE  Transactions  on  Computers,  ACM  Transactions  on  Software  Engineering  and  Methodology,
Software  Engineering  Notes  published  by  the  ACM  Special  Interest  Group  on  Software  Engineering,  ACM
Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems, the Communications of the ACM, or Acta Informatica.
