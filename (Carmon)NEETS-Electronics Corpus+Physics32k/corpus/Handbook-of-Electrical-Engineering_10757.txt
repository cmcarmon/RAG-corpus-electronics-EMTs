The number of occurrences X in (0, t) is a discrete random variable with a mean value m of (lt) and a standard
deviation s of 
. By setting X = 0 in Eq. (110.12), we obtain the probability of no occurrence in (0,t) as e–lt.
If the event is failure, then no occurrence means success and e–lt is the probability of success or system reliability.
This is the well-known and often-used exponential distribution, also known as the constant-hazard model.
