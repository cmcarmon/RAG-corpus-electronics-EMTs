The in vivo experiments using the 0.3-mT pulse produced “a 22% increase in the rate of regeneration relative
to  controls”  as  measured  by  a  standardized  test  of  reﬂex  response.  A  very  interesting  observation  was  that
animals exposed to the 0.3-mT ﬁeld for 4 h/day for 7 days prior to the crush injury, who received no treatment
after injury, responded similarly to those treated postinjury. Analysis of extracts from sciatic nerve segments
after sacriﬁce of the animals showed that treatment with PEMF changed the molecular weight distribution of
synthesized polypeptides.
