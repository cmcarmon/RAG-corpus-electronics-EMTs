Resonant-Link DC-DC Converters
The  use  of  resonant  converter  topologies  would  help  to  reduce  the  switching  losses  in  dc-dc  converters  and
enable the operation at switching frequencies in the megahertz range. By operating at high frequencies, the size
of  the  power  supplies  could  be  reduced.  There  are  several  types  of  resonant  converter  topologies.  The  most
popular conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 30.18. The dc power is converted to high-frequency alternating power
using the MOSFET half-bridge inverter. The resonant capacitor voltage is transformer-coupled, rectiﬁed using
the two Schottky diodes, and then ﬁltered to get output dc voltage. The output voltage is regulated by control
of the inverter switching frequency.
