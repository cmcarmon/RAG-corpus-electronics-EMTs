Capacitor life expectancy is doubled for each 10(cid:176)C decrease in operating temperature, so a capacitor operating
at room temperature will have a life expectancy 64 times that of the same capacitor operating at 85(cid:176)C (185(cid:176)F).
The surge voltage speciÔ¨Åcation of a capacitor determines its ability to withstand high transient voltages that
generally  occur  during  the  starting  up  period  of  equipment.  Standard  tests  generally  specify  a  short  on  and
long off period for an interval of 24 h or more, and the allowable surge voltage levels are generally 10% above
the rated voltage of the capacitor.
