The resonant (front) head is usually looser than the batter head and is mainly responsible for the fundamental, audible tone of the drum.
The resonant head can have a small (approximately 6") offset hole to allow for air pressure to escape and to support the insertion of a microphone.
Some drummers muffle bass drum tone by inserting a towel, blanket, or similar material.
