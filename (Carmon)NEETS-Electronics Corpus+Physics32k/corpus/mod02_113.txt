 Whenever two coils are located so that the flux from one coil links with the turns of the other coil, a 
change of flux in one coil causes an emf to be induced in the other coil. This allows the energy from one 
coil to be transferred or coupled to the other coil. The two coils are said to be coupled or linked by the 
property of MUTUAL INDUCTANCE (M). The amount of mutual inductance depends on the relative 
positions of the two coils. This is shown in figure 2-12. If the coils are separated a considerable distance, 
the amount of flux common to both coils is small and the mutual inductance is low. Conversely, if the 
coils are close together so that nearly all the flux of one coil links the turns of the other, the mutual 
inductance is high. The mutual inductance can be increased greatly by mounting the coils on a common 
iron core.
