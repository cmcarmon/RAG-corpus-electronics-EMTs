dedicated designs, the challenge lies in a thorough understanding of the DSP algorithms and theory of archi-
tectures.  For  example,  just  minimizing  the  number  of  multipliers  in  an  algorithm  may  not  lead  to  a  better
dedicated design. The area saved by the number of multipliers may be offset by the increase in control, routing,
and placement costs.
