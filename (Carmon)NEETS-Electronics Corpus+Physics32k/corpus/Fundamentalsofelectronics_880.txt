Shannon’s Noisy Channel Coding Theorem says that if the data aren’t transmitted too quickly, that error
correction codes exist that can correct all the bit errors introduced by the channel. Unfortunately, Shannon
did not demonstrate an error correcting code that would achieve this remarkable feat; in fact, no one has
