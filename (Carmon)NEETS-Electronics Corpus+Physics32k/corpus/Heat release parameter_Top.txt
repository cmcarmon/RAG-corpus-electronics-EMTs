In Combustion, heat release parameter is a dimensionless parameter which measures the amount of heat released by the combustion process. It is defined as




α
=




T

f


−

T

o




T

f






{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {T_{f}-T_{o}}{T_{f}}}}

where





T

f




{\displaystyle T_{f}}
is the flame temperature





T

o




{\displaystyle T_{o}}
is the unburnt mixture temperature.
In typical combustion process,



α
∼
0.7
−
0.9


{\displaystyle \alpha \sim 0.7-0.9}
.
