where S(ƒ) = F[s(t)] is the Fourier transform of the known input signal s(t) of duration T sec. Pn(ƒ) is the PSD
of the input noise, t0 is the sampling time when (S/N)out is evaluated, and K is an arbitrary real nonzero constant.
A general representation for a matched ﬁlter is illustrated in Fig. 70.11. The input signal is denoted by s(t)
