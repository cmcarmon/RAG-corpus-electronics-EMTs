Kinematic viscosity can be estimated as a typical (thermal) velocity times the mean free path. A molecular view of liquids can be used for a qualitative picture of decrease in the shear (or bulk) viscosity of a simple fluid with temperature. As the temperature increases, the thermal velocity increases. However, much more important is the rapid decrease of the mean free path with temperature. The reason for this is that temperature increase releases more and more molecules to move around and interact with any given molecule. The actual process can be quite complex and is typically represented by simplified mathematical or empirical models, some of which are discussed below. The models are valid over limited temperature ranges and for selected materials.
