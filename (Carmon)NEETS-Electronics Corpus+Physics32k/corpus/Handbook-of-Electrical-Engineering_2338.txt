Low-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a BJT. As in the low-frequency large-signal model,
the junction capacitances, CjC and CjE, and the diffusion capacitances, CDE and CDC, can be neglected. Further-
more, the base resistance, rb, can also be neglected, because the voltage drop across the base is not signiÔ¨Åcant
and the variations in the base width caused by changes in the collector-base voltage are also very small. The
low-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit model is shown in Fig. 22.30.
