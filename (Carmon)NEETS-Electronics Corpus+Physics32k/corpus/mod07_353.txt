"depletion region" to form around the PN junction of the JFET. Because this region has a reduced number 
of current carriers, the effect of reverse biasing is to reduce the effective cross-sectional area of the 
"channel." This reduction in area increases the source-to-drain resistance of the device and decreases 
current flow.
