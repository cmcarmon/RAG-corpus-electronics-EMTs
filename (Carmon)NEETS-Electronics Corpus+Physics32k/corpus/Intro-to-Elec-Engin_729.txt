A single-stage ampliﬁer is one in which there is only one amplifying element. By combining
several single-stage ampliﬁer circuits, a multistage ampliﬁer is produced. Audio ampliﬁers are
designed to amplify signals in the frequency range of 30 to 15,000 Hz perceptible to the human
ear. A video ampliﬁer is designed to amplify the signal frequencies needed for television imaging
(see Chapter 15). An ampliﬁer, in general, is then made up of a cascade of several stages. A stage
usually consists of an elementary ampliﬁer, which normally has only one transistor. The cascade
is formed by making the output of the ﬁrst stage as the input of the second stage, the output of
the second stage as the input of the third stage, and so on. This section is devoted to the study of
three basic forms of ampliﬁer stages which use a BJT.
