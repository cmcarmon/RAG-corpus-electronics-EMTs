Any frequency, when modulated by another frequency, will produce a base frequency with sideband 
frequencies (sum and difference). In other words, the output of a pulsed radar will contain more than one 
frequency. The output frequency spectrum of the pulsed radar transmitter does not consist of just a single 
frequency that is turned on and off at the pulse-repetition frequency (prf). Consider the spectrum as a base 
frequency (carrier) that is modulated by short rectangular pulses occurring at the prf of the radar. Two 
distinct modulating components are present: One component consists of the prf and its associated 
harmonics; the other component consists of the fundamental and odd-harmonic frequencies that make up 
the rectangular modulating pulse.
