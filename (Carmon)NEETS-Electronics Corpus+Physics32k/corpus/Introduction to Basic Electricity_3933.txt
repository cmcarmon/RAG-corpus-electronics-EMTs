To reduce the effects of shunt capacitance and 
 increase the frequency response in transistor video 
amplifiers, peaking coils are used. Figure 38-12 shows 
the shunt-peaking method. A small inductor is 
placed in series with the load resistor. At the low- and 
mid-frequency ranges, the peaking coil has little effect 
on the amplifier response. At the higher frequencies, 
the inductor resonates with the circuitâ€™s capacitance, 
which results in an increase in the output impedance 
and boosts the gain.
