Now that we have covered the basic operation of the control synchro system, let us see how this 
system works with a servo system to move heavy equipment. Figure 1-28 shows a block diagram of a 
typical servo system that uses a control synchro system. Assume the shaft of the CX in this system is 
turned by some mechanical input. This causes an error signal to be generated by the CT because the CX 
and the CT rotors are now out of correspondence. The error signal is amplified by the servoamplifier and 
applied to the servomotor. The servomotor turns the load, and through a mechanical linkage called 
RESPONSE, also turns the rotor of the CT. The servomotor turns the rotor of the CT so that it is once 
again in correspondence with the rotor of the CX, the error signal drops to zero volts, and the system 
comes to a stop.
