Of immediate interest are the expressions for the branch variables that
control dependent sources. In our example, this branch variable is i. Next, we
substitute these expressions for the controlling variables into the element laws
for the dependent sources, and self-consistently solve for the actual values of the
dependent sources. Continuing with our dependent current source example of
