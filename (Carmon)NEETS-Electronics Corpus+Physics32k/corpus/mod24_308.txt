The ribbon cable design has the highest fiber capacity. Ribbon cables can hold 204 fibers in a
0.5-inch cable. However, ribbon cables have worse bend performance than OFCC and stranded cables.
Ribbon cables also have the poorest waterblocking capabilities of the three cable designs. The bend
performance is expected to worsen if manufacturers add appropriate compounds to increase
waterblocking capabilities.
