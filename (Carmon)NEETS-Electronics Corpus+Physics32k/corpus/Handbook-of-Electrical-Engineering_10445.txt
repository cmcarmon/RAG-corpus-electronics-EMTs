Input information is corrupted by measurement noise. Thus, “corruption” tends to zero when the set ᏺ is
a singleton ᏺ = {0}. On the other hand, partialness of information can disappear in two different ways. By a
priori assumptions when the set S tends to have only one element (the real system) or a posterior measurements
when the amount of experimental information is completed by the remaining (usually inﬁnite) data points.
This  can  be  uniﬁed  as  follows.  The  available  information  (a  priori  and  a  posteriori)  is  completed  when  the
consistency set S(y) tends to only one element: the real system. Hence, an identiﬁcation algorithm A converges
if and only if
