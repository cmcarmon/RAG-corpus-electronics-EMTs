and attention is focused on the repeating waveform thereafter. This would be
the case if we were using the circuit as a rectifier to convert a 60-Hertz AC
signal to DC to supply DC power to Op Amps and MOSFETs. Rather than
solving Equation 16.17 for the turn-on time, and then calculating the capacitor
voltage at turn-on, we just assume the transient continues for the complete
period of the sine wave. This gives a slightly larger ripple than the actual value,
so designs based on this approximation will be conservative. We are in effect
assuming that Equation 16.16 applies for the entire period Ï„ of the input sine
wave, and at the end of one cycle, vC instantly jumps to Vp, then decays
again. Under this assumption the peak-to-peak value of the ripple will be, from
Equation 16.16,
