either at or below the surface depending on the doping proÔ¨Åle
in the channel region. Surface punchthrough occurs for uni-
formly doped substrates and results in the loss of gate control
of the channel region, causing the device to fail. Bulk punch-
through occurs for ion-implanted channels that have a higher
doping concentration at the surface. In this condition, there
still exists a channel that is gate controlled, but the background
leakage becomes very high and is strongly dependent on VDS.
The common solution is to add a shallow punchthrough
implant typically placed immediately below the threshold
adjust implant. This raises the doping density under the chan-
nel while keeping the bulk doping density as low as possible.
The goal is to minimize junction depletion region capacitance,
which has an impact on device switching speed.
