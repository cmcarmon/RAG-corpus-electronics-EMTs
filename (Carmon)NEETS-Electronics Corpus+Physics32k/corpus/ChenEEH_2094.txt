The enabling condition of an elementary transition is de-
ﬁned exactly the same as that of an HLPN ’s in Section 9.2. A
super transition is enabled if at least one of its interface child
transitions in IN is enabled and its ﬁring is deﬁned by an
execution sequence of its child transitions; thus, its behavior
is fully deﬁned by its child transitions. The ﬁring rule of a
transition is formally deﬁned in He (1996). Two transitions
(including the same transition with two different occurrence
modes) can ﬁre concurrently if they are not in conﬂict (the
ﬁring of one of them disables the other). Conﬂicts are resolved
