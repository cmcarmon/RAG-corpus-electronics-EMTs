Diffused Junction Detector
Silicon detectors can be generically categorized by the type of rectifying contact employed. The diffused junction
detector is fabricated by diffusing phosphorus from the gas phase into p-type silicon. This is a high-temperature
(900°C  to  1200°C)  operation  that  is  prone  to  introducing  faster  diffusing  metals  into  the  bulk  that  can  act
either as generation centers increasing leakage current, or as trapping centers degrading charge collection. The
thickness of the diffused region, from 0.1 to 2.0 µ, also presents a dead layer to incident particles that is reduced
in alternate technologies. Nonetheless, these detectors ﬁnd use due to their ruggedness and economy.
