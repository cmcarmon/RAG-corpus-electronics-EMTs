Shielding
The control of near- and far-ﬁeld coupling (radiation) is accomplished using shielding techniques. The ﬁrst
step in the design of a shield is to determine what undesired ﬁeld level may exist at a point with no shielding

and what the tolerable ﬁeld level is. The difference between the two then is the needed
