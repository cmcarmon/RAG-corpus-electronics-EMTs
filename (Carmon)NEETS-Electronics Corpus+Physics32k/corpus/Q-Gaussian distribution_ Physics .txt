It has been shown that the momentum distribution of cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices is a q-Gaussian.
The q-Gaussian distribution is also obtained as the asymptotic probability density function of the position of the unidimensional motion of a mass subject to two forces: a deterministic force of the type
