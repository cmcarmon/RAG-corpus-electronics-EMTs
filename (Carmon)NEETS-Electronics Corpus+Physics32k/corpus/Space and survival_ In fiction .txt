Space as an aid to human survival is a staple themes of science fiction. Among the examples are:
In the 1972 film Silent Running, a set of space stations out orbiting Saturn contain the remnants of Earth's ecosystem, after Earth's was destroyed by pollution.
In the Arthur C. Clarke short story "If I Forget Thee, Oh Earth", humans are surviving on the Moon after the Earth was rendered uninhabitable by a nuclear war.
In Gateway by Frederik Pohl, those with the money to leave the dying Earth can hitch a ride on a starship that will either make them extremely wealthy or lead them to their death.
In the 2005 John Scalzi novel Old Man’s War, Earth itself is a backwater and the Colonial Defense Force must fight for the scarce habitable planets left.
In the Jack Vance omnibus volume Dying Earth, a far-future Earth is under a giant red sun that is about to go out forever.
The 2014 blockbuster “Interstellar” starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway follows the plot where a global crop blight and second Dust Bowl are slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole.
“Exogenesis Symphony” - a three part song by British rock band Muse. The song follows the journey of mankind and details the difficulties and actions that face Earth’s end. Part 1 (Overture) is the “jaded acceptance that civilisation will end” according to frontman Matthew Bellamy. He also states that Part 2 (Cross-Pollination) is “a desperate hope that sending astronauts to find and populate other planets will be successful alongside the recognition that this is the last hope”. Part 3 (Redemption) concludes the song and its source album, "The Resistance" (2009). The final part is a recognition by the astronauts that the extinction of Earth is a continuous cycle and that humanity must change its ways in order to save itself.
