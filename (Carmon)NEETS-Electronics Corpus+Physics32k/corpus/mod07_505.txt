The schematic drawing in view A is that of a shunt-type regulator. It is called a shunt-type regulator 
because the regulating device is connected in parallel with the load resistance. The schematic drawing in 
view B is that of a series regulator. It is called a series regulator because the regulating device is 
connected in series with the load resistance. Figure 4-32 illustrates the principle of series voltage 
regulation. As you study the figure, notice that the regulator is in series with the load resistance (RL) and 
that the fixed resistor (RS) is in series with the load resistance.
