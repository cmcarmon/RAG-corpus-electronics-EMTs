Figure 6.18 shows a sample input waveform and the corresponding output
waveform for our circuit. We can also plot the vIN versus vOUT voltage transfer
curve for the inverter circuit as shown in Figure 6.19. The input-output transfer
curve for the inverter
allows us to
determine whether the inverter satisfies a given static discipline. We will discuss
the inverter characteristic and how it relates to the static discipline in Section 6.5.
We can also construct other gates in like manner. Figure 6.20 shows a
NAND gate circuit and Figure 6.21 shows its equivalent S circuit model. It is
