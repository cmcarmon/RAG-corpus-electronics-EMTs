Around every electrically charged object is a force field that can be detected and measured. This
force field can cause electric charges to move in the field. When an object is charged electrically, there is
either a greater or a smaller concentration of electrons than normal. Thus, a difference of potential exists
between a charged object and an uncharged object. An electric field is, therefore, associated with a
difference of potential, or a voltage.
