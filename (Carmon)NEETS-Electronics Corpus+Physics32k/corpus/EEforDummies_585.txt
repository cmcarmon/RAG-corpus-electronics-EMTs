To understand why the LED was off when the pot was set to 0 Ω and then 
turned on as you increased the pot resistance, consider the circuit if you 
remove the LED. The circuit is a voltage divider (described in Chapter 6), 
and the voltage across the pot (resistor R2) — which is the same as the LED 
 voltage — is given by a ratio of resistance times the supply voltage:
