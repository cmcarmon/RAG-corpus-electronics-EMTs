stator winding of the induction machine is ex-
cited from a 60-Hz supply, while the variable-
frequency three-phase power is taken out of the
slip rings. The output frequency range is to be
120 to 420 Hz; the maximum speed is not to
exceed 3000 r/min; and the maximum power
output at 420 Hz is to be 70 kW at 0.8 power
factor. Assuming that the maximum-speed condi-
tion determines the machine size, and neglecting
exciting current, losses, and voltage drops in the
induction machine, calculate:
(a) The minimum number of poles for the induc-
