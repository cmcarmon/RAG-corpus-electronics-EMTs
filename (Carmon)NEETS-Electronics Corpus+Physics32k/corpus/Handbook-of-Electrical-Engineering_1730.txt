The second step in image encoding is vector quantization. This is essentially a clustering step in which we
partition  the  feature  space  into  cells,  each  of  which  will  be  represented  by  a  single  prototype  feature  vector.
Since all feature vectors belonging to a given cell are mapped to the same prototype, the quantization process
is  irreversible  and,  hence,  cannot  be  used  as  part  of  a  lossless  compression  algorithm.  Figure  17.7  shows  an
example for a two-dimensional feature space. Each dot corresponds to one feature vector from the image. The
Xâ€™s signify the prototypes used to represent all the feature vectors contained within its quantization cell, the
boundary of which is indicated by the dashed lines. Despite the simplicity with which vector quantization may
be described, the implementation of a vector quantizer is a computationally complex task unless some structure
is  imposed  on  it.  The  clustering  is  based  on  minimizing  the  distortion  between  the  original  and  quantized
feature vectors, averaged over the entire image. The distortion measure can be chosen to account for the relative
sensitivity of the human viewer to different kinds of degradation. In one dimension, the vector quantizer reduces
to the Lloyd-Max scalar quantizer.
