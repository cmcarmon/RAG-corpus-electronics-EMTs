, or material emitting the laser beam, can be a gas,
liquid, glass, crystalline solid, or semiconductor crystal and can range in size from a grain of salt to Ô¨Ålling the
inside  of  a  moderate-sized  building.  Not  every  laser  produces  a  narrow  beam  of  monochromatic,  coherent
light. Semiconductor diode lasers, for example, produce beams that spread out over an angle of 20 to 40 degrees,
hardly a pencil-thin beam. Liquid dye lasers emit at a broad or narrow range of wavelengths, depending on
the optics used with them. Other types emit at a number of spectral lines, producing light that is neither truly
monochromatic nor coherent. Table 31.1 summarizes important commercial lasers.
