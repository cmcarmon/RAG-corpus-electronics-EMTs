From a networking perspective, all media types can be classi-
ﬁed as either real-time (RT) or non real-time (NRT), as shown
in Figure 7.2. RT media types require either hard or soft
bounds on the end-to-end packet delay/jitter, while NRT
media types, like text and image ﬁles, do not have any strict
delay constraints but may have rigid constraints on error.
