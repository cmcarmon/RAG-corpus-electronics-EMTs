where τ is known as the time constant. After a time of one time constant has elapsed, looking at
Equation (1.1.26a), the value of the waveform will be reduced to 37% of its initial value; Equation
(1.1.26b) shows that the value will rise to 63% of its ﬁnal value. The student is encouraged to
study the functions graphically and deduce the results.
