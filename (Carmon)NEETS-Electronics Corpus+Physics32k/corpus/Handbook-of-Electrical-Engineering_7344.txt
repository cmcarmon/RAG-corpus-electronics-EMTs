Yet the vast distances spanned by telemetry signals are less challenging technically than the stubborn problems
of almost sheer inaccessibility in some industrial applications to the quantities being measured. Signals from
a  missile-launched  space  probe  soaring  toward  the  sun  are  often  easier  to  obtain  than  measurements  from
inside  a  stolid,  earthbound  motor  only  a  foot  or  two  away.  To  ﬁnd  the  temperature  of  the  spinning  rotor,
housed in a steel casing and surrounded by a strong alternating magnetic ﬁeld, may require more ingenuity to
transcend  the  operating  environment  than  taking  measurements  from  the  most  distant  instrument  payload
speeding through the unaccommodating environment of space.
