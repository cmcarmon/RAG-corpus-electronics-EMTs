Equation (24.46) suggests that tD will show a similar improvement to tG as L is reduced, provided that CD/CG
does not increase as L is reduced. However, Cox (cid:181)  L/d, and the major component of Cpar, namely, the overlap
capacitance contribution, leads to Cpar (cid:181) Lovlp/d where Lovlp is roughly three times the length of overlap of the
gate over the source or drain [Chen, 1990]. Then CG (cid:181) (L + Lovlp)/d and, to keep the CD/CG ratio from increasing
as L is reduced, either CD or oxide-thickness d must be reduced along with L .
