Instrumentation
As yet there is no American National Standard for EMG, although steps are being taken in this direction. As
shown in Fig. 113.18, the EMG is displayed in two ways: (1) visually with an oscilloscope and (2) aurally with
a loudspeaker. Both are needed to enable acquisition and analysis of the EMG.
