2. RTH can be found by calculating or measuring the resistance of the
open-circuit network seen from the designated terminal pair with all
independent sources internal to the network set to zero. That is,
with independent voltage sources replaced with short circuits, and
independent current sources replaced with open circuits. (Dependent
sources must be left intact, however.)
