6.13 Digital Communication15
Eﬀective, error-free transmission of a sequence of bits—a bit stream {b (0) , b (1) , . . .}—is the goal here. We
found that analog schemes, as represented by amplitude modulation, always yield a received signal containing
noise as well as the message signal when the channel adds noise. Digital communication schemes are very
diﬀerent. Once we decide how to represent bits by analog signals that can be transmitted over wireline
(like a computer network) or wireless (like digital cellular telephone) channels, we will then develop a way
of tacking on communication bits to the message bits that will reduce channel-induced errors greatly. In
theory, digital communication errors can be zero, even though the channel adds noise!
