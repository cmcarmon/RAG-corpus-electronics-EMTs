Modern semiconductor devices are often so small that their
dimensions are comparable to or even smaller than the elec-
tron mean free path. In this case, electrons may acquire higher
velocities than those shown in Figure 6.9, since transient effects
associated with acceleration of carriers become important. In
the limiting case of very short devices, the electron transit time
may become so small that most electrons will not experience
any collisions during the transit. Such a mode of electron
transport is called ballistic transport.
