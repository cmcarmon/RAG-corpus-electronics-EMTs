The DTL NAND gate circuit shown in Figure 9.2.1 and others closely related to it belong to
the DTL logic family. Since all circuits in the same family have the same high and low ranges,
they can be interconnected to build up digital systems. Although we have described the DTL gate
as our Ô¨Årst example for our convenience and easy understanding, the DTL technology is almost
obsolete and is replaced by TTL.
