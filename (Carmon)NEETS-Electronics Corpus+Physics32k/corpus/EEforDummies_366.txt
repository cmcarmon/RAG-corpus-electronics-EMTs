Capacitors make it possible to change the shape (the 
pattern over time) of electrical signals carried by 
current — a task resistors alone cannot perform. 
Although they’re not as straightforward to under-
stand as resistors, capacitors are essential ingre-
dients in many of the electronic and industrial 
systems you enjoy today, such as radio receivers, 
computer memory devices, and automobile airbag‐
deployment systems, so it’s well worth investing 
your time and brain power in understanding how 
capacitors operate.
