Orbital Mechanics (Rocket and Space Technology)
Orbital simulations by Varadi, Ghil and Runnegar (2003) provide another, slightly different series for Earth orbit eccentricity, and also a series for orbital inclination. Orbits for the other planets were also calculated, by F. Varadi; B. Runnegar; M. Ghil (2003). "Successive Refinements in Long-Term Integrations of Planetary Orbits". The Astrophysical Journal. 592: 620â€“630. Bibcode:2003ApJ...592..620V. doi:10.1086/375560. , but only the eccentricity data for Earth and Mercury are available online.
Understand orbits using direct manipulation. Requires JavaScript and Macromedia
