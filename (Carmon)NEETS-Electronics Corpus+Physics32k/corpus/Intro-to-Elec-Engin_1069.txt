12.4.1 Consider the electromagnetic plunger shown in
Figure P12.4.1. The λ–i relationship for the nor-
mal working range is experimentally found to be
λ = Ki2/3/(x+ t ), where K is a constant. Deter-
mine the electromagnetic force on the plunger
by the application of Equations (12.4.19) and
(12.4.20). Interpret the signiﬁcance of the sign
that you obtain in the force expression.
