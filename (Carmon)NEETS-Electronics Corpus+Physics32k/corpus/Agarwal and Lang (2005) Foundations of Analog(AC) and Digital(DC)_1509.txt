As discussed in Section 6.1, a circuit containing a switch can be ana-
lyzed by considering two linear subcircuits: one for the switch in its ON state
(see Figure 10.54) and one for the switch in its OFF state (see Figure 10.56).
A high on the store terminal turns the switch on, and results in the circuit
illustrated in Figure 10.54. The capacitor then charges up (or discharges) to
the value of the input voltage at the dIN terminal when the switch is turned on.
Remember, the switch is symmetric about its input and output terminals. Thus,
for example, if the dIN terminal had a high voltage corresponding to a logical
1 (produced, for example, by a voltage source, as illustrated in Figure 10.55),
the capacitor will offer a high voltage at the node marked with an asterisk
when the store signal is asserted. In this situation, the ideal external voltage
source charges up the capacitor instantly through the ideal switch (assuming
the capacitor had a low voltage initially). Alternatively, if the dIN terminal had a
low voltage corresponding to a logical 0, the capacitor will offer a low voltage
at the node marked with an asterisk when the store signal is asserted. In this
latter situation, the capacitor discharges instantly through the ideal switch and
the ideal external voltage source (assuming that the capacitor had a high voltage
initially) and attains the same voltage as the voltage source.
