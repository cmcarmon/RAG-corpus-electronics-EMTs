Problems 
 
3.1   A  power  supply 
 
 
 
 
3.2   A 15 V d.c. supply delivers a total current of 
300  mA.  If  this  current  is  shared  equally 
 
 
between 
the 
 
resistance of each circuit. 
3.3   Determine  the  unknown  current  in  each 
 
3.4   Determine  the  unknown  voltage  in  each 
 
3.5   Determine  all  currents  and  voltages  in  Fig. 
 
3.6   Two  resistors,  one  of  120  F and  one  of  
 
680  F are  connected  as  a  potential  divider 
across a 12 V supply. Determine the voltage 
 
 
developed across each resistor. 
3.7   Two resistors, one of 15 F and one of 5 F
are connected in parallel. If a current of 2 A 
is applied to the combination, determine the 
current flowing in each resistor.
