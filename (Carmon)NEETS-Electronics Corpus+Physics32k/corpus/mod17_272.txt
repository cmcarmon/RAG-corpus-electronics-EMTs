many of the frequency generators (local oscillators) used in communications equipment. Variable
frequency oscillators cannot practically achieve this high degree of stability. Therefore, a system known
as FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS has been developed to meet the stringent demands for stability. This
system uses circuitry that produces a signal frequency through a heterodyning and frequency selection
process. This signal is not harmonically related to any of the signals used in the heterodyning process. It
is also not related to the selected crystal frequency. This makes the signal unique.
