In special relativity, an object that has nonzero rest mass cannot travel at the speed of light. As the object approaches the speed of light, the object's energy and momentum increase without bound.
In the first years after 1905, following Lorentz and Einstein, the terms longitudinal and transverse mass were still in use. However, those expressions were replaced by the concept of relativistic mass, an expression which was first defined by Gilbert N. Lewis and Richard C. Tolman in 1909. They defined the total energy and mass of a body as





m

rel


=


E

c

2







{\displaystyle m_{\text{rel}}={\frac {E}{c^{2}}}\!}
,
and of a body at rest





m

0


=



E

0



c

2







{\displaystyle m_{0}={\frac {E_{0}}{c^{2}}}\!}
,
with the ratio







m

rel



m

0




=
γ



{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{\text{rel}}}{m_{0}}}=\gamma \!}
.
Tolman in 1912 further elaborated on this concept, and stated: “the expression m0(1 - v2/c2)−1/2 is best suited for THE mass of a moving body.”
In 1934, Tolman argued that the relativistic mass formula




m

rel


=
E

/


c

2





{\displaystyle m_{\text{rel}}=E/c^{2}\!}
holds for all particles, including those moving at the speed of light, while the formula




m

rel


=
γ

m

0





{\displaystyle m_{\text{rel}}=\gamma m_{0}\!}
only applies to a slower than light particle (a particle with a nonzero rest mass). Tolman remarked on this relation that "We have, moreover, of course the experimental verification of the expression in the case of moving electrons to which we shall call attention in §29. We shall hence have no hesitation in accepting the expression as correct in general for the mass of a moving particle."
When the relative velocity is zero,



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is simply equal to 1, and the relativistic mass is reduced to the rest mass as one can see in the next two equations below. As the velocity increases toward the speed of light c, the denominator of the right side approaches zero, and consequently



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
approaches infinity.
In the formula for momentum





p

=

m

rel



v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m_{\text{rel}}\mathbf {v} }

the mass that occurs is the relativistic mass. In other words, the relativistic mass is the proportionality constant between the velocity and the momentum.
While Newton's second law remains valid in the form





f

=



d
(

m

rel



v

)


d
t



,



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} ={\frac {d(m_{\text{rel}}\mathbf {v} )}{dt}},\!}

the derived form




f

=

m

rel



a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =m_{\text{rel}}\mathbf {a} }
is not valid because




m

rel





{\displaystyle m_{\text{rel}}\,}
in




d
(

m

rel



v

)




{\displaystyle {d(m_{\text{rel}}\mathbf {v} )}\!}
is generally not a constant (see the section above on transverse and longitudinal mass).
Even though Einstein initially used the expressions "longitudinal" and "transverse" mass in two papers (see previous section), in his first paper on



E
=
m

c

2




{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
(1905) he treated m as what would now be called the rest mass. Einstein never derived an equation for "relativistic mass", and in later years he expressed his dislike of the idea:

It is not good to introduce the concept of the mass



M

m

{\displaystyle M=m/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}
of a moving body for which no clear definition can be given. It is better to introduce no other mass concept than the ’rest mass’ m. Instead of introducing M it is better to mention the expression for the momentum and energy of a body in motion.
