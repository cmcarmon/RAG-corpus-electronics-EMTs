Another technique for reducing complex Boolean 
expressions is Karnaughâ€‚ maps, which Maurice 
 Karnaugh developed in 1953. His technique is similar 
to using Veitch diagrams. Figure 43-2 shows several 
Karnaugh maps. It can be cumbersome to solve prob-
lems with five or six variables with either Veitch dia-
grams or Karnaugh maps. Those types of problems are 
best solved by other techniques or computer software 
designed specifically for them.
