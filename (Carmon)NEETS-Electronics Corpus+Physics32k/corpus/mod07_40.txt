Since the invention of the transistor, solid-state devices have been developed and improved at an
unbelievable rate. Great strides have been made in the manufacturing techniques, and there is no
foreseeable limit to the future of these devices. Solid-state devices made from semiconductor materials
offer compactness, efficiency, ruggedness, and versatility. Consequently, these devices have invaded
virtually every field of science and industry. In addition to the junction diode and transistor, a whole new
family of related devices has been developed: the ZENER DIODE, LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE, FIELD
EFFECT TRANSISTOR, etc. One development that has dominated solid-state technology, and probably
has had a greater impact on the electronics industry than either the electron tube or transistor, is the
INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. The integrated circuit is a minute piece of semiconductor material that can
produce complete electronic circuit functions.
