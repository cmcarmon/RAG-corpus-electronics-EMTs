 1, which is across C7, will lag current by 90 degrees. E 1 is applied to the
control grid of reactance tube V1. This changes plate current (Ip), which essentially flows only through
the LC tank circuit. This is because the value of R1 is high compared to the impedance of the tank circuit.
Since current is inversely proportional to impedance, most of the plate current coupled through C3 flows
through the tank circuit.
