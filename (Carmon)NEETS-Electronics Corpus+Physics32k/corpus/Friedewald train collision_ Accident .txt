At 17:45 local time, two passenger trains were involved in a head-on collision on the single track at between Friedewald Haltepunkt and Friedewald Bad stations of the Moritzburg municipality, approximately halfway between the streets Karlstra√üe and An der Siedlung. The train hauled by No. 99 1789-9 was on a regular scheduled service train while that hauled by No. 20 was one of the extra gala trains. Around 250 passengers were travelling on the two trains. Both trains were travelling at a speed of about 25 kilometres per hour (16 mph), and entered a single-tracked long turn in a narrow, forested valley from opposite directions. The drivers were able to notice one another's trains only at short distance, and while both drivers promptly started braking, the trains collided with a speed of 20 kilometres per hour (12 mph). Five carriages derailed.
As a result of the accident, all trains on the line were cancelled, as was the rest of the gala. Ambulances and a helicopter were used to ferry the injured passengers to hospital. Buses were laid on to replace the train service. Work began on 13 September to remove the damaged trains. The line was closed until 15 September and re-opened on early 16 September.
