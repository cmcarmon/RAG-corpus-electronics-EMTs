The effective volume of a cluster is considered much larger than the volume of the particles due to the lower packing fraction of the cluster. Since, heat can be transferred rapidly within the such clusters, the volume fraction of the highly conductive phase is larger than the volume of solid, thus increasing its thermal conductivity
