Electromagnetic  propagators  are  derived  from  a  particular  solution  of  Maxwell’s  equations,  as  the  cause
mentioned above normally involves some speciﬁed or known excitation whose effect is to induce some to-be-
determined response (e.g., a radar cross section, antenna radiation pattern). It therefore follows that the essence
of  electromagnetics  is  the  study  and  determination  of  ﬁeld  propagators  to  thereby  obtain  an  input–output
transfer function for the problem of interest, and it follows that this is also the goal of CEM.
