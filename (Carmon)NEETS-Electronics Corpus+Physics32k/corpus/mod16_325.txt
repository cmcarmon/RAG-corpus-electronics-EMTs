A shunt having exactly the same current rating as the expected normal load current should never be
selected. If you were to select such a shunt, higher than normal load currents could possibly drive the
pointer off scale and damage the meter movement. A good choice of shunt values will place the indicating
needle somewhere near the midscale indication when the load current you are reading is normal. For
example, assume that the meter scale is divided into 100 equal divisions and you want to measure a
current of 60 amperes. The shunt to use would be a 100-ampere shunt. This would make each division of
the scale equal to 1 ampere. The meter indication would fall on the 60th division showing that 60 amperes
of load current is flowing. Therefore, an allowance (40 amperes) remains for unexpected surge currents.
