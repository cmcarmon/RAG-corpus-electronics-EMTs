The  breakdown  strength  of  gases  is  little  affected  with  increasing  frequency  until  the  period  of  the  wave
becomes  comparable  to  the  transit  time  of  the  ions  and,  Ô¨Ånally,  electrons  across  the  gap.  At  this  point  a
substantial reduction in the breakdown strength is observed.
