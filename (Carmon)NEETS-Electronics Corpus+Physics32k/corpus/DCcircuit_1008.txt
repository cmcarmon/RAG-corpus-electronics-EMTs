There are three nodes to write equations for by inspection. Note that the coefﬁcients are
positive for equation (1) E1, equation (2) E2, and equation (3) E3. These are the sums of all
conductances connected to the nodes. All other coefﬁcients are negative, representing a con-
ductance between nodes. The right hand side of the equations is the associated current source,
0.136092 A for the only current source at node 1. The other equations are zero on the right
hand side for lack of current sources. We are too lazy to calculate the conductances for the
resistors on the diagram. Thus, the subscripted G’s are the coefﬁcients.
