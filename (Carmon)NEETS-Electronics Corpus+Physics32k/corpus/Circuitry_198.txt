where  Z  is  the  impedance  (in  Ohms),  X is  the 
reactance, either capacitive or inductive (expressed 
in  ohms),  R is  the  resistance  (in  Ohms),  and    ø is 
the phase angle in radians. 
 
Example 4.11 
 
A 2 µF  capacitor  is  connected  in  series  with  a  
100 F resistor across a 115 V 400 Hz a.c. supply.  
Determine  the  impedance  of  the  circuit  and  the 
current taken from the supply.
