According  to  Fig.  66.7,  each  copper  segment  comes  into  contact
with  one  brush  half  of  the  time  during  each  rotor  revolution.  The
placement  of  the  (stationary)  brushes  guarantees  that  one  brush
always  has  positive  potential  relative  to  the  other.  For  the  chosen
direction  of  rotation,  the  brush  with  higher  potential  is  the  one
directly beneath the N-pole. (Should the rotor rotate in the reverse
direction,  the  opposite  is  true.)  Thus,  the  brushes  can  serve  as  the
terminals of the dc source. In electric machinery, the rectifying action
of the copper segments and brushes is referred to as commutation,
and the machine is called a commutating machine.
