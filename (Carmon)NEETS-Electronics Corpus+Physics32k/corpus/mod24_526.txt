Figure 5-10 (method B) illustrates a far-field spacial scan of the fiber-end face by a movable (planar)
detector. In a far-field spacial scan, lens L1 performs a Fourier transform of the fiber output near-field
pattern. A second lens, L2, is positioned to magnify and relay the transformed image to the detector plane.
The image is scanned in a plane by a movable detector. The scan position y in the Fourier transform plane
is proportional to the far-field scan angle Ã¿. A record of the far-field power distribution is kept as a
function of the far-field scan angle.
