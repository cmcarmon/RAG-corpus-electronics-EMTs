In 2005 several Katyusha rockets were fired from within Jordan. Some hit near the Eilat airport and two hit very close to two United States Navy ships docked in Aqaba, USS Kearsarge, a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship, and USS Ashland, a Whidbey Island-class dock landing ship. The self-styled Abdullah Azzam Brigades claimed responsibility. One of the rockets hit a Jordanian military hospital, killing a Jordanian soldier. The attack is regarded as having been perpetrated by the al-Zarqawi branch of Al Qaeda. > This was the most serious attack on American targets in Jordan since the 2002 killing of American diplomat Laurence Foley in Amman.
