Again, positive energy corresponds to consumed energy and negative energy corresponds to energy produc-
tion. Note that a circuit element having a power proÔ¨Åle that is both positive and negative over some time
interval could consume or produce energy according to the sign of the integral of power. The units of energy
are joules since a watt equals joules/second.
