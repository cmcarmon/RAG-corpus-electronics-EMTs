Let us now illustrate the different interpretations of KCL with the help
of Figure 2.6. Which interpretation you use depends upon convenience and
the specific circuit you are trying to analyze. Figure 2.6 shows a node joining
N branches. Each of the branches contains some two-terminal element, the
specifics of which are not relevant to our discussion. Note that all branch cur-
rents are defined to be positive into the node. Since KCL states that no net
