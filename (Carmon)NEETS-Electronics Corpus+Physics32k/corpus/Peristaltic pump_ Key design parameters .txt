The ideal peristaltic pump should have an infinite diameter of the pump head and the largest possible diameter of the rollers. Such an ideal peristaltic pump would offer the longest possible tubing lifetime and provide a constant and pulsation-free flow rate.
Such an ideal peristaltic pump can not be constructed in reality. However, peristaltic pumps can be designed to approach these ideal peristaltic pump parameters. One example of a possible construction is depicted. The exceptional design of the few peristaltic pumps offer constant accurate flow rates for several weeks together with a long tubing lifetime without the risk of tubing rupture.
