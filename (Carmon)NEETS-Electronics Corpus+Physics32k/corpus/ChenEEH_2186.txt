is a useful alternative form to equation 1.96, especially for
ﬁlamentary currents.
If i ¼ j, Lii( ¼ L) is called a self-inductance, whereas if i 6¼ j,
Lij is called a mutual inductance. A list of self-inductances
for a few selected geometries is shown in Table 1.6. Inductance
will not depend on current if the inductor is constructed from
linear materials. Conversely, if ferromagnetic materials are used
to fabricate the inductor, the inductance may be dependent on
current since, as discussed previously, ferromagnetic materials
can behave nonlinearly.
