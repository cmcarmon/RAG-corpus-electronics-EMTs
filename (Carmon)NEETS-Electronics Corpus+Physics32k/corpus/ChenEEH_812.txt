Passing of parameter values is accomplished by means of the
‘‘generic’’ mechanism of the entity declaration. There is one
terminal port for the nature Thermal and two terminal ports
for the nature Electrical. The associated branch quantities are
deﬁned in the architectural body. In addition, the two free
quantities Q and VT are deﬁned as well. The ﬁrst three simul-
taneous equations denote the electrical behavior of the non-
linear diode. Note the differential equation relating the charge
Q to the current IC. The thermal voltage is now determined by
means of the constants Boltzmann and ElemCharge taken
