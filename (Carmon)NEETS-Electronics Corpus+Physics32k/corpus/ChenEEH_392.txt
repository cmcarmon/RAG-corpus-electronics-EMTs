T2 in equation 4.12b, it becomes apparent that an arbitrary set
of numerator coefﬁcients can be realized by the Ackerberg-
Mossberg circuit. For example, a notch ﬁlter with a transmis-
sion zero on the jv axis requires that a ¼ bkQ by equation
4.16. Notice that the general conﬁguration with the summer is
not required for low-pass and band-pass functions: a low-pass
function is obtained directly at the output VL and a band-pass
at VB as we saw in equations 4.9a and 4.9b.
