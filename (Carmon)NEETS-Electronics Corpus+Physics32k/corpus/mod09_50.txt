As shown in the equation, any increase in frequency, or "f," will cause a corresponding increase of 
inductive reactance, or "XL." Therefore, the INDUCTIVE REACTANCE VARIES DIRECTLY WITH 
THE FREQUENCY. As you can see, the higher the frequency, the greater the inductive reactance; the 
lower the frequency, the less the inductive reactance for a given inductor. This relationship is illustrated in 
figure 1-2. Increasing values of XL are plotted in terms of increasing frequency. Starting at the lower left 
corner with zero frequency, the inductive reactance is zero. As the frequency is increased (reading to the 
right), the inductive reactance is shown to increase in direct proportion.
