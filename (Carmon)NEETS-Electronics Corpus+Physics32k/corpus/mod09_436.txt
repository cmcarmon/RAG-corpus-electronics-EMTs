If the trigger frequency is made slightly higher than the free-running frequency, the blocking 
oscillator will "lock in" at the higher frequency. For instance, assume the free-running frequency of this 
blocking oscillator is 2 kilohertz, with a prt of 500 microseconds. If sync pulses with a prt of 400 
microseconds, or 2.5 kilohertz, are applied to the base, the blocking oscillator will "lock in" and run at 2.5 
kilohertz. If the sync prf is too high, however, frequency division will occur. This means that if the sync
