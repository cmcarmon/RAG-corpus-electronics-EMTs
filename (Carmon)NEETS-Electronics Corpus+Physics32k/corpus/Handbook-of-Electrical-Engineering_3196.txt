Double-Ended Resonant Converters. These converters [Sum, 1988; Bhat, 1991; Steigerwald, 1988; Bhat, 1992]
use full-wave rectiﬁers at the output, and they are generally referred to as resonant converters. A number of
resonant converter conﬁgurations are realizable by using different resonant tank circuits, and the three most
popular  conﬁgurations,  namely,  the  series  resonant  converter  (SRC),  the  parallel  resonant  converter  (PRC),
and the series-parallel resonant converter (SPRC) (also called LCC-type PRC), are shown in Fig. 30.32.
