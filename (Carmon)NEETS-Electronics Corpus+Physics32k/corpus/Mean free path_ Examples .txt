The mean free path is used in the design of chemical apparatus, e.g., systems for distillation. The sizes of atoms and molecules can be estimated from their mean free path. MFP can be used to estimate the resistivity of a material from the mean free path of its electrons.
In aerodynamics, the mean free path has the same order of magnitude as the shockwave thickness at Mach numbers greater than one.
