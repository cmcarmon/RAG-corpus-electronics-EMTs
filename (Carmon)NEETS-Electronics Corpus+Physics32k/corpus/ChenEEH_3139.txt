The demand for energy use is largely driven by increased
urbanization. It is estimated that for a 2-fold increase in the
energy use (usually expressed in terms of GWH or TWH), the
transmission line capacity will increased by about 50%. This
manifests either as an upgrade in the voltage or as new line
construction.
