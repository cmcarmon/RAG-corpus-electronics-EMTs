But, since we don’t know the voltage across R1 (only the total voltage supplied by the battery
across the three-resistor series combination) and we don’t know the current through R1, we
can’t do any calculations with either formula. The same goes for R2 and R3: we can apply the
Ohm’s Law equations if and only if all terms are representative of their respective quantities
between the same two points in the circuit.
