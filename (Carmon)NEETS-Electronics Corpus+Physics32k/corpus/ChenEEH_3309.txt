network admittance equations Y bus V bus ¼ I bus. The matrix
Y bus takes over the role of the matrix A in the linear equations.
We will be solving for the bus voltage vector V bus. The current
injections I bus are not known per se. The current injections are
in fact dependent on the bus voltages. As we see next, they can
also be computed iteratively from the power injections Si by
using the relationship Ii ¼ Si
. For a PQ bus, the injection
Si is a speciﬁed variable and, hence, is known. For PV busses,
only the real power injection Pi is known, while the reactive
injection Qi is evaluated ﬁrst using the latest estimate of bus
voltages V bus.
