Equations 5.3, 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7 show that all power consump-
tion components (static, short circuit, and dynamic) linearly
depend on the supply voltage level, Vdd, except the dynamic
power component. The dynamic power component is not only
in quadratic relation with Vdd, but it is also the dominant
component of the total power dissipation. As such, scaling
down the supply voltage has a profound effect in reducing
the total power dissipation of the whole circuit in hand (Chang
and Pedram, 1997; Wei et al., 2000). Indeed, reducing the
supply voltage is the key to low-power operation, even after
taking into account the modiÔ¨Åcations to the system architec-
ture, which is
required to maintain the computational
throughput (Chandraksan et al., 1992). Once applied, scaling
down will result in power saving that has a global effect,
