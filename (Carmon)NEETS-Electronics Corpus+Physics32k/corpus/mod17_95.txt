One of the prominent features of high-frequency, long-distance communications is the variable 
nature of the propagation medium. (You studied this in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave 
Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas). Successful transmission of hf signals over a long 
distance is dependent upon refraction of radio waves by layers of the ionosphere. The height and density 
of these layers is formed mainly by ultraviolet radiation from the sun. They vary significantly with the 
time of day, season of the year, and the eleven-year cycle of sunspot activity. Because of these variations, 
you must generally use more than a single frequency, sometimes up to four or five, to maintain 
communications on a circuit.
