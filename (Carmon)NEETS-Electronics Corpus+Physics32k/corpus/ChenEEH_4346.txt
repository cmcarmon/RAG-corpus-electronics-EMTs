The same function can be used to solve the generalized
eigenvector problem in the case where not all eigenvalues
are distinct. Eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues
are linearly independent; however, eigenvectors associated with
repeated eigenvalues may be linearly dependent. The general-
ized eigenvector problem produces linearly independent eigen-
vectors by recognizing one can be rather clever in eigenvector
choice. The result is that the non-uniqueness of eigenvectors
can be used as an advantage. Complete eigenstructure assign-
ment can be approached through the feedback control prob-
lem, which has been applied, for example, in active control
of structures.
