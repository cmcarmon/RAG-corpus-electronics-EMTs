A practical inductor may have considerable resistance in the wire of a coil, and sizable
capacitances may exist between various turns. A possible model for a practical inductor could
be a combination of ideal elements: a combination of resistance and inductance in series, with a
capacitance in parallel. Techniques for modeling real circuit elements will be used extensively in
later chapters.
