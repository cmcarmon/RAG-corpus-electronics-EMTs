continuously at the rate at which they are sampled. If the
data does not arrive in time, the playback process will stop,
and human ears and eyes can easily pick up the artifact. In
Internet telephony, human beings can tolerate a latency of
 200 msec. If the latency exceeds this limit, the voice will
sound like a call routed over a long satellite link, which
amounts to degradation in quality of the call. Thus real-time
trafÔ¨Åc enforces strict bounds on end-to-end packet delay (time
taken by the packet to travel from the source to the desti-
nation) and jitter (variability in the interpacket delay at the
receiver). The performance of distributed multimedia applica-
tions improves with decrease in both these quantities.
