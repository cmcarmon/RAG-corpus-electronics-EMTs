It should be remembered that all parameters a, b, g, a, z, and
AR as well as the unit vectors ^uu0 and ^ff0
in equations 6.40 to
6.43 are functions of (u, f). Figure 6.4 shows a four-quadrant
chart for Df that may be used to determine the type of
polarization (linear, circular or elliptical,
left-handed or
right-handed) and the corresponding tilt angle g. The other
parameters a, b, AR, and a can then be determined from cases
A through D as appropriate.
