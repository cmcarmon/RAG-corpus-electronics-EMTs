Angular velocity is the change in angular displacement per unit time. The symbol for angular velocity is



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
and the units are typically rad s−1. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.

{\displaystyle {\overline {\omega }}={\frac {\Delta \theta }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}}.}

The instantaneous angular velocity is given by

{\displaystyle \omega (t)={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}.}

Using the formula for angular position and letting

{\displaystyle v={\frac {ds}{dt}}}
