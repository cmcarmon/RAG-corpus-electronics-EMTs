Interchange instability plays a major role in the radial transport of plasma in the Io plasma torus at Jupiter. The first evidence of this behavior was published in Thorne et al. [1997] in which they discovered “anomalous plasma signatures” in the Io torus of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Using the data from Galileo’s energetic particle detector (EPD), the study looked at one specific event. In Thorne et al. they concluded that these events had a density differential of at least a factor of 2, a spatial scale of km and an inward velocity of about km/s. These results support the theoretical arguments for interchange transport. Later, more injections events were discovered and analyzed from Galileo. Mauk et al. [1999] used over 100 Jovian injections to study how these events were dispersed in energy and time. Similar to injections of Earth, the events were often clustered in time. The authors concluded that this indicated the injection events were triggered by solar wind activity against the Jovian magnetosphere. This is very similar to the magnetic storm relationship injection events have on Earth. However, it was found that Jovian injections can occur at all local time positions and therefore can’t be directly related to the situation in Earth’s magnetosphere. Although the Jovian injections aren’t a direct analog of Earth’s injections, the similarities indicate that this process plays a vital role in the storage and release of energy. The difference may lie in the presence of Io in the Jovian system. Io is a large producer of plasma mass because of its volcanic activity. This explains why the bulk of interchange motions are seen in a small radial range near Io.
