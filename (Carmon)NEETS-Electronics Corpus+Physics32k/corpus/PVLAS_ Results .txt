PVLAS investigated vacuum polarization induced by external magnetic fields. An observation of the rotation of light polarization by the vacuum in a magnetic field was published in 2006. Data taken with an upgraded setup excluded the previous magnetic rotation in 2008 and set limits on photon-photon scattering. An improved limit on nonlinear vacuum effects was set in 2012: Ae < 2.9·10−21 T−2 @ 95% C.L.
