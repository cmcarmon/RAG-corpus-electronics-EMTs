You should notice that when the voltage was increased to 2 volts, the power increased from .5 watts
to 2 watts or 4 times. When the voltage increased to 3 volts, the power increased to 4.5 watts or 9 times.
This shows that if the resistance in a circuit is held constant, the power varies directly with the SQUARE
OF THE VOLTAGE.
