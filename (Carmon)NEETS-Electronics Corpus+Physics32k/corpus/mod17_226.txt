receiver. C1 and R1 form an input signal coupling circuit and are also the means of controlling the level
applied to the audio amplifier. R1, R2, and R3 develop forward bias and set the operating point for the
transistor amplifier. R4 is the collector load resistor for Q1, and C3 is the output coupling capacitor.
Potentiometer R1 in the circuit shown causes the input impedance of the stage to remain fairly constant.
The signal from the preceding stage is felt across R1. By adjusting R1, you can change the input level to
Q1 and vary the output amplitude.
