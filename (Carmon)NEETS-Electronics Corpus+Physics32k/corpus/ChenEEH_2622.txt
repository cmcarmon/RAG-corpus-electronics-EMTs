Equation 7.23 indicates that signal ﬂow can occur from ports
1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1, but ﬂow cannot occur in the reverse
direction. The opposite path may be obtained by changing the
polarity of
the ferrite bias ﬁeld. In practice, permanent
magnets are used to generate the bias ﬁeld. A circulator may
also be used as an isolator by terminating one of its ports with
a matched load. Design and performance speciﬁcations in-
clude required insertion loss, isolation, power handling cap-
ability, and bandwidth.
