The alternate representation discussed for the case of complex poles may also be extended
for multiple poles by combining the terms in Equation (3.3.23) corresponding to the multiple root.
In an expansion of a quotient of polynomials by partial fractions, it may, in general, be necessary
to use a combination of the rules given.
