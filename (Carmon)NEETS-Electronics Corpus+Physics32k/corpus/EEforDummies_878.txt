▶✓ Soldering iron: A soldering iron, 
also called a soldering pencil, is 
a wand‐like tool that consists of 
an insulating handle, a heating 
element, and a polished metal 
tip. (See Figure 13-2.) Choose a 
soldering iron that is rated at 
25–30 watts, sports a replace-
able tip, and has a three‐prong 
plug so that it will be grounded. 
Some models allow you to use 
different size tips for different 
types of projects, and some 
include variable controls that 
allow you to change the wattage. 
(Both are nice but not absolutely 
 necessary.)
