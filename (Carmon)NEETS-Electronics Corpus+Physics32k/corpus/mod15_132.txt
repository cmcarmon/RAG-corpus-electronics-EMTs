It should be clear to you from our discussion of torque synchro systems that, since they produce a 
relatively small mechanical output, they are suitable only for very light loads. Even when the torque 
system is moderately loaded, it is never entirely accurate because the receiver rotor requires a slight 
amount of torque to overcome its static friction.
