The forces acting between atoms can be obtained by differentiation of the total energy with respect to atom positions. That is, to get the force on atom i one should take the three-dimensional derivative (gradient) with respect to the position of atom i:

i

r

T




{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{i}=-\nabla _{{\vec {r}}_{i}}V_{TOT}}


For two-body potentials this gradient reduces, thanks to the symmetry with respect to ij in the potential form, to straightforward differentiation with respect to the interatomic distances





r

i
j





{\displaystyle \textstyle r_{ij}}
. However, for many-body potentials (three-body, four-body, etc.) the differentiation becomes considerably more complex   since the potential may not be any longer symmetric with respect to ij exchange. In other words, also the energy of atoms k that are not direct neighbours of i can depend on the position








r
→




i





{\displaystyle \textstyle {\vec {r}}_{i}}
because of angular and other many-body terms, and hence contribute to the gradient
