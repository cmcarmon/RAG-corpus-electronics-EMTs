Constant  Extinction  Angle  Control.  At  point  D,  the  inverter  ﬁring  angle  has  increased  to  a  point  where
further  increase  can  cause  commutation  failure.  The  inverter  for  its  safe  operation  must  be  operated  with
sufﬁcient angle of advance b, such that under all operating conditions the extinction angle g is greater than the
valve deionization angle. The deionization angle is deﬁned as the time in electrical degrees from the instant
current reaches zero in a particular valve to the time the valve can withstand the application of positive voltage.
