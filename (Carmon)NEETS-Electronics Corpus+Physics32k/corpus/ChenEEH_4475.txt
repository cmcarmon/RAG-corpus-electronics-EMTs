Cost-cumulant control, also known as statistical control, is an
optimal control method that minimizes a linear combination
of quadratic cost cumulants. Risk-sensitive control is an opti-
mal control method that minimizes the exponential of the
quadratic cost criterion. This is equivalent to optimizing a
denumerable sum of all the cost cumulants.
