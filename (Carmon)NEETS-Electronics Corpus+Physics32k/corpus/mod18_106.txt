A duplexer is essentially an electronic switch that permits a radar system to use a single antenna to
both transmit and receive. The duplexer must connect the antenna to the transmitter and disconnect the
antenna from the receiver for the duration of the transmitted pulse. The receiver must be completely
isolated from the transmitted pulse to avoid damage to the extremely sensitive receiver input circuitry.
After the transmitter pulse has ended, the duplexer must rapidly disconnect the transmitter and connect
the receiver to the antenna. As previously mentioned, the switching time is called receiver recovery time,
and must be very fast if close-in targets are to be detected. Additionally, the duplexer should absorb very
little power during either phase of operation. Low-loss characteristics are particularly important during
the receive period of duplexer operation. This is because the received signals are of extremely low
amplitude.
