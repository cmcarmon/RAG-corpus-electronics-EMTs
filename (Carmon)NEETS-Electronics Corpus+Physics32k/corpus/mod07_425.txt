In filter circuits the capacitor is the common element to both the charge and the discharge paths. 
Therefore, to obtain the longest possible discharge time, you want the capacitor to be as large as possible. 
Another way to look at it is: The capacitor acts as a short circuit around the load (as far as the ac 
component is concerned), and since
