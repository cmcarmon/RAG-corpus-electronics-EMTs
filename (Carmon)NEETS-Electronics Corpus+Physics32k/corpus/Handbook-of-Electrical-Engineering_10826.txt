These  tools  will  need  to  be  based  on  life  cycle  assessment,  the  objective  process  used  to  evaluate  the
environmental  impacts  associated  with  a  product  and  identify  opportunities  for  improvement.  Life  cycle
assessment  seeks  to  minimize  the  environmental  impact  of  the  manufacture,  use,  and  eventual  disposal  of
products without compromising essential product functions. Figure 111.3 shows the life stages that would be
considered for electronic products (i.e., the life cycle considered has been bounded by product design activities).
The ability of the electronics industry to operate in a more environmentally and economically efﬁcient mode,
use less chemicals and materials, and reduce energy consumption will require support tools that can be used
to evaluate both product and process designs. To date, many ﬁrms are making immediate gains by incorporating
basic tools like DFE checklists, design standards and internal databases on chemicals and materials, while other
ﬁrms are developing sophisticated software tools that give products environmental scores based on the product’s
compliance with a set of predetermined environmental attributes. These software tools rely heavily on envi-
ronmental metrics (typically internal to the ﬁrm) to assess the environmental impact and then assign a score
to the associated impact.
