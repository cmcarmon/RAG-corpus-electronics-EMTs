I 2t represents heat energy measured in units of A2 s (ampere squared seconds) and is documented on  I 2t
graphs. These I 2t graphs, as illustrated in Fig. 1.34(c), provide three values of I 2t: minimum melting I 2t, arcing
I 2t, and total clearing  I 2t.  I 2t and Ip short-circuit performance characteristics can be used to coordinate fuses
and other equipment. In particular,  I 2t values are often used to selectively coordinate fuses in a distribution
system.
