If your work area must be exposed to other family members, find ways to 
make the area off‐limits to others with less knowledge about electronics 
safety (which I cover later in this chapter), especially young children. Keep 
your projects, tools, and supplies out of reach or behind locked doors. And 
be sure to keep integrated circuits and other sharp parts off the floor — 
they’re painful when stepped on!
