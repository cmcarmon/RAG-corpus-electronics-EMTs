The windings of a Gramme-ring armature are placed on an iron ring. A disadvantage of this 
arrangement is that the windings located on the inner side of the iron ring cut few lines of flux. Therefore, 
they have little, if any, voltage induced in them. For this reason, the Gramme-ring armature is not widely 
used.
