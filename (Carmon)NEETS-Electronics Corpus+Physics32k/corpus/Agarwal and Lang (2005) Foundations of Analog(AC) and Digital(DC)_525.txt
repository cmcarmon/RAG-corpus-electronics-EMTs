Notice that the 1-A current flows through each of the 1- resistors in the loop containing
the current source, and so v1 is 1 V. Since there is no current in the resistor connected
terminal, the voltage v2 across that resistor is 0. Thus vTHA = v1 + v2 = 1 V.

We find RTHA by measuring the resistance looking into the aa
port in the network in
Figure 3.68c. The current source has been turned into an open circuit for the purpose
