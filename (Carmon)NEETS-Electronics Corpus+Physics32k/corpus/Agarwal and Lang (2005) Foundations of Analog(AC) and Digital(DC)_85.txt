obey Ohmâ€™s law.5 The circuit comprising a set of lumped elements must also
have a voltage defined between any pair of points, and a current defined into
any terminal. Furthermore, the elements must not interact with each other
except through their terminal currents and voltages. That is, the internal physical
phenomena that make an element function must interact with external electrical
phenomena only at the electrical terminals of that element. As we will see in
Section 1.3, lumped elements and the circuits formed using these elements must
adhere to a set of constraints for these definitions and terminal interactions to
exist. We name this set of constraints the lumped matter discipline.
