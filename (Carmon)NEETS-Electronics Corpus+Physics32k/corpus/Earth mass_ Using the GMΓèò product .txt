Modern methods of determining the mass of Earth involve calculating the gravitational coefficient of the Earth and dividing by the Newtonian constant of gravitation,

The GM⊕ product for the Earth is called the geocentric gravitational constant and equals 398600.4418±0.0008 km3 s−2. It is determined using laser ranging data from Earth-orbiting satellites, such as LAGEOS-1. The GM⊕ product can also be calculated by observing the motion of the Moon or the period of a pendulum at various elevations. These methods are less precise than observations of artificial satellites.
The uncertainty of the geocentric gravitational constant is just 1 to 500000000, however, M⊕ (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) can be found out only by dividing the GM⊕ product by G, and G is known only to an uncertainty of 1 to 7000, so M⊕ will have the same uncertainty. For this reason and others, astronomers prefer to use the un-reduced GM⊕ product rather than mass in kilograms when referencing and comparing planetary objects.
