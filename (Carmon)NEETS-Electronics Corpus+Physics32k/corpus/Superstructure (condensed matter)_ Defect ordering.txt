Many alloys of elements that resemble each other chemically will form a structure at higher temperatures where the two elements occupy similar positions in the lattice at random. At lower temperatures ordering may occur where crystallographic positions are no longer equivalent because the one element preferentially occupies one and the other the other. This process may lower the translation symmetry and result in a different, larger unit cell.
