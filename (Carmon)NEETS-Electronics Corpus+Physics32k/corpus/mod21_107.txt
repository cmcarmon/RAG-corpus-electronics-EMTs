The Maxwell bridge, shown in view C of figure 1-14, measures inductance by comparing it with a
capacitance and (effectively) two resistances.] This bridge circuit is employed for measuring inductances
having losses greater than 0.05 (expressed by the D dial reading). For such inductors it is necessary to
introduce, in place of the series control (D dial), a new loss control (Q dial), which shunts the standard
capacitor. This control, which becomes effective when the FUNCTION switch is turned to the L(Q)
position, is conveniently calibrated in values of Q, the storage factor of the inductor under measurement.
The balance for inductance is the same for either bridge circuit. This permits the use of the same markings
on the RANGE switch for both the L(D) and L(Q) positions of the FUNCTION switch.
