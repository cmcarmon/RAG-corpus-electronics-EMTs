Edge triggered SRFF symbols are illustrated in Figure 6.1.19. The triangle on the Ck (clock)
input indicates that the ﬂip-ﬂop is triggered on the edge of a clock pulse. Positive-edge triggering
is shown in Figure 6.1.19(a). Negative-edge triggering is indicated by the ring on the Ck input in
Figure 6.1.19(b).
