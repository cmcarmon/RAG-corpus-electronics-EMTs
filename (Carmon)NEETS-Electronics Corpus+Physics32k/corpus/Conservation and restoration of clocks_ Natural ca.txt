a. Humidity and temperature
The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. “[...] extremes in temperature and humidity”  can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near "a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements."
b. Pests
Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:
Carpet beetle- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such “[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.”
Powderpost beetle- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.

c. Light
Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached. Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration “[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or “alligatored” appearance.”
d. Contaminants

Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:
Dust is one such contaminant which settles on a clock’s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion.
Oil is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.
