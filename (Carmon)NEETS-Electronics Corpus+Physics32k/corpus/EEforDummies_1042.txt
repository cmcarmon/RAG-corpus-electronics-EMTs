While you’re buying your breadboard, purchase a set of prestripped jumper 
wires, as I suggest in Chapter 13. (Don’t get cheap now; this purchase is 
worth it.) Prestripped wires come in a variety of lengths and are already 
stripped (obviously) and bent, ready for you to use in breadboards. For 
instance, one popular assortment contains 10 each of 14 wire lengths, rang-
ing from 0.1 inch to 5 inches (see Figure 15–4). A set of 140‐350 prestripped 
wires may cost you $6–$15, but you can bet the price is well worth the time 
you’ll save. The alternative is to buy a bunch of wire, cut segments of vari-
ous lengths, and painstakingly strip about 1/3‐inch of the insulation from 
each end.
