Physical measurands include temperature, strain, force, pressure, displacement, position, velocity, acceleration,
optical radiation, sound, ﬂow rate, viscosity, and electromagnetic ﬁelds. Referring to Table 56.1, all but those
transduction mechanisms listed in the chemical column are used in the design of physical sensors. Clearly, they
comprise a very large proportion of all sensors. It is impossible to illustrate all of them, but three measurands
stand out in terms of their widespread application: temperature, displacement (or associated force), and optical
radiation.
