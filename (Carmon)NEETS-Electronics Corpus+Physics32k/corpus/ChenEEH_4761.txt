According to the analysis performed in Nayfeh et al. (1989),
the wing rock system has a stable focus at the origin for angles
of attack v less than approximately 19.5. For larger angles, the
origin becomes an unstable equilibrium, and a limit cycle
appears around it. In both cases, however, the system is
unstable and may diverge to inÔ¨Ånity if the initial conditions
