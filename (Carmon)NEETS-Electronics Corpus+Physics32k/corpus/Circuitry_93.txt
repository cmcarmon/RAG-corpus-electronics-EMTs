resistance quoted at 25°C). Under fault conditions, 
the  current  exceeds  the  threshold  value  by  a 
considerable  margin  and  the  thermistor  starts  to 
self-heat. The resistance then increases rapidly and, 
as a consequence, the current falls to the rest value. 
Typical  values  of  threshold  and  rest  currents  are 
200 mA and 8 mA, respectively, for a device which 
exhibits a nominal resistance of 25 $ at 25°C.
