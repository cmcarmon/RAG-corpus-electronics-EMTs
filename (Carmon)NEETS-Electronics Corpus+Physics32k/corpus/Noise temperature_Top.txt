In electronics, noise temperature is one way of expressing the level of available noise power introduced by a component or source. The power spectral density of the noise is expressed in terms of the temperature (in kelvins) that would produce that level of Johnson–Nyquist noise, thus:






P
B


=

k

B


T


{\displaystyle {\frac {P}{B}}=k_{B}T}

where:




P


{\displaystyle P}
is the power (in watts)




B


{\displaystyle B}
is the total bandwidth (Hz) over which that noise power is measured





k

B




{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is the Boltzmann constant (1.381×10−23 J/K, joules per kelvin)




T


{\displaystyle T}
is the noise temperature (K)
Thus the noise temperature is proportional to the power spectral density of the noise,



P

/

B


{\displaystyle P/B}
. That is the power that would be absorbed from the component or source by a matched load. Noise temperature is generally a function of frequency, unlike that of an ideal resistor which is simply equal to the actual temperature of the resistor at all frequencies.
