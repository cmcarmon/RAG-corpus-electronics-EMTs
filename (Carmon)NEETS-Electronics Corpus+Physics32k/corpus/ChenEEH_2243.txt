In words: The D ﬁeld can always be interpreted as the sum of
the D ﬁeld that would be assigned to the region if its material
were the same as the external medium (e2 in this case) plus a
polarization term due to the induced dipole moments arising
from the contrast in properties across the boundary of the
region.
