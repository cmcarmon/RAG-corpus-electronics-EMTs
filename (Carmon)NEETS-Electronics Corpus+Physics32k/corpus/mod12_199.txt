As stated earlier, the modulating signal can be introduced into any active element of a tube. In 
addition to the various arrangements possible within a single stage, the modulating signal can also be 
applied to any of the rf stages in the transmitter. For example, the modulating signal could be applied to 
the control grid or plate of one of the intermediate power amplifiers.
