The subject of electrical measurements is such a large one that entire books have been written on
the topic. Only a few basic principles will be introduced here. Practical measurements are made
with real instruments, which in general disturb the operation of a circuit to some extent when they
are connected. Measurements may be affected by noise, which is undesirable randomly varying
signals.
