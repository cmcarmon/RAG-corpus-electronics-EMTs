Reflections occur at optical fiber connections. Optical power may be reflected back into the source
fiber when connecting two optical fibers. In laser-based systems, reflected power reaching the optical
source can reduce system performance by affecting the stability (operation) of the source. In addition,
multiple reflections occur in fiber optic data links containing more than one connection. Multiple
reflections can reduce data link performance by increasing the signal noise present at the optical detector.
