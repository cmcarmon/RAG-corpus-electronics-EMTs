Arrays of Wire Antennas
Often  it  is  advantageous  to  have  several  antennas  operating  together  in  an array.
Arrays of antennas can be made to produce highly directional radiation patterns.
Also, small antennas can be used in an array to obtain the level of performance of
a large antenna at a fraction of the area.
