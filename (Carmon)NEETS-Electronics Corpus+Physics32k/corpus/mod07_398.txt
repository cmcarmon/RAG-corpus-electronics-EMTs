A diagram of a simple full-wave rectifier is shown in figure 4-5. The transformer supplies the source 
voltage for two diode rectifiers, D1 and D2. This power transformer has a center-tapped, high-voltage 
secondary winding that is divided into two equal parts (W1 and W2). W1 provides the source voltage for 
D1, and W2 provides the source voltage for D2. The connections to the diodes are arranged so that the 
diodes conduct on alternate half cycles.
