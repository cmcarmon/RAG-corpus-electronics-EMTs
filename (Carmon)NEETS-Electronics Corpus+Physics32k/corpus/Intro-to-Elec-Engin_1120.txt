As in a transformer, the stator (primary) current can be resolved into two components:
a load component ¯I
(cid:7)
2 (which produces an mmf that exactly counteracts the mmf of the rotor
current) and an excitation component ¯I0 (required to create the resultant air-gap ﬂux). This
excitation component itself can be resolved into a core-loss component ¯Ic in phase with ¯E1
