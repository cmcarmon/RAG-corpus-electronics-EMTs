In some electronics books, and later in this chapter, you will find the term SUBHARMONIC used. It
refers to a sine wave quantity (for example, an oscillator output) that has a frequency that is a submultiple
of the frequency of some other sine wave quantity it helped make. For example, a wave that is half the
fundamental frequency of another wave is called the second subharmonic of that wave; one with a third of
the fundamental frequency is called a third subharmonic; and so forth.
