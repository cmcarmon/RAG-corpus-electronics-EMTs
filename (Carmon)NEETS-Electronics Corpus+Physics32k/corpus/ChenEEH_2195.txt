ent magnetic ﬂux paths, as appropriate, then computing the
reluctances of the paths using equation 1.125. The last two
entries in Table 1.7 list the laws used to solve magnetic circuit
problems. In particular, the sum of mmfs around a closed loop
is equal to the sum of ‘‘reluctance drops’’ (KVL analogy), while
the sum of magnetic ﬂuxes into a junction equals zero (KCL
analogy) (Cheng, 1989; Paul et al., 1998)
