Prior to algorithm-to-hardware synthesis, a system speciÔ¨Å-
cation undergoes HW/SW partitioning. The success of FPGA/
RC lies in how effective the algorithm is mapped to its hard-
ware counterpart and how both hardware and software inter-
act with one another. The latter part, however, is beyond the
scope of this chapter.
