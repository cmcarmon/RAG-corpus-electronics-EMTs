management units (MMUs), the programs can be swopped in and out of the main memory to the auxiliary
memory when required. For the system to keep pace with this program swopping, it must have a fast auxiliary
memory to write to. In the past, most auxiliary systems like magnetic tape and disks have had slow access times,
and this has meant that expensive systems have evolved to cater for this requirement. Now that auxiliary memory
has improved, and access times are fast and the memory cheap, computer systems have been developed that
provide  memory  swopping  with  large  nonvolatile  storage  systems.  Although  the  basic  technology  has  not
changed over the last 20 years, new materials and different approaches have meant that a new form of auxiliary
memory has been brought to the market at a very cheap cost.
