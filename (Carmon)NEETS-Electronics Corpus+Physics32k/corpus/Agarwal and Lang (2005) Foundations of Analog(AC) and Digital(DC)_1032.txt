As a final thought, although our piecewise linear model for the BJT seems a bit com-
plicated at first glance, analog circuits are commonly designed such that BJT always
operates in its active region, and the base-to-collector diode is always OFF.6 We can
achieve the desired effect by ensuring that the base-to-collector voltage never exceeds
0.4 V during normal operation (that is, vBC < 0.4 V, or equivalently, vCE > vBEâˆ’0.4 V).
This assumption will be made in all the BJT circuits in this book, so the collector diode
can be safely ignored. The resulting, simplified BJT model is depicted in Figure 7.52.
