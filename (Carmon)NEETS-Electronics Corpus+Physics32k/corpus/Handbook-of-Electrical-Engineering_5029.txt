Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a common inorganic insulating material, which due to its relatively high thermal
conductivity  is  utilized  for  insulating  heating  elements  in  ovens.  The  resistance  wire  elements  are  placed
concentrically within stainless steel tubes, with magnesium oxide packed around them to provide the insulation.
Electrical-grade glasses consist principally of SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 structures that are relatively open to permit
ionic diffusion and migration. Consequently, glasses tend to be relatively lossy at high temperatures, though
at  low  temperatures  they  are  suitable  for  use  in  overhead  line  insulators  and  in  transformer,  capacitor,  and
circuit breaker bushings. At high temperatures, their main application lies with incandescent and ï¬‚uorescent
lamps as well as electronic tube envelopes.
