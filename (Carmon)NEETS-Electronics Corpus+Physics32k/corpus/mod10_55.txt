In the previous discussion, we listed radio waves, light waves, and heat waves as examples of
transverse waves, but we did not mention sound waves. Why? Simply because sound waves are
LONGITUDINAL WAVES. Unlike transverse waves, which travel at right angles to the direction of
propagation, sound waves travel back and forth in the same direction as the wave motion. Therefore,
longitudinal waves are waves in which the disturbance takes place in the direction of propagation.
Longitudinal waves are sometimes called COMPRESSION WAVES.
