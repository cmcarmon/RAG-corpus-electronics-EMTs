Although the open-circuit voltage of a pn junction solar cell is inﬂuenced by the operating temperature, the
light-generated current and the minority carrier losses, the minority carrier loss term visually dominates since
it  can  change  by  orders  of  magnitude  for  different  solar  cell  designs,  materials,  and  fabrication  processes.
Minority  carriers  can  recombine  in  each  of  the  various  regions  of  the  solar  cell  —  in  the  base,  within  the
junction depletion region, in the emitter, and at either the front or the rear surface. For completeness, it should
be mentioned that recombination at each surface consists of two parts: recombination at the ohmic contact
and recombination at the free surface (if the metallization does not cover the whole surface, such as the front
of the solar cell). In the limiting thick-base case, recombination at the surfaces and within the junction and
emitter of the solar cell will be minimized in comparison to the base recombination term, and minority carrier
losses  will  be  controlled  solely  by  the  minority  carrier  lifetime  in  the  base “bulk”  region.  For  the  thin-base
device, however, base recombination will be reduced with volume, and minority carrier losses will be increas-
ingly inﬂuenced by the surfaces and contacts.
