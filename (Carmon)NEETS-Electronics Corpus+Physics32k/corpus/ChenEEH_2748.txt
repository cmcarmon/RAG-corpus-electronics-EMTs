Relation of the Time and Space Discretizations in Generating
Numerical Velocity Error
In the previous section we determined that D~vvaniso ¼ 0:208%
for a two-dimensional Yee algorithm having Nl ¼ 20 and
S ¼ 0:5. An important and revealing question is how is
D~vvaniso affected by the choice of S, assuming that Nl is ﬁxed
at 20?
