Linearity and shift invariance are often used in combination to
model the behavior of practical systems. This chapter is largely
devoted to developing descriptions and tools for the analysis
and design of linear shift-invariant (LSI) systems. These are
often referred to as linear time-invariant (LTI) systems because
the independent variable is commonly time.
