In summary, a voltage is always defined as the potential difference between
a pair of points
the two branch terminals for a branch voltage, and two nodes
for a node voltage. Accordingly, voltage measurement instruments have two
leads
one to connect to the node in question and one to the reference node
or ground. Thus, when we refer to a node voltage, we are also making implicit
reference to a common ground node.
