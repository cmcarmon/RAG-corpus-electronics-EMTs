(cid:1) The simplest model for the MOSFET is the S model. This switch model
models the on-off behavior of the MOSFET. Accordingly, the S model is
appropriate when the designer cares only about the logical behavior of a
circuit containing MOSFETs; in other words, where the voltage values of
interest are only highs and lows. Thus, the S model is commonly used
to arrive at the topology of a digital circuit to perform some given logical
function. The S model is also useful in certain analog situations where the
specific properties of the MOSFET beyond its on-off behavior have no
effect on circuit behavior. Certain power circuits that use the MOSFET as a
switch fall under this category.
