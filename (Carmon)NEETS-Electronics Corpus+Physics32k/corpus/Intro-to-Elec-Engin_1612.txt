A common symbol for the self-commutated semiconductor switch is shown in Figure 16.1.18.
The control signal (either voltage or current) is denoted by CS, and the diode gives the direction
in which the switch can conduct current. GTOs, power transistors, and MOSFETs are classiÔ¨Åed
as self-commutated semiconductor devices because they can be turned off by their respective
control signals: GTOs by a gate pulse, a power transistor by a base drive, and a MOSFET by
a gate-to-source voltage. A thyristor, on the other hand, is a naturally commutated device that
cannot be turned off by its gate signal. A thyristor combined with a forced commutation circuit
behaves like a self-commutated semiconductor device, however. The self-commutation capability
makes its turnoff independent of the polarity of the source voltage, the load voltage, or the nature
of load. Self-commutated semiconductor switches are suitable for applications for converters fed
from a dc source, such as inverters and choppers.
