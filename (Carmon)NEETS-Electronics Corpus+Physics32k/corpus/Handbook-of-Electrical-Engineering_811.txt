The stability of a system is deÔ¨Åned with respect to a given equilibrium point in state space. If the initial state

the initial state is selected close to an equilibrium state, the system might remain close to the equilibrium state
or it might move away. In this section we introduce conditions that guarantee that whenever the system starts
near an equilibrium state, it remains near it, perhaps even converging to the equilibrium state as time increases.
For simplicity, only time-invariant systems are considered in this section. Time-variant systems are discussed
in Section 12.5.
