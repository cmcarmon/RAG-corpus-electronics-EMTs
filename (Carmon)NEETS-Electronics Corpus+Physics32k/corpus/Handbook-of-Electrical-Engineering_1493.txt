Some of the key engineering challenges in building speech recognition systems are selecting a proper set of
sub-word  units  (e.g.,  phones),  assembling  units  into  words  (baseforms),  modeling  co-articulating  effects,
accomodating the different stress patterns of different languages, and modeling pitch contours for tone-based
languages such as Mandarin.
