One disadvantage of carbon microphones is that of a constant BACKGROUND HISS (hissing noise) 
which results from random changes in the resistance between individual carbon granules. Other 
disadvantages are reduced sensitivity and distortion that may result from the granules packing or sticking 
together. The carbon microphone also has a limited frequency response. Still another disadvantage is a 
requirement for an external voltage source.
