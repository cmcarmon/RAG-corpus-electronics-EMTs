Ohm’s Law 
 
Provided  that  temperature  does  not  vary,  the  ratio 
of p.d. across the ends of a conductor to the current 
flowing  in  the  conductor  is  a  constant.  This 
relationship is known as Ohm’s Law and it leads to 
the relationship: 
 
V / I = a constant = R
where V is the potential difference (or voltage drop) 
in Volts (V), I is the current in Amperes (A), and R
is the resistance in Ohms (<) (see Fig. 1.4). 
  The formula may be arranged to make V, I or R
the subject, as follows:
