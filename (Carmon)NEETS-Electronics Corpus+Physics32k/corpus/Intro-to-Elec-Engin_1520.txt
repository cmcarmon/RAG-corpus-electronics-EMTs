Carrier Modulation by Digital Signals
Digitally modulated signals with low-pass spectral characteristics can be transmitted directly
through baseband channels (having low-pass frequency-response characteristics) without the
need for frequency translation of the signal. However, there are many communication bandpass
channels (telephone, radio, and satellite channels) that pass signals within a band of frequencies
(that is far removed from dc). Digital information may be transmitted through such channels by
using a sinusoidal carrier that is modulated by the information sequence in either amplitude, phase,
or frequency, or some other combination of amplitude and phase. The effect of impressing the in-
formation signal on one or more of the sinusoidal parameters is to shift the frequency content of the
transmitted signal to the appropriate frequency band that is passed by the channel. Thus, the signal
is transmitted by carrier modulation. There are several carrier-modulation methods. However, we
shall limit our discussion to the following, assuming only binary modulation in all cases:
