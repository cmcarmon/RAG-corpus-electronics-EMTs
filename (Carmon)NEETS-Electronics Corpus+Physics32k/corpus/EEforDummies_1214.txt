You can use your multimeter to test voltages, currents, and resistances in 
your circuit. As described in ChapterÂ 16, such tests can help you identify the 
cause of circuit problems. Your multimeter can tell you whether your battery 
has enough juice, whether your diode is still a diode, and much, much more.
