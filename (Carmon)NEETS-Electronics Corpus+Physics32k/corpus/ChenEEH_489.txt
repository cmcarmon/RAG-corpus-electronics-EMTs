CL is the capacitive load at the transistor output and includes
CjS. For small ratios CL=CBC , the simple classical equation
fmax Â¼
is obtained. The typical bias depend-
ence of fT and fmax is shown in Figure 5.11(A). Although fT
shows a moderate dependence on emitter geometry, fmax is a
strong function of the emitter dimensions and is usually evalu-
ated for transistors with lE0  bE0. An important FoM char-
acterizing the noise behavior of a transistor is the noise factor F
