The rotor in the distributor rotates continually (when in use) in one direction and makes a complete
circle. This is not true for all rotary switches. The ignition switch in an automobile is also a rotary switch.
It usually has four positions (accessory, off, on, start). Unlike the rotor, it does not rotate continually
when in use, can be turned in either direction, and does not move through a complete circle.
