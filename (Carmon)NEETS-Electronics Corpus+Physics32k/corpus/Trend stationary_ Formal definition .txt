A process {Y} is said to be trend stationary if





Y

t


=
f
(
t
)
+

e

t


,


{\displaystyle Y_{t}=f(t)+e_{t},}

where t is time, f is any function mapping from the reals to the reals, and {e} is a stationary process. The value



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}
is said to be the trend value of the process at time t.
