Magnetic Resonance Imaging
The  basic  magnetic  resonance  concept  has  been  used  as  a  tool  in
chemistry and physics since its discovery by Bloch in 1946, but its use
expanded tremendously in the 1980s with the development of means
to represent magnetic resonance signals in the form of tomographic
images. Magnetic resonance imaging is based on the magnetic prop-
erties  of  atomic  nuclei  with  odd  numbers  of  protons  or  neutrons,
which exhibit magnetic properties because of their spin. The predom-
inant  source  of  magnetic  resonance  signals  in  the  human  body  is
hydrogen nuclei or protons. In the presence of an external magnetic
ﬁeld, these hydrogen nuclei align along the axis of the ﬁeld and can
precess or wobble around that ﬁeld direction at a deﬁnite frequency
known as the Larmour frequency. This can be expressed:
