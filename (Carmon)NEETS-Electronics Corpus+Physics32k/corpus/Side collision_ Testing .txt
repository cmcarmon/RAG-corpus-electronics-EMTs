Euro NCAP, IIHS and NHTSA test side impacts in different ways. As of 2015, they all test vehicle-to-vehicle side impacts, where heavier vehicles have lower fatality rates than lighter vehicles.
NHTSA and EuroNCAP also test the more severe vehicle-into-pole side impacts, where smaller vehicles have the same fatality rate as larger vehicles.
Newer cars have improved safety of front crashes, but side impacts are also deadly; about 9,700 people were killed in side impacts in the US in 2004. Side airbags became mandatory in 2009 in the USA, saving an estimated 1,000 lives per year.  Research indicates that the vehicle's underbody is the best place to reinforce structures to reduce intrusion by the pole.
