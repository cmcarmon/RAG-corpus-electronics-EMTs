For applications requiring a more extended high-frequency response, there are op amps with no
internal compensation, and external frequency-compensation terminals are provided on these op
amps (for example, the 709) so that the frequency response can be tailored to avoid instability
without the heavy degrading of frequency response due to internal compensation. A typical
frequency-compensation circuit for the ÂµA 709 is illustrated in Figure 5.3.8. Op-amp manufac-
turers supply plots of open- and closed-loop responses for various values of components connected
to the frequency-compensation terminals.
