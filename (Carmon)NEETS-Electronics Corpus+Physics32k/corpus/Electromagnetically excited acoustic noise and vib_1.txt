The harmonic electromagnetic forces responsible for magnetic noise and vibrations in a healthy machine can come from
Pulse-width modulation supply of the machine
slotting effects
magnetic saturation
In a faulty machine, additional noise and vibrations due to electromagnetic forces can come from
mechanical static and dynamic eccentricities
uneven air-gap
demagnetization
short circuits
missing magnetic wedges
Unbalanced Magnetic Pull (UMP) describes the electromagnetic equivalence of mechanical rotating unbalance: if electromagnetic forces are not balanced, a non-zero net magnetic force appears on stator and rotor. This force can excite the bending mode of the rotor and create additional vibration and noise.
