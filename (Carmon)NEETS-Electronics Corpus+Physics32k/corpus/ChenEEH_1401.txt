Hutchings and Wirthlin (1995) have built a dynamic in-
struction set computer (DISC) that emulates a reconﬁgurable
microprocessor by using an FPGA and demonstrates the po-
tential of automatic reconﬁguration using stored conﬁgu-
rations. As a program runs,
the FPGA requests a new
reconﬁguration if the desired instruction is not resident.
DISC allows a designer to create and store a large number of
