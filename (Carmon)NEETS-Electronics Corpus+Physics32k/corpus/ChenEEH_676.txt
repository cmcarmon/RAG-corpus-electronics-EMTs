In addition to the mainstream evolution of these SRAMs,
DRAMs, and SDRAMs, more customized large capacity high
bandwidth memories are proposed that are intended for more
specialized purposes. Examples are video RAMs, very wide
DRAMs, and SRAMs with more than two ports (see the
eight-port SRAM described by Takayanagi et al., 1996, and
review Prince, 1994). See also Figure 2.8.
