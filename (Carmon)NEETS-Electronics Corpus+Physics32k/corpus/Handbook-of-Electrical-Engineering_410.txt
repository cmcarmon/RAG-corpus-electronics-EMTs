The Flowgraph Approach
Mathematically speaking, a linear electrical network or, more generally, a linear system can be described by a
set  of  simultaneous  linear  equations.  Solutions  to  these  equations  can  be  obtained  either  by  the  method  of
successive substitutions (elimination theory), by the method of determinants (Cramer’s rule), or by any of the
topological techniques such as Maxwell’s k-tree approach discussed in the preceding subsection and the ﬂow-
graph techniques represented by the works of Mason [1953, 1956], and Coates [1959].
