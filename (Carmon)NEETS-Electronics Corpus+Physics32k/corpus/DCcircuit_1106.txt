which affects its ability to supply current to the load resistance of 1 Ω. The ideal battery on the
left has no internal resistance, and so our Ohm’s Law calculations for current (I=E/R) give us
a perfect value of 10 amps for current with the 1 ohm load and 10 volt supply. The real battery,
with its built-in resistance further impeding the ﬂow of electrons, can only supply 8.333 amps
to the same resistance load.
