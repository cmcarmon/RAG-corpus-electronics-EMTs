In  a  linear  electrical  network,  the  voltage  or  current  in  any  element  resulting
from several sources acting together is the sum of the voltages or currents from each source acting alone.
In a network consisting of linear, passive impedances, the ratio of the voltage introduced
into any branch to the current in any other branch is equal in magnitude and phase to the ratio that
results if the positions of the voltage and current are interchanged.
