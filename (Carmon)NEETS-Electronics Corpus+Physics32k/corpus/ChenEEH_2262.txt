3 Plane Wave Propagation and Reﬂection
Equations 3.18 and 3.19 each imply that E  H ¼ 0, and to-
gether, they also imply that k  E ¼ 0 and k  H ¼ 0; that is, all
three vectors k, E, and H are mutually orthogonal. Another
interesting property that is true for any plane wave, which may
be derived directly from equations 3.18, or 3.19, is that:
