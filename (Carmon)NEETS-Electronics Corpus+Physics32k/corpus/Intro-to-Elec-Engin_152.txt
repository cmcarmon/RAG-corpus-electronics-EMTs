(2.1.4)
Thus, voc is known as the open-circuit voltage (or Thévenin voltage) with i = 0, and RTh is the
Thévenin equivalent resistance (as seen from the terminals a–b) with voc = 0. Equation (2.1.4)
accounts for the ideal sources present in that linear portion of the circuit, as shown in Figure
2.1.1(a), whereas Equation (2.1.3) implies deactivating or zeroing all ideal sources (i.e., replacing
voltage sources by short circuits and current sources by open circuits). The model with the voltage
source voc in series with RTh is known as Thévenin equivalent circuit, as shown in Figure 2.1.1(b).
