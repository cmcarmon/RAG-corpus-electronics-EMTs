Extensions  of  smart  material  concepts  can  cover  selective  acoustical  absorptions  and  adaptive  chromic
controls in glasses, mirrors, etc. In short, viable smart systems can be conceived with various combinations of
material  characteristics  discussed  earlier  together  with  the  advent  of  new  conventional  materials,  innovative
sensors, advances in microcomputers, artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence, neural networking, and other upcoming technol-
ogies. Currently imaginable outlets for smart materials are summarized in the following list.
