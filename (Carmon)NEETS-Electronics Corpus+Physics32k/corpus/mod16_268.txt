The oscilloscope is also used to picture changes in quantities other than simply the voltages in
electric circuits. For example, if you need to see the changes in waveform of an electric current, you must
first send the current through a small resistor. You can then use the oscilloscope to view the voltage wave
across the resistor. Other quantities, such as temperatures, pressures, speeds, and accelerations, can be
translated into voltages by means of suitable transducers and then viewed on the oscilloscope. A detailed
discussion of the oscilloscope is presented in chapter 6 of this module.
