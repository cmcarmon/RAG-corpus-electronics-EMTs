Resistance Split-Phase Motors
These motors have an auxiliary winding which simply has higher resistance
than the main winding and is displaced spatially on the stator by about 90(cid:176).
Both  windings  are  distributed  on  the  stator  surface  and  are  connected  to
the line voltage, but the different time constants between them makes the
