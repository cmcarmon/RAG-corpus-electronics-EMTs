12 Note that function Cs(v) is periodic on the v axis where its fundamental
‘‘period’’ is vs ¼ 2p. The role of the fundamental ‘‘frequency’’ in this formu-
lation is the quantity Ts ¼ vs=2p ¼ 1. Hence, the harmonic frequencies are
the numbers nTs ¼ n, n  0.
13 In fact, since Cs( v) is even, the IDTFT in the deﬁnition can be replaced by
a cosine transform:
