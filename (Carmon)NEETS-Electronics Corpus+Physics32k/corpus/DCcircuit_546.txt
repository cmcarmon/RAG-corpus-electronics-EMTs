If we were to connect a voltmeter between points 2 and 1, red test lead to point 2 and black
test lead to point 1, the meter would register +45 volts. Typically the ”+” sign is not shown,
but rather implied, for positive readings in digital meter displays. However, for this lesson the
polarity of the voltage reading is very important and so I will show positive numbers explicitly:
