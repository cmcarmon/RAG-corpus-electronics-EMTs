Among many VLSI implementations, a modiﬁed trace-back
Viterbi algorithm (Truong, 1992) has been proposed to save
register storage. The survivor path is traced back through the
trellis diagram and used to determine the decoded information
bit in the window of length 5K. Besides, a 1-Gb/s K ¼ 2
convolutional code sliding block Viterbi decoder has been
recently reported (Black and Menge, 1997). It is designed for
a high throughput magnetic and optical storage channel. Both
backward and forward processing exist, with total window
length of M ¼ 2L where L ¼ 5K . However, L ¼ 3 is chosen
for performance/complexity trade-off. Thus, each processing
unit uses an L-stage trace-back decoding unit.
Its fully
systolic architecture results in a very high throughput of
2Lfclk ¼ 2  6  83 ’ 1 Gb/s, where fclk ¼ 83 MHz. Each pipe-
line stage is an add-compare-select (ACS) unit. The fabricated
chip size is 9:21  8:77 nm2 with a 1.2-mm double-metal
CMOS technology.
