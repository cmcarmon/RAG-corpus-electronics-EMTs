Another mandatory feature of the IEEE 1149.1 Standard is the instruction register and an associated list of
mandatory/permissible instructions that govern the behavior of the IC component during testing. The three
mandatory instructions are called SAMPLE/PRELOAD, BYPASS, and EXTEST. SAMPLE allows taking a snap-
shot of the normal operation of the IC, whereas PRELOAD is used for shifting the captured values out while
new  values  are  loaded  into  the  boundary-scan  register.  BYPASS  allows  shortening  the  (electrical)  distance
between the TDI and TDO pins by providing a single-bit register as a shortcut during scan operations involving
multiple IC components that are connected in series. EXTEST is the “workhorse” instruction that allows driving
the signal values on the component’s output pads from the boundary register while capturing the input values
into their respective cells in the boundary register. This is followed by shifting the captured values out (using
the TDO output) while simultaneously shifting in the new driving values (using the TDI input).
