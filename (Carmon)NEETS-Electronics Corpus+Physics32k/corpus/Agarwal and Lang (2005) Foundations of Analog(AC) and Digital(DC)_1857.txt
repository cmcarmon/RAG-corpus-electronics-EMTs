At this point you should protest. No waveform measured in the labora-
tory will have a ‘‘j ’’ associated with it. The problem arises because we have
used a complex rather than a real drive. That is, we have analyzed the cir-
cuit shown in Figure 13.4a, rather than Figure 13.3. The complex exponential
drive ˜vi can be represented by the Euler relation as the sum of two sources
as depicted in Figure 13.4a. If the circuit is linear, the two-source circuit can
be analyzed by superposition, as suggested in Figure 13.4b and 13.4c. Specifi-
cally, the voltage ˜vcp can be found by summing the response to Vi cos(ωt), as
obtained from Figure 13.4b with j times the response to Vi sin(ωt), as found from
Figure 13.4c:
