Mechanical  applications  range  from  stacked  actuators  through  inchworms,  microangle  adjusting  devices,
and  oil  pressure  servovalves.  Multilayer  actuators  produce  large  displacements  and  high  forces  at  low  drive
voltages. The linear change in capacitance with applied stress of an electrostrictor can be used as a capacitive
stress gauge [Sundar and Newnham, 1992]. Electrostrictors may also be used as used in ﬁeld-tunable piezo-
electric transducers. Recently, electrostrictive materials have been integrated into ultrasonic motors and novel
ﬂextensional transducers.
