If a dipole is used as the source of transmission, energy will be radiated from the antenna into space 
as well as toward the reflector. Energy which is not directed toward the paraboloid has a wide-beam 
characteristic which will destroy the narrow pattern of the parabolic reflector. However, a 
HEMISPHERICAL SHIELD (not shown) may be used to direct most of the radiation toward the 
parabolic surface and thus prevent the destruction of the narrow pattern. Direct radiation into space is 
eliminated, the beam is made sharper, and more power is concentrated in the beam. Without the shield, 
some of the radiated field would leave the radiator directly. Since this part of the field that would leave 
the radiator would not be reflected, it would not become a part of the main beam and could serve no 
useful purpose.
