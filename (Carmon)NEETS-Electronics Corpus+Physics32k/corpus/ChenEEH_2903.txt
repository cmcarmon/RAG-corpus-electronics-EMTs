A pulse Doppler radar uses the Doppler shift to discriminate
moving targets from stationary clutter. A low PRF radar has a
long unambiguous range but results in blind speeds. On the
contrary, a high PRF radar can avoid blind speeds but experi-
ences ambiguity in range. MTI usually refers to a radar in
which the PRF is low enough to avoid ambiguity in range
but results in blind speeds. The pulse Doppler radar operates
with high PRF to avoid blind speeds but at the expense of
range ambiguity.
