A servo valve receives pressurized hydraulic fluid from a source, typically a hydraulic pump. It then transfers the fluid to a hydraulic cylinder at a pressure that is proportional to an electrical signal that it receives. Most hydraulic control valves are binary, they are either on or off. Servo valves are different in that they can continuously vary the pressure they supply from zero up to the pressure that they receive from their source.
Servo valves are often used in a feedback control where the position or force on the hydraulic cylinder they are connected to is measured, and fed back into a controller that varies the electrical control signal sent to the servo valve. This allows very precise control of the cylinder.
