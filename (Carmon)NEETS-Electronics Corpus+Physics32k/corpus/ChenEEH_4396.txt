then So(0) ¼ 0pp results in er (1) ¼ 0. A sufﬁcient condition
for the dc gain of the sensitivity matrix to vanish is that every
entry of Lo(s) must have at least one pole at the origin. This is
the generalization of system type to MIMO systems. Further-
more, if So(0) ¼ 0pp, the steady-state error contributed by a
vector of step functions at the output disturbances, do(s), will
also be zero. An additional condition is needed for zero steady-
state error contributed by a vector of step functions at the
input disturbances, di(s). A sufﬁcient condition is that the
plant has no entries with poles at the origin.
Making T (0) ¼ I results in the desired zero steady-state
errors to vectors of step functions at the reference inputs and
at the input and output disturbances. This choice, however,
has the undesirable effect of making the error contributed by
the dc component of the sensor noise not to be attenuated.
This is a common trade-off in control systems, which does not
affect the desired performance as long as the signal-to-noise
ratio for low frequencies is made sufﬁciently high.
