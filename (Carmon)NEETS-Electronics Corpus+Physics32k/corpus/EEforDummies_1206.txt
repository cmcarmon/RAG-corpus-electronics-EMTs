You can make it easier to use battery power when you build a circuit on a 
breadboard using just a switch and a few wires, as shown in Figure 17-2. Use 
a single‐pole, double‐throw (SPDT) switch to connect the positive battery 
terminal to the top positive supply rail (in Chapter 4, I explain this process in 
detail). Then connect the positive supply rails on top and bottom using a red 
wire, and the negative supply rails on top and bottom using a black wire, so 
that power is available on both the top and the bottom of the board.
