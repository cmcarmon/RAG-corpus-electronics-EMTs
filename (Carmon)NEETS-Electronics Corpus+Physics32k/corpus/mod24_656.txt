In an ELED the rear facet is highly reflective and the front facet is antireflection-coated. The rear
facet reflects the light propagating toward the rear end-face back toward the front facet. By coating the
front facet with antireflection material, the front facet reduces optical feedback and allows light emission.
ELEDs emit light only through the front facet.
