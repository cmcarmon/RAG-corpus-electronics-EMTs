flow, whereas for negative voltages very small currents flow. Figure 4.22b
draws the v i curve using a larger scale and highlights this dichotomy. The
crudest approximation that preserves this dichotomy is the characteristic shown
in Figure 4.23a: two linear segments intersecting at the origin, one of zero slope,
indicating the behavior of an open circuit, the other infinite, indicating a short
circuit. The abstraction is of sufficient use that we give it a special symbol, as
shown in Figure 4.23b. This is yet another primitive in our vocabulary, called
an ideal diode.
