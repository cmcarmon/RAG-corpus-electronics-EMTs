Amplitude modulating a simple rf carrier to a point where it becomes drastically overmodulated
could produce a waveform similar to that required in pulse modulation. A modulating signal [view (A) of
figure 2-27] that is much larger than the carrier results in the modulation envelope shown in view (B).
The modulation envelope would be the same if the modulating wave shape were not sinusoidal; that is,
like the one shown in view (C).
