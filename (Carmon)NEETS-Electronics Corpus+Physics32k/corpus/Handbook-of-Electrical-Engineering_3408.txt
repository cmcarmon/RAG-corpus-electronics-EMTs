D/A Converter ICs
Most  D/A  converters  are  designed  for  general-purpose  control  applications.  Some  D/A  converters,  however,
are  designed  for  special  applications,  such  as  video  or  graphic  outputs,  high-deÔ¨Ånition  video  displays,  ultra
high-speed signal processing, digital video tape recording, digital attenuators, or high-speed function generators.
D/A converter ICs often include special features that enable them to be interfaced easily to microprocessors
or  other  systems.  Microprocessor  control  inputs,  input  latches,  buffers,  input  registers,  and  compatibility  to
standard logic families are features that are readily available in D/A ICs. In addition, the ICs usually have laser-
trimmed precision resistors to eliminate the need for user trimming to achieve full-scale performance.
