Then, with vIN treated as a known signal, the equations representing the
output side of the circuit, namely Equations 2.180, 2.181, 2.183, and 2.185,
can be solved by themselves to yield the values of vOUT, iOUT, vR, and iR (see
a result that is identical to that obtained for the
Equations 2.188 and 2.189)
circuit in Figure 2.25.
