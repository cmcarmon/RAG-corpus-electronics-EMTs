It is quite common in synchro systems to transmit the same data at two different speeds. For 
example, ship's course information is usually transmitted to other locations on a ship at 1-speed and 36-
speed. A system in which data is transmitted at two different speeds is called a dual- or double-speed 
system. Sometimes a dual-speed system will be referred to by the speeds involved, for example a 1- and 
36-speed system.
