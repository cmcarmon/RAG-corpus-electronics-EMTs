Fiber point defects occur from factory fiber splices or bends introduced during cable construction or
installation. For shipboard applications, manufacturers are not allowed to splice fibers during cable
construction. Fiber joints are natural sources of OTDR point defects. However, fiber breaks, cracks, or
microbends introduced during cable installation are additional sources of point defects.
