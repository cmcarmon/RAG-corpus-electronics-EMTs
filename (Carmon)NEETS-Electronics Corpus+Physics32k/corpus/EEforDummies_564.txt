You can also determine which end is what by measuring the resistance of the 
diode (before you insert it in your circuit) with an ohmmeter or multimeter 
(which I discuss in Chapter 16). The diode has a low resistance when it’s 
 forward‐biased, and a high resistance when it’s reverse‐biased. By applying 
the positive lead of your meter to the anode and the negative lead to the 
cathode, your meter is essentially forward‐biasing the diode (because when 
used to measure resistance, a multimeter applies a small voltage across its 
leads). You can measure the resistance twice, applying the leads first one 
way and then the other way. The lower measurement result indicates the 
 forward‐biased condition.
