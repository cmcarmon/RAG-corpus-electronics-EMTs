situations when the wire is made from a very good conductor,
unless the wire is too thin (which results in very high ohmic
resistance), only a small fraction of the input power is dissi-
pated as ohmic loss. Most of the input power is thus radiated
into the free space, resulting in a good radiation efÔ¨Åciency.
