exists and equals the corresponding expected value E[X(t)], then the process X(t) is said to possess an ergodic
property associated with the mean. There are ergodic properties associated with the mean, autocorrelation (and
power spectral density), and all ﬁnite-order joint moments, as well as ﬁnite-order joint pdf’s. If a process has
all possible ergodic properties, it is said to be an ergodic process.
