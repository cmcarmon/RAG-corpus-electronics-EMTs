As a battery discharges, not only does it diminish its internal store of energy, but its in-
ternal resistance also increases (as the electrolyte becomes less and less conductive), and its
open-circuit cell voltage decreases (as the chemicals become more and more dilute). The most
deceptive change that a discharging battery exhibits is increased resistance. The best check
for a battery’s condition is a voltage measurement under load, while the battery is supply-
ing a substantial current through a circuit. Otherwise, a simple voltmeter check across the
terminals may falsely indicate a healthy battery (adequate voltage) even though the internal
resistance has increased considerably. What constitutes a ”substantial current” is determined
by the battery’s design parameters. A voltmeter check revealing too low of a voltage, of course,
would positively indicate a discharged battery:
