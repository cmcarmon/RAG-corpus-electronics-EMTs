We would like the user of a MOSFET amplifier to be able to treat it as
the abstract entity depicted in Figure 7.28, ignoring the internal details of the
circuit. This abstract amplifier has vIN and iIN at its input port and vO and iO
at its output port, and provides power gain. Details such as the power supply
and the like are hidden from the user. The amplifier shown in Figure 7.28 uses
ground as an implicit second terminal for both the input port and the output
port. This form of amplifier is also called the single-ended amplifier.
