Radiation resistance varies at different points on the antenna. This resistance is always measured at a 
current loop. For the antenna in free space, that is, entirely removed from any objects that might affect its 
operation, the radiation resistance is 73 ohms. A practical antenna located over a ground plane may have 
any value of radiation resistance from 0 to approximately 100 ohms. The exact value of radiation 
resistance depends on the height of the antenna above the ground. For most half-wave wire antennas, the 
radiation resistance is about 65 ohms. It will usually vary between 55 and 600 ohms for antennas 
constructed of rod or tubing. The actual value of radiation resistance, so long as it is 50 ohms or more, has 
little effect on the radiation efficiency of the antenna. This is because the ohmic resistance is about 1 ohm 
for conductors of large diameter. The ohmic resistance does not become important until the radiation 
resistance drops to a value less than 10 ohms. This may be the case when several antennas are coupled 
together.
