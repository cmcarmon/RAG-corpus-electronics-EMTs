After the capacitor has charged to its peak value, the diode will cut off and the capacitor will start to 
discharge. Since the fall of the ac input voltage on the anode is considerably more rapid than the decrease 
on the capacitor voltage, the cathode quickly become more positive than the anode, and the diode ceases 
to conduct.
