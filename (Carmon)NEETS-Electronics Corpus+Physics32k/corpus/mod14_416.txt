A register is a temporary storage device. Registers are used to store data, memory addresses, and
operation codes. Registers are normally referred to by the number of stages they contain or by the number
of bits they will store. For instance, an eight-stage register would be called an 8-bit register. The contents
of the register is also called a WORD. The contents of an 8-bit register is an 8-bit word. The contents of a
4-bit register is a 4-bit word and so forth.
