In most digital systems, a clock signal is provided to different modules of the
system. A clock signal is typically a square wave between 0 volts and the supply
voltage. The clock signal provides a global time base that prescribes when
actions happen in systems. The use of a clock attempts to solve the following
problem faced by the receiver in a pair of communicating digital systems: How
to determine when a signal supplied by the sender is valid. Or conversely,
how to recognize when a signal might be in the midst of transitioning to a
new value. For example, we might use a stable-high clock discipline in which
the sender promises to provide output signals so that they remain stable during
the high part of the clock waveform. In other words, signals are allowed to
transition only during the low parts of a clock. Correspondingly, the receiver
promises to observe incoming signals only when the clock is high. Accordingly,
the receiver circuit guarantees that its own outputs are stable when the clock is
high, provided, of course, valid inputs are fed to it.
