An enzymatic reaction can be sensed by measuring the rise in temperature associated with the heat of reaction
or  by  the  detection  and  measurement  of  byproducts.  In  the  glucose  example,  the  reaction  can  be  sensed  by
measuring the local dissolved peroxide concentration. This is done via an electrochemical analysis technique
called  amperometry  [Bard  and  Faulkner,  1980].  In  this  method,  a  potential  is  placed  across  two  inert  metal
