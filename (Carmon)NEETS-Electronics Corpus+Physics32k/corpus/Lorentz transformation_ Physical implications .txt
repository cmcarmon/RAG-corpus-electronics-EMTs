A critical requirement of the Lorentz transformations is the invariance of the speed of light, a fact used in their derivation, and contained in the transformations themselves. If in F the equation for a pulse of light along the x direction is x = ct, then in F′ the Lorentz transformations give x′ = ct′, and vice versa, for any −c < v < c.
For relative speeds much less than the speed of light, the Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformation

in accordance with the correspondence principle. It is sometimes said that nonrelativistic physics is a physics of "instantaneous action at a distance".
Three unintuitive, but correct, predictions of the transformations are:
Time dilation
Suppose there is a clock at rest in F. If a time interval (say a "tick") is measured at the same point so that Δx = 0, then the transformations give this tick in F′ by Δt′ = γΔt. Conversely, suppose there is a clock at rest in F′. If a tick is measured at the same point so that Δx′ = 0, then the transformations give this tick in F by Δt = γΔt′. Either way, the boosted observer measures longer time intervals than the observer in the other frame.
Relativity of simultaneity
Suppose two events occur simultaneously (Δt = 0) along the x axis, but separated by a nonzero displacement Δx. Then in F′, we find that

, so the events are no longer simultaneous according to a moving observer.
Length contraction
Suppose there is a rod at rest in F aligned along the x axis, with length Δx. In F′, the rod moves with velocity -v, so its length must be measured by taking two simultaneous (Δt′ = 0) measurements at opposite ends. Under these conditions, the inverse Lorentz transform shows that Δx = γΔx′. In F the two measurements are no longer simultaneous, but this does not matter because the rod is at rest in F. We conclude that the boosted observer measures a shorter length, by a factor of γ, than the observer in the rest frame of the rod. Length contraction affects any geometric quantity related to lengths, so from the perspective of a moving observer, areas and volumes will also appear to shrink along the direction of motion.
