where  A is  the  surface  area  of  each  plate,  d is  the  distance  between
the plates,  and 
is  the  permittivity  of  the  dielectric  material  between
the plates. Although Eq. (6.2) applies to only parallel-plate capacitors,
we may infer from it that, in general, three factors determine the value
of the capacitance:
