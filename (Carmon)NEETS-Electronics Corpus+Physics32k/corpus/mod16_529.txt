L, R, and C terminals 1, 2, and 3 are used to connect unknown resistors, inductors, and capacitors to
the bridge. Resistors and inductors are connected between terminals 1 and 2, and capacitors are connected
between terminals 2 and 3. EXT BIAS terminals are normally connected with a shorting lug. They allow
insertion of a dc voltage or current to bias capacitors or inductors. EXT DET connector is a BNC coaxial
socket that allows an external detector to be used with the instrument. It is connected to the bridge at ALL
TIMES.
