Although  the  problems  to  be  solved  during  oneâ€™s  career  will  vary  in
complexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be followed remain

authors  over  many  years  of  problem  solving  with  students,  for  the
solution of engineering problems in industry, and for problem solving
in research.
