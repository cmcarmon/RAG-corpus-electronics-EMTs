Notice that the range resistors are connected through the switch so as to be in parallel
with the meter movement, rather than in series as it was in the voltmeter design. The ﬁve-
position switch makes contact with only one resistor at a time, of course. Each resistor is
sized accordingly for a different full-scale range, based on the particular rating of the meter
movement (1 mA, 500 Ω).
