Figure 36-25 shows a simple series regulator. The 
input is unregulated DC voltage, and the output is a 
lower, regulated DC voltage. The transistor is con-
nected as an emitter follower, meaning that there is a 
lack of phase inversion between the base and the emit-
ter. The emitter voltage follows the base voltage. The 
load is connected between the emitter of the transistor 
and ground. The voltage at the base of the transistor is 
set by the zener diode. Therefore, the output voltage is 
equal to the zener voltage minus the 0.7-volt dropped 
across the base-emitter junction of the transistor.
