There’s nothing special about the power rails — except their labels and 
color coding — so you are free to connect anything you want to these 
columns. If you’re smart, however, you’ll take advantage of the labels to 
help keep track of your power connections. I recommend that you con-
nect the positive power supply to the positive power rail on one side of 
the board, and use the negative power rail on the other side of the board 
for your ground connection.
