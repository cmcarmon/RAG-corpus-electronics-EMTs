Recent and planned tests relevant to the cosmological and Copernican principles include:
time drift of cosmological redshifts;
modelling the local gravitational potential using reflection of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons;
the redshift dependence of the luminosity of supernovae;
the kinetic Sunyaev-Zelâ€™dovich effect in relation to dark energy;
cosmic neutrino background;
the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect
testing the isotropy and homogeneity of the CMB;
