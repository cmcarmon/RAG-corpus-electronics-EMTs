current altogether, as shown in Figure 11.3.5(b), which represents the transformer by its equivalent
series impedance. When Req is small compared to Xeq, as in the case of large power-system
transformers, Req may frequently be neglected for certain system studies. The transformer is
then modeled by its equivalent series reactance Xeq only, as shown in Figure 11.3.5(c). The
student should have no difÔ¨Åculty in drawing these approximate equivalent circuits referred to the
secondary.
