The topic of defect prevention is outside the primary scope of this article. However, it is important to note
that the set of technologies associated with defect prevention must be utilized concurrently with the technologies
of defect removal in order to achieve high levels of ﬁnal quality. The technologies which prevent defects are those
concerned with optimizing both clarity and structure and with minimizing ambiguity. Joint application design
(JAD) for preventing requirements defects; prototyping; reuse of certiﬁed material; clean-room development;
any of the standard structured analysis, design, and coding techniques; and quality function deployment (QFD)
for evaluating end-user quality demands are examples of the technologies associated with defect prevention.
Many aspects of total quality management (TQM) programs are also associated with defect prevention.
