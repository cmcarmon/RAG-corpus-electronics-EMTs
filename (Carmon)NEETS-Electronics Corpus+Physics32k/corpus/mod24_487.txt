Measuring the cutoff wavelength involves comparing the transmitted power from the test fiber with
that of a reference fiber at different wavelengths. The reference fiber can be the same piece of single
mode fiber with small bends introduced or a piece of multimode fiber. If the same fiber with small bends
is used as the reference fiber, the technique is called the bend-reference technique. If a piece of
multimode fiber is used as the reference fiber, the technique is called the multimode-reference
technique.
