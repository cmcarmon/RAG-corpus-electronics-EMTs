A properly biased N-channel depletion MOSFET is 
shown in Figure 32-10. Note that it is biased the same 
way as an N-channel JFET. The drain-to-source volt-
age (EDS) must always be applied so that the drain is 
positive with respect to the source. The gate-to-source 
voltage (EDS) can be applied with the polarity reversed. 
The substrate is usually connected to the source,  either 
internally or externally. In special applications, the 
substrate may be connected to the gate or another 
point within the FET circuit.
