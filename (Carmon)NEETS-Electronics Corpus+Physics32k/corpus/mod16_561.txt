MEDIUM 2 RANGE.The medium 2 range is designed to test for resistance values between 1KΩ 
and 200KΩ Figure 5-32 shows the signatures for a 1KΩ resistor, a 15KΩ resistor, and a 200KΩ resistor 
in the medium 2 range. Resistance values that are smaller than 1KΩ will appear to be almost a vertical 
line. A 15KΩ resistor causes a change in the angle of rotation of 45º, whereas the display for a 200KΩ 
resistor shows only a slight rotation. When resistance values being tested are higher than 200KΩ, the 
displayed signature that they produce will have such a small rotation that it appears to be almost a
