A three-layer feed-forward neural network, with 11 inputs and
5 hidden nodes, is used to approximate both F[  ] and G[  ]. A
projection algorithm is applied to ensure 0 < gmin < G[  ],
while u(k) is bounded by 0:05  u(k)  0:95. Simulation
results are shown in Figure 10.8. As before, a step disturbance
of 15 Nm is applied to the system as a load torque after 40
engine cycles and then removed (unloaded) after 120 engine
cycles. Elements of the neural network structure vector A are
initially chosen as random numbers between 0 and 1, and the
data shown in the ﬁgures are collected after training the neural
networks for 500 engine cycles. Engine speed variations are
evident, but it can be seen that the controller is capable of
rejecting typical bad disturbances. We note the presence of a
small steady-state error (about 0.5 RPM). This is because the
controller can only bring the system state trajectories into a
