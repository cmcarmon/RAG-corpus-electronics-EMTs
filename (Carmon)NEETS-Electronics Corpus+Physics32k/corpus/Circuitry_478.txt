Bistables 
 
The  output  of  a  bistable  has  two  stables  states 
(logic 0 or logic 1) and, once set in one or other of 
these  states,  the  device  will  remain  at  a  particular 
logic  level  for  an  indefinite  period  until  reset.  A 
bistable thus constitutes a simple form of ‘memory 
cell’  because  it  will  remain  in  its  latched  state 
(whether set or reset) until a signal is applied to it 
in  order  to  change  its  state  (or  until  the  supply  is 
disconnected).
