If either the electron or positron, or both, have appreciable kinetic energies, other heavier particles can also be produced (such as D mesons or B mesons), since there is enough kinetic energy in the relative velocities to provide the rest energies of those particles. Alternatively, it is possible to produce photons and other light particles, but they will emerge with higher kinetic energies.
At energies near and beyond the mass of the carriers of the weak force, the W and Z bosons, the strength of the weak force becomes comparable to the electromagnetic force. As a result, it becomes much easier to produce particles such as neutrinos that interact only weakly with other matter.
The heaviest particle pairs yet produced by electron–positron annihilation in particle accelerators are W+–W− pairs. The heaviest single particle is the Z boson. The driving motivation for constructing the International Linear Collider is to produce the Higgs bosons in this way.
