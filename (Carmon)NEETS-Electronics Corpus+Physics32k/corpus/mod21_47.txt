Direct current voltage may be steady, pulsating, or have ac superimposed on it. The average value of
a dc waveform depends on the symmetry of the wave and other aspects of the wave shape. It can vary
from 63.6% of peak value for a rectified full sine wave to 50% of peak value for a triangular wave. For a
superimposed sine wave, the average value can be zero. Regardless of whether the dc is steady, pulsating,
or the ac is superimposed on the dc, a rectifier form of measuring device will indicate its average value.
