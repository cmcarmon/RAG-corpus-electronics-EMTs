Equation clocks, as such, are no longer widely used. However, components functionally the same as those in equation clocks are still used in, for example, solar trackers, which move so as to follow the movements of the Sun in the sky. Many of them do not sense the position of the Sun. Instead, they have a mechanism which rotates about a polar axis at a constant speed of 15 degrees per hour, keeping pace with the average speed of the Earth's rotation relative to the Sun. Sometimes, a digital representation of this rotation is generated, rather than physical rotation of a component. The equation of time is then added to this constant rotation, producing a rotation of the tracker that keeps pace with the apparent motion of the Sun. Generally, these machines use modern technology, involving electronics and computers, instead of the mechanical devices that were used in historic equation clocks, but the function is the same.
