of  the  parallel  tuned  circuit,  the  Q-factor  will 
increase  as 
increases.  The 
response  of  a  tuned  circuit  can  be  modified  by 
incorporating  a  resistance  of  appropriate  value 
either  to  ‘dampen’  (low-Q) or  ‘sharpen’  (high-Q)
the  response.  The  relationship  between  bandwidth 
and Q-factor is:
