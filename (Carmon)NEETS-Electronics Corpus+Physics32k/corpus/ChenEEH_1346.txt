The existence of caches local to each processor in a multi-

Multiple copies of data could possibly exist in different caches
simultaneously due to shared data structures or because of
process migration between processors. Each processor must
be sure that when it reads a line of memory from its cache,
the line has not been previously overwritten in the cache of
