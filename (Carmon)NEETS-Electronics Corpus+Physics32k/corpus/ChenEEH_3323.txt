where P is the vector of bus power injections. The resulting
solution for the bus voltage phase angles is called the dc power
ﬂow model. It gives approximate values for the phase angles
across the power system. The phase angles can be used to
approximate the real power ﬂow on any transmission line by
dividing the phase angle difference between the two ends of the
transmission lines by the line reactance. The advantage of the
dc power ﬂow model is its extreme simplicity in ﬁnding a
power ﬂow solution. The limitations of the solution need to
be kept in mind, however, in light of the drastic assumptions
that were used to simplify the nonlinear power ﬂow equations
into linear equations.
