Motion reference units are a kind of inertial measurement unit with single- or multi-axis motion sensors. They utilize MEMS gyroscopes. Some multi-axis MRUs are capable of measuring roll, pitch, yaw and heave. They have applications outside the aeronautical field, such as:
Antenna motion compensation and stabilization
Dynamic positioning
Heave compensation of offshore cranes
High speed craft motion control and damping systems
Hydro acoustic positioning
Motion compensation of single and multibeam echosounders
Ocean wave measurements
Offshore structure motion monitoring
Orientation and attitude measurements on Autonomous underwater vehicles and Remotely operated underwater vehicles
Ship motion monitoring
