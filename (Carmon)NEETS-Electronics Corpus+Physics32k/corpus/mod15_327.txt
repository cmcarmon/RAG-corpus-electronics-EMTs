Any force acting through the center of gravity of the gyroscope does not change the angle of the 
plane of rotation but moves the gyroscope as a unit. The position of its spin axis in space is not changed. 
Such forces as those stated above, operating through the center of gravity, are forces of TRANSLATION. 
In other words, the spinning gyroscope may be moved freely in space by means of its supporting frame,
