The structure of a quadrature 908 hybrid has two series
quarter-wavelength sections that are connected by two shunt
quarter-wavelength sections, as shown in Figure 7.17 for a
microstrip realization. In most practical cases, the equal power
dividing (3-dB) structure is most popular. For a lossless hybrid,
