Hence  the  ripple  produced  by  this  arrangement 
(with  1  V  of  50  Hz  a.c.  superimposed  on  the 
rectified  input)  will  be  a  mere  1  mV.  It  is  worth 
comparing  this  value  with  that  obtained  from  the 
previous example!  
  Finally, it is important to note that the amount of 
ripple present at the output of a power supply will 
increase when the supply is loaded.
