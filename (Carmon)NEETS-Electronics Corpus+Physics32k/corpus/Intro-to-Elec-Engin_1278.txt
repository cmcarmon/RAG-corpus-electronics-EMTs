Foremost among signal concepts is spectral analysis (representation of signals in terms of
their frequency components), a concept that serves as a unifying thread in signal processing and
communication systems. Signals and spectral analysis are considered ﬁrst in Section 14.1. Then
in Section 14.2, processing techniques such as equalization, ﬁltering, sampling, modulation, and
multiplexing are presented, while topics on interference and noise are exposed in Section 14.3. The
circuit functions required for time-domain processing parallel those needed for frequency-domain
processing.
