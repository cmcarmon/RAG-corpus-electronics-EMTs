Figure 1.20 shows a four-module interleaved QSW VRM
prototype picture.
In the VRM, an integrated magnetic
design is used. Every two inductors use one magnetic core.
As a result, in total, two magnetic cores are used for these
four channel inductors. Figure 1.21 shows the integrated mag-
netic structure (Chen 1999). By taking advantage of the inter-
leaving technology, the AC ï¬‚ux of the two inductors is
canceled out in the center leg. As a result, the core loss and
center leg crossing area are reduced. The planar core structure
