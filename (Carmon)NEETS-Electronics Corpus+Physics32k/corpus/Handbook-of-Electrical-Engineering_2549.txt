Consider the numerical implications of this: if IC = 1 mA, then gm . 39 mA/V (at room temperature), so
1/gm . 26 W, which is a very low output resistance indeed. In fact, though it appears in parallel with RE, it is
unlikely that RE will make any signiﬁcant contribution because it is usually hundreds or thousands of ohms.
Example 4
Using the same bias resistors as for the CE examples, ﬁnd the output resistance at the emitter of a CC stage.
