(c) For relatively undistorted ampliﬁcation, the
MOSFET circuit must be restricted to sig-
nal variations within the active region. Let
vGS (t ) = 4 + 0.2 sin ωt V. Sketch iD(t)
and vDS(t), and estimate the resulting voltage
ampliﬁcation Av.
(d) Let vGS (t ) = 6 sin ωt, where ω is slow
enough to satisfy the static condition. Sketch
iD(t) and vDS(t) obtained from the transfer
curves. Comment on the action of the MOS-
FET in the switching circuit.
