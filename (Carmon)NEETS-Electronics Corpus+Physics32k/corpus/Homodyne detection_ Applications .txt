Homodyne and heterodyne techniques are commonly used in thermoreflectance techniques.
In the processing of signals in some applications of magnetic resonance imaging, homodyne detection can offer advantages over magnitude detection. The homodyne technique can suppress excessive noise and undesired quadrature components (90Â° out-of-phase), and provide stable access to information that may be encoded into the phase or polarity of images.
An encrypted secure communication system can be based on quantum key distribution (QKD). An efficient receiver scheme for implementing QKD is balanced homodyne detection (BHD) using a positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode.
Homodyne detection was one of the key techniques in demonstrating spooky action at a distance.
