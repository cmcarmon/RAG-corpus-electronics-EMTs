Assume the TDR rotor is initially at 0º. TX No. 1 is turned to 75º, and TX rotor No. 2 is turned to 
30º. The TDR stator field still rotates counterclockwise 75º, but because R1 and R3 on the TDR rotor are 
reversed, its rotor field rotates 30º clockwise. The angular displacement of the two fields then, with 
respect to each other, is the sum of the signals transmitted by the two TXs. The magnetic force pulling the 
TDR rotor field into alignment with that of the stator turns the TDR rotor to 105º. Therefore, the system 
solves the equation 75º  + 30º  = 105º.
