Increasing Impact of Interconnection Delays on Design
In  earlier  generations  of VLSI  technology  (with  larger  transistors  and  wider  interconnection  lines/spacings),
delays through the low-level logic gates greatly dominated delays along interconnection lines. This was largely
the result of the lower resistance of the larger cross-section interconnections. Under these conditions, a single
pass through a design sequence such as shown in Fig. 25.24 was often adequate. In particular, the placement
of blocks on the ICs, although impacting the lengths of interconnections among blocks, did not have a major
impact on performance since the gate delays within the blocks were substantially larger than interconnection
delays between blocks. Under such conditions, the steps of ï¬‚oorplanning and of placement and routing focused
on such objectives as minimum overall area and minimum interconnection area.
