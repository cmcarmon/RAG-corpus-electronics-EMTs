6.3 Wireline Channels4
Wireline channels were the ﬁrst used for electrical communications in the mid-nineteenth century for the
telegraph. Here, the channel is one of several wires connecting transmitter to receiver. The transmitter
simply creates a voltage related to the message signal and applies it to the wire(s). We must have a circuit—
a closed path—that supports current ﬂow. In the case of single-wire communications, the earth is used as the
current’s return path. In fact, the term ground for the reference node in circuits originated in single-wire
telegraphs. You can imagine that the earth’s electrical characteristics are highly variable, and they are.
Single-wire metallic channels cannot support high-quality signal transmission having a bandwidth beyond a
few hundred Hertz over any appreciable distance.
