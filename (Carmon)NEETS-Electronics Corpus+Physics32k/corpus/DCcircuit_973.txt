The primary advantage of Mesh Current analysis is that it generally allows for the solution
of a large network with fewer unknown values and fewer simultaneous equations. Our example
problem took three equations to solve the Branch Current method and only two equations using
the Mesh Current method. This advantage is much greater as networks increase in complexity:
