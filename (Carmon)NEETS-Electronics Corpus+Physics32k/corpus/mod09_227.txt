For a given RC network, only one frequency of the initial noise signal will be shifted exactly 180 
degrees. In other words, the network is frequency selective. Therefore, the RC network is the frequency-
determining device since the lengths of the vectors and their phase relationships depend on frequency. 
The frequency of oscillations is governed by the values of resistance and capacitance in these sections. 
Variable resistors and capacitors may be used to provide tuning in the feedback network to allow for 
minor variations in phase shift. For an RC phase-shift oscillator, the amplifier is biased for class A 
operation to minimize distortion of the wave or signal.
