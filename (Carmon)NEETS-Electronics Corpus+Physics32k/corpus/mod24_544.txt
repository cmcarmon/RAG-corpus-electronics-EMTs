The installation and repair of fiber optic components on board ship can affect system operation.
Microbends introduced during installation can increase fiber attenuation. Modal redistribution at fiber
joints can increase fiber attenuation in the fiber after the joint. Fiber breaks or faults can prevent or
severely disrupt system operation. Poor fiber connections can also increase insertion loss and degrade
transmitter and receiver performance by increasing reflectance and return loss. End users should perform
field measurements to verify that component performance is within allowable limits so system
performance is not adversely affected.
