POINT DEFECTS.â€”Point defects are temporary or local deviations of the OTDR signal in the
upward or downward direction. A point defect, or fault, can be reflective or nonreflective. A point defect
normally exhibits a loss of optical power. However, a point defect may exhibit an apparent power gain. In
some cases, a point defect can even exhibit no loss or gain. Refer back to figure 5-13; it illustrates a
reflective fault and a nonreflective fault, both exhibiting loss. Figure 5-15 shows a nonreflective fault with
apparent gain and a reflective fault with no apparent loss or gain.
