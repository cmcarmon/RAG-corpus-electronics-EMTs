The head loss Δh (or hf) expresses the pressure loss due to friction in terms of the equivalent height of a column of the working fluid, so the pressure drop is

{\displaystyle \Delta p=\rho \cdot g\cdot \Delta h,}

where
Δh is the head loss due to pipe friction over the given length of pipe (SI units: m);
g is the local acceleration due to gravity (m/s2).
It is useful to present head loss per length of pipe (dimensionless):

{\displaystyle S={\frac {\Delta h}{L}}={\frac {1}{\rho \cdot g}}\cdot {\frac {\Delta p}{L}},}

where L is the pipe length (m).
Therefore, the Darcy–Weisbach equation can also be written in terms of head loss:
