Although  the  foregoing  requirements  for  an  ideal  op  amp  appear  to  be  impossible  to  achieve  practically,
modern devices can quite closely approximate many of these conditions. An op amp with a ﬁeld-effect transistor
(FET) on the input would certainly not have zero input current and inﬁnite input resistance, but a current of
 is obtainable and is a reasonable approximation to the ideal conditions. Further,
