Batteries  are  calibrated  under  simulated  service  conditions  for  voltage  drop  versus  time.  Bridge-controlled
transmitters are calibrated for strain subcarrier frequency change using a cantilever beam instrumented with
resistance strain gauges. The beam is calibrated for load versus strain using a strain indicator. It is then used
to  calibrate  the  bridge-controlled  transmitters  statically,  by  measuring  the  subcarrier  frequency  change  as  a
function  of  strain.  A  dynamic  calibration  can  also  be  made  by  using  a  second  cantilever  beam  driven  by  a
vibration generator. Two resistance strain gauges are mounted back-to-back on the second beam and calibrated.
One of the gauges is monitored through the telemetry system and the other by wire link to the oscillograph,
and the two signals are then compared. The single-resistance strain gauge transmitter is similarly calibrated,
but in this case, the beam is Ô¨Åxed in a fatigue machine operating at 30 Hz. Calibrations are performed at various
strain levels. Again, two calibrated gauges are monitored and compared, one using the telemetry systems and
the other using wire link.
