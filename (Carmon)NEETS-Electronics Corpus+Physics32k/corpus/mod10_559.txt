This ratio is useful because the instruments used to detect standing waves react to the square of the
voltage. Since power is proportional to the square of the voltage, the ratio of the square of the maximum
and minimum voltages is called the power standing-wave ratio. In a sense, the name is misleading
because the power along a transmission line does not vary.
