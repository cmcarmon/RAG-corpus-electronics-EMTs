{\displaystyle p(t)\,dt=P[k(t)]\exp[-\int _{0}^{t}P[k(t')]\,dt']\,dt}

where P[k(t)]dt is the probability that an electron in the state k suffers a collision during the time dt. Because of the complexity of the integral at the exponent, it is impractical to generate stochastic free flights with the distribution of the equation above. In order to overcome this difficulty, people use a fictitious “self-scattering” scheme. By doing this, the total scattering rate, including this self-scattering, is constant and equal to, say,



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
. By random selection, if self-scattering is selected, k′ after the collision is the same as k and the carrier continues its flight without perturbation. Introducing a constant

Random numbers r can be used very simply to generate stochastic free flights, which duration will then be given by

. The computer time used for self-scattering is more than compensated for by the simplification of the calculation of the free-flight duration. To enhance the speed of free flight time calculation, several schemes such as “Constant Technique”, and “Piecewise Technique” are used to minimize the self-scattering events.
