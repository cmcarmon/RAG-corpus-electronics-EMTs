Analog and digital multimeters are the first 
pieces of equipment used to analyze a circuit. To 
prevent possible circuit damage, the meter should 
have a sensitivity of more than 20,000 ohms per 
volt on the voltage scales. The meter should also not 
pass more than 1 milliampere of current on the re-
sistance scales. Static DC and resistance checks usu-
ally locate power failures or defects that exhibit large 
deviations from the normal on the printed circuit 
board. However, these methods are time-consuming 
and inadequate when the defect is intermittent in 
the circuit.
