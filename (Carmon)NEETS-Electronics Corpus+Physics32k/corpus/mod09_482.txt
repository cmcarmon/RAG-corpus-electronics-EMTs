View (B) of figure 3-49 shows the waveforms when Ea is a square wave. Recall that the inductor  
acts as an open circuit at this first instant. Current now starts to flow and develops a voltage across the 
resistor. With a square wave applied, the voltage across the inductor starts to drop as soon as any voltage 
appears across the resistor. This is due to the fact that the voltage across the inductor and resistor must 
add up to the applied voltage.
