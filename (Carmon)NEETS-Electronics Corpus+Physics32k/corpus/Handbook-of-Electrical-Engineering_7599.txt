Choosing a Logic Family
A  logic  designer  planning  a  system  using  SSI  and  MSI  chips  will  ﬁnd  that  an  extensive  variety  of  circuits  is
available in all three technologies: TTL, ECL, and CMOS. The choice of which technology will dominate the
system is governed by what are often conﬂicting needs, namely, speed, power consumption, noise immunity,
cost, availability, and the ease of interfacing. Sometimes the decision is easy. If the need for a low static power
drain  is  paramount,  CMOS  is  the  only  choice.  It  used  to  be  the  case  that  speed  would  dictate  the  selection;
ECL was high speed, TTL was moderate, and CMOS low. With the advent of advanced TTL and, especially,
advanced CMOS the choice is no longer clear-cut. All three will work at 100 MHz or more. ECL might be used
since it generates the least noise because the transitions are small, yet for that same reason it is more susceptible
to  externally  generated  noise.  Perhaps  TTL  might  be  the  best  compromise  between  noise  generation  and
susceptibility. Advanced CMOS is the noisiest because of its rapid rise and fall times, but the designer might
opt to cope with the noise problems to take advantage of the low standby power requirements.
