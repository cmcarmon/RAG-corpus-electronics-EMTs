Noise
Resistors exhibit electrical noise in the form of small ac voltage ﬂuctuations when dc voltage is applied. Noise
in a resistor is a function of the applied voltage, physical dimensions, and materials. The total noise is a sum
of Johnson noise, current ﬂow noise, noise due to cracked bodies, and loose end caps and leads. For variable
resistors  the  noise  can  also  be  caused  by  the  jumping  of  a  moving  contact  over  turns  and  by  an  imperfect
electrical path between the contact and resistance element.
