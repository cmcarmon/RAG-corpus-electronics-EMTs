The Franki piling system (also called pressure-injected footing) is a method used to drive expanded base cast-in-situ concrete (Franki) piles. It was developed by Belgian Engineer Edgard Frankignoul in 1909 and has achieved considerable worldwide success since.
This method can be applied to different site conditions and is still widely used due to its high tensile load capacity, and relatively low noise and ground vibration levels.
