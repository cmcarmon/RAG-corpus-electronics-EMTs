It wasnâ€™t until the beginning of World War II that interest was renewed in the semiconductor. There
was a dire need for a device that could work within the ultra-high frequencies of radar. Electron tubes had
interelectrode capacitances that were too high to do the job. The point-contact semiconductor diode, on
the other hand, had a very low internal capacitance. Consequently, it filled the bill; it could be designed to
work within the ultra-high frequencies used in radar, whereas the electron tube could not.
