Characterization and simulation of distortion in a wide variety of electronic circuits (with and without feedback)
is presented in detail in Pederson and Mayaram [1991]. Also derivations for the simple analysis techniques are
provided  and  veriﬁed  using  SPICE2  simulations.  Algorithms  for  computer-aided  analysis  of  distortion  are
available in Weiner and Spina [1980], Nagel [1975], Roychowdhury [1989], and Kundert [1987]. Chapter 5 of
Kundert  [1995]  gives  valuable  information  on  use  of  Fourier  analysis  in  SPICE  for  distortion  calculation  in
circuits.  The  software  packages  SPICE2,  SPICE3  and  SPECTRE  are  available  from  EECS  Industrial  Liaison
