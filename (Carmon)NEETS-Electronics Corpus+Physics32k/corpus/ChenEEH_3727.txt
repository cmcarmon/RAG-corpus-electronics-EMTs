where ‘‘’’ indicates the rule (usually addition or multipli-
cation) for combining these costs. This total cost is ﬁrst-order
Markovian in its dependence on the immediate predecessor
node only. The distance measure d is ordinarily a non-negative
quantity, and any transition originating at (0,0) is usually
costless. Let us further deﬁne the notation:
(i0, j0) ! (iN , jN ) : best path (in the sense of optimal cost)
