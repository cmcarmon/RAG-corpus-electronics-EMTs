Because we know R1//R2 and R3//R4 are parallel resistor equivalents, and we know that
voltage drops in parallel circuits are the same, we can transfer the respective voltage drops to
the appropriate columns on the table for those individual resistors. In other words, we take
another step backwards in our drawing sequence to the original conÔ¨Åguration, and complete
the table accordingly:
