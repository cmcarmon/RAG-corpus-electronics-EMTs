In Octave, enter the coefﬁcients into the A matrix with column elements comma separated,
and rows semicolon separated. Enter the voltages into the column vector b. Solve for the
unknown currents: I1, I2, and I3 with the command: x=A\b. These currents are contained
within the x column vector. The positive values indicate that the three mesh currents all ﬂow
in the assumed counterclockwise direction.
