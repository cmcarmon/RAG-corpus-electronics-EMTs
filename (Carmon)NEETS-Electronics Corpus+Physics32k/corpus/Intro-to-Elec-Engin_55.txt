While Coulomb’s law has to do with the electric force associated with two charged bodies,
Ampere’s law of force is concerned with magnetic forces associated with two loops of wire carrying
currents by virtue of the motion of charges in the loops. Note that isolated current elements do
not exist without sources and sinks of charges at their ends; magnetic monopoles do not exist.
Figure 1.1.2 shows two loops of wire in freespace carrying currents I1 and I2.
Considering a differential element d¯l1 of loop 1 and a differential element d¯l2 of loop 2,
the differential magnetic forces d ¯F21 and d ¯F12 experienced by the differential current elements
I1 d¯l1, and I2 d¯l2, due to I2 and I1, respectively, are given by
