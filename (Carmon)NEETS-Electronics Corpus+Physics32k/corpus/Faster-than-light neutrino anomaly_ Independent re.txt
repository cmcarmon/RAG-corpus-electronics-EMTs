In March 2012, the co-located ICARUS experiment refuted the OPERA results by measuring neutrino velocity to be that of light. ICARUS measured speed for seven neutrinos in the same short-pulse beam OPERA had checked in November 2011, and found them, on average, traveling at the speed of light. The results were from a trial run of neutrino-velocity measurements slated for May.
In May 2012, a new bunched beam rerun was initiated by CERN. Then in June 2012, it was announced by CERN that the four Gran Sasso experiments OPERA, ICARUS, LVD, and BOREXINO measured neutrino speeds consistent with the speed of light, indicating that the initial OPERA result was due to equipment errors.
In addition, Fermilab stated that the detectors for the MINOS project were being upgraded,. Fermilab scientists closely analyzed and placed bounds on the errors in their timing system.  In June 8, 2012 MINOS announced that according to preliminary results, the neutrino speed is consistent with the speed of light.
