As shown in Fig. 74.6, the system noise temperature is developed from the standard formula for the equivalent
temperature of tandem elements including the antenna in clear sky, propagation (rain) loss of A = 10log(a) dB,
circuit losses between the aperture and receiver of Lc dB, and receiver noise ﬁgure of F dB (corresponding to
receiver noise temperature Tr K). The system noise temperature referred to the antenna aperture is approximated
by the following equation where Train » 280 K is a reasonable approximation for the physical temperature of
the rain [Pratt and Bostian, 1986, p. 342]:
