After  completion  of  this  ﬁrst  ﬁeld  scan,  at  the  midpoint  of  the  last  line,  the  beam  again  is  blanked  as  it
returns to the top center of the target where the process is repeated to provide a second ﬁeld scan. The spot
size of the beam as it impinges upon the target must be ﬁne enough to leave unscanned areas between lines
for the second scan. The pattern of scanning lines covering the area of the target, or the screen of a picture
display, is called a raster.
