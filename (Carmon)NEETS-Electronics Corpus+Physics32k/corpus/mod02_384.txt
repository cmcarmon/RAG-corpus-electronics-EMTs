In the foregoing explanations and problems, the sides of triangles were given in inches, feet, and
units. In applying trigonometry to a-c circuit problems, these units of measure will be replaced by such
values given in ohms, amperes, volts, and watts. Angle ï¿½will be the phase angle between (source) voltage
and circuit current. However, the solution of these a-c problems is accomplished in exactly the same
manner as the foregoing problems. Only the units and some terminology are changed.
