m o s f e t a m p l i f i e r In this example, we examine the small-signal behavior
of the MOSFET amplifier shown in Figure 7.46 and studied in Example 7.12. This
amplifier works well for both positive and negative values of v IN, and so we will choose
the input bias voltage to be VIN = 0 V for the small-signal analysis. Therefore
