The decision to use a common logical link control (LLC) sublayer for all of the LAN protocols apparently
ushered in the idea of adaption sublayers. The reason for splitting the layer is simple: a user of the data link
control (DLC) layer need not know what kind of medium provides the communications; all that is necessary
is that the user understand the interface to the DLC layer.
