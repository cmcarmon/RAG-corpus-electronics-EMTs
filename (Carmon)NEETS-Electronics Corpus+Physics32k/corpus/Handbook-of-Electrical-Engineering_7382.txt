A self-contained FM radio transmitter is attached to the transmission line at a point adjacent to a strain gauge.
All remain at the same electrical potential as the line, much like a bird sitting safely on the wire, transmitting
the strain gauge output to a radio receiver and recorder located at some convenient point on the ground, where
vibration analysis can be made. As a result, armor rods may be placed around the line at the vulnerable points,
or vibration absorbers of the correct resonant frequency can be installed at the proper points on the line.
