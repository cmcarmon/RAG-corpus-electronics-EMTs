In explaining this NONLINEAR portion of the curve, letâ€™s go back just a bit to electron emission.
The electrons emitted by a cathode form a cloud around the cathode. This cloud is called the SPACE
CHARGE. The closer the space charge is to the cathode, the more densely packed it is with electrons. In
our example, the lower plate voltages (0-150 volts) over this part of the curve exert a pull on only the
outer fringe of the space charge where there are few electrons. This results in relatively few electrons
flowing to the plate.
