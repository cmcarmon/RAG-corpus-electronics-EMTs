In hydrogen saturated hydrochloric acid, the shiny platinum electrode is observed to assume positive potential versus that of platinum black at zero net current (+ 340 mV at room temperature). With the temperature increasing to 70 Â°C, the difference in potentials dropped to zero. The reason for this is not perfectly clear, although several explanations have been proposed.
