The improved version of the Sawyer Tower (Fig. 49.6) circuit allows us to cancel Co and Rd and the losses,
thus  determining  the  active  component.  This  is  important  in  the  development  of  materials  for  ferroelectric
memory  applications.  It  is  far  easier  to  judge  the  squareness  of  the  loop  when  the  inactive  components  are
canceled. Also, by calibrating the “magnitude controls” the value of the inactive components can be read off
directly. In typical measurements the resonance is far above the frequencies used, so ignoring the inductance
in the equivalent circuit is justiﬁed.
