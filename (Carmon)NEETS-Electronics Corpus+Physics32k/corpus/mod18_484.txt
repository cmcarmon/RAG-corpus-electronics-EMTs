Receiver bandwidth is defined as the frequency spread between the half-power points on the receiver 
response curve. Receiver bandwidth is specified for each radar, but wide variations are often tolerated. If 
either the bandwidth or the shape of the receiver response curve is not within tolerances, a detailed check 
of circuit components may be necessary. A considerable change in the value of circuit components is 
required to alter the response. You should check receiver response after any extensive repair to an IF 
amplifier.
