One of the major problems we face in using a digital computer is communicating with it. We must 
have one or more ways of getting data into the computer to be processed. You learned in chapter 2 that 
there are several types of input devices that read data into a computer. But how does one prepare the data 
to be used as input? How do we convert human-readable documents into a computer-readable form, and 
what type of input media do we use? If the data is to be used by another computer some distance away, 
how do we transmit it? Well, as you probably suspect, there are several ways to perform this conversion 
and transmission process, and that is the chapter of our discussion.
