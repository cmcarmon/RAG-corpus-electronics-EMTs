Dynamic (non positive displacement) Pumps
This type is generally used for low-pressure, high volume flow applications. Since they are not capable of withstanding high pressures, there is little use in the fluid power field. Their maximum pressure is limited to 250-300 psi. This type of pump is primarily used for transporting fluids from one location to another. Centrifugal and axial flow propeller pumps are the two most common types of dynamic pumps.
Positive Displacement Pumps This type is universally used for fluid power systems. With this pump, a fixed amount of fluid is ejected into the hydraulic system per revolution of pump shaft rotation. These pumps are capable of overcoming the pressure resulting from the mechanical loads on the system as well as the resistance to flow due to friction. These two features are highly desirable in fluid power pumps. These pumps also have the following advantages over non positive displacement pumps:
High-pressure capability(up to 12,000 psi)
Small compact size
high volumetric efficiency
small changes in efficiency throughout the design pressure range
