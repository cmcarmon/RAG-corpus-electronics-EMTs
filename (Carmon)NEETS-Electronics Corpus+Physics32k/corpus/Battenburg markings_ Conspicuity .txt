The Battenburg design uses a regular pattern and the contrast between a light and a dark colour to increase conspicuity for the human eye. The lighter colour is daylight-fluorescent (such as fluorescent-yellow) for better visibility in daytime and particularly also in dusk and dawn. For night-time visibility, the complete pattern is retroreflective.
The Battenburg design typically has two rows of alternating rectangles, usually starting with yellow at the top corner, then the alternating colour, along the sides of a vehicle. Most cars use two block rows in the design (so-called full-Battenburg scheme). Some designs for cars only use a single row (so-called half-Battenburg scheme) or one and a half rows.
Pattern markings can have a camouflage effect as well concealing the outline of the vehicle, particularly in front of a cluttered background. For Battenburg markings, this can be avoided by the following means:
The pattern rectangles shall not be too small in order to allow for optical resolution from distance. The rectangle size shall be 600 x 300 mm at minimum. A typical car pattern consists of seven blocks along the vehicle side. (Additionally, an odd number of blocks allows for both top corner blocks to be in the same fluorescent colour)
The vehicle outline of a car shall be clearly marked out in fluorescent colour along the roof pillars
Designs with more than two block rows shall be avoided even for higher vehicles. Instead, large area of plain or daylight-fluorescent color can be used in combination.
Hybrid designs of Battenburg markings and other high-visibility patterns or check patterns shall be avoided.
The Battenburg livery is not used on the rear of vehicles, instead with the majority of users using upward facing chevrons in yellow and red to the rear, in line with the markings used by other road users.
