Computers are now employed wherever repeated calculations or the processing of huge amounts of
data is needed. The greatest applications are found in the military, scientific, and commercial fields. They
have applications that range from mail sorting, through engineering design, to the identification and
destruction of enemy targets. The advantages of digital computers include speed, accuracy, and man-
power savings. Often computers are able to take over routine jobs and release personnel for more
important workÂ¾ work that cannot be handled by a computer.
