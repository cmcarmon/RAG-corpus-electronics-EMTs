The gravitational force is directed downwards and is equal to

{\displaystyle F_{\text{G}}=mg,}

where m is the mass of the ball, and g is the gravitational acceleration, which on Earth varies between 9.764 m/s2 and 9.834 m/s2. Because the other forces are usually small, the motion is often idealized as being only under the influence of gravity. If only the force of gravity acts on the ball, the mechanical energy will be conserved during its flight. In this idealized case, the equations of motion are given by

where a, v, and r denote the acceleration, velocity, and position of the ball, and v0 and r0 are the initial velocity and position of the ball, respectively.
More specifically, if the ball is bounced at an angle θ with the ground, the motion in the x- and y-axes (representing horizontal and vertical motion, respectively) is described by
The equations imply that the maximum height (H) and range (R) and time of flight (T) of a ball bouncing on a flat surface are given by

Further refinements to the motion of the ball can be made by taking into account air resistance (and related effects such as drag and wind), the Magnus effect, and buoyancy. Because lighter balls accelerate more readily, their motion tends to be affected more by such forces.
