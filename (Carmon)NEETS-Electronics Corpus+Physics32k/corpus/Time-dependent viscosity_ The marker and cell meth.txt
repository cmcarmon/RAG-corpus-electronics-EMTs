A technique is described for the numerical investigation of time-dependent flow of an incompressible fluid, of which is partially confined and partially free. The full Navierâ€“Stokes equations are written in finite-difference form, and the solution is accomplished by finite-time-step advancement. The primary dependent variables are the pressure and the velocity components. Also used is a set of marker particles which move with the fluid.
