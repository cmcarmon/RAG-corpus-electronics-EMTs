and an index of 3. Special names are used when the 
indices  are  2  and  3,  these  being  called  ‘squared’ 
and ‘cubed’, respectively.  Thus 72 is called ‘seven 
squared’  and  93 is  called  ‘nine  cubed’.    When  no 
index is shown, the power is 1, i.e. 21 means 2. 
 
Reciprocals 
 
The reciprocal of a number is when the index is –1 
and  its  value  is  given  by  1  divided  by  the  base.  
Thus the reciprocal of 2 is 2–1 and its value is ½ or 
0.5.    Similarly,  the  reciprocal  of  4  is  4–1  which 
means ¼ or 0.25. 
 
Square roots 
 
The square root of a number is when the index is 
½. The square root of 2 is written as 2½ or Ö2.  The 
value of a square root is the value of the base which 
when multiplied by itself gives the number.  Since 
3 ´ 3 = 9, then Ö9 = 3.  However, (-3) ´ (-3) = 9, so 
we have a second possibility, i.e. Ö9 = ±3.  There 
are  always  two  answers  when  finding  the  square 
root  of  a  number  and  we  can  indicate  this  is  by 
placing a ± sign in front of the result meaning ‘plus 
or minus’. Thus:
