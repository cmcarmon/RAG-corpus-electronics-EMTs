For frequencies of 0.3 to 3 MHz, in the MF band, ground-wave (or surface-wave) propagation,
illustrated in Figure 15.0.2, is the dominant mode used for AM broadcasting and maritime radio
broadcasting. Dominant disturbances include atmospheric noise, human-made noise, and thermal
noise from electronic components. The range is limited to about 100 miles for even the more
powerful radio stations.
