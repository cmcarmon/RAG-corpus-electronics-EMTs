A digital technology, which emerged in the United States in the late 1980s, was time division multiple access
(TDMA). TDMA systems took advantage of time multiplexing different users into the same 30-kHz channel,
which was used by AMPS. The IS-54 public wireless standard introduces the concept of three-slot TDMA, in
which three users were time multiplexed into a single 30-kHz channel. This has the effect of tripling the effective
capacity of an AMPS network; therefore, sometimes TDMA is referred to as D-AMPS, for digital AMPS. The
Ô¨Årst commercial TDMA system to be launched in the United States was in 1991. The IS-136 standard, which
