There  is,  therefore,  an  identiﬁed  need  for  matrix  environments  to  provide  a  wider  range  of  data  types,
preferably user deﬁnable. These would be used in the same way as record datatypes are used in conventional
programming systems and would be considerably safer to use since the types expected and returned by functions
could be speciﬁed in advance and the scope for misuse would be much reduced. In addition, the need to invent
new  types  for  each  application  would  be  somewhat  reduced.  This  approach  has  been  taken  in  the  matrix
environment  X-Math  and  similar  features  are  planned  for  a  future  release  of  MATLAB.  Some  of  the  other
requirements listed above, such as graphical systems input, graphical display of results, and spreadsheet data
manipulation, are covered to a greater or lesser extent by the current generation of matrix environments. The
others, namely symbolic data processing and database support, are not but are considered to be outside the
scope of this article.
