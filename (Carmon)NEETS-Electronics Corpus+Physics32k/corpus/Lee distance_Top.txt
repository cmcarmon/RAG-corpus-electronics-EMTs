In coding theory, the Lee distance is a distance between two strings

…

x

n




{\displaystyle x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n}}
and




y

1



y

…

n




{\displaystyle y_{1}y_{2}\dots y_{n}}
of equal length n over the q-ary alphabet {0, 1, …, q − 1} of size q ≥ 2. It is a metric, defined as

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}\min(|x_{i}-y_{i}|,q-|x_{i}-y_{i}|).}

Considering the alphabet as the additive group Zq, the Lee distance between two single letters



x


{\displaystyle x}
and



y


{\displaystyle y}
is the length of shortest path in the Cayley graph (which is circular since the group is cyclic) between them.
If



q
=
2


{\displaystyle q=2}
or



q
=
3


{\displaystyle q=3}
the Lee distance coincides with the Hamming distance, because both distances are 0 for two single equal symbols and 1 for two single non-equal symbols. For



q
>
3


{\displaystyle q>3}
this is not the case anymore, the Lee distance can become bigger than 1.
The metric space induced by the Lee distance is a discrete analog of the elliptic space.
