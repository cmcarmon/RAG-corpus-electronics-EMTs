Invariants are important in modern theoretical physics, and many theories are expressed in terms of their symmetries and invariants. Noether's theorem states that every differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law.
Covariance and contravariance generalize the mathematical properties of invariance in tensor mathematics, and are frequently used in electromagnetism, special relativity, and general relativity.
