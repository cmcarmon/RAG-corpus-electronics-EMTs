Text is the most popular of all the media types. It is distributed
over the Internet in many forms, including ﬁles or messages
using different transfer protocols such as File Transfer Protocol
(FTP), which is used to transfer binary and ASCII ﬁles over the
Internet; Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is used
to transmit HTML pages; or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP), which is used for exchanging e-mails. Text is repre-
sented in binary as 7-bit US-ASCII, 8-bit ISO-8859, 16-bit
Unicode, or 32-bit ISO 10646 character sets, depending on
the language of choice and the country of origin. Bandwidth
requirements of text media mainly depend on their size, which
can be easily reduced using common compression schemes
(Salomon, 1998) as detailed by Table 7.1.
