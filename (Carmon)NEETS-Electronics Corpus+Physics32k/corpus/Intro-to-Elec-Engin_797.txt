CMOS NAND and NOR gates with two inputs are shown in Figure 9.3.5. For the NAND
gate of Figure 9.3.5(a), if at least one input is in the low state, the associated PMOS device will
be on and the NMOS device will be off, thereby yielding a high output state. If, on the other
hand, both VA and VB are high, both PMOS devices will be off while both NMOS devices will
be on, thereby giving a low output Vout. Thus, the CMOS device of Figure 9.3.5(a) functions as
a NAND gate.
