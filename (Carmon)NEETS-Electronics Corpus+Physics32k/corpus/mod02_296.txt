In a purely resistive circuit all of the power is consumed and none is returned to the source; in a 
purely reactive circuit no power is consumed and all of the power is returned to the source. It follows that 
in a circuit which contains both resistance and reactance there must be some power dissipated in the 
resistance as well as some returned to the source by the reactance. In figure 4-9 you can see the 
relationship between the voltage, the current, and the power in such a circuit. The part of the power curve 
which is shown below the horizontal reference line is the result of multiplying a positive instantaneous
