Since we know that the inductor current cannot change its value instantaneously, as otherwise
the inductor voltage vL (t ) = L diL/dt would become inÔ¨Ånite, it follows that the inductor current
immediately after closing the switch, iL(0
), must be the same as the inductor current just before
closing the switch, iL(0
) = iL(0
