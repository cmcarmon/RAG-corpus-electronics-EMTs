Anywhere on Earth (AoE) is a calendar designation which indicates that a period expires when the date passes everywhere on Earth. The last place on Earth where any date exists is on Howland and Baker islands, in the IDLW time zone (the West side of the International Date Line), and so is the last spot on the globe for any day to exist. Therefore, the day ends AoE when it ends on Howland Island.
The convention originated in IEEE 802.16 balloting procedures. At this point, many IEEE 802 ballot deadlines are established as the end of day using "AoE", for "Anywhere on Earth" as a designation. This means that the deadline has not passed if, anywhere on Earth, the deadline date has not yet passed.
Note that the day's end AoE occurs at noon Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of the following day, Howland and Baker islands being halfway around the world from the prime meridian that is the base reference longitude for UTC.
Thus, in standard notation this is:
UTCâˆ’12:00 hour
Daylight Saving Time: DST is not applied, nor applicable
