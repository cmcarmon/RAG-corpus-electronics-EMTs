After  the  printed  circuit  board  is  completely 
 assembled and soldered, apply power. If the circuit 
works properly, enjoy. Otherwise, troubleshoot by 
first removing power from the printed circuit board. 
Inspect all traces for bridging or breaks and all solder 
 connections for shorts. Check for improper solder 
connections. Correct all problems and retest.
