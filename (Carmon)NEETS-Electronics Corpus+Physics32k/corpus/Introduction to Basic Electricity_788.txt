 outputs and can produce Excellon files for 
 numerically control drill machines. It can  generate 
files for third-party software so PCBs can be 
 machined without the need for chemical etching. 
It also produces Gerber files for professional board 
manufacture.
Circuit Wizard can also produce a Bill of Materials 
spreadsheet (Figure 6-5). The spreadsheet contains the 
component properties assigned in the design. Circuit 
Wizard allows custom formatting of the spreadsheet, 
and it is possible to produce totals in order to deter-
mine the cost of producing a PCB.
