A word	processor is used to capture keystrokes 
(enter text) and edit text, which also includes spelling 
and grammar checking. A person using a word pro-
cessor is word processing and is able to format specific 
elements into the text, which leads to reducing the 
formatting time when the text is imported into a page 
layout program. Word processors provide a wide vari-
ety of templates for use in special formatting.
