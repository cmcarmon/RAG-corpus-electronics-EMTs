Learning to communicate effectively is a lifelong task you should
always  work  toward.  The  best  time  to  begin  is  while  still  in  school.
Continually look for opportunities to develop and strengthen your read-
ing,  writing,  listening,  and  speaking  skills.  You  can  do  this  through
classroom  presentations,  team  projects,  active  participation  in  student
organizations, and enrollment in communication courses. The risks are
less now than later in the workplace.
