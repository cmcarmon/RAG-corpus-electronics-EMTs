Since air is an insulating material, and an air gap separates the two pieces of wire, the once-
continuous path has now been broken, and electrons cannot ﬂow from Source to Destination.
This is like cutting a water pipe in two and capping off the broken ends of the pipe: water
can’t ﬂow if there’s no exit out of the pipe. In electrical terms, we had a condition of electrical
continuity when the wire was in one piece, and now that continuity is broken with the wire cut
and separated.
