In the general case, more than one level of data reuse buffers
is possible for each signal (see Section 2.4.2 for an example).
We have developed a formal methodology (Wuytack et al.,
1998) for which all possible buffers are arranged in a tree.
For each signal, such a tree is generated, and an optimal
alternative is selected.
