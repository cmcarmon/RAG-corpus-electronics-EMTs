When a material undergoes a phase change from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas the thermal conductivity may change. An example of this would be the change in thermal conductivity that occurs when ice (thermal conductivity of 2.18 W/(m⋅K) at 0 °C) melts to form liquid water (thermal conductivity of 0.56 W/(m⋅K) at 0 °C).
