Very soon after some types of bone injury and pathology were ﬁrst treated with PEMF, the effects of PEMF
on peripheral nerve regeneration became subjects of investigation. Improved neural function that appeared as
an  unintended  “side  effect”  in  the  clinical  treatment  of  nonunions  led  Kort  et al.  [1980]  to  a  systematic
investigation of PEMF effects on neural regeneration in rats. Other investigators employed other animal models
and also compared PEMF with direct current as agents for neural regeneration. More recent work [Siskin et al.,
1990]  employed  a  PEMF  signal  consisting  of  20-ms  pulses  at  a  repetition  rate  of  2  pulses  per  second  with
exponential rise and decay times of, respectively, 0.5 and 1 ms. Amplitudes were 0.3 mT for experiments with
crush lesions of the sciatic nerve in rats and 0.05 mT for stimulation in vitro of neurite outgrowth in dorsal
root ganglia. Estimated values for the mean induced electric ﬁeld pulses were 5 mV/m in the animal experiments
and 0.7 mV/m in the 60-mm-diameter culture dishes of the in vitro work. Stimulation for 2 h per day of the
in vitro cultures produced approximately 50% enhancement of neurite outgrowth in comparison with controls
after 2 days.
