Targets can be resolved in range, azimuth cross-range, eleva-
tion cross-range, and Doppler. Resolution represents the
smallest separation between two quantities that the radar can
distinguish. Range resolution is a function of the transmitted
waveform and is inversely proportional to the signal band-
width. The resolution can be expressed by:
