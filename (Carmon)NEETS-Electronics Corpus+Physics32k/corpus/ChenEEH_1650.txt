on the other hand, is more generic for a variety of audio–visual
coding applications. It has to have the error resilience for
broadcasting and ATM networks. The aim of MPEG-2 is
to produce broadcast-quality video compression and sup-
port higher resolutions including high deﬁnition television
(HDTV).2 MPEG-2 supports
low
(352  240), main (720  480), high-1440 (1440  1152),
and high (1920  1080) (ISO/IEC, 1994). The MPEG-2 com-
pressed video data rates are in the range of 3 to 100 Mbps.3
Although the principles used to encode MPEG-2 are very
similar to MPEG-1, they provide much greater ﬂexibility by
offering several proﬁles that differ in the presence or absence of
B-pictures, chrominance resolution, and coded stream scal-
ability.4 MPEG-2 supports both progressive and interlaced
modes.5 Signiﬁcant improvements have also been introduced
in the MPEG-2 system level. The MPEG-2 systems layer is
responsible for the integration and synchronization of the
elementary streams (ES): audio and video streams as well as
an unlimited number of data and control streams that can be
used for various applications such as subtitles in multiple
languages. This is accomplished by ﬁrst packetizing the ES,
thus forming the packetized elementary streams (PES). These
PES contain timestamps from a system clock for synchroniza-
tion. The PES are subsequently multiplexed to form a single
output stream for transmission in one of two modes: program
stream (PS) and transport stream (TS). The PS is provided for
error-free environments, such as storage in a CD-ROM. They
are used for multiplexing PES that share a common time base,
using long variable-length packets.6 The TS is designed for
noisy environments, such as communication over ATM net-
works. This mode permits multiplexing streams (PES and PS),
which do not necessarily share a common time-base, using
ﬁxed-length (188 bytes) packets.
