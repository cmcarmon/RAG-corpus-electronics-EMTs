The magnetic force surrounding a magnet is not uniform. There exists a great concentration of force
at each end of the magnet and a very weak force at the center. Proof of this fact can be obtained by
dipping a magnet into iron filings (fig. 1-8). It is found that many filings will cling to the ends of the
magnet while very few adhere to the center. The two ends, which are the regions of concentrated lines of
force, are called the POLES of the magnet. Magnets have two magnetic poles and both poles have equal
magnetic strength.
