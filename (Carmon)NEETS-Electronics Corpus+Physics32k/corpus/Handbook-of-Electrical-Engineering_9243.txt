been published, and anecdotal results indicate efﬁciency levels of less than 30%. To date there is no empirical
evidence that software where correctness proofs were used actually achieves lower defect rates in the ﬁeld than
software not using such proofs. Also, the number of correctness proofs which are themselves in error appears
to constitute an alarming percentage, perhaps more than half, of all proofs attempted.
