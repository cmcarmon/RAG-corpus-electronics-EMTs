Arrays can be described with respect to their radiation patterns and the types of elements of which 
they are made. However, you will find it useful to identify them by the physical placement of the 
elements and the direction of radiation with respect to these elements. Generally speaking, the term 
BROADSIDE ARRAY designates an array in which the direction of maximum radiation is perpendicular 
to the plane containing these elements. In actual practice, this term is confined to those arrays in which 
the elements themselves are also broadside, or parallel, with respect to each other.
