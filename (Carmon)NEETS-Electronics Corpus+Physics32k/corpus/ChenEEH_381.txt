If we compare the denominator of equation 4.9a with a pole-
pair factor in equation 4.3, we notice that the pole frequency is
implemented as v0i ¼ 1=t ¼ 1=(RC), and the pole quality
factor is Qi ¼ 1=q ¼ Rq=R. Clearly, we may choose Rq larger
than R, so that Qi > 1 and the poles are complex. In addition,
a band-pass function is realized at the output VB because
according to Figure 4.3, we have VB ¼ stVL to give with
equation 4.9a:
