Under Australian law, a driver involved in a crash must stop at the scene and give their information to all other drivers involved and anyone injured, as well as the owner and driver of any property damaged, and a police officer if:
Anyone is killed or injured;
A vehicle involved in the crash is towed or otherwise carried away from the crash by another vehicle;
Any other driver involved in the crash does not stop to exchange information;
A police officer asks for any of the information.
The demerit point system is used for the commission of traffic offenses in Australia; for each offense committed, a certain number of points are given, and the accumulation of points can lead to fines and license suspension or revocation. When a driver fails to stop at the scene and provide the required information to the necessary people, he or she is guilty of a hit and run, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 points.
