▶✓ Temperature: For most materials, the higher the temperature, the 
higher the resistance. Higher temperatures mean that the particles 
inside have more energy, so they bump into each other a lot more, slow­
ing down the flow of electrons. One notable exception to this is a type 
of resistor called a thermistor: Increase the temperature of a thermistor, 
and it lowers its resistance in a predictable way. (You can imagine how 
useful that characteristic is in temperature‐sensing circuits.) You can 
read about thermistors in Chapter 12.
