The IF section receives the final IF signal and uses it to establish the system resolution by using
selective filtering. System resolution is selected under microcomputer control among five bandwidths (1
MHz, 100 kHz, 10 kHz, 1 kHz, and 100 Hz). The gain for all bands are then leveled and logarithmically
amplified. This is done so that each division of signal change on the CRT display remains equal in change
to every other division on the CRT. For example, in the 10-dB-per-division mode, each division of
change is equal to a 10 dB difference, regardless of whether the signal appears at the top or bottom of the
CRT. The signal needed to produce the video output to the display section is then detected and provided.
