Radio and Television Broadcasting
Radio (AM and FM) and television broadcasting are the most familiar forms of communication
via analog transmission systems. The receiver most commonly used in AM radio broadcasting is
the superheterodyne receiver, shown in Figure 15.2.20, which consists of a radio-frequency (RF)
tuned ampliﬁer, mixer, local oscillator, intermediate frequency (IF) ampliﬁer, envelope detector,
audio-frequency ampliﬁer, and a loudspeaker. Tuning at the desired radio frequency fc is achieved
by a variable capacitor, which simultaneously tunes the RF ampliﬁer and the frequency f LO of the
local oscillator. Every AM radio signal, in a superheterodyne receiver, is converted to a common IF
frequency of fIF = |fc − fLO| = 455 kHz, which allows the use of a single tuned IF ampliﬁer for
signals from any radio station in the frequency band. Matching the bandwidth of the transmitted
signal, the IF ampliﬁer is set to have a bandwidth of 10 kHz.
