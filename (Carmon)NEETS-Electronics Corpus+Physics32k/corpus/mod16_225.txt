Before power is applied, R1 and R2 in view A of figure 2-4 are used to adjust the current through
RT-2. When the resistance of RT-2 reaches the equivalent parallel resistance of R6 and RT1 (122.4
ohms), the bridge is balanced. Meter M-1 reads 0 at this time. The rf signal being measured is connected
to the test set and applied via the calibrated attenuator to RT-2. This causes the temperature of RT-2 to
increase, thus reducing its resistance. The bridge becomes unbalanced, causing meter M-1 to deflect an
amount proportional to the decrease in resistance of RT-2. Meter M-1, because of the operation of RT-2,
reads average power.
