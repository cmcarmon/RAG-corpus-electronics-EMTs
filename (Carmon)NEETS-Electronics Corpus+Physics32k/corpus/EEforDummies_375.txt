At the same time, the positive terminal of the battery attracts electrons from 
the other capacitor plate, so they begin to move. As they pass through the 
light bulb, they light it (but only for a split second, which I explain in the 
next paragraph). A net positive charge (due to a deficiency of electrons) is 
produced on that plate. With a net negative charge on one plate, and a net 
positive charge on the other plate, the result is a voltage difference across 
the two plates. This voltage difference represents the electrical energy stored 
in the capacitor.
