Power for a circuit can come from an alternating current (AC) source, such 
as the 120 VAC (volts AC) outlet in your house or office (line power), or a 
direct current (DC) source, such as a battery or the low‐voltage output from a 
wall transformer. DC supplies can be positive or negative with respect to the 
zero‐volt reference (known as common ground, or simply common) in a circuit. 
Figure 14-4 shows various symbols used to represent power and ground con-
nections. These symbols are discussed more fully in the next two subsections.
