For FM, vertical layering of moisture content and temperature in the atmosphere (inversion layers) can occasionally cause signals to travel hundreds or thousands of kilometres further than usual. An inversion layer (or duct) is most commonly observed over high pressure regions and may affect radio signals for several hours to several days. The phenomenon is commonly referred to as anomalous propagation and is more likely in hot, dry weather in late summer.
