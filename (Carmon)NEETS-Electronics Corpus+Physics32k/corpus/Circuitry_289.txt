Rectifiers 
 
Semiconductor  diodes 
(see  Chapter  5)  are 
commonly used to convert alternating current (a.c.) 
to  direct  current  (d.c),  in  which  case  they  are 
referred  to  as  rectifiers. The  simplest  form  of 
rectifier  circuit  makes  use  of  a  single  diode  and, 
since it operates on only either positive or negative 
half-cycles  of  the  supply,  it  is  known  as  a  half-
wave rectifier.  
  Figure  6.4  shows  a  simple  half-wave  rectifier 
circuit. Mains voltage (220 to 240 V) is applied to 
the  primary  of  a  step-down  transformer  (T1).  The 
secondary  of  T1  steps  down  the  240  V  r.m.s.  to  
12  V  r.m.s.  (the  turns  ratio  of  T1  will  thus  be 
240/12  or  20:1).  Diode  D1  will  only  allow  the 
current  to  flow  in  the  direction  shown  (i.e.  from 
cathode  to  anode).  D1  will  be  forward  biased 
during  each  positive  half-cycle 
to 
common) and will effectively behave like a closed 
switch. When the circuit current tries to flow in the 
opposite direction, the voltage bias across the diode 
will  be  reversed,  causing  the  diode  to  act  like  an 
open 
switch 
(see  Figs  6.5(a)  and  6.5(b), 
respectively).  
  The switching action of D1 results in a pulsating 
output  voltage  which  is  developed  across  the  load 
resistor  (RL). Since  the  mains  supply  is  at  50  Hz, 
the pulses of voltage developed across RL will also 
be  at  50  Hz  even  if  only  half  the  a.c.  cycle  is 
present.  During  the  positive  half-cycle,  the  diode 
will  drop  the  0.6  V  to  0.7  V  forward  threshold 
voltage  normally  associated  with  silicon  diodes. 
However,  during  the  negative  half-cycle  the  peak 
a.c.  voltage  will  be  dropped  across  D1  when  it  is 
reverse  biased.  This  is  an  important  consideration
