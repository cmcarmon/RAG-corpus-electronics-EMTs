However, the longer the wire, the greater the 
resistance — especially if the wire has a small 
diameter. Usually, the larger the wire, the lower 
its resistance per foot. Even though the meter 
doesn’t  read  exactly  0  Ω,  you  can  assume 
proper continuity in this instance if you get a 
low ohms reading.
