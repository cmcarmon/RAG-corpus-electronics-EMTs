Search performance is basically determined by the capability of the radar system to detect a target of speciﬁc
RCS at a given maximum detection range while scanning a given solid angle extent within a speciﬁed period

R
 can be set to the maximum required target detection range, Rmax. Manipulation of the radar range equation
results in the following expression:
