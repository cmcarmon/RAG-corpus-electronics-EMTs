Applications: DC Transistor Circuits
Most  of  us  deal  with  electronic  products  on  a  routine  basis  and  have
some  experience  with  personal  computers.  A basic  component  for
the integrated  circuits  found  in  these  electronics  and  computers  is  the
active,  three-terminal  device  known  as  the  transistor. Understanding
the transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic cir-
cuit design.
