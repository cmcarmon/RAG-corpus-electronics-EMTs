Next, following the second step of incremental analysis we draw the incremental sub-
circuit in Figure 4.44c. This time around, we set the DC source to zero, and replace the
nonlinear resistor with a linear resistor of value rd.
We can now find the incremental values id, vo from Figure 4.44c if we know the value of
rd. Accordingly, we first determine the value of rd. We know from Equation 4.71 that
