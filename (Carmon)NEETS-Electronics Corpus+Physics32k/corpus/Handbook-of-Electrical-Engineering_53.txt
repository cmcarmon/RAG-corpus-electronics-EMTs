Varistors. Varistors  are  voltage-dependent  resistors  that  show  a  high  degree  of  nonlinearity  between  their
resistance  value  and  applied  voltage.  They  are  composed  of  a  nonhomogeneous  material  that  provides  a
rectifying action. Varistors are used for protection of electronic circuits, semiconductor components, collectors
of motors, and relay contacts against overvoltage.
