b) Extend your result in part (a) to two dimensions; that is, devise a new network (which
will have more voltage sources and more resistors than above) that can find the center
of mass of a triangle with arbitrary weights handing from its three corners. The
network will now have to give you two voltages, one representing the x-coordinate
and the other the y-coordinate of the center of mass. This system is a barycentric
coordinate calculator, and can be used as the input for video games, or to simulate
trichromatic color vision in the human eye.
