Synchros are also designed to operate on a 60- or 400-Hz frequency.  But like transformers, they are 
more efficient at the higher frequency.  Operating a synchro at a higher frequency also permits it to be 
made physically smaller. This is because the lines of flux produced by the 400-Hz excitation voltage are 
much more concentrated than those produced by the 60-Hz excitation voltage. Hence, the core of the 400-
Hz synchro can be made smaller than the core of the 60-Hz synchro. However, some 400-Hz synchro 
units are identical in size to their 60-Hz counterparts. This is done so that 60- and 400-Hz units can be 
physically interchanged without special mounting provisions.  The operating voltage and frequency of 
each synchro is marked on its nameplate.
