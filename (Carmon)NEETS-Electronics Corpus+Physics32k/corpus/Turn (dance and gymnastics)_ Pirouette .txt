A pirouette (literally "whirl") is a type of dance turn on one foot. It is performed with turnout (legs rotated outward at hips) in ballet, and typically without turnout in gymnastics and many other genres of dance, such as jazz and modern. It is often executed by starting with one or both legs in plié (knees bent) and then rising onto demi pointe (heels raised) as the turn commences, or in the case of ballerinas, to en pointe (on toe tips). Pirouettes may be executed singly or as multiple rotations; the latter is commonly performed in the adagio part of a grand pas de deux.
There are many variations of pirouettes. A pirouette can be started from second or fourth position in ballet, whereas artistic gymnasts usually start from fourth position. In ballet, the non-supporting leg can be held in retiré position or in attitude , arabesque level, or second position. The performer may return to the starting position, finish in arabesque or attitude, or proceed otherwise. A pirouette is most often en dehors but can also be en dedans.
