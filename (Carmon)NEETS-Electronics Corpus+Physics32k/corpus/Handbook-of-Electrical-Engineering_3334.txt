Image Dissector Tube
The image dissector tube is a photosensitive device which uses an electron deﬂection lens to image the electron
from the cathode onto a pinhole in front of an electron multiplier. The image can be deﬂected around in front
of  the  pinhole  in  a  random  access  manner.  The  primary  application  of  this  kind  of  device  is  for  tracking
purposes.
