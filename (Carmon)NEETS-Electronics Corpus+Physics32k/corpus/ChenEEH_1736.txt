maps, gray-scale or colored images, and photographs as well
as animation, simulation, virtual reality objects, and video
conferencing and teleconferencing. The sound material may
include telephone/broadcast-quality speech to represent voice,
wideband audio for music reproduction, and recordings of
sounds such as from electrocardiograms or other biomedical
signals. Other perceptory senses, such as touch and smell, can
very well be considered as part of multimedia but are con-
sidered out of scope of this chapter.
