In reality, the generator voltage control for keeping the bus
voltage magnitude at a speciﬁed value becomes inactive when
the control is pushed to the extremes, such as when the reactive
output of the generator becomes either too high or too low. This
voltage control limitation of the generator can be represented in
power ﬂow studies by keeping track of the reactive output QGi.
When the reactive generation QGi becomes larger than a pre-
speciﬁed maximum value of QGi, max or goes lower than a
prespeciﬁed minimum value QGi, min, the reactive output is
assumed to be ﬁxed at the limiting value QGi, max or QGi, min,
respectively, and the voltage control is disabled in the formula-
tion; that is, the reactive power QGi becomes a known variable,
either at QGi, max or QGi, min, and the voltage Vi then becomes
the unknown variable for bus i. In power ﬂow terminology, we
say that the generator at bus i has ‘‘reached its reactive limits’’
and, hence, bus i has changed from a PV bus to a PQ bus. Owing
to space limitations, we will not discuss generator reactive limits
in any more detail in this section.
