COMPOUND-WOUND DC GENERATORS have both series field windings and shunt field 
windings. These generators combine the characteristics of series and shunt generators. The output voltage 
remains relatively constant for all values of load current within the design of the generator. Compound 
generators are used in many applications because of the relatively constant voltage.
