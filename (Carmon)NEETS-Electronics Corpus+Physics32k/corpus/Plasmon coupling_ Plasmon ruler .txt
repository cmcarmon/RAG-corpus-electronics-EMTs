Plasmon ruler refers to a dimer of two identical plasmonic nanospheres linked together through a polymer, typically DNA or RNA. Based on the Universal Scaling Law  between spectral shift and the interparticle separations, the nanometer scale distance can be monitored by the color shifts of dimer resonance peak. Plasmon rulers are typically used to monitor distance fluctuation below the diffraction limit, between tens of nanometers and a few nanometers.
