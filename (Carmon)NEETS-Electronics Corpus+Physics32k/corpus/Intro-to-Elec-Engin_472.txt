5.4.20 Addition and integration can be combined by the
summing integrator circuit shown in Figure
P5.4.20. With the given component values and
input waveforms, sketch vo when S is opened at
t = 0.
5.4.21 Refer to the noninverting ampliÔ¨Åer circuit of Fig-
ure 5.4.2. Let R1 = 10 k, R2 = 30 k, and vi
be a sinusoidal source with a peak value of 1 V.
Sketch the waveforms of vi and vo.
