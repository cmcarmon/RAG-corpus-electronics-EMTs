 7. Do not permit ESDS devices or assemblies to come in contact with clothing or other ungrounded
materials that could have an electrostatic charge. The charges on a nonconducting material are not
equal. A plastic storage bag may have a - 10,000 volt potential one-half inch from a +15,000 volt
potential, with many other such charges all over the bag. Placing a circuit card inside the bag
allows the charges to equalize through the pcb conductive paths and components, thereby causing
failures. Do not hand an ESDS device or assembly to another person until the device or assembly
is protectively packaged.
