Tuning Elements
In rectangular waveguide the basic adjustable tuning element is the sliding short shown in Fig. 39.7(a). Varying
the position of the short will change resonance frequencies of cavities. It can be combined with hybrid tees to
achieve  a  variety  of  tuning  functions.  The  post  in  Fig. 39.4(f)  can  be  replaced  by  a  screw  to  obtain  a  screw
tuner which is commonly used in waveguide ﬁlters. Sliding short circuits can be used in coaxial lines and in
conjunction  with  branching  elements  to  obtain  stub  tuners.  Coaxial  slug  tuners  are  also  used  to  provide
adjustable matching at the input and output of active circuits. The slug is movable and changes the characteristic
impedance of the transmission line. It is more difﬁcult to achieve variable tuning in passive microstrip circuits.
One solution is to provide a number of pads as shown in Fig. 39.7(c) which, in this case, can be bonded to the
stub to obtain an adjustable stub length. Variable amounts of phase shift can be inserted by using a variable
length of line called a line stretcher, or by a line with a variable propagation constant. One type of waveguide
variable phase shifter is similar to the variable attenuator of Fig. 39.5(d) with the resistive material replaced by
a low-loss dielectric.
