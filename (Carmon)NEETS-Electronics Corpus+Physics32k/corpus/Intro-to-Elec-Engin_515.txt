The minimum POS expression for a Boolean function can be obtained easily by using K
maps in a procedure very similar to that used for the minimum SOP expression. By using the 0s
of the map and obtaining prime implicants again by using the 0 cells, this can be done. Since the
0 cells represent the compliment of the function, complementing the minimum SOP expression
for the 0s of the function yields the minimum POS form of the function. Even though the two
forms (POS and SOP) are completely equivalent, logically, one of the two forms may lead to a
realization involving a smaller number of gates.
