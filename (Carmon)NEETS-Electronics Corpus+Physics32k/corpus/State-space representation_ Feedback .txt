A common method for feedback is to multiply the output by a matrix K and setting this as the input to the system:




u

(
t
)
=
K

y

(
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (t)=K\mathbf {y} (t)}
. Since the values of K are unrestricted the values can easily be negated for negative feedback. The presence of a negative sign (the common notation) is merely a notational one and its absence has no impact on the end results.

{\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {x} }}(t)=A\mathbf {x} (t)+B\mathbf {u} (t)}

u

(

{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)=C\mathbf {x} (t)+D\mathbf {u} (t)}

becomes

y

{\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {x} }}(t)=A\mathbf {x} (t)+BK\mathbf {y} (t)}

x

(
t

+

K

y

(
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)=C\mathbf {x} (t)+DK\mathbf {y} (t)}

solving the output equation for




y

(
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)}
and substituting in the state equation results in

x

{\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {x} }}(t)=\left(A+BK\left(I-DK\right)^{-1}C\right)\mathbf {x} (t)}

x

(

{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)=\left(I-DK\right)^{-1}C\mathbf {x} (t)}

The advantage of this is that the eigenvalues of A can be controlled by setting K appropriately through eigendecomposition of




(

A
+
B
K


(

I

K

)


−

C

)



{\displaystyle \left(A+BK\left(I-DK\right)^{-1}C\right)}
. This assumes that the closed-loop system is controllable or that the unstable eigenvalues of A can be made stable through appropriate choice of K.
