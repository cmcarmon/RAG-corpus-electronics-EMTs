Frequency multipliers are operated by the pulses of collector current produced by a class C amplifier. 
Although the collector current flows in pulses, the alternating collector voltage is sinusoidal because of 
the action of the tank circuit. When the output tank circuit is tuned to the required harmonic, the tank 
circuit acts as a filter, accepting the desired frequency and rejecting all others.
