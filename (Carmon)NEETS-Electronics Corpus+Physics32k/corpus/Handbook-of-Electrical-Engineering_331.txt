The concept of the voltage v between two points was introduced in Section 3.1
as the energy w expended per unit charge in moving the charge between the two
points. Coupled with the deÔ¨Ånition of current i as the time rate of charge motion
and that of power p as the time rate of change of energy, this leads to the following
fundamental relationship between the power delivered to a two-terminal elec-
trical component and the voltage and current of that component, with standard
references (meaning that the voltage reference plus is at the tail of the current
reference arrow) as shown in Fig. 3.19:
