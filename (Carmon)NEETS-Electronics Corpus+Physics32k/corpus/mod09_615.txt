In figure 4-35, a 100-microsecond pulse at an amplitude of 100 volts is applied to the circuit. The 
circuit is composed of the, 0.01ÂµF capacitor and the variable resistor, R. The square wave applied is a 
pure square wave. The resistance of the variable resistor is set at a value of 1,000 ohms. The time constant 
of the circuit is given by the equation:
