MAGNETIC MICROPHONE.â€”The MAGNETIC or MOVING-ARMATURE MICROPHONE 
(figure 1-36) consists of a coil wound on an armature that is mechanically connected to the diaphragm 
with a driver rod. The coil is located between the pole pieces of the permanent magnet. Any vibration of 
the diaphragm vibrates the armature at the same rate. This varies the magnetic flux in the armature and 
through the coil.
