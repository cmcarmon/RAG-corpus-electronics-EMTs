As advances in lithography and fabrication of the N-type metal
oxide superconductor (NMOS) technology became possible in
the 1970s, the bipolar digital logic, transistor-transistor logic
(TTL) lost the battle in the digital design world for exactly the
same reasons that caused older technologies, such as the
vacuum tube technology, to retire. Circuits implemented in
the NMOS technology outperformed the corresponding TTL
circuits in terms of power dissipation. One of the main aspects
of power consumption is that it puts an upper limit on the
number of gates that can be reliably integrated on a single
package for any technology. As technology advanced, chips
grew, and it was possible to integrate more functions into
one chip. Just as for TTL, newer technology, called CMOS,
threatened to replace NMOS in the 1980s because CMOS
proved to consume even less power. With further advances in
technology and fabrication, the integration densities and the
rate at which chips operate have increased drastically, causing
power consumption to be of primary concern. In addition, the
new requirements set by device portability, reliability, and costs
have helped in alleviating the power consumption threat in
CMOS circuits. Because the power problem is getting more
