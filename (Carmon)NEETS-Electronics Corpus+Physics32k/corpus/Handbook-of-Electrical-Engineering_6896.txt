The noise power output PYY (B) of an actual device is a superposition of the ampliÔ¨Åed source thermal noise
G 2PWW (B) and the device noise, i.e., PYY (B) =  G 2 PWW (B) + (device noise). The output noise across RL can be
measured by putting a single frequency (in the passband) source generator S(t) as input. First, S(t) is turned
off, and the output rms voltage Y(t) is measured and the output power PY( W)(B) is recorded. This is the sum
of the thermal available power and the device noise. Next, S(t) is turned on and adjusted until the output power
doubles,  i.e.,  until  the  output  power  PY ( W)(B)  +  PY(S)(B)  =  2PY( W)(B).  This  PSS(B)  is  recorded.  Solving  for
PY(S)(B) = PY( W)(B), we substitute this in F = PY ( W)(B)/(G 2PWW (B)) to obtain
