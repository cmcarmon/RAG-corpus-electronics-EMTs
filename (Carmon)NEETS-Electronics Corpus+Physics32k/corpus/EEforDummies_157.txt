The zigzag symbol in the circuit diagram represents a resistor. The role of 
the resistor is to limit the amount of current that flows through the circuit, 
much like a kink in a garden hose restricts water flow. Chapter 5 gives you 
more information about resistors, but for now, just know that resistance is 
measured in units called ohms (symbolized as Ω) and that the resistor in this 
circuit is keeping the LED from being destroyed.
