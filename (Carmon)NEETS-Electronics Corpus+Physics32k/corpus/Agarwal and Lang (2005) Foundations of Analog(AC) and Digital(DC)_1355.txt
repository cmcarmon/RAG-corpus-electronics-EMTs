(b) During the transient, the difference between v1 and v2 must appear across some
element or elements within the circuit. KVL requires this. For example, it could
appear across the wiring resistance or the switch, or a combination of both. In any
case, energy is lost as a current passes through this voltage difference. If we consider
the voltage difference to be (v1 âˆ’ v2), as opposed to its opposite, then it is i2 that
passes into the positive terminal of this difference. Why?
