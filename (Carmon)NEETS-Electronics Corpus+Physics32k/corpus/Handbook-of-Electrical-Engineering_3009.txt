At  high  signal  frequencies,  the  voltage  gain,  driving  point  input  impedance,  and  driving  point  output
impedance can be approximated by functions whose analytical forms mirror those of Eqs. (28.15), (28.23), and
(28.24). Let TpCB and TzCB designate the time constants of the effective dominant pole and the effective dominant
zero, respectively, of the common base cell. An analysis of the structure of Fig. 28.16(b) resultantly produces,
with Ro and Rc ignored,
