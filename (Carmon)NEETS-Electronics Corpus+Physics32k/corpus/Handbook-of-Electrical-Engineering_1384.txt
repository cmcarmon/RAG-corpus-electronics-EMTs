Let  {Yt,  t  =  0,  .  .  .,  T}  be  a  training  data  from  the  clean  signal,  where Yt  is  a  K-dimensional  vector  in  the
Euclidean space RK. Let {Zt, t = 0, . . ., T} be a training data from the noisy signal, where Zt, ˛ RK. The sequence
{Z t } can be obtained by adding a noise training sequence {Vt, t = 0, . . ., T} to the sequence of clean signals
{Yt}. Let z  ˛  RK be a vector of the noisy signal from which the vector y of the clean signal is estimated. Let
Y(z) = {Yt: Zt = z, t = 0, . . ., T} be the set of all clean vectors from the training data of the clean signal which
could have resulted in the given noisy observation z. The cardinality of this set is denoted by  *Y(z) *. Then, the
sample average estimate of the conditional mean of the clean signal y given the noisy signal z is given by
