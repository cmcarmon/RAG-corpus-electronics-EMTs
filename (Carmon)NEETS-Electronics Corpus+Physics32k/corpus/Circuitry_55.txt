where S is the reluctance of the magnetic path, l is 
the  length  of  the  path  (in  metres),  A is  the  cross-
sectional area of the path (in square metres), and µ
is 
the  magnetic 
material. 
  The absolute permeability of a magnetic material 
is the product of the permeability of free space (µ0)
and  the  relative  permeability  of  the  magnetic 
medium (µ0). Thus 
0=µ µ µ×
