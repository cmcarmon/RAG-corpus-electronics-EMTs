In the section “Feeling the heat,” I discuss the 
temperature sensors called thermistors — but 
there are several other types of temperature 
sensors. Here’s a brief summary of their char­
acteristics:
▶✓ Semiconductor  temperature  sensor:  The 
most common type of temperature sensor, 
whose output voltage depends on the tem­
perature,  contains  two  transistors  (more 
about those in Chapter 10).
