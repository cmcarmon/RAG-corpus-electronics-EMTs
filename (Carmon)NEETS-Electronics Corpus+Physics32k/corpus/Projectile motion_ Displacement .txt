{\displaystyle y=ax+bx^{2}}

in which a and b are constants. This is the equation of a parabola, so the path is parabolic. The axis of the parabola is vertical.
If the projectile's position (x,y) and launch angle (θ or α) are known, the initial velocity can be found solving for v0 in the aforementioned parabolic equation:
