. Coding redundancy: Consider the case of an 8-bit per
pixel image (i.e., each pixel in the image is represented
with an 8-bit value ranging between 0 to 255, depending
on the local luminosity level in that particular area of the
image). Because the gray scale value of some of the pixels
may be small (around zero for a darker pixel), represent-
ing those pixels with the same number of bits for the ones
with a higher pixel value (brighter pixels) is not a good
coding scheme. In addition, some of the gray scale values
in the image may be occurring more often than others. A
more realistic approach would be to assign shorter codes
to the more frequent data. Instead of using Ô¨Åxed-length
codes as above, the variable length coding schemes (e.g.,
Shannon-Fano, Huffman, arithmetic, etc.) would be used
in which the smaller and more frequently occurring gray
scale values get shorter codes. If the gray levels of an
image are encoded in such a way that uses more code
symbols than absolutely necessary to represent each gray
level, the resulting image is said to contain the coding
redundancy.
