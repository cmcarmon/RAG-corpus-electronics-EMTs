The second broad class of phonemes, the consonants, con-
sists of speech sounds that are produced with a constricted
vocal tract. Some consonants require precise dynamic move-
ment of the articulators for their production. Other conso-
nants, however, may not require articulator motion, so their
sounds, like vowels, are sustained (hence, continuants). Con-
sonants are subclassiÔ¨Åed as fricatives, affricates, stops, and
nasals.
