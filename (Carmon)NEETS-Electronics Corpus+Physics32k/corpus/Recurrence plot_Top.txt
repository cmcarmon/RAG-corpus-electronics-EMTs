In descriptive statistics and chaos theory, a recurrence plot (RP) is a plot showing, for a given moment in time, the times at which a phase space trajectory visits roughly the same area in the phase space. In other words, it is a graph of







x
→



(
i
)
≈



x
→



(
j
)
,


{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}(i)\approx {\vec {x}}(j),}

showing



i


{\displaystyle i}
on a horizontal axis and



j


{\displaystyle j}
on a vertical axis, where






x
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}
is a phase space trajectory.
