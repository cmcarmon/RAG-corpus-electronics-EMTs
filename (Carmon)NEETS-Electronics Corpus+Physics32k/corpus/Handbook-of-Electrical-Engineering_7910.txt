An extended form of transparent operation is provided in addressable latches such as the eight-bit 74LS259.
As well as being able to store successive bits arriving at a single input, D, in the eight addressable latches, using
a three-bit address, any latch can be selected for output so that the device can also act as a 1-of-8 decoder or
demultiplexer. Four modes of operation are possible under the control of the  enable and clear inputs. In the
addressable  latch  mode  the  single-addressed  latch  acts  transparently,  with  all  other  latches  retaining  their
previous states. When in the memory mode all latches retain their previous states and are unaffected by address
or data inputs. In the decode mode the output of the addressed latch follows the level at the D input, and in
the clear mode all outputs are set low.
