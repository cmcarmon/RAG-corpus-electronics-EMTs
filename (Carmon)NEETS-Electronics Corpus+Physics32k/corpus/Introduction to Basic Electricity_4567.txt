combine the basic components of AND gates, OR 
gates, and inverters to produce more sophisticated 
circuits. The output of a combinational logic circuit is 
a function of the states of the inputs, the types of gates 
used, and the interconnection of the gates. The most 
common of the combinational circuits are  decoders, 
 encoders, multiplexers, and arithmetic circuits.
