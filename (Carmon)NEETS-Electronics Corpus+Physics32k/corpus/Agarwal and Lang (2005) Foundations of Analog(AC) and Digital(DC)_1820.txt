respectively. From these equations we see that the derivative of the capacitor
voltage is proportional to the capacitor current, and that the derivative of the
inductor current is proportional to the inductor voltage. Therefore, to determine
expressions for the state derivatives, we can equivalently find expressions for the
capacitor currents and inductor voltages. These expressions should be derived
in terms of the states and any independent external signals. This suggests a
method for deriving the state equations.
