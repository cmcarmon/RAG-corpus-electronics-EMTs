Dynamic power component is the power expended while
charging and discharging the capacitive nodes. This physical
capacitance is attributed to the transistor parasitic capacitance
and the interconnect capacitance. Reducing these capacitive
nodes could result in substantial power reductions across the
whole system, as equation 53 shows. So, minimizing capaci-
tances offers another option for minimizing power consump-
tion. Estimating this capacitance at the behavioral or logical
levels of abstraction, however, is difÔ¨Åcult and imprecise if gate
mapping into a cell library is not done (Pedram, 1995).
