where L is assumed to be a constant and not a function of time (which it could be if the physical
shape of the coil changed with time). Mathematically, by looking at Equations (1.2.17) and
(1.2.27), the inductor is the dual of the capacitor. That is to say, the terminal relationship for
one circuit element can be obtained from that of the other by interchanging v and i, and also by
interchanging L and C.
