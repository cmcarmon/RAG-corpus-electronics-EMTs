A force-free magnetic field is a magnetic field that arises when the plasma pressure is so small, relative to the magnetic pressure, that the plasma pressure may be ignored, and so only the magnetic pressure is considered. For a force free field, the electric current density is either zero or parallel to the magnetic field. The name "force-free" comes from being able to neglect the force from the plasma.
