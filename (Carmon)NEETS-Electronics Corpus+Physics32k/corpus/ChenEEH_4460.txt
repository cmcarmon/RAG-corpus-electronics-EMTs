are the Luenberger gain, the steady-state Kalman ﬁlter gain, or
a curve ﬁt to the time-varying Kalman gain sequence. Iteration
of equations 4.27 and 4.28 once for the optimal gain sequence
and once for a suboptimal gain sequence allows analysis of the
amount of performance degradation expected from the sub-
optimal approach. Note that this paragraph has only con-
sidered the case where the design model matches the actual
system, but a suboptimal gain sequence is used. The case where
the ﬁlter model is distinct from the system model is discussed
in the remainder of this section.
