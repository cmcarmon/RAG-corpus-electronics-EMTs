As we’ve already learned, electricity requires a complete path (circuit) to continuously ﬂow.
This is why the shock received from static electricity is only a momentary jolt: the ﬂow of
electrons is necessarily brief when static charges are equalized between two objects. Shocks of
self-limited duration like this are rarely hazardous.
