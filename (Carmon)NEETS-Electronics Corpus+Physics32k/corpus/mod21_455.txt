CROSS MODULATION occurs when a signal from an adjacent channel crosses over into a second
channel and modulates the frequency of the second channel. PARASITIC GENERATION occurs when
regenerative feedback is sufficient to cause a circuit to oscillate, even though it is not designed to
oscillate. Both types of distortion are common to systems that are misaligned.
