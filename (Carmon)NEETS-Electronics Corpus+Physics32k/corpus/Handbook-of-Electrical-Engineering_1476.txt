Training HMM-based recognizers involves estimating the parameters for the word or phone models used in
the  system.  As  with  DTW,  several  repetitions  of  each  word  in  the  recognition  vocabulary  are  used  to  train
HMM-based  isolated  word  recognizers.  For  continuous  speech  recognition,  word  or  phone  exemplars  are
typically extracted from word strings or sentences [Lee, 1988]. Parameters for the models are chosen based on
a  maximum  likelihood  criterion;  that  is,  the  parameters  l  maximize  the  likelihood  of  the  training  data  O,
P(O*l).  This  maximization  is  performed  using  the Baum-Welch algorithm  [Rabiner,  1989],  a  re-estimation
