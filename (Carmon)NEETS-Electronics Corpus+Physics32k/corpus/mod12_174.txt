Look carefully at the modulation envelope in view (A). It shows that the negative peak of the 
modulating signal has effectively been limited. If the signal were demodulated (detected in the receiver), 
it would have an appearance somewhat similar to a square wave. This condition, known as 
OVERMODULATION, causes the signal to sound severely distorted (although this will depend on the 
degree of overmodulation).
