In the unoptimized mode, VAX and Sparc compilers are among the many which take the easy approach and
assign variables only to memory locations. In Figs. 87.6 and 87.7, the variable assignments are presented for
the unoptimized and optimized options. Note that only one or two registers are used, both as scratch pads, in
the  unoptimized  option,  whereas  the  optimization  assigns  registers  to  all  variables.  The  expected  execution
time  savings  is  approximately  42  of  the  50  memory  references  per  loop  iteration.  That  does  not  include
additional savings caused by compact code. Detailed comparisons are not presented since the interpretation of
architectural comparisons is highly subjective.
