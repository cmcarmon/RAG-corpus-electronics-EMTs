Although the network is linear, load ﬂow analysis is iterative because of nodal (busbar) constraints. At most
busbars the active and reactive powers being delivered to customers are known but the voltage level is not. As
far as the load ﬂow analysis is concerned, these busbars are referred to as PQ buses. The generators are scheduled
to deliver a speciﬁc active power to the system and usually the voltage magnitude of the generator terminals is
ﬁxed by automatic voltage regulation. These busbars are known as PV buses.
