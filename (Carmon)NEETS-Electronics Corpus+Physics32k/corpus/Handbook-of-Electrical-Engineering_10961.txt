where Ve,1 is a reference voltage at the terminal node, L is the internodal distance, n is the node number, and
E is the electric ﬁeld in the medium. The electric ﬁeld is related to current density by J = Es, where s = 1/r
e
is  the  conductivity  of  the  medium  and J  is  the  current  density.  Since  the  response  of  the  electrical  model  is
independent of Ve,1, we may assume Ve,1 = 0 for convenience in Eq. (113.11).
