In order to generalize Sundman's result for the case n > 3 (or n = 3 and c = 0) one has to face two obstacles:
As it has been shown by Siegel, collisions which involve more than two bodies cannot be regularized analytically, hence Sundman's regularization cannot be generalized.
The structure of singularities is more complicated in this case: other types of singularities may occur (see below).
Lastly, Sundman's result was generalized to the case of n > 3 bodies by Qiudong Wang in the 1990s. Since the structure of singularities is more complicated, Wang had to leave out completely the questions of singularities. The central point of his approach is to transform, in an appropriate manner, the equations to a new system, such that the interval of existence for the solutions of this new system is [0,âˆž).
