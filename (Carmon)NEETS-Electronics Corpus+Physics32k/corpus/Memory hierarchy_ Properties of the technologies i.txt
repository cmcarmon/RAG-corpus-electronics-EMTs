Adding complexity slows down the memory hierarchy.
CMOx memory technology stretches the Flash space in the memory hierarchy
One of the main ways to increase system performance is minimising how far down the memory hierarchy one has to go to manipulate data.
Latency and bandwidth are two metrics associated with caches and. Neither of them is uniform, but is specific to a particular component of the memory hierarchy.
Predicting where in the memory hierarchy the data resides is difficult.
...the location in the memory hierarchy dictates the time required for the prefetch to occur.
