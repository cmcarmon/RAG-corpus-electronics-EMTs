What Is a HLL?
At a rudimentary level, all languages, high and low, must obey a ﬁnite set of rules that specify both their syntax
and  semantics.  Syntax  speciﬁes  legal  combinations  of  symbols  that  make  up  statements  in  the  language.
Semantics speciﬁes  the  meanings  attached  to  a  syntactically  correct  statement  in  the  language.  To  illustrate  the
difference between these two fundamental traits of all languages consider the statement, “The corners of the round
table were sharp.” This is syntactically correct according to the rules of English grammar, but what does it mean?
Round tables do not have sharp corners, so this is a meaningless statement. We say it is semantically incorrect.
