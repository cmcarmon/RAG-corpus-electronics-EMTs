The capacitor, then, can be said to regulate the current flow through the bias resistor. This action is
considered as BYPASSING  or eliminating the effect of the ac input signal in the cathode. For all
practical purposes, you can assume that ac flows through the capacitor to ground. But, remember, ac only
appears to flow across a capacitor. In reality the ac signal is shunted around the capacitor.
