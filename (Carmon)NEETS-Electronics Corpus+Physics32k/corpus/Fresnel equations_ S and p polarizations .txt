The behavior depends on the polarization of the incident ray, which can be separated into 2 cases:
s-polarized (perpendicular) or TE
The incident light is polarized with its electric field perpendicular to the plane containing the incident, reflected, and refracted rays. This plane is called the plane of incidence; it is the plane of the diagram below. The light is said to be s-polarized, from the German, senkrecht, meaning perpendicular.
p-polarized (parallel) or TM
The incident light is polarized with its electric field parallel to the plane of incidence. Such light is described as p-polarized, from parallel.
