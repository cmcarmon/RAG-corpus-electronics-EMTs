The mechanism of avalanche breakdown is different from that of the Zener effect. In the depletion 
region of a PN junction, thermal energy is responsible for the formation of electron-hole pairs. The 
leakage current is caused by the movement of minority electrons, which is accelerated in the electric field 
across the barrier region. As the reverse voltage across the depletion region is increased, the reverse 
voltage eventually reaches a critical value. Once the critical or breakdown voltage has been reached, 
sufficient energy is gained by the thermally released minority electrons to enable the electrons to rupture 
covalent bonds as they collide with lattice atoms. The released electrons are also accelerated by the 
electric field, resulting in the release of further electrons, and so on, in a chain or avalanche effect. This 
process is illustrated in figure 3-3.
