Equation 9.89 shows that the current source supplies the voltage LI◦/T during the
period 0 ≤ t ≤ T as it ramps up the inductor current from 0 A to I◦; note again that
δ(t; T ) = 1/T during that period. In ramping up the inductor current to I◦ the source
delivers the flux linkage LI◦ in accordance with Equation 9.27. This can be verified by
integrating v over 0 ≤ t ≤ T.
Now consider the circuit behavior described by Equations 9.88 and 9.89 in the
limit T → 0. In this case, I becomes the discontinuous current step described by
Equation 9.87 and
