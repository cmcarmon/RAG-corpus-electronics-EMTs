A common fiber optic application is the full duplex link. This link consists of two simple point-to-
point links. The links transmit in opposite directions between the equipments. This application may be
configured using only one fiber. If configured with one fiber, fiber optic splitters are used at each end to
couple the transmit signal onto the fiber and receive signal to the detector.
