The same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity V(t) in each instant.
To obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed "laboratory" system.
As shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point O, the rigid body system origin is at O′ and the vector from O to O′ is R. A particle (i) in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is Ri in the lab frame, and at position ri in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:






R


i


=

R

+


r


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} _{i}=\mathbf {R} +\mathbf {r} _{i}}

The defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector





r


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}}
is unchanging. By Euler's rotation theorem, we may replace the vector





r


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}}
with





R




r


i
o




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}\mathbf {r} _{io}}
where





R




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
is a 3×3 rotation matrix and





r


i
o




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{io}}
is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say t = 0. This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix





R




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
that is changing in time and not the reference vector





r


i
o




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{io}}
, as the rigid body rotates about point O′. Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three versors of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector





r


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}}
would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:






R


i


=

R

+


R




r


i
o




{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} _{i}=\mathbf {R} +{\mathcal {R}}\mathbf {r} _{io}}

Taking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:






V

=

d


R




d

r

o




{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{i}=\mathbf {V} +{\frac {d{\mathcal {R}}}{dt}}\mathbf {r} _{io}}

where Vi is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and V is the velocity of O′ (the origin of the rigid body frame). Since





R




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {R}}}
is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose. So we substitute





I

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {I}}={\mathcal {R}}^{\text{T}}{\mathcal {R}}}

where

{\displaystyle W={\frac {d{\mathcal {R}}}{dt}}{\mathcal {R}}^{\text{T}}}
is the previous angular velocity tensor.
It can be proved that this is a skew symmetric matrix, so we can take its dual to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}=[\omega _{x},\omega _{y},\omega _{z}]}

Substituting ω for W into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{i}=\mathbf {V} +{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} _{i}}

It can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is the "spin" angular velocity of the rigid body as opposed to the angular velocity of the reference point O′ about the origin O.
