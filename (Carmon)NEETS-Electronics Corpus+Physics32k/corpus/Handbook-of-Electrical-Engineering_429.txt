where D13 and D11 are cofactors of the determinant D of the node admittance matrix of the network. Furthermore,
it is noted that the 2-trees corresponding to Dii may be obtained by ﬁnding all the trees of the modiﬁed graph
Gi, which is obtained from the graph G of the network by short-circuiting node i (i being any node other than
