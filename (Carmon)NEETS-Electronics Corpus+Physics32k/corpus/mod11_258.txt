The pin diode consists of two narrow, but highly doped, semiconductor regions separated by a 
thicker, lightly-doped material called the intrinsic region. As suggested in the name, pin, one of the 
heavily doped regions is p-type material and the other is n-type. The same semiconductor material, 
usually silicon, is used for all three areas. Silicon is used most often for its power-handling capability and 
because it provides a highly resistive intrinsic (i) region. The pin diode acts as an ordinary diode at 
frequencies up to about 100 megahertz, but above this frequency the operational characteristics change.
