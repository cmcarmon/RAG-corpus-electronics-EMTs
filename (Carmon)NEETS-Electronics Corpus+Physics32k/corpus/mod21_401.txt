Frequency meters as we know them today are entirely different from their predecessors. Today's 
frequency meters (fig. 3-26) contain waveguide or coaxial lines coupled to quarter-wavelength resonant 
cavities. The meter is adjusted until the cavity is tuned to the resonant frequency of the signal being 
measured. At resonance, power is absorbed by the cavity and produces a dip in the output-power level, as 
measured at the frequency meter's output connector. The resonant frequency is read directly from the 
frequency meter dial and is accurate, in most cases, to approximately Â±0.2%. Frequency meters are 
capable of measuring frequencies in the range of 1 to 40 gigahertz, far exceeding the frequency 
limitations of the average frequency counter.
