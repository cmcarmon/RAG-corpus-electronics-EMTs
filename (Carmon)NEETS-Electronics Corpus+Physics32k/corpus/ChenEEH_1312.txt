AT Attachment Packet Interface (ATAPI)
The enhanced IDE standard functions as an interface for hard
drives and PCs. It would be great, however, if other devices
such as tape drives and CD-ROMs could be controlled through
the same controller. The AT attachment packet
interface
(ATAPI) is an extension to EIDE that enables the interface to
support CD-ROM players and tape drives. Using ATAPI-
capable hardware and software drivers, mixing and matching
different types of drives on the same EIDE controller, are
possible which are both a convenience and savings in hardware
costs.
