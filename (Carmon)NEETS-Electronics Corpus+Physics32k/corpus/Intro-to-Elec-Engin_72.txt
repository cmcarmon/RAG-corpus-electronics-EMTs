Electric circuits or networks are formed by interconnecting various devices, sources, and com-
ponents. Although the effects of each element (such as heating effects, electric-ﬁeld effects,
or magnetic-ﬁeld effects) are distributed throughout space, one often lumps them together as
lumped elements. The passive components are the resistance R representing the heating effect,
the capacitance C representing the electric-ﬁeld effect, and the inductance L representing the
magnetic-ﬁeld effect. Their characteristics will be presented in this section. The capacitor models
the relation between voltage and current due to changes in the accumulation of electric charge, and
the inductor models the relation due to changes in magnetic ﬂux linkages, as will be seen later.
While these phenomena are generally distributed throughout an electric circuit, under certain
conditions they can be considered to be concentrated at certain points and can therefore be
represented by lumped parameters.
