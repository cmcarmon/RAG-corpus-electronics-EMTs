We can make records on magnetic tape any size we need to hold the data. We are restricted only by 
the length of the tape or the capacity of internal storage. For example, a record can be one character, 
several characters, or thousands of characters in length. The collection of records is called a file. A file 
containing payroll records is called a payroll file; a file containing supply inventory records is called a 
supply inventory file.
