One often constructs a simulation to determine the value of a single parameter, such as the system BER. However
the estimate of this parameter has little or no value unless one can ensure that the simulation model closely
resembles the physical system. A number of methods can be used to validate a simulation. Individually, none
of them will guarantee that the simulation results are accurate, but taken as a group, they form a convincing
argument that the results are realistic. Seven methods of validation are mathematical analysis, comparison with
hardware,  bounding  techniques,  degenerate  case  studies,  reasonable  relationship  tests,  subsystem  tests,  and
redundant simulation efforts.
