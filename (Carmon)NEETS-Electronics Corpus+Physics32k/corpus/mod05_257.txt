The ac power on most ships is distributed by a three-phase, three-wire, 450-volt system. The single-
phase transformers step the voltage down to 117 volts. These transformers are connected delta-delta as in
figure 3-10. With a delta-delta configuration, the load may be a three-phase device connected to all
phases; or, it may be a single-phase device connected to only one phase.
