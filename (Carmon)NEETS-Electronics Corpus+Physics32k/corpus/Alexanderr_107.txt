Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts and studied at Yale
and the Royal Academy of Arts in London to become an artist. In the
1830s,  he  became  intrigued  with  developing  a  telegraph.  He  had  a
working  model  by  1836  and  applied  for  a  patent  in  1838.  The  U.S.
Senate  appropriated  funds  for  Morse  to  construct  a  telegraph  line
between  Baltimore  and  Washington,  D.C.  On  May  24,  1844,  he  sent
the famous ﬁrst message: “What hath God wrought!” Morse also devel-
oped  a  code  of  dots  and  dashes  for  letters  and  numbers,  for  sending
messages on the telegraph. The development of the telegraph led to the
invention of the telephone.
