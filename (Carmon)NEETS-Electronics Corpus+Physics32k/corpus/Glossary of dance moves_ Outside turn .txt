Cf. Inside turn.
The term is applied to an individual turn of a partner in the couple. Basically, it denotes the lead/follow connection directed "outside" of the center of the spinning individual. Inside and Outside terminology can not be determined by relativity to partnership as such position alternates every 180 degrees of rotation. Connection points and application of active side are consistent only with regard to the axis of rotation and direction of spin.
See Direction of movement for more detail.
