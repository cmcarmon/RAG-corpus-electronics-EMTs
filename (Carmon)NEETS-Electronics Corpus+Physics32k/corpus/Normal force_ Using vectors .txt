In general, the magnitude of the normal force, N, is the projection of the net surface interaction force, T, in the normal direction, n, and so the normal force vector can be found by scaling the normal direction by the net surface interaction force. The surface interaction force, in turn, is equal to the dot product of the unit normal with the Cauchy stress tensor describing the stress state of the surface. That is:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {N} =\mathbf {n} \,N=\mathbf {n} \,(\mathbf {T} \cdot \mathbf {n} )=\mathbf {n} \,(\mathbf {n} \cdot \mathbf {\tau } \cdot \mathbf {n} ).}

The parallel shear component of the contact force is known as the frictional force (

The static coefficient of friction for an object on an inclined plane can be calculated as follows:
