Gravitational forces from third bodies can cause perturbations to an orbit. For example, the Sun and Moon cause perturbations to Orbits around the Earth. These forces are modeled in the same way that gravity is modeled for the primary body by means of Direct gravitational N-body simulations. Typically, only a spherical point-mass gravity model is used for modeling effects from these third bodies. Some special cases of third-body perturbations have approximate analytic solutions. For example, perturbations for the right ascension of the ascending node and argument of perigee for a circular Earth orbit are:
