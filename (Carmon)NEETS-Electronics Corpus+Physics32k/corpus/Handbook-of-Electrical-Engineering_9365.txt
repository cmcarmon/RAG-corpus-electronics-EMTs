Software for scientiﬁc and engineering applications has changed dramatically in the past several years. In the
1970s and early 1980s, there were few graphics software tools available. Most of the engineering packages were
in the CAD area. Many speciﬁc engineering applications required users to develop and implement programs
to solve their problems. These programs were written in the Fortran or C programming languages using low-
level  graphical  commands  or  calls  to  some  standard  or  quasi-standard  (e.g.,  the  CORE  package)  graphical
routines. Most of these systems were developed for a mainframe computer environment. A trend begun in the
late  1980s  resulted  in  a  change  in  computing  hardware  environments  as  well  as  in  software  approaches.
Predominantly, the hardware platforms are PCs, microcomputers, and powerful Unix workstations, with most
of these machines having excellent graphics capabilities. Software moved from code generation to customized
stand-alone  scientiﬁc  and  engineering  software  tools.  Software  development  uses  standard  languages  and
graphical user interfaces for CH, C, Fortran, and Pascal, as well as more sophisticated languages such as JAVA,
HyperText,  Unix  X.11,  Microsoft’s  Windows,  and  PostScript.  The  technical  community  is  relying  more  and
more on the increased power of computers to easily support software packages that manipulate complex data
and represent them in a visual manner.
