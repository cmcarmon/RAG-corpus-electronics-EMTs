FIGURE 115.6
Stylized version of a normal lead II recording showing the P wave, QRS complex, and the T and U waves.
The  PR  interval  and  the  ST  segment  are  signiﬁcant  time  windows.  The  peak  amplitude  of  the  QRS  is  about  1  mV.  The
vertical scale is usually 1 mV/cm. The time scale is usually based on mm/s scales with 25 mm/s being the standard form.
The small boxes of the ECG are 1 · 1 mm.
