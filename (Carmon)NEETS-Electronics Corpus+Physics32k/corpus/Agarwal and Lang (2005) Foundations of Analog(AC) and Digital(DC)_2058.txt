we can hold the values of L and C constant, and choose resistance values of
2 , 1 , 0.1 , and 0.01 , to obtain Q’s of 0.5, 1, 10, and 100, respectively.
It is easy to see from Figure 14.34 that higher the value of Q, the greater the
‘‘peakiness’’ or selectivity of the curve. Notice also that the phase curves show
a corresponding sharper transition as Q increases.
