network:
(1) Registration server (or registrars): This server keeps
track of the user location (i.e., the current PC or
terminal on which the user resides). The user–agent
sends a registration message to the SIP registrar, and
the registrar stores the registration information in a
location service via a non-SIP protocol (e.g., LDAP).
Once the information is stored, the registrar sends the
appropriate response back to the user–agent.
