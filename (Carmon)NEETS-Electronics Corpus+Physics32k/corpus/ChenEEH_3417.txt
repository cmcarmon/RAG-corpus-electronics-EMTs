relay implementation approaches being possible. This is all
due to a great ﬂexibility of the microprocessor-based technol-
ogy almost exclusively used to build relays today. Since the
microprocessor-based relays use very low-level voltage signal at
inputs to the signal measurement circuitry, all these relays have
auxiliary transformers at the front-end to scale down the
input signal levels even further from what is available at the
secondary of an instrument transformer. To accommodate
speciﬁc needs and provide different levels of the relay input
quantities, some of the relay designs come with multiple con-
nections of the auxiliary transformers called taps. Selecting
appropriate tap determines a speciﬁc turns ratio for the auxil-
iary transformer that allows more precise selection of the
speciﬁc level of the relay input signal. Besides the voltage
and/or current signals as inputs and trip signals as outputs,
the relays have a number of input/output connections aimed at
other functions: coordination with other relays, communica-
tion with relays and operators, and monitoring. For an elec-
tronic relay, a connection to the power supply also exists.
