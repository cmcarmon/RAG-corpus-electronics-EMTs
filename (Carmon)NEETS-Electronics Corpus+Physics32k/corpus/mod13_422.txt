When the data is required for some other operation, a positive-going pulse is applied to the READ
OUT inputs of the AND gates. This HIGH, along with the HIGHs from the FFs, causes the outputs of
AND gates 5, 6, and 8 to go HIGH. Since the Q output of FF3 is LOW, the output of gate 7 will be LOW.
The 4-bit word, 1101, is transferred to where it is needed.
