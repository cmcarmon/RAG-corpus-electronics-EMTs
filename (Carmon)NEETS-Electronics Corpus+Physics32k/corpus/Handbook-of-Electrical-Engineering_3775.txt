The  shadowing  function  S(q)  is  important  at  a  low  grazing  angle.  It  considers  the  effect  of  geometric
shadowing—the fact that the incident wave cannot illuminate parts of the earth’s surface shadowed by higher
parts. In a geometric approach, where diffraction and multiple scattering effects are neglected, the reﬂecting
surface will consist of well-deﬁned zones of illumination and shadow. As there will be no ﬁeld on a shadowed
portion of the surface, the analysis should include only the illuminated portions of the surface. The phenomenon
of shadowing of a stationary surface was ﬁrst investigated by Beckman in 1965 and subsequently reﬁned by
Smith [1967] and others. A pictorial representation of rough surfaces illuminated at angle of incidence q (= 90(cid:176) –
y) is shown in Fig. 37.6. It is evident from the figure that the shadowing function S(q) is equal to unity when
q  = 0 and zero when q  = p  /2. According to Smith [1967],
