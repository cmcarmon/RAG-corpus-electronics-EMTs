The induced-L2 norm is commonly interpreted as the gain
applied to the energy of an input signal; designing a controller
to limit the induced-L2 norm of various system loops ensures
that internal or output signal energy does not exceed pre-
scribed thresholds. This has obvious implications for overall
system performance. The design objective is commonly ap-
