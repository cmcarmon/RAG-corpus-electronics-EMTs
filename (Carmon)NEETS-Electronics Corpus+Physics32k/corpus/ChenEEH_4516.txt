System realization is a technique to determine an internal
state-space description for a system given with an external
description, typically its TFM or impulse response. The name
reﬂects the fact that if a state-space description is available, an
electronic circuit can be built in a straightforward manner to
realize the system response. There is a great amount of litera-
ture on this subject both from a system theoretical point of
view (Antsaklis and Michel, 1997) and from a practical system
identiﬁcation point of view (Juang, 1994). In the following, a
well-developed method in the second category, the eigensys-
