Taking a closer look at a digital multimeter
All digital multimeters perform the basic voltage, resistance, and current 
measurements. Where they differ is in the range of values they can measure, 
the additional measurements they can perform, the resolution and sensitivity 
of their measurements, and the extra bells and whistles they come with.
