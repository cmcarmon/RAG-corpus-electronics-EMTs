It should be recognized that there are many models other than the one introduced here, from the simple
but very common h-parameter version to complex and comprehensive versions developed for computer-aided
design  (CAD)  methods.  However,  the  present  elementary  approach  has  been  from  a  design  rather  than  an
analytical  direction,  for  it  is  obvious  that  powerful  modern  computer-oriented  methods  such  as  the  SPICE
variants become useful only when a basic circuit conÔ¨Åguration has been established, and at the time of writing,
this is still the province of the human designer.
