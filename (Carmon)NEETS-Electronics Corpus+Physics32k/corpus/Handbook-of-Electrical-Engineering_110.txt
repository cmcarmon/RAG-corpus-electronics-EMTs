Inductors
Inductance  is  used  for  the  storage  of  magnetic  energy.  Magnetic  energy  is  stored  as  long  as  current  keeps
ï¬‚owing through the inductor. In a perfect inductor, the current of a sine wave lags the voltage by 90(cid:176).
Impedance
Inductive reactance XL , the impedance of an inductor to an ac signal, is found by the equation
