Each element also has an atomic	weight. The 
atomic weight is the mass of the atom and is deter-
mined by the total number of protons and neutrons 
in the nucleus. Electrons do not contribute to the total 
mass of the atom; an electronâ€™s mass is only 1/1845 that 
of a proton and is not significant enough to consider. 
The electrons orbit in concentric circles about the nu-
cleus. Each orbit is called a shell. These shells are filled 
in sequence; K is filled first, then L, M, N, and so on 
(Figure 10-3). The maximum number of electrons that 
each shell can accommodate is shown in Figure 10-4.
