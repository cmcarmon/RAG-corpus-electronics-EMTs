If only the larynx is involved, an externally applied artiÔ¨Åcial larynx can be used to generate a resonant column
of air that can be modulated by other elements in the vocal tract. If other motor skills are intact, typing can
be used to generate text, which in turn can be spoken via text-to-speech devices described above. And the rate
of typing (either whole words or via coding) might be fast enough so that reasonable speech rates could be
achieved.
