The maximum voltage a diode can withstand when 
reverse biased is called the peak inverse voltage (PIV). 
A diode should be selected that has a PIV higher than 
twice the peak value. Ideally, the diode should be op-
erated at 80% of its rated value to allow for changes 
in the input voltage. This holds true for both the half-
wave and the full-wave rectifier but does not hold true 
for the bridge rectifier.
