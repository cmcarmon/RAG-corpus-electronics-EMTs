Referring to Figure 3.1.1(a), in a purely resistive circuit, notice that the current is in phase
with the voltage. Observe the waveforms of iR and vR in the time domain and their relative
locations in the phasor domain, notice the phasors ¯VR chosen here as a reference, and ¯IR, which
is in phase with ¯VR. The phase angle between voltage and current is zero degrees, and the cosine
