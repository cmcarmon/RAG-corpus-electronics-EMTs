In microminiature form (epoxy or metal packages or as part of a VLSI mask layout) the operational ampliﬁer
(op amp) is usually fabricated in integrated circuit (IC) form. The general environment is shown in Fig. 27.7.
A pair of + and – regulated power supplies (or batteries) may supply all of the op amp in a system, typically
with –10 – –15 V. The ground and power supply buses are usually assumed, and an individual op-amp symbol
is shown in Fig. 27.8. Such ampliﬁers feature:
