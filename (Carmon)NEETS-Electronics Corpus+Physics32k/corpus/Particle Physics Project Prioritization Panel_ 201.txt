In 2013, HEPAP was asked to convene a panel (the P5) to evaluate research priorities in the context of anticipated developments in the field globally in the next 20 years. Recommendations were to be made on the basis of three funding scenarios for high-energy physics:
A constant funding level for the next three years followed by an annual 2% increase, relative to the FY2013 budget
A constant funding level for the next three years followed by an annual 3% increase, relative to the proposed FY2014 budget
An unconstrained budget
In May 2014, the first P5 report since 2008 was released. The 2014 report identified five "science drivers"—goals intended to inform funding priorities—drawn from a year-long discussion within the particle physics community. These science drivers are:
Use of the Higgs boson as a tool for further inquiry
Investigation of the physics of neutrino mass
Investigation of the physics of dark matter
Investigation of the physics of dark energy and cosmic inflation
Exploration of new particles, interactions, and physics principles
