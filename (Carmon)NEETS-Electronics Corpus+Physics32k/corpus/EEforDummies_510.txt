Analog radio receivers use RLC circuits to allow just one frequency to pass 
through the circuit. This process is known as tuning in to the frequency; used 
this way, the circuit is known as a tuning circuit. A variable capacitor is used 
to adjust the resonant frequency, so you can tune in different stations broad-
casting at different frequencies. The knob that allows the capacitance to be 
changed is attached to the tuning‚Äêcontrol knob on your radio.
