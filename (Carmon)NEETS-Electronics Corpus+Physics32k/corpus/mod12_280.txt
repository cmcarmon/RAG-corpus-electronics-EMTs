METHODS OF FREQUENCY MODULATION.â€”The circuit shown earlier in figure 2-6 and the
discussion in previous paragraphs were for illustrative purposes only. In reality, such a circuit would not
be practical. However, the basic principle involved (the change in reactance of an oscillator circuit in
accordance with the modulating voltage) constitutes one of the methods of developing a frequency-
modulated wave.
