The tendency of a particular naturally convective system towards turbulence relies on the Grashof number (Gr).

In very sticky, viscous fluids (large ν), fluid movement is restricted, and natural convection will be non-turbulent.
Following the treatment of the previous subsection, the typical fluid velocity is of the order of

, up to a numerical factor depending on the geometry of the system. Therefore, Grashof number can be thought of as Reynolds number with the velocity of natural convection replacing the velocity in Reynolds number's formula. However In practice, when referring to the Reynolds number, it is understood that one is considering forced convection, and the velocity is taken as the velocity dictated by external constraints (see below).
