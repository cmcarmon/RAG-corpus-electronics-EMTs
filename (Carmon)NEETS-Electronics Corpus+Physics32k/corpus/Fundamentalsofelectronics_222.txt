The notion of impedance arises when we assume the sources are complex exponentials. This assumption
may seem restrictive; what would we do if the source were a unit step? When we use impedances to ﬁnd the
transfer function between the source and the output variable, we can derive from it the diﬀerential equation
that relates input and output. The diﬀerential equation applies no matter what the source may be. As
we have argued, it is far simpler to use impedances to ﬁnd the diﬀerential equation (because we can use
series and parallel combination rules) than any other method. In this sense, we have not lost anything by
temporarily pretending the source is a complex exponential.
