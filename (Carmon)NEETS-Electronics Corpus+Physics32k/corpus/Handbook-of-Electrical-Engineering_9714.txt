where p
Q is the part quality factor, with several categories, ranging from a full mil-spec part to a commercial
part; p
T is the temperature acceleration factor, related to both the technology in use and the actual operating
temperature; p
V is the voltage stress derating factor, which is higher for devices operating at higher voltages;
p
E  is  the  application  environment  factor  (the  handbook  gives  figures  for  many  categories  of  environment,
ranging from laboratory conditions up to the conditions found in the nose cone of a missile in ï¬‚ight); p
L is
the device learning factor, related to how mature the technology is and how long the production of the part
has been going on; C1 is the circuit complexity factor, dependent on the number of transistors on the chip; and
C2 is the package complexity, related to the number of pins and the type of package.
