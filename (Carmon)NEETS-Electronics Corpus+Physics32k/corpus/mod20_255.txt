HENRY (H)The electromagnetic unit of inductance or mutual inductance. The inductance of a circuit is 1 
henry when a current variation of 1 ampere per second induces 1 volt. In electronics, smaller units are 
used, such as the millihenry (mH), which is one-thousandth of a henry (H), and the microhenry (µH) 
which is one-millionth of a henry [2].
