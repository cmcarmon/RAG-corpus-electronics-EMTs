In boating, a following sea refers to a wave direction that matches the heading of the boat. For example, if the waves of the body of water are heading in the same direction as the sailor, then the water is "following" the sailor's boat. The word "sea" in this phrase is used regardless of whether or not the situation involves a seafaring vessel.
