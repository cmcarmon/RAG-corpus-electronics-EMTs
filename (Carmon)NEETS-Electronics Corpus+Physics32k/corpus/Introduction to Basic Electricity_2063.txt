Most circuits consist of both series and  parallel  circuits. 
Circuits of this type are referred to as  series-parallel 
 circuits (Figure 17-5). The solution of most  series-parallel 
circuits is simply a matter of  applying the laws and rules 
discussed earlier. Series formulas are applied to the series 
part of the circuit, and parallel  formulas are applied to the 
parallel parts of the circuit.
