At the first instant of time, a pulse of 100 volts in amplitude with a duration of 100 microseconds is 
applied. Since the capacitor cannot respond quickly to the change in voltage, all of the applied voltage is 
felt across the resistor. Figure 4-41 shows the voltage across the resistor (eR) to be 100 volts and the 
voltage across the capacitor (eC) to be 0 volts. As time progresses, the capacitor charges. As the capacitor 
voltage increases, the resistor voltage decreases. Since the time that the capacitor is permitted to charge is 
100 microseconds (equal to 1TC in this circuit), the capacitor will charge to 63.2 percent of the applied
