In the resistor‐LED circuit (refer to Figure 16-7), current has only one path to 
flow through, so you can interrupt the circuit between any two components. 
One way to interrupt the circuit is to remove the jumper that connects the 
resistor to the LED. Then to measure the current, connect the black multime-
ter lead to the LED and the red multimeter lead to the resistor, as shown in 
Figure 16-9.
