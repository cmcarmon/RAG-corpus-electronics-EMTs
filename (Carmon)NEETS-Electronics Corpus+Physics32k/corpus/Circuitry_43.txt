When  a  current  flows  through  a  conductor  a 
magnetic  field  is  produced  in  the  vicinity  of  the 
conductor.  The  magnetic  field  is  invisible  but  its 
presence  can  be  detected  using  a  compass  needle 
(which  will  deflect  from  its  normal  North(cid:1)South 
position).  If  two  current-carrying  conductors  are
