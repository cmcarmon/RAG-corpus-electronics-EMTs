Magnetic ﬂux and ﬂux linkage are two qualities of a spatially
distributed magnetic ﬁeld that are closely related to inductance.
The ﬂux of the B ﬁeld, cm, through a loop is the integral of the
component of B normal to the loop over the loop cross-
section. Mathematically, the magnetic ﬂux through loop i
produced by current in loop j is deﬁned as (Paul et al., 1998):
