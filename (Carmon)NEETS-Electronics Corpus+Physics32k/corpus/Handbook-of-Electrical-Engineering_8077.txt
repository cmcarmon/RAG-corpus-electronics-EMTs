Digital Signal Processing
Digital signal processing (DSP) may be considered a speciﬁc example belonging to the category of computation.
Specialized microprocessors are ﬁnding widespread application in many areas of digital signal processing such
as  telecommunications,  speech  processing,  medical  imaging,  and  radar  [Aliphas  and  Feldman,  1987].  These
microprocessors are designed for very high data rates and contain specialized circuitry to accelerate computa-
tions that are speciﬁc to signal processing. Figure 82.9 illustrates the architectural differences between digital
signal processors and conventional microprocessors.
