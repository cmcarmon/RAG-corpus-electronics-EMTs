denominator polynomial are known as poles, while the roots of the numerator polynomial 
are known as zeros. 
 
The frequency response of the circuit is obtained by substituting jÏ‰ for s in the 
 
transfer function. The time-domain response is found by implementing steps 4 and 5 of 
the general procedure: take the Laplace transform of the input signal and then take the 
inverse Laplace transform of the output signal. In practice, step 4 can be simplified since 
the time-domain behavior of a circuit is almost always evaluated in response to a step or 
ramp voltage input, for which the inverse Laplace transforms can be easily computed or 
obtained  from  existing  tables.  Step  5  is  also  usually  simplified  since  most  transfer 
functions  can  be  approximated  by  one  of  a  few  transfer  functions  which  have  known 
time-domain responses to step and ramp input signals.
