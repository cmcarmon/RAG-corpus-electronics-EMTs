6 SINGLE SWEEP This push button, plus a ready indicator (No. 7), provides the single sweep
operation. When this operation is selected, one sweep is initiated after the sweep
circuit has been triggered. Pushing this button does not cancel the other trigger
modes. When single sweep is first selected, the present sweep is aborted, but the
sweep circuit is not yet armed. An additional push is required to initially arm the
sweep. The button must be pushed again to rearm the sweep circuit each time the
sweep has run. To cancel single sweep, you must select one of the four trigger
mode selections.
