Historical Background
DAB development work began in Europe in 1986, with the initial goal to provide high-quality audio services
to  consumers  directly  by  satellite.  Companion  terrestrial  systems  were  developed  to  evaluate  the  technology
being considered, as well as to provide ﬁll-in service in small areas where the satellite signals were shadowed.
A consortium of European technical organizations known as Eureka-147/DAB demonstrated the ﬁrst working
terrestrial  DAB  system  in  Geneva  in  September  1988.  Subsequent  terrestrial  demonstrations  of  the  system
followed in Canada in the summer of 1990, and in the United States in April and September of 1991.
