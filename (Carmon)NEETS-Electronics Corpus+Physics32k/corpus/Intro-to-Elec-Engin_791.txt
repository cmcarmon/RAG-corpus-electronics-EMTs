While the circuit of Figure 9.3.1(a) functions correctly as an inverter, in order to maintain
low current consumption, large values of RD are needed, but they are undesirable in ICs because
they occupy too much space. In order to increase the number of circuits per IC, RD is usually
replaced by a second MOS transistor, which is known as an active load. When RD is replaced
by an n-channel MOSFET, it results in the logic family known as NMOS, which is widely used
in VLSI circuits such as memories and microprocessors. NMOS logic circuits are more compact
and, as such, more of them can be put on each chip. Also, MOS fabrication is simpler than
bipolar fabrication; with fewer defects, production costs are less. As mentioned before, the main
disadvantage of MOS technology, as compared to TTL, is low output current capacity.
