The TRAVERSE (BEARING) SIGNAL is made up of signals from horn A added to C and from
horn B added to D. By waveguide design, the sum of B and D is made 180 degrees out of phase with the
sum of A and C. These two are combined and the traverse signal is the difference of (A + C) -  (B + D).
Since the horns are positioned as shown in figure 1-19, the relative amplitudes of the horn signals give an
indication of the magnitude of the traverse error. The elevation signal consists of the signals from horns
C and D added 180 degrees out of phase with horns A and B  [(A + B) -  (C + D)]. The sum, or range,
signal is composed of signals from all four feedhorns added together in phase. It provides a reference
from which target direction from the center of the beam axis is measured. The range signal is also used as
a phase reference for the traverse and elevation-error signals.
