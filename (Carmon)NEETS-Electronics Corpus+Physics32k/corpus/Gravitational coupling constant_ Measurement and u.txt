There is no known way of measuring αG directly, and CODATA does not report an estimate of its value. The above estimate is calculated from the CODATA values of me and mP.
While me and ħ are known to one part in 20000000, mP is only known to one part in 20000 (mainly because G is known to only one part in 10000). Hence αG is known to only four significant digits. By contrast, the fine structure constant α can be measured via the anomalous magnetic dipole moment of electron with a precision of a few parts per 1010. Also, the meter and second are now defined in a way such that c has an exact value by definition. Hence the precision of αG depends only on that of G, ħ, and me.
