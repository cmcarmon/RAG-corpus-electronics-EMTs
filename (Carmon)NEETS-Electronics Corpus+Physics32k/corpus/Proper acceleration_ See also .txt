Acceleration: change in velocity
Proper velocity: momentum per mass in special relativity; composed of the spacelike components of the 4-velocity
Proper reference frame (flat spacetime): accelerated reference frame in special relativity (Minkowski space)
Fictitious force: one name for mass times geometric acceleration
Four-vector: making the connection between space and time explicit
Kinematics: for studying ways that position changes with time
Uniform acceleration: holding coordinate acceleration fixed
