ICs used in mass‐produced products are generally more complex and 
require a higher number of pins than DIPs can provide, so manufactur-
ers have developed (and continue to develop) clever ways of packaging 
ICs and connecting them to printed circuit boards. To save space on the 
board (known as real estate), most ICs today are mounted directly to metal 
 connections built onto the PCBs. This is known as surface‐mount technology 
(SMT), and many IC packages are specially designed to be used this way. 
One such surface‐mount IC package is the small‐outline integrated circuit 
(SOIC), which looks like a shorter, narrower DIP with bent leads (called gull 
wing leads).
