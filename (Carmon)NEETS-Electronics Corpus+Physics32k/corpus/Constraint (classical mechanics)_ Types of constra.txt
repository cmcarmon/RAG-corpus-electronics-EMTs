First class constraints and second class constraints
Primary constraints, secondary constraints, tertiary constraints, quaternary constraints.
Holonomic constraints, also called integrable constraints, (depending on time and the coordinates but not on the momenta) and Nonholonomic system
Pfaffian constraints
Scleronomous constraints (not depending on time) and rheonomous constraints (depending on time).
Ideal constraints: those for which the work done by the constraint forces under a virtual displacement vanishes.
