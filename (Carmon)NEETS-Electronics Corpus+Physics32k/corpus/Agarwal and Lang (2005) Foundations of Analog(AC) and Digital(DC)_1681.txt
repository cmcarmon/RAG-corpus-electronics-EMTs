where Ëœt is a dummy variable of integration. Equation 12.1 follows from the
fact that v and vC represent the same voltage, and Equation 12.2 follows
from the constitutive law for the inductor given in Equation 9.30. Thus, once
the node voltage v is determined, both vC and iL are easily determined from
Equations 12.1 and 12.2, respectively.
