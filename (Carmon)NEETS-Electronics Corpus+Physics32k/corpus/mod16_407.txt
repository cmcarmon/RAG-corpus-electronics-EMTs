In testing for grounds, you may use a megger or an ohmmeter. Measuring the resistance to ground
from points in a circuit determines if the point is grounded. Referring again to figure 3-20, you can see
one possible means of testing a cable for grounds. If the jumper is removed from pin D of plug 1 (female),
a test for ground can be made for each conductor in the cable. You can do this by connecting one meter
lead to ground and the other to each of the pins of either of the plugs. A low resistance indicates that some
part of that conductor or one of the plug assemblies is grounded. Both plugs must be removed from their
units; if only one plug is removed, a false indication is possible because a conductor may be grounded
through the unit.
