The previous two sections showed that logic expressions can be represented as
truth tables or gate-level circuits. In this section, we will show the equivalence
of the representations by discussing how we can derive automatically a logic
expression from a truth table. Before we do so, it is useful to introduce a standard
or canonic form of writing logic expressions called the sum-of-products form.
