board.
During the soldering process, a flux residue forms 
on the printed circuit board. The residue is noncorro-
sive in most cases. However, it should be removed, as 
it is sticky and foreign particles can attach to it. Also, 
removing the flux makes the inspection of the board 
easier and gives a more professional appearance to the 
board. There are several defluxers on the market 
that make removing easy. Unfortunately, they are not 
environmentally friendly because they contain trichlo-
rotrifluoroethane as their main ingredient.
