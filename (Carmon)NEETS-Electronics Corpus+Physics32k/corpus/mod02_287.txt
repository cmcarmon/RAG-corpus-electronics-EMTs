In many series circuits you will find resistance combined with both inductive reactance and 
capacitive reactance. Since you know that the value of the reactance, X, is equal to the difference between 
the values of the inductive reactance, XL, and the capacitive reactance, XC, the equation for the impedance 
in a series circuit containing R, XL, and XC then becomes:
