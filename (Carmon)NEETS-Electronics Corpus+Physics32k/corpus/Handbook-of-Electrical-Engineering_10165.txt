Flexible Manipulators
The discussion so far assumed that the links of the robot are rigid. These are designed intentionally to minimize
the vibrations. Most of the present-day industrial robots fall into this category. These robots, however, cannot
handle objects heavier than about 5% their weight. In contrast, lightweight ï¬‚exible arms consume less energy,
achieve faster speeds, and can potentially perform precision assembly tasks. However, it is not possible to move
these  arms  quickly  without  the  onset  of  structural  vibrations  due  to  inadequate  structural  damping.  Efforts
have been underway to increase the damping without substantial increase in weight by using composite materials
or actively controlling the vibrations, or both.
