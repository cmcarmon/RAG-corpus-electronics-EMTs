Vortex's innovation comes from its unusual shape, where a fiberglass and carbon fiber mast oscillates in the wind taking advantage of the vortex shedding effect. At the bottom of the mast a carbon fiber rod moves inside a linear alternator that generates the electricity, with no moving parts in contact. Vortex has a small carbon footprint, is noiseless, has low center of gravity and allows for small foundation dimensions, so more generators can be placed in an area, at twice the density of traditional turbines.
Vortex Bladeless is working three different products. The main characteristics of the three products are:
Vortex Atlantis: 3 meters height and 100W generation capacity, working along with solar panels, mainly to bring energy to an off grid locations.
Vortex Mini: 13 meters height and 4 kW generation capacity, mainly for small-scale/residential wind.
Vortex Grand: 150 meters height and 1MW generation capacity, capable of generating electricity for 400 houses.
Atlantis and Mini models are planned to be introduced for private homes in developing countries, or small constructions like radio antennas with their first field tests in Avila, Spain. And by 2018, with help of crowd funding, the deployment of the Vortex Grand.
