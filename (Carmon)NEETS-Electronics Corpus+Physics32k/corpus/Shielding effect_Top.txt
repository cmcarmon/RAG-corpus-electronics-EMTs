The shielding effect describes the attraction between an electron and the nucleus in any atom with more than one electron. The shielding effect can be defined as a reduction in the effective nuclear charge on the electron cloud, due to a difference in the attraction forces of the electrons in the nucleus. It is also referred to as the screening effect (or) atomic shielding.
