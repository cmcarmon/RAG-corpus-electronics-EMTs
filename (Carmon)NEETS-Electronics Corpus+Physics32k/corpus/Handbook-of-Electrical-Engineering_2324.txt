When performing circuit analysis, two important factors that must be taken into account are the speed and
accuracy of computation. Sometimes, the computation speed can be considerably improved by simplifying the
equivalent circuit model, without signiÔ¨Åcant loss in computation accuracy. For this reason, there are a number
of  equivalent  circuit  models,  depending  on  the  device  application  and  related  conditions.  Equivalent  circuit
models have been developed for diodes, BJTs, and FETs. In this overview, the equivalent circuit models for BJT
and FET devices are presented.
