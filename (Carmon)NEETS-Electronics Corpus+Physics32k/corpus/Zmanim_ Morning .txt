There is also a difference of opinion as to when one may begin to do activities than must be done during the day:
Daybreak, when some light is visible, or
Sunrise, when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon.
The Talmud in Pesachim (see above) holds symmetrically that the time between daybreak and sunrise is also the time in which one can walk four mils. For morning calculations, daybreak is normally held to be when the sun is 16.1Â° below the horizon, or a fixed 72 minutes or 90 minutes before sunrise.
A little after daybreak is a time known as misheyakir, "when one can recognize [another person four cubits away]." This calculation is used as the earliest time to wear tzitzit, and in parallel, tefillin, because this is when the blue thread of the tzitzit can be distinguished from the white threads. Misheyakir is always calculated relative to season and place, and occurs when the sun is either 10.2-11.5 degrees below the horizon.
