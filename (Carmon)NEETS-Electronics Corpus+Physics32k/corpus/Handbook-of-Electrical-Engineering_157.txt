Open-Delta Connection (Fig. 1.27)
An  open-delta  connection  is  used  to  deliver  three-phase  power  if
one  phase  of  a  three-phase  bank  of  transformers  fails  in  service.
When the failed unit is removed from service, the remaining units
can still supply three-phase power but at a reduced rating. An open-
delta  connection  is  also  used  as  an  economical  means  to  deliver
three-phase power using only two single-phase transformers. If P
