Electric Field.â€”The electric field in the electron-resonance oscillator is a product of ac and dc 
fields. The dc field extends radially from adjacent anode segments to the cathode, as shown in figure 2-
32. The ac fields, extending between adjacent segments, are shown at an instant of maximum magnitude 
of one alternation of the rf oscillations occurring in the cavities.
