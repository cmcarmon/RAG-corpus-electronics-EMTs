There are two basic types of voltage regulators. Basic voltage regulators are classified as either 
SERIES or SHUNT, depending on the location or position of the regulating element(s) in relation to the 
circuit load resistance. Figure 4-31 (view A and view B) illustrates these two basic types of voltage 
regulators. In actual practice the circuitry of regulating devices may be quite complex. Broken lines have 
been used in the figure to highlight the differences between the series and shunt regulators.
