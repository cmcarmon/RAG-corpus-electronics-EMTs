Torsen differentials can be used in one or more positions on a motor vehicle:
center — used to apportion appropriate torque distribution between front and rear axles on an all-wheel drive vehicle.
rear — used to apportion appropriate torque distribution between left and right sides in rear axles. This may be on either a rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle.
front — used to apportion appropriate torque distribution between left and right sides in front axles. This may be on either a front-wheel drive or four-wheel drive vehicle.
A four-wheel-drive vehicle, for example, may use either one, two, or three Torsen differentials.
