In the following, it is assumed that the system is a two-body system and the orbiting object has a negligible mass compared to the larger (central) object. In real-world orbital mechanics, it is the system's barycenter, not the larger object, which is at the focus. Specific orbital energy = K.E. + P.E. (kinetic energy + potential energy). Since kinetic energy is always non-negative ( greater than or equal to zero, ≥0) and potential energy is always non-positive (less than or equal to zero, ≤0), the sign of this may be positive, zero, or negative and the sign tells us something about the type of orbit:
If the specific orbital energy is positive the orbit is open, following a hyperbola with the larger body the focus of the hyperbola. Objects in open orbits do not return; once past periapsis their distance from the focus increases without bound. See radial hyperbolic trajectory
If the specific orbital energy is zero, (K.E = - P.E.): the orbit is thus a parabola with focus at the other body. See radial parabolic trajectory. Parabolic orbits are also open.
If the energy is negative, K.E. + P.E. < 0: The orbit is closed. The motion is on an ellipse with one focus at the other body. See radial elliptic trajectory, free-fall time. Planets have closed orbits around the Sun.
