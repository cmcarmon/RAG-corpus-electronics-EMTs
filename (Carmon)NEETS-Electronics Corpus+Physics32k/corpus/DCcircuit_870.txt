An interesting phenomenon applied in the Ô¨Åeld of instrumentation is the Seebeck effect, which
is the production of a small voltage across the length of a wire due to a difference in temper-
ature along that wire. This effect is most easily observed and applied with a junction of two
dissimilar metals in contact, each metal producing a different Seebeck voltage along its length,
which translates to a voltage between the two (unjoined) wire ends. Most any pair of dissimilar
metals will produce a measurable voltage when their junction is heated, some combinations of
metals producing more voltage per degree of temperature than others:
