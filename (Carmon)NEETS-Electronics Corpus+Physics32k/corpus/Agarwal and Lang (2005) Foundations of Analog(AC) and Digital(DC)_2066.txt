The four types of filters constructed using a resonant RLC circuit are sum-
marized in Figure 14.40. The general behavior of each of the filters can be
deduced quickly by observing the behavior of each circuit element within the
filter for low, moderate, and high frequencies. For example, because a capacitor
behaves like an open circuit for low frequencies, and a short circuit for high
