A PIN photodiode is a semiconductor positive-negative (p-n) structure with an intrinsic region
sandwiched between the other two regions (see figure 7-2). It is normally operated by applying a
reverse-bias voltage. The magnitude of the reverse-bias voltage depends on the photodiode application,
but typically is less than a few volts. When no light is incident on the photodiode, a current is still
produced. This current is called the dark current. The dark current is the leakage current that flows when
a reverse bias is applied and no light is incident on the photodiode. Dark current is dependent on
temperature. While dark current may initially be low, it will increase as the device temperature increases.
