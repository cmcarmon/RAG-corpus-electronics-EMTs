Operations on binary numbers can be performed in a manner analogous to
operations on decimal numbers. To illustrate the correspondence, Figure 5.27a
shows the addition of a pair of decimal numbers 26 and 87, and Figure 5.27b
depicts the addition of a pair of positive binary numbers 11 and 11. In both
the decimal and binary case, observe that the addition of the digits in a column
generates a sum digit and a carry digit into the next higher digit column.8
Observe further that adding a pair of two-digit numbers can sometimes result
in a three-digit sum.
