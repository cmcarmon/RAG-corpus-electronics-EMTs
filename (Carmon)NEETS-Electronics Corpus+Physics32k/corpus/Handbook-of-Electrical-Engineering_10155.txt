which represents a set of decoupled equations where the error E = qd – q. If we select the values of Kv and Kp
such that the characteristic roots of Eq. (101.33) have negative real parts, then E approaches zero asymptotically.
Effectiveness of this algorithm depends heavily on two factors: (1) the accuracy of the model and (2) the ability
to compute the coefﬁcient matrices of the equations of motion in real time.
