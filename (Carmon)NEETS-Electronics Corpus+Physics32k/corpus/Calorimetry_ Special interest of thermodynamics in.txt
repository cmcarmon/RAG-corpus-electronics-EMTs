Calorimetry has a special benefit for thermodynamics. It tells about the heat absorbed or emitted in the isothermal segment of a Carnot cycle.
A Carnot cycle is a special kind of cyclic process affecting a body composed of material suitable for use in a heat engine. Such a material is of the kind considered in calorimetry, as noted above, that exerts a pressure that is very rapidly determined just by temperature and volume. Such a body is said to change reversibly. A Carnot cycle consists of four successive stages or segments:
(1) a change in volume from a volume




V

a





{\displaystyle V_{a}\ }
to a volume




V

b





{\displaystyle V_{b}\ }
at constant temperature




T

+





{\displaystyle T^{+}\ }
so as to incur a flow of heat into the body (known as an isothermal change)
(2) a change in volume from




V

b





{\displaystyle V_{b}\ }
to a volume




V

c





{\displaystyle V_{c}\ }
at a variable temperature just such as to incur no flow of heat (known as an adiabatic change)
(3) another isothermal change in volume from




V

c





{\displaystyle V_{c}\ }
to a volume




V

d





{\displaystyle V_{d}\ }
at constant temperature




T

−





{\displaystyle T^{-}\ }
such as to incur a flow or heat out of the body and just such as to precisely prepare for the following change
(4) another adiabatic change of volume from




V

d





{\displaystyle V_{d}\ }
back to




V

a





{\displaystyle V_{a}\ }
just such as to return the body to its starting temperature




T

+





{\displaystyle T^{+}\ }
.
In isothermal segment (1), the heat that flows into the body is given by

{\displaystyle \Delta Q(V_{a},V_{b};T^{+})\,=\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int _{V_{a}}^{V_{b}}C_{T}^{(V)}(V,T^{+})\,dV\ }

and in isothermal segment (3) the heat that flows out of the body is given by

{\displaystyle -\Delta Q(V_{c},V_{d};T^{-})\,=\,-\int _{V_{c}}^{V_{d}}C_{T}^{(V)}(V,T^{-})\,dV\ }
.
Because the segments (2) and (4) are adiabats, no heat flows into or out of the body during them, and consequently the net heat supplied to the body during the cycle is given by

{\displaystyle \Delta Q(V_{a},V_{b};T^{+};V_{c},V_{d};T^{-})\,=\,\Delta Q(V_{a},V_{b};T^{+})\,+\,\Delta Q(V_{c},V_{d};T^{-})\,=\,\int _{V_{a}}^{V_{b}}C_{T}^{(V)}(V,T^{+})\,dV\,+\,\int _{V_{c}}^{V_{d}}C_{T}^{(V)}(V,T^{-})\,dV\ }
.
This quantity is used by thermodynamics and is related in a special way to the net work done by the body during the Carnot cycle. The net change of the body's internal energy during the Carnot cycle,

{\displaystyle \Delta U(V_{a},V_{b};T^{+};V_{c},V_{d};T^{-})\ }
, is equal to zero, because the material of the working body has the special properties noted above.
