switching capacitance of the system, thus reducing the switch-
ing component of the power dissipation. Optimization tech-
niques based on this principle belong to the broad class of
dynamic power management methods. Clock gating provides a
way to selectively stop the clock and thus force the original
circuit to make no transition whenever the computation to be
carried out by a hardware unit at the next clock cycle is useless.
