An alternative expression for the escape velocity




v

e




{\displaystyle v_{e}}
particularly useful at the surface on the body is:





v

e


=


2
g
r





{\displaystyle v_{e}={\sqrt {2gr\,}}}

where r is the distance between the center of the body and the point at which escape velocity is being calculated and g is the gravitational acceleration at that distance (i.e., the surface gravity).
For a body with a spherically-symmetric distribution of mass, the escape velocity




v

e




{\displaystyle v_{e}}
from the surface is proportional to the radius assuming constant density, and proportional to the square root of the average density ρ.
