As shown in figure 6-8, position X of the beam is in the center. It can be moved to position Y by
going up 2 units and then right 2 units. Movement of the beam is the result of the simultaneous action of
both sets of deflection plates. The electrostatic field between the vertical plates moves the electrons up an
amount proportional to 2 units on the screen. As the beam passes between the horizontal plates, it moves
to the right an amount proportional to 2 units on the screen.
