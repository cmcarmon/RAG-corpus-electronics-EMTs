Examination of Equations 13.16 and 13.47 (or Equations 13.21 and 13.50
for the corresponding time functions) shows that the RC circuit of Figure 13.3
and the RL circuit of Figure 13.11 will have frequency response plots of the same
form: unit magnitude and zero phase at low frequencies, and magnitude falling
as 1/ω (slope of −1 in log-log plot) with −90
phase shift at high frequencies.
These functions are called low-pass filters, because in signal-processing terms
they pass low frequencies and reject high frequencies. In other words, they do
not affect low frequencies, while they provide a low gain for high frequencies.
However, in many circuit applications the opposite effect is desired. We wish
to get rid of low frequencies, and pass high frequencies. Decoupling amplifier
stages so that the DC offset from one stage does not affect the next stage is a
case in point. We will study these and other filters in more detail in Section 13.5.
To summarize, the frequency response of circuits containing a single stor-
age element and a single (Thévenin ) resistor is of the form 1/(s + a), (s + a),
s/(s + a), (s + a)/s, where a is some constant, and can be sketched intuitively as
follows:
