The DUTY CYCLE is the ratio of working time to total time for intermittently operated devices.
Thus, duty cycle represents a ratio of actual transmitting time to transmitting time plus rest time. To
establish the duty cycle, divide the pw by the prt of the system. This yields the duty cycle and is
expressed as a decimal figure. With this information, we can figure percentage of transmitting time by
multiplying the duty cycle by 100.
