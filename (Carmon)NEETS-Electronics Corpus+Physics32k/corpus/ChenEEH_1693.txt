Porter et al. (2000) proposed a frequency domain corre-
lation approach. This approach relies on motion estimation
information obtained by use of template matching; that is, for
each 32  32 block in a given frame, the best matching block in
a corresponding neighborhood in the next frame is sought by
calculating the normalized crosscorrelation in the frequency
domain as:
