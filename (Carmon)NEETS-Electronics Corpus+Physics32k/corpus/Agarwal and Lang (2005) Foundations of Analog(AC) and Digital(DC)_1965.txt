In terms of the frequency domain, the square-wave drive can be considered
as a sum of the sine waves:11 A sine wave with the same period as the square
wave, a sine wave at three times this frequency and one-third the amplitude,
another at five times the frequency and one-fifth the amplitude, etc. The higher
frequency sine waves are called harmonics. It is relatively easy to visualize how
each of these components will be altered as they pass through the attenuator
by examining the appropriate frequency response plot. Again looking at the
over-compensated case (C1 is large), the magnitude plot of Figure 13.47 shows
