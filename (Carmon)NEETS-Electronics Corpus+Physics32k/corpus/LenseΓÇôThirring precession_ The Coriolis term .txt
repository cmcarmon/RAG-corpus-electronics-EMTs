The frame-dragging effect can be demonstrated in several ways. One way is to solve for geodesics; these will then exhibit a Coriolis force-like term, except that, in this case (unlike the standard Coriolis force), the force is not fictional, but is due to frame dragging induced by the rotating body. So, for example, an (instantaneously) radially-infalling geodesic at the equator will satisfy the equation

{\displaystyle J=\Vert S\Vert }
is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the spinning massive body.
The above can be compared to the standard equation for motion subject to the Coriolis force
