The basic LED types used for fiber optic communication systems are the surface-emitting LED
(SLED), the edge-emitting LED (ELED), and the superluminescent diode (SLD). LED performance
differences help link designers decide which device is appropriate for the intended application. For
short-distance (0 to 3 km), low-data-rate fiber optic systems, SLEDs and ELEDs are the preferred optical
source. Typically, SLEDs operate efficiently for bit rates up to 250 megabits per second (Mb/s). Because
SLEDs emit light over a wide area (wide far-field angle), they are almost exclusively used in multimode
systems.
