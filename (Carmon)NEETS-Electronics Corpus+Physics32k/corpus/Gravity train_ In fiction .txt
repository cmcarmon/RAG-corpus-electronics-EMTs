The 1914 book Tik-Tok of Oz has a tube, that passed from Oz, through the center of the earth, emerging in the country of the Great Jinjin, Tittiti-Hoochoo. In the 2012 movie Total Recall, a gravity train is used to commute between Western Europe and Australia. In the game Super Mario Galaxy, there are a few holes that Mario can jump through to illustrate the gravity train effect.
