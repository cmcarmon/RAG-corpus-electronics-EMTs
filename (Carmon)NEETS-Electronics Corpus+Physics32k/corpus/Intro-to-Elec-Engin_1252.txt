13.2.27 A 1/4-hp, 110-V, 60-Hz, four-pole, capacitor-
start, single-phase induction motor has the fol-
lowing parameters and losses: R1 = 2 , Xl1 =
= 4 , Xm = 70 .
2.8 , X
The core loss at 110 V is 25 W, and friction and
windage is 12 W. For a slip of 0.05, compute
the output current, power factor, power output,
speed, torque, and efÔ¨Åciency when the motor is
running at rated voltage and rated frequency with
its starting winding open.
