A transistor must be properly biased by external 
voltages so that the emitter, base, and collector regions 
interact in the desired manner. In a properly biased 
transistor, the emitter junction is forward biased and 
the collector junction is reverse biased. A properly 
 biased NPN transistor is shown in Figure 31-5.
