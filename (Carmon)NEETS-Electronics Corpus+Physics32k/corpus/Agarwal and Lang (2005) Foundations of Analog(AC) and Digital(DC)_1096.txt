b) Now consider Figure 7.80b. The current I can be increased either by increasing VS or
decreasing RC. Assuming that either VS or RC may be changed, and that W1/L1 =
W2/L2 = W/L, determine the range of values of I for which both MOSFETs operate
under the saturation discipline. Assume both MOSFETs have the same values for
Kn and VT.
