We can now use the AC equivalent circuit to calculate the AC voltage gain between the base
and collector. The base voltage is developed across the input resistor hie and vB = hieiB.
The collector voltage can be similarity expressed as the voltage drop across the resistor RC:
0 − vC = RChf eiB. Eliminating iB, we can write the ampliﬁer voltage transfer function
