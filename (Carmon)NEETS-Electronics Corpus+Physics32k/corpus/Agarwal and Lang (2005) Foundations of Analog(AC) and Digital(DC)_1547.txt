The circuit depicted in Figure 10.95 implements the logic func-
tion Z = (ABC + D)E. Suppose the output of this circuit drives an inverter with
a gate capacitance of CGS. Assume that the MOSFETs in the circuit have on resis-
tance RON, and that the high and low voltage thresholds are VIH = VOH = VH and
VIL = VOL = VL, respectively.
