The discretized pressure correction equation is same as in the SIMPLE algorithm, except for the d terms which are used in momentum equations.
p=p*+p' which tells that the under relaxing factor is not there in SIMPLEC as it was in SIMPLE.
SIMPLEC algorithm is seen to converge 1.2-1.3 times faster than the SIMPLE algorithm
It doesn't solve extra equations like SIMPLER algorithm.
The cost per iteration is same as in the case of SIMPLE.
Like SIMPLE, a bad pressure field guess will destroy a good velocity field.
