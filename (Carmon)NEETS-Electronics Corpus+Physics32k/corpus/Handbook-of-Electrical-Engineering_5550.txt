Further Information
An  excellent  source  of  information  on  the  application  of  capacitors  on  power  systems  is  the  Westinghouse
Transmission and Distribution book, published in 1964. A most readable treatment of improving system stability
by  series  capacitors  is  given  by  Kimbarkâ€™s  paper  [1966].  Jancke  et al.  [1975]  give  a  detailed  discussion  of
experience with the 400-kV series-capacitor compensation installations on the Swedish system and aspects of
the protection system. Hauer [1989] presents a discussion of practical stability controllers that manipulate series
and/or shunt reactance.
