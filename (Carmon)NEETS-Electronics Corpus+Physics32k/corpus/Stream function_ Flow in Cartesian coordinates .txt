By observing the flow into an elemental square in an x-y Cartesian coordinate system, we have:




δ
ψ
=
u
δ
y



{\displaystyle \delta \psi =u\delta y\,}





δ
ψ
=
−
v
δ
x



{\displaystyle \delta \psi =-v\delta x\,}

where u is the flow velocity parallel to and in the direction of the x-axis, and v is the flow velocity parallel to and in the direction of the y-axis. Thus, as δn → 0 and by rearranging, we have:




u
=



∂
ψ


∂
y






{\displaystyle u={\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial y}}\,}





v
=
−



∂
ψ


∂
x






{\displaystyle v=-{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}\,}
