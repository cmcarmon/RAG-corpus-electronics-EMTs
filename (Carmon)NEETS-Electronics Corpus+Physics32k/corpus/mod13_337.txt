The cross-coupled OR gates in figure 3-14, view B, perform the same functions as the NAND gate
configuration of view A. A HIGH input at SB0 produces a HIGH Q output, and a LOW at RB0 produces
a LOW Q  output. The cross-coupled signals ( Q  to gate 1 and Q to gate 2) are used as the latch signals
just as in view A. You can trace other changes of the inputs using your knowledge of basic logic gates.
