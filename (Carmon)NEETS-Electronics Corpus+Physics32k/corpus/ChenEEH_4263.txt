The problem of a cellular system boils down to the choice of the
way to share a common pool of radio channels between users.
Users can gain access to any channel (each user is not always
assigned to the same channel). A channel can be thought of as
merely a portion of the limited radio resource that is temporar-
ily allocated for a speciﬁc purpose, such as someone’s phone
call. A multiple access method is a deﬁnition of how the radio
spectrum is divided into channels and how channels are allo-
cated to the many users of the systems. The sharing of spectrum
is required to achieve high capacity by simultaneously allocating
the available bandwidth to multiple users. There are three
possible multiple access methods: frequency-division multiple
access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), and
code-division multiple access (CDMA).
