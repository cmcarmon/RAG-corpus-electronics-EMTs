The ASIC designer’s task is to translate the desired VLSI logic function into a physical design using the basic
gate cells provided on the noncustomized IC. To avoiding the routing of intercell interconnections around long
rows of logic cells, some of the “cells” along the row are feedthrough cells, allowing routing of interconnections
to other logic cell rows. Included in the designer’s toolset are library functions predeﬁning the construction of
more-complex logic functions (e.g., adders, registers, multipliers, etc.) from the gate cells on the noncustomized
gate array IC.
