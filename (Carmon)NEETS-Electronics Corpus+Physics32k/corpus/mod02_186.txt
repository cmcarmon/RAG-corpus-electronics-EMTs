In figure 3-10 at time t0, the capacitor is fully charged. When S1 is open and S2 closes, the capacitor
discharge cycle starts. At the first instant, circuit voltage attempts to go from source potential (6 volts) to
zero volts, as shown in graph (A). Remember, though, the capacitor during the charge cycle has stored
energy in an electrostatic field.
