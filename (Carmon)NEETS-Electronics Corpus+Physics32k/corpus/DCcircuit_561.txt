Stepping around the loop 3-4-9-8-3, we write the voltage drop ﬁgures as a digital voltmeter
would register them, measuring with the red test lead on the point ahead and black test lead
on the point behind as we progress around the loop. Therefore, the voltage from point 9 to
point 4 is a positive (+) 12 volts because the ”red lead” is on point 9 and the ”black lead” is on
point 4. The voltage from point 3 to point 8 is a positive (+) 20 volts because the ”red lead” is on
point 3 and the ”black lead” is on point 8. The voltage from point 8 to point 9 is zero, of course,
because those two points are electrically common.
