Most real-world engineering problems have measurement equations or dynamical system equations that are
nonlinear  in  the  state  vector.  Therefore,  the  Kalman  ﬁlter  equations  cannot  be  applied  directly;  rather,  the
problem must be approximated using linear equations. This linear approximation is very straightforward, and
it is called the “extended Kalman ﬁlter” (EKF). One of the main reasons for the wide application of the Kalman
ﬁlter is the ease with which a nonlinear system can be approximated by a linear system. The resulting approx-
imation  is  often  very  good,  resulting  in  good  EKF  performance.  Unfortunately,  the  EKF  performance  is
sometimes poor, in which case a plethora of alternative approximations can be attempted.
