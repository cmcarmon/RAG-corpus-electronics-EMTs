where m is generally referred to as the low-ﬁeld mobility. At
high ﬁelds, the velocity saturates due to phonon scattering.
In a short channel device, the electric ﬁeld across the channel
can become sufﬁciently high such that carriers can suffer
from velocity saturation. The effect of velocity saturation on
MOSFET drain current can be severe. In short channel
MOSFETs, it is impossible to overcome this effect. Thus, it is
