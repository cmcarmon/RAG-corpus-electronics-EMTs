In general, the relationship between wavelength



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
, frequency



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
, and the phase velocity




v

p




{\displaystyle v_{p}}
of a sinusoidal wave is:





v

p


=
λ
ν


{\displaystyle v_{\text{p}}=\lambda \nu }

Using the wavenumber (



k
=
2
π

/

λ


{\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }
) and angular frequency (



ω
=
2
π
ν


{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi \nu }
) notation, the previous equation can be rewritten as





v

p


=


ω
k




{\displaystyle v_{\text{p}}={\frac {\omega }{k}}}

On the other hand, the group velocity is equal to the slope of the wavenumber–frequency diagram:





v

g


=



∂
ω


∂
k





{\displaystyle v_{\text{g}}={\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial k}}}

Analyzing such relationships in detail often yields information on the physical properties of the medium, such as density, composition, etc.
