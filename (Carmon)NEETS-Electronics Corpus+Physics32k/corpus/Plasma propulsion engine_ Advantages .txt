Plasma engines have a much higher specific impulse (Isp) value than most other types of rocket technology. The VASIMR engine is capable of reaching an impulse value of over 12000, while hall thrusters can reach about 2000. This is much higher than the chemical bipropellant fuel that is sometimes used that can reach a specific impulse of 450. With high impulse, these rockets are capable of reaching relatively high speeds. Ex-astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz claims his VASIMR engine could send a payload to Mars in as little as 39 days while reaching a max velocity of 34 miles per second. The trend is the same for other plasma rockets.
Certain plasma thrusters, such as the mini-helicon, are hailed for their simple design and ease of use. With cheap fuel (a large number of gases or combinations of gases can be used as fuel), and relatively simple theory of performance, plasma rockets can be used more than once, and be easily built. Plasma rockets also do not have to spend all of their fuel all at once unlike traditional chemical rockets. This allows plasma rockets to change speed in flight, and even change direction midflight as well.
