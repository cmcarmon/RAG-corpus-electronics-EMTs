Portable and pack radio sets must be lightweight, compact, and self-contained. Usually, these sets are 
powered by a battery or a hand generator, have low output power, and are either transceivers or 
transmitter-receivers. A transceiver consists of a transmitter and a receiver that share common circuits and 
are housed in the same case or cabinet. A transmitter-receiver is the combination of two separate pieces of 
equipment that are used together. Navy ships carry a variety of these radio sets for emergency and 
amphibious communications. The numbers and types of equipment vary according to the individual ship.
