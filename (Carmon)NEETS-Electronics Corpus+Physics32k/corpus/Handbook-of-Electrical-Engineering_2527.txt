Now consider the amount by which vce changes with vbe, which is the terminal voltage gain of the stage. In
Fig.  24.26,  the  slope  of  the  transconductance  curve  at  any  point  deﬁnes  by  how  much  IC  changes  with  a
ﬂuctuation in VBE. That is, it gives the ratio ic /vbe at any operating point Q. Equation (24.4) is
