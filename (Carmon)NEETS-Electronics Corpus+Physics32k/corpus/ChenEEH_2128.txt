Active and passive components are essential building
blocks of microwave circuits and systems that have become
increasingly important due to the booming of next-generation
wireless communications. Chapter 7 describes the basic char-
acteristics of a class of microwave passive components, includ-
ing tuning stubs, lumped elements, impedance transformers
and matching network, couplers, power dividers/combiners,
resonators, and Ô¨Ålters. Scattering parameters are usually used to
characterize the frequency-dependent components. Examples
are given mostly for rectangular metallic waveguides and
microstrip circuits. Active microwave components will also
be discussed in this chapter.
