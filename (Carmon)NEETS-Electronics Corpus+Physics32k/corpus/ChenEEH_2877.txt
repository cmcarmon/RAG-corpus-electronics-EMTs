. Frequency-scan array: If the adjacent antenna elements
are connected by a transmission line with length ‘, the
progressive phase shift will be k‘ ¼ 2p‘=l. By changing
the frequency, the progressive phase shift will be varied,
and the main beam of the array can be controlled by
changing the operating frequency. This type of array is
called the frequency-scan array. If the beam is to point in
a direction u0, then the phase difference f should be:
