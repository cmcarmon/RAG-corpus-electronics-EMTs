Once the electron has been elevated to an energy level higher than the lowest possible energy level,
the atom is said to be in an excited state. The electron will not remain in this excited condition for more
than a fraction of a second before it will radiate the excess energy and return to a lower energy orbit. To
illustrate this principle, assume that a normal electron has just received a photon of energy sufficient to
raise it from the first to the third energy level. In a short period of time the electron may jump back to the
first level emitting a new photon identical to the one it received.
