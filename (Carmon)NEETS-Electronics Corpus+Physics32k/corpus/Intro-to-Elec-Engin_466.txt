5.3.4 In order to minimize output voltage offsets in
practical op-amp circuits, one provides a dc path
from each input terminal to ground, makes each
input terminal see the same external resistance
to ground, and uses external balancing circuits,
if necessary, to null any remaining output offset
voltage.
