Of course, care must be taken in sizing the shunt resistor low enough so that it doesn’t
adversely affect the circuit’s normal operation, but this is generally not difﬁcult to do. This
technique might also be useful in computer circuit analysis, where we might want to have the
computer display current through a circuit in terms of a voltage (with SPICE, this would allow
us to avoid the idiosyncrasy of reading negative current values):
