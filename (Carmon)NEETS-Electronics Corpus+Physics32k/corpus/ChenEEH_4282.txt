network synchronous wideband CDMA scheme has been pro-
posed by CDMA2000. The main technical approaches of
WCDMA and CDMA2000 systems are chip rate, downlink
channel structure, and network synchronization. CDMA2000
uses a chip rate of 3.6864 Mc/s for the 5-MHz band allocation
with the direct spread downlink and a 1.2288 Mc/s chip rate
for the multicarrier downlink. WCDMA uses direct spread
with a chip rate of 4.096 Mc/s.
