The main advantage of a field propulsion systems is that no propellant is needed, only an energy source. This means that no propellant has to be stored and transported with the space craft which makes it attractive for long term interplanetary or even interstellar manned missions. With current technology a large amount of fuel meant for the way back has to be brought to the destination which increases the payload of the overall space craft significantly. The increased payload of fuel, thus requires more force to accelerate it, requiring even more fuel which is the primary drawback of current rocket technology. Approximately 83% of a Hydrogen-Oxygen powered rocket, which can achieve orbit, is fuel.
