The density of circuitry continues to increase, while the number of I/O pins remains small. This causes a
serious escalation of complexity, and testing is becoming one of the major costs to industry (estimated up to
30%).  ICs  should  be  tested  before  and  after  packaging,  after  mounting  on  a  board,  and  periodically  during
operation. Different methods may be necessary for each case. Thus by testing we imply the means by which
some qualities or attributes are determined to be fault-free or faulty. The main purpose of testing is the detection
of  malfunctions  (Go/NoGo  test),  and  only  subsequently  one  may  be  interested  in  the  actual  location  of  the
malfunction; this is called
