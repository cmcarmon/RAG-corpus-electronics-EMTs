(a) The motor is operated from an inﬁnite bus supplying rated voltage and rated frequency,
and its ﬁeld excitation is adjusted so that the power factor is unity when the shaft load
is such as to require an input of 750 kW. Compute the maximum torque that the motor
can deliver, given that the shaft load is increased slowly with the ﬁeld excitation held
constant.
