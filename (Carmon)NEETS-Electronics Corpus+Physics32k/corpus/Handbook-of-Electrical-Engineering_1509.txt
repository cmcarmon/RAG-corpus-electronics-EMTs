where O is the observation vector being modeled, cjk is the mixture coefÔ¨Åcient for the  kth mixture in state j
and N is any log-concave or elliptically symmetric density. Typically, we assume that N is Gaussian with mean
vector m
jk and covariance matrix Ujk for the kth mixture component in state j. The mixture weights cjk satisfy
the constraint:
