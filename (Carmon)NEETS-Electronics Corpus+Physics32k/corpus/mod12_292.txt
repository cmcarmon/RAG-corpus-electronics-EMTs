Frequency multipliers or mixers (discussed in chapter 1) are used to increase the oscillator frequency
to the desired output frequency. For high-power applications, linear rf amplifiers are used to increase the
steady-amplitude signal to a higher power output. With the initial modulation occurring at low levels, fm
represents a savings of power when compared to conventional AM. This is because fm noise-reducing
properties provide a better signal-to-noise ratio than is possible with AM.
