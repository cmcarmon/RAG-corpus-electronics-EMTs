Although  the  overall  solution  effort  has  various  cost  components,  perhaps  the  one  most  considered  is  the
computer  time  and  storage  required  to  obtain  the  numerical  results  desired.  With  the  increasing  computer
memories  becoming  available,  where  even  microcomputers  and  workstations  can  directly  address  gigabytes,
the memory costs of modeling are becoming generally less important than the time cost, with which we are
primarily concerned here. For each model class considered, the computer-time dependence on the number of
unknowns  is  presented  in  a  generic  formula  followed  by  the  highest-order  (L/DL)  term  in  that  formula  to
demonstrate how computer time grows with increasing problem size.
