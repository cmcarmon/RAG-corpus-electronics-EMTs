The amount of data or the number of binary digits (0 and 1 bits) that can be written (stored) on a 
linear inch of tape is known as the tape's recording density. Common recording densities for multitrack 
tapes range from 200 to 6,250 bits/bytes per inch (BPI). Also note that sometimes the density of a tape is
