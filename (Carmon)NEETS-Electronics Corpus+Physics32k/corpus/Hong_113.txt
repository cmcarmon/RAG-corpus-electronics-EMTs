Electronic  filters  are  designed  to  attenuate  signals  in  one  part  of  the  frequency 
spectrum while emphasizing signals in another part of the spectrum. There are four basic 
types  of  filter  responses  as  shown  in  Figure  ###:  low-pass,  high-pass,  bandpass,  and 
band-reject. Low-pass filters are designed to pass signals from DC (ω = 0) to ω = ωc, 
where ωc is known as the cutoff frequency. High-pass filters are designed to pass signals 
from ωc to infinite frequency. Bandpass filters are a combination of low-pass and high-
pass  filters  where  the  width  of  the  pass  band  is  known  as  the  bandwidth  of  the  filter. 
Band-reject or notch filters are the inverse of bandpass filters, and are designed to remove 
interference from a certain frequency range.
