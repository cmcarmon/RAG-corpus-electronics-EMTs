In 1998, Zehavi et al. reported evidence in support of a Hubble bubble. The initial suggestion that local redshift velocities differ from those seen elsewhere in the universe was based on observations of Type 1a supernovae, often abbreviated "SNe Ia." Such stars have been used as standard candle distance markers for 20 years, and were key to the first observations of dark energy.
Zehavi et al. studied the peculiar velocites of 44 SNe Ia to test for a local void, and reported that Earth seemed to be inside a relative void of roughly 20% underdensity, surrounded by a dense shell, a "bubble".
