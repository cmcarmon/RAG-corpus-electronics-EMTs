Figure 5.12 shows three examples of clipping circuits using ideal biased diodes and the waveforms that result
when each is driven by a sine-wave input. In each case, note that the output equals the dc source voltage when
the input reaches the value necessary to forward bias the diode. Note also that the type of clipping we showed
 bias the diode, and the type shown in Fig. 5.10
in Fig. 5.9 occurs when the ﬁxed bias voltage tends to 
 bias the diode. When the diode is reverse biased by the input
occurs when the ﬁxed voltage tends to 
signal, it is like an open circuit that disconnects the dc source, and the output follows the input. These circuits
 clippers because the biased diode is in parallel with the output. Although the circuits behave
are called 
the same way whether or not one side of the dc voltage source is connected to the common (low) side of the
input and output, the connections shown in Fig. 5.12(a) and (c) are preferred to that in (b), because the latter
uses a ﬂoating source.
