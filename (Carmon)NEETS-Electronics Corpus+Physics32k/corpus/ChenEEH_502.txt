The most important semiconductor is silicon. Silicon belongs
to the fourth column of the Periodic Table. Elements belong-
ing to the fourth column of the Periodic Table, such as Si, Ga,
As, Ge, and N, have only s and p electrons in their valence
shells (shells with the largest value of the principal quantum
number, n, for a given atom). It takes eight valence electrons to
ﬁll up all the states in these two valence subshells (two s
electrons and six p electrons). In the Periodic Table, the elem-
ents with completely ﬁlled s and p valence subshells correspond
to inert gases. When atoms are combined together in a solid,
they may share or exchange valence electrons, forming chem-
ical bonds. In silicon, germanium, and related compound
semiconductors, these bonds are formed in such a way that
neighboring atoms share their valence electrons having (on
average) completed s in the valence shell. In these semicon-
ductors, each atom forms
four bonds with four other
atoms (four nearest neighbors) and shares two valence elec-
trons with each of them (i. e., an atom shares eight valence
electrons with all four nearest neighbors). Since each atom has
four nearest neighbors,
it is tetrahedrally coordinated as
shown in Figure 6.2.
