where the minus sign is for the inverting integrator in Figure
4.14(A), and the plus sign for the noninverting integrator in
Figure 4.14(B). We used a scaling resistor Ra
to deﬁne
t ¼ CARa, q ¼ Ra=Rq, the gain constants a1 ¼ Ra=R1, and
a2 ¼ Ra=R2 that multiply the two input voltages V11 and V12.
These gain constants can be adjusted to maximize the
dynamic range of the active ﬁlter, but the treatment goes
beyond the scope of this chapter. We will for simplicity set
a1 ¼ a2 ¼ 1 by selecting Ra ¼ R1 ¼ R2 ¼ R to get t ¼ CAR
