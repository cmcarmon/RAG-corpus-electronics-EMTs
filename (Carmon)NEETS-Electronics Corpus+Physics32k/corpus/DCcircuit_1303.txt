The discovery of the relationship between magnetism and electricity was, like so many other
scientiﬁc discoveries, stumbled upon almost by accident. The Danish physicist Hans Christian
Oersted was lecturing one day in 1820 on the possibility of electricity and magnetism being
related to one another, and in the process demonstrated it conclusively by experiment in front
of his whole class! By passing an electric current through a metal wire suspended above a mag-
netic compass, Oersted was able to produce a deﬁnite motion of the compass needle in response
to the current. What began as conjecture at the start of the class session was conﬁrmed as fact
at the end. Needless to say, Oersted had to revise his lecture notes for future classes! His
serendipitous discovery paved the way for a whole new branch of science: electromagnetics.
