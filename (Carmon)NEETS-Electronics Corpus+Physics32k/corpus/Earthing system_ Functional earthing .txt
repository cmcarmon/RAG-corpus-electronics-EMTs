A functional earth connection serves a purpose other than electrical safety, and may carry current as part of normal operation. For example, in a single-wire earth return power distribution system, the earth forms one conductor of the circuit and carries all the load current. Other examples of devices that use functional earth connections include surge suppressors and electromagnetic interference filters.
