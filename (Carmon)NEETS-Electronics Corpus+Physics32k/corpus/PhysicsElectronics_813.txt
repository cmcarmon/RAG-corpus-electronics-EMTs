This arrangement is still pulse triggered. The data inputs are written onto the master ﬂip-
ﬂop while the clock is true and transferred to the slave when the clock becomes false. The
arrangement guarantees that the QQ outputs of the slave can never be connected to the
slave’s own RS inputs. The design overcomes signal racing (ie. the input signals never catch
up with the signals already in the ﬂip-ﬂop). There are however a few special states when a
transition can occur in the master and be transferred to the slave when the clock is high.
These are known as ones catching and are common in master/slave designs.
