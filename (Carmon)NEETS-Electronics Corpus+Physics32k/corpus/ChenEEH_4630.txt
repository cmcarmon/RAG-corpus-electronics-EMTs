In some cases, scheduling parameters are chosen to be
functions of the plant variables to make the problem more
tractable from a design standpoint. Because the scheduling
parameter is no longer independent of the plant variables
(e.g., qu=qx 6Â¼ 0), the closed-loop system formed by the lin-
earized plant and linear controllers does not match the linear-
ized closed-loop plant. The differences in the closed-loop
realizations are due to hidden coupling modes whose presence
may degrade or limit achievable performance. Although there
is no comprehensive theory for removing these modes from
the gain-scheduled design, examples are present in the litera-
ture (Nichols et al., 1993). As a rule, the designer must exhibit
additional caution in ensuring that the scheduling parameter
does not vary too rapidly.
