Low-Probability of Intercept (LPI). The opposite side of the AJ problem is that of LPI, that is, the desire to
hide your signal from detection by an intelligent adversary so that your transmissions will remain unnoticed
and, thus, neither jammed nor exploited in any manner. This idea of designing an LPI system is achieved in a
variety of ways, including transmitting at the smallest possible power level, and limiting the transmission time
to as short an interval in time as is possible. The choice of signal design is also important, however, and it is
here that spread spectrum techniques become relevant.
