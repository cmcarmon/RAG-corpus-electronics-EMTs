The  Lightpack  Cable  design,  pioneered  by  AT&T,  is  one  of  the  simplest  designs.  Several  ﬁbers  are  held
together  with  a  binder  to  form  a  unit.  One  or  more  units  are  laid  inside  a  large  tube,  which  is  ﬁlled  with  a
water-blocking compound. This design has the advantage of the loose tube design in that the ﬁbers are free of
strain, but is more compact. The tube-containing units can then be projected with various sheath options and
strength members to provide the ﬁnal cable.
