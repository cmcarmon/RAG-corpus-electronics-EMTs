Sunset (שְׁקִיעַת הַחַמָּה, Shkiyat Hachamah) is the time at which the ball of the sun falls below the horizon. The new day begins at this point for almost all purposes.

Mitzvot that must be performed during the day may no longer be performed ab initio. Minchah should not be delayed past now. Maariv may be recited now, although many wait until after nightfall.
