Saturation Region
For larger drain biases, the drain current saturates and be-
comes independent of the drain bias. Naturally, this region is
referred to as the saturation region. The drain current in
saturation is derived from the linear region current shown in
equation 3.18, which is a parabola with a maximum occurring
at VD, sat given by:3
