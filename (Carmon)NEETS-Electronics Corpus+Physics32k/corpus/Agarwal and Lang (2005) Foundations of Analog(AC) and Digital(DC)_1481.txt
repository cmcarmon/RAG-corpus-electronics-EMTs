a current through R. This current would deplete the charge on the capacitor,
till no charge exists.)
Next, the current impulse appears at t = 0. The capacitor behaves like
an instantaneous short to the current impulse, and so the current favors the
capacitor over the resistor. The entire impulse current flows through the capaci-
tor at t = 0, depositing charge Q on it. Corresponding to the appearance of
charge Q on the capacitor, from Equation 9.8, the capacitor voltage jumps
instantaneously to
