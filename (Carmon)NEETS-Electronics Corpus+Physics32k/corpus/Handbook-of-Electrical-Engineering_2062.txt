Science of interfacing between acoustical waves and corresponding electrical signals. This
includes  the  engineering  of  transducers  (e.g.,  loudspeakers  and  microphones),  but  also  parts  of  the
psychology of hearing, following the notion that it is not necessary to present to the ear signal components
that cannot be perceived.
