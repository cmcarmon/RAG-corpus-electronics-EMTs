Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) is a type of kinetic energy penetrator ammunition used to attack modern vehicle armour. As an armament for main battle tanks, it succeeds armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) ammunition, which is still used in small or medium caliber weapon systems.
Improvements in powerful automotive propulsion and suspension systems following World War Two allowed modern main battle tanks to incorporate progressively thicker and heavier armor protection systems, while maintaining considerable maneuverability and speed on the battlefield. As a result, achieving deep armor penetration with gun-fired ammunition required even longer anti-armor projectiles fired at even higher muzzle velocity than could be achieved with stubbier APDS projectiles.
