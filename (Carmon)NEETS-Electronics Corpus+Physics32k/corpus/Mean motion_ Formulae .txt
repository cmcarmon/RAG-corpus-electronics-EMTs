For Earth satellite orbital parameters, the mean motion is typically measured in revolutions per day. In that case,

{\displaystyle n={\frac {d}{2\pi }}{\sqrt {\frac {G(M+m)}{a^{3}}}}=d{\sqrt {\frac {G(M+m)}{4\pi ^{2}a^{3}}}}\,\!}

where
d is the quantity of time in a day,
G is the gravitational constant,
M and m are the masses of the orbiting bodies,
a is the length of the semi-major axis.
To convert from radians per unit time to revolutions per day, consider the following:

{\displaystyle {\rm {{\frac {radians}{time\ unit}}\times {\frac {1\ revolution}{2\pi \ radians}}\times }}{\frac {d\ {\rm {time\ units}}}{1{\rm {\ day}}}}={\frac {d}{2\pi }}{\rm {\ revolutions\ per\ day}}}

From above, mean motion in radians per unit time is:
