The relation defines a function of orbital parameters, conserved approximately when the third body is far from the second (perturbing) mass.

The relation is derived from the Jacobi constant selecting a suitable unit system and using some approximations. Traditionally, the units are chosen in order to make μ1 and the (constant) distance from μ2 to μ1 a unity, resulting in mean motion n also being a unity in this system.
In addition, given the very large mass of μ1 compared μ2 and μ3

{\displaystyle G(\mu _{1}+\mu _{2})\approx 1\approx G(\mu _{1}+\mu _{3})}

These conditions are satisfied for example for the Sun–Jupiter system with a comet or a spacecraft being the third mass.
The Jacobi constant, a function of coordinates ξ, η, ζ, (distances r1, r2 from the two masses) and the velocities remains the constant of motion through the encounter.

The goal is to express the constant using orbital parameters.
It is assumed, that far from the mass μ2, the test particle (comet, spacecraft) is on an orbit around μ1 resulting from two-body solution. First, the last term in the constant is the velocity, so it can be expressed, sufficiently far from the perturbing mass μ2, as a function of the distance and semi-major axis alone using vis-viva equation

Substituting these into the Jacobi constant CJ, ignoring the term with μ2<<1 and replacing r1 with r (given very large μ1 the barycenter of the system μ1, μ3 is very close to the position of μ1) gives
