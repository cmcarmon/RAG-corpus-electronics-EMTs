6.30 Noisy Channel Coding Theorem38
As the block length becomes larger, more error correction will be needed. Do codes exist that can correct
all errors? Perhaps the crowning achievement of Claude Shannon’s creation of information theory answers
this question. His result comes in two complementary forms: the Noisy Channel Coding Theorem and its
converse.
6.30.1 Statement of the Theorem
Let E denote the eﬃciency of an error-correcting code: the ratio of the number of data bits to the total
number of bits used to represent them. If the eﬃciency is less than the capacity of the digital channel, an
error-correcting code exists that has the property that as the length of the code increases, the probability of
an error occurring in the decoded block approaches zero.
