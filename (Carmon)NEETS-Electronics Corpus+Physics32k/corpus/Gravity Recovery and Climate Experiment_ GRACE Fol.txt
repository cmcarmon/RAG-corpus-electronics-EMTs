NASA and the GFZ Potsdam have announced a follow-on of the GRACE mission. The GRACE-FO mission will be a collaboration between NASA and GFZ and is scheduled to be launched on 28 April 2018 (UTC) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg AFB, California, sharing the launch with Iridium.
The orbit and the design of GRACE-FO will be very similar to GRACE. In addition to the proven microwave ranging system used on the GRACE mission, the distance between the two spacecraft of GRACE-FO will also be measured with laser ranging as a technological experiment in preparation for future satellites.
