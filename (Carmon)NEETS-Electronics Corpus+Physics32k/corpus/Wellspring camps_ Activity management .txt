The Wellspring Plan is based on the belief that, for weight controllers, simple, clear and easily measured goals help them stay focused. Research has shown that 10,000 steps of activity every day does such things as increase metabolic rate all day and accelerate metabolism of fat. Given that more than 85% of high school students fail to achieve 10,000 steps per day, this is a central goal of Wellspring's activity management program.
