depends  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the 
resources  available  to  you  and  whether  you  are 
building a ‘one-off’ prototype or a large number of 
identical circuits. The methods that are available to 
you include: 
 
Point-to-point wiring 
With  the  advent  of  miniature  components,  printed 
circuit boards and integrated circuits, point-to-point 
wiring construction is a construction technique that 
is  nowadays  considered  obsolete.  The  example  
shown  in  Fig.  19.1  is  the  underside  of  a  valve 
amplifier  chassis  dating  back  to  the  early  1960s. 
Unless you are dealing with a very small number of 
components  or  have  a  particular  desire  to  use  tag 
strips  and group  boards, point-to-point  wiring  is 
not  a  particularly  attractive  construction  method 
these days! 
 
Breadboard construction 
 
Breadboard  construction 
for 
assembling  and  testing  simple  circuit  prior  to 
production  of  a  more  permanent  circuit  using  a 
stripboard  or  printed  circuit  board.  The  advantage 
of this technique is that changes can be quickly and 
easily made to a circuit and all of the components 
can  be  re-used.  The  obvious  disadvantages  of 
breadboard construction are that it is unsuitable for 
permanent  use  and  also  unsuitable  for  complex 
circuits (i.e. circuits with more than half a dozen, or 
so,  active  devices  or  integrated  circuits).  Figure 
19.2 shows the simple bistable circuit that you met 
in Chapter 10 assembled and ready for testing. 
 
Matrix board construction 
 
Figure 19.3 shows matrix board construction. This 
low-cost  technique  avoids  the  need  for  a  printed 
circuit  but  is  generally  only  suitable  for  one-off 
prototypes. A matrix board consists of an insulated 
board into which a matrix of holes are drilled with 
copper tracks arranged as strips on the reverse side 
of the board. Component leads are inserted through
