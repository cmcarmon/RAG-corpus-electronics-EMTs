One of the first to perform this move on stage was Elvis Presley, which was quite controversial due to its obvious sexual connotations. Due to this controversy, he was sometimes shown (as seen on his third appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show) from the waist up on TV. Later pelvic thrust also became one of the signature moves of Michael Jackson. Twerking is also used as a dance move. The sideway pelvic thrust is a famous female dance move in Indian Bollywood called Thumka, it appears in lyrics of many songs.
