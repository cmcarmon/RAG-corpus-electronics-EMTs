constriction serves to determine the fricative sound produced.
Unvoiced fricatives include =f = (free), =T = (thick), =s= (cease),
=S= (mesh), and =h=8 (heat). The voiced fricatives =v= (vice),
=D= (then), =z= (zephyr), and =Z= (measure) are the voiced
counterparts of the unvoiced fricatives =f =, =T =, =s=, =S=, re-
spectively. Voiced fricatives possess the usual frication noise
source at the point of major constriction but also have periodic
glottal pulses exciting the vocal tract.
