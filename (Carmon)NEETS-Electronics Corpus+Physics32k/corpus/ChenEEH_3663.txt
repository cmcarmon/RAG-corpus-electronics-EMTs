The fricatives are produced by exciting the vocal tract with a
steady airstream that becomes turbulent at some point of con-
striction. The constriction in the vocal tract or glottis results in
an unvoiced excitation. However, some fricatives also have a
simultaneous voicing component (hence, mixed excitation).
Those with simple unvoiced excitation are usually called
unvoiced fricatives whereas those of mixed excitation are called
voiced fricatives. In the unvoiced case, the constriction causes a
noise source anterior to the constriction. The location of the
