input/output (i/o) instructions deal specifi-
cally with controlling I/O devices. The 8080A, 8085, 
and Z80 have I/O instructions. The 6800 and 6502 do 
not have specific I/O instructions. If a microprocessor 
uses an I/O instruction to deal with external devices, 
the technique is called an isolated I/O.
