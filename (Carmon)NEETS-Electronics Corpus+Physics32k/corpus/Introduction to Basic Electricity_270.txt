In	light	to	the	different	discussions	regarding	its	similarity	to	corrupt	hacking,	the
reverse	engineering	industry	is	subjected	to	various	legal	complaints.	There	are
even	laws	(that	usually	fall	under	contract	laws	and	fraudulent	manufacturing
laws)	meant	for	the	protection	of	all	sectors	that	employ	reversed	circuits	or
electronic	devices.
The	term	interoperability	is	introduced	in	relation	to	a	variety	of	legality	concerns.
With	the	emergence	of	cases	that	revolve	around	the	disassembly	of	circuit’s	parts
to	compromise	the	quality	of	a	circuit,	some	who	tackle	reverse	engineered	project
are	not	received	well.
Reverse	engineering	is,	therefore,	only	considered	illegal	if	the	primary	goal	is	to
achieve	interoperability.	If	the	goal	is	for	the	improvement	of	a	circuit’s	overall
performance,	it	is	encouraged;	along	with	almost	every	other	means	of	repairing	a
system,	it	is	even	recommended	to	arrive	at	a	desired	purpose.
