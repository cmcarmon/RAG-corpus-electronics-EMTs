The National University of Singapore has started making artificial muscle tissue to be able to be placed in mechanical arms to be able to help people pick up heavy loads. This artificial tissue can pick up to 500 times its own weight. Depending on how much of the tissue engineers place in the mechanical arm, the greater lift strength the arm has. A regular human well-grown adult weighs around 160 to 180 pounds. Now, a person weighing that much could be able to lift an object that weighs around 80,000 pounds. This would make construction sites a lot safer being able to just walk up with the construction supplies instead of using a crane that can collapse due to harsh weather. Soon, utility vehicles for construction may be a thing of the past.
