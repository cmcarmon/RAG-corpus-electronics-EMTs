If the target is moving with a component of velocity toward (or away) from the radar, then there will be a
Doppler frequency component added to (or subtracted from) the difference frequency (Fb), and the Doppler
will  be  slightly  higher  at  the  upper  end  of  the  sweep  range  than  at  the  lower  end.  This  will  introduce  an
