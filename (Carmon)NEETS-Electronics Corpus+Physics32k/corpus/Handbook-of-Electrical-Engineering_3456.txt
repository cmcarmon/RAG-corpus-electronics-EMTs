As will be discussed later in this chapter, in nearly all modes of heat transfer the geometry of the heat ﬂow path,
i.e., length and area, play an important role in determining the heat source temperature. Consequently, it is desirable
to obtain the relevant geometric details (lengths, thicknesses, areas, volumes) at this early stage in the design process.
Combining the geometric information with the target thermal resistance, it is often convenient to deﬁne an area-

), respectively.
