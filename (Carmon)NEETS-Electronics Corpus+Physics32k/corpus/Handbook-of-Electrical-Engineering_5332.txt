Photovoltaic  solar  cells  are  semiconductor  diodes  that  are  designed  to  abso rb  sunlight  and  convert  it  into
electricity.  The  absorption  of  sunlight  creates  free  minority  carriers,  which  determine  the  solar  cell  current.
These carriers are collected and separated by the junction of the diode, which determines the voltage. Photo-
voltaic solar cells have been the power supply of choice for satellites since 1958; 350 kilowatts of solar cells were
sold for space applications in 1998. The widespread use of photovoltaic solar cells for terrestrial applications
began during the oil crisis of 1973. The market for these solar cells has grown from 240 kilowatts in 1976 to
160 megawatts in 1998. Space solar cells cost approximately 100 times as much as terrestrial solar cells, so the
revenue difference between the two markets is not as great as the power generation difference.
