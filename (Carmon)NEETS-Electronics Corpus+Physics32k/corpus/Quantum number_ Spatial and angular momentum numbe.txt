Four quantum numbers can describe an electron in an atom completely. As per the following model, these nearly-compatible quantum numbers are:
Principal quantum number (n)
Azimuthal quantum number (â„“)
Magnetic quantum number (m)
Spin quantum number (sd)
The spin-orbital interaction, however, relates these numbers. Thus, a complete description of the system can be given with fewer quantum numbers, if orthogonal choices are made for these basis vectors.
