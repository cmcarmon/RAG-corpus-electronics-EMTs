Oedometer tests are designed to simulate the one-dimensional deformation and drainage conditions that soils experience in the field. To simulate these conditions, rigid confining rings are used to prevent lateral displacement of the soil sample. Porous stones are placed on the top and bottom of the sample to allow drainage in the vertical direction. To better simulate one-dimensional strain, a diameter-to-height ratio in the sample of 3:1 or more is used. Because the process of consolidation involves movement of water out of a soil, it is important to prevent drying of the soil.
