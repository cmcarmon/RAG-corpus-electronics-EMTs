Let's briefly review the properties of a capacitor. First, a capacitor opposes any change in voltage. 
The opposition to a change in current is called capacitive reactance (XC) and is measured in ohms. The 
capacitive reactance is determined by the frequency (f) of the applied voltage and the capacitance (C) of 
the capacitor.
