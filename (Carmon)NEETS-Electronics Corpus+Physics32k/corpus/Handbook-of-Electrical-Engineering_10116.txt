This conﬁguration has many advantages and is quite popular in industry. The conﬁguration was designed
speciﬁcally for assembly tasks [Truman, 1990], so has distinct advantages when applied in this area. Because
of the vertical orientation of the joints, gravity does not affect the dynamics of the ﬁrst two joints. In fact, for
these joints, the actuators can be shut off and the arm will not fall, even without the application of brakes. As
the name SCARA implies, this allows compliance in the horizontal directions to be selectively varied; therefore,
the robot can comply to horizontal forces. Horizontal compliance is important for vertical assembly operations.
Because of the vertical linear joint, straight-line vertical motions are simple. Also, SCARA robots typically have
high positional repeatability. The revolute joints allow high-speed motion. On the negative side, the resolution
of the arm is not constant throughout the workspace, and the kinematic equations are relatively complex. In
addition, the vertical motion of the SCARA conﬁguration is typically quite limited. While the SCARA robot
can reach around objects, it cannot reach over them in the same manner as an articulated arm.
