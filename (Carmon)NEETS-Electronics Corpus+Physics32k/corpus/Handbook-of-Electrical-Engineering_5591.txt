Directional Overcurrent Relays
When power systems become meshed, as for most subtransmission and high-voltage transmission networks,
inverse time overcurrent relays do not provide adequate protection under all conditions. The problem arises
because  the  fault  current  can  now  be  supplied  from  either  end  of  the  transmission  line,  and  discrimination
between faults inside and outside the zone of protection is not always possible. Consider the loop system shown
in Fig. 61.43. Notice that in this system there must be a circuit breaker at each end of the line, as a fault on the
line cannot be interrupted by opening one end alone. Zone A is the zone of protection for the line Aâ€“D. A fault
at F1 must be detected by the relays Rad and Rda. The current through the circuit breaker Bda for the fault F1
must be the determining quantity for the operation of the relay Rda. However, the impedances of the lines may
be such that the current through the breaker Bda for the fault F2 may be higher than the current for the fault
F1. Thus, if current magnitude alone is the criterion, the relay Rda would operate for fault F2, as well as for the
fault F1. Of course, operation of Rda for F2 is inappropriate, as it is outside its zone of protection, zone A. This
