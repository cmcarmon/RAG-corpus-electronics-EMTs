2. With the tool handles fully open, set the wire size selector knob to the proper position for the 
wire size being crimped. Slide the terminal lug locator down below the die surface into the fully 
retracted position. (See figure 2-24.) Slide the splice locator back into the retracted position. 
Insert the splice into the tool so that the "locating shoulder" on the side of the splice to be 
crimped is in the space between the two crimping dies. The insulation barrel on this side of the 
splice should protrude from the "wire side" of the tool. (See figure 2-24.) Slide the splice locator 
into the fully extended position. Insert the splice into the stationary die so that the locator 
"finger" fits into the locator groove in the splice.
