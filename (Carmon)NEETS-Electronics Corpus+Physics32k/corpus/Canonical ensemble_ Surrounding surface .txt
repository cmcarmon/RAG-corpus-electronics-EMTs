Ð¡anonical ensemble is a closed system, so its free energy contains surface terms. Therefore, strictly speaking, CE should be called the NVAT ensemble, where A is the area of the surrounding surface. If the partition function has no special surface potential terms, this is the surface of a hard solid.
