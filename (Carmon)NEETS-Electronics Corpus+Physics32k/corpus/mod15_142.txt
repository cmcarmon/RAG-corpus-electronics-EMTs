When the rotor of the CX in view A of figure 1-27 is turned 60ยบ clockwise, the magnetic field in the 
CX (black arrow) and the magnetic field in the CT (white arrow) also rotate 60ยบ clockwise. This action 
induces a voltage in the CT rotor that is in phase with the ac supply, as indicated by the oscilloscope 
presentation. If the rotor of the CX in view B is turned 60ยบ in a counterclockwise direction from its 0ยบ  
position, the magnetic field (white arrow) in the CT also rotates counterclockwise through the same 
number of degrees as the CX. Since the magnetic field in the stator of the CT cuts through the rotor in the 
opposite direction, the induced voltage in the rotor is now out of phase with the ac supply to the CX, as 
shown in the oscilloscope presentation.
