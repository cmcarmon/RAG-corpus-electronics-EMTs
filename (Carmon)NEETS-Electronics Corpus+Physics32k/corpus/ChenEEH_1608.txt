3. Knowledge analysis: The outputs from the know-
ledge extraction phase, such as concepts and heuristics,
are analyzed and represented in formal
forms,
frames, objects and rela-
including heuristic rules,
tions,
classiÔ¨Åcation schemes,
neural networks, and fuzzy logic sets. These representa-
tions are used in implementing a prototype expert
system.
