In central business districts of large urban areas, the primary distribution circuits consist of
underground cables which are used to interconnect the distribution transformers in an electric
network. With this exception, the primary system is most often radial. However, for additional
reliability and backup capability, a loop-radial conﬁguration is frequently used. The main feeder
is looped through the load area and brought back to the substation, and the two ends of the
loop are connected to the substation by two separate circuit breakers. For normal operation,
selected sectionalizing switches are opened so as to form a radial conﬁguration. Under fault
conditions, the faulted section is isolated and the rest of the loop is used to supply the unaffected
customers.
