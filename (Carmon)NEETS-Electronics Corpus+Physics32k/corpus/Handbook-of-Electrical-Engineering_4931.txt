Now, if l < j, the region of superconducting material greater than l from the boundary but less than j will
be higher in energy than that in the bulk of the material. Thus, the surface energy of the boundary is positive
and so costs the total system some energy. This class of superconductors is known as type I. Most elemental
superconductors, such as aluminum, tin, and lead, are type I. In addition to having l < j, type I superconductors
are  generally  characterized  by  low  critical  temperatures  (;5  K)  and  critical  ﬁelds  (;0.05  T).  Typical  type  I
superconductors and their properties are listed in Table 53.2.
