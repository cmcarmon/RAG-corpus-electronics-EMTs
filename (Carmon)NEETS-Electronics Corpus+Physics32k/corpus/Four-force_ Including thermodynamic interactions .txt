From the formulae of the previous section it appears that the time component of the four-force is the power expended,




f

⋅

u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }
, apart from relativistic corrections



γ

/

c


{\displaystyle \gamma /c}
. This is only true in purely mechanical situations, when heat exchanges vanish or can be neglected.
If the full thermo-mechanical case, not only work, but also heat contributes to the change in energy, which is the time component of the energy–momentum covector. The time component of the four-force includes in this case a heating rate



h


{\displaystyle h}
, besides the power




f

⋅

u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }
. Note that work and heat cannot be meaningfully separated, though, as they both carry inertia.
Therefore, in thermo-mechanical situations the time component of the four-force is not proportional to the power




f

⋅

u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }
but has a more generic expression, to be given case by case, which represents the supply of internal energy from the combination of work and heat, and which in the Newtonian limit becomes



h
+

f

⋅

u



{\displaystyle h+\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }
.
