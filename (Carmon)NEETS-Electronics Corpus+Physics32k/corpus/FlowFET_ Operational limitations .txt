Variation of the FlowFET dimensions (e.g. insulating layer thickness between the channel wall and gate electrode) due to the manufacturing process can lead to inexact control of the zeta potential. This can be exacerbated in the case of wall contamination, which can alter the channel wall surface's electrical properties adjacent to the gate electrode. This will affect the local flow characteristics, which may be especially important in chemical synthesis systems whose stoichiometry are directly related to the transport rate of reaction precursors and reaction products.
There are constraints placed on the fluid that can be manipulated in a FlowFET. Since it relies on EOF, only fluids producing an EOF in response to an applied electric field may be used.
While the controlling voltage need only be on the order of 50V, the EOF-producing voltage along the channel axis is larger, on the order of 300V. It is noticed experimentally that electrolysis may occur at the electrode contacts. This water electrolysis can alter the pH in the channel and adversely affect biological cells and biomolecules, while gas bubbles tend to "clog" microfluidic systems.
In further analogy with microelectronic systems, the switching time for a flowFET is inversely proportional to its size. Scaling down a flowFET results in a reduction in the amount of time for the flow to equilibrate to a new flow rate following a change in the applied electrical field. It should be noted, however, that the frequency of flowFET is many orders of magnitude slower than with an electronic FET.
