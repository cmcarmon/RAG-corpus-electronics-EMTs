Figure 2-15 illustrates the relationship between radio waves and ionization density. Each ionized 
layer has a central region of relatively dense ionization, which tapers off in intensity both above and 
below the maximum region. As a radio wave enters a region of INCREASING ionization, the increase in 
velocity of the upper part of the wave causes it to be bent back TOWARD the Earth. While the wave is in 
the highly dense center portion of the layer, however, refraction occurs more slowly because the density 
of ionization is almost uniform. As the wave enters into the upper part of the layer of DECREASING 
ionization, the velocity of the upper part of the wave decreases, and the wave is bent AWAY from the 
Earth.
