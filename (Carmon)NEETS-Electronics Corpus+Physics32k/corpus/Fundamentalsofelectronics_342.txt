Solution to Exercise 3.12 (p. 52)
For maximum power dissipation, the imaginary part of complex power should be zero. As the complex power
is given by V I∗ = |V ||I|ej(φ−θ), zero imaginary part occurs when the phases of the voltage and currents
agree.
Solution to Exercise 3.13 (p. 52)
Pave = VrmsIrms cos (φ − θ). The cosine term is known as the power factor.
Solution to Exercise 3.14 (p. 56)
The key notion is writing the imaginary part as the diﬀerence between a complex exponential and its complex
conjugate:
