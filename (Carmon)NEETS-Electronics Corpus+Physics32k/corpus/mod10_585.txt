A tremendous amount of knowledge and information has been gained about the design of antennas 
and radio-wave propagation. Still, many old-time technicians will tell you that when it comes to designing 
the length of an antenna, the best procedure is to perform all calculations and try out the antenna. If it 
doesn't work right, use a cut-and-try method until it does. Fortunately, enough information has been 
collected over the last few decades that it is now possible to predict the behavior of antennas. This chapter 
will discuss and explain the basic design and operation of antennas.
