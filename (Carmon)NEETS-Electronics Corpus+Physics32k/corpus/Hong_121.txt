Feedback loops can be either negative or positive. If the feedback loop serves to 
decrease the effect of the input, then the feedback is said to be negative. Conversely, if 
the feedback loop serves to increase the effect of the input, then the feedback is said to be 
positive. In most instances, negative feedback results in a stable output response whereas 
positive feedback results an unstable or oscillatory response.
