Core and Shell Types
Transformers are constructed in either a shell or a core structure. The shell-type transformer is one where the
windings are completely surrounded by transformer steel in the plane of the coil. Core- type transformers are
those that are not shell type. A power transformer is shown in Fig. 64.1.
