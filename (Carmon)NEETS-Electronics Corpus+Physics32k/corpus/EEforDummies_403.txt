temporarily for later use. Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) and 
alarm clocks keep charged capacitors on hand in case there’s a power 
failure. The energy stored in the capacitor is released the moment the 
charging circuit is disconnected (which it will be if the power goes out!).
Cameras use capacitors for temporary storage of the energy used to 
generate the flash, and many electronic devices use capacitors to supply 
energy while the batteries are being changed. Car audio systems com-
monly use capacitors to supply energy when the amplifier needs more 
than the car’s electrical system can give. Without a capacitor in your 
system, every time you hear a heavy bass note, your lights would dim!
