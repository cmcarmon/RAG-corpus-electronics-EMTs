By integrating the differential form over the material's total surface



S


{\displaystyle S}
, we arrive at the integral form of Fourier's law:







∂
Q


∂
t



=
−
k


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial Q}{\partial t}}=-k}





S



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle S}





∇

T
⋅

d
S


{\displaystyle {\nabla }T\cdot \,dS}

where (including the SI units):












∂
Q


∂
t










{\displaystyle {\big .}{\frac {\partial Q}{\partial t}}{\big .}}
is the amount of heat transferred per unit time (in W), and




d
S


{\displaystyle dS}
is an oriented surface area element (in m2)
The above differential equation, when integrated for a homogeneous material of 1-D geometry between two endpoints at constant temperature, gives the heat flow rate as:











Q

Δ
t



=
−
k
A



Δ
T


Δ
x





{\displaystyle {\big .}{\frac {Q}{\Delta t}}=-kA{\frac {\Delta T}{\Delta x}}}

where




A


{\displaystyle A}
is the cross-sectional surface area,




Δ
T


{\displaystyle \Delta T}
is the temperature difference between the ends,




Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}
is the distance between the ends.
This law forms the basis for the derivation of the heat equation.
