2/S
in Figure 13.2.8 is a maximum. Applying the familiar impedance-matching principle of circuit
(cid:7)
2/S equals the magnitude of the
theory, this power will be a maximum when the impedance R
impedance between that and the constant voltage V1a. That is to say, the maximum occurs at a
value of slip Smax T for which the following condition is satisÔ¨Åed:
