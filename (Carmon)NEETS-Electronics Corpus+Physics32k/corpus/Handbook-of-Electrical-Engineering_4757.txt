Typical values of 
 are 0.7 for PZT 4 and 0.09 for quartz, showing that PZT is a much more efﬁcient transducer
k
material than quartz. Note that the energy is a scalar; the subscripts are assigned by ﬁnding the energy conversion
k
coefﬁcient for a speciﬁc vibrational mode and ﬁeld direction and selecting the subscripts accordingly. Thus 
refers to the coupling factor for a longitudinal mode driven by a longitudinal ﬁeld.
