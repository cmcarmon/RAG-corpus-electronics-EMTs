As the demand for user mobility increases, a userâ€™s need to
carry a lightweight handheld personal computer and to be able
to access information on the Internet increases as well. Hard-
ware resources, communication bandwidth, and network con-
nectivity available to this type of personal computer are
extremely limited so that currently available operating systems
running on such machines will not be able to achieve the best
performance. Designing a new technology to accommodate
this mobile computing environment becomes a new challenge
to the operating system research.
