Much  experience  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  satisfactory  linear  systems  control  design  using  frequency
response  approaches  is  such  that  the  crossover  frequency  occurs  on  a  gain  magnitude  curve  which  has  a  –1
slope at the crossover frequency. In the vicinity of crossover we may approximate any minimum phase transfer
function, with crossover on a –1 slope, by
