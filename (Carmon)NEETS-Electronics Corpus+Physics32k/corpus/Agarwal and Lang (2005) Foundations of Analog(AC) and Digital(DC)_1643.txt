Then, during the second half cycle, the same charge is transferred from the capacitor to
ground. Effectively, a charge Q L is transferred from the power source to ground during
each cycle. The amount of energy lost during this transfer is given by VSQ L. We divide
this quantity by T to obtain the average power. Thus,
pdynamic = VSQ L/T
= VSC LVS/T
= fC LV2
