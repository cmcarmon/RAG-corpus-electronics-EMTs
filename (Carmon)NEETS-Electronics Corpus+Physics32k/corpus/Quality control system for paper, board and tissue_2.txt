The requirements for an ideal paper machine online sensor include the following: the sensor is calibrated to a natural constant during the measurement; the sensor and the related electronics include fault diagnostics; digital processing of the signal is possible from the start without destroying the possibility of analyzing large frequency components; the sensor system does not disturb the production; the measurements are performed real-time and can be adjusted without delays; the measurement concerns the entire production, not just small sample values. It must be possible to distinguish between the machine-directional and cross-directional deviation and the residual deviation as the control system handles these three deviations separately and in different ways. The earlier systems calculated a long-term average profile to filter the profile. As several quality profiles can be adjusted automatically it is important to get the right profile data with high resolution quickly to the control system. This is especially important during changes, after breaks and during grade changes. In advanced systems, algorithms are used to calculate the profile data.
