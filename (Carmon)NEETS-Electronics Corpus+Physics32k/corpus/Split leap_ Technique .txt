Split leaps and split jumps require significant flexibility and strength. Flexibility and strength are both needed to attain a split position without the aid of external leg support. Also, in order to remain airborne while in the split position, strength is needed to propel the body upward with sufficient kinetic energy to compensate for the loss of vertical momentum that results from raising the legs into a split position while airborne.
In dance, the perceived quality of a split leap or split jump depends in large part on the application of various dance techniques. In particular, emphasis is often placed on pointing the feet while airborne, especially during the split, so as to extend the leg lines. Also, proper technique (i.e., best practice) typically calls for straight legs (except in stag variations) and a full split position at the apex of the leap or jump. Ballon, which is the appearance of effortless and weightless movement, is another important aesthetic. There are, however, variations that run counter to traditional dance techniques. For example, the feet may be intentionally oriented at right angles to the legs to produce a notable, unusual aesthetic.
