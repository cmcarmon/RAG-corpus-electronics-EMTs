Most circuit analyses are effectively carried out on circuits containing only
two-terminal elements. This is due in part to the common use of two-terminal
elements, and in part to the fact that most, if not all, elements having more
than two terminals are usually modeled using combinations of two-terminal
elements. Thus, two-terminal elements appear prominently in all electronic
