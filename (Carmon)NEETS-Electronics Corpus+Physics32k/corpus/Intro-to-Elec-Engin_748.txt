The gain is willingly sacriﬁced in exchange for the beneﬁts of negative feedback. Compen-
sating networks are often employed to ensure stability. A voltage ampliﬁer with negative feedback
is shown by the generalized block diagram in Figure 8.5.3. The negative feedback creates a self-
correcting ampliﬁcation system that compensates for the shortcomings of the amplifying unit.
The gain with feedback can be seen to be
