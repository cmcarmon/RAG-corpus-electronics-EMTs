d.c.  range  to  measure  the  d.c.  voltage  at  the 
junction  of  R6  and  R7.  Adjust  RV1  so  that  this 
voltage  is  exactly  half  that  of  the  supply  (i.e.  
8.5 V). 
  Now  remove 
the  digital 
multimeter set to the 200 mA d.c. range to measure 
the  collector  current  for  TR3.  Adjust  RV2  for  a 
current  of  exactly  24  mA.  Repeat  these  two 
adjustments  until  no  further  change  is  noted. 
Replace  the  link  and  set  the  digital  multimeter  to 
the  20  V  d.c.  range.  Measure  the  d.c.  voltages 
present  at  the  collector,  base  and  emitter  of  TR1, 
TR2 and TR3. Also measure the d.c. voltage at the 
anode 
cathode  of  D1.  Record  your 
measurements in a table.  
  Connect the  AF signal generator to the input of 
the amplifier and set the output to 200 mV pk-pk at 
1 kHz sine wave. Set the Channel 1 and Channel 2 
inputs  of  the  oscilloscope  to  100  mV/cm  with  the 
a.c.-d.c.-ground  switches  in  the  a.c.  position.  Set 
the trigger to internal and the timebase to  1ms/cm.  
Display  the  waveforms  at  the  input  and  output  of 
the  amplifier  and  sketch  these  using  the  layout 
shown in Fig. 14.36.
