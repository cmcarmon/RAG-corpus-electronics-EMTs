Consider the reversed configuration, namely, frame Σ moves with velocity −u relative to frame Σ′, and frame Σ′, in turn, moves with velocity −v relative to frame Σ′′. In short, u → − u and v → −v by EPVR. Then the velocity of Σ relative to Σ′′ is (−v) ⊕ (−u) ≡ −v ⊕ u. By EPVR again, the velocity of Σ′′ relative to Σ is then wi = v ⊕ u. (A)
One finds wd ≠ wi. While they are equal in magnitude, there is an angle between them. For a single boost between two inertial frames, there is only one unambiguous relative velocity (or its negative). For two boosts, the peculiar result of two inequivalent relative velocities instead of one seems to contradict the symmetry of relative motion between any two frames. Which is the correct velocity of Σ′′ relative to Σ? Since this inequality may be somewhat unexpected and potentially breaking EPVR, this question is warranted.
