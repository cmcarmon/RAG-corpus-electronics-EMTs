the vector addition of coherent signals scattered back to the receiver from various reﬂecting surfaces. At some
angles the vectors may add in phase (constructively) and at others they may cancel, and the effect is speciﬁcally
dependent on wavelength. For a narrowband system, glint may provide a very large signal change over a small
variation of angle, but, of course, at another wavelength it would be different. Thus, very wide bandwidth is
desirable from this smoothing point of view, and typical numbers used in millimeter-wave radars are in the
450- to 650-MHz range. Piper chose 480 MHz.
