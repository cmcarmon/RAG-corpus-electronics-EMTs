12.1.1 (a) Show by applying Ampere’s circuital law
that the magnetic ﬁeld associated with a long
straight, current-carrying wire is given by
Bφ = µ0I /(2π r), where the subscript φ de-
notes the φ-component in the circular cylin-
drical coordinate system, µ0 is the free-space
permeability, I is the current carried by the
wire, and r is the radius from the current-
carrying wire. What is the net force on the
wire due to the interaction of the B-ﬁeld
(produced by the current I) and the current I?
