Therefore, the charge density in the depletion region is a weak
function of the surface potential. Consequently, when the gate
bias is further increased beyond the value required to reach
strong inversion, the extra positive charge on the gate can be
easily compensated by new electrons in the inversion layer.
This eliminates the need to uncover additional acceptor
atoms in the depletion region. After this point, the depletion
region width and, hence, the band bending can increase only
