Resolution and Accuracy
The fundamental resolution capabilities of a radar system are summarized in Table 41.5. In general, there is a
trade-off between mainlobe resolution corresponding to the nominal range, Doppler, and angle resolution, and
effective  dynamic  range  corresponding  to  suppression  of  sidelobe  components.  This  is  evident  in  the  use  of
weighting to suppress Doppler sidebands and angle sidelobes at the expense of broadening the mainlobe and
N
 loss.

Cross range denotes either of the two dimensions orthogonal to the radar line of sight. Cross-range resolution
in real-aperture antenna systems is closely approximated by the product of target range and radar beamwidth
in  radians.  Attainment  of  the  nominal  ISAR/SAR  cross-range  resolution  generally  requires  complex  signal
processing to generate a focused image, including correction for scatterer change in range over the CPI.
