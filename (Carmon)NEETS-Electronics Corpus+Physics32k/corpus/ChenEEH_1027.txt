Actually, addressing the power problem from the very early
stages of design development offers enhanced opportunities to
obtain signiﬁcant reductions of the power budget and to avoid
costly redesign steps. Power-conscious design ﬂows must then
be adopted; these require, at each level of the design hierarchy,
the exploration of different alternatives as well as the availability
of power estimation tools that could provide accurate feedback
on the quality of each design choice (Benini and de Micheli,
1999). This section studies the various techniques that can be
effectively used to reduce the power consumption during the
VSLI system design cycle. The stages during the design involve
the system, architectural, logic, circuit, and physical levels.
