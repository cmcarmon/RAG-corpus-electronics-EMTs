Besides fixed-wing aircraft, applications for wing shapes include:
Hang gliders, which use wings ranging from fully flexible (paragliders, gliding parachutes), flexible (framed sail wings), to rigid
Kites, which use a variety of lifting surfaces
Flying model airplanes
Helicopters, which use a rotating wing with a variable pitch angle to provide directional forces
Propellers, whose blades generate lift for propulsion.
The NASA Space Shuttle, which uses its wings only to glide during its descent to a runway. These types of aircraft are called spaceplanes.
Some racing cars, especially Formula One cars, which use upside-down wings (or airfoils) to provide greater traction at high speeds
Sailboats, which use sails as vertical wings with variable fullness and direction to move across water
