Horizontal Microinstructions
Each of the ﬁelds f of a microinstruction speciﬁes a microcommand. If the format of the microinstruction is
such that all possible microcommands can be speciﬁed, the instruction is called horizontal. Most of the time,
it  is  wasteful  in  memory  as,  in  a  microprogram,  not  every  possible  microcommand  is  speciﬁed  in  each
microinstruction. However, it permits the microprogrammer to fully take advantage of all possible parallelisms
and to build faster machines.
