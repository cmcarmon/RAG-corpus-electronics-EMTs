The rf energy is transmitted into space in the form of an electromagnetic field. As the traveling 
electromagnetic field arrives at the receiving antenna, a voltage is induced into the antenna (a conductor). 
The rf voltages induced into the receiving antenna are then passed into the receiver and converted back 
into the transmitted rf information.
