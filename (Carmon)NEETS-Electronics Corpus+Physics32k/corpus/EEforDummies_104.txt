Creating good vibrations
Electronic components in your iPod, car stereo, and other audio systems 
convert electrical energy into sound energy. In each case, the system’s 
speakers are the load, or destination, for electrical energy. The job of the 
electronic components in the system is to “shape” the current flowing to the 
speakers so that the diaphragm within each speaker moves in such a way as 
to reproduce the original sound.
