The variable capacitance property of the varactor allows it to be used in circuit applications, such as 
amplifiers, that produce much lower internal noise levels than circuits that depend upon resistance 
properties. Since noise is of primary concern in receivers, circuits using varactors are an important 
development in the field of low-noise amplification. The most significant use of varactors to date has 
been as the basic component in parametric amplifiers.
