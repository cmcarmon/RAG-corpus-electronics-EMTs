HRCI-R or Class R fuses were developed in the United States. Originally constructed to Standard or Class H
fuse dimensions, they were classiﬁed as Class K and are available in the United States with two levels of short-
circuit  performance  characteristics:  Class  K1  and  Class  K5.  However,  they  are  not  recognized  in  Canadian
Standards. Under fault conditions, Class K1 fuses limit the Ip and  I 2t to lower levels than do Class K5 fuses.
Since  both  Class  K1  and  K5  are  constructed  to  Standard  or  Class  H  fuse  dimensions,  problems  with  inter-
changeability occur. As a result, a second generation of these K fuses was therefore introduced with a rejection
feature incorporated in the end caps and blade contacts. This rejection feature, when used in conjunction with
rejection-style fuse clips, prevents replacement of these fuses with Standard or Class H 10-kA I.R. fuses. These
rejection style fuses are known as Class RK1 and Class RK5. They are available with time-delay or non-time-
delay characteristics and with voltage ratings of 250 or 600 V and ampere ratings up to 600 A. In Canada, CSA
has only one classiﬁcation for these fuses, HRCI-R, which have the same maximum Ip and  I 2t current-limiting
levels as speciﬁed by UL for Class RK5 fuses.
