The	Dark	LED	Light	is	a	circuit	project	that	can	detect	darkness.	It	follows
that	when	insufficient	light	is	supplied,	an	IC	timer	is	alerted;	consequently,
a	high	output	is	produced	and	LED	light	will	be	switched	on.	The	idea
behind	it	is	similar	to	that	of	a	street	light	that	automatically	turns	on	once
it	detects	that	itâ€™s	already	evening.
