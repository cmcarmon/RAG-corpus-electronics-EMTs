The SCR is turned on by a positive input gate volt-
age and turned off by reducing the anode-to- cathode 
voltage to 0. When the SCR is turned on and is 
 conducting a high cathode-to-anode current, it is con-
ducting in the forward direction. If the polarity of the 
cathode-to-anode bias voltage is reversed, only a small 
leakage current flows in the reverse direction.
