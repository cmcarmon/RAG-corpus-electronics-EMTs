F I G U R E 8.39 Source-follower
small-signal model. gm, the
transconductance of the MOSFET,
is given by K(VGS âˆ’ VT), where
VGS is the operating-point value of
the gate-to-source voltage for the
MOSFET. (See Example 7.8 or
Problem 7.5 in Chapter 7 to see
how the operating-point param-
eters of the source follower can be
calculated.)
