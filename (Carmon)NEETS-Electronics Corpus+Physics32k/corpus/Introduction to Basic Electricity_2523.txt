The vertical block consists of a vertical input jack, 
an AC/DC switch, and a volts/cm rotary switch. The 
oscilloscope probe is connected to the input jack.  
The probe is then connected to the circuit to be tested. 
The AC/DC switch allows the signal to be sent directly 
to the vertical amplifier in the DC position or to a 
 capacitor in the AC position. The capacitor in the AC 
position is used to block any DC component on the
