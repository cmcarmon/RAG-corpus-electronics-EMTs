To provide the learning controller measured states as
inputs to the action and the critic networks, the cartâ€“pole
system was simulated on a digital computer using a detailed
model that includes all of the nonlinearities and reactive
forces of the physical system such as frictions. Note that these
simulated states would be the measured ones in real-time
applications.
