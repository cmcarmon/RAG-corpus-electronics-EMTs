Cartesian Conﬁguration
The Cartesian conﬁguration consists of three orthogonal, linear
axes, abbreviated as PPP, as shown in Fig. 101.1. Thus, the joint
space of the robot corresponds directly with the standard right-
-coordinate  system,  yielding  the  simplest
handed  Cartesian 
possible kinematic equations. The work envelope of the Carte-
sian robot is shown in Fig. 101.2. The work envelope encloses all
the points that can be reached by the robot arm or the mounting
point for the end-effector or tool. The area reachable by an end
effector or tool is not considered part of the work envelope. All
interaction  with  other  machines,  parts,  or  processes  must  take
place within this volume [Critchlow, 1985]. Here, the workspace
of a robot is assumed to be equivalent to the work envelope.
