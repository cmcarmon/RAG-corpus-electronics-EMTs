An essential skill to have is a ready and intuitive understanding of how component faults
affect circuits in different conﬁgurations. We will explore some of the effects of component
faults in both series and parallel circuits here, then to a greater degree at the end of the
”Series-Parallel Combination Circuits” chapter.
