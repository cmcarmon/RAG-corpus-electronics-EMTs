The above expression for vapour quality can be expressed as:




χ
=



y
−

y

f





y

g


−

y

f







{\displaystyle \chi ={\frac {y-y_{f}}{y_{g}-y_{f}}}}

where



y


{\displaystyle y}
is equal to either specific enthalpy, specific entropy, specific volume or specific internal energy,




y

f




{\displaystyle y_{f}}
is the value of the specific property of saturated liquid state and




y

g


−

y

f




{\displaystyle y_{g}-y_{f}}
is the value of the specific property of the substance in dome zone, which we can find both liquid




y

f




{\displaystyle y_{f}}
and vapor




y

g




{\displaystyle y_{g}}
.
Another expression of the same concept is:




χ
=



m

v




m

l


+

m

v







{\displaystyle \chi ={\frac {m_{v}}{m_{l}+m_{v}}}}

where




m

v




{\displaystyle m_{v}}
is the vapour mass and




m

l




{\displaystyle m_{l}}
is the liquid mass.
