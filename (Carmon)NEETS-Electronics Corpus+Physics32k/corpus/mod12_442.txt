excessive amplitude variations from signals. The collector circuit tank consists of C1 and L1. C2 and L2
form the secondary tank circuit. Both tank circuits are tuned to the center frequency of the incoming fm
signal. Choke L3 is the dc return path for diode rectifiers CR1 and CR2. R1 and R2 are not always
necessary but are usually used when the back (reverse bias) resistance of the two diodes is different.
Resistors R3 and R4 are the load resistors and are bypassed by C3 and C4 to remove rf. C5 is the output
coupling capacitor.
