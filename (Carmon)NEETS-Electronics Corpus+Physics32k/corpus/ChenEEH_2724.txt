The dispersion analysis presented in the previous subsection is
now extended to the full three-dimensional case, following
the analysis presented by Taﬂove and Brodwin (1975a). We
consider a normalized, lossless region of space with m ¼ 1,
e ¼ 1, s ¼ 0, s ¼ 0, and c ¼ 1. Letting j ¼
, we rewrite
Maxwell’s equations in compact form as:
