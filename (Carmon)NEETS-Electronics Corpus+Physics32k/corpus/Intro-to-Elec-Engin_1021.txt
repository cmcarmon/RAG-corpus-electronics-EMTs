This principle is often used in the analysis of single-phase machines. The two rotating ﬂuxes
are considered separately, as if each represented the rotating ﬂux of a polyphase machine, and
the effects are then superimposed. If the system is linear, the principle of superposition holds
and yields correct results. In a nonlinear system with saturation, however, one must be careful in
reaching conclusions since the results are not as obvious as in a linear system.
