The supplementary control system as described above reﬂects
AGC operation more or less as it has existed since the advent of
computer controls in the late 1960s. Recent moves to deregu-
late the power system and open up the system to competition
greatly complicate the traditional control philosophy. In an
open market, the load responsibilities are not so clearly deﬁned
or geographically restricted. For example, an independent
generator may have a contract to serve a load in a neighboring
control area, and this impacts the scheduled ﬂows on the
intertie. A number of methods have been proposed to facilitate
this control, including the establishment of a separate market
for a ‘‘load-following’’ service. Consumers would pay for this
service along with their energy fee. No regions in the world
have fully opened AGC control to market competition, but
many incremental steps have been taken. So while the supply
of energy has proven to be amenable to economic competition,
the vagaries of control are more difﬁcult to formulate as an
open transparent market.
