The pulses applied to the counting circuit must be of the same time duration if accurate frequency 
division is to be made. Counting circuits are generally preceded by shaping circuits and limiting circuits 
(both discussed in this chapter) to ensure uniformity of amplitude and pulse width. Under those 
conditions, the pulse repetition frequency is the only variable and frequency variations may be measured.
