The induction machine rotor may be one of two types: the wound rotor or the squirrel-cage
rotor. The wound rotor has a polyphase winding similar to and wound for the same number of
poles as the stator winding. The terminals of the rotor winding (wye- or delta-connected, in the
case of three-phase machines) are brought to insulated slip rings mounted on the shaft. Carbon
brushes bearing on these slip rings make the rotor terminals available to the circuitry external to
