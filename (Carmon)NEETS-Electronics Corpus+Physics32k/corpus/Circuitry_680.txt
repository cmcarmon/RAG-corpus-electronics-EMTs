This usually takes the form of a switch that determines whether triggering occurs on the positive 
or negative going edge of  the triggering signal. 
This switch allows selection of one of several waveforms for use as the timebase trigger. The 
options usually include an internal signal derived from the vertical amplifier, a 50 Hz signal 
derived from the supply mains, and a signal which may be applied to an External Trigger input.
