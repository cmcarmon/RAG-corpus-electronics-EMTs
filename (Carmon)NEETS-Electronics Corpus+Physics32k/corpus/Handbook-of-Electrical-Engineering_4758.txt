Probably the most important applications of PZT today are based on ultrasonic echo ranging. Sonar uses
the conversion of electrical signals to mechanical displacement as well as the reverse transducer property, which
is to generate electrical signals in response to a stress wave. Medical diagnostic ultrasound and nondestructive
testing systems devices rely on the same properties. Actuators have also been built but a major obstacle is the
small displacement which can conveniently be generated. Even then, the required voltages are typically hundreds
