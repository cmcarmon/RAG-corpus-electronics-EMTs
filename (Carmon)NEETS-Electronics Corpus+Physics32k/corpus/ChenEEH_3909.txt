The fundamental problems of statistical signal processing
are those of signal detection and estimation that aim to extract
information from the received signals and help make decisions.
The received signals (especially those in communication
systems) are typically modeled as random processes due to
the existence of uncertainties. The uncertainties usually arise in
the process of signal propagation or due to noise in measure-
ments. Since signals are considered random, statistical tools are
needed. As such, techniques derived to solve those problems
are derived from the principles of mathematical statistics,
namely, hypothesis testing and estimation.
