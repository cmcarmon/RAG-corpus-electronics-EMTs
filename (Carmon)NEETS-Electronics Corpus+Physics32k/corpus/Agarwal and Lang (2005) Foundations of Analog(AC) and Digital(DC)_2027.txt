2. A frequency at which |H( jω)| falls to 1/
2 or 0.707 of its maximum value is called a 0.707
frequency or ω0.707. As defined for first-order circuits in Chapter 13, such a frequency is also called
a half power frequency. Since 0.707 in decibels is 20 log(0.707) = −3dB, it is also called a −3dB
frequency.
