Voltage measurements provide a means of checking circuit conditions in a transistorized circuit just
as they do in checking conditions in a tube circuit. The voltages, however, are much lower than in a tube
circuit. The bias voltage between the base and emitter, for instance, is usually 0.05 to 0.20 volts. When
making checks, observe polarity.
