As you can see, varying the grid by only 6 volts has caused the output of the triode to vary by 100
volts. The input signal voltage has been amplified (or increased) by a factor of 16.6. This factor is an
expression of amplifier VOLTAGE GAIN and is calculated by dividing the output signal voltage by the
input signal voltage.
