 of light sensors known as charge-coupled devices. The image is formed
by examining the output of each sensor in a preset order for a ﬁnite time. The electronics of the system then forms
an electrical signal which produces an image that is shown on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display. The image is
formed because there is an array of sensors, each one examining only one spatial location of the region to be sensed.
. Scanning
is the typical method used to convert a two-dimensional energy signal or image to a one-dimensional electrical
signal that can be handled by the computer. (An image can be thought of as an energy ﬁeld with spatial extent.)

Another form of scanning is used in ultrasonic imaging. In this application there is 
an  array  of  sensors.  The  ultrasound  transducer  is  moved  or  steered  (either  mechanically  or  electrically)  to
various spatial locations on the patient’s chest or stomach. As the sensor is moved to each location, the output
electrical signal of the sensor is sampled and the  electronics of  the system  then form a television-like signal
which is displayed. Nearly all the transducers used in imaging form an image by either using an array of sensors
or a single sensor that is moved to each spatial location.
