The desire of the purchaser is to obtain a transformer at a
reasonable price that will achieve the required performance
for an extended period of time. The desire of the manufacturer
is to construct and sell a product, at a proﬁt, that meets the
customer’s goals. The speciﬁcation and purchase contract com-
bines both the purchaser’s requirements and manufacturer’s
commitment in a legal format. The speciﬁcation will typically
address the transformer’s service condition, rating, general con-
struction, control and protection, design and performance
review, testing requirements, and transportation and handling.
Since it is impossible to address all issues in a speciﬁcation, the
industry uses standards that are acceptable to purchaser and
supplier. In the case of power transformers, the applicable
standard would include IEEE C57, IEC 76, and NEMA TR-1.
