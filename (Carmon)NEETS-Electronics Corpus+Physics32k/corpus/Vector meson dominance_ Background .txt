Measurements of the interaction between energetic photons and hadrons show that the interaction is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's electric charge. Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons in spite of the fact that the electric charge structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different.
According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon (which interacts only with electric charges) and vector meson.
Just after 1970, when more accurate data on the above processes became available, some discrepancies with the VMD predictions appeared and new extensions of the model were published. These theories are known as Generalized Vector Meson Dominance theories (GVMD).
