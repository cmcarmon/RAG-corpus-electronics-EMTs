Chance: 10100 years to 10200 years
In the event that the proton does not decay according to the GUT theories above, the Degenerate Era will last longer, and will overlap or surpass the Black Hole Era. However, degenerate stellar objects can still experience proton decay, for example via processes involving virtual black hole, or higher-dimension supersymmetry with a half-life of under 10200 years.
