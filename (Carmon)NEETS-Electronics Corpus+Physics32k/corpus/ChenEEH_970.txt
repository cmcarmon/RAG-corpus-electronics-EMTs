A quadratic programming formulation of the clock skew
scheduling problem was developed in Section 4.3. This QP
problem can be efﬁciently solved by applying the mathematical
procedures developed in Section 4.4. Algorithm CSD as ap-
plied to the QP problem described in Section 5.4.3 has been
implemented as a C þ þ program and applied to ISCAS’89
and ISCAS’93 benchmark circuits as well as to industrial
circuits (IC1, IC2, and IC3). Results from the application of
this computer program are described in this section. Certain
characteristics of the implementation are initially described in
Section 4.6.1. Graphical illustrations of representative results
are shown in Section 4.6.2.
