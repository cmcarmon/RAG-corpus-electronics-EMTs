FIGURE 8.14 A Block with K Subsets of Instructions. Instructions
in each subset are shaded the same, one of which is sent to the WD
based on the alignment of the block on the instruction access pattern
of the processor. Each subset has a potentially different derived signa-
ture. All K derived signatures are stored in the WD as reference
information.
