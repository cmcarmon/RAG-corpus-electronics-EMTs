One of the most important results of classical algebra is that
polynomials with real coefﬁcients can be factored into real
linear factors and real quadratic factors. Any polynomial
R[l] has at most m roots (or zeros). If the same matrix is
considered over the ﬁeld of complex numbers C, then it has
exactly m roots. Nonreal complex roots must occur in complex
conjugate pairs. Note that there are essentially three problems
related to polynomials: evaluation, root ﬁnding, and curve
ﬁtting—and MATLAB functions polyval, roots, and polyﬁt
address all three.
