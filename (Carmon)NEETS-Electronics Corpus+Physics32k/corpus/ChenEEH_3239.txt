Voltage-regulating equipment is designed to maintain a
predetermined level of voltage automatically that would other-
wise vary with the load. As the load increases, the regulating
equipment boosts the voltage at the substation to compensate
for the increased voltage drop in the distribution feeder. In
cases where consumers are located at long distances from the
substation or where voltage along the primary circuit is exces-
sive, additional regulators or capacitors located at selected
points on the feeder provide supplementary regulation. Many
utilities have experienced that the most economical way of
regulating the voltage within the required limits is to apply
both step voltage regulators and shunt capacitors. Capacitors
are installed out on the feeders and on the substation bus in
