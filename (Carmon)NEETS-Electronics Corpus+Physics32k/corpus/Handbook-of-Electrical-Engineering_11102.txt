A report on a very limited (13 subjects) clinical trial [Ellis, 1987] of spinal nerve stimulation in para- and
quadriplegics employing pulsed electric current introduced by needle electrodes produced “encouraging results”
in terms of increased sensory perception and motor function. The signal obtained from a Chinese multipurpose
therapy apparatus was described as follows: “The pulsed-wave generator produced a biphasic wave form of 2
ms  duration  with  an  initial  slow  positive  deﬂection  followed  by  an  80-ms  rise  time  to  its  maximal  negative
deﬂection and subsequent asymptotic decay. This wave shape was pulsed in ramped bursts of 200 pulses per
