Deﬁnition 9 Signal Flow Graph
A signal ﬂow graph (SFG) (Kung, 1988) shown by G ¼ (V, L)
is a directed graph consisting of a set of vertices, (PEs) V and a
set of edges (links) L. Each variable v 2 V has its own set of
edges Lv such that an edge lv 2 Lv associated with r(ev) delay
elements of direction ev connect two PEs vi and vj, where
vi, vj 2 V. Based on shift-invariant DG, the resulting SFG
after space–time mapping is considered structurally time-in-
&
variant in which only edge structures remain invariant.
