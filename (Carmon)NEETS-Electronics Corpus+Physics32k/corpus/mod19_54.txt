A person who has stopped breathing is not necessarily dead, but is in immediate critical danger. Life 
depends on oxygen that is breathed into the lungs and then carried by the blood to every body cell. Since 
body cells cannot store oxygen, and since the blood can hold only a limited amount (and only for a short 
time), death will surely result from continued lack of breathing.
