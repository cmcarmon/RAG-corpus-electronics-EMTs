transformer is widely used in practice in conjunction with
impedance tuning stubs. For narrow band applications, a single
section is adequate. Otherwise, multiple cascaded sections are
required.
With reference to Figure 7.10(A), a quarter-wavelength
section (bl ¼ u ¼ p=2) of a lossless network with the input
impedance denoted by R gives the input impedance as follows
(from equation 7.2):
