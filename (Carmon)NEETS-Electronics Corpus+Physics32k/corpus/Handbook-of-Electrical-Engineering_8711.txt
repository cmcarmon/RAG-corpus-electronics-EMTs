This  deﬁnition  of  a  computer  language  does  not  separate  a  HLL  from  all  other  computer  languages.  To
understand the features of HLLs that make them different from other computer languages, we must understand
the  concepts  of  mechanical  translation  and  abstraction.  Furthermore,  to  understand  the  differences  among
HLLs, we must know how abstractions are used to change the computing paradigm. But ﬁrst, what is a HLL
in terms of translation and abstraction?
