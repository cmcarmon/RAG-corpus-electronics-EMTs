Conclusion
The use of neural networks for system identiﬁcation and control provides a means of adapting a controller on-
line in an effort to minimize a given cost index. The cost index includes typical measures associated with system
performance and can be modiﬁed without signiﬁcantly increasing the computational complexity of the adap-
tation process. For nonlinear systems, the identiﬁcation networks demonstrate the capacity to learn changes
in  the  plant  dynamics.  The  performance  of  the  neural  control  and  identiﬁcation  methodology  compares
favorably with many types of conventional approaches.
