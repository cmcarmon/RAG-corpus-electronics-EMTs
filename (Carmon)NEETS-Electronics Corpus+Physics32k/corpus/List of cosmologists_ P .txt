György Paál (1934-1992) in the late 1950s studied the quasar and galaxy cluster distributions, in 1970 from redshift quantization came up with the idea that the Universe might have nontrivial topological structure
Thanu Padmanabhan (1957–) studied quantum gravity and quantum cosmology
Leonard Parker established the study of quantum field theory within general relativity
P. James E. Peebles (1935–) predicted cosmic background radiation, contributed to structure theory, developed models that avoid dark matter
Roger Penrose (1931–) linked singularities to gravitational collapse, conjectured the nonexistence of naked singularities, and used gravitational entropy to explain homogeneity
Arno Penzias (1933–) was the first to observe the cosmic background radiation
Saul Perlmutter (1959–) used supernova observations to measure the expansion of the universe
Mark M. Phillips (1951–) used supernova observations to discover acceleration in the expansion of the universe, calibrated the supernova distance scale
Joel Primack (1945–) co-invented the theory of cold dark matter
Ptolemy (90–168) wrote the only surviving ancient text on astronomy, conjectured a model of the universe as a set of nested spheres with epicycles
