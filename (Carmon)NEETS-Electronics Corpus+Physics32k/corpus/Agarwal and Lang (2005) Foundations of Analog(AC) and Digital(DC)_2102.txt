This problem examines the very simple tuner for an AM radio
shown in Figure 14.71. Here, the tuner is the parallel inductor and capacitor. The
injection of radio signals into the tuner by the antenna is modeled by a current source,
while the Norton resistance of the antenna in parallel with the remainder of the radio
is modeled by a resistor. (You can learn more about antenna modeling in follow-on
courses in Electromagnetic Waves.) The AM radio band extends from 540 kHz through
1600 kHz. The information transmitted by each radio station is constrained to be within
±5 kHz of its center frequency. (You can learn more about AM radio transmission in
courses in signals and systems.) To prevent frequency overlap of neighboring stations,
the center frequency of each station is constrained to be a multiple of 10 kHz. Therefore,
the purpose of the tuner is to pass all frequencies within 5 kHz of the center frequency
of the selected station, while attenuating all other frequencies.
a) Assume that I(t) = I cos(ωt). Find v(t) where v(t) = V cos(ωt + φ), and both V and
φ are functions of ω. Note that v(t) is the output of the tuner, namely the signal that
is passed on to the remainder of the radio.
