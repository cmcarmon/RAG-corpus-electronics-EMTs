known  and  more  expensive 
  display  technology.  The  prime  feature  of  raster-
scan technology is that an area of the image may be made to appear to move on the screen by the application
of  simple  logical  operations.  Raster  graphics  displays  are,  therefore,  ideal  for  building  direct  manipulation
graphics applications such as block diagram editors, which will be discussed later. They are not so well suited
to the direct display and manipulation of vector images, which are a key part of many engineering graphics
applications. For example, it is difﬁcult to move part of a vector image such as a bode-plot without destroying
the rest of the picture or to display sloping lines that look smooth at low resolutions. However, the dominance
of  the  technology  has  been  a  factor  in  ensuring  that  the  deﬁciencies  in  the  technology  can  be  overcome  by
clever software.
