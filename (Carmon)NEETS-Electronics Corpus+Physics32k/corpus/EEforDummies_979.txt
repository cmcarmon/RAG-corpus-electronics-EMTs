Looking at a simple battery circuit
Figure 14-3 shows a simple DC circuit with 
a 1.5 V battery connected to a resistor 
labeled R1. The positive side of the battery 
(labeled +) is connected to the lead on 
one side of the resistor; the negative side 
of the battery is  connected to the lead on 
the other side of the resistor. With these 
connections made, current flows from the 
positive terminal of the battery through 
the resistor, and back to the negative 
 terminal of the battery.
