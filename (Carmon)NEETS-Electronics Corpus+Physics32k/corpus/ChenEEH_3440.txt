The overcurrent relaying of distribution feeders is a very reli-
able relaying principle as long as the time coordination can be
achieved for the selected levels of fault current as well as the
given circuit breaker operating times and instrument trans-
former ratios. The problems start occurring if the feeder
loading changes signiﬁcantly during a given period of time
and/or the level of fault currents are rather small. This may
affect a proper selection of settings that will accommodate a
wide-range ﬂuctuation in the load and fault currents. Some
other,
less likely, phenomena that may affect the relaying
performance are as follows: current transformer saturation,
selection of inadequate auxiliary transformer taps, and large
variation in the circuit breaker opening times.
