The time it takes for a reflection from a particular boundary to arrive at the geophone is called the travel time. If the seismic wave velocity in the rock is known, then the travel time may be used to estimate the depth to the reflector. For a simple vertically traveling wave, the travel time



t


{\displaystyle t}
from the surface to the reflector and back is called the Two-Way Time (TWT) and is given by the formula




t
=
2


d
V




{\displaystyle t=2{\frac {d}{V}}}
,
where



d


{\displaystyle d}
is the depth of the reflector and



V


{\displaystyle V}
is the wave velocity in the rock.
A series of apparently related reflections on several seismograms is often referred to as a reflection event. By correlating reflection events, a seismologist can create an estimated cross-section of the geologic structure that generated the reflections. Interpretation of large surveys is usually performed with programs using high-end three-dimensional computer graphics.
