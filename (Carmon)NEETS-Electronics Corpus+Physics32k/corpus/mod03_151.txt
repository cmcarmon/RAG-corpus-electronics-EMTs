In figure 1-30(A) the meter is in the 1000-volt range. The pointer is barely above the 0 position. It is
not possible to accurately read this voltage. In figure 1-30(B) the meter is switched to the 250 volt range.
From the pointer position it is possible to approximate the voltage as 20 volts. Since this is well below the
next range, the meter is switched, as in figure 1-30(C). With the meter in the 50-volt range, it is possible
to read the voltage as 22 volts. Since this is more than the next range of the meter (10 volts), the meter
would not be switched to the next (lower) scale.
