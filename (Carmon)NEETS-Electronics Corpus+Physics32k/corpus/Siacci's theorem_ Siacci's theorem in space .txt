Siacci’s theorem can be extended to three-dimensional motions. Thus, let C be a space curve traced out by P and s is the arc length of C corresponding to time t. Also, suppose that the binormal component of the angular momentum does not vanish. Then the acceleration vector of P can be expressed as

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =-{\frac {\kappa v^{2}r}{p}}\mathbf {e} _{r}+\left(v{\frac {dv}{ds}}+{\frac {\kappa v^{2}q}{p}}\right)\mathbf {e} _{t}.}

The tangential component is tangent to the curve C. The radial component is directed from the point P to the point where the perpendicular from an arbitrary fixed origin meets the osculating plane. Other expressions for a can be found in [1], where a new proof of Siacci's theorem is given.
