Other important characteristics of wave motion are reflection, refraction, diffraction, and the Doppler
effect. Big words, but the concept of each is easy to see. For ease of understanding, we will explain the
first two characteristics using light waves, and the last two characteristics using sound waves. You should
keep in mind that all waves react in a similar manner.
