The three-dimensional analysis of electromagnetic ﬁelds requires the use of numerical techniques exploiting
the best available computer systems. The well-found  laboratory  will  have  at  its  disposal  a  range  of  machines
that allow interactive data processing with access to software that provides geometric modeling tools and has
sufﬁcient central processing unit (CPU) power to solve the large (>10,000) set of algebraic equations involved,
see Section 44.4.
