As the voltage proceeds toward maximum at 90 degrees, its rate of change becomes less and less, 
hence the current must decrease toward zero. At 90 degrees the voltage across the capacitor is maximum, 
the capacitor is fully charged, and there is no further movement of electrons from plate to plate. That is 
why the current at 90 degrees is zero.
