Although the precise mechanics of how a MOSFET works is beyond the
scope of this discussion, the following provides some intuition on its operation.
First, recall that n
-type silicon conducts through the motion of its free elec-
trons. Let us consider the case where the gate and the source of the MOSFET
are connected to ground, as illustrated in Figure 6.35. In this situation, vGS = 0.

Because the n
doped source and drain are separated by a p-type layer, they
will not conduct any current when a voltage is applied across them (vDS > 0).
However, when a positive voltage is applied at the gate of the device
(vGS > 0), negative charges are attracted to the surface from the nearby negative-
charge-rich source region (as shown in Figure 6.36) and positive charges are
repelled from the surface. Of course, no current flows between the gate and
the substrate because of the insulating gate oxide layer. As the gate voltage
