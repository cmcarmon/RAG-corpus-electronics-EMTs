Ever	wonder	why	circuit	engineers	are	paid	highly	and	(depending	on	their	chosen
career	path)	are	presented	different	career	advancement	opportunities	(e.g.	work	as
computer	engineers,	robotics	specialists	jobs,	etc.)?
The	responsibilities	of	circuit	engineers	are	rather	demanding;	they	need	to	be
mentally	tough	and	be	open	to	different	challenges.	They	spend	hours	and	hours
racking	their	brains	out	to	determine	how	systems	can	be	made	more	efficient.
Chances	are,	there’s	always	a	way;	it’s	up	to	them	to	look	for	one.	When	a
particular	project	asks	for	it,	it’s	mandatory	for	them	to	let	their	creative	juices
flow	to	arrive	at	a	compatible	solution.	Otherwise,	their	built	circuits	may	stop
functioning	eventually.
As	mentioned,	it’s	practical	to	design	a	circuit	accordingly;	especially	with	their
employment	for	the	fields	of	communication,	navigation,	telecommunication,
travel,	and	other	industries,	their	designs	should	consider	a	particular	purpose.
Apart	from	the	objective	of	meeting	different	requirements,	there	needs	to	be	a
strategy	since	a	more	functional	circuit	comes	with	higher	quality;	it	can	make	a
project	consume	a	reduced	number	of	resources,	too.	
Reasons	why	there	are	various	circuit	designs:
