The light pen operates by sensing the existence or nonexistence of a pulse of light at the point on the screen
of the CRT or surface of any other light-emitting device where the point of the pen is placed. This is accomplished
by means of the circuit shown in Fig. 89.3(b), where the light pulse is collected and transmitted through the
Ô¨Åber optics to a light-sensitive device that converts the light pulse into an electrical pulse which is shaped by
some form of electronics (of which a Schmitt trigger is one example). We need not concern ourselves with the
exact form of the electronics except to note that this pulse is then sent to the computer, as shown in Fig. 89.4,
and provides a complete, closed-loop system. As the electronic pulse occurs at the time when the light pulse
passes under the light pen, the computer is informed of the location at which the designated operation is to
be performed and may proceed accordingly. Thus, the light pen is a pointing device that designates a point on
the display screen and can be used as an input device. Various light pen programs have been written to expand
the  capabilities  of  the  original  one,  and  it  should  be  noted  that  the  light  pen  is  coming  back  into  favor  as
improvements in accuracy, ease of operation, and reliability occur.
