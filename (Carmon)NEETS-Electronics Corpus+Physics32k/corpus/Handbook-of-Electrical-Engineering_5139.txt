In the event of such an applied voltage being alternating, the material specimen will experience vibrations.
Likewise, an applied vibration on the specimen would induce an alternating potential change between the two
faces.  The  most  commonly  known  materials  that  exhibit  piezoelectric  properties  are  natural  materials  like
quartz and a number of crystalline and polycrystalline compounds.
