Time-varying signals such as those in Figure 7.35 are characterized by their
peak-to-peak voltage and their DC offset. For example, the sinusoidal signal
vIN in Figure 7.35 has a peak-to-peak value of 0.2 V and a DC offset of 1.5 V.
Since the MOS amplifier is nonlinear, we define the output offset as the value
of vO when the DC input offset voltage is the only signal applied at the input.
Although the time-varying portion of the signal is of interest to us, as discussed
in Section 7.5.1, the DC offset is provided simply to keep the amplifier operating
in its saturation region.
