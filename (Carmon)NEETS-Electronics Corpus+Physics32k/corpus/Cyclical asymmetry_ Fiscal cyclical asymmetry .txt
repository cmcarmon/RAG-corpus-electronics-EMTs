Fiscal CA is based on national or international changes to fiscal policy as a result of cyclical intervention in money markets or currency exchanges. A simple example is the reaction of the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates when the dollar performs too well against other currencies such as the euro and the yen. Since currency exchanges are often predilated on the results of economic changes such as quarterly profit results, the Federal Reserve has to be cautious not to overreact or such fiscal changes will actually excacerbate the situation by making investment in America more attractive than equalizing exchange rates. When this does occur, it is a cyclical asymmetry.
