Designing transistor amplifier circuits is a field of study on its own, and 
many excellent books have been written on the subject. If you’re interested 
in learning more about transistors and how to design amplifier circuits 
using transistors, try getting your hands on a good electronics design book, 
such as The Art of Electronics, 3rd Edition by Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill 
(Cambridge University Press). It isn’t cheap, but it’s a classic.
