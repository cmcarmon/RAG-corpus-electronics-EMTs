Using an analogue multi-range meter 
 
Figure  14.8  shows 
the  controls  and  display 
provided  by  a  simple  analogue  multi-range  meter. 
The range selector allows you to select from a total 
of  twenty  ranges  and  six  measurement  functions. 
These functions are: 
 
(cid:127) DC voltage (DC, V) 
(cid:127) DC current (DC, mA) 
(cid:127) AC voltage (AC, V) 
(cid:127) Resistance (OHM) 
(cid:127) Continuity test (BUZZ) 
(cid:127) Battery check (BAT) 
 
Note  that  more  complex  instruments  may  have 
several more ranges.
