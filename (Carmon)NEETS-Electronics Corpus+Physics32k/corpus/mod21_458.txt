Intermodulation distortion cannot be entirely suppressed, but it can be minimized by shielding
components and circuitry, parasitic suppression circuitry, and antenna spacing. These factors are
incorporated in the design of the system and are tested during production. Any shields or parasitic
suppressors that are removed by the technician must be replaced before troubleshooting and/or repair can
be effective. Antenna locations also pose a consideration when installing a new system. Ship alteration
specifications must be observed when new antenna systems are being installed.
