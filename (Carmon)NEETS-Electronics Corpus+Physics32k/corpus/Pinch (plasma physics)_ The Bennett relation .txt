Consider a cylindrical column of fully ionized quasineutral plasma, with an axial electric field, producing an axial current density, j, and associated azimuthal magnetic field, B. As the current flows through its own magnetic field, a pinch is generated with an inward radial force density of j x B. In a steady state with forces balancing:
∇p = ∇(pe + pi) = j × Β
where ∇p is the magnetic pressure gradient, pe and pi is the electron and ion pressures. Then using Maxwell's equation ∇ × B = μ0 j and the ideal gas law p = N k T, we derive:

{\displaystyle 2Nk(T_{e}+T_{i})={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}I^{2}}
(the Bennett relation)
where N is the number of electrons per unit length along the axis, Te and Ti are the electron and ion temperatures, I is the total beam current, and k is the Boltzmann constant.
