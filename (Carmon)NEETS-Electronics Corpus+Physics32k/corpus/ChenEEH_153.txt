shown in Figure 4.3. Notice that in such a case we speak about
the input voltage across the left one-port, V1, and the output
voltage across the right one-port, V2. The plus sign is on top
and minus sign is at the bottom. We also indicate the currents
I1 and I2 as shown. Notice how the currents ï¬‚ow into the two-
port and how they leave it. It is very important to know these
directions.
