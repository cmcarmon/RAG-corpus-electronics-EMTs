This tells us that the magnitude of the capacitor voltage in a series RLC circuit
that is driven at its resonance frequency is Q times the input voltage! If, for
example, a series resonant circuit with a Q of 100 is connected to a 10-V
sinusoidal source, then at resonance the capacitor voltage will be 1000-V! Put
another way, even small excitations can cause massive responses in second-
order circuits when the excitation frequency is close to that of the circuit’s
resonance frequency. This now sheds some insight into the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge disaster. Because the frequency of alternating winds was close to the
bridge’s resonant frequency, the bridge began to sway back and forth and finally
collapsed. We will have a lot more to say about Q and the response of resonant
circuits in Section 14.6.
