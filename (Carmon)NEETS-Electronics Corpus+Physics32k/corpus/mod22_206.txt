Other groupings of keyswitches are used for special purposes, such as number entry (calculator) 
keypads, special function switches (F1-F12), and cursor control keys. The special function switches allow 
an operator to use the special functions designed in the software. For example, in a word processing 
program, you can use them to spell check a document, search for a particular portion of text, move text 
from one place to another, and to print hard copies of a document. These are but a few of the functions 
allowed; however, as you become more familiar with computers you will learn them all. The cursor 
control key allows you to move to different locations on the screen.
