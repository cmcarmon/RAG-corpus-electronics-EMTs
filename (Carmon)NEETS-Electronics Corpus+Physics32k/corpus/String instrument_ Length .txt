Pitch can be adjusted by varying the length of the string. A longer string results in a lower pitch, while a shorter string results in a higher pitch. The frequency is inversely proportional to the length:




f
‚àù


1
l




{\displaystyle f\propto {\frac {1}{l}}}

A string twice as long produces a tone of half the frequency (one octave lower).
