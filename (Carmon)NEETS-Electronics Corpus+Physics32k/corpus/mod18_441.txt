The effectiveness of your radar system depends largely upon the care and attention you give it. An 
improperly adjusted transmitter, for example, can reduce the accuracy of a perfectly aligned receiver; the 
entire system then becomes essentially useless. Maintenance, therefore, must encompass the entire system 
for best operation.
