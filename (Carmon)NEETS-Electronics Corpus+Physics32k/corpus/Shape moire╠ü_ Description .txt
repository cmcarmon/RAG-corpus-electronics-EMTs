Shape moiré is sometimes referred as band moiré. The opaque layer with transparent lines is called the revealing layer. The layer containing the periodically repeating shapes is called the base layer. The period of shapes in the base layer is denoted as pb. The period of transparent lines in the revealing layer is denoted as pr. The periods of both layers must be sufficiently close. The superimposition image reveals the shapes of the base layer stretched along the vertical axis. The magnified shapes appear periodically along the vertical axis. The dimensions along the horizontal axis are not changed. If the complex shape of the base layer is a sequence of symbols (e.g. a horizontal text) compressed along the vertical axis, then the superimposition of the revealing layer can restore the original proportions of these symbols. The size of optical shapes pm, magnified along the vertical axis is expressed by the following formula:

{\displaystyle p_{m}=-{\frac {p_{b}\cdot p_{r}}{p_{b}-p_{r}}}}

Negative values of pm signify mirrored appearance (the magnified shapes will be inverted along the vertical axis) of the stretched shapes.
When the revealing layer is moved along the vertical axis, the magnified shapes move along the vertical axis at a faster speed. The speedup factor is expressed by the following formula:

Negative values of vm / vr signify the movement of optical shapes in reverse direction.
