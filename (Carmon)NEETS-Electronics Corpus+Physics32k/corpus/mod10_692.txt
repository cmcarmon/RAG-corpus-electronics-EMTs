The DIRECTIVITY of an antenna or an array can be determined by looking at its radiation pattern. 
In an array propagating a given amount of energy, more radiation takes place in certain directions than in 
others. The elements in the array can be altered in such a way that they change the pattern and distribute it 
more uniformly in all directions. The elements can be considered as a group of antennas fed from a 
common source and facing different directions. On the other hand, the elements could be arranged so that 
the radiation would be focused in a single direction. With no increase in power from the transmitter, the 
amount of radiation in a given direction would be greater. Since the input power has no increase, this 
increased directivity is achieved at the expense of gain in other directions.
