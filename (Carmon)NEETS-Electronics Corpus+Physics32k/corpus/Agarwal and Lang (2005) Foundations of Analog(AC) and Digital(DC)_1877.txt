If desired, the expressions for the actual voltages and currents, the par-
ticular solutions or forced responses in Chapter 10 parlance, can be found by
multiplying the corresponding complex variable by e jÏ‰t and taking the real part.
For example, to obtain the actual voltage vx(t) from the corresponding
