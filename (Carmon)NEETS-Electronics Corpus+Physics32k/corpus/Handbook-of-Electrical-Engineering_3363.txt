where Vp  is  the  voltage  required  to  turn  the  modulator  from  on  to  off,  and f  is  any  static  phase  imbalance
between  the  interferometer  arms.  This  transfer  function  is  shown  graphically  in  Fig. 31.21.  Note  that  the
modulator shown in Fig. 31.21 has push-pull electrodes. This means that when a voltage is applied, the refractive
index is changed in opposite directions in the two arms, yielding a twice-as-efÔ¨Åcient modulation.
