The velocity of a particle is a vector quantity that describes the direction of motion and the magnitude of the motion of particle. More mathematically, the rate of change of the position vector of a point, with respect to time is the velocity of the point. Consider the ratio of the difference of two positions of a particle divided by the time interval, which is called the average velocity over that time interval. This average velocity is defined as

,


{\displaystyle {\overline {\mathbf {V} }}={\frac {\Delta \mathbf {P} }{\Delta t}}\ ,}

where ΔP is the change in the position vector over the time interval Δt.
In the limit as the time interval Δt becomes smaller and smaller, the average velocity becomes the time derivative of the position vector,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} =\lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\Delta \mathbf {P} }{\Delta t}}={\frac {d\mathbf {P} }{dt}}={\dot {\mathbf {P} }}={\dot {x}}_{p}{\hat {\imath }}+{\dot {y}}_{P}{\hat {\jmath }}+{\dot {z}}_{P}{\hat {k}}.}

Thus, velocity is the time rate of change of position of a point, and the dot denotes the derivative of those functions x, y, and z with respect to time. Furthermore, the velocity is tangent to the trajectory of the particle at every position the particle occupies along its path. Note that in a non-rotating frame of reference, the derivatives of the coordinate directions are not considered as their directions and magnitudes are constants.
The speed of an object is the magnitude |V| of its velocity. It is a scalar quantity:

{\displaystyle |\mathbf {V} |=|{\dot {\mathbf {P} }}|={\frac {ds}{dt}},}

where s is the arc-length measured along the trajectory of the particle. This arc-length traveled by a particle over time is a non-decreasing quantity. Hence, ds/dt is non-negative, which implies that speed is also non-negative.
