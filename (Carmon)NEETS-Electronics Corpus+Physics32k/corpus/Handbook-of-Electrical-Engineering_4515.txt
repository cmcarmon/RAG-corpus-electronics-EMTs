Integral Equation Model
The  basic  starting  point  for  developing  an  IE  model  in  electromagnetics  is  selection  of  a  Green’s  function
appropriate  for  the  problem  class  of  interest.  While  there  are  a  variety  of  Green’s  functions  from  which  to
choose,  a  typical  starting  point  for  most  IE  MoM  models  is  that  for  an  inﬁnite  medium.  One  of  the  more
straightforward is based on the scalar Green’s function and Green’s theorem. This leads to the Kirchhoff integrals

terms of integrals over the surfaces that bound it and volume integrals over those sources located within it.
