NASA continues development of the Orion spacecraft for deep space travel. In an effort to reduce costs, it has contracted for private development of vehicles for use in low Earth orbit. The Commercial Crew Development program seeks one or more vehicles to bring people to and from the International Space Station, and for the launch vehicle involves human-rating the United States Air Force's Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles. Private spacecraft are already operating under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program bringing cargo to ISS.
