The last component is the transfer time, i.e., the time to physically transfer the bytes from disk to the host.
While  the  transfer  time  is  a  strong  function  of  the  number  of  bytes  to  be  transferred,  seek  and  rotational
latencies  times  are  independent  of  the  transfer  blocksize.  If  data  is  to  be  read  or  written  in  large  chunks,  it
makes sense to choose a large blocksize, since the “ﬁxed cost” of seek and latency is better amortized across a
large data transfer.
