It has been emphasized that the exact functional form used
to estimate the capacitance and the delay is not important. The
only requirement that the delay model must satisfy is that an
increase or decrease in the coupling capacitance should be
translated into an increase or reduction in the delay of a net
(Sapatnekar, 2000).
