is often called the relativistic mass of the object in the given frame of reference.
This makes the relativistic relation between the spatial velocity and the spatial momentum look identical. However, this can be misleading, as it is not appropriate in special relativity in all circumstances. For instance, kinetic energy and force in special relativity can not be written exactly like their classical analogues by only replacing the mass with the relativistic mass. Moreover, under Lorentz transformations, this relativistic mass is not invariant, while the rest mass is. For this reason many people find it easier use the rest mass (thereby introduce γ through the 4-velocity or coordinate time), and discard the concept of relativistic mass.
Lev B. Okun suggested that "this terminology ... has no rational justification today", and should no longer be taught.
Other physicists, including Wolfgang Rindler and T. R. Sandin, have argued that relativistic mass is a useful concept and there is little reason to stop using it. See mass in special relativity for more information on this debate.
Some authors use m for relativistic mass and m0 for rest mass, others simply use m for rest mass. This article uses the former convention for clarity.
The energy and momentum of an object with invariant mass m0 are related by the formulas

The first is referred to as the relativistic energy–momentum relation. It can be derived by considering that

where the denominator can be written as

. Now, gamma can be replaced in the expression of energy. While the energy E and the momentum p depend on the frame of reference in which they are measured, the quantity E2 − (pc)2 is invariant, and arises as −c2 times the squared magnitude of the 4-momentum vector which is −(m0c)2.
It should be noted that the invariant mass of a system

is different from the sum of the rest masses of the particles of which it is composed due to kinetic energy and binding energy. Rest mass is not a conserved quantity in special relativity unlike the situation in Newtonian physics. However, even if an object is changing internally, so long as it does not exchange energy with surroundings, then its rest mass will not change, and can be calculated with the same result in any frame of reference.
A particle whose rest mass is zero is called massless. Photons and gravitons are thought to be massless; and neutrinos are nearly so.
