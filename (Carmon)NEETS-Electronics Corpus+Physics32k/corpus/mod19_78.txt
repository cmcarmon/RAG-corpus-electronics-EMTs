Capillary blood is usually brick red in color. If capillaries are cut, the blood oozes out slowly. Blood 
from veins is dark red. If a vein is cut, the blood escapes in a steady, even flow. If an artery near the 
surface is cut, the blood will gush out in spurts that are synchronized with the heartbeats; but if the cut 
artery is deeply buried, the bleeding will appear to be a steady stream. Arterial blood is usually bright red 
in color.
