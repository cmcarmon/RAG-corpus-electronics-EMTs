A shorted capacitor or an open filter resistor results in a no-output indication. An open filter resistor 
results in an abnormally high dc voltage at the input to the filter and no voltage at the output of the filter. 
Leaky capacitors or filter resistors that have lost their effectiveness, or filter resistors that have decreased 
in value, result in an excessive ripple amplitude in the output of the supply.
