Fully Formed Character Printing. Various line printer technologies have evolved over the past but the most
popular extant technology makes use of a band of etched engraved characters (plus timing and position marks)
in  a  continuously  moving  loop  conﬁguration  (see  Fig. 89.33).  This  band  is  positioned  between  a  page-wide
bank  (typically  132)  of  hammers-actuators  and  the  paper/ribbon  set.  With  timing  and  position  marks,  the
location of the characters (replicated several times on the band loop) can be easily tracked and the appropriate
hammers  can  be  asynchronously  ﬁred  to  provide  a  full  line  of  print  in  tens  of  milliseconds.  A  limit  to  the
throughput Pr (lines per minute [lpm]) of such a printer may be approximated by:
