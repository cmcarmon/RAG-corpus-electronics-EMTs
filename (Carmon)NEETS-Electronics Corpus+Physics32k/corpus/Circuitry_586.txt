Maxwell 
existence  of 
electromagnetic  waves  in  1864.  Later,  Heinrich 
Rudolf  Hertz  used  an  arrangement  of  rudimentary 
resonators 
the  existence  of 
electromagnetic  waves.  Hertz’s  apparatus  was 
extremely  simple  and  comprised  two  resonant 
loops,  one  for  transmitting  and  the  other  for 
receiving.  Each  loop  acted  both  as  a  tuned  circuit 
and as a resonant aerial. The transmitting loop was 
excited by means of an induction coil and battery. 
Some  of  the  energy  radiated  by  the  transmitting 
loop was intercepted by the receiving loop and the 
received energy was conveyed to a spark gap where 
it could be released as an arc. The energy radiated 
by  the  transmitting  loop  was  in  the  form  of  an 
electromagnetic  wave—a wave  that  has  both 
electric  and  magnetic  field  components  and  that 
travels at the speed of light. 
  In 1894, Marconi demonstrated the commercial 
potential  of 
that  Maxwell 
predicted and Hertz actually used in his apparatus. 
It  was  also  Marconi  that  made  radio  a  reality  by 
pioneering  the  development  of  telegraphy  without 
wires 
to 
demonstrate very effectively that information could 
be exchanged between distant locations without the 
need for a ‘land-line’. 
  Marconi’s  system  of  wireless 
telegraphy 
proved 
for  maritime 
communications  (ship  to  ship  and  ship  to  shore) 
and  was  to  be  instrumental  in  saving  many  lives. 
The  military  applications  of  radio  were  first 
exploited  during  the  First  World  War  (1914  to 
1918) and, during that period, radio was first used 
in aircraft.
