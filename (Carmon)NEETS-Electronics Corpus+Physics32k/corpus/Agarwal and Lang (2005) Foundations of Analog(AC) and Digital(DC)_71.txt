Building upon the set of abstractions that define the transition from physics
to electrical engineering, electrical engineering creates further abstractions to
manage the complexity of building large systems. A lumped circuit element
is often used as an abstract representation or a model of a piece of mate-
rial with complicated internal behavior. Similarly, a circuit often serves as an
abstract representation of interrelated physical phenomena. The operational
amplifier composed of primitive discrete elements is a powerful abstraction
that simplifies the building of bigger analog systems. The logic gate, the digital
memory, the digital finite-state machine, and the microprocessor are themselves
a succession of abstractions developed to facilitate building complex computer
and control systems. Similarly, the art of computer programming involves
the mastery of creating successively higher-level abstractions from lower-level
primitives.
