A short input (in control systems terminology an impulse) in pitch (generally via the elevator in a standard configuration fixed-wing aircraft) will generally lead to overshoots about the trimmed condition. The transition is characterized by a damped simple harmonic motion about the new trim. There is very little change in the trajectory over the time it takes for the oscillation to damp out.
Generally this oscillation is high frequency (hence short period) and is damped over a period of a few seconds. A real-world example would involve a pilot selecting a new climb attitude, for example 5° nose up from the original attitude. A short, sharp pull back on the control column may be used, and will generally lead to oscillations about the new trim condition. If the oscillations are poorly damped the aircraft will take a long period of time to settle at the new condition, potentially leading to Pilot-induced oscillation. If the short period mode is unstable it will generally be impossible for the pilot to safely control the aircraft for any period of time.
This damped harmonic motion is called the short period pitch oscillation, it arises from the tendency of a stable aircraft to point in the general direction of flight. It is very similar in nature to the weathercock mode of missile or rocket configurations. The motion involves mainly the pitch attitude

But the forces are generated by the pressure distribution on the body, and are referred to the velocity vector. But the velocity (wind) axes set is not an inertial frame so we must resolve the fixed axes forces into wind axes. Also, we are only concerned with the force along the z-axis:

We are only concerned with perturbations in forces and moments, due to perturbations in the states

and q, and their time derivatives. These are characterized by stability derivatives determined from the flight condition. The possible stability derivatives are:





Z

{\displaystyle Z_{\alpha }}
Lift due to incidence, this is negative because the z-axis is downwards whilst positive incidence causes an upwards force.





Z

q




{\displaystyle Z_{q}}
Lift due to pitch rate, arises from the increase in tail incidence, hence is also negative, but small compared with

M

{\displaystyle M_{\alpha }}
Pitching moment due to incidence - the static stability term. Static stability requires this to be negative.





M

{\displaystyle M_{q}}
Pitching moment due to pitch rate - the pitch damping term, this is always negative.

Since the tail is operating in the flowfield of the wing, changes in the wing incidence cause changes in the downwash, but there is a delay for the change in wing flowfield to affect the tail lift, this is represented as a moment proportional to the rate of change of incidence:





M

{\displaystyle M_{\dot {\alpha }}}


The delayed downwash effect gives the tail more lift and produces a nose down moment, so

, which defines the longitudinal static stability of the aircraft, it must be negative for stability. The damping term is reduced by the downwash effect, and it is difficult to design an aircraft with both rapid natural response and heavy damping. Usually, the response is underdamped but stable.
