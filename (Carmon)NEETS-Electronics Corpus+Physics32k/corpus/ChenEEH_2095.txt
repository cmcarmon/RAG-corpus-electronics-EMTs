nondeterministically. The ﬁring of an elementary transition is
atomic, and the ﬁring of a super transition implies the ﬁring of
some elementary transition and may not be atomic. We deﬁne
the behavior of an HPrTN to be the set of all possible maximal
execution sequences containing only elementary transitions.
Each execution sequence represents consecutively reachable
markings from the initial marking in which a successor
marking is obtained through a step (ﬁring of some enabled
transitions) from the predecessor marking.
