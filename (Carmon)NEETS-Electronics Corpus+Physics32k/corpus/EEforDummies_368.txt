When you’re thirsty for water, you can generally get a drink in two ways: by 
catching water that originated from a source and flows out of pipes when you 
turn on the tap, or by getting water from a storage container, such as a water 
cooler. You can think about electrical energy in a similar vein: You can get 
electrical energy directly from a source (such as a battery or a generator), or 
you can get it from a device that stores electrical energy — a capacitor.
