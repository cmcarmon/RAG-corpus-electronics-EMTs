The ﬁrst term in equation 4.58 corresponds to the incident
wave, and the second corresponds to the reﬂected wave. The

For a matched load, GL ¼ 0 (ZL ¼ Z0); therefore, the power
transferred to the load is just the ﬁrst term in equation 4.58.
This is not the maximum power transfer, however, for there is
still a mismatch at the generator-end of the line because
Zg 6¼ Zin ¼ Z0 (Gg 6¼ 0). The maximum power transfer on a
lossless line occurs for a conjugate match at the generator-end,
Zin ¼ Z
