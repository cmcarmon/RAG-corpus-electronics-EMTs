If you have studied transformers, you may have learned that when voltage is stepped up, the output 
current decreases. This is also true of voltage multipliers. Although the measured output voltage of a 
voltage multiplier may be several times greater than the input voltage, once a load is connected the value 
of the output voltage decreases. Also any small fluctuation of load impedance causes a large fluctuation in 
the output voltage of the multiplier. For this reason, voltage multipliers are used only in special 
applications where the load is constant and has a high impedance or where input voltage stability is not 
critical.
