8See if you can ﬁnd this representation.
9Note that there will always be numbers that have an inﬁnite representation in any chosen positional system. The choice
of base deﬁnes which do and which don’t. If you were thinking that base-10 numbers would solve this inaccuracy, note that
1/3 = 0.333333.... has an inﬁnite representation in decimal (and binary for that matter), but has ﬁnite representation in base-3.
10A carry means that a computation performed at a given position aﬀects other positions as well. Here, 1 + 1 = 10 is an
