The long range of gravity and the slow "relaxation" of stellar systems prevent the use of the (conventional) methods of statistical physics, as stellar dynamical orbits tend to be much more irregular and chaotic than celestial mechanical orbits.
The "relaxation" of stars is the process deflecting the individual trajectories of stars from the one they would have if the distribution of matter was perfectly smooth. The "2-body relaxation" is induced by the individual star-star interactions, while the "violent relaxation" is induced by a large collective variation of the stellar system shape.
There is a mathematical undercurrent to stellar dynamics; the key physical theories, classical analytical mechanics, Newtonian gravity and (statistical) thermodynamics on the one hand are closely related to the mathematical branches of dynamical systems and ergodic theory (itself having major connections to DS theory) respectively. The possibility of gravitational interactions and collisions also lead to a treatment of mathematical scattering theory. As such a number of stellar dynamicists are also mathematicians by training.
