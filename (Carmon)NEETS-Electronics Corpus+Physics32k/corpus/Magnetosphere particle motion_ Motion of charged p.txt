The simplest magnetic field B is a constant one– straight parallel field lines and constant field intensity. In such a field, if an ion or electron enters perpendicular to the field lines, it can be shown to move in a circle (the field only needs to be constant in the region covering the circle). If q is the charge of the particle, m its mass, v its velocity and Rg the radius of the circle ("gyration radius"), all one needs do is notice that the centripetal force mv2/Rg must equal the magnetic force qvB. One gets

Rg = mv/(qB)

If the initial velocity of the particle has a different direction, one only needs resolve it into a component v⊥perpendicular to B and a component v// parallel to B, and replace v in the above formula with v⊥.
If W⊥=m v⊥2/2 is the energy associated with the perpendicular motion in electron-volts (all calculations here are non-relativistic), in a field of B nT (nanotesla), then Rg in kilometers is

For protons         Rg = (144/B) √W⊥
For electrons         Rg = (3.37/B) √W⊥

The velocity parallel to the field v// is not affected by the field, because no magnetic force exists in that direction. That velocity just stays constant (as long as the field does), and adding the two motions together gives a spiral around a central guiding field line. If the field curves or changes, the motion is modified, but the general character of spiraling around a central field line persists: hence the name "guiding center motion."
Because the magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity, it performs no work and requires no energy—nor does it provide any. Thus magnetic fields (like the Earth's) can profoundly affect particle motion in them, but need no energy input to maintain their effect. Particles may also get steered around, but their total energy remains the same.
