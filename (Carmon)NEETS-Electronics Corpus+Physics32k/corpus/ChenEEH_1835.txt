Another approach is MBone or Multicast Backbone. Mbone
is essentially a virtual network implemented on top of some
portions of the Internet. In the MBone, islands of multicast-
capable networks are connected to each other by virtual links
called tunnels. Multicast messages are forwarded through
these tunnels in non multicast-capable portions of the Inter-
net. For forwarding multicast packets through these tunnels,
they are encapsulated as IP-over-IP (with protocol number set
to four) such that they look like normal unicast packets to
interventing routers.
