To illustrate this new approach, let us analyze the simple linear first-order RC
circuit shown in Figure 13.3, and presume that we wish to find the capacitor
voltage vc, in response to a cosine wave suddenly applied at t = 0, often called
a tone burst. The tone burst is mathematically represented as
