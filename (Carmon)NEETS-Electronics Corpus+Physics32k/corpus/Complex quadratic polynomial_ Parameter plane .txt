The phase space of a quadratic map is called its parameter plane. Here:





z

0


=

z

c
r





{\displaystyle z_{0}=z_{cr}\,}
is constant and



c



{\displaystyle c\,}
is variable.
There is no dynamics here. It is only a set of parameter values. There are no orbits on the parameter plane.
The parameter plane consists of:
The Mandelbrot set
The bifurcation locus = boundary of Mandelbrot set with
root points

Bounded hyperbolic components of the Mandelbrot set = interior of Mandelbrot set with internal rays

exterior of Mandelbrot set with
external rays
equipotential lines

There are many different subtypes of the parameter plane.
