It has been well recognized that renewable energy sources would have to play a key role in
solving the world energy problem. Wind energy with an estimated potential of 130 million MW
far exceeds the worldâ€™s hydraulic supply of about 3 million MW. Consequently, researchers have
been looking into the economic utilization of wind energy on a large scale by developing cost-
competitive and reliable wind-energy-conversion systems (WECSs) for various applications such
as electricity generation, agriculture, heating, and cooling.
