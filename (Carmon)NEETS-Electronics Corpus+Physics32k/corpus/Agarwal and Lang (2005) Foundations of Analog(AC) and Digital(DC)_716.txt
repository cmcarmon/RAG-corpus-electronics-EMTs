The tighter bounds on the voltage values for a sender compared to those
for a receiver result in an asymmetry in input and output voltage thresholds.
This asymmetry is reflected in Figure 5.8, which shows the correspondence
between valid voltage levels and logic signals that is in common use in digital
circuits.
