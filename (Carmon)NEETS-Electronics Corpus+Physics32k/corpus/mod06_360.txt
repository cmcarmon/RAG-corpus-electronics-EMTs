All CRTâ€™s have three main elements: an electron gun, a deflection system, and a screen. The electron
gun provides an electron beam, which is a highly concentrated stream of electrons. The deflection system
positions the electron beam on the screen, and the screen displays a small spot of light at the point where
the electron beam strikes it.
