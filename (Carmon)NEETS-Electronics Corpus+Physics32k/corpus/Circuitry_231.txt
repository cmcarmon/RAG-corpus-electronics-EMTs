the  valence  shells  overlap  from  one  atom  to 
another.  This  causes  each 
individual  valence 
electron  to  be  shared  by  two  atoms,  as  shown  in 
Fig.  5.1.  By  sharing  the  electrons  between  four 
adjacent  atoms  each 
individual  silicon  atom 
appears to have eight electrons in its valence shell. 
This sharing of valence electrons is called covalent 
bonding.
