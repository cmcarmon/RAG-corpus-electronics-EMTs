Using MATLAB, plot the bandstop response.
3.6.7 An expression for a sawtooth wave over the in-
ternal 0 ≤ t ≤ T0 is given by f (t ) = At /T0.
The student is encouraged to check the Fourier
coefﬁcients to be a0 = A/2, an = 0 for all n, and
bn = −A/(nπ ) for all n. The Fourier series for
the sawtooth wave is then given by
