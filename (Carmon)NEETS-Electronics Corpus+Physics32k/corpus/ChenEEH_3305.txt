The line losses associated with any transmission line in turn
depend on the line resistance and the line current magnitude.
As stated earlier, one of the main objectives of power ﬂow
studies is to compute the line currents, and as such, the line
current values are not known at the beginning of a power ﬂow
computation. Therefore, we do not know the actual values for
the line losses in the transmission network. Looking at equa-
tion 7.45, we need to assume that at least of one of the
variables PGi or PLi should be a free variable for satisfying the
real power conservation. Traditionally, we assume that one of
the generations is a ‘‘slack’’ variable, and such a generator bus
is denoted the slack bus. At the slack bus, we specify both
the voltage Vi and the angle di. The power injections Pi and Qi
are the unknown variables. Again, by tradition, we set the
voltage at slack bus to be the rated voltage or at 1 pu and
the phase angle to be at zero.
Like in standard textbooks, slack bus is deﬁned in this
section to be the ﬁrst bus in the network with V1 ¼ 1 and
the angle d1 ¼ 0. Assuming the number of generators to be
NG, the busses 2 through NG þ 1 are set to be the PV busses.
The remaining buses NG þ 2 through N are then the PQ
busses.
