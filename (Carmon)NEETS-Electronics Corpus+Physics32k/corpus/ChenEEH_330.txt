Figure 3.11 shows typical subthreshold characteristics of a
MOSFET. As predicted by the above model, log IDS increases
linearly with gate bias up to VT . In strong inversion, the
subthreshold model is no longer valid, and either equation
20 or 23 must be used depending on the drain bias. When
VGS Â¼ VT ,
log IDS deviates from linearity. In practice, this is
a commonly used method to measure the threshold voltage.
In terms of device parameters, subthreshold swing can be
expressed as:
