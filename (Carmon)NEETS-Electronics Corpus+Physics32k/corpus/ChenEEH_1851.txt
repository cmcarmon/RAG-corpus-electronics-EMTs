H.323 is part of a family of ITU-T recommendations illus-
trated in Table 7.6. The family is called H.32x and provides
multimedia communication services over a wide variety of
networks. Interoperation between these different standards
is obtained through a Gateway that provides data format
translation as well as controls signaling translation, audio
and video codec translation, and call
setup/termination
functionality.
