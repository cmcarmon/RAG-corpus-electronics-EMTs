tools include System Build from Integrated Systems Incorporated, ModelC from Systems Control Technology,
the  PC-Based  XAnalog  from  Xanalog,  Simulab/Simulink  from  the  Mathworks,  and  BEACON  from  General
Electric. Some of these tools primarily serve as interfaces to analysis packages such as MATRIXx (System-Build),
CTRL-C  (Model-C),  and  MATLAB  (Simulink).  In  some  cases  they  can  also  be  used  to  directly  generate  a
computer language such as FORTRAN, ADA, or C. A summary of an early 1989 evaluation of the suitability
of using System Build, CTRL-C, and Grummanâ€™s Protoblock for engine control is given in [Spang et al., 1993].
