where  h  is  the  Planck  constant  (6.624 3  10–34  J  s–1),  k  the  Boltzmann  constant  (1.38 3  10–23  J  K–1),  DH  the
activation energy of the relaxation process, R the universal gas constant (8.314 3 103 J K–1 kmol–1), and DS the
entropy of activation. For the ionic relaxation process, t may alternatively be taken as equal to 1/2G, where G
denotes the ion jump probability between two equilibrium positions. Also for dipole orientation in liquids, t
may be approximately equated to the Debye term  h/4pr 3T, where h represents the macroscopic viscosity of
the liquid and r is the dipole radius [Bartnikas, 1994]. With interfacial or space charge polarization, which may
arise  due  to  a  pile-up  of  charges  at  the  interface  of  two  contiguous  dielectrics  of  different  conductivity  and
permittivity, Eq. (55.10) must be rewritten as [von Hippel, 1956]
