Perhaps  the  most  notable  OS  standard  is  POSIX,  standard  number  1003  [IEEE,  1990],  sponsored  by  the
IEEE Computer Societyâ€™s Technical Committee on Operating Systems. POSIX is a family of standards based
on the UNIX operating system that includes the system call interface, user-level commands, real-time extensions,
and  networking  extensions.  The  POSIX  system  call  interface,  1003.1,  was  adopted  by  the  U.S.  government
verbatim as a Federal Information Processing Standard, FIPS 151. Many vendors conform to POSIX; thus, a
program that conforms to this standard can be ported to many system platforms without change.
