Spherical robots are typically heavy-duty robots. They have the advan-
tages of high speed due to the rotary base, and a large work volume, but
are more kinematically complex than either Cartesian or cylindrical robots.
Generally, they are used for heavy-duty tasks in, for example, automobile
manufacturing. They do not have the dexterity to reach around obstacles
in  the  workspace.  Spherical  robots  also  do  not  have  Ô¨Åxed  resolution
throughout the workspace.
