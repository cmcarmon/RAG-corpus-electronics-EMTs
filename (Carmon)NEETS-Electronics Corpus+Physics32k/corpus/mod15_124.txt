Now, with the TX in the same position (75º), the TDX rotor is turned to 30º  (view B). The angle 
between the TDX stator field and R2 is then increased by 30º. This appears to the TR as an additional 
rotation of the TDX stator field. In transmitting the TX signal to the TR, the TDX adds the amount its 
own rotor has turned. The TR rotor now turns to 105º. Thus, the equation 75º  + 30º  = 105º is solved.
