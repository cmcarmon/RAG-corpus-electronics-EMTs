In a general sense, the Second Law says that temperature differences between systems in contact with each other tend to even out and that work can be obtained from these non-equilibrium differences, but that loss of heat occurs in the form of entropy when work is done. This law follows simply from statistics: if a physical system is given (is allowed to occupy) new energy states which are equivalent to the existing states (say, a gas is expanding into a larger volume), then the system will occupy "new" states on equal footing with the existing ("old") ones. This is the central postulate of statistical mechanics - that equivalent energy states cannot be distinguished (at equilibrium). Thus, as the number of energy states increases, the energy of the system will be spread among more and more states, thereby increasing the entropy of the system.
The Second Law can be summarized by either of the following sayings:
"The entropy of any closed thermodynamic system cannot decrease."
"The entropy of the universe cannot decrease."
Some wags have proposed the following summary of the First and Second Laws: "The first law says you can't win, the second law says you can't even break even."
There are various interpretations of the Second Law, one being Boltzmann's H-theorem.
