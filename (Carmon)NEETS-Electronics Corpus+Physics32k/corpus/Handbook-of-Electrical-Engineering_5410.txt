The  PV  cell  array  for  TPV  systems  are  likely  to  represent  about  half  of  the  system  cost  for  units  using
crystalline silicon or III–V devices. How might the applications for TPV systems change if thin-ﬁlm photovol-
taics or other advances signiﬁcantly drop projected system costs? One possibility may be in co-generation in
industrial processes. For example, ﬂoat-glass manufacturing processes 600 tons of material each day for a typical
line.  These  factories  melt  feedstock  in  crucibles  100 ft  long  by  30 ft  wide  operating  at  1500°C.  Projected
technology advances both in improving energy efﬁciency of glass manufacturing as well as in TPV create the
potential for covering the top of this melt unit with an umbrella of TPV converters. A large part of the electric
demand for the factory might be met by the co-generation unit. The engineering problems may be challenging,
however, even if the beneﬁts are potentially great.
