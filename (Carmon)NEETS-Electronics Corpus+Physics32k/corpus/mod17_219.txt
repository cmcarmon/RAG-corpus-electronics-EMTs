The need for frequency stability in ssb operations is extremely critical. Even a small deviation from
the correct value in local oscillator frequency will cause the IF produced by the mixer to be displaced
from its correct value. In AM reception this is not too damaging, since the carrier and sidebands are all
present and will all be displaced an equal amount. Therefore, the relative positions of carrier and
sidebands will be retained. However, in ssb reception there is no carrier, and only one sideband is present
in the incoming signal.
