Parallel or ﬂash A/D conversion is used in high-speed applications such as video signal processing, medical
imaging, and radar detection systems. A ﬂash A/D converter simultaneously compares the input analog voltage
n
-bit digital code representing the analog voltage. Typical ﬂash A/D
to 2
n
converters with 8-bit resolution operate at 20 to 100 MHz.
