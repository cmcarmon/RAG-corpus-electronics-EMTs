A motion and amendment electoral system decides the result of the election by following standard rules for adopting other proposals. The steps are:
A substantive motion is proposed that "individual A is elected".
Proposals for amendments are invited. If none are received then move to step 4.
If an amendment is proposed that the motion be changed by deleting "A" and inserting "B" then that is voted on. If the amendment is carried then the substantive motion becomes "individual B is elected". In either case the process returns to step 2.
With no more proposed amendments, the substantive motion is put to the vote. If it is carried then the election is complete. If not then the process returns to step 1, or stops without a result.
This was the system used for the election of the Speaker of the British House of Commons until 2001.
If there is a Condorcet winner and people vote according to their preferences, then that individual will be considered in the final vote on the motion in step 4. If there is not a Condorcet winner then any person in the final motion will be a member of the Smith set; which individual that is may depend on who is nominated at which stage. However, there is no guarantee that a motion will pass at the end.
