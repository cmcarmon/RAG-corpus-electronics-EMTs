An election by list is an electoral system of political representatives by which the electors of an area vote for lists of candidates. If the system is an election by majority (absolute or relative), the list that win get all or a part of the representatives for that area. If the system is an election by list by proportionality, the seats allocated to that area are split between winning lists, depending of their results, and a prime can be given to the first list. The system can be with one or two rounds.
Such system of election exist in France, Tunisia, or Ecuador, as examples.
