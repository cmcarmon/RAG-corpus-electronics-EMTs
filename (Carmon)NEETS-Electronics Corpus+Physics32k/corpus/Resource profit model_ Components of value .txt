Value is determined by costs, quality and timeliness. An organization needs to provide at least two of these components to provide value to customers. An organization that offers high quality for low costs can be successful even if the delivery time of its products or services is not timely. Also the combination of low costs and timeliness can meet the requirements of some customers, even though the quality is not meeting the standard of competitors. In the premium sector, quality and timeliness are the most important criteria. Higher costs will be accepted in order to have these benefits.
In the end, value is what the customer perceives as valuable. Therefore, an organization needs to know what their customers are looking for.
