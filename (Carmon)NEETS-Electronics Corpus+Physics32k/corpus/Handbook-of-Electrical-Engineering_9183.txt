To penetrate new markets, the smart card industry must now develop value-added solutions by enhancing
the  functionality  of  the  conventional  card.  To  be  attractive  to  customers,  the  same  card  should  be  used  for
access control, securing transactions on the net, and for payment. This trend implies the coexistence of multiple
applications  on  the  same  card.  It  also  means  the  customization  of  the  user  card.  The  Java  Card  and,  more
recently, the Smart Card for Windows are supporting this stream where developers can download their own
application into the card.
