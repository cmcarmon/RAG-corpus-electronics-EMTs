Approximations are known to generate digital ﬁlter coefﬁ-
cients with high accuracy. After coefﬁcient quantization, the
frequency response of the realized digital ﬁlter will deviate
from the ideal response and eventually fail to meet the pre-
scribed speciﬁcations. Because the sensitivity of the ﬁlter re-
sponse to coefﬁcient quantization varies with the structure,
the development of low-sensitivity digital ﬁlter realizations
has raised signiﬁcant interest (Antoniou, 1993; Diniz et al.,
2002).
