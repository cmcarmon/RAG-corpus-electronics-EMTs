HSX has made and continues to make fundamental contributions to the physics of quasisymmetric stellarators that show significant improvement over the conventional stellarator concept. These include:
Measuring large ion flows in the direction of quasisymmetry
Reduced flow damping in the direction of quasisymmetry
Reduced passing particle deviation from a flux surface
Reduced direct loss orbits
Reduced neoclassical transport
Reduced equilibrium parallel currents because of the high effective transform
