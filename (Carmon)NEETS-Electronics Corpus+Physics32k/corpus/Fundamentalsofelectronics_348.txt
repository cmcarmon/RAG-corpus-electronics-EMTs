as sum of harmonically related sine waves: sinusoids having frequencies that are integer multiples of
the fundamental frequency. Because the signal has period T , the fundamental frequency is 1/T . The
Fourier series expresses the signal as a superposition of complex exponentials having frequencies k/T , k =
{. . .,âˆ’1, 0, 1, . . .}.
