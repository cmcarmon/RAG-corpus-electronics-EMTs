Facilities at the site include missile launch pads, tracking radar, optical missile tracking systems, cinetheodolites as well as the use of Overberg Air Force Base, home of the South African Air Force Test Flight and Development Centre. The layout appears to mirror the testing site at Palmachim, suggesting Israeli input in the design process.
Instrumentation includes:
IRIG timecode telecommand transmission
Precision instrumentation radars with velocity measurement and ability to track up to three objects simultaneously
Fixed and mobile Doppler radar receivers to track missile velocities with 3 cm/s accuracy
Mobile cine theodolites (5-300 frame/s) and a tracking pedestal with film (25â€“1000 frame/s) and video (50 Hz) capability
Fixed and mobile telemetry stations for receiving real-time flight data
16mm, 35mm and 70mm high-speed cameras for photographic documentation of launches, flights and impacts
Film and video processors for data reduction
Multiple redundant receiving PCM on FM channels
Real-time data manipulation and display capabilities
Quick-look and post-test processing
Atomic clock for accurate timing
Multiple interfaces including IRIG-B, IRIG-A, a variety of slow codes, pulses as well as PC parallel and serial.
Sophisticated command and control infrastructure, including a central control centre, a mobile control centre and a central computer.
