3. Bit-sliced multiplexed data paths supported in Ca-
thedral III are suitable to a medium-level image, video,
and radar processing ranging 1–10 MHz data rates with
irregular and recursive high-speed algorithms. The data
path consists of interconnected dedicated application-
speciﬁc units such as registers, adders, multipliers, and
so on.
