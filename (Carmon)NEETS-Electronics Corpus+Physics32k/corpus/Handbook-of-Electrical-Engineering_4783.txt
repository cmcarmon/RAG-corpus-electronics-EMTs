where A is the area of the device and t the thickness. In this deﬁnition (also used in Table 49.2) e is the relative
dielectric constant and eo is the permittivity of vacuum. Until recently, the dielectric constant, like the polar-
ization,  was  measured  at  50  or  60 Hz  (typical  powerline  frequencies).  Today  the  dielectric  parameters  are
typically speciﬁed at 1 kHz, which is possible because impedance analyzers with high-frequency capability are
readily available. To avoid low-frequency anomalies, even higher frequencies such as 1 MHz are often selected.
This is especially the case when evaluating PZT thin ﬁlms. Low frequency anomalies are not included in the
equivalent circuit (Fig. 49.3) and are due to interface layers. These layers will cause both the resistive and reactive
components to rise at low frequencies producing readings which are not representative of the dielectric properties.
