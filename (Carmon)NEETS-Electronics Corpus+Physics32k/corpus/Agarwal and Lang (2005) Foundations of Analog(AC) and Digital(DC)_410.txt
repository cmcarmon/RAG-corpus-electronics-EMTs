The basic network analysis method introduced in Chapter 2 is fundamental
but unfortunately often insufficient. The problem is that frequently we deal
with complicated circuits in which we are interested in relating only one output
variable to one input variable. For example, in analyzing a high-fidelity audio
amplifier, we might wish to find only the relationship between the voltage at
the output terminals and the voltage at the input terminals. The intermediate
voltage and current variables might be of no direct interest to us, yet by the
analysis method of Chapter 2, we are forced to define all such variables, and then
systematically eliminate them. Even worse, a circuit with N branches, each with
its own voltage and current, will in general have 2N unknown branch variables.
Thus, 2N equations must be solved simultaneously in order to complete the
analysis. Even for a simple circuit, 2N can be an unwieldy number.
