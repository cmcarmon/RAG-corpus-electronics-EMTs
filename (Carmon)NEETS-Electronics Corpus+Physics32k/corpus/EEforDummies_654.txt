You’re witnessing transistor action: The tiny base current passing through 
LED1 is amplified by the transistor, which allows a much larger current to 
flow through LED2. You see a dim glow from LED1 due to the tiny base cur-
rent, and a bright glow from LED2 due to the stronger collector current. You 
can measure each current, if you’d like. (See the sidebar “Measuring teeny 
tiny currents” for a tip on how to measure the small base current.)
