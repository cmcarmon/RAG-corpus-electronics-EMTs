As both the cost and performance of microprocessors con-
tinue to improve, it becomes increasingly attractive to build
computer systems containing many processors. Performance
improvement
is one obvious beneÔ¨Åt of a multiprocessor
system. In the ideal case, a system with N processors can
provide N times speedup of compute-bound tasks. Given
that the cost of a microprocessor is a small fraction of the
total system cost, the cost effectiveness of such an approach is
obvious. A different but equally important reason for using
multiprocessor systems is for better reliability. The idea here is
that even if a single processor fails, the system would continue
to work, though at a slower pace. The workload of the failed
processor would be automatically taken up by the remaining
processors.
