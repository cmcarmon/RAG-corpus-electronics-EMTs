Chapter 6 taught you that a fiber optic transmitter is an electro-optic device capable of accepting
electrical signals, converting them into optical signals, and launching the optical signals into an optical
fiber. The optical signals propagating in the fiber become weakened and distorted because of scattering,
absorption, and dispersion. The fiber optic device responsible for converting the weakened and distorted
optical signal back to an electrical signal is a fiber optic receiver.
