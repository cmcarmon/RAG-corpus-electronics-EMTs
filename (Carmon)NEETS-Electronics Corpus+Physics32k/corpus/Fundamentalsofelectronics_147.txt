Thus, the circuit the voltage source “feels” (through the current drawn from it) is a single resistor having
resistance R1 + R2. Note that in making this equivalent circuit, the output voltage can no longer be deﬁned:
The output resistor labeled R2 no longer appears. Thus, this equivalence is made strictly from the voltage
source’s viewpoint.
