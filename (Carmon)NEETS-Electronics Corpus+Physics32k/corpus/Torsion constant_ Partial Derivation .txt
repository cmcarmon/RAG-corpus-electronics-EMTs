For a beam of uniform cross-section along its length:




θ
=



T
L


J
G





{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {TL}{JG}}}

where




θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle of twist in radians
T is the applied torque
L is the beam length
J is the torsional constant
G is the Modulus of rigidity (shear modulus) of the material
