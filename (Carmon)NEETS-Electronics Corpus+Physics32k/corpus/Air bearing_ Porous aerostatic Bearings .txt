Porous aerostatic bearings utilize porous material such as graphite to allow a uniform gas distribution.
One major advantage is the lack of metal-on-metal contact. Graphite has a natural lubricity. Therefore, if there is any drop in air pressure, the bearing will still function and will not get damaged. Because of this, porous aerostatic bearings are the very reliable. Graphite can be tuned such that the aerostatic bearing will meet requirements of fluid flow, stiffness, load capacity, size, etc. This Video demonstrates a porous air bearing in motion.
