The chosen reference frame determines if an electromagnetic phenomenon is viewed as an effect of electrostatics or magnetism. Authors usually derive magnetism from electrostatics when special relativity and charge invariance are taken into account. The Feynman Lectures on Physics (vol. 2, ch. 13-6) uses this method to derive the "magnetic" force on a moving charge next to a current-carrying wire. See also Haskell and Landau.
