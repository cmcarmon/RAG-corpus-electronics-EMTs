Figure 3-14 is a filter assembly multicoupler that provides seven radio frequency channels in the 14-
kilohertz to 32-megahertz range. Any or all of these channels may be used independently of any of the 
other channels, or they may operate simultaneously. You can make connections to the receiver by means 
of coaxial patch cords, which are short lengths of cable with plugs attached to each end.
