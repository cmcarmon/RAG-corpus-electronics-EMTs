Digital transmission offers an advantage with regard to the acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at
the optical receiver. Digital communications systems can tolerate large amounts of signal loss and
dispersion without impairing the ability of the receiver to distinguish a binary 1 from a binary 0. Digital
signalling also reduces the effects that optical source nonlinearities and temperature have on system
performance. Source nonlinearities and temperature variations can severely affect analog transmission.
Digital transmission provides superior performance in most complex systems (such as LANs) and long-
haul communications systems. In short-haul systems, the cost and complexity of analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog conversion equipment, in some cases, outweigh the benefits of digital transmission.
