The concentration of radioactivity in an average collection of electron tubes in a maintenance shop
does not approach a dangerous level, and the hazards of injury from exposure are slight. However, at
major supply points, the storage of large quantities of radioactive electron tubes in a relatively small area
may create a hazard. For this reason, personnel working with equipment using electron tubes containing
radioactive material, or in areas where a large quantity of radioactive tubes are stored, should read and
become thoroughly familiar with the safety practices contained in Radiation, Health, and Protection
Manual, NAVMED P-5055. Strict compliance with the prescribed safety precautions and procedures of
this manual will help to prevent accidents, and to maintain a safe working environment which is
conducive to good health.
