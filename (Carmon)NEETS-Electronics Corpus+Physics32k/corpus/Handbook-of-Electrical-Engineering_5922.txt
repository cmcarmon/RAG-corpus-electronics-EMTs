AC Motors
Single-phase ac motors occupy the low end of the horsepower spectrum and are offered commercially up to
about  5  hp.  Single-phase  synchronous  motors  are  only  used  below  about  1/10  of  a  horsepower.  Typical
applications are timing and motion control, where low torque is required at Ô¨Åxed speeds. Single-phase induction
motors are used for operating household appliances and machinery from about 1/3 to 5 hp.
