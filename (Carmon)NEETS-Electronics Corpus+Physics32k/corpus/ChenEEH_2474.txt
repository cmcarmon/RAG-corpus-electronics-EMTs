The total radiation is thus separated into two independent
factors. The element factor (EF) is the contribution due to
the individual antenna elements, whereas the array factor (AF)
may be seen as the effect due to the array conﬁguration. Such
factoring into EF and AF allows the study and design of the
array to be used, independent of the speciﬁc antenna elements.
When the antenna input currents are allowed to have different
phases ai as well as different amplitudes jIij, the AF may be
expressed in the following compact form:
