This shows that the voltage response of the RC circuit is an exponen-
tial decay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial
energy stored and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not due
to  some  external  voltage  or  current  source,  it  is  called  the  natural
response of the circuit.
