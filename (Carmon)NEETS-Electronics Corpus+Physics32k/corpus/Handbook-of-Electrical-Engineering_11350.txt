As medical imaging has evolved into a multimodality Ô¨Åeld, the meaning of tomography has broadened to
include  any  images  of  thin  cross-sectional  slices,  regardless  of  the  modality  utilized  to  produce  them.  Thus,
(MRI), ultrasound (US), computerized
tomographic images can be generated by 
single
tomography  (CT),  or  such  nuclear  medicine  techniques  as 
photon emission computerized tomography 
(SPECT). For the purposes of this discussion we will cover all of
the foregoing modalities with the exception of ultrasound, which will be treated separately.
