Figure 8.19 shows the efﬁcacy of this microrollback method,
HC- and CFC-based error detection, and inﬁnite loop detector
at a fault injection repeat frequency of 125 KHz and duty cycle
25% for different patterns of three to four faults injected on the
memory and cache busses. In all cases, the matrix multipli-
cation program that was tested ended with incorrect results
less than 10% of the time, thus achieving a safety probability of
about 90%. This compares to a safety probability in the range
of 50 to 68% for microrollback without using concurrent error
detection via WD-based CFC, thus also demonstrating the
usefulness of CFC.
