When  a  conducting  wire  (consisting  of  several  atoms)  is  con-
nected  to  a  battery  (a  source  of  electromotive  force),  the  charges  are
compelled to move; positive charges move in one direction while neg-
ative  charges  move  in  the  opposite  direction. This  motion  of  charges
creates  electric  current.  It  is  conventional  to  take  the  current  ﬂow  as
the movement of positive charges. That is, opposite to the ﬂow of neg-
ative  charges,  as  Fig.  1.3  illustrates.  This  convention  was  introduced
by Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), the American scientist and inven-
tor. Although we now know that current in metallic conductors is due
to  negatively  charged  electrons,  we  will  follow  the  universally
accepted  convention  that  current  is  the  net  ﬂow  of  positive  charges.
Thus,
