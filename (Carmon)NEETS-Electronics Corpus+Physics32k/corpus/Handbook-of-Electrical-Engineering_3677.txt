The  reason  for  the  discrepancy  is  that  the  simplest  single-domain  model  makes  the  assumption  that  the
spins on all the atoms in a particle rotate in the same direction and at the same time, i.e., are coherent. This
seems to be improbable since switching may begin at different places in the single-domain particle at the same
time.  Jacobs  and  Bean  [1955]  proposed  an  incoherent  mode,  fanning,  in  which  different  segments  on  a
