Geothermal  power  plants  are  the  product  of  the  clean  energy  concept,  although  the  small-scale,  local
application of geothermal energy has a long history. Presently only a few plants are in operation. The potential
for further development is limited because of the unavailability of geothermal energy sites that can be developed
economically.
