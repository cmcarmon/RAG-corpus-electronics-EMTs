Internally, the electrolytic capacitor is constructed similarly to the paper capacitor. The positive plate
consists of aluminum foil covered with an extremely thin film of oxide. This thin oxide film (which is
formed by an electrochemical process) acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. Next to and in contact with the
oxide is a strip of paper or gauze which has been impregnated with a paste-like electrolyte. The electrolyte
acts as the negative plate of the capacitor. A second strip of aluminum foil is then placed against the
electrolyte to provide electrical contact to the negative electrode (the electrolyte). When the three layers are
in place they are rolled up into a cylinder as shown in figure 3-18(A).
