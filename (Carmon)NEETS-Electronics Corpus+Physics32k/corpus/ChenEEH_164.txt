Normalization is one of the most useful concepts in linear
networks. It allows us to reduce one frequency and the network
impedance to unit values without losing any information.
Consider ﬁrst the scaling of impedances. If we increase (de-
crease) the impedance of every element of a ﬁlter described by
its voltage or current transfer function, the input–output rela-
tionship should not change. It is thus customary to apply
scaling, which reduces one (any) resistor to the value of 1.
We can also scale the frequency so that the cutoff frequency of
a low-pass ﬁlter or the center frequency of a band-pass ﬁlter is
reduced to 1 rad/s.
