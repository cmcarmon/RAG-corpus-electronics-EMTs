Gain scheduling is attractive because it exploits linear con-
trol design methods that are theoretically mature, are well-
understood, and involve computationally efﬁcient synthesis
procedures. Because the control design is based on linear
approximations to the plant, the designer can guarantee that
at each operating point, the feedback system has the desired
stability and performance properties. In addition, because the
controller gains are adjusted to reﬂect the plant operating
conditions, the gain-scheduled control system has the poten-
tial of responding rapidly to changing operating conditions.
The gain-scheduling method has been proven sound by suc-
cessful application throughout industry.
