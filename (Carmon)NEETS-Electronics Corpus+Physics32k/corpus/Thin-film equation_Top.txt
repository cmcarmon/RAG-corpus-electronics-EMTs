In physics and engineering, the thin-film equation is a partial differential equation that approximately predicts the time evolution of the x- and y-dependent local thickness h(x,y,t) of a liquid film (puddle, flat drop of liquid) that lies on a flat surface which coincides with the xy-plane. In lubrication theory in fluid mechanics, a body of liquid is assumed to be a thin film, i.e. considerably thinner in one Cartesian direction than in the two directions orthogonal to that. That is one of many problems that can be simplified if one can make some assumptions about the length scales that are relevant for the physical system.
