The voltmeter used to directly measure the precision source need not have an extremely
high â„¦/V sensitivity, because the source will supply all the current it needs to operate. So long
as there is zero voltage across the null detector, there will be zero current between points 1 and
2, equating to no loading of the divider circuit under test.
