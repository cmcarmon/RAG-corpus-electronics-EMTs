Relativistic Newtonian dynamics (RND) is an extension of Newtonian dynamics that overcomes its shortcomings by considering the influence of potential energy on space and time using some principles of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. In its current form, it models the motion of objects with non-zero mass as well as massless particles under the attraction of a time independent conservative force in some inertial frame. Unlike general relativity, RND is not restricted solely to a gravitational potential and does not require the exigency of curving spacetime. Created in 2015, the centennial year of Einstein's general relativity, by Israeli scientists Yaakov Friedman in collaboration with Joseph Steiner, RND predicts accurately both classical and modern tests of general relativity, such as, the perihelion precession of Mercury (planet) which agree with the known observed perihelion precession, the periastron advance of a binary star, which is identical to the post-Keplerian equation of the relativistic advance of the periastron in a binary, gravitational lensing  which is identical to Einstein's formula for weak gravitational lensing using GR, and light travel (Shapiro delay) time delay  which agree with the known formula for the Shapiro time delay, confirmed experimentally by several experiments
Suppose that an object or a particle moves under a conservative, time independent force with a negative potential
