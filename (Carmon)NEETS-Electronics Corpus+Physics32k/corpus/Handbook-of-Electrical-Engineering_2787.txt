In addition to the effects noted above, crosstalk (increasingly problematic for buses whose parallel lines run
long distances) and reﬂections (of increasing importance as the signal frequencies increase) degrade signals.
This broad range of effects impacting signal delay, distortion, and noise have made signal integrity an increasingly
important issue in VLSI design. Signal integrity effects also appear on the “dc” power and ground lines, due
to large transient currents caused by switching gates and switching drivers of output lines.
