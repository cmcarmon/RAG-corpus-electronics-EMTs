With  a  linear  FM/CW  waveform,  the  inverse  of  the  frequency  deviation  provides  the  theoretical  time
resolution, which is 2.1 ns for 480 MHz (or range resolution of 0.3 meter). For an RF sweep linearity of 300 kHz,
the range resolution is actually 5 meters at the 1000-meter nominal search range. (The system has a mechanically
scanned antenna.) An average transmitting power of 25 mW was chosen, which was equal to the average power
of the 5-W peak IMPATT assumed for the pulse system. The antenna diameter was 15 cm. For a target radar
cross section of 20 m2 and assumed weather conditions, the signal-to-clutter and signal-to-noise ratios were
calculated and plotted for ranges out to 2 km and for clear weather or 4 mm per hour rainfall. The results show
that for 1 km range the target-to-clutter ratios are higher for the FM/CW case than the pulse system in clear
weather or in rain, and target-to-clutter is the determining factor.
