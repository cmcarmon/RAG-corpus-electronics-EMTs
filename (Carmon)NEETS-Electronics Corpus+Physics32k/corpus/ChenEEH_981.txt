The application of the computer implementation described in
Section 4.6.1 to many of the circuits listed in Table 4.3 is
graphically illustrated. Immediately following are illustrations
of two circuits shown in Figures 4.14 and 4.15, respectively.
Three histograms for a circuit are shown in each graphical
illustration. These histograms are as follows:
