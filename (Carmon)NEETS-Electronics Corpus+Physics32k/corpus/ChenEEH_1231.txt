An evolutionary programming approach was used in the
track assignment algorithm to minimize the total number of
tracks used. Yim and Kyung (1999) proposed an evolutionary
programming-based track assignment (EPTA) algorithm
considering both length and switching activity. They showed
that the solution quality of EPTA is quite good, and the
converging speed is very fast when compared with SA and
GA. More than anything else, EPTA does not require an
annoying genetic operator design, which makes the implemen-
tation of EPTA very easy.
