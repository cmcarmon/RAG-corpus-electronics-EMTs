another, and a soldering iron in still another. Also, you may be using an extension cord for some
equipments and not others or may be using other possible combinations. Some of the hazards presented
by situations such as these include contact with live terminals or test leads. In addition, cords and test
leads may be cross connected in such a manner that a potential difference exists between the metal cases
of the instruments. This potential difference may cause serious or fatal shocks.
