Notice  that  in  general  more  combinational  logic  gates  will  be  required  for  D  ﬂip-ﬂop  implementations
compared  to  J-K  ﬂip-ﬂop  implementations  of  the  same  synchronous  sequential  function.  Using  a  registered
PAL  such  as  a  PAL16RP4A  would  only  require  one  IC  package  to  implement  the  circuit  in  Fig. 81.24.  The
PAL16RP4A has four edge-triggered D ﬂip-ﬂops in its output section, of which only two are required for this design.
Generally  speaking,  synchronous  sequential  logic  circuits  can  be  designed  much  more  easily  (considering
design time as the criteria) than fundamental-mode asynchronous sequential logic circuits. With a system clock
and edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops, a designer does not have to worry about hazards or glitches (momentary error
conditions that occur at the outputs of combinational logic circuits), since outputs are allowed to become stable
before the next clock edge occurs. Thus, sequential logic circuit designs allow the use of combinational hazardous
circuits as well as the use of arbitrary state assignments, provided the resulting combinational logic gate count
or package count is acceptable.
