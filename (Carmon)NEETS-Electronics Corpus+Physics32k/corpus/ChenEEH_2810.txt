The Discrete Space
Grading of the PML Loss Parameters
Theoretically, reﬂectionless wave transmission can take place
across a PML interface regardless of the local step-discontinu-
ity in s and s presented to the continuous impinging elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. However,
in FDTD or any discrete
representation of Maxwell’s equations, numerical artifacts
arise due to the ﬁnite spatial sampling. Consequently, imple-
menting PML as a single-step discontinuity of s and s in the
FDTD lattice leads to signiﬁcant spurious wave reﬂection at
the PML surface.
