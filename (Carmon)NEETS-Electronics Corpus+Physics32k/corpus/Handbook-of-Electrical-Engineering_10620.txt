Task-Ambient Lighting. This is a particular form of nonuniform illumination that combines task illuminance
and ambient illuminance. One advantage is improved energy efﬁciency. The task component of task-ambient
lighting  may  take  two  forms:  (1)  furniture-mounted  lighting  built  into  a  workstation  or  (2)  ﬂoor-mounted
ﬁxtures that can be placed adjacent to a desk. The ambient lighting component may be supplied in two ways:
(1) conventional luminaires on the ceiling or (2) indirect ﬁxtures utilizing HID or ﬂuorescent lamps with the
output  directed  to  the  ceiling  and  adjacent  walls.  For  ceiling-mounted  troffers  used  for  ambient  lighting,  a
plug-in system of wiring should be considered so that luminaires can be relocated as task locations change.
