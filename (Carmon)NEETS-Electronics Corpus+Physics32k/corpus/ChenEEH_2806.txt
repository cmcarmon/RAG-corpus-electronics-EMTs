The second step involves updating the ~HH components in the
UPML using the values of the ~BB components just obtained
with equation 9.122 and similar expressions for By and Bz.
For example, employing the dual constitutive relation BBx ¼
^
m(sz=sx)H
followed in

obtaining equation 9.121 yields the following update for Hx :
