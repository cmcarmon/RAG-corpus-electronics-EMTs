In both the tone-modulated system and the carrier-frequency shift system, all tty signals pass through 
the tty panel that controls the looping current in all the circuits. Looping current is the current supplied by 
the tty battery. The tty panel integrates the tone-modulated and the carrier-frequency shift systems. It 
provides every possible interconnection of available tty equipment. With this configuration maximum 
operational flexibility is achieved with the least amount of circuitry and equipment.
