The plane waves repeat as they travel along the fiber axis. The direction the plane waves travel is
assumed to be the z direction as shown in figure 2-15. The plane waves repeat at a distance equal to
ÿ/sin� . Plane waves also repeat at a periodic frequency b = 2p sin � /ÿ. The quantity b is defined as the
propagation constant along the fiber axis. As the wavelength (ÿ) changes, the value of the propagation
