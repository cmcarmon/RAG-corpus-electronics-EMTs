The  presence  of  controlled  sources  negates  the  advantages  of  the  method  that  uses  series  and  parallel
combinations of resistors for voltage and current dividers. The problem is that the couplings between circuit
variables that are expressed by controlled sources make all the familiar formulas unreliable.
