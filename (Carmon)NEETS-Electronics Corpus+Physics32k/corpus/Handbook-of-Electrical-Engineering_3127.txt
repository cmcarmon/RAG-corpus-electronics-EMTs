An important feature of a power MOSFET is the absence of
a  secondary  breakdown  effect,  which  is  present  in  a  bipolar
transistor, and as a result, it has an extremely rugged switching
 increases with temperature,
performance. In MOSFETs, 
and thus the current is automatically diverted away from the hot
spot. The drain body junction appears as an antiparallel diode
between source and drain. Thus power MOSFETs will not sup-
port voltage in the reverse direction. Although this inverse diode
is  relatively  fast,  it  is  slow  by  comparison  with  the  MOSFET.
Recent devices have the diode recovery time as low as 100 ns. Since MOSFETs cannot be protected by fuses,
an electronic protection technique has to be used.
