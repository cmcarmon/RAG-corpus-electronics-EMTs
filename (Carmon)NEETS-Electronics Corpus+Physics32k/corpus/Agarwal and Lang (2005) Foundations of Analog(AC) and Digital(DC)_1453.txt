Another advantage of the state variable point of view is that it allows us to
solve transient problems by superposition. Specifically, we find first the zero-
input response, the response for the true initial conditions, with the input drive
zero. Then we find the zero-state response, the response of the circuit when
the initial state is zero, that is, all capacitor voltages and inductor currents are
initially zero. The total response is the sum of the zero-input response (ZIR)
and the zero-state response (ZSR).
