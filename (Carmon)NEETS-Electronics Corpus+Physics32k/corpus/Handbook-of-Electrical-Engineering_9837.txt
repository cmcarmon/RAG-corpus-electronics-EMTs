Figure 100.10 illustrates the gain versus frequency and phase versus frequency curves for a simple lead network
with the transfer function of the foregoing equation. The maximum phase lead obtainable from a phase-lead
network depends upon the ratio w
1 that is used in designing the network. From the expression for the phase
shift of the transfer function for this system, which is given by
