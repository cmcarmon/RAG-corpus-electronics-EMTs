Energy and power 
 
At  first  you  may  be  a  little  confused  about  the 
difference between energy and power. Put simply, 
energy is the ability to do work while power is the 
rate  at  which  work  is  done.  In  electrical  circuits, 
energy is supplied by batteries or generators. It may 
also be stored in components such as capacitors and 
inductors.  Electrical  energy 
into 
various other forms of energy by components such 
as 
loudspeakers 
(producing sound energy) and light emitting diodes 
(producing light). 
  The unit of energy is the Joule (J). Power is the 
rate  of  use  of  energy  and  it  is  measured  in  Watts 
(W).  A  power  of  1W  results  from  energy  being 
used at the rate of 1 J per second. Thus: 
 
P = W / t
where P is the power in Watts (W), W is the energy 
in Joules (J), and t is the time in seconds (s). 
  The  power  in  a  circuit  is  equivalent  to  the 
product of voltage and current. Hence: 
 
P = I Ã—V
where P is the power in Watts (W), I is the current 
in Amperes (A), and V is the voltage in Volts (V).
