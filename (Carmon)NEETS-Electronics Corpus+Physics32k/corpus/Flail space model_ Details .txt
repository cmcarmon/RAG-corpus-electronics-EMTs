The FSM hypothesis divides the collision into two stages. In stage one, the unrestrained occupant is propelled forward and sideways in the compartment space due to vehicle collision accelerations and then impacts one or more surfaces (including the steering wheel) with velocity "V". According to the model, the vehicle (instead of the occupant) is the object that is accelerating. The occupant experiences no injury-producing force prior to contact with the compartment surfaces.
In stage two, the occupant is assumed to remain in contact with the compartment surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of the collision. The occupant may sustain injury at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two. The occupant impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry. Finally, the hypothetical occupant impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of human tolerance to these forces.
