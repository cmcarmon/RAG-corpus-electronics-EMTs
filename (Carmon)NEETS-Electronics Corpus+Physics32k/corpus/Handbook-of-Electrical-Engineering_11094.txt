An invasive (implantable) dc device (F, G in Table 113.2) is also shown on Fig. 113.34. The small (approx-
imately 4 · 2 · 0.5 cm) titanium case contains a long-life battery that is connected to it. The case acts as the
anode, and two (shown) or four titanium wires act as the cathode. The amplitude of the continuous current
is between 5 mA (for some spinal fusion applications) and 20 mA (for nonunion of long bones). The cathodes
are placed at the location where bone growth is to be enhanced, for example, at the vertebrae that are surgically
fused, while the case is placed in a convenient location at some distance from the bone. Treatment details and
success rates, in comparison with surgical procedures without use of dc stimulation, are discussed in the medical
literature [Nerubay et al., 1986].
