The H‘ control problem can be deﬁned in terms of the
general closed-loop block diagram in Figure 3.2 where the
exogenous signals are included in the vector v(s) and an
appropriate choice of performance variables is given by the
vector z(s). The TFM P(s) includes frequency-dependent
weights and appropriate normalization as described previ-
ously. Consider the following realization of P(s):
