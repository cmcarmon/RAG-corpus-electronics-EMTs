working frequency limits), and the regulation  of a 
transformer  (usually  expressed  as  a  percentage  of 
full-load). This last specification is a measure of the 
ability of a transformer to maintain its rated output 
voltage under load. 
  Table  4.2  summarizes  the  properties  of  three 
common  types  of  transformer.  Figure  4.20  shows 
the  construction  of  a  typical  iron-cored  power 
transformer.
