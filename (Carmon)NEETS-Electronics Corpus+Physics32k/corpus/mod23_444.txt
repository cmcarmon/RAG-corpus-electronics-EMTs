This part of the hard disk drive transport positions the magnetic heads so they can write data to and 
read data from the correct track of the hard disk. It does this by using either a stepper motor or a voice 
coil servo. A stepper motor is a special type of dc motor which can be moved in very small steps to 
accurately position the magnetic heads. A voice coil servo by itself cannot move the magnetic heads from 
track to track. Instead, it must use special signals called servo signals to make sure it's positioning the 
heads where they should be. The servo signals are pre-recorded signals which are stored on either the 
same hard disk platter as the data or on a separate hard disk platter.
