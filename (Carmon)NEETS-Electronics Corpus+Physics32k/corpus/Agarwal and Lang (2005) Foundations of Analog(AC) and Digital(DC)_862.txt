It is easy to see that the MOSFET operates like a switch connected to the
source and the drain that turns on when the gate voltage exceeds a threshold.
Figure 6.37 shows how metal connections are made to the MOSFET terminals
G, S, and D so the MOSFET can be coupled to other devices. As shown in
the figure, the layers of metal are separated by layers of oxide (thickness is
not to scale), so the metal does not inadvertently come in contact with other
parts of the device.18 Contact holes are etched between pairs of layers between
