The main difference between transmission and distribution
used to be that transmission lines transferred larger amounts of
power at higher voltages over longer distances, while distribu-
tion lines transferred smaller amounts of power at lower volt-
ages locally. However, distribution lines are radial, and the
major distinction between transmission lines and distribution
lines today is that the transmission system is a meshed network,
while the distribution system is radial. In terms of voltages, all
lines over 100 KV are always meshed and part of the transmis-
sion system, and all voltages below 30 KV are always radial and
are classiÔ¨Åed as distribution. The in-between voltage levels (e.g.,
69 KV or 34.5 KV) are sometimes radial in sparsely populated
rural areas while meshed in densely populated downtown urban
areas; when they are in a mesh network, the term subtransmis-
sion is sometimes used for these voltage levels.
