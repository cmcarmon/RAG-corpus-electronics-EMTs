A conscious person in shock may complain of thirst and have a feeling of weakness, faintness, or 
dizziness. The victim may feel nauseous, restless, frightened, and/or anxious. As shock deepens, these 
signs gradually disappear and the victim becomes less and less responsive to what is going on. Even pain 
may not arouse the shock victim. Finally, the victim may become unconscious.
