Much of todayâ€™s modern electrical and electronic equipment could not function without magnetism.
Modern computers, tape recorders, and video reproduction equipment use magnetized tape. High-fidelity
speakers use magnets to convert amplifier outputs into audible sound. Electrical motors use magnets to
convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; generators use magnets to convert mechanical motion
into electrical energy.
