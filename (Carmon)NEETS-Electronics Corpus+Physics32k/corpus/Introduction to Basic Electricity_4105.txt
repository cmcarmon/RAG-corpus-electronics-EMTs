square off the peaks of an applied signal, obtain a rect-
angular waveform from a sine-wave signal, eliminate 
positive or negative portions of a waveform, or keep 
an input amplitude at a constant level. The diode is 
forward biased and conducts during the positive por-
tion of the input signal. During the negative portion 
of the input signal, the diode is reverse biased and 
does not conduct. Figure 40-18 shows the effect of 
reversing the diode: The positive portion of the input 
signal is clipped off. The circuit is essentially a half-
wave rectifier.
