A lot is an old unit of weight used in many European countries since the Middle Ages until the beginning of the 20th century. Most often it was defined as either ​1⁄30 or ​1⁄32 of a pound (or more precisely of whatever mass value one local pound had at the time). Recorded values range from 10 to 50 grams.
