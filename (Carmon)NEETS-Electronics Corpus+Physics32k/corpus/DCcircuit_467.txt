Just as in the case of series circuits, the same caveat for Ohm’s Law applies: values for
voltage, current, and resistance must be in the same context in order for the calculations to
work correctly. However, in the above example circuit, we can immediately apply Ohm’s Law
to each resistor to ﬁnd its current because we know the voltage across each resistor (9 volts)
and the resistance of each resistor:
