Other Uses of Distance Relays
Although  the  primary  use  of  distance  relays  is  in  protecting  transmission  lines,  some  other  protection  tasks
can also be served by distance relays. For example, loss-of-Ô¨Åeld protection of generators is often based upon
distance relays. Out-of-step relays and relays for protecting reactors may also be distance relays. Distance relays
are also used in pilot protection schemes described next, and as backup relays for power apparatus.
