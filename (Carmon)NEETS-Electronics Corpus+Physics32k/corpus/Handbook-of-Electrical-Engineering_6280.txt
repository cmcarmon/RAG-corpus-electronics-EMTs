The  amount  of  output  power  required  of  a  transmitter  will  have  a  fundamental  effect  on  system  design.
Power levels dictate whether the unit will be of solid-state or vacuum-tube design; whether air, water, or vapor
cooling must be used; the type of power supply required; the sophistication of the high-voltage control and
supervisory circuitry; and many other parameters.
