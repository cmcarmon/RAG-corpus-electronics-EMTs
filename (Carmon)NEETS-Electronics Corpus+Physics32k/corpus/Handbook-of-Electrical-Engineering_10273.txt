This McDonnell Douglas conceptual design for a Mach 2.4 supersonic trans-
port is sized to carry about 300 passengers over a distance of 5,000 nautical
miles. A NASA/industry high speed civil transport research effort is a Ô¨Årst
step toward determining whether such a plane can be economically viable
and  environmentally  acceptable.  (Photo  Courtesy  of  National Aeronautics
