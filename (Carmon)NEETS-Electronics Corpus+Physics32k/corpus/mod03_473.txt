the number of places in which the switch opens or breaks the circuit. All of the switches shown so far
have been single-break switches. A double-break switch is shown in figure 3-5. The schematic symbol
shown in figure 3-5(A) shows that this switch breaks the circuit in two places (at both terminals). The
upper part of the schematic symbol indicates that these contacts are in the open position and the circuit
will close when the switch is acted upon (manually or automatically). The lower symbol shows closed
contacts. These contacts will open the circuit when the switch is acted upon.
