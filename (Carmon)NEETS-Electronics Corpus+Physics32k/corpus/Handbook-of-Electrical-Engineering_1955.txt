While look-ahead can transform any recursive digital ﬁlter transfer function to pipelined form, it leads to a
hardware overhead proportional to N log2 M, where N is the ﬁlter order and M is the speed-up factor. Instead
of  starting  with  a  sequential  digital  ﬁlter  transfer  function  obtained  by  traditional  design  approaches  and
transforming it for pipelining, it is more desirable to use a constrained ﬁlter design program that can satisfy
the  ﬁlter  spectrum  and  the  pipelining  constraint.  The  pipelining  constraint  is  satisﬁed  by  expressing  the
denominator of the transfer function in scattered look-ahead form. Such ﬁlter design programs have now been
developed in both time domain and frequency domain. The advantage of the constrained ﬁlter design approach
is that we can obtain pipelined digital ﬁlters with marginal or zero hardware overhead compared with sequential
digital ﬁlters. The pipelined transfer functions can also be mapped to pipelined lattice digital ﬁlters. The reader
might note that the data ﬂow graph of Fig. 18.3(a) was obtained by this approach.
