Devices and systems that require allocation of the frequency spectrum fall under either type acceptance or
type approval equipment authorization procedures. These radio frequency devices usually radiate high powers
as in radio or television broadcast transmitters. Radio frequency devices not within the allocated part of the
RF spectrum would require either certiﬁcation or veriﬁcation equipment authorizations. Some receivers, such
as  pagers,  require  notiﬁcation  equipment  authorization  as  well.  The  requirements  for  these  types  of  radio
frequency devices are listed in Part 15 of the CFR, Title 47.
