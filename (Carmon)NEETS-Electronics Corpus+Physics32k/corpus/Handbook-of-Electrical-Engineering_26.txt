High-Frequency Effects
Resistors show a change in their resistance value when subjected
to ac voltages. The change in resistance with voltage frequency is
 The effect occurs because all resistors
known as the 
have  some  inductance  and  capacitance  along  with  the  resistive
component and thus can be approximated by an equivalent circuit
shown in Fig. 1.6. Even though the deÔ¨Ånition of useful frequency
range is application dependent, typically, the useful range of the
resistor  is  the  highest  frequency  at  which  the  impedance  differs
from the resistance by more than the tolerance of the resistor.
