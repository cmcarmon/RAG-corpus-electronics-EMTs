Configuring transistor amplifier circuits
The type of transistor setup I discuss in the preceding section is known as a 
common‐emitter amplifier (so‐named because the emitter is tied to common 
ground); this circuit is just one of many ways to configure transistor circuits 
for use as amplifiers. You use different configurations to achieve different 
goals, such as high power gain versus high voltage gain. How the circuit 
behaves depends on
