In figure 3-33, a short is caused by improper wiring. Note the effect on current flow. Since the
resistor has in effect been replaced with a piece of wire, practically all the current flows through the short
and very little current flows through the resistor. Electrons flow through the short (a path of almost zero
resistance) and the remainder of the circuit by passing through the 10-ohm resistor and the battery. The
amount of current flow increases greatly because its resistive path has decreased from 10,010 ohms to 10
ohms. Due to the excessive current flow the 10-ohm resistor becomes heated. As it attempts to dissipate
this heat, the resistor will probably be destroyed. Figure 3-34 shows a pictorial wiring diagram, rather
than a schematic diagram, to indicate how broken insulation might cause a short circuit.
