Besides vertical npn transistors, variants of pnp transistors
are offered in processes, since they are required for certain
circuit applications, such as bias networks or push-pull
stages. Only few truly complementary bipolar processes do
exist (Yamaguchi et al., 1994); that is, in most cases the pnp
