where Va is the terminal voltage of the armature winding, Ra its effective resistance including brush drops, Laq
its inductance, vf the applied ﬁeld voltage, Rf and Lf, the ﬁeld circuit resistance and inductance. For motoring,
positive Ia will ﬂow into the positive terminal of Va, as power ﬂows from the external voltage source into the
armature winding. Like the physical device, the model is capable of motoring and generating, and the transition
from one mode to the other will take place naturally.
