Assume that the function ƒ(x) has a unique global maximum at x0. Then, the value ƒ(x0) will be larger than the other values of ƒ(x). If we multiply this function by a large number M, the ratio between Mƒ(x0) and Mƒ(x) will stay the same (since Mƒ(x0)/Mƒ(x) = ƒ(x0)/ƒ(x)), but it will grow exponentially in the function

(see figure).
Thus, significant contributions to the integral of this function will come only from points x in a neighbourhood of x0, which can then be estimated.
