MELP
The MELP coder [McCree and Barnwell, 1995] is based on the traditional LPC vocoder model where an LPC
synthesis  ﬁlter  is  excited  by  an  impulse  train  (voiced  speech)  or  white  noise  (unvoiced  speech).  The  MELP
excitation, however, has characteristics that are more similar to natural human speech. In particular, the MELP
excitation  can  be  a  mixture  of  (possibly  aperiodic)  pulses  with  bandlimited  noise.  In  MELP,  the  excitation
spectrum is explicitly modeled using Fourier series coefﬁcients and bandpass voicing strengths, and the time-
domain  excitation  sequence  is  produced  from  the  spectral  model  via  an  inverse  transform.  The  synthetic
excitation sequence is then used to drive an LPC synthesizer which introduces formant spectral shaping.
