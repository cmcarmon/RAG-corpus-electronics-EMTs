Figure 2-19 is the schematic diagram of a typical rf amplifier that is used in an AM radio receiver. In
figure 2-19, the input circuit is the antenna of the radio (L1-a coil) which forms part of an LC circuit
which is tuned to the desired station by variable capacitor C1. L1 is wound on the same core as L2, which
couples the input signal through C2 to the transistor (Q1). R1 is used to provide proper bias to Q1 from
the base power supply (VBB). R2 provides proper bias to the emitter of Q1, and C3 is used to bypass R2.
The primary of T1 and capacitor C4 form a parallel LC circuit which acts as the load for Q1. This LC
circuit is tuned by C4, which is ganged to C1 allowing the antenna and the LC circuit to be tuned
together. The primary of T1 is center-tapped to provide proper impedance matching with Q1.
