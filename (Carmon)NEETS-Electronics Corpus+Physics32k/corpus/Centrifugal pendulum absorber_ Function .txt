The function of a centrifugal pendulum absorber is as with any tuned mass absorbers based on an absorption principle rather than a damping principle. The distinction is significant since dampers reduce the vibration amplitude by converting the vibration energy into heat. Absorbers store the energy and return it to the vibration system at the appropriate time. Centrifugal pendulum absorbers like tuned mass absorbers are not part of the force/torque flow.
The centrifugal pendulum absorber differs from the tuned mass absorber in the absorption range. It is effective for an entire order instead of a narrow frequency range.
