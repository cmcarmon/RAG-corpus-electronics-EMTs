In a grown junction method (the earliest technique 
used), intrinsic semiconductor material and P-type 
impurities are placed in a quartz container and heated 
until they melt. A small semiconductor crystal, called 
a seed, is then lowered into the molten mixture. The 
seed crystal is slowly rotated and withdrawn from the 
molten mixture slowly enough to allow the molten mix-
ture to cling to the seed. The molten mixture, clinging 
to the seed crystal, cools and rehardens, assuming the 
same crystalline characteristics as the seed. As the seed 
crystal is withdrawn, it is alternately doped with N- and  
P-type impurities. Doping is the process of adding 
 impurities to pure semiconductor crystals to increase the 
number of free electrons or the number of holes. This 
creates N and P layers in the crystal as it is grown. The 
resulting crystal is then sliced into many Pâ€“N sections.
