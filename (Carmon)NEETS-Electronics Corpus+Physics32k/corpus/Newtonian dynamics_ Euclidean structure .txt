The configuration space and the phase space of the dynamical system (3) both are Euclidean spaces, i. e. they are equipped with a Euclidean structure. The Euclidean structure of them is defined so that the kinetic energy of the single multidimensional particle with the unit mass




m
=
1



{\displaystyle \displaystyle m=1}
is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of the three-dimensional particles with the masses
