In Sonic the Hedgehog series, Shadow the Hedgehog can use Chaos Emerald's power called "Chaos Control", when he can teleport himself to the other place. Sonic the Hedgehog and some other characters and enemies can use the same power.
In the stage "Mystic Mansion" on Sonic Heroes, there are teleporters called "Switch Balls" with symbols on the pad and the ball that can allow players to teleport if they touch it. The active switch ball has glowing symbols on the ball. These will release symbol particles spreading from the pad and the blue light starts to permeate on the middle of the screen. Once teleported to another room in the stage, the switch balls will stop glowing and become inactive. Thus, it cannot be reverted.
