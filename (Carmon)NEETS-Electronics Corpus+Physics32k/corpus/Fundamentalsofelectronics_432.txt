You won’t ﬁnd this Fourier transform in our table, and the required integral is diﬃcult to evaluate
as the expression stands. This situation requires cleverness and an understanding of the Fourier
transform’s properties. In particular, recall Euler’s relation for the sinusoidal term and note the
fact that multiplication by a complex exponential in the frequency domain amounts to a time delay.
Let’s momentarily make the expression for Y (f ) .
