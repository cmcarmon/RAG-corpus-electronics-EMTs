▶✓ Wire: Ample 20–22 gauge solid wire. You can buy a 100‐foot roll in any 
one of a variety of colors for about $7. You cut it to various lengths and 
strip the insulation off each end to connect components. You can solder 
each end to a component lead, or insert each end into contact holes on 
your solderless breadboard. Some electronics suppliers sell kits contain-
ing dozens of precut, prestripped jumper wires of various lengths and 
colors, ideal for use in solderless breadboards. A kit with 140–350 jumper 
wires may cost you $8–$12, but it can save you the time (and trouble) of 
cutting and stripping your own wire. (Plus, you get rainbow colors!)
