The  light-emitting  diode  (LED)  has  found  a  multitude  of  roles  as  the  ﬁeld  of  optoelectronics  has  bloomed.
Infrared devices are used in conjunction with spectrally matched phototransistors in optoisolation couplers,
hand-held remote controllers, interruptive, reﬂective and ﬁber-optic sensing techniques, etc. Visible spectrum
applications include simple status indicators and dynamic power level bar graphs on a stereo or tape deck. This
section will concentrate on digital display applications of visible output devices.
