A single-loop generator with each terminal connected to a segment of a two-segment metal ring is 
shown in figure 1-4. The two segments of the split metal ring are insulated from each other. This forms a 
simple COMMUTATOR. The commutator in a dc generator replaces the slip rings of the ac generator. 
This is the main difference in their construction. The commutator mechanically reverses the armature 
loop connections to the external circuit. This occurs at the same instant that the polarity of the voltage in 
the armature loop reverses. Through this process the commutator changes the generated ac voltage to a 
pulsating dc voltage as shown in the graph of figure 1-4. This action is known as commutation. 
Commutation is described in detail later in this chapter.
