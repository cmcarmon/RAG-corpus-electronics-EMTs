A SCADA system consists of a master station that communicates with 
(RTUs) for the
purpose  of  allowing  operators  to  observe  and  control  physical  plants.  Generating  plants  and  transmission
substations certainly justify RTUs, and their installation is becoming more common in distribution substations
as costs decrease. RTUs transmit device status and measurements to, and receive control commands and setpoint
data from, the master station. Communication is generally via dedicated circuits operating in the range of 600
to 4800 bits/s with the RTU responding to periodic requests initiated from the master station (polling) every
2 to 10 s, depending on the criticality of the data.
