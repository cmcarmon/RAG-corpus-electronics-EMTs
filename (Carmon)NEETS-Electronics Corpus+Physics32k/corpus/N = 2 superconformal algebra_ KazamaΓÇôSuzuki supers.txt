Kazama & Suzuki (1989) generalized the SU(2) coset construction to any pair consisting of a simple compact Lie group



G


{\displaystyle G}
and a closed subgroup



H


{\displaystyle H}
of maximal rank, i.e. containing a maximal torus



T


{\displaystyle T}
of



G


{\displaystyle G}
, with the additional condition that the dimension of the centre of



H


{\displaystyle H}
is non-zero. In this case the compact Hermitian symmetric space



G

/

H


{\displaystyle G/H}
is a Kähler manifold, for example when



H
=
T


{\displaystyle H=T}
. The physical states lie in a single orbit of the affine Weyl group, which again implies the Weyl–Kac character formula for the affine Kac–Moody algebra of



G


{\displaystyle G}
.
