The vertical force generated by a bicycle tire is approximately equal to the product of inflation pressure and contact patch area. In reality, is it usually slightly more than this because of the small but finite rigidity of the sidewalls.
The vertical stiffness, or spring rate, of a bicycle tire, as with motorcycle and automobile tires, increases with inflation pressure.
