Mineral oil used in transformer insulation systems degrades
with prolonged exposure to oxygen. Moreover, mineral oil has
a fairly large thermal expansion coefﬁcient. In recognition of
this disadvantage, several systems are used to minimize deg-
radation. Liquid-ﬁlled transformers normally protect insulat-
ing oil with one of three types of preservation systems: sealed
tank system, nitrogen blanked, or conservator.
