relationship. It also times the interval between transmitted pulses to ensure that the interval is of the
proper length. Timing pulses are used to ensure synchronous circuit operation and are related to the prf.
The prf can be set by any stable oscillator, such as a sine-wave oscillator, multivibrator, or a blocking
oscillator. That output is then applied to pulse-shaping circuits to produce timing pulses. Associated
components can be timed by the output of the synchronizer or by a timing signal from the transmitter as it
is turned on.
