The definition of angular momentum for a single particle is:





L

=

r

×

p



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times {\boldsymbol {p}}}

where "×" indicates the vector cross product, p is the particle's linear momentum, and r is the displacement vector from the origin (the origin is assumed to be a fixed location anywhere in space). The time-derivative of this is:








d


L

r

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times {\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}+{\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}

This result can easily be proven by splitting the vectors into components and applying the product rule. Now using the definition of force




F

=




d


p




d

t





{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\boldsymbol {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}}
(whether or not mass is constant) and the definition of velocity







d


r




d

t



=

v



{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {v} }









d

d

t



=

F

+

v

×

p

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {v} \times {\boldsymbol {p}}.}

The cross product of momentum




p



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {p}}}
with its associated velocity




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is zero because velocity and momentum are parallel, so the second term vanishes.
By definition, torque τ = r × F. Therefore, torque on a particle is equal to the first derivative of its angular momentum with respect to time.
If multiple forces are applied, Newton's second law instead reads Fnet = ma, and it follows that

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {L} }{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {net} }={\boldsymbol {\tau }}_{\mathrm {net} }.}

This is a general proof.
