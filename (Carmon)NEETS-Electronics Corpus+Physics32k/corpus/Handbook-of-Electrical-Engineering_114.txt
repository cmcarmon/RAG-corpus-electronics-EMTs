1. The inductance is proportional to the square of the turns.
2. The inductance increases as the length of the winding is increased.
3. A shorted turn decreases the inductance, affects the frequency response, and increases the insertion loss.
4. The inductance increases as the permeability of the core material increases.
5. The inductance increases with an increase in the cross-sectional area of the core material.
6. Inductance is increased by inserting an iron core into the coil.
7. Introducing an air gap into a choke reduces the inductance.
