A simple linear mechanical system, consisting of a mass on a spring that is attached to a wall. The mass has some force being applied to it. An image of the system is shown below.

For a mechanical system, the first step is to place a 1-junction at each distant velocity, in this case there are two distant velocities, the mass and the wall. It is usually helpful to label the 1-junctions for reference. The result is below.

{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}&&\\&&\\1_{mass}&&\\&&\\&&\\&&\\1_{wall}&&\end{matrix}}}

The next step is to draw the R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1-junctions where they act. For this example there is only one of these bonds, the C bond for the spring. It acts between the 1-junction representing the mass and the 1-junction representing the wall. The result is below.

Next you want to add the sources and I bonds on the 1-junction where they act. There is one source, the source of effort (force) and one I bond, the mass of the mass both of which act on the 1-junction of the mass. The result is shown below.

Next you want to assign power flow. Like the electrical examples, power should flow towards ground, in this case the 1-junction of the wall. Exceptions to this are R,C, or I bond, which always point towards the element. The resulting bond graph is below.

Now that the bond graph has been generated, it can be simplified. Because the wall is grounded (has zero velocity), you can remove that junction. As such the 0-junction the C bond is on, can also be removed because it will then have less than three bonds. The simplified bond graph can be seen below.

The last step is to apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.
