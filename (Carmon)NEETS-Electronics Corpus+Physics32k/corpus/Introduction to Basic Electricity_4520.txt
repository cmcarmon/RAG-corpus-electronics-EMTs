Shift registers can perform arithmetic operations 
such as multiplication or division. Shifting a binary 
number stored in the shift register to the right has the 
same effect as dividing the number by some power of 
2. Shifting the binary number stored in the shift reg-
ister to the left has the same effect as multiplying the 
number by some power of 2. Shift registers are a sim-
ple and inexpensive means of performing multiplica-
tion and division of numbers.
