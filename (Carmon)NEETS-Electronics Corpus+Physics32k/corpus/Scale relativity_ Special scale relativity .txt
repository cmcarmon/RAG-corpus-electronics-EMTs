Special scale relativity can be seen as a correction of galilean scale relativity, where Galilean transformations are replaced by Lorentz transformations. Interestingly, the "corrections remain small at 'large' scale (i.e. around the Compton scale of particles) and increase when going to smaller length scales (i.e. large energies) in the same way as motion-relativistic corrections increase when going to large speeds".
In Galilean relativity, it was considered "obvious" that we could add speeds without limit (w = u + v). This composition laws for speed was not challenged. However, Poincaré and Einstein did challenge it with special relativity, setting a maximum speed on movement, the speed of light. Formally, if v is a velocity, v + c = c. The status of the speed of light in special relativity is a horizon, unreachable, impassable, invariant under changes of movement.
Regarding scale, we are still within a Galilean kind of thinking. Indeed, we assume without justification that the composition of two dilations is ρ * ρ = ρ2. Written with logarithms, this equality becomes lnρ + lnρ = 2lnρ. However, nothing guarantees that this law should hold at quantum or cosmic scales. As a matter of fact, this dilation law is corrected in special scale relativity, and becomes: ln ρ + ln ρ = 2 ln ρ / (1 + ln ρ2).
More generally, in special relativity the composition law for velocities differs from the Galilean approximation and becomes (with the speed of light c = 1):
u ⊕ v = (u + v) / (1 + u * v)
Similarly, in special scale relativity, the composition law for dilations differs from our Galilean intuitions and becomes (in a logarithm of base K which includes a possible constant C = ln K, which plays the same role as c):
logρ1 ⊕ logρ2 = (logρ1 + logρ2) / (1 + logρ1 * logρ2)
The status of the Planck scale in special scale relativity plays a similar role as the speed of light in special relativity. It is a horizon for small scales, unreachable, impassable, invariant under scale changes, i.e. dilations and contractions. The consequence for special scale relativity is that applying two times the same contraction ρ to an object, the result is a contraction less strong than contraction ρ x ρ. Formally, if ρ is a contraction, ρ * lP = lP.
As noted above, there is also an unreachable, impassable maximum scale, invariant under scale changes, which is the cosmic length L. In particular, it is invariant under the expansion of the universe.
