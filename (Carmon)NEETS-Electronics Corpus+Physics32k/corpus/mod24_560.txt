If the length of the fiber point defect changes with the pulse duration, then the OTDR signal
deviation is in fact a point defect. If the length remains the same, then the OTDR signal deviation is a
region of high fiber attenuation. Regions of high fiber attenuation are referred to as attenuation
non-uniformities.
