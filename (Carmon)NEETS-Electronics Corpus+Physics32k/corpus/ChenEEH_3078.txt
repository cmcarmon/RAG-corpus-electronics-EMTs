Transformers are static devices; however, they vibrate due to a
number of causes and because of the radiate sound. There are
two distinct sources of sound: auxiliary cooling equipment
and magnetostriction. The sound produced by the fans and
pumps of a cooling system generally possesses a broadband
frequency spectrum of approximately equal magnitude (white
noise). The major source of a transformer’s audible noise is
caused by the dimensional change of the core laminations
from the variation of ﬂux density in each voltage cycle, referred
to as magnetostriction. The core will radiate noise at the even
harmonics of the voltage (e.g., for a 60-Hz system, the noise
radiates at 120-, 240-, 360-, 480-Hz, and so on). The magni-
tude of this noise is measured by determining the sound-
pressure level given in decibels:
