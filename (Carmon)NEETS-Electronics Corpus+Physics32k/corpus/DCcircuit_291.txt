Keep in mind that these ﬁgures are only approximate, as individuals with different body
chemistry may react differently. It has been suggested that an across-the-chest current of only
17 milliamps AC is enough to induce ﬁbrillation in a human subject under certain conditions.
Most of our data regarding induced ﬁbrillation comes from animal testing. Obviously, it is not
practical to perform tests of induced ventricular ﬁbrillation on human subjects, so the available
data is sketchy. Oh, and in case you’re wondering, I have no idea why women tend to be more
susceptible to electric currents than men!
