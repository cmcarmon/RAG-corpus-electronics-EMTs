loudspeakers are used for all types of audio 
amplification. Most speakers today are constructed 
of a moving coil around a permanent magnet. The 
magnet produces a stationary magnetic field. As 
 current is passed through the coil, it produces a mag-
netic field that varies at the rate of the audio signal. 
The varying magnetic field of the coil is attracted and 
repelled by the magnetic field of the permanent mag-
net. The coil is attached to a cone that moves back 
and forth in response to the audio signal. The cone 
moving back and forth moves the air, reproducing 
the audio sound.
