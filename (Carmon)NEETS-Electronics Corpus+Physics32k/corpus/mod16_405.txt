Grounded circuits are caused by some conducting part of the circuit making contact either directly or
indirectly with the metallic structure of the ship. Grounds can have many causes. The two most common
are the fraying of insulation from a wire and moisture-soaked insulation. The fraying of insulation from a
wire allows bare wire to come into contact with the metal ground. Moisture-soaked insulation causes
reduced insulation resistance (also classified as a ground).
