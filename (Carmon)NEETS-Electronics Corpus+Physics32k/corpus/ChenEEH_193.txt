There is another transfer zero to be removed, s ¼ j2. The
procedure is repeated by ﬁrst evaluating Z3(j2) ¼ 7=j12. It
behaves as a capacitance equal to 7=j12 ¼ 7=jv2C2 ¼ 7=j2C2
with the result C2 ¼ 6=7. The impedance corresponding to the
capacitance has a pole at the origin, and Z3 has the same pole,
so a partial removal of the pole is possible:
