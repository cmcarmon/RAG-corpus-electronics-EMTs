Silicone  ﬂuid  is  used  as  an  alternative  to  mineral  oil.  The  breakdown  strength  of  silicone  liquid  is  over
118 kV/cm  (300  kV/in.)  and  it  has  a  ﬂash  point  of  300(cid:176)C  and  a  ﬁre  point  of  360(cid:176)C.  Silicone-ﬂuid-ﬁlled
transformers are classiﬁed as less ﬂammable. The high dielectric strengths and superior thermal conductivities
of liquid coolants make them ideally suited for large high-voltage power transformers that are used in modern
power generation and distribution.
