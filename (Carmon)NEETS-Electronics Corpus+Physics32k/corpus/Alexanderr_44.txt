2. Present everything you know about the problem. You are now ready
to write down everything you know about the problem and its possible
solutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.
3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success. Almost every problem will
have a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is highly
desirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this point,
you  also  need  to  determine  what  tools  are  available  to  you,  such  as
PSpice and  MATLAB and  other  software  packages  that  can  greatly
reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that time
spent  carefully  deﬁning  the  problem  and  investigating  alternative
approaches  to  its  solution  will  pay  big  dividends  later.  Evaluating  the
alternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood of
success  may  be  difﬁcult  but  will  be  well  worth  the  effort.  Document
this  process  well  since  you  will  want  to  come  back  to  it  if  the  ﬁrst
approach does not work.
