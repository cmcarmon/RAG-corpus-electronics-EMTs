Resistors R2 and R3 are no longer in parallel with each other, because B2 has been inserted
into R3’s branch of the circuit. Upon closer inspection, it appears there are no two resistors
in this circuit directly in series or parallel with each other. This is the crux of our problem:
in series-parallel analysis, we started off by identifying sets of resistors that were directly in
series or parallel with each other, reducing them to single equivalent resistances. If there are
no resistors in a simple series or parallel conﬁguration with each other, then what can we do?
