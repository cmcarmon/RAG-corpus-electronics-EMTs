In the simple case of a plasma with up-down symmetry, the plasma cross-section is defined using a combination of four parameters:
the plasma elongation,



κ
=


b
a




{\displaystyle \kappa ={b \over a}}
, where



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the plasma minor radius, and



b


{\displaystyle b}
is the height of the plasma measured from the equatorial plane,
the plasma triangularity,



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
, defined as the horizontal distance between the plasma major radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
and the X point,
the angle between the horizontal and the plasma last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the low field side,
the angle between the horizontal and the plasma last closed flux surface (LCFS) at the high field side.
In general (no up-down symmetry), there can be an upper-triangularity, and a lower-triangularity.
Tokamaks can have negative triangularity.
