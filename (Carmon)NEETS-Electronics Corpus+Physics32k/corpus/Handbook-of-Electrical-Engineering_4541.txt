Factors Involved in Choosing Basis and Weight Functions
Basis and weight function selection plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and efﬁciency of the resulting
computer  model.  One  goal  of  the  basis  and  weight  function  selection  is  to  minimize  computer  time  while
maximizing accuracy for the problem set to which the model is to be applied. Another, possibly conﬂicting,
goal might be that of maximizing the collection of problem sets to which the model is applicable. A third might
be to replicate the problem’s physical behavior with as few samples as possible. Some of the generic combinations
of bases and weights that are used for MoM models are listed in Table 45.8 [Poggio and Miller from Mittra, 1973].
