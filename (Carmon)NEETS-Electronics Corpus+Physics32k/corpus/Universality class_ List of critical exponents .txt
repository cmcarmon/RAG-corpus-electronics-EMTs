Critical exponents are defined in terms of the variation of certain physical properties of the system near its phase transition point. These physical properties will include its reduced temperature



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
, its order parameter measuring how much of the system is in the "ordered" phase, the specific heat, and so on.
The exponent



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the exponent relating the specific heat C to the reduced temperature: we have



C
=

τ

−
α




{\displaystyle C=\tau ^{-\alpha }}
. The specific heat will usually be singular at the critical point, but the minus sign in the definition of



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
allows it to remain positive.
The exponent



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
relates the order parameter



Ψ


{\displaystyle \Psi }
to the temperature. Unlike most critical exponents it is assumed positive, since the order parameter will usually be zero at the critical point. So we have



Ψ
=

|

τ


|


β




{\displaystyle \Psi =|\tau |^{\beta }}
.
The exponent



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
relates the temperature with the system's response to an external driving force, or source field. We have



d
Ψ

/

d
J
=

τ

−
γ




{\displaystyle d\Psi /dJ=\tau ^{-\gamma }}
, with J the driving force.
The exponent



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
relates the order parameter to the source field at the critical temperature, where this relationship becomes nonlinear. We have



J
=

Ψ

δ




{\displaystyle J=\Psi ^{\delta }}
(hence



Ψ
=

J

1

/

δ




{\displaystyle \Psi =J^{1/\delta }}
), with the same meanings as before.
The exponent



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
relates the size of correlations (ie patches of the ordered phase) to the temperature; away from the critical point these are characterized by a correlation length



ξ


{\displaystyle \xi }
. We have



ξ
=

τ

−
ν




{\displaystyle \xi =\tau ^{-\nu }}
.
The exponent



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
measures the size of correlations at the critical temperature. It is defined so that the correlation function scales as




r

−
d
+
2
−
η




{\displaystyle r^{-d+2-\eta }}
.
