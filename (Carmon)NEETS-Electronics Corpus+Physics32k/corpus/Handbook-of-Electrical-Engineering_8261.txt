A unity gain ampliﬁer with a mode control switch where the input of
the ampliﬁer is connected to a time-varying voltage signal. A trigger pulse at the mode control switch
causes it to read the input at the instance of the trigger and maintain that value until the next trigger pulse.
The ratio between the signal power and the noise power at a point in the signal
