The regenerative detector is used to receive short-wave code signals because it is easy to adjust and
has high sensitivity and good selectivity. At high frequencies, the amount of signal detuning necessary to
produce an audio-beat note is a small percentage of the signal frequency and causes no trouble. The use of
the regenerative detector for low-frequency code reception, however, is usually avoided. At low
frequencies the detuning required to produce the proper audio-beat frequency is a considerable percentage
of the signal frequency. Although this type detector may be used for AM signals, it has high distortion
and is not often used.
