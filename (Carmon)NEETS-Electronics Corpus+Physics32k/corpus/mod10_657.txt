From a practical viewpoint, the doublet antenna can be mounted either vertically or horizontally. The 
doublet shown in figure 4-14 is mounted vertically, and the radiated energy spreads out about the antenna 
in every direction in the horizontal plane. Since ordinarily the horizontal plane is the useful plane, this 
arrangement is termed NONDIRECTIONAL. The directional characteristics of the antenna in other 
planes is ignored. If the doublet were mounted horizontally, it would have the effect of turning the pattern 
on edge, reversing the patterns given in figure 4-14. The antenna would then be directional in the 
horizontal plane. The terms "directional" and "nondirectional" are used for convenience in describing 
specific radiation patterns. A complete description always involves a figure in three dimensions, as in the 
radiation pattern of figure 4-14.
