The frequency response contains a lot of information about the system. It
includes a magnitude plot and a phase plot, both as a function of frequency.
The magnitude of the networkâ€™s transfer function is the ratio of the amplitudes
of the output and the input, and indicates the gain of the system as a function
of frequency. The phase is the angular difference between the output and the
input sinusoids.
