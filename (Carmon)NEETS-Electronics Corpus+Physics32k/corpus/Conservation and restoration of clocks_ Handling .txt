Certain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can deny opportunities for damage to occur:

Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage.
Wearing “[...] cotton or rubber gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock”  can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces.
Pendulum damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement. This can also prevent damage to other interior components.
A clock "[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area"  and moved from one location to the next on its back.
The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.
