the series circuit shown in
Figure 12.14b, which is redrawn in Figure 12.15. To analyze the behavior of this
circuit we can again employ the node method, and this analysis closely parallels
that of Section 12.1. Since a ground node is already selected in Figure 12.15,
and since the unknown node voltages are already labeled as v1 and v2, we may
proceed immediately to Step 3 of node analysis. Here, we write KCL at Nodes
#1 and #2 in terms of v1 and v2. This yields
