As temperature increases, higher energy rotational and vibrational states become accessible to molecular gases, thus increasing the number of degrees of freedom and lowering γ. For a real gas, both CP and CV increase with increasing temperature, while continuing to differ from each other by a fixed constant (as above, CP = CV + nR) which reflects the relatively constant PV difference in work done during expansion, for constant pressure vs. constant volume conditions. Thus, the ratio of the two values, γ, decreases with increasing temperature. For more information on mechanisms for storing heat in gases, see the gas section of specific heat capacity.
