(cid:1) Through our analysis of second-order circuits we observed that their behav-
ior can be very different than the behavior of first-order circuits. Most
importantly, a circuit containing one capacitor and one inductor can exhibit
oscillations that correspond to an exchange of energy between the capaci-
tor and inductor. Not surprisingly, these oscillations were found to decay
in the presence of energy loss (for example, when a resistor is introduced in
the circuit). To characterize this oscillatory behavior we introduced several
key parameters: the undamped natural frequency (or undamped resonance
frequency, or simply resonance frequency)
