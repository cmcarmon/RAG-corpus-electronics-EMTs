The variable resistor can also compensate for changes 
in load current. If the load current increases, more volt-
age drops across the variable resistor, which results in 
less voltage dropped across the load. If the resistance can 
be made to decrease at the same instant that the current 
increases, the voltage dropped across the variable resis-
tor can remain constant, resulting in a constant output 
voltage despite changes in the load current.
