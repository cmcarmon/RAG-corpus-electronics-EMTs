Figure 3-47 shows how the JFET operates in a zero gate bias condition. Five volts are applied across 
the JFET so that current flows through the bar from source to drain, as indicated by the arrow. The gate 
terminal is tied to ground. This is a zero gate bias condition. In this condition, a typical bar represents a 
resistance of about 500 ohms. A milliammeter, connected in series with the drain lead and dc power, 
indicates the amount of current flow. With a drain supply (VDD) of 5 volts, the milliammeter gives a drain 
current (ID) reading of 10 milliamperes. The voltage and current subscript letters (V DD, ID) used for an 
FET correspond to the elements of the FET just as they do for the elements of transistors.
