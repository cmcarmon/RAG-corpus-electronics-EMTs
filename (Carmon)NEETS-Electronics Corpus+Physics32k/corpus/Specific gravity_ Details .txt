Being a ratio of densities, specific gravity is a dimensionless quantity. The reason for the specific gravity being dimensionless is to provide a global consistency between the U.S. and Metric Systems, since various units for density may be used such as pounds per cubic feet or grams per cubic centimeter, etc. Specific gravity varies with temperature and pressure; reference and sample must be compared at the same temperature and pressure or be corrected to a standard reference temperature and pressure. Substances with a specific gravity of 1 are neutrally buoyant in water. Those with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding surface tension effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.
True specific gravity can be expressed mathematically as:




S

G

ρ

sample



ρ



H

O







{\displaystyle SG_{\text{true}}={\frac {\rho _{\text{sample}}}{\rho _{\rm {H_{2}O}}}}}

where




ρ

sample





{\displaystyle \rho _{\text{sample}}\,}
is the density of the sample and




ρ



H

2


O





{\displaystyle \rho _{\rm {H_{2}O}}}
is the density of water.
The apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:




S

O









{\displaystyle SG_{\text{apparent}}={\frac {W_{A_{\text{sample}}}}{W_{A_{\rm {H_{2}O}}}}}}

where




W

{\displaystyle W_{A_{\text{sample}}}}
represents the weight of sample and




W


A



H

O







{\displaystyle W_{A_{\rm {H_{2}O}}}}
the weight of water, both measured in air.
It can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:

where



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the local acceleration due to gravity,



V


{\displaystyle V}
is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both),





ρ

{\displaystyle {\rho _{\text{sample}}}}
is the density of the sample,




ρ



H

O





{\displaystyle \rho _{\rm {H_{2}O}}}
is the density of water and

{\displaystyle W_{V}}
represents a weight obtained in vacuum.
The density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (1013.25 mbar ± variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (in vacuo) specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation

{\displaystyle (T_{\text{s}}/T_{\text{r}})}
with




T

s




{\displaystyle T_{\text{s}}}
representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and




T

r




{\displaystyle T_{\text{r}}}
the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20°C/4°C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20°C and of the water at 4°C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while

{\displaystyle SG_{\rm {H_{2}O}}=0.998203/0.999840=0.998363}
(20°C/4°C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current ITS-90 scale and the densities used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale, the densities at 20 °C and 4 °C are 0.9982071 and 0.9999720 respectively, resulting in an SG (20°C/4°C) value for water of 0.9982343.
As the principal use of specific gravity measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and as these are found in tables of SG vs concentration, it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of specific gravity. For example, in the brewing industry, the Plato table lists sucrose concentration by weight against true SG, and was originally (20°C/4°C) i.e. based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20 °C) but referenced to the density of water at 4 °C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density

{\displaystyle \rho _{\rm {H_{2}O}}}
equal to 0.999972 g·cm−3 in SI units (or 62.43 lb·ft−3 in United States customary units). The ASBC table in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent specific gravity measurements at (20°C/20°C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is 0.9982071 g·cm−3. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by A. Brix which uses SG (17.5°C/17.5°C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60F and are thus (15.56°C/15.56°C).
Given the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:

{\displaystyle {\rho _{\text{substance}}}=SG\times \rho _{\rm {H_{2}O}}.}

Occasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.
