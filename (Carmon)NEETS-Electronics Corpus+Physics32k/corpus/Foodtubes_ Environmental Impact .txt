A large amount of air pollution in the world is caused by carbon dioxide emissions from cars. Many of these emissions come from large freight trucks carrying food and other cargo. If installed on a large scale in the UK, Foodtubes would reduce carbon dioxide levels added to the atmosphere by 8%, and save 17 billion liters of diesel per year. According to estimations by the company, in large towns such as Croydon, London, the project would save 90% of fuel and energy. Presently, 92% of energy for moving freight is used to move the vehicle, and only 8% used to transport the cargo itself. A more efficient system such as Foodtubes would save both energy and money by saving fuel and time spent transporting food in traffic.
