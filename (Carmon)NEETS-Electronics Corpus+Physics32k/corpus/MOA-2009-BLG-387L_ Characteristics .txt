MOA-2009-BLG-387L is an M-type red dwarf in the Sagittarius constellation. It is estimated to be 5700 parsecs (18,591 light years) away, although uncertainty has led the discovering team to place the confidence intervals at ± 2200 parsecs (7,176 light years); in other words, although the distance of MOA-2009-BLG-387L from Earth is best placed at 5700 parsecs, astronomers can only be 90% certain that it is somewhere between 3,500 and 7,900 parsecs away. Likewise, although MOA-2009-BLG-387L's mass has been estimated at 0.19 times that of the Sun, the confidence intervals remain large (+0.3−0.12), as uncertainty in the mass of the planet places its true mass between 0.07 and 0.49 times the mass of the Sun. This covers the entirety of the range of masses known in red dwarfs.
The ratio between planet MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb's mass to that of its host star has been found with accuracy. However, because the host star's characteristics are not as well-constrained, the planet's characteristics are not well-constrained either. The inability to constrain many of MOA-2009-BLG-387L's characteristics is a consequence of the fact that the star acted as the lens in the microlensing event, which compromised the ability to collect most of the star's stellar parameters.
