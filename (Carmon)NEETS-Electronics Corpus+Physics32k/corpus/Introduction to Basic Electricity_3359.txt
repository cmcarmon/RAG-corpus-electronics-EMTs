TRIACs have disadvantages when compared to SCRs. 
TRIACs have current ratings as high as 25  amperes, 
but SCRs are available with current ratings as high as 
1400 amperes. A TRIAC’s maximum voltage rating is 
500 volts, compared to an SCR’s 2600 volts. TRIACs are 
designed for low frequency (50 to 400 hertz), whereas 
SCRs can handle up to 30,000 hertz. TRIACs also have 
difficulty switching power to inductive loads.
