If the terminal strip uses machine screws to hold the component and wire ends, nothing
but a screwdriver is needed to secure new connections or break old connections. Some termi-
nal strips use spring-loaded clips – similar to a breadboard’s except for increased ruggedness
– engaged and disengaged using a screwdriver as a push tool (no twisting involved). The elec-
trical connections established by a terminal strip are quite robust, and are considered suitable
for both permanent and temporary construction.
