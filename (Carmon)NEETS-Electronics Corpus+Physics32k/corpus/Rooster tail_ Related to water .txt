A fast current of water flowing over a rock near the surface of a stream or river can create a rooster tail—such commotion at the water's surface are avoided by boaters due to the near surface obstruction. Propellers on boats can produce a rooster tail of water in their wake, in the form of a fountain which shoots into the air behind the boat. The faster a boat goes, the larger the rooster tails become. The efficiency of a boat's hull design can be determined by the magnitude of the rooster tail—larger rooster tails indicate less efficient designs. If a water skier is in tow, the skis also throw off a rooster tail. Airplanes lifting off from a lake produce lengthening rooster tails behind their amphibious floats with speed until the plane lifts off the surface.
