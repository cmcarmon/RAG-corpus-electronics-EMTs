Since us by deÔ¨Ånition lies between 0 and p=2, cos us is positive.
Therefore, the two roots of the characteristic equation 7.76
have negative real parts, and the equilibrium (us, vs)T is small-
signal stable. Therefore, the system will return to the equilib-
rium condition following any small perturbations away from
this equilibrium point. On the other hand, when the equilib-
rium point (uu, vs)T is considered, note that cos uu is negative
because uu lies between p=2 and p. Then, the characteristic
equation 7.76 will have one positive real eigenvalue and one
negative real eigenvalue when us is replaced by uu. Therefore,
the equilibrium (uu, vs)T is small-signal unstable.
