The mass of an unstable particle is formally a complex number, with the real part being its mass in the usual sense, and the imaginary part being its decay rate in natural units. When the imaginary part is large compared to the real part, the particle is usually thought of as a resonance more than a particle. This is because in quantum field theory a particle of mass M (a real number) is often exchanged between two other particles when there is not enough energy to create it, if the time to travel between these other particles is short enough, of order 1/M, according to the uncertainty principle. For a particle of mass

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle M+i\Gamma }
, the particle can travel for time 1/M, but decays after time of order of

Γ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle 1/\Gamma }
. If

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \Gamma >M}
then the particle usually decays before it completes its travel.
