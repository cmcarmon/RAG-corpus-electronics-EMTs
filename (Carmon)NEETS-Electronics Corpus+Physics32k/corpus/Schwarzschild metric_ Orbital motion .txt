A particle orbiting in the Schwarzschild metric can have a stable circular orbit with r > 3rs. Circular orbits with r between 1.5rs and 3rs are unstable, and no circular orbits exist for r < 1.5rs. The circular orbit of minimum radius 1.5rs corresponds to an orbital velocity approaching the speed of light. It is possible for a particle to have a constant value of r between rs and 1.5rs, but only if some force acts to keep it there.
Noncircular orbits, such as Mercury's, dwell longer at small radii than would be expected classically. This can be seen as a less extreme version of the more dramatic case in which a particle passes through the event horizon and dwells inside it forever. Intermediate between the case of Mercury and the case of an object falling past the event horizon, there are exotic possibilities such as knife-edge orbits, in which the satellite can be made to execute an arbitrarily large number of nearly circular orbits, after which it flies back outward.
