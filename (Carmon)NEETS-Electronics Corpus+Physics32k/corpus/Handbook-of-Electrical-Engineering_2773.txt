Sea-of-Gates ASIC Technology
The sea-of-gates technology also uses premanufactured, noncustomized gate arrays. However, additional met-
allization layers are provided, with lower-level metallization layer(s) used to program the internal function of
the cells and the upper-level layer(s) used for over-the-cell routing [Sherwani et al., 95] of signals among cells,
such as illustrated earlier in Fig. 25.30(b). This eliminates the need for wiring channels and feedthrough cells,
leading to denser arrays of transistors.
