An obsolete name for a capacitor is condenser or condensor. These terms are not used in
any new books or schematic diagrams (to my knowledge), but they might be encountered in
older electronics literature. Perhaps the most well-known usage for the term ”condenser” is
in automotive engineering, where a small capacitor called by that name was used to mitigate
excessive sparking across the switch contacts (called ”points”) in electromechanical ignition
systems.
