The design of the controller itself is an important factor, and proper tuning of the controller parameters is
needed to obtain “good” control without “excessive” movement of units. Tuning is system-speciﬁc, and although
system  simulations  are  often  used  as  aids,  most  of  the  parameter  adjustments  are  made  in  the  ﬁeld  using
heuristic procedures.
