When considering protection of the most common power
system components, namely generators, power transformers,
transmission lines, busses, and motors, only a few basic
relaying principles are used. They include overcurrent, dis-
tance, directional, and differential. In the case of transmission
line relaying, communication channels may also be used to
provide exchange of information between relays located at two
ends of the line. The following discussion is aimed at explain-
ing the generic properties of the above-mentioned relaying
principles. Many other relaying principles are also in use
today. The details may be found in a number of excellent
references on the subject (Horowitz and Phadke, 1992; Black-
burn, 1998; Ungrad et al., 1995; Blackburn, 1993).
