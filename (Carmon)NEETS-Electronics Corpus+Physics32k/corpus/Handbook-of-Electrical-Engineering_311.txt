The third method may also be used when controlled sources are present within the network. A test voltage
may be placed across the terminals with a resulting current calculated or measured. Alternatively, a test current
may be injected into the terminals with a resulting voltage determined. In either case, the equivalent resistance
can be obtained from the value of the ratio of the test voltage
