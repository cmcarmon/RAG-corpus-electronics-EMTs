When a circuit has more than two energy-storing elements, say
n, the analysis of the circuit in general results in a differential
equation of order n. The solution of such an equation follows
steps similar to the second-order case. The characteristic equa-
tion will be of degree n and will have n roots. The natural
response will have n exponential terms. Also, the forced
response will in general have the same shape as the forcing
function. The Laplace transform is normally used to solve such
higher order circuits.
