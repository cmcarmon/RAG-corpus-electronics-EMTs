Superconducting materials also interact in interesting ways with magnetic ﬁelds. While in
the superconducting state, a superconducting material will tend to exclude all magnetic ﬁelds,
a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. However, if the magnetic ﬁeld strength intensiﬁes
beyond a critical level, the superconducting material will be rendered non-superconductive. In
other words, superconducting materials will lose their superconductivity (no matter how cold
you make them) if exposed to too strong of a magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, the presence of any mag-
netic ﬁeld tends to lower the critical temperature of any superconducting material: the more
magnetic ﬁeld present, the colder you have to make the material before it will superconduct.
