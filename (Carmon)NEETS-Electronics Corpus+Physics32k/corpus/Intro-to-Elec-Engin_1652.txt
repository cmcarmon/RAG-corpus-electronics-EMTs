• Maximum (or peak) overshoot A is the largest deviation of the output over the step input
during the transient state. It is used as a measure of the relative stability of the system. The
percentage maximum overshoot is given by the ratio of maximum overshoot to ﬁnal value,
expressed in percent.
• Delay time td is deﬁned as the time required for the step response to reach 90% of its ﬁnal
value.
• Rise time tr is deﬁned as the time needed for the step response to rise from 10% to 90% of
its ﬁnal value.
