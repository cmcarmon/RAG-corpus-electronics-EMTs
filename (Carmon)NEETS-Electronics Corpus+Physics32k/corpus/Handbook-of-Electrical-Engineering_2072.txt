Why Exploit Sound for Underwater Applications?
It has been found that acoustic energy propagates better under water than other types of energy. For example, both
light and radio waves (used for satellite or above-ground communications) are attenuated to a far greater degree
under water than are sound waves. For this reason sound waves have generally been used to extract information
about underwater objects. A typical underwater acoustical signal processing scenario is shown in Fig. 19.8.
