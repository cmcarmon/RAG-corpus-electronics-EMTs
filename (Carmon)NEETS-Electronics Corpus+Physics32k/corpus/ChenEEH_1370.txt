Counters and timers allow precise information to be made
available by inserting extra code to count the number of times
a portion of source code has been executed or how long is
spent executing it. Counters require manual user insertion of
codes or special compiler action. They have the advantage of
revealing precise information, unlike sampling techniques;
however, timers can be complex, and the presence of the
counter or timer may itself interfere with the result that is
trying to be measured to some extent.
