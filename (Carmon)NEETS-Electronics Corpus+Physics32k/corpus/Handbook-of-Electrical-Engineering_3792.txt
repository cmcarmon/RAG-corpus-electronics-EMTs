Transverse-electric modes, sometimes called H modes. These modes have Ez = 0 at all points
within the waveguide, which means that the electric ﬁeld vector is always perpendicular (i.e.,
transverse)  to  the  waveguide  axis.  These  modes  are  always  possible  in  waveguides  with
uniform dielectrics.
Transverse-magnetic  modes,  sometimes  called  E  modes.  These  modes  have  Hz  =  0  at  all
points within the waveguide, which means that the magnetic ﬁeld vector is perpendicular
to the waveguide axis. Like TE modes, they are always possible in waveguides with uniform
dielectrics.
EH modes are hybrid modes in which neither Ez nor Hz are zero, but the characteristics of
the transverse ﬁelds are controlled more by Ez than Hz. These modes are often possible in
waveguides with inhomogeneous dielectrics.
HE modes are hybrid modes in which neither Ez nor Hz are zero, but the characteristics of
the  transverse  ﬁelds  are  controlled  more  by  Hz  than  E z.  Like  EH  modes,  these  modes  are
often possible in waveguides with inhomogeneous dielectrics.
