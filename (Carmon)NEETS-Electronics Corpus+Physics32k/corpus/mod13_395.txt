The counter operates as a normal counter until it reaches a count of 10102, or 1010. At that time, both
inputs to the NAND gate are HIGH, and the output goes LOW. This LOW applied to the CLR input of
the FFs causes them to reset to 0. Remember from the discussion of J-K FFs that CLR and PS or PR
override any existing condition of the FF. Once the FFs are reset, the count may begin again. The
following table shows the binary count and the inputs and outputs of the NAND gate for each count of the
decade counter:
