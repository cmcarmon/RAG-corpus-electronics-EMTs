so the ripple has been reduced relative to the DC by a factor of about 1.7. This level
of reduction is not particularly exciting. As can be seen from Equation 4.81, we can
improve the level of reduction by reducing the value of rd. One way to do so is to
replace the nonlinear resistor of this example with one whose v i curve has a steeper
slope as seen in the next example.
