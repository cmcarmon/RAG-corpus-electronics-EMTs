The impact of DIBL on VT can be measured by plotting the
subthreshold characteristics for increasing values of VDS as
shown in Figure 3.16. The subthreshold slope degrades and
the impact of drain bias on DVT increases as the channel
length is reduced. This methodology is valid only until the
subthreshold slope remains intact. A very large subthreshold
swing implies that the device cannot be turned off. This phe-
nomenon is called punchthrough and occurs roughly when
the source and drain depletion regions meet. Since the deple-
tion region becomes wider at larger drain biases, the onset of
punchthrough is reached sooner. Punchthrough can occur
