(cid:1) The Op Amp is a four-ported device. The ports include an input port
with terminals usually labeled v
, an output port with one terminal
labeled vo, and the other being ground, a positive power supply port with a
+VS voltage applied with respect to ground, and a negative power supply
port with a âˆ’VS voltage applied with respect to ground. Although the
ground terminal is not explicitly shown in the Op Amp symbol, it is very
much a part of all Op Amp circuits.
