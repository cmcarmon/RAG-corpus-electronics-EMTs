Motion Estimation Techniques
Frame-to-frame  changes  in  luminance  are  generated  when  objects  move  in  video  sequences. The  luminance
changes can be used to estimate the displacement of the moving objects if an appropriate model of the motion
is speciﬁed. A variety of motion models have been developed for dynamic scene analysis in machine vision and
for video communications applications. In fact, motion estimates were ﬁrst used as a control mechanism for
the efﬁcient coding of a sequence of images in an effort to reduce the temporal redundancy. Motion estimation
algorithms can be classiﬁed in two broad categories: gradient or differential-based methods and token matching
or correspondence methods. The gradient methods can be further divided into pel recursive, block matching,
and optical ﬂow methods.
