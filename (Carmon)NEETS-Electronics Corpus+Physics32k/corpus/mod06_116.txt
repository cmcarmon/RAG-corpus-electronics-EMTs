Assume that table 1-2 shows our results. While we could use the table, a more normal procedure is to
plot a graph of the values. Such a graph is called an Ep - Ip CURVE and is shown in figure 1-13. Each
tube has its own Ep - Ip curve, which is available in commercial tube manuals and in many equipment
technical manuals. Each curve will be different in some respects from every other curve. The shapes,
however, will be similar.
