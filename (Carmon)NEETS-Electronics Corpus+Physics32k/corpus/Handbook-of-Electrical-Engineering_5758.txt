3. A voltage control area is the bifurcation subsystem (agent) for clogging voltage instability. The agent is
vulnerable to voltage instability for loss of generation in the agent, line outage in the agent boundary,
or  increased  real  and  reactive  ﬂow  across  the  agent  boundary  based  on  analysis  of  the  lower  bound
approximation of the eigenvalue associated with that agent. The cure for clogging voltage instability in
this agent is to reduce the real and reactive ﬂow across the boundary of the agent [Schlueter, 1998b; f].
4. A voltage control area and its associated reactive reserve basin are the bifurcation subsystem (agent) for
loss of control voltage instability. The agent is vulnerable to voltage instability for loss of generation in
the agent, line outages, transfer or wheeling transactions that reduce reactive reserve basin reserves based
on analysis of the lower bound approximation of the eigenvalue associated with that agent. The cure for
voltage  instability  in  the  agent  is  to  add  reactive  reserves  on  the  reactive  reserve  basin  via  capacitor
insertion, generator voltage setpoint changes on reactive reserve basin generators, or reverse tap position
changes on underload tap changers [Schlueter, 1998b; f].
