Example 3.13 
 
A circuit 
train  of 
alternating  positive  and  negative  pulses  of  short 
duration  from  a  square  wave  of  frequency  1  kHz. 
Devise  a  suitable  Câ€“R  circuit  and  specify  suitable 
values. 
 
Solution 
 
Here  we  require  the  services  of  a  differentiating 
circuit along the lines of that shown in Fig. 3.35. In 
order  that  the  circuit  operates  effectively  as  a
