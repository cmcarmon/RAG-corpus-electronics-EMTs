The total response of a system to an excitation that is suddenly applied or changed consists of
the sum of the steady-state and transient responses, or of natural and forced responses. The
forced response is the component of the system response that is due to the applied excitation.
The transition from the response prior to the change in excitation to the response produced by the
excitation is indicated by the natural (transient) response, which is characteristic of all systems
containing energy-storage components.
