The voltage supplied to each customer should be within the 
5% limit, which, at 120 V, corresponds to 114
and 126-V. Figure 65.6 shows a typical voltage proﬁle for a feeder at light and heavy load conditions. The ﬁgure
shows that at heavy load, the voltage at the end of the line will be less than the allowable minimum voltage.
However, at the light load condition the voltage supplied to each customer will be within the allowable limit.
Calculation of the voltage proﬁle, voltage drop, and feeder loss is one of the major tasks in distribution system
design. The concept of voltage drop and loss calculation is demonstrated using the feeder shown in Fig. 65.6.
To calculate the voltage drop, the feeder is divided into sections. The sections are determined by the loads.
