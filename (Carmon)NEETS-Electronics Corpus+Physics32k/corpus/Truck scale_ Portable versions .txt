Portable truck scales can also be found in use around the world. A portable truck scale will have lower frame work that can be placed on non-typical surfaces such as dirt. These scales retain the same level of accuracy as a pit-type scale, with accuracy of up to + or - 1%. The first portable truck scale record in the US was units operated by the Weight Patrol of the Los Angeles Motor Patrol in 1929. Four such weighing units were used with one under each of the trucks wheels. Each unit could record up to 15,000 pounds (6,800 kg).
