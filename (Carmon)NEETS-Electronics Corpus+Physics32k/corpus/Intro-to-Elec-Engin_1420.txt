(+z-direction). The radiation pattern, with linear polarization, exhibits a principal lobe in the
+z-direction. The other elements, called directors, are designed to enhance radiation in the +z
direction. Gain increases with the number of elements and is often in the range of 10 to 20 dB.
The bandwidth is usually small.
