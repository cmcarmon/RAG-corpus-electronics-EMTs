although necessary for completeness, did not add any new insight about
the circuit behavior. For example, the same information about the form of
vc in the steady state, or its value at low frequencies and high frequencies
could have been found from Equation 13.17, or even from the complex
amplitude Vc, Equation 13.16, just as easily as from Equation 13.21,
without the intervening ‘‘real part’’ calculation.2
For example, the steady state value of vc (or the particular or forced
response) can be determined from the value of Vc as
