It is also desirable to have an estimate of the input imped-
ance of the antenna. The simplest way for estimating this is the
transmission line model for the patch antenna. In this case, the
antenna is modeled as two radiating slots of width Dloc and
length a separated by a microstrip transmission line with
dimensions corresponding to the dimensions of the patch
antenna. Note that the feeding can be placed at one end of
the antenna or at some point a distance x inside the patch,
either by the use of an inset feed or a coaxial probe. The
equivalent structure for interior feeding is shown in Figure
11.16. At resonance, the impedance of the radiating slot will
be pure real. To Ô¨Årst-order for a  l0 (which will be true on
high-permittivity substrates), the radiation resistance of each
slot may be approximated as:
