A battery is a voltage source that uses chemical action to produce a voltage. In many cases the term 
battery is applied to a single cell, such as the flashlight battery. In the case of a flashlight that uses a 
battery of 1.5 volts, the battery is a single cell. The flashlight that is operated by 6 volts uses four cells in 
a single case and this is a battery composed of more than one cell. There are three ways to combine cells 
to form a battery.
