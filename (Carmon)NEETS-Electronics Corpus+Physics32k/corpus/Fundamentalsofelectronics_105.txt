Current ﬂows through circuit elements, such as that depicted in Figure 3.1, and through conductors,
which we indicate by lines in circuit diagrams. For every circuit element we deﬁne a voltage and a current.
The element has a v-i relation deﬁned by the element’s physical properties. In deﬁning the v-i relation, we
have the convention that positive current ﬂows from positive to negative voltage drop. Voltage has units of
volts, and both the unit and the quantity are named for Alessandro Volta2. Current has units of amperes,
and is named for the French physicist André-Marie Ampère3.
