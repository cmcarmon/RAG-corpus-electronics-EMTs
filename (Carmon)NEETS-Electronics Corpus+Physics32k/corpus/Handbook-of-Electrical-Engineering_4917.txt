It should be noted that the temperature dependencies given in Equations (53.10) and (53.11) are not precisely
  materials.  It  has  been  suggested  that  this  is  because  the  angular  momentum  of  the

electrons forming a Cooper pair in high-
two-ï¬‚uid picture of transport and its associated constitutive law, Eq. (53.12), are still valid for high-Tc  super-
conductors.
