1. When two accesses to the same array occur in parallel, it
means there is a self-conﬂict, a loop in the conﬂict
graph. Such a self-conﬂict forces a two-ported memory
in the memory architecture. Two-ported and multi-
ported memories are much more costly; therefore self-
conﬂicts carry a very heavy weight in the cost function.
2. In the absence of self-conﬂicts, the conﬂict graph’s
chromatic number indicates the minimal number of
single-port memories required to provide the necessary
bandwidth. For example, in Figure 2.22, the chromatic
number of the graph is three: A, B, and C need three
different colors to color the graph, for example. That
means also a minimum of three single-port memories
are required, even though three accesses never occur in
parallel. More memories make the design (potentially)
more costly; therefore, the conﬂict graph’s chromatic
number is the second component of the cost.
