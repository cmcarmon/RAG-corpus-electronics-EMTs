Step 3: The total resistance included in the armature circuit is 0.78  at the beginning of this
step. The initial motor speed is 399.6 r/min, and the counter emf is 172.28 V. The initial armature
current is then (230 − 172.28)/0.78 = 57.72/0.78 = 74 A. With the ﬁnal current at 37 A, the
counter emf is
