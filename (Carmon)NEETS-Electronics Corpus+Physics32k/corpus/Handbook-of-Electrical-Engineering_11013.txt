Contraction of Skeletal Muscle
The functional unit of the muscular system is the motor unit, consisting of a nerve cell located within the spinal
cord, its axon (nerve ﬁber), and the group of muscle ﬁbers that it innervates, as shown in Fig. 113.17. Between
the nerve ﬁber and the muscle ﬁbers is the myoneural junction, the site where acetylcholine is liberated and
transmits excitation to the muscle ﬁbers. The number of muscle ﬁbers per nerve ﬁber is called the innervation
ratio, which ranges from 1:1 to about 1000:1; the former ratio is characteristic of the extraocular muscles, and
the latter is typical for the postural muscles.
