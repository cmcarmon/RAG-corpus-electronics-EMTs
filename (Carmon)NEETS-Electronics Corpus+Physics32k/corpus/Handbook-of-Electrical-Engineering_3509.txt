 
The  ﬁeld  of
(CAD)  or
computer-aided  engineering
  (CAE),  involves  developing  computer  programs  to  conduct  portions  of  product
design and manufacturing on behalf of the designer. Competitive pressures to produce more efﬁciently new
generations of products having improved function and performance are motivating the growing importance
of DA. The increasing complexities of microelectronic technology, shown in Fig. 34.1, illustrate the importance
of relegating portions of product development to computer automation [Barbe, 1980].
