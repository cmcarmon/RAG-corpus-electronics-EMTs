CELP
The general CELP architecture is described as a blockwise analysis-by-synthesis selection of an LPC excitation
sequence. In low-rate CELP coders, a forward-adaptive linear predictive analysis is performed at 20 to 30 msec
intervals.  The  gross  spectral  characterization  is  used  to  reconstruct,  via  linear  prediction,  candidate  speech
segments derived from a constrained set of plausible ﬁlter excitations (the “codebook”). The excitation vector
that produces the synthetic speech segment with smallest perceptually weighted distortion (with respect to the
original speech) is chosen for transmission. Typically, the excitation vector is optimized more often than the

The use of perceptual weighting in the CELP reconstruction stage and analysis-by-synthesis optimization of
the dominant low-frequency (pitch) component are key concepts in maintaining good quality encoded speech
at lower rates. CELP-based speech coders are the predominant coding methodologies for rates between 4 kbits/s
and 16 kbits/s due to their excellent subjective performance. Some of the most notable are detailed below.
