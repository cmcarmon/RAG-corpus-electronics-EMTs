 If the shape of the conductor is changed to form a loop, then the electromagnetic field around each 
portion of the conductor cuts across some other portion of the same conductor. This is shown in its 
simplest form in figure 2-2. A length of conductor is looped so that two portions of the conductor lie next 
to each other. These portions are labeled conductor 1 and conductor 2. When the switch is closed, current 
(electron flow) in the conductor produces a magnetic field around ALL portions of the conductor. For 
simplicity, the magnetic field (expanding lines of flux) is shown in a single plane that is perpendicular to 
both conductors. Although the expanding field of flux originates at the same time in both conductors, it is 
considered as originating in conductor 1 and its effect on conductor 2 will be explained. With increasing 
current, the flux field expands outward from conductor 1, cutting across a portion of conductor 2. This 
results in an induced emf in conductor 2 as shown by the dashed arrow. Note that the induced emf is in 
the opposite direction to (in OPPOSITION to) the battery current and voltage, as stated in Lenz's law.
