Any rapidly spinning object—a top, a wheel, an airplane propeller, or a spinning projectile—is 
fundamentally a gyroscope. Strictly speaking, however, a gyroscope is a mechanical device containing a 
spinning mass that is universally mounted; that is, mounted so it can assume any position in space. Figure 
3-1 shows a model of a gyro. As you can see, a heavy wheel (rotor) is mounted so that its spin axis is free 
to turn in any direction. The wheel spins about axis X; it can turn about axis Y, and it can turn about axis 
Z. With this mechanical arrangement, the spinning wheel can assume any position in space.
