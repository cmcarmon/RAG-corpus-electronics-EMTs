The instrument can be used as either a transmission type or an absorption type of wavemeter. When 
used as a transmission wavemeter, the unknown signal is coupled into the circuit by means of input A. 
When the cavity is tuned to the resonant frequency of the signal, energy is coupled through coupling loop 
B into the cavity and out through loop C to the crystal rectifier where it is rectified and indicated on the 
meter. At frequencies off resonance little or no current flows in the detector and the meter reading is 
small. Therefore, the micrometer and attached plunger are varied until a maximum meter reading is 
obtained. The micrometer setting is then compared with a calibration chart supplied with the wavemeter 
to determine the unknown frequency.
