14.1.14 Three alternative ways of representing a real peri-
odic signal x(t) in terms of Fourier-series expan-
sion are given in Problem 14.1.3. Determine the
expansion coefﬁcients xn of each of the periodic
signals shown in Figure P14.1.14, and for each
signal also determine the trigonometric Fourier-
series coefﬁcients an and bn.
