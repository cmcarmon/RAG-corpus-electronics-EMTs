others,	especially	the	novices	in	circuit	engineering,	to	believe	that	they	are	one
and	the	same.	In	a	way,	since	they	are	both	presentations	of	a	circuitâ€™s	system,	they
may	seem	similar.	However,	upon	closer	inspection,	they	are	not.	It	is,	therefore,
essential	in	the	circuit	design	process	that	the	difference	is	acknowledged.
A	PCB	layout	is	a	physical	representation	or	a	real	model	of	a	circuit.	It	presents
all	of	the	electrical	components	that	are	included;	it	also	details	which	of	the
components	are	active	and	which	ones	are	passive.	Although	it	can	show	an	actual
working	circuit,	understanding	the	functions	of	each	of	its	parts	can	be	tedious.
