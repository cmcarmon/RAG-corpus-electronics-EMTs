the stubs. The other example is a simple microstrip line
coupled with a series of dielectric resonators that observe the
similar operating mechanism. On the other hand, a periodic
structure is used that exhibits alternated pass and stopbands.
The stopband is called bandgap in quantum physics and optics
for periodic patterned structures or simply bandgap structures.
