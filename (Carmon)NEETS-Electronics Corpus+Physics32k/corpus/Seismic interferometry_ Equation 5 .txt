Ф(A,B)≈Re^iω(λArλrB)
This form is equivalent to a virtual source configuration at a location A imaging hypothetical reflections at a location B. Migration of these correlation positions removes the phase term and yields a final migration image at position x where:
m(x) = Σø(A,B,λAx+λxB) Where: ø(A,B,t) = temporal correlation between locations A and B with lag time t
This model has been applied to simulate subsurface geometry in West Texas using simulated models including a traditional buried source and a synthetic (virtual) rotating drill bit source to produce similar results. A similar model demonstrated the reconstruction of a simulated subsurface geometry. In this case, the reconstructed subsurface response correctly modeled the relative positions of primaries and multiples. Additional equations can be derived to reconstruct signal geometries in a wide variety of cases.
