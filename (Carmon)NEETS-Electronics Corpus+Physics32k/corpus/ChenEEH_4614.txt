for failure diagnosis.
The smaller threshold value gives more restriction in
failure recognition and thus provides a more conserva-
tive diagnostic result. It also implies that more com-
putational cost may possibly be spent due to the
conservative attitude. On the other hand, if the value
appears to be too big, large uncertainty may exist in the
diagnostic result. Thus, the control actions may switch
among nominal controller, postfailure control actions,
and intelligent control regulator. The best design of
these parameters
should be on system-dependent
bases.
