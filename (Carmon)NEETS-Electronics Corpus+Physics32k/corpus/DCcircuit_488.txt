An interesting rule for total power versus individual power is that it is additive for any
conﬁguration of circuit: series, parallel, series/parallel, or otherwise. Power is a measure of
rate of work, and since power dissipated must equal the total power applied by the source(s)
(as per the Law of Conservation of Energy in physics), circuit conﬁguration has no effect on the
mathematics.
