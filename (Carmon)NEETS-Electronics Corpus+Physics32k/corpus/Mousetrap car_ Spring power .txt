A mousetrap is powered by a helical torsion spring. Torsion springs obey an angular form of Hooke's law:




τ
=
−
κ
θ



{\displaystyle \tau =-\kappa \theta \,}

where



τ



{\displaystyle \tau \,}
is the torque exerted by the spring in newton-meters, and



θ



{\displaystyle \theta \,}
is the angle of twist from its equilibrium position in radians.



κ



{\displaystyle \kappa \,}
is a constant with units of newton-meters / radian, variously called the spring's torsion coefficient, torsion elastic modulus, or just spring constant, equal to the torque required to twist the spring through an angle of 1 radian. It is analogous to the spring constant of a linear spring.
The energy of U, in joules, stored in a torsion spring is:




U

{\displaystyle U={\frac {1}{2}}\kappa \theta ^{2}}

When a mousetrap is assembled, the spring is initially twisted beyond its equilibrium position so that it applies significant torque to the bar when the trap is closed.
