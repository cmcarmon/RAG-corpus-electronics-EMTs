This PLA has three inputs, ﬁve product terms, and two outputs. Each input is fed into the ﬁrst array, the
AND array, in true and complement form. This enables any product to be formed. The products are all fed
into  the  OR  array. A  cross  at  an  intersection  indicates  a  connection.  Notice  that  some  products  are  used  to
contribute to both outputs. The ability to share product terms in this way is an important feature of the PLA.
The product terms which make up the inputs to the OR gate for the SUM output are those given in Eq. (81.14).
The  equation  for  the  CARRY  output  has  been  modiﬁed  for  use  in  this  PLA  which  also  has  programmable
output inversions, indicated by the two exclusive-OR gates. The modiﬁed equation for the inverse of CARRY,
which now shares some products with the ﬁrst function, is
