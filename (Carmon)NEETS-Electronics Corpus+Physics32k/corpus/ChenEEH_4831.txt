Complex control systems often have multiple processors that
must be interconnected through a communication network.
All communication networks have protocols that are the spec-
iﬁcations (or rules) by which the data is transferred. Most
common model for data networks is the open systems inter-
connection (OSI) model (Tanenbaum, 1996), which has seven
layers of protocols: the physical layer (the hardware that
actually transmits and receives the data) at the bottom and
the application layer (the software level that accesses mail and
does FTP functions) at the top. In between are the layers that
check for errors, perform routing (such as IP) tasks, create
rules for providing a reliable connection including breaking
information into packets (such as TCP), and handle collisions
of packets (such as CSMA/CD). Typical data networks, such as
ethernet, send packets of information in a nondeterministic or
‘‘bursty’’ manner. The desire to have a more deterministic,
steady stream of information in applications such as voice
and video transmission prompted the design of the asyn-
chronous transfer mode (ATM) model, which is an alternative
to the OSI model and has the potential for good applicability
to networked control systems.
