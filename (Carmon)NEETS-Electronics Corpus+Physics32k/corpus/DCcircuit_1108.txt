Since we live in an imperfect world, with imperfect batteries, we need to understand the
implications of factors such as internal resistance. Typically, batteries are placed in applica-
tions where their internal resistance is negligible compared to that of the circuit load (where
their short-circuit current far exceeds their usual load current), and so the performance is very
close to that of an ideal voltage source.
