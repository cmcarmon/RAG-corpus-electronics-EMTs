The original distance covariance has been defined as the square root of




dCov

⁡
(
X
,
Y
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {dCov} ^{2}(X,Y)}
, rather than the squared coefficient itself.



dCov
⁡
(
X
,
Y
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {dCov} (X,Y)}
has the property that it is the energy distance between the joint distribution of



X
,
Y


{\displaystyle \operatorname {X} ,Y}
and the product of its marginals. Under this definition, however, the distance variance, rather than the distance standard deviation, is measured in the same units as the



X


{\displaystyle \operatorname {X} }
distances.
Alternately, one could define distance covariance to be the square of the energy distance:




dCov

⁡
(
X
,
Y
)
.


{\displaystyle \operatorname {dCov} ^{2}(X,Y).}
In this case, the distance standard deviation of



X


{\displaystyle X}
is measured in the same units as



X


{\displaystyle X}
distance, and there exists an unbiased estimator for the population distance covariance.
Under these alternate definitions, the distance correlation is also defined as the square




dCor

(
X
,
Y
)


{\displaystyle \operatorname {dCor} ^{2}(X,Y)}
, rather than the square root.
