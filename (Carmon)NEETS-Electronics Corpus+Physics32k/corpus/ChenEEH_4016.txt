Architecture-Driven Synthesis
One of the well-known DSP synthesis tools is the Cathedral I/
II/III (De Man et al., 1990, 1988; Note et al., 1991). A DSP
algorithm is described as a graph with operators as vertices
and with arcs representing the ﬂow of data in a language
called SILAGE. The bit-true speciﬁcation of all signal for-
mats is speciﬁed up to bit-level including quantization and
overﬂow characteristics. Since Cathedral is characterized as an
architecture-driven synthesis tool, it supports the following
architectural styles. Each architecture style is categorized
by sample rate.
