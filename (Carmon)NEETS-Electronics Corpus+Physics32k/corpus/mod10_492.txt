A problem using this equation will illustrate how to determine the characteristics of a transmission
line. Assume that the line shown in figure 3-23 is 1000 feet long. A 100-foot (approximately 30.5 meter)
section is measured to determine L and C. The section is found to have an inductance of 0.25 millihenries
and a capacitance of 1000 picofarads. Find the characteristic impedance of the line and the velocity of the
wave on the line.
