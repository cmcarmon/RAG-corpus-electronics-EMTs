Behaving differently depending on frequency
Like capacitors, inductors in an AC circuit act differently depending on 
the frequency of the voltage applied to them. Because the current passing 
through an inductor is affected by frequency, the voltage drops across the 
inductor and other components in the circuit are also affected by frequency. 
This frequency‐dependent behavior forms the basis for useful functions, such 
as filters, which are circuits that allow some frequencies to pass through to 
another circuit stage while blocking other frequencies. When you adjust the 
bass and treble settings on your stereo system, you’re using filters.
