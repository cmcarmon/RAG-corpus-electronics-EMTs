Silicone rubber is classiﬁed as an organic-inorganic elastomer, which is obtained from the polymerization
of organic siloxanes. They are composed of dimethyl-siloxane repeat units, (CH3)2SiO–, with the side groups
being methyl units. Fillers are added to obtain the desired silicone rubber compounds; cross linking is carried
out  with  peroxides.  Since  no  softeners  and  plasticizers  are  required,  silicone  rubbers  are  resistant  to
embrittlement and may be employed for low- temperature applications down to –120(cid:176)F. Continuous operation
is possible up to 500(cid:176)F, with intermittent usage as high as 700(cid:176)F.
