The induction machine may thus be viewed as a transformer with an air gap and variable
resistance in the secondary; the stator of the induction machine corresponds to the transformer
primary, and the rotor corresponds to the secondary. For analysis of the balanced steady state, it
is sufÔ¨Åcient to proceed on a per-phase basis with some phasor concepts; so we will now develop
an equivalent circuit on a per-phase basis. Only machines with symmetrical polyphase windings
excited by balanced polyphase voltages are considered. As in other discussions of polyphase
devices, let us think of three-phase machines as wye-connected, so that currents are always line
values and voltages are always line-to-neutral values (on a per-phase basis).
