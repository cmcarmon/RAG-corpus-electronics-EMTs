Near the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity g = 9.81 m/s2 (meters per second squared; which might be thought of as "meters per second, per second", or 32.2 ft/s2 as "feet per second per second") approximately. For other planets, multiply g by the appropriate scaling factor. A coherent set of units for g, d, t and v is essential. Assuming SI units, g is measured in meters per second squared, so d must be measured in meters, t in seconds and v in meters per second.
In all cases, the body is assumed to start from rest, and air resistance is neglected. Generally, in Earth's atmosphere, all results below will therefore be quite inaccurate after only 5 seconds of fall (at which time an object's velocity will be a little less than the vacuum value of 49 m/s (9.8 m/s2 Ã— 5 s) due to air resistance). Air resistance induces a drag force on any body that falls through any atmosphere other than a perfect vacuum, and this drag force increases with velocity until it equals the gravitational force, leaving the object to fall at a constant terminal velocity.
Atmospheric drag, the coefficient of drag for the object, the (instantaneous) velocity of the object, and the area presented to the airflow determine terminal velocity.
Apart from the last formula, these formulas also assume that g negligibly varies with height during the fall (that is, they assume constant acceleration). The last equation is more accurate where significant changes in fractional distance from the center of the planet during the fall cause significant changes in g. This equation occurs in many applications of basic physics.
