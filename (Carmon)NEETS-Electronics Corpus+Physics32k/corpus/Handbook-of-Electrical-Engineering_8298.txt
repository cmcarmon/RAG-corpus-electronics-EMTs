Aliasing: Whenever the faulty output produces the same signature as a fault-free output.
Built-in self-test (BIST): The inclusion of on-chip circuitry to provide testing.
Fault coverage: The fraction of possible failures that the test technique can detect.
Fault simulation: An empirical method used to determine how faults affect the operation of the circuit and
