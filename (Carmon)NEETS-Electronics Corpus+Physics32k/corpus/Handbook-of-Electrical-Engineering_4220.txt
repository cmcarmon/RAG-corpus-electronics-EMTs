In  contrast,  the  radar  data  processor  typically  consists  of  a  general-purpose  computer  with  a  real-time
operating system. Fielded radar data processors range from microcomputers to mainframe computers, depend-
ing on the requirements of the radar system. Data processor software and hardware requirements are signiﬁ-
cantly mitigated by off loading timing and control functions to specialized hardware. This timing and control
subsystem  typically  functions  as  the  two-way  interface  between  the  data  processor  and  the  other  radar  sub-
systems. The increasing inclusion of BIT (built-in-test) and built-in calibration capability in timing and control
subsystem designs promises to result in signiﬁcant improvement in ﬁelded system performance.
