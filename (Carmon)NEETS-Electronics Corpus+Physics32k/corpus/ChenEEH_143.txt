3. This discussion also suggests that it is not necessary to
use the same time step when determining the time
domain solution of a circuit over a long period of
time. It is possible to change the time step during the
computation based on error and accuracy requirements.
4. The Newtonâ€“Raphson method is used at each time
step to solve a set of nonlinear equations. For this
method, a good initial guess gives the solution in
fewer iterations. Such formulae, called predictor for-
mulae, are available and reduce the overall computa-
tion needed for the solution.
