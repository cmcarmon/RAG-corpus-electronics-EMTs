at which point the device breaks down. The critical electric
is roughly 2  105 V=cm. A nonpunchthrough
ﬁeld for Si
diode has drift region doping (ND) and width (WD, pp) param-
eters such that the critical electric ﬁeld is reached before the
entire region is depleted. In such cases, the breakdown voltage,
VBD, and depletion width at breakdown, WD, for a given
doping level are expressed as:
