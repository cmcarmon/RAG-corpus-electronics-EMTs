If the eccentricity equals 1, then the orbit equation becomes:

{\displaystyle r={{h^{2}} \over {\mu }}{{1} \over {1+\cos \theta }}}

where:




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the mass center of the central body,




h



{\displaystyle h\,}
is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body,




θ



{\displaystyle \theta \,}
is the true anomaly of the orbiting body,




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
As the true anomaly θ approaches 180°, the denominator approaches zero, so that r tends towards infinity. Hence, the energy of the trajectory for which e=1 is zero, and is given by:

{\displaystyle \epsilon ={v^{2} \over 2}-{\mu  \over {r}}=0}

where:




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is the speed of the orbiting body.
In other words, the speed anywhere on a parabolic path is:

{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {2\mu  \over {r}}}}
