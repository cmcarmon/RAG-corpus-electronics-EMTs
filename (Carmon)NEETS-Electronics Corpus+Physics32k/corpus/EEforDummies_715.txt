Don’t assume that all ICs with the same number of pins have the same p inouts 
(arrangement of external connections — in this case, pins), or even that 
they use the same pins for power connections. And never — never! — make 
random connections to IC pins, under the misguided notion that you can 
explore different connections until you get the IC to work. That’s a sure‐fire 
way to destroy a poor, defenseless circuit.
