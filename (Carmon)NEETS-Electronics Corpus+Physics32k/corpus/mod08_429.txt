Of course, the permeability does not suddenly change from 5000 to 1. The permeability changes as
the magnetizing force changes until saturation is reached. At saturation, permeability remains very low no
matter how much the magnetizing force increases. If you were to draw a graph of the flux density
compared to the magnetizing force, you would have something similar to the graph shown in figure 3-31.
Figure 3-31 also includes a curve representing the value of permeability as the magnetizing force
increases. Point "s" in figure 3-31 is the point of saturation. The flux density does not increase above
point "s," and the permeability is at a steady, low value.
