DON’T  attempt  to  measure  resistance  in  a  circuit 
that has the power applied to it. 
 
DON’T rely on voltage and current readings made 
on  circuits  where  high-frequency  signals  may  be 
present  (as  with  analogue  instruments,  digital 
meters  may  produce  readings  that  are  wildly 
inaccurate or misleading in such circumstances). 
 
DON’T 
rely  on  measurements  made  when 
voltage/current  is  changing  or  when  a  significant 
amount  of  AC  may  be  present  superimposed  on  a 
DC level.
