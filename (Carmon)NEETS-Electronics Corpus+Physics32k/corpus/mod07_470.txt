With the supply voltage removed from the input to the filter circuit, one terminal of the capacitor can 
be disconnected from the circuit. The capacitor should be checked with a capacitance analyzer to 
determine its capacitance and leakage resistance. When the capacitor is electrolytic, you must use the 
correct polarity at all times. A decrease in capacitance or losses within the capacitor can decrease the 
efficiency of the filter and can produce excessive ripple amplitude.
