where Hi represents the histogram of frame fi and M  N is
the dimension of each frame. For each histogram, 256 uniform
quantization levels for each channel are considered. SDM is
deÔ¨Åned in terms of the difference in intensity levels between
successive frames at each pixel location. Let Ii, j(fk) denote the
