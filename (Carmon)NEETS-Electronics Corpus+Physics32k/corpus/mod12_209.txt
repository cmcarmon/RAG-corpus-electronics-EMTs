Heterodyning the audio frequency intelligence from the modulator (V2) with the carrier in the plate 
circuit of the final power amplifier (V1) requires a large amount of audio power. All of the power or 
voltage that contains the intelligence must come from the modulator stage. This is why plate modulation 
is called high-level modulation.
