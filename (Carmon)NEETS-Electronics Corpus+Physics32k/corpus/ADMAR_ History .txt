ADMAR was developed on the basis of ADKAR and GAME footing on the special Agreement of MOD Germany (BMVg â€“ A/13/D/HG/82, April 18, 1983) in cooperation with EUROCONTROL. It has been operational since 1983 and was used by the German Air Force exclusively. Since 2003 it became of interest for other European countries, NATO and security related authorities and organisations as well. ADMAR 2000 was the final software release.
