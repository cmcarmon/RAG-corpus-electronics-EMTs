Atmospheric neutrinos are secondary cosmic rays produced by the decay of particles resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays (mostly proton) with Earth atmosphere. We classified the observed atmospheric neutrino data into four types. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector but stop in the inner detector.
The number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained that neutrinos changes or oscillated into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called neutrino oscillation and this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests to extend the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinsinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of “Length/Energy”, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.
