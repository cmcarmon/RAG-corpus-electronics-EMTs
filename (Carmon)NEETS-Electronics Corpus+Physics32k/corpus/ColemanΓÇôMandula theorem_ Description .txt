Every quantum field theory satisfying the assumptions,
Below any mass M, there are only finite number of particle types
Any two-particle state undergoes some reaction at almost all energies
The amplitude for elastic two body scattering are analytic functions of scattering angle at almost all energies,
and that has non-trivial interactions can only have a Lie group symmetry which is always a direct product of the Poincar√© group and an internal group if there is a mass gap: no mixing between these two is possible. As the authors say in the introduction to the 1967 publication, "We prove a new theorem on the impossibility of combining space-time and internal symmetries in any but a trivial way."
