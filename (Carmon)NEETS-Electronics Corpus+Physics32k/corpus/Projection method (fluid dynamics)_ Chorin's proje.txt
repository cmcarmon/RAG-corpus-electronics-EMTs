The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (differential form of momentum equation) may be written as

In Chorin's original version of the projection method, one first computes an intermediate velocity,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ^{*}}
, explicitly using the momentum equation by ignoring the pressure gradient term:

where





u

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ^{n}}
is the velocity at

One can rewrite this equation in the form of a time step as

to make clear that the algorithm is really just an operator splitting approach in which one considers the viscous forces (in the first half step) and the pressure forces (in the second half step) separately.
Computing the right-hand side of the second half step requires knowledge of the pressure,




p


{\displaystyle \,p}
, at the

)


{\displaystyle \,(n+1)}
time level. This is obtained by taking the divergence and requiring that

u

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} ^{n+1}=0}
, which is the divergence (continuity) condition, thereby deriving the following Poisson equation for

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ^{*}=\mathbf {u} ^{n+1}+{\frac {\Delta t}{\rho }}\,\nabla p^{n+1}}

are

{\displaystyle \nabla p^{n+1}\cdot \mathbf {n} =0}
. In practice, this condition is responsible for the errors this method shows close to the boundary of the domain since the real pressure (i.e., the pressure in the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations) does not satisfy such boundary conditions.
For the explicit method, the boundary condition for





u


∗




{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} ^{*}}
in equation (1) is natural. If




u

⋅

n

=
0


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {n} =0}
on



∂

{\displaystyle \partial \Omega }
, is prescribed, then the space of divergence-free vector fields will be orthogonal to the space of irrotational vector fields, and from equation (2) one has

on


∂

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial p^{n+1}}{\partial n}}=0\qquad {\text{on}}\quad \partial \Omega }

The explicit treatment of the boundary condition may be circumvented by using a staggered grid and requiring that



∇

u

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} ^{n+1}}
vanish at the pressure nodes that are adjacent to the boundaries.
A distinguishing feature of Chorin's projection method is that the velocity field is forced to satisfy a discrete continuity constraint at the end of each time step.
