Such instruments were useful in their time, but have little place in the modern world ex-
cept as proof-of-concept and elementary experimental devices. They are highly susceptible to
motion of any kind, and to any disturbances in the natural magnetic ﬁeld of the earth. Now,
the term ”galvanometer” usually refers to any design of electromagnetic meter movement built
for exceptional sensitivity, and not necessarily a crude device such as that shown in the pho-
tograph. Practical electromagnetic meter movements can be made now where a pivoting wire
coil is suspended in a strong magnetic ﬁeld, shielded from the majority of outside inﬂuences.
Such an instrument design is generally known as a permanent-magnet, moving coil, or PMMC
movement:
