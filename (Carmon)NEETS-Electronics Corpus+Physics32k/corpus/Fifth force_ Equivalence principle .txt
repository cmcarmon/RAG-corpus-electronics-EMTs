One way to search for a fifth force is with tests of the strong equivalence principle: this is one of the most powerful tests of Einstein's theory of gravity: general relativity. Alternative theories of gravity, such as Brans–Dicke theory, have a fifth force—possibly with infinite range. This is because gravitational interactions, in theories other than general relativity, have degrees of freedom other than the "metric", which dictates the curvature of space, and different kinds of degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a scalar field cannot produce the bending of light rays. The fifth force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits, called the Nordtvedt effect. This is tested with Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment and very long baseline interferometry.
