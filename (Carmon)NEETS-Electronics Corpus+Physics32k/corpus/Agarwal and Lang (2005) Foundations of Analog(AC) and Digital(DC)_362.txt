First, observe the symmetry property of this resistive network. From any of the eight
vertices, the network looks identical, and therefore, the resistance between any pair of
vertices connected by the solid diagonal (for example, (a)-(g), (b)-(h), (e)-(c), etc.) is the
same. Furthermore, looking into A, the set of paths from A to B starting along the
edge (a)-(d) are matched by a set of paths starting along the edge (a)-(b), or by a set of
paths starting along the edge (a)-(e). Therefore, when we apply a current I as shown in
Figure 2.53, it must split evenly into i1, i2, and i3. Likewise, it draws current off the
network evenly, that is, i4, i5, and i6 are the same. Since the same current and resistance
causes the same voltage drop across the resistors, we conclude that nodes (b), (d), and
(e) have the same voltage, and nodes (h), (c), and (f) also have the same voltage with
respect to any reference node.
