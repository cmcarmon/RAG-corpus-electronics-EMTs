Conductors lose all of their electrical resistance when cooled to super-low temperatures (near
absolute zero, about -273o Celsius). It must be understood that superconductivity is not merely
an extrapolation of most conductors’ tendency to gradually lose resistance with decreasing
temperature; rather, it is a sudden, quantum leap in resistivity from ﬁnite to nothing. A
superconducting material has absolutely zero electrical resistance, not just some small amount.
Superconductivity was ﬁrst discovered by H. Kamerlingh Onnes at the University of Lei-
den, Netherlands in 1911. Just three years earlier, in 1908, Onnes had developed a method of
liquefying helium gas, which provided a medium with which to supercool experimental objects
to just a few degrees above absolute zero. Deciding to investigate changes in electrical resis-
tance of mercury when cooled to this low of a temperature, he discovered that its resistance
dropped to nothing just below the boiling point of helium.
