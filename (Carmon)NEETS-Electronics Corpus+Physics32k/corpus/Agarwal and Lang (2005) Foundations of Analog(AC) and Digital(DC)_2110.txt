The name operational amplifier originates from the bygone days of the ana-
log computer (1940 1960),
in which the constants in differential equations
were represented by the gains of amplifiers. Thus these amplifiers, con-
structed from balanced pairs of specially manufactured vacuum tubes, had
to have reliable, known, fixed gains. Because transistors are inherently more
temperature-dependent than vacuum tubes, it was at first thought that satisfac-
tory transistor Op Amps could not be built. But in 1964, it was discovered that
by fabricating balanced transistor pairs close together on a single silicon chip to
minimize thermal gradients, the temperature problems could be overcome. And
thus were born in rapid succession the 703, the 709, and then the ubiquitous
741. Op Amps are rarely used for analog computers now, but instead have
become universal building blocks in all aspects of analog circuitry.
