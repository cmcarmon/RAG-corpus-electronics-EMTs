The family of bipolar junction transistors has two members: the npn BJT and the pnp BJT. Both
types contain semiconductor junctions which operate with bipolar internal currents consisting of
holes and electrons. These are illustrated in Figure 7.3.1 along with their circuit symbols. The
emitter in the circuit symbol is identiﬁed by the lead having the arrowhead. The arrow points
in the direction of conventional emitter current ﬂow when the base–emitter junction is forward
biased. A transistor can operate in three modes: cutoff, saturation, and active. In the active mode,
for an npn BJT, the base–emitter junction (BEJ) is forward-biased by a voltage vBE, while the
collector–base junction (CBJ) is reverse-biased by a voltage vCB. Thus for an npn BJT, as shown
in Figure 7.3.1(a), iB and iC are positive quantities such that iB + iC = iE. For a pnp BJT on the
other hand, in the active region, the base–emitter and collector–base voltages are negative, and
