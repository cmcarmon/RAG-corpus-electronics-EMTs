1. Read-only and read or write (R/W) access: Some
memories are used only to store constant data, such
as read-only memories or ROMs. Good alternatives
include programmable logic arrays (PLA) or multilevel
logic circuits, especially when the amount of data is
relatively small. In most cases, data needs to be over-
writable at high speeds, which means that read and
write are treated with the same priority (R/W access),
