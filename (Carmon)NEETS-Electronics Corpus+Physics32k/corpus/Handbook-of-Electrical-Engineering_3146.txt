Cycloconverters
Cycloconverters are direct ac-to-ac frequency changers. The term direct conversion means that the energy does
not appear in any form other than the ac input or ac output. The output frequency is lower than the input
frequency and is generally an integral multiple of the input frequency. A cycloconverter permits energy to be
fed  back  into  the  utility  network  without  any  additional  measures.  Also,  the  phase  sequence  of  the  output
voltage can be easily reversed by the control system. Cycloconverters have found applications in aircraft systems
and  industrial  drives.  These  cycloconverters  are  suitable  for  synchronous  and  induction  motor  control.  The
operation of the cycloconverter is illustrated in Section 30.4 of this chapter.
