FIGURE 5.1
Junction Diodes. (A) This ﬁgure shows a cross-section of a discrete pn-diode with a guard-ring for preventing perimeter
breakdown. (B) Illustrated here is a schematic doping proﬁle (assuming an abrupt junction) along a one-dimensional (1-D) cut through the
center with deﬁnitions of neutral region (NR), space-charge region (SCR), and the respective dimensions.
