A much more common application of electrostatic voltage measurement is seen in an device
known as a Cathode Ray Tube, or CRT. These are special glass tubes, very similar to tele-
vision viewscreen tubes. In the cathode ray tube, a beam of electrons traveling in a vacuum
are deﬂected from their course by voltage between pairs of metal plates on either side of the
beam. Because electrons are negatively charged, they tend to be repelled by the negative plate
and attracted to the positive plate. A reversal of voltage polarity across the two plates will
result in a deﬂection of the electron beam in the opposite direction, making this type of meter
”movement” polarity-sensitive:
