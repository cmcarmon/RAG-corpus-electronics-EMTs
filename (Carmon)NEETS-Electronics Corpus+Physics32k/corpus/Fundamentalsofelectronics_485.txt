Problem 4.11: Mathematics with Circuits
Simple circuits can implement simple mathematical operations, such as integration and diï¬€erentiation. We
want to develop an active circuit (it contains an op-amp) having an output that is proportional to the
integral of its input. For example, you could use an integrator in a car to determine distance traveled from
the speedometer.
(a) What is the transfer function of an integrator?
(b) Find an op-amp circuit so that its voltage output is proportional to the integral of its input for all
