When the circuit time constant is much longer than the square-wave
period, waveform d, shown in Figure 10.8, results. Here the transient clearly
does not go to completion. In fact, only the first part of the exponential is
ever seen. The waveform looks almost triangular, the integral of the input
wave. This can be seen from the differential equation describing the circuit.
Application of KVL gives
