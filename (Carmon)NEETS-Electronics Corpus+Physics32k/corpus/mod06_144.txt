DeForest’s triode was not very successful as a radio "detector." (Detectors will be studied in a later
NEETS module.) However, in 1912, De Forest discovered that his original triode could AMPLIFY or
magnify very weak electrical impulses. It is because of the triode’s ability to amplify that De Forest is
honored as one of the great radio pioneers.
