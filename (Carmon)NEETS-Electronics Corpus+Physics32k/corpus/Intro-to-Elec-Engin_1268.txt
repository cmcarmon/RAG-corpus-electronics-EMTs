*13.4.12 A dc series motor operates at 750 r/min with
a line current of 100 A from the 250-V mains.
Its armature-circuit resistance is 0.15  and its
series-ﬁeld resistance is 0.1 . Assuming that
the ﬂux corresponding to a current of 25 A is
40% of that corresponding to a current of 100 A,
determine the motor speed at a line current of 25
A at 250 V.
