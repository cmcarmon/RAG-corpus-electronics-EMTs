With the break between 3 and 4, the polarity of the voltage drop between those two points
is ”+” for 4 and ”-” for 3. Take special note of the fact that point 3’s ”sign” is opposite of that in
the ﬁrst example, where the break was between points 2 and 3 (where point 3 was labeled ”+”).
It is impossible for us to say that point 3 in this circuit will always be either ”+” or ”-”, because
polarity, like voltage itself, is not speciﬁc to a single point, but is always relative between two
points!
