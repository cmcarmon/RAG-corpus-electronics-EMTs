The velocity of the electrons traveling toward the plate varies directly with the plate voltage. If the
plate voltage is very low, the gas-filled diode acts almost like an ordinary diode except that the electron
stream is slowed to a certain extent by the gas molecules. These slower-moving electrons do not have
enough energy to cause ionization when they hit the gas atoms. After the plate voltage is raised to the
proper level of conduction, the electrons have enough energy to cause ionization when they hit the gas
molecules. The plate potential at which ionization occurs is known as the IONIZATION POINT, or
FIRING POTENTIAL, of a gas tube. If the plate voltage is reduced after ionization, it can be allowed to
go several volts below the firing potential before ionization (and hence, high-plate current) win cease. The
value of the plate voltage (Ep) at which ionization stops is called the DEIONIZATION POTENTIAL, or
EXTINCTION POTENTIAL. The firing point is always at a higher plate potential than the deionization
point.
