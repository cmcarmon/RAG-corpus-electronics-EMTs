Japan and North America use the National Television Systems Committee (NTSC) standard that speciﬁes
525 scanning lines per picture, a ﬁeld rate of 59.94 per second (nominally 60 Hz), and 2:1 interlaced scanning
(although  there  are  about  60  ﬁelds  per  second,  there  are  only  30  new  frames  per  second).  The aspect ratio
(ratio of width to height) is 4:3. The bandwidth of the television signal is 6 MHz, including the sound signal.
In  Europe  and  some  other  countries,  the  phase-alternation  line  (PAL)  or  the  sequential  color  and  memory
(SECAM) standard is used. This speciﬁes 625 scanning lines per picture and a ﬁeld rate of 50 per second. The
bandwidth of this type of television signal is 8 MHz.
