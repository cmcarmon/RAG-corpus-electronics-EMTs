Before you are shown the actual components that make up the frequency-determining network for an
rf amplifier, look at figure 2-13, which is a simple parallel circuit. The resistors in this circuit are variable
and are connected together (ganged) in such a way that as the resistance of R1 increases, the resistance of
R2 decreases, and vice versa.
