(b) A music group known as the ROwls is having trouble selling its recordings. The record company’s
engineer gets the idea of applying diﬀerent delay to the low and high frequencies and adding the result
to create a new musical eﬀect. Thus, the ROwls’ audio would be separated into two parts (one less
than the frequency f0, the other greater than f0), these would be delayed by τl and τh respectively,
and the resulting signals added. Draw a block diagram for this new audio processing system, showing
its various components.
