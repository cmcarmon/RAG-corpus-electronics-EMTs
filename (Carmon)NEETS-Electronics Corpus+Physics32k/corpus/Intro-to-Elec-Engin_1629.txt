Applications for the Electronic Control of Motors
A wide range of variable-speed drive systems are now available, each having particular advantages
and disadvantages. The potential user needs to evaluate each application on its own merit, with
consideration given to both technical limitations of particular systems and long-term economics.
A number of possible applications of the electronic control of motors are listed in Table 16.1.4.
