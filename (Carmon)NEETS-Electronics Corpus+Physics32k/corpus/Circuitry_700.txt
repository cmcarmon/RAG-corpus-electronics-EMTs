(cid:127) What fault symptoms do you notice? 
 
The  answers  to  these  questions  are  crucial  and,     
once  the  information  has  been  analysed,  the  next 
stage  involves  separating  the  ‘effects’  from  the 
‘cause’.  Here  you  should  list  each  of  the  possible 
causes.  Once  this  has  been  done,  you  should  be 
able to identify and focus upon the most probable 
cause.  Corrective  action  (such  as  component 
removal and replacement, adjustment or alignment) 
can then be applied before further functional checks 
are  carried  out.  It  should  then  be  possible  to 
determine  whether  or  not  the  fault  has  been 
correctly identified. Note, however, that the failure 
of  one  component  can  often 
the 
malfunction  or  complete  failure  of  another.  As  an 
example, a short-circuit capacitor will often cause a 
fuse  to  blow.  When  the  fuse  is  replaced  and  the 
supply is reconnected the fuse will once again blow 
because  the  capacitor  is  still  faulty.  It  is  therefore 
important to consider what other problems may be 
present when a fault is located.
