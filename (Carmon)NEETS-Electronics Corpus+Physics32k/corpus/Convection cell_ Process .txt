A rising body of fluid typically loses heat when it encounters a cold surface, when it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange, or in the example of the Earth's atmosphere, when it radiates heat. At some point the fluid becomes denser than the fluid beneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again through surface contact or conductivity and the cycle repeats. Air warms, becomes less dense, rises. Then air cools, becomes more dense, sinks. Then cool air at the bottom.
