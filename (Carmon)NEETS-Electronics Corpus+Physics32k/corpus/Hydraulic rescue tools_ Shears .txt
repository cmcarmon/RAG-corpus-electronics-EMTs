The cutter is a hydraulic tool that is designed to cut through metalâ€”a pair of hydraulically powered shears. It is often called the jaws of life, owing to the shape and configuration of its blades. Sometimes specified as to its capacity to cut a solid circular steel bar, these are most commonly used to cut through a vehicle's structure in an extraction operation. Cutter blades are replaceable, and blade development progresses as vehicle technology progresses in order to be able to cope with the new car protection technology.
