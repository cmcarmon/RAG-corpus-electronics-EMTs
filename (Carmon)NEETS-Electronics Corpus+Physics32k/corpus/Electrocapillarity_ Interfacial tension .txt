The interfacial (surface) tension, St, (dyne cm−1), can be calculated by applying the equation of capillary rise method (when the contact angle Ө → 0):
St = ½ h r g d
where:
h (cm) is the height of Hg column above the Hg meniscus in the capillary
r (cm) is the radius of capillary
d (g cm−3) is the Hg density
g is the acceleration due to gravity, g = 981 cm s−2.
The circuit contains Hg electrode as the ideally polarizable electrode and a reference electrode as the non-polarizable electrode. Thus, when an external voltage is applied, only EM/S of Hg/solution interface is changed.
