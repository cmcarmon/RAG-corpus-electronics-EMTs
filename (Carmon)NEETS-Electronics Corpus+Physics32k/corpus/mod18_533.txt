The sources of these X rays are usually confined to magnetrons, klystrons, and cathode-ray tubes. 
Personnel should not linger near any of these types of equipments when the equipment covers have been 
removed. Klystrons, magnetrons, rectifiers, or other tubes that employ an excitation of 15,000 volts or 
more may emit X rays out to a few feet; thus, unshielded personnel standing or working close to the tubes 
will be endangered.
