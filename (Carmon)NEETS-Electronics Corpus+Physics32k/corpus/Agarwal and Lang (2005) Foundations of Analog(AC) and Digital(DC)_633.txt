Note that ID is simply the DC bias current related to the DC input voltage
VD. Accordingly, the DC terms relating ID to VD can be equated as in Equa-
tion 4.62 because the operating point values ID, VD satisfy Equation 4.1, which
is the diode equation. When the DC terms are eliminated from both sides of
Equation 4.61, the incremental relation shown in Equation 4.63 results.
Thus the response current to an applied voltage VD + vD contains two
terms: a large DC current ID and a small current proportional to vD, if we
keep vD small enough.
