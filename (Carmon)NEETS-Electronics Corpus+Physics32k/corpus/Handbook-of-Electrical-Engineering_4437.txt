During the past decade signiﬁcant progress has been made in monolithic power ampliﬁers operating over
both  the  narrowband  and  broadband  [Williams  and  Bahl,  1992;  Tserng  and  Saunier,  1991].  Power  levels  as
high as 12 W from a single MMIC chip at C-band with 60% power-added efﬁciency (PAE) have been demon-
strated. A 6-W MMIC chip has been developed at X-band. A 2-W power output has been obtained at 30 GHz.
