A multi-register, bus-structured digital system will have the nth bit of each register connected to bit n of the
data bus at both the input and output of the register. In order to transfer data from one register to another,
or, more strictly, to transfer a copy of the contents of one register to another register, the output gates of the
source register must be enabled so that the data is fed on to the bus. This data becomes available at the inputs
of all registers and is latched in under the control of the appropriate input signals. It is important in the design
of the sequencing circuitry that only one set of register output gates can be enabled at any time, although the
data can be latched into as many registers as required.
