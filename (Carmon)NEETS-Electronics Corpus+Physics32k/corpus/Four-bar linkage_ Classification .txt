The movement of a quadrilateral linkage can be classified into eight cases based on the dimensions of its four links. Let a, b, g and h denote the lengths of the input crank, the output crank, the ground link and floating link, respectively. Then, we can construct the three terms:





T

1


=
g
+
h
−
a
−
b


{\displaystyle T_{1}=g+h-a-b}
;





T

2


=
b
+
g
−
a
−
h


{\displaystyle T_{2}=b+g-a-h}
;





T

3


=
b
+
h
−
a
−
g


{\displaystyle T_{3}=b+h-a-g}
.
The movement of a quadrilateral linkage can be classified into eight types based on the positive and negative values for these three terms, T1, T2, and T3.
The cases of T1= 0, T2=0, and T3=0 are interesting because the linkages fold. If we distinguish folding quadrilateral linkage, then there are 27 different cases.
The figure shows examples of the various cases for a planar quadrilateral linkage.

The configuration of a quadrilateral linkage may be classified into three types: convex, concave, and crossing. In the convex and concave cases no two links cross over each other. In the crossing linkage two links cross over each other. In the convex case all four internal angles are less than 180 degrees, and in the concave configuration one internal angle is greater than 180 degrees. There exists a simple geometrical relationship between the lengths of the two diagonals of the quadrilateral. For convex and crossing linkages, the length of one diagonal increases if and only if the other decreases. On the other hand, for nonconvex non-crossing linkages, the opposite is the case; one diagonal increases if and only if the other also increases.
