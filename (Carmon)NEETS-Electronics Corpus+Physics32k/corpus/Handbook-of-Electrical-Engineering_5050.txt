Sensors 
are critical components in all measurement and control systems. The need for computer-compatible
sensors closely followed the advent of the microprocessor. Together with the always-present need for sensors
in science and medicine, the demand for sensors in automated manufacturing and processing is rapidly growing.
In addition, small, inexpensive sensors are ﬁnding their way into all sorts of consumer products, from childrens’
toys  to  dishwashers  to  automobiles.  Because  of  the  vast  variety  of  useful  things  to  be  sensed  and  sensor
applications,  sensor  engineering  is  a  multidisciplinary  and  interdisciplinary  ﬁeld  of  endeavor.  This  chapter
introduces some basic deﬁnitions, concepts, and features of sensors and illustrates them with several examples.
The  reader  is  directed  to  the  references  and  the  sources  listed  under “Further  Information”  for  more  details
and examples.
