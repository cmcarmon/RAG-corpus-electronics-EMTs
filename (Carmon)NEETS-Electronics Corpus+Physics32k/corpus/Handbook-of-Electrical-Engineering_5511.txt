• Amortisseur windings on the pole faces of the generator rotors can be employed to improve damping.
• A more recent damping scheme [see Hingorani, 1981] is based on measuring the half-cycle period of
the series-capacitor voltage, and if this period exceeds a preset value, the capacitor’s charge is dissipated
into a resistor shunting the capacitor through two antiparallel thyristors.
