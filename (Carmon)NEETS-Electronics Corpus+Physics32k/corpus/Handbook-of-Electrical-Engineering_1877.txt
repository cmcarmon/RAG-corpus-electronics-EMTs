A simple heterogeneous architecture is shown in Fig. 17.26. This machine implements a sum-of-absolute-
differences  correlation  in  two  dimensions  for  block  motion  estimation.  The  architecture  of  this  machine  is
derived  from  the  data  ﬂow  of  the  computation,  where  for  each  offset  (r,  s),  the  sum-of-absolute  differences
between a n × n macroblock and a T × T reference area can be computed:
