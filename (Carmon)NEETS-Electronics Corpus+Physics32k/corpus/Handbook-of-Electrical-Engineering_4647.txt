There are four principal SAW properties: transduction, reﬂection, regeneration and nonlinearities. Nonlinear
elastic properties are principally used for convolvers and will not be discussed. The other three properties are
present, to some degree, in all SAW devices, and these properties must be understood and controlled to meet
device speciﬁcations.
