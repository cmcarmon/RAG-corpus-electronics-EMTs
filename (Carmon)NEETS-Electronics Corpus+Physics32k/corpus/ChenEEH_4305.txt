As optical ﬁlters and laser technology improved, the ability to
combine more than two signal wavelengths on a ﬁber became a
reality. Dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM)
combines multiple signals on the same ﬁber, ranging up to
40 or 80 channels. By implementing DWDM systems and
optical ampliﬁers, networks can provide a variety of bit rates
(i.e., OC–48 or OC–192) and a multitude of channels over a
single ﬁber (see Figure 8.4). The wavelengths used are all in the
range in which optical ampliﬁers perform optimally, typically
from about 1530 nm to 1565 nm.
