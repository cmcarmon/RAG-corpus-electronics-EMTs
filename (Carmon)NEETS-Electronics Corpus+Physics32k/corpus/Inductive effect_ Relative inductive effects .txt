Relative inductive effects have been experimentally measured with reference to hydrogen, in decreasing order of -I effect or increasing order of +I effect, as follows:
–NH3+ > –NO2 > –SO2R > –CN > –SO3H > –CHO > –CO > –COOH > –COCl> –CONH2 > –F > –Cl > –Br > –I > –OR > -OH > –NH2 > –C6H5 > –CH=CH2 > –H
The strength of inductive effect is also dependent on the distance between the substituent group and the main group that react; the greater the distance, the weaker the effect.
Inductive effects can be measured through the Hammett equation, which describes the relationship between reaction rates and equilibrium constants with respect to substituents.
