Step length is a measure of the distance, parallel to the direction of travel, between the initial point of contact of one foot and the successive initial point of contact of the opposite foot. The step lengths for left and right are similar in normal gait. Another metric similar to step length is known as stride length, which measures the distance between successive points of initial contact of the same foot, and left and right stride lengths are normally equivalent. At self-selected walking speeds, normal step length is approximately 0.75 meters for men and slightly less for women due to a gender-specific shorter average leg length. For other walking speeds, the preferred step length can be approximately predicted based on the relationship
