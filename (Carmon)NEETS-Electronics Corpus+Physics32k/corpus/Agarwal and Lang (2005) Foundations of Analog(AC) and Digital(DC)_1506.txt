How do we implement a memory element? The memory element must be
designed so that it stores indefinitely any value that has been written into it.
Recall that a capacitor has the same property. Provided its discharge path has
a high time constant, a capacitor can store a charge for a long period of time.
Furthermore, we can use a switch to enable charging the capacitor from a given
input.
