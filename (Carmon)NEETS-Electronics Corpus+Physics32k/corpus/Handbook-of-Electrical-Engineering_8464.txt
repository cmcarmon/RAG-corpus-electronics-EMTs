We also deﬁne explicit value xe and implicit value Xi of a number represented by a bit string x. The implicit
value is the only value of interest to the user, while the explicit value provides the most direct interpretation of
the bit string x. Mapping of the explicit value to the implicit value is obtained by an arithmetic function that
deﬁnes the number representation used. It is a task of the arithmetic designer to devise algorithms that result
in  the  correct  implicit  value  of  the  result  for  the  operations  on  the  operand  digits  representing  the  explicit
values. In other words, the arithmetic algorithm needs to satisfy the closure property.
