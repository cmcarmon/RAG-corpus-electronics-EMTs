In contrast to most manual gearboxes, most automatic transmissions have far less effective engine-braking. This means that the engine does not slow the vehicle as effectively when the automatic transmission driver releases the engine speed control. This leads to more usage of the brakes in vehicles with automatic transmissions, bringing shorter brake life. Brakes are also more likely to overheat in hilly or mountainous areas, causing reduced braking ability, brake fade, and the potential for complete failure with the automatic transmission vehicle.
