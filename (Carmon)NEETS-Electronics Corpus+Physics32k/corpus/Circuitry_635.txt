The  action  of  the  filament  lamp  is  comparable 
with  our  fundamental  dipole  aerial.  In  the  case  of 
the dipole, electromagnetic radiation will occur all 
around the dipole elements (in three dimensions the 
radiation pattern will take on a doughnut shape). In 
the plane that we have shown in Fig. 13.20(a), the 
directional pattern will be a figure-of-eight that has 
two lobes of equal size. In order to concentrate the 
radiation  into  just  one  of  the  radiation  lobes  we 
could simply place a reflecting mirror on one side 
of the filament lamp. The radiation will be reflected 
(during  which  the  reflected  light  will  undergo  a 
180Â° phase change) and this will reinforce the light 
on  one  side  of  the  filament  lamp.  In  order  to
