The  inputs  of  the  address  decoding  logic  are 
derived from one, or more, of the address bus lines. 
The  address  decoder  effectively  divides 
the 
available  memory  into  blocks  corresponding  to  a 
particular function (ROM, RAM, I/O, etc). Hence, 
where the processor is reading and writing to RAM, 
for example, the address decoding logic will ensure 
that only the RAM is selected whilst the ROM and 
I/O remain isolated from the data bus. 
  Within  the  CPU,  data  is  stored  in  several 
registers. Registers themselves can be thought of as 
a simple pigeon-hole arrangement that can store as 
many  bits  as  there  are  holes  available.  Generally, 
these devices can store groups of sixteen or thirty-
two  bits.  Additionally,  some  registers  may  be 
configured as either one register of sixteen bits or 
two registers of thirty-two bits. 
  Some  microprocessor  registers  are  accessible  to 
the  programmer  whereas  others  are  used  by  the 
microprocessor  itself.  Registers  may  be  classified 
as either general purpose or dedicated. In the latter 
case  a  particular  function  is  associated  with  the 
register, such as holding the result of an operation 
or signalling the result of a comparison.  A typical 
microprocessor  and  its  register  model  is  shown  in 
Fig. 11.8. 
 
The arithmetic logic unit 
 
The  ALU  can  perform  arithmetic  operations 
(addition 
logic 
(complementation,  logical  AND,  logical  OR,  etc). 
The ALU operates on two inputs (sixteen or thirty-
two  bits  in  length  depending  upon  the  CPU  type) 
and  it  provides  one  output  (again  of  sixteen  or 
thirty-two  bits).  In  addition,  the  ALU  status  is
