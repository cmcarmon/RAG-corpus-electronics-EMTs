A simple memory aid to help you remember the relationship of voltage and current in an inductive 
circuit is the word ELI. Since E is the symbol for voltage, L is the symbol for inductance, and I is the 
symbol for current; the word ELI demonstrates that current comes after (Lags) voltage in an inductor.
