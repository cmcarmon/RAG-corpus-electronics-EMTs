A shearing transformation will push the top of a square sideways to form a parallelogram. Horizontal shearing is defined by:




(

x
′

,

y
′

)
=
(
x
+
y
s
,
y
)


{\displaystyle (x',y')=(x+ys,y)}

Shearing can also be applied vertically:




(

x
′

,

y
′

)
=
(
x
,
x
s
+
y
)


{\displaystyle (x',y')=(x,xs+y)}
