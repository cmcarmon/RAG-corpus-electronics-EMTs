Block device I/O uses a buffer cache to reduce the number of
disk accesses. An LRU algorithm is used to manage the cache.
Character I/O can be done in raw or cooked mode, the latter of
which is implemented by a line discipline. Line discipline acts
like a Ô¨Ålter, taking the raw character stream from the terminal
driver, processing it, and producing what is called a cooked
character stream.
