A screw is a six-dimensional vector constructed from a pair of three-dimensional vectors, such as forces and torques and linear and angular velocity, that arise in the study of spatial rigid body movement. The components of the screw define the Pl√ºcker coordinates of a line in space and the magnitudes of the vector along the line and moment about this line.
