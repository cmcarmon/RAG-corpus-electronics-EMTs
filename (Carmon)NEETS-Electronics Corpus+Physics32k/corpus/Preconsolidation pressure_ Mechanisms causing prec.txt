Various different factors can cause a soil to approach its preconsolidation pressure:
Change in total stress due to removal of overburden can cause preconsolidation pressure in a soil. For example, removal of structures or glaciation would cause a change in total stress that would have this effect.
Change in pore water pressure: A change in water table elevation, Artesian pressures, deep pumping or flow into tunnels, and desiccation due to surface drying or plant life can bring soil to its preconsolidation pressure.
Change in soil structure due to aging (secondary compression): Over time, soil will consolidate even after high pressures from loading and pore water pressure have been depleted.
Environmental changes: Changes in pH, temperature, and salt concentration can cause a soil to approach its preconsolidation pressure.
Chemical weathering: Different types of chemical weathering will cause preconsolidation pressure. Precipitation, cementing agents, and ion exchange are a few examples.
