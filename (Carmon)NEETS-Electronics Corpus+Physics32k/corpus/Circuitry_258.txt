It  is  worth  noting  that  current  gain  (hfe) varies 
with  collector  current.  For  most  small-signal 
transistors, hfe is a maximum at a collector current 
in the range 1 mA and 10 mA. Furthermore, current 
gain falls to  very low  values for power transistors 
when  operating  at  very  high  values  of  collector 
current.  Another  point  worth  remembering  is  that 
most  transistor  parameters  (particularly  common-
emitter current gain, hfe are liable to wide variation 
from  one  device  to  the  next.  It  is,  therefore, 
important  to  design  circuits  on  the  basis  of  the 
minimum value for hfe in order to ensure successful 
operation with a variety of different devices. 
  Transistor  parameters  are  listed  in  Table  5.9, 
while  Table  5.10  shows  the  characteristics  of 
several  common 
transistor.
