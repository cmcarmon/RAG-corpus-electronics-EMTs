The mechanical rotation of a radially positioned permanent-magnet Halbach array above a conducting, nonmagnetic track induces eddy currents in the track that can inductively create suspension and propulsion forces simultaneously. The parameters that affect the performance of this electrodynamic wheel are studied using a 2-D steady-state finite-element method.
