Afc circuits are used in situations where you must accurately control the frequency of an oscillator
by some external signal. Basically, this type circuit does two things: It senses the difference between the
actual oscillator frequency and the frequency that is desired and produces a control voltage proportional
to the difference; it also uses the control voltage to change the oscillator to the desired frequency. Afc
circuits are used to control the frequency of sinusoidal oscillators and nonsinusoidal oscillators. Only
sinusoidal afc circuits will be covered here. Afc circuits are used in radio receivers, fm transmitters, and
frequency synthesizers to maintain frequency stability. Figure 2-26 is a block diagram illustrating afc
operation in a receiver. Letâ€™s run through the applicable parts of this block diagram.
