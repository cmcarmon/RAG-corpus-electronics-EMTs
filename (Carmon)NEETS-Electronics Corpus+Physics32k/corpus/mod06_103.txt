The silver spot you will sometimes see on the inside surface of the glass envelope of a vacuum tube
is normal. It was caused by the "flashing" of a chemical during the manufacture of the tube. Burning the
chemical, called the GETTER, helps to produce a better vacuum and eliminates any remaining gases.
