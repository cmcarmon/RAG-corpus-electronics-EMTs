The connectivity pattern of climate networks based on ground level temperature records shows a dense stripe of links in the extra tropics of the southern hemisphere. It is found that statistical categorization of these links yields a clear association with the pattern of the atmospheric Rossby waves. It is found that alternating densities of negative and positive links are arranged in half Rossby wave distances around 3500, 7000, and 10 000 km and are aligned with the expected direction of energy flow, distribution of time delays, and the seasonality of these waves. In addition, long distance links that are associated with Rossby waves are the most dominant in the climate network. On the relation between Rossby waves and climate networks during El-Nino see Wang .
