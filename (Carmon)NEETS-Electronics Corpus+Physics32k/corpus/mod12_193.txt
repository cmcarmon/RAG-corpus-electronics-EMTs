405 degrees. Vector L, representing the lower sideband, rotates at a velocity less than that of either the 
carrier or the upper sideband. In 1/8 of a second, vector L completes only 315 degrees, which is 45 
degrees short of one complete rotation. At the end of 1/8 of a second, the three vectors have advanced to 
the positions shown in view (B).
