As more users become involved with a program, its quirks become less acceptable and it must become easy to
use, i.e., user friendly. Second, with the availability of many different types of program, it became important
to be able to transfer the results of one program to the input of another. If the user has access to the source
code, this can often be done relatively quickly by generating an output Ô¨Åle in a suitable format for the input
of the second program. There has, therefore, been a great deal of attention devoted to creating common formats
for  data  transfer  as  well  as  producing  programs  with  easy  data  entry  formats  and  good  result  processing
capabilities.
