Figure 2-14 shows the direction and wavefronts of plane-wave propagation. Plane waves, or
wavefronts, propagate along the fiber similar to light rays. However, not all wavefronts incident on the
fiber at angles less than or equal to the critical angle of light acceptance propagate along the fiber.
Wavefronts may undergo a change in phase that prevents the successful transfer of light along the fiber.
