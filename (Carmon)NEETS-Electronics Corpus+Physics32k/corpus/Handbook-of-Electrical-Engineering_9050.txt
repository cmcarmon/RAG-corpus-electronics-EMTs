paste is typically screened onto a ceramic substrate. Materials for the resistor paste include borosilicate glass
and lanthanum glass-ruthenium oxide. The elements are typically 25 mm thick and slowly wear down by contact
with the paper. Since, with each approach, the resistive elements must be allowed to cool before the head is
ready  to  “write”  the  next  pixel  position  on  the  paper,  the  heating  and  cooling  time  constants  of  the  head
primarily determine the attainable print speed.
