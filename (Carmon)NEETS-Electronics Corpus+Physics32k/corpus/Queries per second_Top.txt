Queries per second (QPS) is a common measure of the amount of search traffic an information retrieval system, such as a search engine or a database, receives during one second. The term is used more broadly for any requestâ€“response system, more correctly called requests per second (RPS).
High-traffic systems must watch their QPS in order to know when to scale the system to handle more load.
