During the ﬁrst part of the twentieth century, circuit theory and electromagnetic theory were all an
electrical engineer needed to know to be qualiﬁed and produce ﬁrst-rate designs. Consequently, circuit theory
served as the foundation and the framework of all of electrical engineering education. At mid-century, three
“inventions” changed the ground rules. These were the ﬁrst public demonstration of the ﬁrst electronic
computer (1946), the invention of the transistor (1947), and the publication of A Mathematical Theory
of Communication by Claude Shannon (1948). Although conceived separately, these creations gave birth
to the information age, in which digital and analog communication systems interact and compete for design
preferences. About twenty years later, the laser was invented, which opened even more design possibilities.
Thus, the primary focus shifted from how to build communication systems (the circuit theory era) to what
communications systems were intended to accomplish. Only once the intended system is speciﬁed can an
implementation be selected. Today’s electrical engineer must be mindful of the system’s ultimate goal,
and understand the tradeoﬀs between digital and analog alternatives, and between hardware and software
conﬁgurations in designing information systems.
