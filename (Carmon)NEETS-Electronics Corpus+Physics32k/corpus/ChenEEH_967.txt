Zero skew islands can be satisﬁed by collapsing the corres-
ponding graph vertices into a single vertex while eliminating
all edges among vertices in the island. Note that in this case, it
must be veriﬁed that zero skew is in the permissible range of
each in-island path.24 Alternatively, the target delays are con-
verted to target skews (category 3 above) for sequentially
adjacent pairs or by adding a ‘‘fake’’ edge. Thus, an algorithm
to handle only target skews is necessary.
Note ﬁrst that target values for only nf  nb skews can be
independently speciﬁed. As nf approaches nb, the freedom to
vary all skews decreases, and it may become impossible to
determine any feasible s. Given nf  nb, (a) the basis can
always be chosen to contain all target skews by using a span-
ning tree algorithm with edge swapping and (b) the edge
enumeration can be accomplished such that the target skews
appear last in the basis. The problem is now similar to equa-
tion 4.51 except for the change of the circuit kernel equation:
