Site analysis determining soil load resistance is often required before earth anchor installation. Included are depth that the anchor is to be driven, and soil strength, moisture content, and corrosivity. When appropriate, test installations are done to determine optimal anchor design or conformance with project specifications.
Installation methods differ depending on soil composition and moisture. Earth anchors are commonly driven into the ground using a drive rod and impact hammer. Pilot holes are required in denser soils. After an impact driven anchor has been installed, the drive rod is removed and the anchor load-locked, typically by rotating it ninety degrees. For lighter anchors a hand tool is often sufficient.
