3. The braking mode has both mechanical and electric energy input. The total input is dissi-
pated as heat. The machine is driven by the externally applied torque T, while the electromagnetic
torque Te is opposing T, thereby braking the machine. The electric braking of motor drives
is achieved by causing the motor to act as a generator, receiving mechanical energy from the
moving parts and converting it to electric energy, which is dissipated in a resistor or pumped
back into the power line. Note that the applied voltage v and the generated emf e do not oppose
each other.
