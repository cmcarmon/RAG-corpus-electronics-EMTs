The problem is illustrated by the system of Fig. 100.42 with a symmetrical odd single-valued nonlinearity
conﬁned to a sector between lines of slope k 1 and k 2, that is, k 1x < n(x) < k 2x for x > 0. For absolute stability,
the circle criterion requires satisfying the Nyquist criterion for the locus  G( jw) for all points within a circle
having its diameter on the negative real axis of the Nyquist diagram between the points (–1/k 1, 0) and (–1/k 2, 0),
as shown in Fig. 100.50. On the other hand, because the DF for this nonlinearity lies within the diameter of
the circle, the DF method requires satisfying the Nyquist criterion for G(j w) for all points on the circle diameter,
if the autonomous system is to be stable.
