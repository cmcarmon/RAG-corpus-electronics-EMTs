An iron should be tinned (the application of solder to the tip after the iron is heated) prior to 
soldering a component in a circuit. After extended use of an iron, the tip tends to become pitted due to 
oxidation. Pitting indicates the need for retinning. The tip is retinned after first filing the tip until it is 
smooth (see figure 2-30).
