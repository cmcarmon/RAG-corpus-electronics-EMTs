• Write a KCL equation for each node 1,2, ... N. The positive coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst voltage
in the ﬁrst equation is the sum of conductances connected to the node. The coefﬁcient for
the second voltage in the second equation is the sum of conductances connected to that
node. Repeat for coefﬁcient of third voltage, third equation, and other equations. These
coefﬁcients fall on a diagonal.
