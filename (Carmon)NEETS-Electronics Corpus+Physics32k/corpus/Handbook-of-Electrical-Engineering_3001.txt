A  second  effect  of  emitter  degeneration  is  an  increase  in  both  the  low  frequency  driving  point  input  and
output resistances. This contention is conﬁrmed by Eq. (28.13), which shows that if Ro remains much larger
than (Rc + Re + REE + RLT), a resistance in the amount of (b
ac + 1)REE is added to the input resistance established
when  the  emitter  of  a  common  emitter  ampliﬁer  is  returned  to  signal  ground.  Likewise,  Eq.  (28.14)  veriﬁes
that emitter degeneration increases the low frequency driving point output resistance. In fact, a very large value
of REE produces an output resistance that approaches a limiting value of (b
ac + 1)Ro. It follows that a common
emitter  ampliﬁer  that  exploits  emitter  degeneration  behaves  as  a  voltage-to-current  converter  at  low  signal
frequencies. In particular, its high input resistance does not incur an appreciable load on signal voltage sources
that are characterized by even moderately large Thévenin resistances, while its large output resistance comprises
an almost ideal current source at its output port.
