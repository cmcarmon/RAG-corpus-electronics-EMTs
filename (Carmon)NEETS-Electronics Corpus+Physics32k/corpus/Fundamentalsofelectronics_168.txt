To verify, let’s ﬁnd the equivalent resistance by reaching inside the circuit and setting the current
source to zero. Because the current is now zero, we can replace the current source by an open circuit.
From the viewpoint of the terminals, resistor R3 is now in parallel with the series combination of
R1 and R2. Thus, Req = (R3 (cid:107) R1 + R2), and we obtain the same result.
