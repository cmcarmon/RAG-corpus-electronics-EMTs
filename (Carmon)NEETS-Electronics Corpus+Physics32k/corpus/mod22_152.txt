One of the latest technological developments in storage media is the introduction of bubble memory. 
Bubble memory consists of a very thin crystal made of semiconductor material. The molecules of this 
special crystal act as tiny magnets (fig. 2-5). The polarity of these molecules or "magnetic domains" can 
be switched in an opposite direction by passing a current through a control circuit imprinted on top of the 
crystal. In this manner, data can be stored by changing the polarity of the magnetic domains. Since the 
principle is the same as for magnetic core storage, bubble memory is considered nonvolatile. The data is 
retained even if there is a power failure. Furthermore, the process of reading from bubble memory is 
nondestructive, meaning that the data is still present after being read. This is not the case with core 
storage, which must be regenerated after being read. If we were to view these magnetic domains under a 
microscope, they would look like tiny bubbles; hence the name, bubble memory.
