When the torque-speed characteristics of a conventional ac induction motor need to be modiÔ¨Åed, the wound
rotor induction motor is used. These motors replace the squirrel cage rotor with a wound rotor and slip rings.
External resistors are used to adjust the torque-speed characteristics for speed control in such applications as
ac cranes, hoists, and elevators.
