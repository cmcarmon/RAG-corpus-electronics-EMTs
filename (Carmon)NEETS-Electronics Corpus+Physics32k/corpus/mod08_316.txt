Even though this circuit is designed to have two inputs and two outputs, it is not necessary to use
both inputs and both outputs. (Remember, a differential amplifier was defined as having two possible
inputs and two possible outputs.) A differential amplifier can be connected as a single-input, single-output
device; a single-input, differential-output device; or a differential-input, differential-output device.
