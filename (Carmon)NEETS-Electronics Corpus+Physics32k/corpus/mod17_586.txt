The tropo system uses the turbulence in the layer between the troposphere and the stratosphere to 
bounce signals back to earth. This method provides several hops and communications beyond los. The 
propagation reliability and communications capability is the same. The transmission range is up to 800 
kilometers (500 statute miles). Transmitter output power may be up to 75 kilowatts depending on the 
operational requirements. The antennas are horn-driven paraboloids and may be as large as 50 to 60 feet 
in diameter. Figure 5-9 shows a typical tropospheric-scanner antenna. Remember that hf has a hop 
distance (skywave) of about 1,400 miles; the distance of one hop for a line-of-sight system is between 31 
and 95 miles. The tropospheric-scatter system conveniently fills the gap between these distances.
