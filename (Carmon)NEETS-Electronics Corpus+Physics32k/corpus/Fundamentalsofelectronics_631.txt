In fact, we will discover that frequency-domain implementation of systems, wherein we multiply the input
signal’s Fourier transform by a frequency response, is not only a viable alternative, but also a computationally
eﬃcient one. We begin with discussing the underlying mathematical structure of linear, shift-invariant
systems, and devise how software ﬁlters can be constructed.
