applied). The effect of providing negative feedback 
is to reduce the loop voltage gain to a value that is 
both predictable and manageable. Practical closed-
loop  voltage  gains  range  from  one  to  several 
thousand but note that high values of voltage gain 
may make unacceptable restrictions on bandwidth, 
see later.  
  Closed-loop voltage gain is once again the ratio 
of output voltage to input voltage but with negative 
feedback is applied, hence:
