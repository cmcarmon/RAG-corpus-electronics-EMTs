average, the same time on each atom. This corresponds to a
purely homopolar (covalent) bond. In a compound semicon-
ductor, such as GaAs, bonding electrons spend a greater frac-
tion of time on the anions (i. e., negatively charged atoms).
This situation corresponds to a partially heteropolar (partially
ionic) bond.
