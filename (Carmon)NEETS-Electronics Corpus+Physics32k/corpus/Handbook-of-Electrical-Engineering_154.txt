Y Connection (Fig. 1.25)
In the Y connection, one end of each of the three windings is connected together
to form a  Y, or a neutral point. This point is normally grounded, which limits
the maximum potential to ground in the transformer to the line to neutral voltage
of the power system. The grounded neutral also limits transient overvoltages in
the transformer when subjected to lightning or switching surges. Availability of
the  neutral  point  allows  the  transformer  to  supply  line  to  neutral  single-phase
loads  in  addition  to  normal  three-phase  loads.  Each  phase  of  the Y-connected
winding must be designed to carry the full line current, whereas the phase voltages
are only 57.7% of the line voltages.
