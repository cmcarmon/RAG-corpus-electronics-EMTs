to the ﬁn base. In the analysis of such ﬁnned surfaces, it is thus common to deﬁne a ﬁn efﬁciency, h, equal to
the ratio of the average temperature rise of the ﬁn (above the coolant) to the temperature rise of the ﬁn base.
Using this approach, heat transfer by a ﬁn or ﬁn structure can be expressed in the form
