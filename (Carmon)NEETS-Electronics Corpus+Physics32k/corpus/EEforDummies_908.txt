The holes in a solderless breadboard aren’t just ordinary holes; they are 
contact holes with copper lines running underneath so that components 
plugged into two or more holes within a particular row are connected below 
the surface of the breadboard. You plug in your discrete components (resis-
tors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors) and integrated circuits (ICs) in just 
the right way, and — voilà — you have a connected circuit without soldering. 
When you’re tired of the circuit, you can simply remove the parts and build 
something else using the same breadboard.
