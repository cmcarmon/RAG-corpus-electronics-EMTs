It 
describes and explains the use of the basic items of 
test equipment that you will find in any electronics 
laboratory  or  workshop.  We  begin  the  chapter  by 
looking  at  how  we  use  a  moving  coil  meter  to 
measure  voltage,  current  and  resistance  and  then 
quickly  move  on  to  more  complex  multi-range 
analogue 
the 
oscilloscope.  To  help  you  make  use  of  these  test 
instruments  we  have  included  some  DO’s  and 
DONT’S.  If  you  intend  to  become  an  electronic 
engineer  these  will  become  your  ‘tools  of  the 
trade’. Being able to use them effectively is just the 
first step on the ladder!
