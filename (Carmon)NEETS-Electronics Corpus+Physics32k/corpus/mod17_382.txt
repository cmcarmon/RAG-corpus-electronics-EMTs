Each panel contains six channels. Each channel has its own series circuit of looping jacks, set jacks, 
and a rheostat for adjusting line current. The number of looping and set jacks in each channel varies with 
the panel model. Each panel includes a meter and rotary selector switch for measuring the line current in 
any channel. There are six miscellaneous jacks. Any tty equipment not regularly assigned to a channel, 
may be connected to one of these jacks.
