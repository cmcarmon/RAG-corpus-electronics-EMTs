range indication. On the 2 V range, the instrument 
has a resolution of 0.001 V (or 1 mV). The lowest 
range of the instrument is 200 mV (corresponding 
to a maximum display of 199.9 mV) and thus the 
meter has a sensitivity of 0.1 mV (or 100 µV). 
  Nearly  all  digital  meters  have  automatic  zero 
and  polarity  indicating  facilities  and  some  also 
have  autoranging. This  feature,  which  is  only 
found 
instruments, 
automatically  changes  the  range  setting  so  that 
maximum  resolution  is  obtained  without  over-
ranging.  There  is  thus  no  need  for  manual 
operation  of  the  range  switch  once  the  indicating 
mode  has  been  selected.  This  is  an  extremely 
useful facility since it  frees  you from the  need to 
make  repeated  adjustments  to  the  range  switch 
while measurements are being made. 
 
Example 14.5 
 
A digital multi-range meter has a 4½-digit display. 
When switched to the 200 V range, determine: 
 
(a)   the  maximum  indication  that  will  appear  on 
 
(b)   the resolution of the instrument. 
 
Solution 
 
(a)   The  maximum  indication  that  will  appear  on 
 
(b)   The resolution of the instrument will be 0.01 V
