interpretation of this result is often helpful. As shown in
Figure 4.37, Equation 4.61 is the straight line passing through the DC operating
point VD, ID and tangent to the curve at that point. The higher order terms in
Equation 4.58 that we neglected would add quadratic, cubic, etc., terms to the
model, thereby improving the fit over a wider region.
