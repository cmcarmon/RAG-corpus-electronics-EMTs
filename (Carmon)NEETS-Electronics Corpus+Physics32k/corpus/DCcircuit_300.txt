With two hands, the bodily contact area is twice as great as with one hand. This is an im-
portant lesson to learn: electrical resistance between any contacting objects diminishes with
increased contact area, all other factors being equal. With two hands holding the pipe, elec-
trons have two, parallel routes through which to ï¬‚ow from the pipe to the body (or vice-versa).
