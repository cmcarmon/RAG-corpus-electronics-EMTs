The ﬁrst and most straightforward network analysis technique is called the Branch Current
Method. In this method, we assume directions of currents in a network, then write equations
describing their relationships to each other through Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s Laws. Once we
have one equation for every unknown current, we can solve the simultaneous equations and
determine all currents, and therefore all voltage drops in the network.
