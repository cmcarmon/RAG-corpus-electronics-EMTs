A typical operational link involves an active satellite and two or more earth terminals. One station 
transmits to the satellite on a frequency called the UP-LINK frequency. The satellite then amplifies the 
signal, converts it to the DOWN-LINK frequency, and transmits it back to earth. The signal is next picked 
up by the receiving terminal. Figure 4-1 shows a satellite handling several combinations of links 
simultaneously.
