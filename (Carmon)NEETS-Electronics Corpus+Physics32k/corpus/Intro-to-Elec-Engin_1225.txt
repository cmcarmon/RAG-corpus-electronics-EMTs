The generating units in these WECSs are commonly the induction and synchronous generators.
Constant shaft-speed operation requires more complex and expensive mechanical and/or
hydraulic control systems for accurate control of the shaft speed. This is usually accomplished by
controlling the turbine blades. Since the turbine operates with a low efÔ¨Åciency for wind speeds
other than the rated speed, only a small portion of the available wind energy is extracted. Hence
variable-shaft-speed systems have been developed.
