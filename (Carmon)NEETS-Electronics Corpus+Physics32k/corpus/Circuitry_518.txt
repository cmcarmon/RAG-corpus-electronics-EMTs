Data storage 
 
The  semiconductor  ROM  within  a  microprocessor 
system  provides  storage  for  the  program  code  as 
well  as  any  permanent  data  that  requires  storage. 
All  of  this  data  is  referred  to  as  non-volatile 
because it remains intact when the power supply is 
disconnected. 
a 
  The 
microprocessor  system  provides  storage  for  the 
transient  data  and  variables  that  are  used  by 
programs. Part of the RAM is also be used by the 
microprocessor as a temporary store for data whilst 
carrying out its normal processing tasks. 
 
It is important to note that any program or data 
stored in RAM will be lost when the power supply 
is switched off or disconnected. The only exception 
to this is CMOS RAM that is kept alive by means 
of a small battery. This battery-backed memory is 
used to retain important data, such as the time and 
date. 
  When expressing the amount of storage provided 
by  a  memory  device  we  usually  use  Kilobytes 
(Kbyte).  It  is  important  to  note  that  a  Kilobyte  of 
memory  is  actually  1,024  bytes  (not  1,000  bytes). 
The reason for choosing the  Kbyte rather than the 
kbyte (1,000 bytes) is that 1,024 happens to be the 
nearest power of 2 (note that 210 = 1,024). 
  The capacity of a semiconductor ROM is usually 
specified  in  terms  of  an  address  range  and  the 
number of bits stored at each address. For example, 
2 K × 8 bits  (capacity  2  Kbytes),  4  K  ×  8  bits 
(capacity 4 Kbytes), and so on. Note that it  is  not 
always  necessary  (or  desirable)  for  the  entire 
memory space of a microprocessor to be populated 
by memory devices.
