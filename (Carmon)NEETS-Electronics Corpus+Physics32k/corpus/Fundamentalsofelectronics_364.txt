Also note the presence of a linear phase term (the ﬁrst term in ∠ck is proportional to frequency k/T ).
Comparing this term with that predicted from delaying a signal, a delay of ∆/2 is present in our signal.
Advancing the signal by this amount centers the pulse about the origin, leaving an even signal, which in
turn means that its spectrum is real-valued. Thus, our calculated spectrum is consistent with the properties
of the Fourier spectrum.
