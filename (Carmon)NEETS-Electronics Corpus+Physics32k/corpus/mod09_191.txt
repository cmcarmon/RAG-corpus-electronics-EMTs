Figure 1-23, (view A) (view B) and (view C), and figure 1-24, (view A) (view B) and (view C) 
depict some of the common configurations of the T- and pi-type filters. Further discussion about the 
theory of operation of these circuits is beyond the intended scope of this module. If you are interested in 
learning more about filters, a good source of information to study is the Electronics Installation and 
Maintenance Handbook (EIMB), section 4 (Electronics Circuits), NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0120.
