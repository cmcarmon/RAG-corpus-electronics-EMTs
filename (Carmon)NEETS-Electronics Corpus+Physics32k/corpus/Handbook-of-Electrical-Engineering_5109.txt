To read the stored information optically, the Kerr effect is used to detect the presence of these very small
magnetic domains within the MO layer. When a low-power polarized laser beam is reﬂected by the perpen-
dicularly oriented MO medium, the polarization angle is twisted through a small angle qk, the Kerr rotation.
Furthermore, the direction of this twist is either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the orientation
of  the  perpendicular  magnetic  moment,  which  is  either  upward  or  downward.  Therefore,  as  the  read  beam
scans across an oppositely magnetized domain from the surrounding medium, there is a total change of 2qk in
the polarization directions from the reﬂected beam coming from the two distinct regions. Reading is done by
detecting this phase difference.
