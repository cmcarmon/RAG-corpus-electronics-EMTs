At this point we still don’t know what the total current or total resistance for this parallel
circuit is, so we can’t apply Ohm’s Law to the rightmost (”Total”) column. However, if we think
carefully about what is happening it should become apparent that the total current must equal
the sum of all individual resistor (”branch”) currents:
