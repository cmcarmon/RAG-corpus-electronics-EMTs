Insufficient detection range in a radar system can be caused by decreased sensitivity in the radar 
receiver. This condition results mainly from the great number of adjustments and components associated 
with the receiver. A decrease of receiver sensitivity has the same effect on range performance as does a 
decrease of transmitter power. For example, a 6 dB loss of receiver sensitivity shortens the effective range 
of a radar just as much as a 6 dB loss in transmitter power. Such a drop in transmitter power is evident 
and is easy to detect. On the other hand, a 6 dB loss in receiver sensitivity, which can easily result from a 
slight misadjustment in the receiver, is difficult to detect unless accurate measurements are made.
