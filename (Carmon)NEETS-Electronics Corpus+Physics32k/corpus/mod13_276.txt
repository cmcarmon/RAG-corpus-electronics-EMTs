Boolean logic, or Boolean algebra as it is called today, was developed by an English mathematician,
George Boole, in the 19th century. He based his concepts on the assumption that most quantities have two
possible conditions Â¾ TRUE and FALSE. This is the same theory you were introduced to at the
beginning of this chapter.
