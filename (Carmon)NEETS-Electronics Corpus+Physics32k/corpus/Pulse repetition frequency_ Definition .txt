Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is the number of times a pulsed activity occurs every second.
This is similar to cycle per second used to describe other types of waveforms.
PRF has a pulse period,




T



{\displaystyle \mathrm {T} }
, which is the time between pulses.

{\displaystyle \mathrm {T} ={\frac {1}{\text{PRF}}}}

PRF is usually associated with pulse spacing, which is the distance that the pulse travels before the next pulse occurs.
