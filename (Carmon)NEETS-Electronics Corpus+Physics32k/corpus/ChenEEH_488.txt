The maximum frequency of oscillation, fmax, depends on the
power gain chosen for its extraction. According to theory,
though, the magnitude of only the unilateral power gain, GU ,
is expected to show a 20 dB per decade decrease in frequency in
a certain frequency range. In practice, a deviation of GU (and
also of jbj) from this ideal behavior occurs at higher frequen-
cies due to parasitics, such as CBC and nonquasistatic effects
(TeWinkel, 1973; Schro¨ter and Rein, 1995). From GU , the
following equation can be derived for CE conﬁguration
(Armstrong and French, 1995):
