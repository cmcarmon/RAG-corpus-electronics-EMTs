(cid:1) The Norton equivalent circuit contains a current source in parallel with a
resistor. The element value for the Norton equivalent current source can
be found by calculating or measuring at the designated terminal pair on the
original network the short circuit current. As with the Thévenin equivalent
resistance, the Norton equivalent resistance can be calculated or measured
as the resistance of the network seen from the designated terminal pair with
all independent sources internal to the network set to zero. Note that the
value of the equivalent resistance is the same for the Thévenin and Norton
equivalent circuits, that is, RTH = RN.
Since the Thévenin equivalent voltage vTH, the Norton equivalent current
iN, and the equivalent resistance RTH = RN are related as
