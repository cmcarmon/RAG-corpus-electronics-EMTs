We now discuss several new architecture models: Integrated
Services (IntServ), Differentiated Services (DiffServ), and
Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). These have been pro-
posed for the best-effort Internet to satisfy the trafÔ¨Åc require-
ments of distributed multimedia applications. But, before
delving into the discussion of these QoS service models pro-
posed for the Internet, we would like to summarize some of
the principles that are common to all of them and are also
expected to be seen in any future proposals.
