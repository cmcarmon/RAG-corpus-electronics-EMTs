The system does, of course, have some distortion introduced by quantizing the signal. Both the
standard values selected and the sampling interval tend to make the reconstructed wave depart from the
original. This distortion, called QUANTIZING NOISE, is initially introduced at the quantizing and
coding modulator and remains fixed throughout the transmission and retransmission processes. Its
magnitude can be reduced by making the standard quantizing levels closer together. The relationship of
the quantizing noise to the number of digits in the binary code is given by the following standard
relationship:
