Ultrabroadband components can be designed with long or
multisectioned inhomogeneous and nonuniform tapered
coupled lines as described by the example of Figure 7.22(E).
In the case of a continuously and gradually tapered line cou-
pler, its operating bandwidth can be easily extended by several
octaves. The design is usually made for the upper frequency
range in the bandwidth of the coupler.
