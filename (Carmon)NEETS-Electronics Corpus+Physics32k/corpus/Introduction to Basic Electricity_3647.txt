With a full-wave rectifier, the current flows during 
both half-cycles. This means that the ripple frequency 
is twice the input frequency. There is a disadvantage 
with the full-wave rectifier because the output voltage 
is half that of a half-wave rectifier for the same trans-
former. This disadvantage can be overcome by the use 
of a bridge rectifier circuit.
