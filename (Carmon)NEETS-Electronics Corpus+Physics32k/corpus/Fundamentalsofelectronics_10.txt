1.1 Themes1
From its beginnings in the late nineteenth century, electrical engineering has blossomed from focusing on
electrical circuits for power, telegraphy and telephony to focusing on a much broader range of disciplines.
However, the underlying themes are relevant today: Power creation and transmission and information
have been the underlying themes of electrical engineering for a century and a half. This course concentrates
on the latter theme: the representation, manipulation, transmission, and reception of information
by electrical means. This course describes what information is, how engineers quantify information, and
how electrical signals represent information.
