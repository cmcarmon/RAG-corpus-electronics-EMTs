Electron band: A range or band of energies in which there is a continuum (rather than a discrete set as in,
for example, the hydrogen atom) of allowed quantum mechanical states partially or fully occupied by
electrons. It is the continuous nature of these states that permits them to respond almost classically to
an applied electric Ô¨Åeld.
