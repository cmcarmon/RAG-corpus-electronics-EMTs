Getting direct current from a battery
A battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy through a process 
called an electrochemical reaction. When two different metals are immersed in 
certain chemicals, the metal atoms react with the chemical atoms to produce 
charged atoms, known as ions. As you see in Figure 1-7, negative ions build up on 
one metal plate, known as an electrode, while positive ions build up on the other 
electrode. The difference in charge across the two electrodes creates a voltage. 
That voltage is the force that electrons need to push them around a circuit.
