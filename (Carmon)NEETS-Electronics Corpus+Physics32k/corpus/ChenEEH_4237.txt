The second way and the most frequent way an IEEE 802.11
network architecture can be conÔ¨Ågured is by the basic service
set (BSS), also often referred to as an infrastructure network
(see Figure 6.6). In an infrastructure network, one station,
called an access point (AP), acts as a central station for each
cell, and many overlapping cells can make up a network. If
there is more than one cell, the network is actually called an
extended service set (ESS), and each cell is actually considered
a basic service set (BSS) (see Figure 6.7). In an ESS, each BSS is
connected together by means of a distribution system (DS). So
these types of networks can have one or more access points.
These access points serve as an ethernet bridge between the
wireless LAN and a wired network infrastructure. These access
points are not mobile and are considered part of the wired
network infrastructure. The wireless stations can be mobile
and can roam from one cell to the next, allowing for seamless
coverage throughout the whole service area of the ESS.
