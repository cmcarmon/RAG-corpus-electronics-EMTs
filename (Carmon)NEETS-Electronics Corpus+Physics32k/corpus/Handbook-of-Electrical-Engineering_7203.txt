Personal Communication Service Systems
In June 1990, the FCC started to ask the wireless communication industry to study the development of future
personal  communication  service  (PCS)  systems.  (In  late  1994,  the  FCC  started  to  auction  off  two  of  the  six
spectral  bands  for  over  7  billion  dollars.  In  1996,  Band  C  was  auctioned  off  for  over  4  billion  dollars.)  PCS
systems need to have more capacity than cellular systems. The technologies of increasing the capacity not only
apply to GSM, but also apply to CDMA (code division multiple access) and the new microcell system.
