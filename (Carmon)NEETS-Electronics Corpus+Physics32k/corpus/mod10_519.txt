The voltage at the center and the ends varies at a sinusoidal rate between the limits shown. At the
one-fourth the three-fourths points, the voltage is always zero. A continuous series of diagrams such as
these is difficult to see with conventional test equipment, which reads the effective or average voltage
over several cycles. The curve of amplitude over the length of line for several cycles is shown in figure
3-29, view B. A meter will read zero at the points shown and will show a maximum voltage at the center,
no matter how many cycles pass.
