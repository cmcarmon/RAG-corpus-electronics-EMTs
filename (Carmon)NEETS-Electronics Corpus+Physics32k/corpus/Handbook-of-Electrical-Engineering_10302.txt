The communications subsystem consists of receiver and transmitter sections. The receiver system consists
of wideband redundant units. The transmitter subsystem consists of separate ampliﬁers (transponders) for each
channel  utilized.  Satellite  systems  make  use  of  orthogonal  polarized  signals  in  order  to  transmit  two  signals
simultaneously  on  the  same  frequency,  a  technique  known  as “frequency  reuse.”  Two  different  polarization
methods  for  signals  are  used:  horizontal  and  vertical  linear  polarization,  or  clockwise  and  counterclockwise
circular polarization.
