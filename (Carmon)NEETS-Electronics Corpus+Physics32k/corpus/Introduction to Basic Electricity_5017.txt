Proper placement of traces is something that 
is learned through practice. The only way to do it 
is to actually hand-route printed circuit boards. A 
 common and effective technique is to run  horizontal 
traces on one layer and vertical traces on the other 
layer. Obviously, this doesnâ€™t work for single-layer 
boards. This tends to create boards with a lot of 
vias. A via is a plated through-hole used to pass a 
 conductor from one side of the printed circuit board 
to the other.
