Most antennas transmit only one polarization of electromagnetic wave. That is to say, the
electric ﬁeld of the propagating wave is oriented with respect to the antenna in only one direction.
The main lobe in most antennas is directed normal to the plane of the aperture. For phased-array
antennas, however, the main lobe is electronically steered to other angles away from the so-called
broadside. Figure 15.1.10 illustrates vertical, horizontal, and arbitrarily linear polarizations of
the electric ﬁeld. In Figure 15.1.10(a), with the electric ﬁeld lying in the vertical plane, the
radiation is said to be vertically polarized. With the electric ﬁeld being in the horizontal plane,
as in Figure 15.1.10(b), the radiation is said to be horizontally polarized. Since both vertical and
horizontal polarizations are simply special cases of linear polarization, the electric ﬁeld, having
both horizontal and vertical components (that are in time phase), can still be in a plane, as shown
in Figure 15.1.10(c).
