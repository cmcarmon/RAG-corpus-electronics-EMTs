does not return the magnetic tape to its neutral state in between pulses. The magnetic tape is always in
saturation, either positively or negatively. The polarity of the saturating signal only changes when
incoming data changes from a zero to a one and vice versa. Figure 7-4 shows how the digital data word
101100011010 is stored onto the magnetic tape using the NRZ encoding method.
