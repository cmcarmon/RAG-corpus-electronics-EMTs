The Gantt chart is a display that shows activities on a horizontal bar graph in which the bars represent the time of the activity. Below is an example of a Gantt chart for the process in the example described above.
Another time chart which is also sometimes called a Gantt chart shows the time during which key resources, e.g. equipment, are occupied. The previous figures show this occupancy-style Gantt chart.
Resources that are consumed on a rate basis, e.g. electrical power, steam or labor, are generally displayed as consumption rate vs time plots.
