Summary and Conclusions
The availability of general-purpose and application-speciÔ¨Åc digital signal processing chips and the ever-widening
interest in digital communications have led to an increasing demand for speech coders. The worldwide desire
to  establish  standards  in  a  host  of  applications  is  a  primary  driving  force  for  speech  coder  research  and
development. The speech coders that are available today for operation at 16 kbits/s and below are conceptually
quite exotic compared with products available less than 10 years ago. The re-standardization of U.S. Federal
Standard 1015 (LPC-10) at 2.4 kbits/s with performance constraints similar to those of FS-1016 at 4.8 kbits/s
is an indicator of the rapid evolution of speech coding paradigms and VLSI architectures.
