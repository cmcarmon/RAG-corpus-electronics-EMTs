then enter the BC SCR, where they are pulled toward the
collector with high velocity. Since in today’s processes, recom-
bination of minorities (electrons in this case) in the base can
be neglected, the (1-D) current IC at the collector (x ¼ xc)
equals the current injected into the base and,
for useful
bias conditions VB0E0 , even the current entering the BE SCR
at the emitter side; this current component is often called
