An acquisition time TS is allowed for the synchronization circuits to lock to the incoming signal. The recovered
basis functions ˆg1(t) and ˆg2(t) are then correlated with ri(t) for the remainder of the bit duration T. A decision
is made on the basis of the relative closeness of ri(t) to ˆg1(t) and ˆg2(t), as quantiﬁed by the observation variables
zi1 and zi2, respectively.
