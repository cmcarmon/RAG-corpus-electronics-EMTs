We will ﬁrst consider the transient response. This will be one of the few times we consider
non-oscillating AC behaviour. Since Ohm’s law and Kirchoﬀ’s laws are linear we can use
complex exponential signals and take real or imaginary parts in the end. This is not true
for power, since it is non-linear (product of signals).
