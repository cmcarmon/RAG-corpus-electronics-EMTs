The value selected from the graph means that a capacitor (including the one you are solving for) will
reach twenty percent of full charge in twenty-two one hundredths (.22) of one RC time constant. Remember
that it takes 100 µs for the capacitor to reach 20% of full charge. Since 100 µs is equal to .22 RC (twenty-
two one-hundredths), then the time required to reach one RC time constant must be equal to:
