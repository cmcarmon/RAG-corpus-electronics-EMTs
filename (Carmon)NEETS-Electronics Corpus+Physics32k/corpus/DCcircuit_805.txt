No text on electrical metering could be called complete without a section on bridge circuits.
These ingenious circuits make use of a null-balance meter to compare two voltages, just like
the laboratory balance scale compares two weights and indicates when they’re equal. Unlike
the ”potentiometer” circuit used to simply measure an unknown voltage, bridge circuits can be
used to measure all kinds of electrical values, not the least of which being resistance.
