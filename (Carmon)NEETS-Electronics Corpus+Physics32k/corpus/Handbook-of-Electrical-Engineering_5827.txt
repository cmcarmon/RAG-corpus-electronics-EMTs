 is rated two-thirds of the total average reactive load and installed
two-thirds of the distance out on the feeder from the source. The capacitor bank improves the power factor
and  reduces  voltage  drop  at  heavy  loads.  However,  at  light  loads,  the  capacitor  is  switched  off  to  avoid
overvoltages.
