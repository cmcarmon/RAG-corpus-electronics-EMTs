At T1 the 35 volts across the capacitor is series aiding with the +25 volt input signal. At this point 
(T1) the output voltage becomes +60 volts; the voltage across R1 and D1 is +50 volts, and the battery is 
+10 volts. The cathode of D1 is positive with respect to the anode and the diode does not conduct. From 
T1 to T2, C1 discharges only slightly through the large resistance of R1. Assume that, because of the size 
of R1 and C1, the capacitor discharges just 2 volts (from +35 volts to +33 volts) during this period. Thus, 
the output voltage drops from +60 volts to +58 volts.
