Capacitors designed for DC circuits are typically rated for a WV of no more 
than 16 V to 35 V. That’s plenty for DC circuits that are powered by sources 
ranging from 3.3 V to 12 V. If you build circuits that use higher voltages, be 
sure to select a capacitor that has a WV of at least 10% to 15% more than the 
supply voltage in your circuit, just to be on the safe side.
