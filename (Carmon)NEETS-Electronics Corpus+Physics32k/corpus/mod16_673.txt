Most dual-trace oscilloscopes have both an A and B time base for horizontal sweep control. Notice
in the upper right corner on our example scope (figure 6-34) the COUPLING, SOURCE LEVEL, and
SLOPE controls. These serve the same function as did those same controls in the A time-base section of
the scope. The B time base is selected using the same A and B TIME/DIV control (pull out outer knob).
