If you were designing a circuit for maximum power dissipation at the load resistance, this
theorem would be very useful. Having reduced a network down to a Thevenin voltage and
resistance (or Norton current and resistance), you simply set the load resistance equal to that
Thevenin or Norton equivalent (or vice versa) to ensure maximum power dissipation at the
load. Practical applications of this might include radio transmitter ﬁnal ampliﬁer stage design
(seeking to maximize power delivered to the antenna or transmission line), a grid tied inverter
loading a solar array, or electric vehicle design (seeking to maximize power delivered to drive
motor).
