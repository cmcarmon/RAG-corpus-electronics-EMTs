Inductors used in tuning circuits are shielded so that the magnetic field they 
produce doesn’t interact with other circuit components. Unshielded coils are 
sometimes placed close to one another for the express purpose of allowing 
their magnetic fields to interact. In this section, I describe how unshielded 
coils interact — and how you can exploit their interaction to do some useful 
things with an electronic device known as a transformer.
