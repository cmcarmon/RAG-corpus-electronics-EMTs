Feedback control theory developed to address the problem of parasitic oscillation in servo control systems – the system oscillated rather than performing their intended function, for example velocity control in engines. The Barkhausen stability criterion gives the necessary condition for oscillation; the loop gain around the feedback loop, which is equal to the amplifier gain multiplied by the transfer function of the inadvertent feedback path, must be equal to one, and the phase shift around the loop must be zero or a multiple of 360° (2π radians).
In practice, feedback may occur over a range of frequencies (for example the operating range of an amplifier); at various frequencies, the phase of the amplifier may be different. If there is one frequency where the feedback is positive and the amplitude condition is also fulfilled – the system will oscillate at that frequency.
These conditions can be expressed in mathematical terms using the Nyquist plot. Another method used in control loop theory uses Bode plots of gain and phase vs. frequency. Using Bode plots, a design engineer checks whether there is a frequency where both conditions for oscillations are met: the phase is zero (positive feedback) and the loop gain is 1 or greater.
When parasitic oscillations occur, the designer can use the various tools of control loop engineering to correct the situation – to reduce the gain or to change the phase at problematic frequencies.
