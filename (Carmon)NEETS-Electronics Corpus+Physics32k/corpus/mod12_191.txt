The vector analysis of the modulation envelope will be developed with the aid of figure 1-44. In 
figure 1-44, view (A), a vertical vector (C) has been drawn to represent the carrier wave in figure 1-43. At 
T1 in figure 1-43, the upper and lower sideband frequencies are of opposite phase with respect to each 
other, and 90 degrees out of phase with respect to the carrier. This condition is illustrated in figure 1-44, 
view (A), by sideband vectors U and L drawn in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. Since the 
upper sideband U is equal in amplitude but opposite in phase to lower sideband L, the two sideband 
voltages cancel one another; the amplitude of the envelope at T1 is equal to the amplitude of the carrier. 
The same vector diagram is shown on a smaller scale in figure 1-43, view (E).
