Exercise 5.17
(Solution on p. 192.)
In making the complexity evaluation for the DFT, we assumed the data to be real. Three questions
emerge. First of all, the spectra of such signals have conjugate symmetry, meaning that negative
in the DFT (5.33)) can be computed from the
frequency components (k =
corresponding positive frequency components. Does this symmetry change the DFT’s complexity?
Secondly, suppose the data are complex-valued; what is the DFT’s complexity now? Finally, a less
important but interesting question is suppose we want K frequency values instead of N; now what
is the complexity?
