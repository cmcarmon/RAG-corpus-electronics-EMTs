There have also been designs proposed that can correct a
single error, and these are classiÔ¨Åed as one-fault tolerant
(1-FT). These designs arise by using fault masking as in
error-correcting RESO (Laha and Patel, 1983) and triple
modular redundancy (TMR) (Johnson, 1989), using a hybrid
redundancy scheme as in partitioned TMR (PTMR) (Arian
and Gumusel, 1992; Chen et al., 1992; Hsu and Swartzlander,
1992), or using arithmetic codes (Rao, 1971). In such schemes,
the circuit can still operate correctly in the presence of a single
permanent fault but will become useless when a second per-
manent fault occurs.
