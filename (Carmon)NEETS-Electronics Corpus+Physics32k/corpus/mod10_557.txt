 0. Therefore, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum is a
measure of the perfection of the termination of a line. This ratio is called the STANDING-WAVE RATIO
(swr) and is always expressed in whole numbers. For example, a ratio of 1:1 describes a line terminated in
its characteristic impedance (Z
