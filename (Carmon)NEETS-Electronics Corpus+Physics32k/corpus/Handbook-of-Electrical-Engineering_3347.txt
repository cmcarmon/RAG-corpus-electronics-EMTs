The technological signiﬁcance of integrated optics stems from its natural compatibility with two other rapidly
expanding  technologies:  ﬁber  optics  and  semiconductor  laser  diodes.  These  technologies  have  moved  in  the
past 10 years from laboratory curiosities to large-scale commercial ventures. Integrated optic devices typically
use  laser  diode  optical  sources,  diode-pumped  yttrium,  aluminum,  garnet  (YAG)  lasers,  and  transmit  the
modiﬁed optical output on a single-mode optical ﬁber. Integrated optic devices are typically very high speed,
compact, and require only moderate control voltages compared to their bulk-optical counterparts.
