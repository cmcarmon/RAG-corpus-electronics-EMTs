Solar Two uses 1,926 heliostats (mirrors) located on a ﬁeld in circular formation around a 300-ft tower to
focus sunlight on a central receiver which generates a clean, inexhaustible supply of energy. The heliostats are
equipped with two dual-axis electrical motors that position the mirrors to reﬂect the most sunlight onto the
receiver via a computerized program.
