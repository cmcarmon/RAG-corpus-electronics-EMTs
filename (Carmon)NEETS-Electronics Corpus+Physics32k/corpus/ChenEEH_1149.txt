actuators have been used to move pumps and valves in micro-
ﬂuidic systems. The small forces available from most MEMS
actuators limit
the pressures that can be developed and
switched and also limit the ﬂow rates, but the performance
is adequate for small-scale analytical systems, notably the ‘‘lab
on a chip.’’
