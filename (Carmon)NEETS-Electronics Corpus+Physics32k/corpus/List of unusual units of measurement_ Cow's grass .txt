In Ireland, before the 19th Century, a "cow's grass" was a measurement used by farmers to indicate the size of their fields. A cow's grass was equal to the amount of land that could produce enough grass to support a cow.
A variation called a "cow field" is still often used in the British Channel Islands, particularly Guernsey where classified advertisements in the local newspaper (Guernsey Press) for land can be seen referring to "A plot of land measuring X cow fields". This is probably still used because an acre of land in Guernsey is rather unusual due to the small size of the island and therefore a cow-field is a more suitable unit of measurement.
