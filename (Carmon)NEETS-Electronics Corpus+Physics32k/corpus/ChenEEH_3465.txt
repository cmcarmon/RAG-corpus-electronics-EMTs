The current differential protection principle is most com-
monly used to protect against phase faults on the stator,
which are the most common faults. Other conditions require
other principles to be used. The loss of ﬁeld and the ground
protection of the rotor are quite complex and depend on the
type of the grounding and current sensing arrangement used.
This subject is well beyond the basic considerations and is
treated in a variety of specialized literature (IEEE, 1995).
Protection from the abnormal generator operating condition
requires the use of relaying principles based on detection of the
changes in voltage, current, power, or frequency. A reverse
power relay is used to protect against loss of a prime mover
known as generator motoring, which is a dangerous condition
since it can cause damage of the turbine and turbine blades. In
addition, synchronous generators should not be subjected to
an overvoltage. With normal operation near the knee of the
iron saturation curve, small overvoltages result in excessive
ﬂux densities and abnormal ﬂux patterns, which can cause
extensive structural damage in the machine. A relaying
principle based on the ratio between voltage and frequency,
called a volt-per-hertz principle, is used to detect this condi-
tion. An inadvertent connection of the generator to the power
system not meeting the synchronization requirements can
also cause damage. The overcurrent relaying principle in com-
bination with the reverse power principle are used to detect
such conditions. The overload conditions as well as over-
and under-frequency operations can cause damage from
overheating, and thermal relays in combination with frequency
relays are used. Undervoltage and overvoltage protections
are used for detecting loss of synchronism and overvoltage
conditions.
