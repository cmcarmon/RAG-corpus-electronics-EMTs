In figure 1, u = 2 and v = 2 m/s everywhere so the velocity field is uniform and parallel to the diagonal (XX). The boundary conditions for temperature on north and west wall is 100 ̊C and for east and south wall is 0 ̊C. This region is meshed into 10×10 equal grids. Take two cases, (i) with diffusion coefficient ≠ 0 and, case (ii) with diffusion coefficient = 0.
