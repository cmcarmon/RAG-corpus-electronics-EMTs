RESULTANT REACTANCE X = (XL − X C) or X = (XC − XL). XL is usually plotted above the 
reference line and X C below the reference line. Inductance and capacitance have opposite effects on the 
current in respect to the voltage in a.c. circuits. Below resonance, XC is larger than XL, and the series 
circuit appears capacitive. Above resonance, XL is larger than XC, and the series circuit appears inductive. 
At resonance, XL = XC, and the total impedance of the circuit is resistive.
