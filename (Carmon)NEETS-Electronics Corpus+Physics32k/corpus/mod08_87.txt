Direct coupling has several disadvantages, however. The major problem is the power supply 
requirements for direct-coupled amplifiers. Each succeeding stage requires a higher voltage. The load and 
voltage divider resistors use a large amount of power and the biasing can become very complicated. In 
addition, it is difficult to match the impedance from stage to stage with direct coupling. (Impedance 
matching is covered a little later in this chapter.)
