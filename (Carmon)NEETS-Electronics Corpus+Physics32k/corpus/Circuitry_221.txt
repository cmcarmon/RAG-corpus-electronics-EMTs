Adjust  the  signal  generator  output  voltage  so  that 
the  voltmeter  reads  exactly  1  V  before  measuring 
and recording the current. Repeat this measurement 
at 
to  
1 kHz in steps of 100 Hz. At each step, check that 
the  voltage  is  exactly  1  V  (adjust,  if  necessary). 
Note  the  frequency  at  which  the  current  takes  a 
minimum value.
