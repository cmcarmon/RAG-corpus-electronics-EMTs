Waveshaping with C–R networks 
 
One  of  the  most  common  applications  of  C–R 
networks  is  in  waveshaping  circuits.  The  circuits 
shown  in  Figs  3.33  and  3.35  function  as  simple 
square-to-triangle  and  square-to-pulse  converters 
by,  respectively,  integrating  and  differentiating
