As  shown  in  Fig.  3.23(b),  we  create  a  supermesh  as  the  periphery  of
the  two  meshes  and  treat  it  differently.  (If  a  circuit  has  two  or  more
supermeshes  that  intersect,  they  should  be  combined  to  form  a  larger
supermesh.) Why treat the supermesh differently? Because mesh analy-
sis applies KVL—which requires that we know the voltage across each
branch—and  we  do  not  know  the  voltage  across  a  current  source  in
advance. However, a supermesh must satisfy KVL like any other mesh.
Therefore, applying KVL to the supermesh in Fig. 3.23(b) gives
