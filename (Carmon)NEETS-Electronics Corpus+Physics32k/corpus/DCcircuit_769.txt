It should be noted that hi-pot testers and even meggers (in certain conditions) are capable of
damaging wire insulation if incorrectly used. Once an insulating material has been subjected
to breakdown by the application of an excessive voltage, its ability to electrically insulate will
be compromised. Again, these instruments are to be used only by trained personnel.
