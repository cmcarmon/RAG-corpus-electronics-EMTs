As a ﬁnal note, observe that the solution described by equa-
tions 4.63 and 4.64 is not only a stationary point of the
Lagrangian function L(s, l) (i.e., a potential local minimizer),
but the solution is also a global minimizer of e in equation
4.54 (Bjo¨rck, 1996). As a matter of fact, problem QP-3 belongs
to a broader class of optimization problems for which the
function being minimized is of the form f (x) ¼ xt Zx þ yt x
(note that in the case of problem QP-3, the matrix Z is the
positive-deﬁnite identity matrix Ip). A proof can be found in
(Bjo¨rck, 1996): if Z is positive-deﬁnite, a solution process
similar to the process represented by equations 4.55 through
4.64 can be applied to obtain a unique global minimizer of
f (x) ¼ xt Zx þ yt x. Bjo¨rck (1996) provides a most thorough
treatment of this subject as well as proofs of the existence and
uniqueness of the solution.
