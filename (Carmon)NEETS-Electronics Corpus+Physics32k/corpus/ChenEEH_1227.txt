Shield insertion is another technique for decreasing cross talk.
It simply adds a power or a ground line between already
existing wires. These power lines act like shields and can isolate
between wires. Figure 8.9 shows the effect of adding shields of
different sizes on the noise amplitude. As the shield width
increases, the noise amplitude decreases. The result is an ef-
fective technique specially made to eliminate inductive noise;
however, it consumes more area.
