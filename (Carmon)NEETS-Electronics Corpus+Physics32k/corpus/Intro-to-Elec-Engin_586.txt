a detailed knowledge of the computer structure, is rather tedious and error-prone. Assembly-
language programming is developed by using symbolic names, known as mnemonics, and
matching machine-language instructions on a more or less one-for-one basis. An assembler
is then used to translate assembly-language programs into their equivalent machine-language
programs. Because both assembly-language and machine-language programmings are speciÔ¨Åc
to a particular computer, high-level languages (HLL) such as Fortran, Pascal, Basic, LISP, and
C have been developed such that programs written by using them could be run on virtually any
computer. Also, these are problem-oriented languages, which allow the user to write programs in
forms that are as close as possible to the human-oriented languages.
