Figure 36-27 shows a feedback voltage regulator 
circuit. Resistors R3, R4, and R5 form the sampling cir-
cuit. Transistor Q2 acts as both the error-detection and 
error-amplification circuits. Zener diode D1 and resis-
tor R1 produce the reference voltage. Transistor Q1 is 
the series regulator transistor. Resistor R2 is the collec-
tor load resistor for transistor Q2 and the biasing resis-
tor for transistor Q1.
