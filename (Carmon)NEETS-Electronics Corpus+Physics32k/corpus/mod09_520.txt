Ideally, the output wave shape should be exactly the same as the input wave shape with only the 
limited portion removed. When the diode is reverse biased, the circuit has a small amount of reverse 
current flow, as shown just above the 0-volt reference line in figure 4-2. During the limiting portion of the 
input signal, the diode resistance should be high compared to the resistor. During the time the diode is 
conducting, the resistance of the diode should be small as compared to that of the resistor. In other words, 
the diode should have a very high front-to-back ratio (forward resistance compared to reverse resistance). 
This relationship can be better understood if you study the effects that a front-to-back resistance ratio has 
on circuit output.
