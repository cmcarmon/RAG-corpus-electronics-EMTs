The value of momentum 
 should be set experimentally between 0.5 and 0.9. There are many more modiÔ¨Å-
cations  to  the  conventional  gradient  search,  such  as  adaptive  step  sizes,  annealed  noise,  conjugate  gradients,
and second-order methods (using information contained in the Hessian matrix), but the simplicity and power
of momentum learning is hard to beat [Haykin, 1994; Bishop, 1995].
