In classical mechanics, a physical system is termed a monogenic system if the force acting on the system can be modelled in an especially convenient mathematical form (see mathematical definition below). In physics, among the most studied physical systems are monogenic systems.
In Lagrangian mechanics, the property of being monogenic is a necessary condition for the equivalence of different formulations of principle. If a physical system is both a holonomic system and a monogenic system, then it is possible to derive Lagrange's equations from d'Alembert's principle; it is also possible to derive Lagrange's equations from Hamilton's principle.
The term was introduced by Cornelius Lanczos in his book The Variational Principles of Mechanics (1970).
Monogenic systems have excellent mathematical characteristics and are well suited for mathematical analysis. Pedagogically, within the discipline of mechanics, it is considered a logical starting point for any serious physics endeavour.
