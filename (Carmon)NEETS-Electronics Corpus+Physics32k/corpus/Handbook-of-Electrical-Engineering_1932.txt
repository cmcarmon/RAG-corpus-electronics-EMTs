elements converts the signal ﬂow graph to an acyclic precedence graph. By placing latches to pipeline a data
ﬂow graph, we can alter the acyclic precedence graph. In particular, the critical path of the acyclic precedence
graph  can  be  reduced.  The  new  precedence  graph  can  be  used  to  construct  schedules  with  lower  iteration
periods (although this may often require an increase in the number of processors).
