The values used for the circuit of Fig. 4.1 were normalized; that is, they are all near unity in ohms, henrys,
and farads. These values simplify computation and, as we will see later, can easily be scaled to any desired set
of  actual  element  values.  In  addition,  this  circuit  is  low-pass  because  of  the  shunt  capacitors  and  the  series
inductor. By low-pass we mean a circuit that passes the lower frequencies and attenuates higher frequencies.
The cut-off frequency is the point at which the magnitude is 0.707 (â€“3 dB) of the dc level and is the dividing
