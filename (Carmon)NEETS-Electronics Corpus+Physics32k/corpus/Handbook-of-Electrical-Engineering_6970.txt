Most signals originating from physical phenomena are analog. Most computational engines, on the other hand,
are digital. Transforming from analog to digital is straightforward: we simply sample. Regaining the original
signal  from  these  samples  and  assessing  the  information  lost  in  the  sampling  process  are  the  fundamental
questions addressed by the sampling theorem.
