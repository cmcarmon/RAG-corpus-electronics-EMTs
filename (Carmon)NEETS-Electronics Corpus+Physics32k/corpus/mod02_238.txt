WORKING VOLTAGEâ€”The working voltage of a capacitor is the maximum voltage that can be
steadily applied to the capacitor without the capacitor breaking down (shorting). The working voltage
depends upon the type of material used as the dielectric (the dielectric constant) and the thickness of the
dielectric.
