1884  Exhibition  In  the  United  States,  nothing  promoted  the  future
of  electricity  like  the  1884  International  Electrical  Exhibition.  Just
imagine a world without electricity, a world illuminated by candles and
gaslights, a world where the most common transportation was by walk-
ing and riding on horseback or by horse-drawn carriage. Into this world
an exhibition was created that highlighted Thomas Edison and reﬂected
his  highly  developed  ability  to  promote  his  inventions  and  products.
His exhibit featured spectacular lighting displays powered by an impres-
sive 100-kW “Jumbo” generator.
