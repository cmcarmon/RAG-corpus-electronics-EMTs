A simple Venn diagram with only one variable is 
shown  in  Fig.  A8.22.  The  shaded  area  represents 
the condition when variable A is true (i.e. logic 1). 
The non-shaded area represents the condition when 
variable A is false (i.e. logic 0). Obviously, variable 
A cannot  be  both  true  and  false  at  the  same  time 
hence 
the  shaded  and  non-shaded  areas  are 
mutually exclusive. 
  Figure A8.23 shows Venn diagrams for the basic 
logic functions; AND, OR, NAND and NOR. You 
should note that these diagrams convey exactly the 
same information as the truth tables in Fig. A8.20 
but presented in a different form. 
 
Karnaugh maps 
 
A Karnaugh map consists of a square or rectangular 
array of cells into which 0’s and 1’s may be placed 
to 
true  respectively.  Two 
alternative  representations  of  a  Karnaugh  map  for 
two variables are shown in Fig. A8.24.
