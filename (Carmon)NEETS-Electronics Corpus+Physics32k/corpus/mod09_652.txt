Solid-state and electron-tube counters operate in manners similar to each other. The basic solid-state 
(diode) counter circuit is shown in view (A) of figure 4-43. Capacitor C1 is the input coupling capacitor. 
Resistor R1 is the load resistor across which the output voltage is developed. For the purpose of circuit 
discussion, assume that the input pulses (shown in view (B)) are of constant amplitude and time duration 
and that only the pulse repetition frequency changes. At time T0, the positive-going input pulse is applied 
to C1 and causes the anode of D2 to become positive. D2 conducts and current ic flows through R1 and 
D2 to charge C1. Current ic, develops an output voltage across R1, shown as eout.
