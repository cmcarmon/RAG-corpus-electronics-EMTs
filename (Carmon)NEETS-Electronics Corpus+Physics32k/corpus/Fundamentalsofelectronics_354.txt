This result follows from the integral that calculates the ck from the signal. Furthermore, this result means
that Re [ck] = Re [c−k]: The real part of the Fourier coeﬃcients for real-valued signals is even. Similarly,
Im [ck] = −Im [c−k]: The imaginary parts of the Fourier coeﬃcients have odd symmetry. Consequently, if
you are given the Fourier coeﬃcients for positive indices and zero and are told the signal is real-valued, you
can ﬁnd the negative-indexed coeﬃcients, hence the entire spectrum. This kind of symmetry, ck = c∗
−k, is
known as conjugate symmetry.
