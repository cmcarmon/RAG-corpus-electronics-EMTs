Besides their use in communication to overcome the dissipative effects of
the communication medium (for example, in loud speakers or in wireless net-
working systems), amplifiers are useful for signal transmission in the presence of
noise. Figures 7.3 and 7.4 show two signal transmission scenarios. In Figure 7.3,
the signal transmitted in its native form is overwhelmed by noise at the receiver.
In Figure 7.4, however, the amplified signal is seen to be much more tolerant to
noise. (Contrast this with the application of amplification for noise immunity
in digital systems as discussed in Section 6.9.2.)
