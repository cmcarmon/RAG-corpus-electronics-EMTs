The eutectic reaction is defined as follows:





Liquid



→


cooling



eutectic temperature



α



solid solution

+
β



solid solution



{\displaystyle {\text{Liquid}}{\xrightarrow[{\text{cooling}}]{\text{eutectic temperature}}}\alpha \,\,{\text{solid solution}}+\beta \,\,{\text{solid solution}}}

This type of reaction is an invariant reaction, because it is in thermal equilibrium; another way to define this is the Gibbs free energy equals zero. Tangibly, this means the liquid and two solid solutions all coexist at the same time and are in chemical equilibrium. There is also a thermal arrest for the duration of the change of phase during which the temperature of the system does not change.
The resulting solid macrostructure from a eutectic reaction depends on a few factors. The most important factor is how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow. The most common structure is a lamellar structure, but other possible structures include rodlike, globular, and acicular.
