Examples of nonelectronic measuring devices are the vibrating-reed meter and the moving-disk 
frequency meter. (Both of these devices were discussed in NEETS, module 3.) They are used primarily to 
measure the frequency of ac power, 60 Hz. However, such instruments do not have a wide frequency 
range. The most common instruments available for the measurement of audio frequencies are 
oscilloscopes and frequency counters.
