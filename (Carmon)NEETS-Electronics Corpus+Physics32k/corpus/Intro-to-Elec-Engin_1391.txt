the free-space wavelength is given by c/f. Table 15.1.1 shows some free-space wavelengths at
selected frequencies. If the traveling-wave technique is to be employed for distances greater than
1/10 wavelength, a distance of 3 mm at 10 GHz would require the use of this technique, whereas
the same distance at 100 MHz would not. On the other hand, a distance of 1 km is insigniÔ¨Åcant
at power-line frequencies, but not in the broadcast band.
