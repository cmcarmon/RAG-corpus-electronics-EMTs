Using the orthogonality relation (5.28), the integral equals δ (m − n), where δ (n) is the unit sample (Fig-
ure 5.8). Thus, the double sum collapses into a single sum because nonzero values occur only when n = m,
n s2 (n) the energy in the discrete-time signal s (n) in spite
of the fact that discrete-time signals don’t consume (or produce for that matter) energy. This terminology
is a carry-over from the analog world.
