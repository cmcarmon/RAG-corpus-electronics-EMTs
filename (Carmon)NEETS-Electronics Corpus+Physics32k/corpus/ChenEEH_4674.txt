The importance of idle speed control is due in part to vehicles
(in a typical drive cycle) spending a large percentage of fuel in
the idle condition. A satisfactory idle speed control algorithm
should regulate the engine operating at a low speed while
effectively rejecting typical torque disturbances due to accessory
loads, such as the power steering pump, the air conditioning
compressor, the various electrical loads, the engagement of the
automatic transmission, and so on. A production idle speed
controller generally consists of an anticipatory term using the
information from the accessories, a proportional-integral feed-
back control term operating on the air mass signal, and a
proportional feedback term for the spark timing. A survey of
idle speed models and control methodologies is given by Hrovat
et al. (1996).
