n o n l i n e a r r e s i s t o r To illustrate the use of incremental analysis, we
examine the nonlinear device circuit shown in Figure 4.44a, a crude form of voltage
regulator based on the hypothetical nonlinear resistor discussed earlier. Assume R = 1k
and that the nonlinear device is characterized by the following v i relationship:
