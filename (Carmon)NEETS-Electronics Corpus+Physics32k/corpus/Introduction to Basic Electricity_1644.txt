band) represents the first digit (1). The green band 
(second band) represents the second digit (5). The 
red band (third band) represents the number of zeros  
(2 zeros—00) to be added to the first two digits. The 
silver band (fourth band) indicates a resistance toler‑
ance of 10%. Therefore, this is a 1500‑ohm resistor 
with a 610% tolerance.
