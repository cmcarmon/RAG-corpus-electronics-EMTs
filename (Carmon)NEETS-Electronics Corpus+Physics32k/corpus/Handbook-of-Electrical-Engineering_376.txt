By Kirchhoff ’s current law applied at node N in Fig. 3.28(b), we ﬁnd that the current in the return line is
the sum of the three currents in Eq. (3.16). However, since this sum was found to be zero, the return line carries
no current. Hence it can be removed entirely without affecting the operation of the system. The resulting circuit
is redrawn in Fig. 3.30. Because of its geometrical form, this connection of both the sources and the loads is
said to be a wye (Y) connection.
