becomes forward biased and the NPN transistor 
 conducts. This causes base current to flow through the 
PNP transistor, which in turn allows the PNP transis-
tor to conduct. The collector current flowing through 
the PNP transistor causes the base current to flow 
through the NPN transistor. The two transistors hold 
each other in the conducting state, allowing current 
to flow continuously from the cathode to the anode. 
This action takes place even though the gate voltage 
is  applied only momentarily. The momentary gate 
 voltage causes the circuit to switch to the  conducting 
state and the circuit to continue conducting even 
though the gate voltage is removed. The anode current 
is limited only by the external circuit. To switch the 
SCR off, it is necessary to reduce the anode-to-cathode 
 voltage below the hold-on value, typically close to 0. 
This causes both transistors to turn off and remain off 
until a gate voltage is again applied.
