Voltmeters with electromechanical movements are typically given ratings in ”ohms per volt”
of range to designate the amount of circuit impact created by the current draw of the move-
ment. Because such meters rely on different values of multiplier resistors to give different mea-
surement ranges, their lead-to-lead resistances will change depending on what range they’re
set to. Digital voltmeters, on the other hand, often exhibit a constant resistance across their
test leads regardless of range setting (but not always!), and as such are usually rated simply
in ohms of input resistance, rather than ”ohms per volt” sensitivity.
