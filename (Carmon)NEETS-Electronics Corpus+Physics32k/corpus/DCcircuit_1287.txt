Physical Size: For most applications in electronics, minimum size is the goal for component
engineering. The smaller components can be made, the more circuitry can be built into a
smaller package, and usually weight is saved as well. With capacitors, there are two major
limiting factors to the minimum size of a unit: working voltage and capacitance. And these
two factors tend to be in opposition to each other. For any given choice in dielectric materials,
the only way to increase the voltage rating of a capacitor is to increase the thickness of the
dielectric. However, as we have seen, this has the effect of decreasing capacitance. Capacitance
can be brought back up by increasing plate area. but this makes for a larger unit. This is why
you cannot judge a capacitorâ€™s rating in Farads simply by size. A capacitor of any given size may
be relatively high in capacitance and low in working voltage, vice versa, or some compromise
between the two extremes. Take the following two photographs for example:
