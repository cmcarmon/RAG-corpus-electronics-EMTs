The electric field,






E
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}
, in units of newtons per coulomb or volts per meter, is a vector field that can be defined everywhere, except at the location of point charges (where it diverges to infinity). It is defined as the electrostatic force






F

{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}\,}
in newtons on a hypothetical small test charge at the point due to Coulomb's Law, divided by the magnitude of the charge

{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}={{\vec {F}} \over q}\,}

Electric field lines are useful for visualizing the electric field. Field lines begin on positive charge and terminate on negative charge. They are parallel to the direction of the electric field at each point, and the density of these field lines is a measure of the magnitude of the electric field at any given point.

The electric field produced by a distribution of charges is given by the volume charge density
