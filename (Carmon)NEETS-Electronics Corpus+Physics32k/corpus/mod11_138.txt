Any portion of the twt output signal that reflects back to the input will cause oscillations within the 
tube which results in a decrease in amplification. Attenuators are placed along the length of the helix to 
prevent reflections from reaching the input. The attenuator causes a loss in amplitude, as can be seen in 
figure 2-15, view (B), but it can be placed so as to minimize losses while still isolating the input from the 
output.
