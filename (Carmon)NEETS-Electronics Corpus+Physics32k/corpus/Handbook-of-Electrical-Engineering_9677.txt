One-way functions: Functions that are easy to evaluate but difﬁcult (on average) to invert.
Private-key encryption scheme: A scheme to generate keys so that encryption and decryption of messages
can  be  executed  efﬁciently  when  knowing  the  key,  but  it  is  infeasible  to  gain  any  information  of  the
message given only the encrypted message (but not the key).
