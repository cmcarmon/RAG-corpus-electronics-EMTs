The trend in deploying higher-power satellites has an inverse effect on the size of the earth station antenna.
The earth stations are becoming smaller, less complex, and more cost effective. Private hubs are now typically
in the range of 3.5 to 7.6 m and are not required to be staffed. Two-way VSATs antennas originally deployed
in sizes from 1.2 to 1.8 m are now using elliptical or rectangular-shaped antennas with apertures equivalent to
1.0 m or less. Two-way ultra-small aperture terminals are also emerging. These lower-cost, lower-functionality
earth stations are designed for thin route, niche-type applications such as point-of-sale and credit card trans-
action processing. The advances in DSP technology will continue to enhance the capabilities and performance
while at the same time lowering the cost of VSATs. The advances in MMIC technology continue to miniaturize
the RF components while increasing reliability.
