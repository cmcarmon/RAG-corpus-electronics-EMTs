Volumetric flow rate can also be defined by:




Q
=

v

⋅

A



{\displaystyle Q=\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {A} }

where:
v = flow velocity
A = cross-sectional vector area/surface
The above equation is only true for flat, plane cross-sections. In general, including curved surfaces, the equation becomes a surface integral:




Q
=

∬

A



v

⋅

d


A



{\displaystyle Q=\iint _{A}\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} }

This is the definition used in practice. The area required to calculate the volumetric flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the volume passes through, A, and a unit vector normal to the area, n̂. The relation is A = An̂.
The reason for the dot product is as follows. The only volume flowing through the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, that is, parallel to the unit normal. This amount is:




Q
=
v
A
cos
⁡
θ


{\displaystyle Q=vA\cos \theta }

where θ is the angle between the unit normal n̂ and the velocity vector v of the substance elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor cos θ. As θ increases less volume passes through. Substance which passes tangential to the area, that is perpendicular to the unit normal, does not pass through the area. This occurs when θ = π/2 and so this amount of the volumetric flow rate is zero:




Q
=
v
A
cos
⁡

(

)

=
0


{\displaystyle Q=vA\cos \left({\frac {\pi }{2}}\right)=0}

These results are equivalent to the dot product between velocity and the normal direction to the area.
When the mass flow rate is known, and the density can be assumed constant, this is an easy way to get
