The effect of inductive reactance is to cause the current to lag the voltage, while that of capacitive 
reactance is to cause the current to lead the voltage. Therefore, since inductive reactance and capacitive 
reactance are exactly opposite in their effects, what will be the result when the two are combined? It is not 
hard to see that the net effect is a tendency to cancel each other, with the combined effect then equal to 
the difference between their values. This resultant is called REACTANCE; it is represented by the symbol 
X; and expressed by the equation X = XL − XC or X = XC − X L. Thus, if a circuit contains 50 ohms of 
inductive reactance and 25 ohms of capacitive reactance in series, the net reactance, or X, is 50 ohms − 25 
ohms, or 25 ohms of inductive reactance.
