Ammeters of this design are made, and are called ”clamp-on” meters because they have
”jaws” which can be opened and then secured around a circuit wire. Clamp-on ammeters make
for quick and safe current measurements, especially on high-power industrial circuits. Because
the circuit under test has had no additional resistance inserted into it by a clamp-on meter,
there is no error induced in taking a current measurement.
