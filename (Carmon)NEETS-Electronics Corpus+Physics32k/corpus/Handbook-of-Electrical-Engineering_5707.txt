are inversely proportional to the harmonic order, as shown by the spectrum of Fig. 62.6(b) which correspond
to  the  time  waveform  of  Fig. 62.6(a).  These  are,  of  course,  maximum  levels  for  ideal  system  conditions,  i.e.,
with an inﬁnite (zero impedance) ac system and a perfectly ﬂat direct current (i.e., inﬁnite smoothing reactance).
