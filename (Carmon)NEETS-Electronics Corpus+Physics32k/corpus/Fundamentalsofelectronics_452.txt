rejecting high or low frequencies, the vocal tract serves to shape the spectrum of the vocal cords. In the
time domain, we have a periodic signal, the pitch, serving as the input to a linear system. We know that
the output—the speech signal we utter and that is heard by others and ourselves—will also be periodic.
Example time-domain speech signals are shown in Figure 4.15, where the periodicity is quite apparent.
Exercise 4.18
(Solution on p. 140.)
From the waveform plots shown in Figure 4.15, determine the pitch period and the pitch frequency.
