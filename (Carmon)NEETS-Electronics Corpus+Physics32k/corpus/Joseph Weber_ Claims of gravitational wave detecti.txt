In the 1970s, the results of these gravitational wave experiments were largely discredited, although Weber continued to argue that he had detected gravitational waves. In order to test Weber's results, IBM Physicist Richard Garwin built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's. In six months, it detected only one pulse, which was most likely noise. David Douglass, another physicist, had discovered an error in Weber's computer program that, he claimed, produced the daily gravitational wave signals that Weber claimed to have detected. Because of the error, a signal seemed to appear out of noise. Garwin aggressively confronted Weber with this information at the Fifth Cambridge Conference on Relativity at MIT in June 1974. A series of letters was then exchanged in Physics Today. Garwin asserted that Weber's model was "insane, because the universe would convert all of its energy into gravitational radiation in 50 million years or so, if one were really detecting what Joe Weber was detecting." "Weber," Garwin declared, "is just such a character that he has not said, 'No, I never did see a gravity wave.' And the National Science Foundation, unfortunately, which funded that work, is not man enough to clean the record, which they should." In 1972, Heinz Billing and colleagues at Max Planck Institute for Physics built a detector that was similar to Joseph Weber's to verify his claim but found no results.
The process of how physicists and the general public came to reject Weber's claims that he had found gravitational waves is described in several books and articles, including Gravitational Wave Blues, excerpted from Black Hole Blues and Other Songs from Outer Space, by Janna Levin; several articles and the books Gravity's Shadow and Gravityâ€™s Ghost: Scientific Discovery in the 21st Century by sociologist Harry Collins; and Einstein's Unfinished Symphony by Marcia Bartusiak.
Weber himself continued to maintain his gravitational wave detection equipment until his death.
