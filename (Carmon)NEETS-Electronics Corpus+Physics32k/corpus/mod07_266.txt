If you consider the sensitive nature and the various interacting properties of semiconductors, it should 
not be surprising to you that solid state devices can be designed for many different purposes. In fact, devices 
with special features are so numerous and new designs are so frequently introduced that it would be beyond 
the scope of this chapter to describe all of the devices in use today. Therefore, this chapter will include a 
variety of representative devices that are used extensively in Navy equipment to give you an idea of the 
diversity and versatility that have been made possible. These devices have been grouped into three 
categories: diodes, optoelectronic devices, and transistors. In this chapter each device will be described and 
the basic operation of each one will be discussed.
