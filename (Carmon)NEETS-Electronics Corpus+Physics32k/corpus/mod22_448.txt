DISKETTEâ€”A mass storage device in which information is stored on one or both sides of a flexible
disk that can be magnetized. The diskette is rotated by a diskette drive and information is stored and
retrieved by one or more magnetically sensitive read/write heads. Diskettes are also called floppy
disks because the disk bends easily.
