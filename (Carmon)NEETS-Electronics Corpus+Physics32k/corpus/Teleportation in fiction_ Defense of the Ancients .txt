Heroes in DotA can be teleported from one location on the map to another location. Items such as Scroll of Town Portal or Boots of Travel can be used to teleport the heroes themselves. Some heroes have inherent skills that can teleport themselves or other heroes to different locations on the map (e.g. Pit Lord or Nature's Prophet). The action of teleportation takes a few seconds of "channeling" time for the process to be complete and the hero must remain stationary during the process.
