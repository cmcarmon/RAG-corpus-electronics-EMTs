In Step 5 we ﬁt with NSUB to get the variation of threshold voltage with back-bias. We will get better results
if we restrict ourselves to lower values of Vg s  (but still above subthreshold) because no mobility degradation
adjustment exists with back-bias, and therefore the ﬁt may not be very good at higher Vg s  values for the nonzero
back-bias curves.
