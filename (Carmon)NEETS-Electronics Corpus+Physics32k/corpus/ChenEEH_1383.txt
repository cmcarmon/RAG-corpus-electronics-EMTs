fundamental beneﬁt of reconﬁgurable technology over appli-
cation-speciﬁc integrated circuits; it has the potential to re-
shape the electronics
industry when combined with a
‘‘chipless’’ business model for providing intellectual properties
for reconﬁgurable devices (Kean, 2000). Design upgradability
is particularly important for applications where standards
evolve quickly or where there is a need to customize designs
to unpredictable run-time conditions.
