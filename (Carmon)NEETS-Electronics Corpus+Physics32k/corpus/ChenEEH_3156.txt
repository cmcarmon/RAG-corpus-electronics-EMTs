Electrical stresses include those imposed by power frequency
nominal operating voltage, which is a steady-state stress. Volt-
age surges generated by lightning or switching operations
impose a higher albeit momentary stress on the insulator. In
the event of an insulator ï¬‚ashover, the insulator is subjected to
a large fault current (several kiloamperes) at power frequency
in the form of an arc, called power arc, until the protection
isolates the fault.
