The simpliÔ¨Åed schematic of the MOS capacitor is shown in
Figure 3.1. The structure is similar to a parallel plate capacitor
in which the bottom electrode is replaced by a semiconductor.
When Si is used as the substrate material, the top electrode,
known as the gate, is typically made of polycrystalline silicon
(polysilicon), and the dielectric is thermally grown silicon
dioxide. In MOS terminology, the substrate is commonly re-
ferred to as the body.
