And with that, our table of qualitative values stands completed. This particular exercise
may look laborious due to all the detailed commentary, but the actual process can be performed
very quickly with some practice. An important thing to realize here is that the general proce-
dure is little different from quantitative analysis: start with the known values, then proceed
to determining total resistance, then total current, then transfer Ô¨Ågures of voltage and current
as allowed by the rules of series and parallel circuits to the appropriate columns.
