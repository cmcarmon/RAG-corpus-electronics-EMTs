made from semiconductor material. They typically exhibit a high resis-
tance (about 1 MΩ) in darkness and a fairly low resistance (about 100 Ω) 
in bright light, but you can use a multimeter (as I describe in Chapter 16) 
to determine the actual resistances exhibited by a specific photoresistor. 
The typical photoresistor is most sensitive to visible light, especially in 
the green‐yellow spectrum. A photoresistor can be installed with current 
running either way in your circuits.
