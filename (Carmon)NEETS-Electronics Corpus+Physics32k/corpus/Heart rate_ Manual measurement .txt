Heart rate is measured by finding the pulse of the heart. This pulse rate can be found at any point on the body where the artery's pulsation is transmitted to the surface by pressuring it with the index and middle fingers; often it is compressed against an underlying structure like bone. (A good area is on the neck, under the corner of the jaw.) The thumb should not be used for measuring another person's heart rate, as its strong pulse may interfere with the correct perception of the target pulse.
The radial artery is the easiest to use to check the heart rate. However, in emergency situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is not strong enough to be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.
Possible points for measuring the heart rate are:
The ventral aspect of the wrist on the side of the thumb (radial artery).
The ulnar artery.
The neck (carotid artery).
The inside of the elbow, or under the biceps muscle (brachial artery).
The groin (femoral artery).
Behind the medial malleolus on the feet (posterior tibial artery).
Middle of dorsum of the foot (dorsalis pedis).
Behind the knee (popliteal artery).
Over the abdomen (abdominal aorta).
The chest (apex of the heart), which can be felt with one's hand or fingers. It is also possible to auscultate the heart using a stethoscope.
The temple (superficial temporal artery).
The lateral edge of the mandible (facial artery).
The side of the head near the ear (posterior auricular artery).
