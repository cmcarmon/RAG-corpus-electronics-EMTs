SSB TELETYPEWRITER CIRCUITS.â€”With few exceptions, you will find ssb used on all long-
haul (great distance) teletypewriter circuits, which includes ship-to-shore. Most of these systems are
covered circuits; that is, an electronic cryptographic device on both ends of the circuit automatically
encrypts and decrypts message traffic. These devices are used on point-to-point, ship-to-shore, ship-to-
ship, and broadcast circuits.
