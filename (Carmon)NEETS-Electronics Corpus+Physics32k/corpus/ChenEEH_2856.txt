The RCS of a target depends on the aspect angle, frequency,
and polarization. It is not directly related to the physical area.
When the object dimension is much greater than the wave-
length, the RCS of a conducting plate with a physical area A
observed at the normal direction can be approximated by the
product of the effective gain of the plate and the physical area.
The product is given by:
