Solution to Exercise 3.6 (p. 40)
Replacing the current source by a voltage source does not change the fact that the voltages are identical.
Consequently, vin = R2iout or iout =
. This result does not depend on the resistor R1, which means that
we simply have a resistor (R2) across a voltage source. The two-resistor circuit has no apparent use.
