Component Object Model (COM) was developed by Microsoft
and is used to integrate different software applications on
platforms running Microsoft Windows. Distributed Compo-
nent Object Model (DCOM) extends this standard to software
applications that may be running on different Windows-based
platforms and are connected via a network. Applicability to
other platforms is under development.
