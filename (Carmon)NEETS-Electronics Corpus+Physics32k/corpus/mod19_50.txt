SYMPTOMS OF ELECTRIC SHOCK.Â—When you find someone who has received a severe 
electric shock, the person's skin is usually very white or pale blue. In the case of victims with dark skin, it 
may be necessary to rely primarily on the color of the mucous membranes on the inside of the mouth or 
under the eye lid or under the nail bed. A person in or going into electric shock has a bluish color to these 
membranes instead of a healthy pink. The victim's pulse is very weak or absent. The person is 
unconscious, and usually the skin is burned. A stiffness of the body may happen in a few minutes. This is 
caused by the muscles reacting to shock. You should not consider this condition as rigor mortis. You 
should make sure the victim is no longer touching the live circuit and then start artificial respiration. 
People have recovered after body stiffness has set in.
