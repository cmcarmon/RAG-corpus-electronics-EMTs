A circuit may look complicated at ﬁrst.
But once the sources are turned off in
an attempt to ﬁnd the form of the tran-
sient response, it may be reducible to
a ﬁrst-order circuit, when the storage
elements can be combined, or to a
parallel/series RLC circuit. If it is re-
ducible to a ﬁrst-order circuit, the solu-
tion becomes simply what we had in
Chapter 7. If it is reducible to a parallel
or series RLC circuit, we apply the tech-
niques of previous sections in this
chapter.
