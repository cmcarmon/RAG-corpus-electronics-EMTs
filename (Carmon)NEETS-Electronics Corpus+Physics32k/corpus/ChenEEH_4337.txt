may have a different number of solutions, and how many
solutions exist is related to the rank of A. To solve simulta-
neous equations, MATLAB provides the backslash command (\)
to determine a vector x 2 F n, satisfying Ax ¼ y for A 2 F mn
and y 2 F m. Given A 2 F mn and Y 2 F mp, the backslash
operator can be used to solve for X 2 F np in AX ¼ Y . Di-
rectly solving for the matrix inverse, assuming one exists, can
be avoided by solving for X in AX ¼ I. This is usually faster
and more accurate because Cholesky or LU factorizations are
employed. More advanced factorizations contribute to solving
the sparse system problem (A is large and has few nonzero
elements) that occurs,
in electrical power
systems.
All is not lost in terms of inverses in the case of nonsquare
matrices A 2 F mn or rank-deﬁcient square matrices. Deﬁne
the pseudoinverse Aþ 2 F nm by:
