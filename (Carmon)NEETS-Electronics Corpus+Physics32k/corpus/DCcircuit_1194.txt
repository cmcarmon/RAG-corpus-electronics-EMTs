As it was said before, fuses are not the only type of overcurrent protection device in use.
Switch-like devices called circuit breakers are often (and more commonly) used to open circuits
with excessive current, their popularity due to the fact that they don’t destroy themselves in
the process of breaking the circuit as fuses do. In any case, though, placement of the overcur-
rent protection device in a circuit will follow the same general guidelines listed above: namely,
to ”fuse” the side of the power supply not connected to ground.
