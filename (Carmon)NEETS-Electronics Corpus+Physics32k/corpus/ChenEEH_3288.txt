In these equations, the voltage V is normalized to some
rated voltage. The exponents a and b can be 0, 1, or 2 where
they could represent constant power, current, or impedance
loads, respectively. Alternatively, they can represent composite
loads with a generally ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 and b
ranging between 1.5 and 6.0.
