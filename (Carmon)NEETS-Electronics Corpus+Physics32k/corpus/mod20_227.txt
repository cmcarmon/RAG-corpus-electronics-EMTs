FORWARD BIASÂ—An external voltage that is applied to a PN junction in the conducting direction so that 
the junction offers only minimum resistance to the flow of current. Conduction is accomplished by 
majority current carriers (holes in P-type material; electrons in N-type material) [7] [13] [14].
