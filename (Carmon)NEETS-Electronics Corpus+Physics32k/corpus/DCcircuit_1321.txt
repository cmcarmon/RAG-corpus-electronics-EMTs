The nonlinearity of material permeability may be graphed for better understanding. We’ll
place the quantity of ﬁeld intensity (H), equal to ﬁeld force (mmf) divided by the length of the
material, on the horizontal axis of the graph. On the vertical axis, we’ll place the quantity of
ﬂux density (B), equal to total ﬂux divided by the cross-sectional area of the material. We will
use the quantities of ﬁeld intensity (H) and ﬂux density (B) instead of ﬁeld force (mmf) and
total ﬂux (Φ) so that the shape of our graph remains independent of the physical dimensions of
our test material. What we’re trying to do here is show a mathematical relationship between
ﬁeld force and ﬂux for any chunk of a particular substance, in the same spirit as describing a
material’s speciﬁc resistance in ohm-cmil/ft instead of its actual resistance in ohms.
