Thermistors 
 
With  conventional  resistors  we  would  normally 
require  resistance  to  remain  the  same  over  a  wide 
range  of  temperatures  (i.e.  " should  be  zero).  On 
the other hand, there are applications in which we 
could use the effect of varying resistance to detect a 
temperature  change.  Components  that  allow  us  to 
do this are known as thermistors. The resistance of 
a thermistor  changes  markedly  with  temperature 
and 
in 
temperature sensing and temperature compensating 
applications.  Two  basic  types  of  thermistor  are 
available, NTC and PTC (see Fig. 2.16).
