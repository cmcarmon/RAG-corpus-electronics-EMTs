Itâ€™s precisely because of this unique bonding and sharing of electrons that the 
semiconductor crystal acts like an insulator most of the time. Each atom thinks 
it has more valence electrons than it really has, and those electrons stay close 
to home. (This behavior is very different from a typical conductor atom, which 
often has just one valence electron that thinks it is free to roam around.)
