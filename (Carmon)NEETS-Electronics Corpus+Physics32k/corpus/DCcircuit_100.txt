In keeping with the ”open” and ”closed” terminology of circuits, a switch that is making
contact from one connection terminal to the other (example: a knife switch with the blade fully
touching the stationary contact point) provides continuity for electrons to ﬂow through, and
is called a closed switch. Conversely, a switch that is breaking continuity (example: a knife
switch with the blade not touching the stationary contact point) won’t allow electrons to pass
through and is called an open switch. This terminology is often confusing to the new student
of electronics, because the words ”open” and ”closed” are commonly understood in the context
of a door, where ”open” is equated with free passage and ”closed” with blockage. With electrical
switches, these terms have opposite meaning: ”open” means no ﬂow while ”closed” means free
passage of electrons.
