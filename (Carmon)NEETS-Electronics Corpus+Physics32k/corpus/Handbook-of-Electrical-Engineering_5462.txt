Back-to-Back DC System
In a back-to-back dc system (Fig. 61.6), both rectiﬁer and inverter are located in the same station, usually in
the same building. The rectiﬁer and inverter are usually tied with a reactor, which is generally of outdoor, air-
core  design. A  back-to-back  dc  system  is  used  to  tie  two  asynchronous ac systems (systems  that  are  not  in
synchronism). The two ac systems can be of different operating frequencies, for example, one 50 Hz and the
other 60 Hz. Examples are the Sakuma and Shin-Shinano converter stations in Japan. Both are used to link the
50- and 60-Hz ac systems. The Acaray station in Paraguay links the Paraguay system (50 Hz) with the Brazilian
system, which is 60 Hz. Back-to-back dc links are also used to interconnect two ac systems that are of the same
frequency  but  are  not  operating  in  synchronism.  In  North  America,  eastern  and  western  systems  are  not
synchronized, and Quebec and Texas are not synchronized with their neighboring systems. A dc link offers a
practical solution as a tie between nonsynchronous systems. Thus to date, there are 10 back-to-back dc links
in operation interconnecting such systems in North America. Similarly, in Europe, eastern and western systems
are not synchronized, and dc offers the practical choice for interconnection between them.
