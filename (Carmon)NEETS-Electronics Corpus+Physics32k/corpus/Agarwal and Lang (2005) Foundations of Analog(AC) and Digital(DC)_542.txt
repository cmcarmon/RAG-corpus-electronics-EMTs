Norton and Thévenin equivalents are particularly useful because often the two
parameters are easy to find, as a consequence of the strong circuit constraints
imposed as shown in Figures 3.55 and 3.75. This is best illustrated by an
example. Suppose we are given the network in Figure 3.89a, and are asked to
find the voltage across R3 for a number of different values of R3. We could just
solve the whole network for each value of R3, but a simpler approach is to find
the Thévenin equivalent of the network driving R3, that is, the network to the
left of the points x x. For clarity in this first example, we abstract this portion
of the network in Figure 3.89b.
