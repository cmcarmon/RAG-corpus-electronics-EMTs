Real-Time Applications
A  number  of  applications  are  discussed  in  Chassaing  and  Horning  (1990)  using  TMS320C25  code  and  in
Chassaing (1992) using TMS320C30 and C code. These applications include multirate and adaptive ﬁltering,
modulation techniques, and graphic and parametric equalizers. Two applications are brieﬂy discussed here: a
ten-band multirate ﬁlter and a video line rate analysis.
