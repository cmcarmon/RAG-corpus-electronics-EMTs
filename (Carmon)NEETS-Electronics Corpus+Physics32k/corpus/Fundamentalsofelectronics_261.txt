This expression represents the general input-output relation for this circuit, known as the standard feed-
back conÔ¨Åguration. Once we learn more about op-amps, in particular what its typical element values
are, the expression will simplify greatly. Do note that the units check, and that the parameter G of the
dependent source is a dimensionless gain.
