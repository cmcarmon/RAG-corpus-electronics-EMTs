A ligand described in ionic terms can bond to a metal through however many lone pairs it has available. For example, many alkoxides use one of their three lone pairs to make a single bond to a metal center. In this situation the oxygen is sp3 hybridized according to valence bond theory. Increasing the bond order to two by involving another lone pair changes the hybridization at the oxygen to an sp2 center with an expected expansion in the M-O-R bond angle and contraction in the M-O bond length. If all three lone pairs are included for a bond order of three than the M-O bond distance contracts further and since the oxygen is a sp center the M-O-R bond angle is 180Ëš or linear. Similarly with the imidos are commonly referred to as either bent (sp2) or linear (sp). Even the oxo can be sp2 or sp hybridized. The triply bonded oxo, similar to carbon monoxide, is partially positive at the oxygen atom and unreactive towards bronsted acids at the oxygen atom. When such a complex is reduced, the triple bond can be converted to a double bond at which point the oxygen no longer bears a partial positive charge and is reactive towards acid.
