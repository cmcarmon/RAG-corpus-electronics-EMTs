It is also possible to feed a microstrip antenna element using noncontacting feeds of various forms. Fig. 38.19b
shows  a  proximity  feed,  where  a  two-layer  substrate  houses  an  embedded  microstrip  transmission  feed  line,
with the radiating patch located on the top of a substrate layer placed over the microstrip feed line. The feed
line  is  terminated  in  an  open-circuited  stub  below  the  patch.  Proximity  coupling  (often  referred  to  in  the
literature by the less-descriptive term electromagnetic coupling) has the advantage of allowing the patch to reside
on a relatively thick substrate, for enhanced bandwidth, while the feed line sees an effectively thinner substrate,
