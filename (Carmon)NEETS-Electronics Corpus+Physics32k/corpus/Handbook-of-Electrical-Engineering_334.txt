Tellegen’s Theorem
A result that has far-reaching consequences in electrical engineering is Tellegen’s theorem. It will be stated in
terms of the networks shown in Fig. 3.20. These two are said to be topologically equivalent; that is, they are
represented by the same graph but the components that constitute the branches of the graph are not necessarily
the same in the two networks. they can even be nonlinear, as illustrated by the diode in one of the networks.
Assuming all branches have standard references, including the source branches, Tellegen’s theorem states that
