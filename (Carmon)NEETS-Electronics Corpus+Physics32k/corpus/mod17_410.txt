When the transmitter and receiver switches are synchronized, the signals will be fed in the proper 
sequence to the receiver channels. The samples from transmitter channel one will be fed to receiver 
channel one. In this way, many channels of audio are combined to form a single output (multiplexed) 
chain. Time spacing occurs between the components of the separate channels. The chain is transmitted 
(via wire or radio path) to distant demultiplexing receivers. Each receiving channel functions to select and 
reconstruct only the information included in the originally transmitted channel.
