Figure 112.12 shows a typical control ﬂow diagram or ﬂowchart. The connections in this case represent the
order of execution. The triangular blocks are decision blocks while the square blocks are variable assignment
blocks  written  in  a  PASCAL-like  language.  Also  shown  are  a  multiway  branch  and  a  truth  table.  BEACON
requires that the control ﬂow diagrams produce structured code which equivalently means that a diagram can
be implemented as a sequence of if-then-else statements without go-to’s.
