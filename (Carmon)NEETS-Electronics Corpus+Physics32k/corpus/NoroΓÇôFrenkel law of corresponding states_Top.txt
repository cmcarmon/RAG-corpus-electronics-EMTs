The Noroâ€“Frenkel law of corresponding states is an equation in thermodynamics that describes the critical temperature of the liquid-gas transition T as a function of the range of the attractive potential R. It states that, all short-ranged spherically symmetric pair-wise additive attractive potentials are characterised by the same thermodynamics properties if compared at the same reduced density and second virial coefficient
