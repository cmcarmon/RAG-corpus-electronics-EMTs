Scanning of the circuit shows that it has three nodal voltages
and that it needs three branch currents for MNA formulation.
The branch currents are required, one each, for the voltage
source, the inductor in impedance form, and the VVT. The
total number of variables is six and can be computed before
the matrices are formulated. The MNA equations are as follows:
