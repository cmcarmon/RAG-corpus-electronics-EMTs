Substrate or body: The portion of the MOSFET that lies between the source and drain and under the gate.
The gate is separated from the body by a thin gate insulator, usually silicon dioxide. The gate modulates
the conductivity of the body, providing a gate-controlled resistance between the source and drain. The
body  is  sometimes  dc-biased  to  adjust  overall  circuit  operation.  In  some  circuits  the  body  voltage  can
swing up and down as a result of input signals, leading to “body-effect” or “back-gate bias” effects that
must be controlled for reliable circuit response.
