At T0, the negative alternation of the input gate is applied to the base of Q1, driving it into cutoff. At 
this time the transistor is effectively removed from the circuit. The circuit is now a series-RC network 
with 50 volts applied. At the instant Q1 cuts off, 50 volts will appear across the combination of R2 and 
R3 (the capacitor being a short at the first instant). The 50 volts will divide proportionally, according to 
the size of the two resistors. R2 then will have 49.5 volts and R3 will have 0.5 volt. The 0.5 volt across 
R3 (jump resistor) is the amplitude of the jump voltage. Since the output is taken across R3 and C2 in 
series, the output "jumps" to 0.5 volt.
