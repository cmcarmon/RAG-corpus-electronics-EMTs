One way to effectively increase noise immunity is to increase
the switching threshold voltage Vth of the gate. Vth is deÔ¨Åned
as the input voltage at which the output changes state. Increas-
ing the Vth, on the other hand, has an adverse effect on the
performance, such as on speed and power consumption, which
are the prime features of dynamic circuits.
