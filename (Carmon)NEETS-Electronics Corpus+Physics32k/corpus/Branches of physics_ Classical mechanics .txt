Classical mechanics is a model of the physics of forces acting upon bodies; includes sub-fields to describe the behaviours of solids, gases, and fluids. It is often referred to as "Newtonian mechanics" after Isaac Newton and his laws of motion. It also includes classical approach as given by Hamiltonian and Lagrange methods. It deals with motion of particles and general system of particles.
There are many branches of classical mechanics, such as: statics, dynamics, kinematics, continuum mechanics (which includes fluid mechanics), statistical mechanics, etc.
Mechanics: branch of physics in which we study about the object and properties of an object in form of motion under the action of force.
