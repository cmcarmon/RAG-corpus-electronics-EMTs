This example represents a preliminary test of the control
system to demonstrate that the actuator can be commanded
to move the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the structure to a speciﬁc location.
Under the hypothesis that the VFS control designs work
to make small errors smaller, a command request r ¼ xx1 ¼
0:004 m was speciﬁed, and a constant offset of y0 ¼ 0:001 m,
representing a biased position sensor, was added to the meas-
ured output of the plant. Regulation about a nonzero set point
