Among	the	several	reasons	to	use	standard	units	of	measurement	are	for
indications	of	exact	measurements	and	for	indications	of	the	preferred
measurements	in	a	system.	These	units	bring	uniformity.
In	circuits,	the	usual	standard	units	that	you	encounter	are	V,	W,	I,	and	P.	Although
there	are	more,	those	who	wish	to	explain	a	system’s	electric	flow	rely	on	these
measurements;	rather	than	introduce	a	bunch,	which	may	only	make	matters	more
confusing,	some	are	preferred.	Moreover,	without	such	units,	understanding	others’
discussions	of	circuits	is	nearly	impossible.
