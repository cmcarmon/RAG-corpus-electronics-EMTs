▶• Nickel‐cadmium (NiCd) batteries, like NiMH batteries, generate 
about 1.2 volts. NiCds (pronounced “NYE cads”) have declined 
drastically in popularity since their heyday in the mid‐1990’s, due 
to their poor capacity, their toxic content (cadmium), improve-
ments in other battery technologies (particularly NiMH), and a 
flaw NiCds exhibit known as the memory effect, which requires you 
to fully discharge the battery before recharging it, to ensure that it 
recharges to its full capacity. I recommend you steer clear of NiCd 
batteries — unless you happen to have some lying around and 
want to get your money’s worth.
