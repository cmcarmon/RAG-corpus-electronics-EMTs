The output of the mixer is directly coupled to the mixer amplifier. The IF signal is then directed 
through one of four bandwidth filters to the first IF amplifier. The signal proceeds to the second and third 
IF amplifiers for amplification before demodulation. An IF buffer amplifier is used to pass the IF to the IF 
OUT jack and to isolate this jack from the rest of the circuitry.
