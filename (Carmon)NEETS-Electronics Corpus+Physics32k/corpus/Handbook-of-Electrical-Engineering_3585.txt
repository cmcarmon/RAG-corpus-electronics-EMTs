Silicon compilation: Synthesis application that generates Ô¨Ånal physical design ready for silicon fabrication.
Simulation: Computer program that examines the dynamic semantics of a model of a digital system by applying
a series of inputs and generating the corresponding outputs. Major types of simulation include schedule
driven, cycle driven, and message driven.
