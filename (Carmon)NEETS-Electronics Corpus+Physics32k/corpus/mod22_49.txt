In 1950, the UNIVAC I was developed. This machine was usually regarded as the most successful 
electronic data processor of its day. An outstanding feature of the UNIVAC I was that it checked its own 
results in each step of a problem; thus eliminating the need to run the problems more than once to ensure 
accuracy.
