Twin Clutch SST (Sport- or Sportronic Shift Transmission) is the brand name of a six-speed dual clutch transmission developed by Getrag for Mitsubishi Motors. The system was first incorporated in the 2008 Lancer Evolution X, and was designed to be a more performance-oriented system than that developed by rival manufacturers, with shorter gear ratios optimized for acceleration.
