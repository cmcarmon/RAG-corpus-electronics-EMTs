Any one of the intersections ΛP•F of a horizontal strip with a vertical strip, where P and F are sequences of As and Bs, is an affine transformation of a small region in V1. If P has k symbols in it, and if  f −k(ΛP•F) and ΛP•F intersect, the region ΛP•F will have a fixed point. This happens when the sequence P is the same as F. For example, ΛABAB•ABAB ⊂ V4 ∩ H4 has at least one fixed point. This point is also the same as the fixed point in ΛAB•AB. By including more and more ABs in the P and F part of the label of intersection, the area of the intersection can be made as small as needed. It converges to a point that is part of a periodic orbit of the horseshoe map. The periodic orbit can be labeled by the simplest sequence of As and Bs that labels one of the regions the periodic orbit visits.
For every sequence of As and Bs there is a periodic orbit.
