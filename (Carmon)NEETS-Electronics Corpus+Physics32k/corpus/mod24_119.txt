Two types of rays can propagate along an optical fiber. The first type is called meridional rays.
Meridional rays are rays that pass through the axis of the optical fiber. Meridional rays are used to
illustrate the basic transmission properties of optical fibers. The second type is called skew rays. Skew
rays are rays that travel through an optical fiber without passing through its axis.
