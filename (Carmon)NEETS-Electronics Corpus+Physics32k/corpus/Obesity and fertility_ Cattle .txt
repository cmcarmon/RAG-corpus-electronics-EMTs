It is common practise for body condition scoring to be used in domesticated animals to assess the fatness of an animal and is often used by vets and livestock handlers to determine whether the animal need more or less energy. Both a low and a high score can negatively impact an animalâ€™s fertility.
Cattle that are over-conditioned are also more insulin resistant compared to their leaner counterparts. As demonstrated in mice, insulin resistance is a factor in poor fertility as it has an effect on oocyte development. This in turn means that less oocytes are suitable for fertilisation and fertility is impaired.
Another reason for decrease in fertility is to do with leptin. Leptin is a hormone which production is increased in obese animals. In cows, leptin can inhibit thecal cells from producing adrostenediol and progesterone. Androstenediol is important in fertility as it is the precursor to oestrogen. Without oestrogen production, the balance of hormones is affected and there is no LH surge with is required for ovulation.
