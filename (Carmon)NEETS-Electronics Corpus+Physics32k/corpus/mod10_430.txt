Another type of copper loss is due to SKIN EFFECT. When dc flows through a conductor, the
movement of electrons through the conductor's cross section is uniform. The situation is somewhat
different when ac is applied. The expanding and collapsing fields about each electron encircle other
electrons. This phenomenon, called SELF INDUCTION, retards the movement of the encircled electrons.
