period of the fundamental frequency to be rejected. The maximum conversion rate is slightly less than 1/(2T)
conversions  per  second. While  this  limits  the  conversion  rate  to  be  too  slow  for  high-speed  data  acquisition
applications, it is appropriate for long-duration applications of slowly varying input signals.
