Comparing the quadrupole moment of different arenes is a useful qualitative tool to predict trends in cation-π binding, since it roughly correlates with interaction strength. Arenes with larger quadrupole moments are generally better at binding cations.
However, a quadrupole-ion model system cannot be used to quantitatively model cation-π interactions. Such models assume point charges, and are therefore not valid given the short cation-π bond distance. In order to use electrostatics to predict energies, the full electrostatic potential surface must be considered, rather than just the quadrupole moment as a point charge.
