markings inside it, as in Figure 1.26b. If the voltage source supplies a voltage V,
then we also include the V symbol inside the circle (or just outside the circle if
there is not enough room to write the symbol inside). In the same manner, we
might also represent an information source, such as a microphone or a sensor, as
a voltage source providing a time-varying voltage v(t) at its output (Figure 1.26c).
We can assume that the voltage v(t) depends solely on the microphone signal
and is independent of the amount of current drawn from the terminals. (Note
that V and v(t) in Figure 1.26 are element values and not terminal variables.)
