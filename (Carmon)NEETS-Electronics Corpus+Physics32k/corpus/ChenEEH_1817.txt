Disadvantages of the IntServ Service Model for the Internet
IntServ uses RSVP to make per-ﬂow reservations at routers
along a network path. Although this allows the network to
provide service guarantees at the ﬂow level, it causes it to suffer
from scalability problems. The routers have to maintain per-
ﬂow state for every ﬂow that passes through the router, which
can lead to huge overhead. Moreover, RSVP is a soft-state
protocol, which means that the router state has to be refreshed
at regular intervals. This increases trafﬁc overhead.
