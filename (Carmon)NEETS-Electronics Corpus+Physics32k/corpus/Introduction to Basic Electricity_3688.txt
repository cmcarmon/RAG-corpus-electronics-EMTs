When the input voltage increases through the tran-
sistor, the voltage out also tries to increase. The base 
voltage is set by the zener diode. If the emitter becomes 
more positive than the base, the conductance of the tran-
sistor decreases. When the transistor conducts less, it 
 reacts the same way a large resistor would react if placed 
between the input and output. Most of the  increase in 
input voltage is dropped across the transistor, and there 
is only a small increase in the output voltage.
