The four ports of a hybrid or a coupler are labeled as input,
direct, coupled, and isolated. Suppose that P1 is the power fed
into port l, while P2, P3, and P4 denote the power available at
the other corresponding ports. Then, four important param-
eters that describe the electrical performance of this passive
circuit are deÔ¨Åned as follows:
