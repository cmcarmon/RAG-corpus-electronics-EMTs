Another example of nonlinear current conduction is through gases such as air. At standard
temperatures and pressures, air is an effective insulator. However, if the voltage between two
conductors separated by an air gap is increased greatly enough, the air molecules between the
gap will become ”ionized,” having their electrons stripped off by the force of the high voltage
between the wires. Once ionized, air (and other gases) become good conductors of electricity,
allowing electron ﬂow where none could exist prior to ionization. If we were to plot current over
voltage on a graph as we did with the lamp circuit, the effect of ionization would be clearly seen
as nonlinear:
