found such a code. Shannon’s result proves it exists; seems like there is always more work to do. In any case,
that should not prevent us from studying commonly used error correcting codes that not only ﬁnd their way
into all digital communication systems, but also into CDs and bar codes used on merchandise.
6.25 Repetition Codes33
Perhaps the simplest error correcting code is the repetition code. Here, the transmitter sends the data
bit several times, an odd number of times in fact. Because the error probability pe is always less than 1
2, we
know that more of the bits should be correct rather than in error. Simple majority voting of the received
bits (hence the reason for the odd number) determines the transmitted bit more accurately than sending
it alone. For example, let’s consider the three-fold repetition code: for every bit b (n) emerging from the
source coder, the channel coder produces three. Thus, the bit stream emerging from the channel coder c (l)
has a data rate three times higher than that of the original bit stream b (n). The coding table (Table 1.1)
illustrates when the majority-vote decoder can correct errors and when it can’t.
