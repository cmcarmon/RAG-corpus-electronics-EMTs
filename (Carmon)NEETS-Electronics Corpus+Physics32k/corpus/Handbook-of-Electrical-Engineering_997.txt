3. Draw devices in pairs. That is, if the wide-long device is W/L = 20/20, make the wide-short device the
same width as the wide-long device; e.g., make the short device 20/1, not 19/1. If the narrow-long device
is 2/20, make the narrow-short device of the same width; i.e., make is 2/1, not 3/1, and similarly for the
lengths. (Make the wide-short and the narrow-short devices have the same length.)
