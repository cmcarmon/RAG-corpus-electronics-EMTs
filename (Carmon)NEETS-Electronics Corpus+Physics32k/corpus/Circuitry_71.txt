This  chapter 
the  most 
common  types  of  electronic  component,  including 
resistors, capacitors and inductors. These are often 
referred to as passive  components  as they cannot, 
by  themselves,  generate  voltage  or  current.  An 
understanding of the characteristics and application 
of  passive  components  is  an  essential  prerequisite 
to understanding the operation of the circuits used 
in amplifiers, oscillators, filters and power supplies.
