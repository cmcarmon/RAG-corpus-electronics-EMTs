Any mass on earth is pulled down by the gravitational force of the earth; this force is also called its weight. The corresponding 'reaction' is the gravitational force that mass exerts on the planet.
If the object is supported so that it remains at rest, for instance by a cable from which it is hanging, or by a surface underneath, or by a liquid on which it is floating, there is also a support force in upward direction (tension force, normal force, buoyant force, respectively). This support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's Third Law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced.
To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:
F1. gravitational force by earth on object (downward)
F2. gravitational force by object on earth (upward)
F3. force by support on object (upward)
F4. force by object on support (downward)
Forces F1 and F2 are equal because of Newton's Third Law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. Forces F1 and F3 are only equal if the object is in equilibrium, and no other forces are applied. This has nothing to do with Newton's Third Law.
