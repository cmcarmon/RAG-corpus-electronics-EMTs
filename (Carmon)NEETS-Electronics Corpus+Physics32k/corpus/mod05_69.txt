The core of a generator armature is made from soft iron, which is a conducting material with 
desirable magnetic characteristics. Any conductor will have currents induced in it when it is rotated in a 
magnetic field. These currents that are induced in the generator armature core are called EDDY 
CURRENTS. The power dissipated in the form of heat, as a result of the eddy currents, is considered a 
loss.
