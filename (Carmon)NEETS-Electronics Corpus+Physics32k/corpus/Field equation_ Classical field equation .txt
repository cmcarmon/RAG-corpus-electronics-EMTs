Classical field equations arise in continuum mechanics (including elastodynamics and fluid mechanics), heat transfer, electromagnetism, and gravitation.
Fundamental classical field equations include
Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation for nonrelativistic gravitation.
Einstein field equations for relativistic gravitation
Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.
Important equations derived from fundamental laws include:
Navierâ€“Stokes equations for fluid flow.
As part of real-life mathematical modelling processes, classical field equations are accompanied by other equations of motion, equations of state, constitutive equations, and continuity equations.
