Suppose a capacitor is hooked up across one of the stator coils of a TDX and its capacitance is 
adjusted so that its reactance equals the reactance of the coil. Since the two reactances are equal, the 
current they draw from the line must also be equal. However, these currents are going to be 180ยบ out of 
phase, because the current in the coil lags the line voltage, while the capacitor's current leads it. Since the 
two currents are equal in magnitude but opposite in phase, they cancel. The total line current is reduced 
by this effect and, if a capacitor is placed across each coil in the TDX, the line current decreases even 
further. This, in effect, increases torque in synchro systems near the point of correspondence and, 
therefore, increases overall system accuracy.
