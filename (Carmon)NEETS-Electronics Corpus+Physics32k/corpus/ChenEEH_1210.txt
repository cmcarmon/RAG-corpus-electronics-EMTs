With technology scaling, noise is a problem affecting all
types of designs from custom microprocessors to standard-
cell application-speciÔ¨Åc integrated circuit (ASICs). A noise
analysis solution must be capable of analyzing tens of millions
of transistors, considering both circuit and interconnect noise,
and evaluating the distinct noise tolerances of each node in the
circuit.
