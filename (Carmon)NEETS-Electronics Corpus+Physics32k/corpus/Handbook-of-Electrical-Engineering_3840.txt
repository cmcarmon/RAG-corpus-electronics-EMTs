This radiation resistance is considerably higher than the radiation resistance of a short dipole. For example, if
we have a dipole of length 0.01l, its radiation resistance will be approximately 0.08 W (from Eq. 38.9). This
resistance is probably comparable to the ohmic resistance of the dipole, thereby resulting in a low efﬁciency.
The half-wave dipole, having a much higher radiation resistance, will have much higher efﬁciency. The higher
resistance of the half-wave dipole also makes impedance matching easier.
