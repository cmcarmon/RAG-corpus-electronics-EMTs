The optical power meter measures current by converting light power from plug-in units, such as light
emitting diodes, into electrical current. In some models, the readout is in power units, watts. In other
models, the readout is in absolute power levels and attenuation. Some units operate with a variety of
power sensors for conventional coaxial and waveguide systems and fiber-optic systems.
