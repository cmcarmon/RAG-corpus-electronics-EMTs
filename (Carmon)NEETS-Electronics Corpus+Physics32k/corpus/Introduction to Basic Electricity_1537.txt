To repeat, energy introduced into a circuit is called 
a voltage rise. Energy used up in a circuit by the load 
is called a voltage drop. A voltage drop occurs when 
there is a current flow in the circuit. Current moves 
through a circuit from the negative polarity to the 
positive polarity. The voltage source establishes the 
voltage rise from the negative terminal to the positive 
terminal.
