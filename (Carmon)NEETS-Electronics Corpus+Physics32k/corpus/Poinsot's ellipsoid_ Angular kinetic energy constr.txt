The law of conservation of energy implies that in the absence of energy dissipation or applied torques, the angular kinetic energy



T



{\displaystyle T\ }
is conserved, so

The angular kinetic energy may be expressed in terms of the moment of inertia tensor




I



{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} }
and the angular velocity vector

; in the principal axis frame, it must lie on an ellipsoid, called inertia ellipsoid.
The ellipsoid axes values are the half of the principal moments of inertia. The path traced out on this ellipsoid by the angular velocity vector

is called the polhode (coined by Poinsot from Greek roots for "pole path") and is generally circular or taco-shaped.
