The critical virtue of the Daniels Escapement is the virtual elimination of the sliding friction component; i.e., the sliding of the pallet stones over the teeth of the escape wheel. What little sliding friction remains is due to the impossibility of maintaining an exact tangential geometry throughout the duration of an impulse.
