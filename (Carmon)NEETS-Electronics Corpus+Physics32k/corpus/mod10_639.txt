Notice that the rotating axis is always drawn from the center of the graph to some position on the 
edge of the graph. As the axis moves toward the edge of the graph, it passes through a set of 
equally-spaced, concentric circles. In this example view B, they are numbered successively from 1 to 10 
from the center out. These circles are used to indicate the magnitude of the radiation.
