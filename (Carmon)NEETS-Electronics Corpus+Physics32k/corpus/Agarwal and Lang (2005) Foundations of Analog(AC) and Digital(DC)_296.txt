While the two examples of circuit analysis presented here are admittedly
very simple, they nonetheless illustrate the basic steps of circuit analysis: label
the branch variables, assemble the element laws, apply KCL and KVL, and
solve the resulting equations for the branch variables of interest. While we will
not always follow these steps explicitly and in exactly the same order in future
chapters, it is important to know that we will nonetheless process exactly the
same information.
