Effects of Changes in the Task Variables
The  task  variable  which  has  the  most  important  effect  on  the  trained  operator’s  behavior  is  the  controlled
element dynamics. Indeed, the natures of human adaptive changes in adjusting to the controlled element is the
main thrust of the crossover model and remnant discussion above. More generally, task variables other than
the  machine  dynamics,  as  well  as  environmental  and  operator-centered  variables,  can  change  operator  gain,
t
  variations  become
and  hence  crossover  frequency,  effective  time  delay,  and  remnant.  Accordingly, 
quantiﬁcation measures of changes or differences in the task, environmental, and operator-centered variables
expressed directly in terms of the operator’s control actions.
