If a d.c. voltage is applied to the control winding of a saturable-core reactor and an a.c. voltage is
applied to the load windings, the a.c. flux will aid the d.c. flux on one half cycle and oppose the d.c. flux
on the other half cycle. This is shown in figure 3-35. Load flux is indicated by the dashed-line arrows, and
control flux is indicated by the solid-line arrows. View (A) shows the load and control flux adding during
one half cycle of the a.c. View (B) of the figure shows the load and control flux opposing during the other
half cycle of the a.c.
