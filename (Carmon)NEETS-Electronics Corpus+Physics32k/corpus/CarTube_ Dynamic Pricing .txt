The CarTube could be run on a dynamic pricing model, allowing fees charged to vary, according to the evolving needs of a city like London. This could include varied tariffs depending on the time of travel, or reduced fares for cars carrying a minimum number of three passengers. Users could for example be able to book a CarTube trip through their smartphones using either their own cars or public cars. The CarTube app will calculate a fare and an estimated arrival time based on an optimal route through the network.
