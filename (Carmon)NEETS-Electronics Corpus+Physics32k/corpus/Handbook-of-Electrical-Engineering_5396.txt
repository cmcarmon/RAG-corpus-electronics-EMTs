Optical Control of Sub-bandgap Energies
Advances in selective emitters provided a major inﬂuence in rekindling interest in TPV development. Several
investigators have shown the utility of rare-earth oxides such at holmia, ytterbia, erbia in modifying the emission
spectrum from a broad band to one that selectively emits a substantial portion of the energy in a narrow band
around a characteristic resonant frequency. Ytterbia emits with good selectivity at a peak wavelength of 980 nm
— close to the bandgap of silicon (1070 nm). Given the relative maturity, efﬁciency, and low cost of silicon
solar cells, development of an effective ytterbia emitter and surrounding system for use of silicon converters
presents a pathway with potential for good performance and quick development for TPV. Unfortunately, the
bulk properties of the substrate for these materials also contribute to the total radiation. Even a very low value
of out-of-band emissivity integrated over a broad spectrum presents unacceptable losses. Mantles, similar to
those  used  in  camping  lanterns,  alleviate  this  loss  by  eliminating  most  of  the  bulk  of  the  support  structure.
Nelson was the ﬁrst to observe that ﬁbrous emitters for TPV systems yield the same improvement [7]. However,
it  is  difﬁcult  to  scale  the  mantle  structure  to  larger  sizes  and  maintain  acceptable  mechanical  performance.
Several solutions for design of mechanically robust emitters are in development. One example uses selectively
emitting ﬁbers embedded in a ported ceramic block that allows the radiating ﬁbers to work within the ﬂame
while the ceramic substrate remains relatively cool.
