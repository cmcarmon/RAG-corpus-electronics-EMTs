Micromirrors are also at the heart of optical signal routers
for a coming generation of the Internet that will contain ‘‘all
optical’’ components. Optical ﬁbers can carry more than one
hundred signals using different photon wavelengths (‘‘colors’’).
Switching this ﬂood of information requires converting the
light signals for each color to electronic signals, manipulating
them and regenerating light pulses for continued transmission
down other ﬁbers. The great advantage of MEMS mirrors for
ﬁber network switches is that switching can be done entirely in
the optical domain. There is no need to turn the optical signals
into electrical signals for routing and then to produce other
light pulses for further transmission. Hence, this is called ‘‘all
optical’’ networking (even though the production and de-
tection of the light bundles still involves electronics!). The
MEMS approach is faster and requires less hardware. During
the year 2000, because of the explosive growth of the Internet,
six small MEMS companies were bought by suppliers of
hardware for ﬁber communications systems. Two of them
sold for $750 million, one went for $1.25 billion, and another
sold for $3.25 billion (with all of these values in stock prices
