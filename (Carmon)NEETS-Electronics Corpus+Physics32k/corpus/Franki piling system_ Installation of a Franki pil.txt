A charge of zero-slump concrete is poured into the bottom of a steel driving pipe that is placed vertically on the ground. A diesel-operated drop hammer is then driven on the concrete, forming a watertight concrete plug.
The concrete plug is driven into the ground by the drop hammer. The pipe is also dragged into the ground due to friction developed between the steel and the concrete.
When the desired depth is reached, the pipe is held in position by leadsâ€”structures which guide and align the pile and hammer. The hammer is then applied to the concrete, driving it outwards through the bottom of the pile and forming a mushroom-shaped base.
At this point, a cylindrical rebar cage can be driven into the concrete if supplementary reinforcement is desired.
Additional charges of concrete are added and driven while the steel casing is simultaneously pulled up until the shaft of the pile is formed.
