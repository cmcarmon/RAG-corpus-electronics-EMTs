A proof mass or test mass is a known quantity of mass used in a measuring instrument as a reference for the measurement of an unknown quantity.
A proof mass that deforms a spring in an accelerometer is sometimes called the seismic mass. Alternative of solid proof mass is a fluid proof mass as employed in convective accelerometers.
A mass used to calibrate a weighing scale is sometimes called a calibration mass or calibration weight.
