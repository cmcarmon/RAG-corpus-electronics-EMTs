Source data or raw data is typically written on some type of paper document, which we refer to as a 
source document. The data contained on the source document must be converted into a machine-readable 
form for processing either by direct or indirect means. The data may be entered directly into the computer 
in its original form; namely right from the source document on which it is recorded by way of magnetic 
ink characters, optically recognizable characters, or bar code recognition. Or the data on the documents 
may be entered indirectly on input media, such as punched cards, paper tape, magnetic tape, or magnetic 
disk. It may also be keyed directly into a computer from a keyboard.
