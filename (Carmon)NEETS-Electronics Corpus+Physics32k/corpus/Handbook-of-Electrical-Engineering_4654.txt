Figure  47.3  shows  a  typical  time  domain  and  frequency  domain  device  performance  speciﬁcation.  The  basic
frequency domain speciﬁcation describes frequency bands and their desired level with respect to a given reference.
Time domain speciﬁcations normally deﬁne the desired impulse response shape and any spurious time responses.
The overall desired speciﬁcation may be deﬁned by combinations of both time and frequency domain speciﬁcations.
Since time,
