As illustrated in view B of figure 4-1, the first section is the TRANSFORMER. The transformer 
steps up or steps down the input line voltage and isolates the power supply from the power line. The 
RECTIFIER section converts the alternating current input signal to a pulsating direct current. However, as 
you proceed in this chapter you will learn that pulsating dc is not desirable. For this reason a FILTER 
section is used to convert pulsating dc to a purer, more desirable form of dc voltage.
