Potentiometers  (variable  resistors)  are  also 
 imprinted with their values (Figure 13â€‘17). These 
may be their actual values or an alphanumeric code. 
With the alphanumeric code system, the resistance 
value is determined from the last part of the code. For 
 example, in MTC253L4, the number 253 means 25
