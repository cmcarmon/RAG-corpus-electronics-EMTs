Optical Properties and Recombination Processes
If the energy of an incident photon \w  > Eg, then the energy conservation law permits a direct band-to-band
transition, as indicated in Fig. 22.2(b). Because the photon’s momentum is negligible compared to that of an
electron  or  hole,  the  electron’s  momentum  \k  does  not  change  in  a  direct  transition.  Consequently,  direct
transitions are possible only in direct-gap semiconductors where the conduction band minimum and the valence
band maximum occur at the same k. The same is true for the reverse transition, where the electron is transferred
