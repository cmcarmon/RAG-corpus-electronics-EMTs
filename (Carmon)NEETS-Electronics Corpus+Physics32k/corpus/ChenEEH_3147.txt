If the conductor diameter is inadequate to prevent corona,
the remedial measures to ﬁx the situation, although available,
are very expensive. These include increasing the number of
conductors per phase, applying special surface treatment of
conductors, and isolating line sections with ﬁlters. Therefore, it
is important to ensure that the conductor details are chosen
after a careful review.
