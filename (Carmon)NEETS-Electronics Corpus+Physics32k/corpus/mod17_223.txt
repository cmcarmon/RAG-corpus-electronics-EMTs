In some cases high sensitivity may be undesirable. For example, letâ€™s suppose the signals received from a
nearby station are strong enough to overload the rf sections of your receiver. This may cause the audio
output to become distorted to the point of complete loss of intelligibility. To overcome this problem, you
can use manual gain control of the rf section. By using the manual gain control, you can adjust the
receiver for maximum sensitivity and amplify weak input signals. When you receive a strong input signal,
