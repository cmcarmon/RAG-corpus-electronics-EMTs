Physically, this equation tells us that the net outward ﬂux of J
per unit volume at every point must vanish. In other words,
the electric current density J acts like an incompressible ﬂuid.
Applying the divergence theorem (Paul et al., 1998) to
equation 1.22 gives the integral form of the static continuity
equation as:
