The transmission losses just discussed are not the only factors that interfere with communications. 
An additional factor that can interfere with radio communications is the presence of 
ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (EMI). This interference can result in annoying or impossible 
operating conditions. Sources of emi are both man-made and natural.
