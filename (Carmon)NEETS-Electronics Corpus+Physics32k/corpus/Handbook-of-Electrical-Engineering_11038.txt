Rapid,  deep  breathing  (hyperventilation)  at  a  rate  of  30  per
minute  for  about  3  min  reduces  the  partial  pressure  of  carbon
dioxide in the blood which reduces cerebral blood ï¬‚ow. A typical
EEG response consists of large-amplitude, bilaterally synchronous,
frontally prominent waves with a frequency of 4 to 7 per second.
The frequency usually decreases with increasing hyperventilation.
The lack of bilateral symmetry is an indication of abnormality.
