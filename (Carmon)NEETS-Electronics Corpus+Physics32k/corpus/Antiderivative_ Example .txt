The function F(x) = x3/3 is an antiderivative of f(x) = x2, as the derivative of x3/3 is x2. As the derivative of a constant is zero, x2 will have an infinite number of antiderivatives, such as x3/3, x3/3 + 1, x3/3 - 2, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of x2 can be obtained by changing the value of C in F(x) = x3/3 + C; where C is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration. Essentially, the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are vertical translations of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the value of C.
In physics, the integration of acceleration yields velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity because the derivative of a constant term is zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity, acceleration, and so on).
