Cathode ray tube: A vacuum tube which uses cathode rays to generate a picture on a ﬂuorescent screen. These
cathode  rays  are  in  fact  the  electron  beam  deﬂected  and  modulated,  which  impinges  on  a  phosphor
screen to generate a picture according to a repetitive pattern refreshed at a frequency usually between 25
and 72 Hz. The term cathode rays stems from the discovery by Plücker [1858] and Hittorf [1869] of a
blue glow present at some spots on a glass tube when studying high-voltage discharge in a low-pressure
gas. Crookes [1879] showed that these cathode rays were deﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld and were in fact
electrons emitted by the negative electrode. The more poetic term cathode rays has been kept instead of
electron beam for the cathode ray tube.
