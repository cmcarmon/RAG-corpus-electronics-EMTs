In addition to the above cable designs, there are numerous other cable designs used for speciﬁc applications,
such as ﬁre-resistant cables, military tactical cables, cables for missile guidance systems, cables for ﬁeld com-
munications established by air-drop operations, air deployment cables, and cables for industrial controls. All
these applications have unique requirements, such as ruggedness, low loss, and repeaterless spans, and the cable
designs are accordingly selected. However, all these cable designs still rely on the basic unit designs discussed
above.
