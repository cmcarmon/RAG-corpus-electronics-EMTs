The time-evolution operator U(t, t0) is defined as the operator which acts on the ket at time t0 to produce the ket at some other time t:

ψ
(
t
)
⟩
=
U
(
t
,

t

0


)

|

ψ
(

t

0


)
⟩
.


{\displaystyle |\psi (t)\rangle =U(t,t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle .}

For bras, we instead have




⟨
ψ
(
t
)

=
⟨
ψ
(

t

.


{\displaystyle \langle \psi (t)|=\langle \psi (t_{0})|U^{\dagger }(t,t_{0}).}
