The decomposition method also requires O(N 3) operations. It
is about three times faster, however, than the direct inversion.
Once the system matrix is inverted or factorized, the solution
for a new source vector {b} can be obtained easily. Therefore,
the inversion and factorization methods are suitable for cases
when the solution is sought for many right-hand sides. This is
their major advantage.
