Remarks
For convenience of implementation, the steady-state solution
obtained in the limit as tf ! 1 is used. The LQG control
design is optimized to reject white noise disturbances; how-
ever, it can be modiﬁed to handle constant disturbances via
feed-forward and integral control. The selection of gains in
the feed-forward case can be done in a similar way as in the
case of tracking system design. Prior to implementation, the
robustness of LQG designs needs to be evaluated since there is
no guarantee that any useful robustness will be obtained. For
constant disturbance rejection via integral control, one needs
to use integral Kalman ﬁlter and also integral state feedback.
