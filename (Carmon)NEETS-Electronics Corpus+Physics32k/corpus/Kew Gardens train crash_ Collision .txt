Meanwhile, the brakeman on the Hempstead train signalled to his engineer that he was back aboard and the train could proceed, but he did not receive any response; he signalled again but the train stayed where it was. He prepared to get back onto the track when the Babylon train hit. Before he was killed the Babylon train's engineer applied the emergency brake but it was still travelling at 30 mph (48 km/h) when it collided with the stationary train.
Neither train derailed; the impact pushed the stationary train forward 75 feet (23 m) and split its last car lengthwise as the front car of the Babylon train telescoped into it, shearing off the superstructure above the floor and driving the roof 15 feet (4.6 m) into the air. In the ensuing collision, 78 people were killed and 363 were injured; one witness described the dead as "packed like sardines in their own blood". A survivor recounted: "All I could see was parts of bodies, arms and legs protruding from the windows". Many of those who survived the impact were trapped in the darkness; unable to move in the pileup of dead bodies, amidst the screams and wails of the dying. Help soon came, but it was more than five hours before the last people still alive were removed from the wreckage.
