the frequency where the magnitude of the open-loop gain is 1, is 100 rad/s. The PM for the system without
equalization is zero. We will design a simple lead network compensation for this zero PM system. If uncom-
pensated, the closed-loop transfer function will be such that the system is unstable and any disturbance at all
will result in a sinusoidally oscillating output.
