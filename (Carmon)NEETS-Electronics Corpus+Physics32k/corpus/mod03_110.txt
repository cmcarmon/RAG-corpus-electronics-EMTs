In complex electrical circuits, you are not always concerned with total circuit current. You may be
interested in the current through a particular component or group of components. In any case, an ammeter
is always connected in series with the circuit you wish to test. Figure 1-20 shows various circuit
arrangements with the ammeter(s) properly connected for measuring current in various portions of the
circuit.
