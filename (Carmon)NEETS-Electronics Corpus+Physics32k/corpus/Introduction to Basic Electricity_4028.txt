A phase-shift	oscillator is a conventional am-
plifier with a phase-shifting RC feedback network 
(Figure 39-11). The feedback must shift the signal 
180Â°. Because the capacitive reactance changes with a 
change in frequency, it is frequency sensitive. Stabil-
ity is improved by reducing the amount of phase shift 
across each RC network. However, there is a power 
loss across the combined RC network. The transistor 
must have enough gain to offset these losses.
