h i g h - q c i r c u i t The circuit shown in Figure 14.37 is a resonant circuit
driven by a 1-Volt cosinusoidal voltage source. We wish to find: (a) the frequency
at which the capacitor voltage vC has its largest amplitude, and the value of that ampli-
tude; (b) the undamped resonance frequency (or, simply, resonance frequency) of the
circuit, and the amplitude of vC at that frequency; (c) the damped resonance frequency
of the circuit, and the amplitude of vC at that frequency; (d) the amplitude of vC at the
frequency of 1 kHz; and (e) the amplitude of vC at the frequency of 100 kHz. To carry
out the analysis, we first determine Vc, the complex amplitude of vC, and then take its
magnitude. The magnitude of Vc is the amplitude of vC in sinusoidal steady state. Using
impedances, the magnitude of the complex amplitude Vc is given by:
