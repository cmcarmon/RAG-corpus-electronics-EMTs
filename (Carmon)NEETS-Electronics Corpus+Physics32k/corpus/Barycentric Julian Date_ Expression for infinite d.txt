{\displaystyle BJD_{TT}=JD_{TT}+{\frac {{\vec {r}}\cdot {\hat {n}}}{c}}}

This expression should be used for objects beyond the Solar System. The error is at the level of 100 s for objects in the main asteroid belt, 5 s for Edgeworth-Kuiper Belt objects. At the distance of Proxima Centauri the accuracy is 1 ms.
