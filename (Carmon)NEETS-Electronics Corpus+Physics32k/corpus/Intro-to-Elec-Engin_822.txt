Most electric energy has been generated by steam-powered (accounting for about 85% of
U.S. generation) and by water-powered, or hydro, turbine plants (accounting for about 10% of
U.S. generation). Gas turbines are also used for short periods to meet peak loads. Steam plants
are fueled primarily by coal, gas, oil, and uranium. While coal is the most widely used fuel in
the United States, due to its abundance, nuclear units of 1280-MW steam-turbine capacity are
in service today. However, rising construction costs, licensing delays, and public concerns have
stopped the growth of nuclear capacity in the United States.
