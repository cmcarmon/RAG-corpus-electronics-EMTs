BRST construction applies to a situation of a hamiltonian action of a compact, connected Lie group G on a phase space M. Let





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
be the Lie algebra of G and



0

g

{\displaystyle 0\in {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
a regular value of the moment map



Φ

{\displaystyle \Phi :M\to {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
. Let




M

{\displaystyle M_{0}=\Phi ^{-1}(0)}
. Assume the G-action on M0 is free and proper, and consider the space

{\displaystyle {\widetilde {M}}=M_{0}/G}
of G-orbits on M0, which is also known as a Symplectic reduction quotient

{\displaystyle {\widetilde {M}}=M//G}

First, using the regular sequence of functions defining M0 inside M, construct a Koszul complex

{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\cdot }{\mathfrak {g}}\otimes C^{\infty }(M).}

The differential, δ, on this complex is an odd C∞(M)-linear derivation of the graded C∞(M)-algebra

{\displaystyle \Lambda ^{\cdot }{\mathfrak {g}}\otimes C^{\infty }(M)}

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}\to C^{\infty }(M)}
of the hamiltonian action. The resulting Koszul complex is the Koszul complex of the

-module C∞(M), where



S

{\displaystyle S({\mathfrak {g}})}
is the symmetric algebra of

This Koszul complex is a resolution of the
