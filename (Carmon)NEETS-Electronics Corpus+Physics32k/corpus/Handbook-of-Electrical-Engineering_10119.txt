Gantry robots can be applied in many areas. They are used in the nuclear power industry to load and unload
reactor fuel rods. Gantry robots are also applied to materials-handling tasks, such as parts transfer, machine
loading, palletizing, materials transport, and some assembly applications. In addition, gantry robots are used
for  process  applications  such  as  welding,  painting,  drilling,  routing,  cutting,  milling,  inspection,  and  nonde-
structive testing.
