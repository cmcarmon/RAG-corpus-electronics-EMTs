In the earlier discussion of conventional-electron tubes, you learned some of the limitations of tubes.
One of these limitations was that the conventional tube was not able to operate (amplify) at extremely
high frequencies such as those used in radar equipment. Even at frequencies lower than those used in
radar equipment, problems occur. For example, at ultrahigh frequencies (300 MHz to 3000 MHz), transit
time effects make the operation of a conventional-electron tube impossible. For this reason, the special
ultrahigh frequency tubes were developed to operate within this frequency range.
