The above algorithm for calculating the output of the simpli-
ﬁed partial linearization controller takes full advantage of the
recursive nature of the design equations, reducing the number
of states and ﬂoating-point computations. Furthermore, the
simpliﬁed form is amenable to the construction of general
software routines, capable of computing the controller output
for an arbitrary value of the controller order n.
