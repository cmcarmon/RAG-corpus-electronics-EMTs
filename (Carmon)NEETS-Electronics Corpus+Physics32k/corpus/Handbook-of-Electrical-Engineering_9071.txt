Daisywheel Printing. This technology makes use of a “petal-like” rotating print wheel with typically 96 spring-
like  ﬁngers  or “petals”  radiating  outward  from  a  central  core. An  engraved  raised  character  is  present  at  the
end of each petal. The wheel is rotated by a dc servomotor to the desired character. A single hammer-actuator
then  impacts  the  back  side  of  the  petal,  forcing  the  raised  character  into  the  ribbon/paper  set.  The  simplest
designs  have  a  constant  carriage  speed  and  a  ﬁxed  time  delay  to  allow  for  up  to  180(cid:176)  rotation  of  the  wheel
between  strokes.  These  systems  are  typically  limited  to  about  30  characters  per  second  (cps).  More  modern
designs  have  incorporated  microcode  logic  which  slow  down  the  carriage  motor  when  the  next  character
position is more than, for example, 30(cid:176) away. This can increase the net average speed to as high as 60 cps.
