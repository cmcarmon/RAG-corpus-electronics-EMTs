When a TE10 wave becomes incident at port 3, its electric
Ô¨Åeld is parallel to the broadwall of arm 4 in which it is below
cutoff. Hence, no power is directed into that arm. Arms 1 and
2, however, receive once again equal powers that are 180 out
of phase in this case (provided both arms are of equal length).
If ports 3 and 4 are both matched, the amplitude of all four
phasors is the same. Provided all arms are of equal length, the
signals add at port 1 and cancel at port 2. Arms 3 and 4 are
decoupled. The magic tee is described by the following sym-
metrical S-matrix:
