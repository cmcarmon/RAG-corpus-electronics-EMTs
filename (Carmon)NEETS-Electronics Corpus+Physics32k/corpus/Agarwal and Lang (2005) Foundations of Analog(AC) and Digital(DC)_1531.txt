The driving voltage vS = 0 for t < 0. Assume vS is a 3-volt step at t = 0. Make a sketch
of vC(t) for t > 0. Be sure to label the dimensions of the voltage and time axes and
identify characteristic waveform shapes with suitable expressions.

Referring to Figure 10.74, before the switch is closed, the
capacitor is charged to a voltage vS = 2 V. The switch is closed at t = 0. Find an
expression for vC(t) for t > 0. Sketch vC(t).
