When two or more generators are supplying a common load, they are said to be operating in parallel. 
The purpose of connecting generators in parallel is simply to provide more current than a single generator 
is capable of providing. The generators may be physically located quite a distance apart. However, they 
are connected to the common load through the power distribution system.
