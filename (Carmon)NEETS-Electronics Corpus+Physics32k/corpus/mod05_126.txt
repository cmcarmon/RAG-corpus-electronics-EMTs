THE LEFT-HAND RULE FOR GENERATORS states that when the thumb, forefinger, and 
middle finger of the left hand are extended at right angles to each other so that the thumb indicates the 
direction of movement of the conductor in the magnetic field, and the forefinger points in the direction of 
the flux lines (north to south), the middle finger shows the direction of induced emf in the conductor.
