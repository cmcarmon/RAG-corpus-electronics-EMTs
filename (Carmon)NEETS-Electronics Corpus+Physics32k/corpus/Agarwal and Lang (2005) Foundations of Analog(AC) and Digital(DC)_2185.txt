Now, since the capacitor voltage vC is higher than the output voltage, the
capacitor begins to discharge through R3. Figure 15.34 shows that the equiva-
lent circuit that applies. When the capacitor voltage falls below −VSR1/R1+R2,
−
the voltage v
resulting in a positive voltage difference at
the Op Amp input. The Op Amp amplifies this positive difference to a positive
voltage at its output, which when fed back to the non-inverting terminal causes
a larger positive voltage to appear across the Op Amp input. The resulting pos-
itive feedback causes the Op Amp output to go into positive saturation. Thus,
the output voltage reaches VS and that at v
