Higher  draft-quality  speed  (e.g.,  200  cps)  can  be  achieved  without  decreasing  wire  cycle  time  by  simply
increasing the carriage speed. Higher than normal print quality can be accomplished by both slowing down
the carriage and interlacing horizontal rows of dots. This near letter-quality printing is usually at greatly reduced
speed  (e.g.,  48  cps).  Most  printers  also  print  during  the  carriage  return.  Color  can  be  produced  by  shifting
four-color ribbons.
