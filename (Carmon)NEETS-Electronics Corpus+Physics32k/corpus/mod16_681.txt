An attenuator probe has an internal high-value resistor in series with the probe tip. This gives the
probe a higher input impedance than that of the oscilloscope. Because of the higher input impedance, the
probe can measure high-amplitude signals that would overdrive the vertical amplifier if connected
directly to the oscilloscope. Figure 6-41 shows a schematic representation of a basic attenuation probe.
The 9-megohm resistor in the probe and the 1-megohm input resistor of the oscilloscope form a 10-to-1
voltage divider.
