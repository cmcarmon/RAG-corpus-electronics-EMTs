or “molded boot” is shown in Fig. 89.2(a), in which the boot consists of two collapsible domes. In this design,
the internal movement of the keyswitch is completely silent so that some source of sound must be added to
achieve  the  desired  audible  feedback.  The  snap  switch  design  shown  in  Fig. 89.2(b)  has  built-in  sound  and
achieves a small reduction in insertion errors over the elastomer design with audio feedback.
