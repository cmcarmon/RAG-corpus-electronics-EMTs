The Relascope is very similar to the angle gauge and the wedge prism in that it can be used to find the basal area of a tree from a point depending on the basal area factor in a variable radius sampling method. The main difference in this instrument though is that it has multiple uses as described previously. Some other advantages over similar devises in that it accounts for the slope one is from the tree giving a more accurate measurement than similar tools.
The Relascope can also be used to find the distance from a tree (range). This is done in the same manner as when one uses a transit using a set of trigonometric formulae based on height and angle. The Relascope is not commonly used for this because of its difficulty and the amount of time it takes to do this.
Tree height is another use of this instrument. It does this by using several weighted wheels that spin based on the position of the instrument. The readings off of this scale will give the height of the tree based on your position from the tree. When taking height one measures either 66 or 120 feet from the tree this is the reason for the multiple scales in the relascope. When one stands at this distance they look first at the top of the tree or at the highest point on the bole that they want to measure and record the number from the height dial inside the scope, then one looks at the bottom of the tree this will give you a positive or negative number you take this number and subtract it from the first number one recorded this is one's height of the tree. This is very similar to the way a clinometer is used.
