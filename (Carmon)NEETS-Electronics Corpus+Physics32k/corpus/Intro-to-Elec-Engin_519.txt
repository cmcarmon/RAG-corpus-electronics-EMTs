Sequential Blocks
Neglecting propagation delays, which are measures of how long it takes the output of a gate to
respond to a transition at the input of the gate, the output of a logic block at a given time depends
only on the inputs at that same time. The output of a sequential block, on the other hand, depends
not only on the present inputs but also on inputs at earlier times. Sequential blocks have thus a
kind of memory, and some of them are used as computer memories.
