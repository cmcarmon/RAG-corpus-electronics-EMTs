Discrete  questions.  If  X  is  a  discrete  random  variable  that  takes  values  in  some  ﬁnite  alphabet  R,  then  a
question about X has the form: Is X an element of S where S is a subset of R? Typically, questions are of the
form “Is the preceding phone a vowel?” or “Is the following phone an unvoiced stop?”
