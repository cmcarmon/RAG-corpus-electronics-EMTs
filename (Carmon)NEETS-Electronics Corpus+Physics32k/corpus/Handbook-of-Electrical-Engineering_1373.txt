The  most  fundamental  model  for  speech  signals  is  the  Gaussian  autoregressive (AR) model. This  model
assumes that each 20- to 40-msec segment of the signal is generated from an excitation signal which is applied
to a linear time-invariant all-pole ﬁlter. The excitation signal comprises a mixture of white Gaussian noise and
a periodic sequence of impulses. The period of that sequence is determined by the pitch period of the speech
signal. This model is described in Fig. 15.2. Generally, the excitation signal represents the ﬂow of air through
the vocal cords and the all-pole ﬁlter represents the vocal tract. The model for a given sample function of speech
