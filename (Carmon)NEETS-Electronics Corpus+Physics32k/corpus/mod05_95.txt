By proportioning the two fields so that the decrease in the shunt field is just compensated by the 
increase in the series field, the output voltage remains constant. This is shown in figure 1-18, which 
shows the voltage characteristics of the series-, shunt-, and compound-wound generators. As you can see, 
by proportioning the effects of the two fields (series and shunt), a compound-wound generator provides a 
constant output voltage under varying load conditions. Actual curves are seldom, if ever, as perfect as 
shown.
