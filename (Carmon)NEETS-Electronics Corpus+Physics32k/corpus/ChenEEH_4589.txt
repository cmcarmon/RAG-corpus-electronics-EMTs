If the nominal system model is accurate and precise enough
such that N ~yy(k þ 1), the remaining uncertainty of the nom-
g and the
inal system, is bounded by
online estimator is accurate enough such that the remaining
uncertainty of the failure dynamics, nf ~yy(k þ 1), is bounded
g, and
by the
DError(k), then the error after the searching effort of the
(i.e., bounded by
optimization algorithm is ﬁnite
{jDError(k)j}). In addition, the system stability after
sup
"k>Tf
time-step Tf under arbitrary unanticipated system failures
is guaranteed in an online situation, and the sliding surface
function, S, deﬁned by the system performance error is also
bounded as follows:
