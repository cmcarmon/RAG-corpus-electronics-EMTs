This technique's primary application is towards determining the crystallization age of minerals or rocks enriched in potassium and depleted in calcium. Due to the long half life of 40K (~1.25 billion years), K-Ca dating is most useful on samples older than 100,000 years. Given that the chosen sample has a relatively high current K/Ca ratio, and that the initial concentration of 40Ca can be determined, any error in this initial 40Ca concentration can be considered negligible when determining the sample's age.
K-Ca dating is not a common radioactive dating method for metamorphic rocks. However, this system is considered more stable than both the K-Ar and Rb-Sr dating methods. This fact, combined with advances in precision of Ca mass spectrometry, makes K-Ca dating a viable option for igneous and metamorphic rocks containing little to no zircon.
Potassium-calcium dating is especially useful for diagenetic minerals and marine sediments, which are both assumed to have had the same initial calcium isotopic composition as Earth's seawater at the time of their formation. As such, being able to assume the initial 40Ca/42Ca ratio as a constant, this dating method proves particularly fruitful for these respective samples.
