The  second  major  factor  that  affects  the  coverage  area  of  a  TV  station  is  antenna  height,  known  in  the
broadcast industry as height above average terrain (HAAT). HAAT takes into consideration the effects of the
geography in the vicinity of the transmitting tower. The maximum HAAT permitted by the FCC for a low- or
high-band VHF station is 1000 ft (305 m) east of the Mississippi River and 2000 ft (610 m) west of the Missis-
sippi. UHF stations are permitted to operate with a maximum HAAT of 2000 ft (610 m) anywhere in the United
States (including Alaska and Hawaii).
