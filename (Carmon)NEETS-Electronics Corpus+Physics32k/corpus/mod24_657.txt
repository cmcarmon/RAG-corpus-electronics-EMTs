ELEDs emit light in a narrow emission angle allowing for better source-to-fiber coupling. They
couple more power into small NA fibers than SLEDs. ELEDs can couple enough power into single mode
fibers for some applications. ELEDs emit power over a narrower spectral range than SLEDs. However,
ELEDs typically are more sensitive to temperature fluctuations than SLEDs.
