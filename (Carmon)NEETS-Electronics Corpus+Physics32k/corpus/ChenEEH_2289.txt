If the incident plane wave is beyond the critical angle, the
plane waves in the air region will be evanescent with an imagin-
ary vertical wave number kz. Each of the two plane waves in the
air region (upward and downward) that constitute a standing
wave ﬁeld do not, individually, have a time-average power ﬂow
in the z direction because kz is imaginary. There is an overall
power ﬂow in the z direction inside the air region, however,
because there is a transmitted ﬁeld in the lower region. The total
power ﬂow in the z direction is thus not the sum of the two
individual power ﬂows. The two waves in the air region are not
orthogonal, and the second orthogonal property does not apply
since the wave number kz is not real.
