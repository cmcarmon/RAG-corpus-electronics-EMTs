The stator has a laminated and slotted silicon steel iron core. The stacked core is clamped and held together
by  insulated  axial  through  bolts.  The  stator  winding  is  placed  in  the  slots  and  consists  of  a  copper-strand
conﬁguration with woven glass insulation between the strands and mica ﬂakes, mica mat, or mica paper ground-
wall  insulation.  To  avoid  insulation  damage  caused  by  vibration,  the  groundwall  insulation  is  reinforced  by
asphalt, epoxy-impregnated ﬁberglass, or Dacron. The largest machine stator is Y-connected and has two coils
per phase, connected in parallel. Most frequently, the stator is hydrogen-cooled; however, small units may be
air-cooled and very large units may be water-cooled.
