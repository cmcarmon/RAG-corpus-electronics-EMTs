The DCT is very effective in reducing the redundancy of real
images. It tends to concentrate energy in very few transform
coefﬁcients. In other words, the coefﬁcients with most of the
energy are in general the ones with low values of k in equation
4.38. Since, in this equation, k is proportional to the frequency
of the cosine function, usually one refers to them as low-
frequency coefﬁcients. To illustrate this, Figure 4.21 shows
the 256  256 DCT of the image LENA 256  256. Actually,
the logarithm of the absolute value of the coefﬁcients has been
plotted. Black corresponds to zero, and the whiter the pixel,
the higher its value.
