Using the orthogonality principle it can be shown that if the random variables u and x are Gaussian zero
mean, then the optimum nonlinear estimate of q equals the linear estimate. In other words if q^ (x) = E{q*x} is
the optimum nonlinear estimate of u and q^  = ax is the optimum linear estimate, then q^ (x) = E{q^ *x} = q^
= ax.
This is true since the random variables u and x have zero mean, E{u} = E{x} = 0, and thus the linear estimate q^
 also has zero mean, E{e} =
