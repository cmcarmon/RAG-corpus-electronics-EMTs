While signiﬁcant progress has been made in solving the
ultra-large systems of equations generated by frequency-
domain integral equations (Song and Chew 1998), the capabil-
ities of even the latest such technologies are exhausted by many
volumetrically complex structures of engineering interest. This
also holds true for frequency-domain ﬁnite element techniques
that generate sparse rather than dense matrices. Further, the
very difﬁcult incorporation of material and device nonlinea-
rities into frequency-domain solutions of Maxwell’s equations
poses a signiﬁcant problem as engineers seek to design ac-
tive electromagnetic/electronic and electromagnetic/quantum-
optical systems such as high-speed digital circuits, microwave
and millimeter-wave ampliﬁers, and lasers.
