The ”null detector” is a sensitive device capable of indicating the presence of very small
voltages. If an electromechanical meter movement is used as the null detector, it will have a
spring-centered needle that can deﬂect in either direction so as to be useful for indicating a
voltage of either polarity. As the purpose of a null detector is to accurately indicate a condition
of zero voltage, rather than to indicate any speciﬁc (nonzero) quantity as a normal voltmeter
would, the scale of the instrument used is irrelevant. Null detectors are typically designed to
be as sensitive as possible in order to more precisely indicate a ”null” or ”balance” (zero voltage)
condition.
