When measuring a dc voltage drop across a component in a circuit, you must connect the voltmeter
in parallel with the component. As you can see in figure 4-5, the positive (red) lead is connected to the
positive side of the resistor, and the negative (black) lead is connected to the negative side. A voltage
reading is obtained on the meter when current flows through the resistor.
