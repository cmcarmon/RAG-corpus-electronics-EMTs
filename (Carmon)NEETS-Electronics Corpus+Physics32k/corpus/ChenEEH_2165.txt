. Paramagnetic materials have a small positive wm so that
mr01 as shown in Table 1.3. Paramagnetism is a quan-
tum mechanical effect largely due to the spin magnetic
moment of the electron. While these permanent magnetic
moments are usually randomly oriented (so that M Â¼ 0),
they become partially aligned in an applied B. In this
latter state, the magnetization M is aligned with the
applied B, thus increasing the total B in the sample
(and, consequently, decreasing H).
