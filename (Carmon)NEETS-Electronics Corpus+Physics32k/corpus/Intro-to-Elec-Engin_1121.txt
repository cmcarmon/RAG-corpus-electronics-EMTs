Thus far the equivalent circuit representing the stator phenomenon is exactly like that of the
transformer primary. Because of the air gap, however, the value of the magnetizing reactance
tends to be relatively low compared to that of a transformer, and the leakage reactance is larger
in proportion to the magnetizing reactance than it is in transformers. To complete the equivalent
circuit, the effects of the rotor must be incorporated, which we do by referring the rotor quantities
to the stator.
