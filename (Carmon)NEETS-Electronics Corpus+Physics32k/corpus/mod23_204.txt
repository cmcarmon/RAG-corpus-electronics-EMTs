This network selects the desired operating tape speed. It takes the reference frequency from the 
precision frequency source and (depending on the desired operating tape speed) generates another 
specific reference signal that the comparison network uses to control the speed of the capstan. Table 4-1 is 
a list of the speed control reference signal frequencies for the various operating tape speeds.
