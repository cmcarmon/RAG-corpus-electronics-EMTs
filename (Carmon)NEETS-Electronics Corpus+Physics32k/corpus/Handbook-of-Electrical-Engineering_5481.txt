Constant Current Control. This is the usual mode of operation of the rectiﬁer. When the converter is operating
in constant current control mode, the ﬁring angle is adjusted to maintain dc current at the ordered value. If
the load current goes higher than the ordered current for any reason, control increases the ﬁring angle to reduce
dc voltage and the converter operation moves in the direction from B to C. At point C, the ﬁring angle reaches
90 degrees (neglecting overlap angle), the voltage changes polarity, and the converter becomes an inverter. From
C to D, the converter works as an inverter.
