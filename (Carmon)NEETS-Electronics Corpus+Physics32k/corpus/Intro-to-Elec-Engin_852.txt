The load-bus data (speciÔ¨Åcations), transmission line data, and source-bus data are given in
Tables 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3, respectively. The reader is encouraged to work out the details.
Looking at the load-bus data, the amount of reactive power that is needed to provide 100%
compensation is 120 MVAR. Let us then add a three-phase shunt capacitor bank with a nominal
voltage rating of 115 kV and a reactive power rating of 120 MVAR. The per-phase reactance of
the bank can be computed as X = V 2/Q = 1152/120 = 110.2 . The load-bus data with power
factor correction are given in Table 10.3.4.
