of the thermal approaches require 0.5–2.0 J/cm2 energy at the paper surface. The energy required is determined
by the contact duration (related to the nip compliance and roll speed), pressure, paper water content, and the
melt-ﬂow rheological characteristics of the toner. Flash fusing has only been used in mid-range to high-end
printers  because  expensive  power  supplies  and  capacitor  banks  are  needed.  A  xenon  ﬂash  lamp  is  typically
pulsed  for  a  few  milliseconds  to  provide  the  required  energy.  Thermal  efﬁciency  improves  with  very  short
pulses, but undesired toner degradation volatiles increase with the higher temperatures produced. Care must
be taken with radiant fusing to insure that excessive paper overheating does not occur if the paper is stopped
under the incandescent lamp.
