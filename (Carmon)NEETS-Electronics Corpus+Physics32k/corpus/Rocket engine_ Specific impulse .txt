The most important metric for the efficiency of a rocket engine is impulse per unit of propellant, this is called specific impulse (usually written




I

s
p




{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
). This is either measured as a speed (the effective exhaust velocity




v

e




{\displaystyle v_{e}}
in metres/second or ft/s) or as a time (seconds). An engine that gives a large specific impulse is normally highly desirable.
The specific impulse that can be achieved is primarily a function of the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the specific impulse), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can be achieved.
