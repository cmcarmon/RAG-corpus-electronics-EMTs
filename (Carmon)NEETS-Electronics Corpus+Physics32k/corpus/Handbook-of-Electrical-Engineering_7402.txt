The  voltage-controlled  transmitter  is  calibrated  for  temperature  subcarrier  frequency  change  from  78  to
(cid:176)
F.  Two  calibrated  thermocouples,  welded  next  to  one  another  on  a  piece  of  stainless  steel,  are  heated
640
simultaneously.  After  determining  by  wire  link  instrumentation  that  both  thermocouples  are  indicating  the
same temperature, the millivolt output of one is fed into the transmitter, and the output of the other is fed by
wire into a precision potentiometer. The subcarrier frequency change is determined as a function of temperature,
and the radio signal is recorded on the calibrated oscillograph, with a galvanometer determining its deï¬‚ection
as  a  function  of  temperature.  The  data  obtained  by  wire  link  and  radio  are  then  compared  to  establish  the
calibration. The effect of thermocouple lengths can also be investigated in the same test setup. The receivers
and discriminators are calibrated before these tests.
