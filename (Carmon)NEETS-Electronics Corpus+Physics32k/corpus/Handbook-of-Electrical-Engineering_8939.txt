There have been numerous improvements and new developments using a variety of technologies that include
 grid, resistive, and sonic. Of these,
magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, electrostatic or capacitive, scanned 
electromagnetic  tablets  dominate  the  digitizer  market,  and  sonic  is  of  interest  because  it  does  not  require  a
tablet, but most of the other technologies are essentially restricted to touch input devices covered later. As noted
previously, electromagnetic is the most popular technology for high-performance digitizer tablets. Operation
is  based  on  transformer  principles,  whereby  a  conductor  carrying  ac  creates  a  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld  around  it  that
induces  a  current  in  a  second  conductor.  The  digitizer  tablet  uses  the  amplitude  and  phase  of  the  induced
 pattern of conductors beneath its surface, in
current to determine digitizing data. The tablet contains an 
a manner similar to the Rand Tablet, but instead of counting pulses in a time period a circular conductor is
used as the pick-up element for the induced current. This coil is placed on the tablet surface, and its position
is determined by measuring the phase and amplitude of the current in the coil. Its center is interpolated by
 grid lines and demodulating the signal in the coil to determine the phase reversal
sweeping through the 
 coordinates may be
point, or by calculating this point using digitized data fed into a microprocessor. The 
resolved  to  better  than  0.025  mm  using  either  of  these  two  techniques.  Figure  89.5(a)  is  a  photograph  of  a
representative digitizer tablet.
