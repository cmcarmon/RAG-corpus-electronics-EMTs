One part per hundred is generally represented by the percent (%) symbol and denotes one part per 100 parts, one part in 102, and a value of 1 × 10−2. This is equivalent to about fifteen minutes out of one day.

One part per thousand should generally be spelled out in full and not as "ppt" (which is usually understood to represent "parts per trillion"). It may also be denoted by the millage (‰) symbol. Note however, that specific disciplines such as oceanography, as well as educational exercises, do use the "ppt" abbreviation. "One part per thousand" denotes one part per 1000 parts, one part in 103, and a value of 1 × 10−3. This is equivalent to about one and a half minutes out of one day.
One part per ten thousand is denoted by the permyriad (‱) symbol. In contrast, in finance, the basis point is a quantity with dimensions of (time−1) and is typically used to denote changes in or differences between percentage interest rates. For instance, a change in an interest rate from 5.15% per annum to 5.35% per annum could be denoted as a change of 20 basis points. Although rarely used in science (ppm is typically used instead), one permyriad has an unambiguous value of one part per 10000 parts, one part in 104, and a value of 1 × 10−4. This is equivalent to about nine seconds out of one day.

One part per million (ppm) denotes one part per 1000000 parts, one part in 106, 1/1000000 × 100% = 0.0001% (or 1% = 10000 ppm), and a value of 1 × 10−6. This is equivalent to about 32 seconds out of a year; in distance measurement, it is equivalent to 1 mm of error per km of distance traversed.

One part per billion (ppb) denotes one part per 1000000000 parts, one part in 109, 1/1000000000 × 100% = 0.0000001% (or 1% = 10000000 ppb) and a value of 1 × 10−9. This is equivalent to about three seconds out of a century.

One part per trillion (ppt) denotes one part per 1000000000000 parts, one part in 1012, and a value of 1 × 10−12. This is equivalent to about three seconds out of every hundred thousand years.

One part per quadrillion (ppq) denotes one part per 1000000000000000 parts, one part in 1015, and a value of 1 × 10−15. This is equivalent to about two and a half minutes out of the age of the Earth (4.5 billion years). Although relatively uncommon in analytical chemistry, measurements at the ppq level are sometimes performed.
