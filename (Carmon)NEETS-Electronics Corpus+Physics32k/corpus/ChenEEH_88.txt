The number of edges incident on a vertex vi is called the
degree of vi and is denoted by d(vi). In a directed graph, din(vi)
refers to the number of edges incident into the vertex vi, and it
is called the in-degree. In a directed graph, dout (vi) refers to the
number of edges incident out of the vertex vi or the out-
degree. If d(vi) ¼ 0, then vi is said to be an isolated vertex.
If d(vi) ¼ 1, then vi is said to be a pendant vertex.
