Oscillators may be classified by name, such as Armstrong, Hartley, Colpitts, or by the manner in 
which dc power is applied. An oscillator in which dc power is supplied to the transistor through the tank 
circuit, or a portion of the tank circuit, is said to be SERIES FED. An oscillator which receives its dc 
power for the transistor through a path separate and parallel to the tank circuit is said to be PARALLEL 
FED OR SHUNT FED. All the oscillators in this chapter can be constructed either way, series or shunt 
fed. The construction depends on the characteristics of the oscillator circuit the designer is interested in.
