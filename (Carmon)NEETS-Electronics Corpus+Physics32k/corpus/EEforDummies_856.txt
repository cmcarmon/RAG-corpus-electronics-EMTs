You can use a more efficient method of controlling the speed of the motor 
called pulse‐width modulation. This method turns voltage on and off in quick 
pulses. The longer the on intervals, the faster the motor goes. If you’re build-
ing a kit for something motor controlled (such as a robot), this type of speed 
control should be included with the electronics for the kit.
