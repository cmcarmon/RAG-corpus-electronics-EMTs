Born  into  a  noble  family  in  Como,  Italy,  Volta  was  performing
electrical  experiments  at  age  18.  His  invention  of  the  battery  in  1796
revolutionized  the  use  of  electricity.  The  publication  of  his  work  in
1800  marked  the  beginning  of  electric  circuit  theory.  Volta  received
many  honors  during  his  lifetime. The  unit  of  voltage  or  potential  dif-
ference, the volt, was named in his honor.
