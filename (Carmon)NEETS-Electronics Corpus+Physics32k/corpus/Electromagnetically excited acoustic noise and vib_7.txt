The simulation of electromagnetically-excited noise and vibrations is a multiphysic modeling process carried in three steps:
calculation of the electromagnetic forces
calculation of the resulting magnetic vibrations
calculation of the resulting magnetic noise
It is generally considered as a weakly coupled problem: the deformation of the structure under electromagnetic forces is assumed not to change significantly the electromagnetic field distribution and the resulting electromagnetic stress.
