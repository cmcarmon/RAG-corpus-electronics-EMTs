Today, an integrated	circuit	(Ic) is a complete 
electronic circuit in a package no larger than that of 
a conventional low-power transistor. The circuit con-
sists of diodes, transistors, resistors, and capacitors. 
Integrated circuits are produced with the same tech-
nology and materials used in making transistors and 
other semiconductor devices.
