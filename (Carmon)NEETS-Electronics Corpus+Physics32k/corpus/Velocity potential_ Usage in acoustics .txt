In theoretical acoustics, it is often desirable to work with the acoustic wave equation of the velocity potential Φ instead of pressure p and/or particle velocity u.

Solving the wave equation for either p field or u field does not necessarily provide a simple answer for the other field. On the other hand, when Φ is solved for, not only is u found as given above, but p is also easily found – from the (linearised) Bernoulli equation for irrotational and unsteady flow – as
