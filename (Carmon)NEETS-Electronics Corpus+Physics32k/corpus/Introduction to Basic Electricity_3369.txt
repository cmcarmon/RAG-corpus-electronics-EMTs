Both junctions are equally doped, so a DIAC has 
the same effect on current regardless of the direction 
of flow. One of the junctions is forward biased and the 
other is reverse biased. The reverse-biased  junction 
controls the current flowing through the DIAC. The 
DIAC performs as if it contains two Pâ€“N junction 
 diodes connected in series back to back (Figure 33-16).  
The DIAC remains in the off state until an applied 
voltage in either direction is high enough to cause  
its reverse-biased junction to break over and start 
 conducting much like a zener diode. Break over is the 
point at which conduction starts to occur. This causes 
the DIAC to turn on and the current to rise to a value 
limited by a series resistor in the circuit.
