Frequently, the ampere is much too large a unit for measuring current. Therefore, the
MILLIAMPERE (mA), one-thousandth of an ampere, or the MICROAMPERE ( $���RQH�PLOOLRQWK�RI�DQ
ampere, is used. The device used to measure current is called an AMMETER and will be discussed in
detail in a later module.
