The initial heavy flow of current produces a large voltage across R1 which tapers off exponentially 
as C1 charges. The charge on C1 is determined by the time constant of R1 and the conducting resistance 
of the diode times the capacitance of C1. For ease of explanation, assume that C1 is charged to the peak 
value before T1.
