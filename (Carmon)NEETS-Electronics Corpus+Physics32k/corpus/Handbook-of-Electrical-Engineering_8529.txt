Multiprocessors
Physical  limits  on  electronic  speeds  prevent  single  processors  from  being  speeded  up  indeﬁnitely.  A  major
design trend has seen the development of systems that consist of a large number of processors. Such multipro-
cessors can be used to speed up the execution of large programs by executing subtasks in parallel. The main
difﬁculty in achieving this type of speedup is in being able to decompose a given task into its parallel subtasks
and assign these subtasks to the individual processors in such a way that communication among the subtasks
can be done efﬁciently. Fig. 86.10 shows a block diagram of a multiprocessor system, with the interconnection
network needed for data sharing among the processors Pi. Parallel paths are needed in this network in order
for  parallel  activity  to  proceed  in  the  processors  as  they  access  the  global  memory  space  represented  by  the
multiple memory units Mi.
