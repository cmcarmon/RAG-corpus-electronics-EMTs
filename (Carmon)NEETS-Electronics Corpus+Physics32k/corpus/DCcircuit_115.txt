Perhaps the best example of a polarized device is the diode. A diode is a one-way ”valve”
for electric current, analogous to a check valve for those familiar with plumbing and hydraulic
systems. Ideally, a diode provides unimpeded ﬂow for current in one direction (little or no
resistance), but prevents ﬂow in the other direction (inﬁnite resistance). Its schematic symbol
looks like this:
