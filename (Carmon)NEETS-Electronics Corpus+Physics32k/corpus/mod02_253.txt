A circuit having pure resistance (if such a thing were possible) would have the alternating current 
through it and the voltage across it rising and failing together. This is illustrated in figure 4-1(A), which 
shows the sine waves for current and voltage in a purely resistive circuit having an ac source. The current 
and voltage do not have the same amplitude, but they are in phase.
