Finally, Figure 4.4.5 illustrates how a device, such as a light, can be controlled independently
from two different locations using single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches, commonly known
as three-way switches or staircase switches. When the “hot” wire is switched between two
“travelers” at the ﬁrst switch and from the travelers to the device at the second, a complete
circuit is formed only when both switches are either up or down; ﬂipping either switch opens the
circuit. Note that neutral and ground wires are never switched.
