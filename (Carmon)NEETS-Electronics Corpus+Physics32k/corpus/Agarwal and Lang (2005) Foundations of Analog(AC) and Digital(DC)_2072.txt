For R = 50 , Q = 25. For this high value of Q, following the discussion of Q in
Section 14.5.2, we expect to see a peaky frequency response, as can be confirmed by
observing the magnitude plot of the frequency response of Hc in Figure 14.41a. The
plot in Figure 14.41a also shows that the peak value is 25.
