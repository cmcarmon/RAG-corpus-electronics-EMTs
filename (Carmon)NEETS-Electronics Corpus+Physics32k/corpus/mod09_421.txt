T1 can be shown as an inductor and R1-R2 as a combined or equivalent series resistance (RE) since 
T1 has an effective inductance and any change in R1 or R2 will change the current. The equivalent circuit 
is shown in figure 3-31, view (B). It acts as a series RL circuit and will be discussed in those terms.
