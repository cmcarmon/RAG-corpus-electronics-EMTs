The interaction between a series-capacitor-compensated ac transmission system in electrical resonance and
a turbine-generator mechanical system in torsional mechanical resonance results in the phenomenon of sub-
synchronous resonance (SSR). Energy is exchanged between the electrical and mechanical systems at one or
more natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system. The resulting
mechanical oscillations can increase until mechanical failure takes place.
