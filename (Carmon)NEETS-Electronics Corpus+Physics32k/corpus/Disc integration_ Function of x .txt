If the function to be revolved is a function of x, the following integral represents the volume of the solid of revolution:




π

∫

a


b


R
(
x

)

2



d
x


{\displaystyle \pi \int _{a}^{b}R(x)^{2}\,dx}

where R(x) is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the axis of rotation is horizontal (example: y = 3 or some other constant).
