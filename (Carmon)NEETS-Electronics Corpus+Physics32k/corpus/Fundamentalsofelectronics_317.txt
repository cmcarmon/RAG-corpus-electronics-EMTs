Problem 3.31: Solving a Mystery Circuit
Sammy must determine as much as he can about a mystery circuit by attaching elements to the terminal
and measuring the resulting voltage. When he attaches a 1Ω resistor to the circuit’s terminals, he measures
the voltage across the terminals to be 3 sin (t). When he attaches a 1F capacitor across the terminals, the
voltage is now 3
