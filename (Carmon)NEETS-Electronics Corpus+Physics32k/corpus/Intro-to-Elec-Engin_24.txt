14. Basic material introduced in this book is totally independent of any software that may
accompany the usage of this book, and/or the laboratory associated with the course. The common
software in usage, as of writing this book, consists of Windows, Word Perfect, PSPICE, Math
CAD, and MATLAB. There are also other popular specialized simulation programs such as Signal
Processing Workstation (SPW) in the area of analog and digital communications, Very High
Level Description Language (VHDL) in the area of digital systems, Electromagnetic Transients
Program (EMTP) in the ﬁeld of power, and SIMULINK in the ﬁeld of control. In practice,
however, any combination of software that satisﬁes the need for word processing, graphics, editing,
mathematical analysis, and analog as well as digital circuit analysis should be satisfactory.
