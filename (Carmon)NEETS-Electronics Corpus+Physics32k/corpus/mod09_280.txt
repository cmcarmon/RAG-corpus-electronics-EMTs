The waveforms in figure 2-12 illustrate the relationship between the collector voltage and collector 
current. Notice that collector current (IC) flows for only a short time during each cycle. While the tank 
circuit is oscillating (figure 2-11), L2 acts as the primary of the transformer and L1 acts as the secondary. 
The signal from the tank is, therefore, coupled through T1 to coupling capacitor C4, and the output 
voltage across L4 is a sine wave.
