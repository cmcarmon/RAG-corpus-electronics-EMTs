where v ¼ 2pf is the radian frequency. Let this signal be ap-
plied to the generator located at z ¼ 0. If the line is an air line,
the signal travels at a velocity vp ¼ 3  108 m=sec and reaches
the load at time t ¼ ‘=vp. Thus, the signal experiences a time
delay proportional to the distance that the wave has traveled
along the line. At the load, the signal waveform is given by:
