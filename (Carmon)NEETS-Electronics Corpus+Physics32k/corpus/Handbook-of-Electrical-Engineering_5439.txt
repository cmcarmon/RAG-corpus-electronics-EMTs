NEMA Publication “High Voltage Insulator Standard” and AIEE Standard 41 have been combined in ANSI
Standards  C29.1  through  C29.9.  Standard  C29.1  covers  all  electrical  and  mechanical  tests  for  all  types  of
insulators. The standards for the various insulators covering ﬂashover voltages (wet, dry, and impulse; radio
inﬂuence; leakage distance; standard dimensions; and mechanical-strength characteristics) are addressed. These
standards should be consulted when specifying or purchasing insulators.
