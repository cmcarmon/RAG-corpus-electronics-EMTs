The radiation-intensity pattern describing the power intensity in any spatial direction is
an important antenna characteristic, since the antenna does not radiate power equally in all
directions in space. Such patterns are three-dimensional in nature. One normally chooses spherical
coordinates centered on the antenna at A, and represents the power-intensity function P(θ, φ) at
any distant point R as a magnitude P from A, which appears as a surface with a large main lobe
and several side lobes (minor lobes), as shown in Figure 15.1.8.
