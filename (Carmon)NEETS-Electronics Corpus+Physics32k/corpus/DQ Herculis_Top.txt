DQ Herculis (or Nova Herculis 1934) was a slow, bright nova occurring in Hercules in December 1934. The nova was discovered on 13 December 1934 by J. P. M. Prentice from Stowmarket, Suffolk. It reached peak brightness on 22 December 1934 with an apparent magnitude of 1.5. The nova remained visible to the naked eye for several months.
DQ Herculis is the prototype for a category of cataclysmic variable stars called intermediate polars. The system shows orbital period variation, possibly due to the presence of a third body.
