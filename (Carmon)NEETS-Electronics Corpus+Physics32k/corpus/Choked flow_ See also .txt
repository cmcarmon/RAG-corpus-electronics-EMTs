Accidental release source terms includes mass flow rate equations for non-choked gas flows as well.
Orifice plate includes derivation of non-choked gas flow equation.
de Laval nozzles are Venturi tubes that produce supersonic gas velocities as the tube and the gas are first constricted and then the tube and gas are expanded beyond the choke plane.
Rocket engine nozzles discusses how to calculate the exit velocity from nozzles used in rocket engines.
