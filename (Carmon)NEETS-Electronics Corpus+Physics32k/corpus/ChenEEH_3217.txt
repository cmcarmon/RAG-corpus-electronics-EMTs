The advantages of the main-and-transfer scheme include
(a) its low initial and ultimate cost, (b) breakers that can be
taken out of service for maintenance, and (c) potential devices
that may be used on the main bus for relaying. Disadvantages
include (a) its requirement of one extra breaker for the tie bus,
(b) switching that is somewhat complicated when maintaining
a breaker and (c) the failure of bus or any circuit breaker
resulting in the shutdown of the entire substation.
