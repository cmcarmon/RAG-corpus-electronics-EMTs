De Broglie proposed that the frequency f of a matter wave equals E/h, where E is the total energy of the particle and h is Planck's constant. For a particle at rest, the relativistic equation E=mc2 allows the derivation of the Compton frequency f for a stationary massive particle, equal to mc2/h.
De Broglie also proposed that the wavelength Î» for a moving particle was equal to h/p where p is the particle's momentum.
The period (one cycle of the wave) is equal to 1/f.
This precise Compton periodicity of a matter wave is said to be the necessary condition for a clock, with the implication that any such matter particle may be regarded as a fundamental clock. This proposal has been referred to as "A rock is a clock."
