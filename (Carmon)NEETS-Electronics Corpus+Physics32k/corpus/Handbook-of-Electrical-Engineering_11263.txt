More  recently  the  high-resolution  ECG (HRECG)  as  been  developed  whereby  the  digitized  ECG  is  signal
averaged to reduce random noise (Berbari et al., 1973, 1977). This approach, coupled with post averaging high-
pass ﬁltering, is used to detect and quantify low-level signals (»1.0 mV) not detectable with standard approaches.
This computer-based approach has enabled the recording of events which are predictive of future life-threat-
ening cardiac events [Berbari et al., 1978; Simson, 1981].
