Much as the rays landing on the orbit divide up the circle, they divide up the complex plane. For every point




z

j




{\displaystyle z_{j}}
of the orbit, the external rays landing at




z

j




{\displaystyle z_{j}}
divide the plane into



v


{\displaystyle v}
open sets called sectors based at




z

j




{\displaystyle z_{j}}
. Sectors are naturally identified the complementary arcs based at the same point. The angular width of a sector is defined as the length of its corresponding complementary arc. Sectors are called critical sectors or critical value sectors when the corresponding arcs are, respectively, critical arcs and critical value arcs.
Sectors also have the interesting property that



0


{\displaystyle 0}
is in the critical sector of every point, and



c


{\displaystyle c}
, the critical value of




f

c




{\displaystyle f_{c}}
, is in the critical value sector.
