View (A) of figure 4-23 illustrates the circuit of a negative clamper with positive bias. With no input 
signal the capacitor charges to the battery voltage and the output is positive because the negative side of 
the battery is grounded. The output is illustrated in the bottom half of view (B). Study the figure carefully 
and note the following important points. The peak-to-peak amplitude and shape of the output waveform, 
for all practical purposes, are the same as that of the input. The output wave is clamped to +10 volts, the 
value of the battery. Since this is a negative clamper (cathode to ground), the top of the output wave 
touches the +10 volt reference line.
