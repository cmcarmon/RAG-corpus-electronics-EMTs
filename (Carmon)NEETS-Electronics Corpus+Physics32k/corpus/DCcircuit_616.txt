Now, we need to ﬁgure out what happens to the total resistance. This part is easy: when
we’re dealing with only one component change in the circuit, the change in total resistance
will be in the same direction as the change of the failed component. This is not to say that the
magnitude of change between individual component and total circuit will be the same, merely
the direction of change. In other words, if any single resistor decreases in value, then the total
circuit resistance must also decrease, and vice versa. In this case, since R2 is the only failed
component, and its resistance has decreased, the total resistance must decrease:
