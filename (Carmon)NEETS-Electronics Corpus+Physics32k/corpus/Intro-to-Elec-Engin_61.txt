Sources and Loads
A sourceâ€“load combination is represented in Figure 1.1.4. A node is a point at which two or
more components or devices are connected together. A part of a circuit containing only one
component, source, or device between two nodes is known as a branch. A voltage rise indicates
an electric source, with the charge being raised to a higher potential, whereas a voltage drop
indicates a load, with a charge going to a lower potential. The voltage across the source is the
same as the voltage across the load in Figure 1.1.4. The current delivered by the source goes
through the load. Ideally, with no losses, the power (p = vi) delivered by the source is consumed
by the load.
