The time domain information is converted by signal or harmonic analyzers into the frequency domain; the
instrumentation is also programmed to derive any required power quality indexes, such as THD (total harmonic
distortion), EDV (equivalent distortion voltage), EDI (equivalent distortion current), etc.
