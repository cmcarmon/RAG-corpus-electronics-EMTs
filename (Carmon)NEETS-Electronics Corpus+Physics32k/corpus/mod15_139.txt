The stator windings of the CT are considered to be the primary windings, and the rotor windings the 
secondary windings. The output, which is taken off the R1 and R2 rotor leads, is the voltage induced in 
the rotor windings. The phase and amplitude of the output voltage depend on the angular position of the 
rotor with respect to the magnetic field of the stator.
