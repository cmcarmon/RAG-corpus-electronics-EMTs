problem is to introduce buffers when driving long wires, as illustrated in Figure 10.102.
Assume that the buffer is constructed as depicted in Figure 10.94c using a pair of invert-
ers identical to the inverters in this problem. In other words, the input of a buffer
has a capacitance CGS to ground, and the output of a buffer have the same drive
characteristics as an inverter output. For this problem, you will ignore the internal
delay of the buffer. (See Problem 10.2c and f for a definition of the internal buffer
delay.) In other words, assume that a buffer driving zero output capacitance has zero
delay.
