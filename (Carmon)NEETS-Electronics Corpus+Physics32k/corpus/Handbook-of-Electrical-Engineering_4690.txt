Because  of  the  ability  to  control  the  amplitude  and  phase  of  the  individual  electrodes  or  taps,  it  is  easy  to
implement coding in a SAW ﬁlter. Figure 47.12 shows an example of a coded SAW ﬁlter implementation. By
changing the phase of the taps, it is possible to generate an arbitrary code sequence. These types of ﬁlters are
used in secure communication systems, spread spectrum communications, and tagging, to name a few [Mat-
thews, 1977].
