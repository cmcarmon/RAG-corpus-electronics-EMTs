. Timing jitter: If there is a slight jitter in the position of
the sample, the sampling is no longer uniform. The effect
of the jitter is equivalent to frequency modulation (FM)
of the baseband signal. If the jitter is random, a low-level
wideband spectral contribution is induced whose proper-
ties are very close to those of the quantizing noise. Timing
jitter can be controlled with very good power supply
isolation and stable clock reference.
