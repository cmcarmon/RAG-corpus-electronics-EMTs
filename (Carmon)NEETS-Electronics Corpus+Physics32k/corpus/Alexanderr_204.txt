where 
are constants. Each term on the right-hand
side of Eq. (4.13) is the contribution of the related independent source;
is the contribution to v due to the external current source i,
that is, 
A1vs1
and so on. We
may collect terms for the internal independent sources together as 
B0,
so that Eq. (4.13) becomes
