The Iribarren number – often denoted as Ir or ξ – is defined as:

{\displaystyle L_{0}={\frac {g}{2\pi }}\,T^{2},}

where ξ is the Iribarren number, α is the bed slope angle, H is the wave height, L0 is the deep-water wavelength, T is the period and g is the gravitational acceleration. Depending on the application, different definitions of H and T are used, for example: for periodic waves the wave height H0 at deep water or the breaking wave height Hb at the edge of the surf zone. Or, for random waves, the significant wave height Hs at a certain location.
