We will find the i v relationship of the device by applying some form of excitation to the
device terminals and obtaining the relationship between the values of i and v. One of the
simplest inputs we can apply is a current source providing a current itest, as illustrated
in Figure 2.61b. The figure also shows the assignment of branch variables.
