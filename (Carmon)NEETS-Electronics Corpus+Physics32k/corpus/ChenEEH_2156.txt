One of the most fundamental principles in magnetostatics is
that a current immersed in a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force.
This magnetic force behaves very differently than the electro-
static force. Considering two closed loops of current shown in
Figure 1.2, the total net magnetic force on the current in loop
1 due to the current in loop 2 is given by Ampe`re’s force law
(Paul et al., 1998):
