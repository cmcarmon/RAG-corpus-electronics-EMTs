shows the same amplifier circuit supplied with an input DC bias voltage VI
and a small signal input vi. The bias voltage VI might be provided by a resistor
divider circuit as in Figure 13.38c. Unlike the DC bias, the small signal input vi is
commonly a time-varying voltage, for example a sine wave. Correspondingly,
the output voltage vO is the sum of a DC output bias VO and a small-signal
voltage vo.
