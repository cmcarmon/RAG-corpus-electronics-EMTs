DIODE MEASUREMENTS.â€”Diode qualitative in-circuit measurements are attained by
connecting the green test lead to the cathode and the yellow test lead to the anode. Set the FUNCTION
switch to DIODE IN/CKT and the RANGE switch to X1. (Ensure that the meter has been properly zeroed
on this scale.) If the meter reads down scale, reverse the POLARITY switch. If the meter reads less than
midscale, the diode under test is either open or shorted. The related circuit impedance of this test is less
than 25 ohms.
