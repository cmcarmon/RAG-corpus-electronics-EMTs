Although there is great variety between different balsa wood bridge projects, students are in general trying to build a bridge that can withstand the greatest weight before it fails. Other restrictions are often applied, but these vary widely from one contest to another. Sample requirements include:
restricting the maximum mass of the bridge
requiring a minimum span
requiring a minimum height of the roadway
restricting the physical dimensions of the bridge
restricting the size of individual pieces of balsa wood
limiting the amount of glue or balsa wood that can be used
requiring a driveable roadway that allows passage of a vehicle of specified size
restricting the way pieces are placed on the bridge (for example no parallel joining pieces)
