So what symbol should really be used for ground points that are not truly 
connected to the earth? It’s the symbol labeled chassis ground. Common 
ground is sometimes called chassis ground because in older equipment, 
the metal chassis of the device (hi‐fi, television, or whatever) served as the 
common ground connection. Using a metal chassis for a ground connection 
is not as common today, but the term is still often used.
