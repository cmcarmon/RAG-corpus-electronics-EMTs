with P the sound pressure in decibels and F the sound pressure
in rms dynes. IEEE C57.12.90, Test Code for Liquid-Immersed
Transformers, speciﬁes the method for measuring the average
sound level of a transformer. The goal is to avoid a transformer
design and installation that produces noise at a level that is an
annoyance. Sound reduction can be accomplished at the trans-
former design stage and/or by judicious application. During
design, the most basic modiﬁcation effecting noise production
is to reduce the core’s ﬂux density. In addition, barriers or
structural changes in the tank enclosure will reduce emitted
noise. Upon installation, the erection of sound barriers is very
effective in reducing noise levels. With proper design, reduc-
tions of 10 to 30 dB are possible; with the application of sound
barriers at a site, an additional 10-dB reduction is achievable.
