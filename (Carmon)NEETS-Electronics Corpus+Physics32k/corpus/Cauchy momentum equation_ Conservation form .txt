Cauchy equations can also be put in the following form:

simply by defining:










j





=
ρ

u







F





=
ρ

u

⊗

u

−

σ







s





=
ρ

g







{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mathbf {j} }&=\rho \mathbf {u} \\{\mathbf {F} }&=\rho \mathbf {u} \otimes \mathbf {u} -{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}\\{\mathbf {s} }&=\rho \mathbf {g} \end{aligned}}}

where j is the momentum density at the point considered in the continuum (for which the continuity equation holds), F is the flux associated to the momentum density, and s contains all of the body forces per unit volume. u ⊗ u is the dyad of the velocity.
Here j and s have same number of dimensions N as the flow speed and the body acceleration, while F, being a tensor, has N2.
In the Eulerian forms it is apparent that the assumption of no deviatoric stress brings Cauchy equations to the Euler equations.
