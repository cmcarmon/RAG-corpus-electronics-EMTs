▶✓ Take  care  when  enclosing  your  project. 
Use a metal enclosure only if the enclosure 
is fully grounded. You need to use a three‐
prong electrical plug and wire for this. Be 
sure to firmly attach the green wire (which 
is always connected to earth ground) to the 
metal of the enclosure. If you can’t guar-
antee  a  fully  grounded  metal  enclosure, 
use a plastic enclosure. The plastic helps 
insulate you from any loose wires or acci-
dental electrocution. For projects that aren’t 
fully grounded, use only an isolated power 
supply, such as a wall transformer.
