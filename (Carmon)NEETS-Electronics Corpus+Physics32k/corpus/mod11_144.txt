The magnetron is classed as a diode because it has no grid. A magnetic field located in the space 
between the plate (anode) and the cathode serves as a grid. The plate of a magnetron does not have the 
same physical appearance as the plate of an ordinary electron tube. Since conventional inductive-
capacitive (LC) networks become impractical at microwave frequencies, the plate is fabricated into a 
cylindrical copper block containing resonant cavities which serve as tuned circuits. The magnetron base 
differs considerably from the conventional tube base. The magnetron base is short in length and has large 
diameter leads that are carefully sealed into the tube and shielded.
