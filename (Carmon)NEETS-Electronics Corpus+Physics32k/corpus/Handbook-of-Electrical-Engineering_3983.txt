The most commonly used two-terminal active devices consist of Gunn, tunnel, and IMPATT diodes. These
devices can be designed to provide useful gain from low gigahertz frequencies to high millimeter-wave frequen-
cies. Three-terminal devices consist of bipolar (BJT), heterojunction bipolar (HBT), and Ô¨Åeld-effect transistors
(MESFETs and HEMTs). These devices can also be operated from UHF to millimeter-wave frequencies.
