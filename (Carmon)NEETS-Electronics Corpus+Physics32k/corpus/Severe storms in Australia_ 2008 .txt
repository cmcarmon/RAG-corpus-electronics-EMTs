On 16 November 2008, Brisbane was hit by a thunderstorm with wind gusts up to 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph) reaching speeds of Category 2 tropical cyclones, and flooding throughout the region. Areas were declared disaster zones, with one of the worst hit areas being The Gap, a north-western suburb, where roofs were lifted off houses, trees were uprooted, and cars were destroyed by falling debris, destruction typical of tropical cyclones. Recovery efforts were hampered as further storms continued throughout the week.
