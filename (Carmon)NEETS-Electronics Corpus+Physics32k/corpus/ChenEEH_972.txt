Step 1. The circuit timing and connectivity data are read in
and compressed and stored in a binary database. The
database can be used for fast data access in subsequent
algorithmic applications of the same circuit. Further-
more, the data size of the database permits signiﬁ-
cant space and time savings if the circuit data are
exchanged.
