ac Plasma Displays
Figure  83.23  shows  that  currently,  color  plasma  displays  are  dominated  by  the  ac  technology,  so  it  is  worth
examining the ac monochrome structure shown in Fig. 83.28 [Criscimagna and Pleshko, 1980]. These panels
are made by depositing thin ﬁlm electrodes on the front and back substrates and then covering those electrodes
with  a  thin  dielectric  glass.  Recall  from  Fig. 83.27  that  this  dielectric  glass  makes  a  capacitor  that  is  used  to
limit  the  discharge  current.  This  dielectric  also  is  used  to  store  the  charge  that  gives  these  panels  inherent
memory. The two substrates are then sealed together around the perimeter and ﬁlled with neon gas. The ac
panels have a very simple structure that allows the pixels to be isolated simply by the action of electric ﬁelds.
The  ac  plasma  panels  require  the  inner  surface  of  the  dielectric  that  is  in  contact  with  the  gas  to  have  a
special coating of magnesium oxide. This MgO layer is necessary for the panel to have low operating voltages
and long life. Being a refractory oxide, MgO sputters away at a very low rate and it is also well known for its
high secondary electron emission.
