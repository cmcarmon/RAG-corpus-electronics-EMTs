In these equations, the only source along the horizontal portion of the line is the horizontal component of
the incident electric ﬁeld. At the line terminations, the boundary condition and the termination current, I, are
used  to  determine  the  end  voltage. At  those  vertically  oriented  terminations,  the  vertical  electric  ﬁelds  drive
currents through the terminations into the line. The total voltage, Vt(x,t), at the line terminations must equal
IT*ZT at all times, where ZT is the termination impedance. Equations (40.17) through (40.19) can be represented
by the circuit model in Fig. 40.24.
