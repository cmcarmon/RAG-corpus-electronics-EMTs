Channel Coding Theorems
In  information  theory,  the  results  that  give  a  formula  for  channel  capacity  in  terms  of  the  probabilistic
description of the channel are known as channel coding theorems. They typically involve two parts: an achiev-
ability part, which shows that codes with vanishing error probability exist for any rate below capacity; and a
converse part, which shows that if the code rate exceeds capacity, then the probability of error is necessarily
bounded away from zero. Shannon gave the ﬁrst achievability results in [Shannon, 1948] for discrete memory
channels. His method of proof, later formalized as the method of “typical sequences” (e.g., [Cover and Thomas,
1991]), is based on showing that the average probability of error of a code chosen at random vanishes with
blocklength. Other known achievability proofs such as Feinstein’s [1954], Gallager’s [1968], and the method
of types [Csiszar and Korner, 1981] are similarly non-constructive. The discipline of coding theory deals with
constructive methods to design codes that approach the Shannon limit (see Chapter 71.1). The ﬁrst converse
channel coding theorem was not given by Shannon, but by Fano in 1952. A decade after Shannon’s pioneering
paper, several authors obtained the ﬁrst channel coding theorems for channels with memory [Dobrushin, 1963].
The most general formula for channel capacity known to date can be found in [Verdú and Han, 1994]. The
capacity  of  channels  with  feedback  was  ﬁrst  considered  by  Shannon  in  1961  [Shannon,  1961],  with  later
developments for Gaussian channels summarized in [Cover and Thomas, 1991]. In his 1961 paper [Shannon,
1961], Shannon founded the discipline of multiuser information theory by posing several challenging channels
with more than one transmitter and/or receiver. In contrast to the multiaccess channel (one receiver) which
has been solved in considerable generality, the capacities of channels involving more than one receiver, such as
broadcast channels [Cover, 1972] and interference channels remain unsolved except in special cases.
