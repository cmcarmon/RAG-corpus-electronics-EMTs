First, we need to become acquainted with the various quantities associated with mag-
netism. There are quite a few more quantities to be dealt with in magnetic systems than
for electrical systems. With electricity, the basic quantities are Voltage (E), Current (I), Re-
sistance (R), and Power (P). The ﬁrst three are related to one another by Ohm’s Law (E=IR ;
I=E/R ; R=E/I), while Power is related to voltage, current, and resistance by Joule’s Law (P=IE
; P=I2R ; P=E2/R).
