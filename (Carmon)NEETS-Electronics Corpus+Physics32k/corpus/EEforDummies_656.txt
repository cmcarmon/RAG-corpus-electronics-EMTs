of the transistor also passes through two 
resistors: the 10 kΩ resistor and the poten-
tiometer. You can measure the voltage drop 
across either resistor and divide the voltage 
reading by the resistance. (In Chapter 6, you 
find out that Ohm’s Law tells you that the 
current passing through a resistor is equal 
to the voltage across the resistor divided by 
the resistance.)
