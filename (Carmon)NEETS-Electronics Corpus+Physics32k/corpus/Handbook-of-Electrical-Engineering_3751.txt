This section summarizes the basic principles of electromagnetic (EM) 
in space. The principles
essentially state how the characteristics of the earth and the atmosphere affect the propagation of EM waves.
Understanding such principles is of practical interest to communication system engineers. Engineers cannot
competently apply formulas or models for communication system design without an adequate knowledge of
the propagation issue.
