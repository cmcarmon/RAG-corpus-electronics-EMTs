works as a phase modulator for high-frequency components, a better overall system performance
results compared to each system (FM or PM) alone. This is the idea behind preemphasis and
deemphasis ﬁltering techniques.
Figure 14.3.9(a) shows a typical noise power spectrum at the output of the demodulator in the
frequency interval|f| < W for PM, whereas Figure 14.3.9(b) shows that for FM. The preemphasis
and deemphasis ﬁlter characteristics (i.e., frequency responses) are shown in Figure 14.3.10.
