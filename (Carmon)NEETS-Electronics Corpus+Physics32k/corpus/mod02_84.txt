 Another way of increasing the inductance is to wind the coil in layers. Figure 2-9 shows three cores 
with different amounts of layering. The coil in figure 2-9(A) is a poor inductor compared to the others in 
the figure because its turns are widely spaced and there is no layering. The flux movement, indicated by 
the dashed arrows, does not link effectively because there is only one layer of turns. A more inductive coil 
is shown in figure 2-9(B). The turns are closely spaced and the wire has been wound in two layers. The 
two layers link each other with a greater number of flux loops during all flux movements. Note that nearly 
all the turns, such as X, are next to four other turns (shaded). This causes the flux linkage to be increased.
