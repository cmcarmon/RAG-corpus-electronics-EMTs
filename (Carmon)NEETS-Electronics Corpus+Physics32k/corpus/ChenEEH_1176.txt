Mutual inductance noise occurs when signal switching causes
transient current to ﬂow through the loop formed by the signal
wire and current return path (Intel, 2001), thereby creating a
changing magnetic ﬁeld (see Figure 7.6). This induces a voltage
on a quiet line, which is in or near this loop. These noise
sources can be cumulative if there are several signals switching
simultaneously in a bus. Mutual inductance is a long-range
phenomenon and hence is worse in the presence of wide
