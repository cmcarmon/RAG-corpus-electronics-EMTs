The basic problem of a vacuum energy producing a gravitational effect was identified as early as 1916 by Walther Nernst. The value was predicted to be either zero or very small, so that the theoretical problem was already apparent, and began to be actively discussed in the 1970s.
With the development of inflationary cosmology in the 1980s, the problem became much more important: as cosmic inflation is driven by vacuum energy, differences in modeling vacuum energy leads to huge differences in the resulting cosmologies.
