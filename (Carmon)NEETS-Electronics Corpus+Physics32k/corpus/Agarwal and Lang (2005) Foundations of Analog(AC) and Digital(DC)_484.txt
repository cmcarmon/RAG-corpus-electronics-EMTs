The superposition theorem thus states that in a linear network with a num-
ber of independent sources, the response can be found by summing the responses
to each independent source acting alone, with all other independent sources set to
zero. These individual responses can be found very readily by forming subcircuits
in which all independent sources except one are set to zero.
