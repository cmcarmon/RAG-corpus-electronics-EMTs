We note first that s must equal s1, otherwise Equation 13.13 cannot be satisfied
for all time. Now, on the basis that e st can never be zero for finite values of
t, the e s1t terms can be divided out, to yield an algebraic equation relating the
complex amplitudes of the voltages rather than a differential equation relating
the voltages as time functions:
