The model proposed by Hillerborg in 1976, was the first model to analyse concrete fracture making use of the fracture energy concept. In this model, Hillerborg describes two crack regions namely,
True or physical crack
Fictitious crack or fracture process zone (FPZ)
True crack region
is the outer most part where cracking process is completed and no stresses can be propagated through this zone. COD is comparatively high and more or less constant.
In this region we have both stress discontinuity and displacement discontinuity.
Fracture process zone
situated just interior to the True crack region where crack is initiating and propagating.
In this zone at crack tip, we have peak stress = tensile strength of concrete.
Along the FPZ stress is continuous and displacement is discontinuous.
Crack propagation in FPZ starts when critical stress is equal to tensile strength of concrete and as crack starts propagating, stress does not become zero. Using the plot of fracture energy versus crack width, we can calculate critical stress at any point including crack tip. So one of the major drawbacks of LEFM is overcome using fracture energy approach. Direction of crack propagation can also be determined by identifying the direction of maximum energy release rate.
Concept of characteristic length
Hillerborg defined a parameter called Hillerborg characteristic length(



l


{\displaystyle l}
) which is numerically expressed as,




l
=



E
G


σ

2






{\displaystyle l={\frac {EG}{\sigma ^{2}}}}


where




l


{\displaystyle l}
= characteristic length




E


{\displaystyle E}
= Young's Modulus




G


{\displaystyle G}
= fracture energy




σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
= critical stress value

Hillerborg characteristic length can be used to predict brittleness of a material. As magnitude of characteristic length decreases brittle nature dominates and vice versa.
