Let's take a look at figure 3-6 to see all the operating controls and indicators located on the front 
panel. Some controls are used only for initial setup and are protected by a hinged access cover. All 
connections are made at the rear of the case. The amplifiers and the associated interstage broadband 
transformer assemblies are cooled by forced ventilation. Cooling air is drawn through a filter on the front 
panel and exhausted through a port on the rear of the case. You should always take particular care to clean 
or replace any filter in electronic equipment as a regular part of your preventive maintenance program.
