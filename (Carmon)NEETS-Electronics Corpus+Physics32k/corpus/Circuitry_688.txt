Checking distortion 
 
Oscilloscopes  are  frequently  used  to  investigate 
distortion 
in  amplifiers  and  other  electronic 
systems.  Different  forms  of  distortion  have  a 
different  effect  on  a  waveform  and  thus  it  is 
possible  to  determine  which  type  of  distortion  is 
present.  A  ‘pure’  sine  wave  is  used  as  an  input 
signal  and  the  output  is  then  displayed  on  the 
oscilloscope.  Figure  14.31  shows  waveforms  that 
correspond 
forms  of 
distortion.
