This problem examines the power dissipated by a small digital
logic circuit. The circuit comprises a series-connected inverter and NOR gate as shown
in Figure 11.29. The circuit has two inputs, A and B, and one output, Z. The inputs are
assumed to be periodic with period T4 as shown in Figure 11.29. Assume that RON for
each MOSFET is zero.
