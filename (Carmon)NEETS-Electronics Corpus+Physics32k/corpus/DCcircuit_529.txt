This way, the schematic may be used as a ”map” to locate points in a real circuit, regardless
of how tangled and complex the connecting wiring may appear to the eyes. This may seem ex-
cessive for the simple, three-resistor circuit shown here, but such detail is absolutely necessary
for construction and maintenance of large circuits, especially when those circuits may span a
great physical distance, using more than one terminal strip located in more than one panel or
box.
