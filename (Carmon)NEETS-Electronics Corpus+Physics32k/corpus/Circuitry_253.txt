Bipolar transistor characteristics 
 
The  characteristics  of  a 
transistor  are  often 
presented  in  the  form  of  a  set  of  graphs  relating 
voltage  and  current  present  at  the  transistorâ€™s 
terminals.  
  A typical input characteristic (IB plotted against 
VBE)
for  a  small-signal  general-purpose  NPN 
transistor  operating  in  common-emitter  mode  (see 
Chapter 7) is shown in Fig. 5.21. This characteristic 
shows  that  very  little  base  current  flows  until  the
