rotor carries a ﬁeld winding excited by the dc supply through brushes and slip rings. When the
rotor is driven at a constant speed, voltages of equal amplitude but different phase angle will be
generated in the three phases in accordance with Faraday’s law. Each of the three stator coils
constitutes one phase of this single generator. If the ﬁeld structure is so designed that the ﬂux is
distributed sinusoidally over the poles, the ﬂux linking any phase will vary sinusoidally with time,
and sinusoidal voltages will be induced in the three phases. These three induced voltage waves
will be displaced by 120 electrical degrees in time because the stator phases are displaced by 120°
in space. When the rotor is driven counterclockwise, Figure 4.1.2(a) shows the wave forms and
Figure 4.1.2(b) depicts the corresponding phasors of the three voltages. The time origin and the
reference axis are chosen on the basis of analytical convenience. In a balanced system, all three
phase voltages are equal in magnitude but differ from each other in phase by 120°. The sequence
of voltages in Figure 4.1.2(b), corresponding to that of Figure 4.1.2(a), is known as the positive
sequence (a–b–c). On the other hand, if the rotor is driven clockwise, then Figure 4.1.2(c) shows
the corresponding phasor of the three voltages; the sequence of voltages in Figure 4.1.2(c) is
