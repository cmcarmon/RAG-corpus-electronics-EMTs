Composite Video
The composite video waveform is shown in Fig. 69.17. The actual radiated signal is inverted, with modulation
extending from the synchronizing pulses at maximum carrier level (100%) to reference picture white at 7.5%.
Because an increase in the amplitude of the radiated signal corresponds to a decrease in picture brightness, the
polarity of modulation is termed negative. The term composite is used to denote a video signal that contains:
