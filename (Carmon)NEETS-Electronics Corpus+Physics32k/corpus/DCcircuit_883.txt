tion would be greater than each right junction, resulting in a total output voltage equal to the
sum of all junction pair differentials. In a thermopile, this is exactly how things are set up.
A source of heat (combustion, strong radioactive substance, solar heat, etc.) is applied to one
set of junctions, while the other set is bonded to a heat sink of some sort (air- or water-cooled).
Interestingly enough, as electrons ï¬‚ow through an external load circuit connected to the ther-
mopile, heat energy is transferred from the hot junctions to the cold junctions, demonstrating
another thermo-electric phenomenon: the so-called Peltier Effect (electric current transferring
heat energy).
