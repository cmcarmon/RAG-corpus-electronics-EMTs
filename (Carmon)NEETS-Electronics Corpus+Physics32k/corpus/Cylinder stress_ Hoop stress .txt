The hoop stress is the force exerted circumferentially (perpendicular both to the axis and to the radius of the object) in both directions on every particle in the cylinder wall. It can be described as:





σ

θ


=



F

t
l







{\displaystyle \sigma _{\theta }={\dfrac {F}{tl}}\ }

where:
F is the force exerted circumferentially on an area of the cylinder wall that has the following two lengths as sides:
t is the radial thickness of the cylinder
l is the axial length of the cylinder
An alternative to hoop stress in describing circumferential stress is wall stress or wall tension (T), which usually is defined as the total circumferential force exerted along the entire radial thickness:




T
=



F
l






{\displaystyle T={\dfrac {F}{l}}\ }


Along with axial stress and radial stress, circumferential stress is a component of the stress tensor in cylindrical coordinates.
It is usually useful to decompose any force applied to an object with rotational symmetry into components parallel to the cylindrical coordinates r, z, and θ. These components of force induce corresponding stresses: radial stress, axial stress and hoop stress, respectively.
