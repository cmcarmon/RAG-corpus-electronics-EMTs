c i r c u i t Consider the circuit shown in Figure 7.6. Let vI be the voltage sourced
by an independent voltage source. The current iO = f (x) produced by the dependent
current source is a function of other values in the circuit. Let us first analyze the circuit
when the output of the current source depends on a voltage:
