The Ackerberg-Mossberg Biquad. The Ackerberg-Mossberg
biquad is a direct implementation of the two-integrator loop
in Figure 4.3 with the two integrators of Figure 4.2. Adding
further a summer that combines all ampliﬁer output voltages
weighted by different coefﬁcients, we obtain the circuit in
Figure 4.6. Using routine analysis,2 we can derive the transfer
function of the circuit as:
