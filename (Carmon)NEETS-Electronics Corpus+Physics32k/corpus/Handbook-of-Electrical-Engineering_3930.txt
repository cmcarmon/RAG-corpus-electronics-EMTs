The direct-contacting coax probe and inset microstrip line feeds have the advantage of simplicity, but suffer
from some disadvantages. First, bandwidth is limited because of the requirement of a thin substrate, as discussed
above. In addition, the inherent E-plane asymmetry of these feeds generates higher-order modes which lead
