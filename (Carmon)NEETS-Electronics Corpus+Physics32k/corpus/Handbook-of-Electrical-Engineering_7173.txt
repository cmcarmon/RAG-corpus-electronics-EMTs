Satellites continue to exploit their unique wide view of the earth for such applications as broadcast, mobile,
and personal communications, and will ﬁnd new niches for end-to-end broadband communications between
customer premises by using the Ka-bands at 20 and 30 GHz and, perhaps, even higher frequencies. Historically,
satellite construction has resembled a craft industry with extensive custom design, long lead times, long test
programs, and high cost. New trends, pioneered by the lean production and design-to-cost concepts for the
Iridium  and  Globalstar  programs  are  leading  to  systems  having  lower  cost  per  unit  of  capacity  and  higher
reliability. Technology advances that are being pursued include development of light-weight small satellites for
economical provision of data and communications services at low cost, more sophisticated on-board processing
to  improve  interconnectivity,  microwave  and  optical  inter-satellite  links,  and  improved  components  such  as
batteries and antennas with dynamically reconﬁgurable beams such as may be implemented by digital beam
forming techniques [Bjornstrom, 1993].
