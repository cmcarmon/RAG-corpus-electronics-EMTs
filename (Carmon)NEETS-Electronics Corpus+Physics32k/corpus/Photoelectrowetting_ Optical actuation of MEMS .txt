Photo-actuation of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has been demonstrated using photoelectrowetting., A microcantilever is placed on top of the liquid-insulator-photoconductor junction. As light is shined on the junction, the capillary force from the droplet on the cantilever, due to the contact angle change, deflects the cantilever. This wireless actuation can be used as a substitute for complex circuit-based systems currently used for optical addressing and control of autonomous wireless sensors
