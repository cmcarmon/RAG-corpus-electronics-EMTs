Some of the advantages of this converter are that the leakage inductance is in series with the output
diode  when  current  is  delivered  to  the  output,  and,  therefore,  no  Ô¨Ålter  inductor  is  required;  cross
regulation for multiple output converters is good; it is ideally suited for high-voltage output applications;
and it has the lowest cost.
