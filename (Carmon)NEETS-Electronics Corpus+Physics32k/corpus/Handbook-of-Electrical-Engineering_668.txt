Chaotic synchronization: The process by which a dynamical system is synchronized with a chaotic reference
signal. In chaotic digital communications, chaotic (rather than periodic) basis functions must be recov-
ered without distortion from the noisy received (reference) signal at the receiver. Noise corrupting the
reference signal must be suppressed as much as possible.
