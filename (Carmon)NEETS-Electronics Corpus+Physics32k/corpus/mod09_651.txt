The POSITIVE-DIODE COUNTER circuit is used in timing or counting circuits in which the 
number of input pulses are represented by the output voltage. The output may indicate frequency, count 
the rpm of a shaft, or register a number of operations. The counter establishes a direct relationship 
between the input frequency and the average dc output voltage. As the input frequency increases, the 
output voltage also increases; conversely, as the input frequency decreases, the output voltage decreases. 
In effect, the positive counter counts the number of positive input pulses by producing an average dc 
output voltage proportional to the repetition frequency of the input signal. For accurate counting, the 
pulse repetition frequency must be the only variable parameter in the input signal. Therefore, careful 
shaping and limiting of the input signal is essential for you to ensure that the pulses are of uniform width 
and that the amplitude is constant. When properly filtered and smoothed, the dc output voltage of the 
counter may be used to operate a direct reading indicator.
