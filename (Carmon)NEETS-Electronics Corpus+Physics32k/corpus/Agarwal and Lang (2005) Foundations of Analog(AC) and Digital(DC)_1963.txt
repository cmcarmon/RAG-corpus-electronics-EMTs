The complete solution is sketched in Figure 13.49 for C1 too small, correctly
chosen, and too large. The correct choice is obviously the one that makes K
equal to zero in Equation 13.138, so that there is no transient. This is equivalent
to making the capacitor voltage at t = 0
+
, Equation 13.136, equal to the final
