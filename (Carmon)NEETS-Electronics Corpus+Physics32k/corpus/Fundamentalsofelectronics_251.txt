note: This proof of power conservation can be generalized in another very interesting way. All we
need is a set of voltages that obey KVL and a set of currents that obey KCL. Thus, for a given
circuit topology (the speciﬁc way elements are interconnected), the voltages and currents can be
measured at diﬀerent times and the sum of v-i products is zero.
