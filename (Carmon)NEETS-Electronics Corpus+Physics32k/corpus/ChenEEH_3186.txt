The major limitation with this method is that it is labor
intensive and expensive (more so when using dry-type
cleaning agents). In addition, there is no reliable method
other than past service experience to determine when, and if,
insulator cleaning is necessary. Caution should be exercised in
cleaning nonceramic insulators because not all designs and
materials can be washed at high-pressure with water.
