b) Determine the impedance Z that must be added in series with Z1 such that the total
impedance Z2 is equivalent to a pure resistance at frequency ω0. What is this value
of this resistance?
For a parallel RLC network with R = 1 k, L = 1/12 H, C =
e x e r c i s e 14.2
1/3 µF, find ω0, f0, α, Q0, ωd, ω1, ω2, and β = ω2 − ω1. (ω1 and ω2 are the half-power
frequencies.)
