Gay-Lussac's law, Amontons' law or the pressure law was found by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1809. It states that, for a given mass and constant volume of an ideal gas, the pressure exerted on the sides of its container is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.
As a mathematical equation, Gay-Lussac's law is written as either:




P
‚àù
T



{\displaystyle P\propto T\,}
, or




P

/

T
=
k


{\displaystyle P/T=k}
, or
K=P divided by T





P

T

P

{\displaystyle P_{1}/T_{1}=P_{2}/T_{2}}
,
where P is the pressure, T is the absolute temperature, and k is another proportionality constant.
