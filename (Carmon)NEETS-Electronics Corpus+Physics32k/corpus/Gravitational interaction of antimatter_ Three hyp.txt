Thus far, there are three hypotheses about how antimatter gravitationally interacts with normal matter:
Normal gravity: The standard assumption is that gravitational interactions of matter and antimatter are identical.
Antigravity: Some authors argue that antimatter repels matter with the same magnitude as matter attracts itself. (see below).
Gravivector and graviscalar: Later difficulties in creating quantum gravity theories have led to the idea that antimatter may react with a slightly different magnitude.
