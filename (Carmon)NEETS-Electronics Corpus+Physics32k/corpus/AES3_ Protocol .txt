The low-level protocol for data transmission in AES3 and S/PDIF is largely identical, and the following discussion applies for S/PDIF, except as noted.
AES3 was designed primarily to support stereo PCM encoded audio in either DAT format at 48 kHz or CD format at 44.1 kHz. No attempt was made to use a carrier able to support both rates; instead, AES3 allows the data to be run at any rate, and encoding the clock and the data together using biphase mark code (BMC).
Each bit occupies one time slot.
Each audio sample (of up to 24 bits) is combined with four flag bits and a synchronisation preamble which is four time slots long to make a subframe of 32 time slots.
Two subframes (A and B, normally used for left and right audio channels) make a frame. Frames contain 64 time slots and are produced once per sample time. This determines the clock rate.
At the highest level, each 192 consecutive frames are grouped into an audio block. While samples repeat each frame time, metadata is only transmitted once per audio block.
At the default 48 kHz frame rate, there are 250 audio blocks per second, and 3,072 kilobits per second with a biphase clock of 6.144 MHz
The 32 time slots of each subframe are assigned as follows:
