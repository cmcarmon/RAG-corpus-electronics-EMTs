An ideal capacitor, once charged and disconnected, the current being zero, will retain a potential
difference for an indeÔ¨Ånite length of time. Also, the voltage across a capacitor cannot change
value instantaneously, while an instantaneous change in the capacitor current is quite possible.
The student is encouraged to reason through and justify the statement made here by recalling
Equation (1.2.17).
