Again we notice that the gain depends only on the external resistors.
Notice that if feedback resistor Rf ⫽ 0 (short circuit) or R1 ⫽ ⬁
(open  circuit)  or  both,  the  gain  becomes  1.  Under  these  conditions
(Rf ⫽ 0  and  R1 ⫽ ⬁),  the  circuit  in  Fig.  5.16  becomes  that  shown
in  Fig.  5.17,  which  is  called  a  voltage  follower (or  unity  gain
ampliﬁer)  because  the  output  follows  the  input. Thus,  for  a  voltage
follower
