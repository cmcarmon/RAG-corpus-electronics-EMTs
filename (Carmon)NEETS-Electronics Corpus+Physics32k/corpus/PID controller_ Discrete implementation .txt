The analysis for designing a digital implementation of a PID controller in a microcontroller (MCU) or FPGA device requires the standard form of the PID controller to be discretized. Approximations for first-order derivatives are made by backward finite differences. The integral term is discretised, with a sampling time



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
, as follows,





∫

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{t_{k}}{e(\tau )}\,{d\tau }=\sum _{i=1}^{k}e(t_{i})\Delta t}

The derivative term is approximated as,

{\displaystyle {\dfrac {de(t_{k})}{dt}}={\dfrac {e(t_{k})-e(t_{k-1})}{\Delta t}}}

Thus, a velocity algorithm for implementation of the discretized PID controller in a MCU is obtained by differentiating



u
(
t
)


{\displaystyle u(t)}
, using the numerical definitions of the first and second derivative and solving for



u
(

)


{\displaystyle u(t_{k})}
and finally obtaining:
