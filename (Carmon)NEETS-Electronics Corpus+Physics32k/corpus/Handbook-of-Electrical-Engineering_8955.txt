Capacitive.  Capacitive  overlay  technology  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 89.12 where a transparent metallic coating is placed over the
display  screen  and  the  ﬁnger  or  stylus  capacitance  is  sensed  to
determine the touch location. The overlay may consist of a group
of  separate  sections  etched  into  the  surface  with  each  separate
section connected to the controller, or a continuous surface con-
nected at the four corners. The ﬁrst form is termed discrete capac-
itive,  and  touch  location  is  determined  by  having  each  section
sequentially connected to an oscillator circuit where the frequency
of  oscillations  is  affected  by  the  pointing  device.  The  oscillation
frequency  is  measured  and  compared  to  a  stored  reference  fre-
quency. If the frequency difference is large enough then it is rec-
ognized as a touch at that location. It is a simple system, but suffers
from low resolution and slow response so that it is only practical
for menu selection.
