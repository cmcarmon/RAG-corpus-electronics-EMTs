JFET Output Resistance
Dynamic Drain-to-Source Conductance
For the JFET in the active region the drain current IDS is a strong function of the gate-to-source voltage VGS
but  is  relatively  independent  of  the  drain-to-source  voltage  VDS.  The  transfer  equation  has  previously  been
stated as IDS = IDSS [1 â€“ (VG S /VP)]2.
