There are five different phases involved in the data synchronization process:
data extraction from the source (or master, or main) system;
data transfer;
data transformation;
data load to the target system.
data updation
Each of these steps is critical. In case of large amounts of data, the synchronization process needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid any negative impact on performance.
