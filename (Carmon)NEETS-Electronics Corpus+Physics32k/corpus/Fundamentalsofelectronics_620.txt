An important detail emerges when we examine each framed signal (Figure 5.15). At the frame’s edges,
the signal may change very abruptly, a feature not present in the original signal. A transform of such a
segment reveals a curious oscillation in the spectrum, an artifact directly related to this sharp amplitude
change. A better way to frame signals for spectrograms is to apply a window: Shape the signal values
within a frame so that the signal decays gracefully as it nears the edges. This shaping is accomplished
by multiplying the framed signal by the sequence w (n). In sectioning the signal, we essentially applied a
rectangular window: w (n) = 1, 0 ≤ n ≤ N − 1. A much more graceful window is the Hanning window;
it has the cosine shape w (n) = 1

spurious oscillations in each frame’s spectrum. Considering the spectrum of the Hanning windowed frame,
we ﬁnd that the oscillations resulting from applying the rectangular window obscured a formant (the one
located at a little more than half the Nyquist frequency).
