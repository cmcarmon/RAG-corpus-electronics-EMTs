A Néel wall is a narrow transition region between magnetic domains, named after the French physicist Louis Néel. In the Néel wall, the magnetization smoothly rotates from the direction of magnetization within the first domain to the direction of magnetization within the second. In contrast to Bloch walls, the magnetization rotates in plane of the domain wall. It consists of a core with fast varying rotation and two tails where the rotation logarithmically decays. Néel walls are the common magnetic domain wall type in very thin films where the exchange length is very large compared to the thickness. Néel walls would spread across the whole volume if not for magnetic anisotropy.
