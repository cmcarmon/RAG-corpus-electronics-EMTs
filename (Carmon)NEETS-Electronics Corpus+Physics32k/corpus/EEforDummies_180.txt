With all circuits (whether AC or DC), if you start at any point in the circuit, 
and add the voltage rises and drops going around the circuit, you get zero 
volts. In other words, the net sum of the voltage rises and drops in  voltage 
around a circuit is zero. (This rule is known as Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. 
Kirchhoff is pronounced “keer‐cough.”)
