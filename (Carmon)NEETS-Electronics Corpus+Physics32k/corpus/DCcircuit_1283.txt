Working voltage: Since capacitors are nothing more than two conductors separated by an
insulator (the dielectric), you must pay attention to the maximum voltage allowed across it. If
too much voltage is applied, the ”breakdown” rating of the dielectric material may be exceeded,
resulting in the capacitor internally short-circuiting.
