The dependent source of Figure 15.6 by itself is clearly an imperfect model
of an Op Amp. The saturation so clearly present in Figure 15.3c is missing
from Figure 15.5 and from the model of Figure 15.6, as is the temperature
dependence. To simplify the initial discussion, we shall ignore saturation effects
in Op Amps when discussing linear circuits by assuming that we always operate
in the central linear part of the amplifier characteristic. We will specifically
examine saturation behavior of Op Amps in Section 15.7.
