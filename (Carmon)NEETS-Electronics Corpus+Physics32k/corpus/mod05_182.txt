In a series motor, the rheostat speed control may be connected either in parallel or in series with the 
armature windings. In either case, moving the rheostat in a direction that lowers the voltage across the 
armature lowers the current through the armature and slows the motor. Moving the rheostat in a direction 
that increases the voltage and current through the armature increases motor speed.
