Filters
Filters  are  combinations  of  microwave  passive  elements  designed  to  have  a  speciﬁed  frequency  response.
Typically,  a  topology  of  a  ﬁlter  is  chosen  based  on  established  lumped  element  ﬁlter  design  theory.  Then
computer-aided design techniques are used to optimize the response of the circuit to the desired response.
