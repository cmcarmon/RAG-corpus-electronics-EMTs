The Core phase begins a week before the encounter, and continues for two days after the encounter. The majority of the science data will be collected within 48 hours of the closest approach in a phase called the Inner Core. Closest approach will occur January 1, 2019, at 05:33 UTC, at which point it will be 43.4 AU from the Sun. At this distance, the one-way duration for radio signals between Earth and New Horizons will be 6 hours.
