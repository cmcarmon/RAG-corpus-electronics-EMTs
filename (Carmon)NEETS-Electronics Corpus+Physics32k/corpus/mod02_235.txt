flows in the circuit. Current will continue to flow until the charges on the two plates become equal. At this
point, current ceases to flow. With a dc voltage source, current will flow in the circuit only long enough to
charge (or discharge) the capacitor. Thus, a capacitor does NOT allow dc current to flow continuously in a
circuit.
