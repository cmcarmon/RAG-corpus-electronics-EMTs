Second, the gain is nonlinear. From Table 7.1, when the input changes
from 2 V to 2.1 V, the output changes from 5 V to 4 V, exhibiting a local
voltage gain of 10. However, when the input changes from 1.4 V to 1.5 V, the
output changes by merely 0.4 V, exhibiting a local voltage gain of 4. This fact is
evident from the different slopes at various points in the transfer curve shown
in Figure 7.22.
