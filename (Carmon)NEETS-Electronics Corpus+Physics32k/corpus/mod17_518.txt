Generally speaking, three sizes of parabolic-type antennas are currently in use at earth terminal sites. 
These are a parabolic antenna sixty feet in diameter, a parabolic antenna forty feet in diameter, and a 
cluster of four parabolic antennas, each ten feet in diameter. These four in combination are equal to a 
parabolic antenna eighteen feet in diameter. They are shown in figures 4-10, 4-11, and 4-12, respectively.
