Molecular masses of proteins are often expressed in daltons. For example, a molecule of a protein with molar mass 64000 g⋅mol−1 has a mass of 64 kDa.
In research and commerce, the degree of polymerization of synthetic polymers is conventionally expressed in daltons.
The US Supreme Court based a major precedent of appellate law on a disputed case of counting daltons for a molecular distribution.
