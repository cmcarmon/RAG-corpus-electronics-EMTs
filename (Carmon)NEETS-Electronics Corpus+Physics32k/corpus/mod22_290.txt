To progress from this example to preparing a program for a computer is not difficult. However, one 
basic characteristic of the computer must be kept in mind. It cannot think. It can only follow certain 
commands, and these commands must be correctly expressed and must cover all possibilities. Thus, if a 
program is to be useful in a computer, it must be broken down into specifically defined operations or 
steps. Then the instructions, along with other data necessary for performing these operations or steps, 
must be communicated to the computer in the form of a language or code that is acceptable to the 
machine. In broad terms, the computer follows certain steps in executing a program. It must first read the 
instructions (sequentially unless otherwise programmed), and then in accordance with these instructions, 
it executes the following procedures:
