Rising Step Load Testing (or RSL testing) is a testing system that can apply loads in tension or bending. It was specifically designed to conduct the accelerated ASTM F1624 step-modified, slow strain rate tests on a variety of test coupons or structural components. It can also function to conduct conventional ASTM E8 tensile tests; ASTM F519 200-hr Sustained Load Tests with subsequent programmable step loads to rupture for increased reliability; and ASTM G129 Slow Strain Rate Tensile tests.
