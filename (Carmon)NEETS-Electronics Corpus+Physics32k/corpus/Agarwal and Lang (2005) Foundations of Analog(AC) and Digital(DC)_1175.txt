Figure 8.42c depicts the small-signal model of the BJT based on the piecewise-linear
model in Figure 8.42b. In the active region, the ideal diode in Figure 8.42b behaves
like a short circuit. Furthermore, the 0.6-V voltage source appears as a short circuit for
incremental changes. Finally, since the active region relationship between iB and iC is
linear, and given by
