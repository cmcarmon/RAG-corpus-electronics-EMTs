instead of multiple planes in some context-switchable FPGAs
(Tau et al., 1995), hence reducing area and speed overheads.
Related ideas on conﬁguration caching algorithms have been
explored by Li et al. (2000); their algorithms include relocation
and defragmentation techniques that allocate and combine
conﬁguration data at run time.
