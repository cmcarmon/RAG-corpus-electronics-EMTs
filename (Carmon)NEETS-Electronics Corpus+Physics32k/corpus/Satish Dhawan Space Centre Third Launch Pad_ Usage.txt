This launch pad is intended to be used for future Indian rockets like the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk III and Avatar RLV (Avatar Reusable Launch Vehicle) as well as the older ones like Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. This is the launch pad which will be used for the Indian human spaceflight programme as well as for India's manned mission to the Moon. One of the main reasons of building this launch pad is that it will increase the frequency of orbital launches by ISRO.
