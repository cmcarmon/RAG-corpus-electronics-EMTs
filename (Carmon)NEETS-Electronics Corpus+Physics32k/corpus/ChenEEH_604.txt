Although MCTs have signiÔ¨Åcantly improved current-hand-
ling capability, they do not match the switching performance
of IGBTs. This is due to the increased resistance in the device
during turn-on and higher current density. During the turn-
off stage, the thyristor may fail to turn off if resistance of the
diverting channel is high. In addition the channel has to be
formed uniformly and abruptly to effectively cut off the feed-
back in the thyristor.
