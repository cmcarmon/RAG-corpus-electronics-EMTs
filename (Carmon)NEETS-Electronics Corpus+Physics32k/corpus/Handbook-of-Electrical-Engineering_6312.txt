Saturation: The intensity of the colors in the active picture, the voltage levels of the colors. Saturation relates
to  the  degree  by  which  the  eye  perceives  a  color  as  departing  from  a  gray  or  white  scale  of  the  same
brightness. A 100% saturated color does not contain any white; adding white reduces saturation. In NTSC
and  PAL  video  signals,  the  color  saturation  at  any  particular  instant  in  the  picture  is  conveyed  by  the
corresponding instantaneous amplitude of the active video subcarrier.
