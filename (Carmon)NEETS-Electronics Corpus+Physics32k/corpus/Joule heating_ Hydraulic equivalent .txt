In the energy balance of groundwater flow a hydraulic equivalent of Joule's law is used:

K




{\displaystyle {dE \over dx}={v_{x}^{2} \over K}}

where:




d

{\displaystyle dE/dx}
= loss of hydraulic energy (



E


{\displaystyle E}
) due to friction of flow in



x


{\displaystyle x}
-direction per unit of time (m/day) – comparable to



P


{\displaystyle P}






v

x




{\displaystyle v_{x}}
= flow velocity in

{\displaystyle x}
-direction (m/day) – comparable to



I


{\displaystyle I}





K


{\displaystyle K}
= hydraulic conductivity of the soil (m/day) – the hydraulic conductivity is inversely proportional to the hydraulic resistance which compares to



R
