We acknowledge that the total response to a sinusoid is rarely necessary; we
are more often interested in just the forced (or particular) response to sinusoids.
Accordingly, you may skip directly to Section 14.1.2 and then to Section 14.2
without loss of continuity. We, however, will plow through the total response
for completeness.
