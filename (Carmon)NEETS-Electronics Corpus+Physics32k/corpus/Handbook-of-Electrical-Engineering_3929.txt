Feeding Techniques for Microstrip Antennas
While  Fig. 38.14  shows  a  coaxial  probe-fed  microstrip  antenna  element,  it  is  also  possible  to  feed  the  patch
element by several other methods. Fig. 38.19a shows a rectangular patch element fed with a microstrip trans-
mission line coplanar with the patch element. The amount of inset of the feed line controls the input impedance
level  at  resonance,  in  a  manner  analogous  to  the  positioning  of  the  coax  probe  feed  for  impedance  control.
The equivalent circuit of the antenna near resonance is also shown in the ﬁgure. The patch appears as a parallel
RLC resonant circuit, with a series inductance that represents the near-ﬁeld effect of the microstrip feed line.
(The same equivalent circuit applies to the probe-fed microstrip antenna.) Both the probe feed and the line
feed excite the patch element through coupling between the equivalent Jz electric current of the feed and the
Ez directed ﬁeld of the patch resonator, which has a maximum below the center of the patch.
