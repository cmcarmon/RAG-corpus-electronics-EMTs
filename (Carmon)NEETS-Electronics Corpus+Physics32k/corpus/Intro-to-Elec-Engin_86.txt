where λ is the magnetic-ﬂux linkage in weber-turns (Wb·t), N is the number of turns of the coil,
and N ψ is the magnetic ﬂux in webers (Wb) produced by the current i in amperes (A). Figure
1.2.7(a) illustrates a single inductive coil or an inductor of N turns carrying a current i that is
linked by its own ﬂux.
