Two types of cables are commonly used at the transmission voltage level: pipe-type cables and self-contained
oil-Ô¨Ålled  cables.  The  selection  depends  on  voltage,  power  requirements,  length,  cost,  and  reliability.  In  the
United States, over 90% of underground cables are pipe-type design.
