Ohm’s Law also comes in handy when tweaking an existing circuit. Say your 
spouse is trying to sleep but you want to read, so you get out your big flash-
light. The bulb in your flashlight has a resistance of 9 Ω and is powered by a 
6 V battery, so you know that the current in the flashlight circuit is 
6
. Your spouse thinks the light is too bright, so to reduce the 
 V
brightness (and save your marriage), you want to restrict the current flowing 
through the bulb a bit. You think that bringing it down to 0.45 A will do the 
trick, and you know that inserting a resistor in series between the battery 
and the bulb will restrict the current.
