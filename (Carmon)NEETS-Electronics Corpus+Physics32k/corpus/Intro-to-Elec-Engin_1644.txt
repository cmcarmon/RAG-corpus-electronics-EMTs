A good control system, in general, should be rather insensitive to parameter variations, while it
is still able to follow the command quite responsively. It is apparent from Figure 16.2.1 that in an
open-loop system the gain of the system will respond in a one-to-one fashion to the variation in
G. Let us now investigate what effect feedback has on the sensitivity to parameter variations.
