The wall energy depends on the area of the wall, i.e., L 2, while the energy associated with the external magnetic
ﬁeld depends on L 3, the volume of the sample. Clearly, as the size of single particles becomes small, terms in
L 2 are more important than terms in L 3, and so for small magnetic particles, the formation of domain walls
may not be energetically feasible and a single-domain particle results. These are found in the particles of iron
oxide, cobalt-modiﬁed iron oxide, chromium dioxide, iron, or barium ferrite, which are used to make magnetic
recording tapes, and in barium ferrite, samarium cobalt, and neodymium iron boron, which are used to make
powerful permanent magnets. In the latter cases, the very high coercivities are caused by domain walls being
pinned at grain boundaries between the main phase grains and ﬁnely precipitated secondary phases. This is
an example of nucleation-controlled coercivity.
