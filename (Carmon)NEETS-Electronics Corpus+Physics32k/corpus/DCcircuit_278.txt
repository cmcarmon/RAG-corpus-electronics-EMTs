In answer to the third question, dirt is not a very good conductor (at least not when its
dry!). It is too poor of a conductor to support continuous current for powering a load. However,
as we will see in the next section, it takes very little current to injure or kill a human being, so
even the poor conductivity of dirt is enough to provide a path for deadly current when there is
sufÔ¨Åcient voltage available, as there usually is in power systems.
