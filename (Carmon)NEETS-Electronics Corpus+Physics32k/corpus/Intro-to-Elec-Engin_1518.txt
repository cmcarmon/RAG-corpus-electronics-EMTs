In the conversion of analog audio signals to digital form, with the development of the compact
disc (CD) player and the digital audio tape recorder, the most dramatic changes and beneﬁts
have been experienced by the entertainment industry. The CD system, from a systems point
of view, embodies most of the elements of a modern digital communication system: A/D and
D/A conversion, modulation/demodulation, and channel coding/decoding. Figure 15.3.12 shows
a general block diagram of the elements of a CD digital audio system. The sampling rate in a
CD system is chosen to be 44.1 kHz, which is compatible with the video recording equipment
commonly used for digital recording of audio signals on magnetic tape. The samples of both the L
and R signals are quantized using PCM with 16 bits per sample. While the D/A conversion of the
two 16-bit signals at the 44.1-kHz sampling rate is relatively simple, the practical implementation
of a 16-bit D/A converter is very expensive. Because inexpensive D/A converters with 12-bit (or
less) precision are readily available, a method is to be devised for D/A conversion that employs
a low precision (and hence a low-cost D/A converter), while maintaining the 16-bit precision
of the digital audio signal. Without going into details, the practical solution to this problem is
to expand the bandwidth of the digital audio signal by oversampling through interpolation and
digital ﬁltering prior to analog conversion.
