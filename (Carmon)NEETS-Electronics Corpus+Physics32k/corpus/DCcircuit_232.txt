One of the beneﬁts of using a ”primitive” text-based program such as SPICE is that the text
ﬁles dealt with are extremely small compared to other ﬁle formats, especially graphical formats
used in other circuit simulation software. Also, the fact that SPICE’s output is plain text means
you can direct SPICE’s output to another text ﬁle where it may be further manipulated. To do
this, we re-issue a command to the computer’s operating system to invoke SPICE, this time
redirecting the output to a ﬁle I’ll call ”output.txt”:
