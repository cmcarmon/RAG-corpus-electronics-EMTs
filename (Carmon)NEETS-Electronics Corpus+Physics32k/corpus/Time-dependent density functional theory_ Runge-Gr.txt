The approach of Runge and Gross considers a single-component system in the presence of a time-dependent scalar field for which the Hamiltonian takes the form

where T is the kinetic energy operator, W the electron-electron interaction, and Vext(t) the external potential which along with the number of electrons defines the system. Nominally, the external potential contains the electrons' interaction with the nuclei of the system. For non-trivial time-dependence, an additional explicitly time-dependent potential is present which can arise, for example, from a time-dependent electric or magnetic field. The many-body wavefunction evolves according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation under a single initial condition,

Employing the Schrödinger equation as its starting point, the Runge-Gross theorem shows that at any time, the density uniquely determines the external potential. This is done in two steps:
Assuming that the external potential can be expanded in a Taylor series about a given time, it is shown that two external potentials differing by more than an additive constant generate different current densities.
Employing the continuity equation, it is then shown that for finite systems, different current densities correspond to different electron densities.
