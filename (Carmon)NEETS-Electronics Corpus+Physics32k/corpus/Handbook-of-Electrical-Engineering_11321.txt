and can be alleviated by periodic pulsing of the batteries into the capacitors and internally dumping the charge.
This shortens the life of the battery slightly but is not a total waste because the capacitors need this type of
reforming as well. Several methods can be used to predict the end of life of a battery. Common indicators are
the battery’s open-circuit voltage, voltage during charging, and the time it takes to charge the capacitor [Holmes,
1996].  Future  advancements  in  battery  technology  are  critical  in  reducing  deﬁbrillator  size  and  increasing
longevity.
