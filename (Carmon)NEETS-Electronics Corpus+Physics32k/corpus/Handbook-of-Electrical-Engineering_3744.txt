Conclusions
Magnetic recording today is used in a wide variety of formats for a large number of applications. Formats range
from tape, which has the highest volumetric packing density and lowest cost per bit stored, to rigid disks, which
provide  fast  access  to  a  large  volume  of  data.  Applications  include  computer  data  storage,  audio  and  video
recording, and collecting data from scientiÔ¨Åc instruments.
