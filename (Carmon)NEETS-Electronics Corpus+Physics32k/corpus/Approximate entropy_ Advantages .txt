The advantages of ApEn include:
Lower computational demand. ApEn can be designed to work for small data samples (n < 50 points) and can be applied in real time.
Less effect from noise. If data are noisy, the ApEn measure can be compared to the noise level in the data to determine what quality of true information may be present in the data.
