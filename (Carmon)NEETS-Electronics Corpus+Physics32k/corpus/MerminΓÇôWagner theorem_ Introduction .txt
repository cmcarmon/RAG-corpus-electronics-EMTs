Consider the free scalar field φ of mass m in two Euclidean dimensions. Its propagator is:

{\displaystyle G(x)=\left\langle \varphi (x)\varphi (0)\right\rangle =\int {\frac {d^{2}k}{(2\pi )^{2}}}{\frac {e^{ik\cdot x}}{k^{2}+m^{2}}}.}

For small m, G is a solution to Laplace's equation with a point source:





∇

G

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}G=\delta (x).}

This is because the propagator is the reciprocal of ∇2 in k space. To use Gauss's law, define the electric field analog to be E = ∇G. The divergence of the electric field is zero. In two dimensions, using a large Gaussian ring:




E

{\displaystyle E={1 \over 2\pi r}.}

So that the function G has a logarithmic divergence both at small and large r.

{\displaystyle G(r)={1 \over 2\pi }\log(r)}

The interpretation of the divergence is that the field fluctuations cannot stay centered around a mean. If you start at a point where the field has the value 1, the divergence tells you that as you travel far away, the field is arbitrarily far from the starting value. This makes a two dimensional massless scalar field slightly tricky to define mathematically. If you define the field by a Monte-Carlo simulation, it doesn't stay put, it slides to infinitely large values with time.
This happens in one dimension too, when the field is a one dimensional scalar field, a random walk in time. A random walk also moves arbitrarily far from its starting point, so that a one-dimensional or two-dimensional scalar does not have a well defined average value.
If the field is an angle, θ, as it is in the Mexican hat model where the complex field A = Reiθ has an expectation value but is free to slide in the θ direction, the angle θ will be random at large distances. This is the Mermin–Wagner theorem: there is no spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in two dimensions.
