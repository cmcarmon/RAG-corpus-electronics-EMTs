and vertical movement of the mouse. If such a structure is used as the mouse, then the photodetector will pick
up a series of light-dark impulses consisting of the reﬂections from the mirror surface and the grid lines and
convert them into square waves. A second LED and photodetector that is mounted orthogonally to the ﬁrst is
used  to  detect  motion  in  the  orthogonal  direction,  and  the  combination  of  the  two  inks  avoids  confusion
between the two directions of motion. The system then counts the number of impulses created by the mouse
motion and converts the result into motion information for the cursor. This type of mouse has the advantage
that no mechanical elements are required.
