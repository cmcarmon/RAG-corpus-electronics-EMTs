Electrostatics (electricity at rest) is a subject with which most persons entering the field of electricity
and electronics are somewhat familiar. For example, the way a personâ€™s hair stands on end after a
vigorous rubbing is an effect of electrostatics. While pursuing the study of electrostatics, you will gain a
better understanding of this common occurrence. Of even greater significance, the study of electrostatics
will provide you with the opportunity to gain important background knowledge and to develop concepts
which are essential to the understanding of electricity and electronics.
