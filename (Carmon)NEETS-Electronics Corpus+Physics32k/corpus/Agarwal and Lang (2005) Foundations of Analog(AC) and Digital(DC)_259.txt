Note that because each branch current flows into exactly one node and out from exactly
one node, each branch current appears exactly once in Equations 2.5 through 2.8 posi-
tively, and exactly once negatively. This would also be true if Equations 2.5 through 2.8
were all written to state that no net current can flow out from a node. Such patterns can
often be used to spot errors.
