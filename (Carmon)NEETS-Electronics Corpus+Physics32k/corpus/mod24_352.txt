Fresnel refraction occurs twice in a fiber-to-fiber connection. A portion of the optical power is
reflected when the light first exits the source fiber. Light is then reflected as the optical signal enters the
receiving fiber. Fresnel reflection at each interface must be taken into account when calculating the total
fiber-to-fiber coupling loss. Loss from Fresnel reflection may be significant. To reduce the amount of loss
from Fresnel reflection, the air gap can be filled with an index matching gel. The refractive index of the
index matching gel should match the refractive index of the fiber core. Index matching gel reduces the
step change in the refractive index at the fiber interface, reducing Fresnel reflection.
