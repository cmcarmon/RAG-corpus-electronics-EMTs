In a reciprocal LFI network, each player can hear, and be heard by, the same people. For example, in the following chart we can see each player's headphone-mates:
Since each player can both hear and be heard by the same subset of players, direct musical interaction and imitation can take place. This variety of LFI matrix is the 'drum circle' type, since playing in it is like playing in a drum circle, wherein one can hear one's immediate neighbors, and one's immediate neighbors can do the same. However, each player's "immediate neighors" are unique, which effectively gives each player a unique monitor mix within which to improvise.
