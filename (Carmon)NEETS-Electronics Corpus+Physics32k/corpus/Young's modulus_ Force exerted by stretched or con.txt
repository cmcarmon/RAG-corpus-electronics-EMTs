The Young's modulus of a material can be used to calculate the force it exerts under specific strain.




F
=



E
A
Δ
L


L

0






{\displaystyle F={\frac {EA\Delta L}{L_{0}}}}

where F is the force exerted by the material when contracted or stretched by ΔL.
Hooke's law for a stretched wire can be derived from this formula:




F
=

(



E
A


L

0




)

Δ
L
=
k
x



{\displaystyle F=\left({\frac {EA}{L_{0}}}\right)\Delta L=kx\,}

where it comes in saturation




k
≡







E
A


L

0











{\displaystyle k\equiv {\begin{matrix}{\frac {EA}{L_{0}}}\end{matrix}}\,}
and



x
≡
Δ
L
.



{\displaystyle x\equiv \Delta L.\,}

But note that the elasticity of coiled springs comes from shear modulus, not Young's modulus.
