Particles with



β
≥
0.5


{\displaystyle \beta \geq 0.5}
have radiation pressure at least half as strong as gravity, and will pass out of the Solar System on hyperbolic orbits if their initial velocities were Keplerian. For rocky dust particles, this corresponds to a diameter of less than 1 µm.
Particles with



0.1
<
β
<
0.5


{\displaystyle 0.1<\beta <0.5}
may spiral inwards or outwards depending on their size and initial velocity vector; they tend to stay in eccentric orbits.
Particles with



β
≈
0.1


{\displaystyle \beta \approx 0.1}
take around 10,000 years to spiral into the sun from a circular orbit at 1 AU. In this regime, inspiraling time and particle diameter are both roughly



∝


1
β




{\displaystyle \propto {1 \over \beta }}
.
Note that, if the initial grain velocity was not Keplerian, then circular or any confined orbit is possible for



β
<

{\displaystyle \beta <1}
.
It has been theorized that the slowing down of the sun's outer layer may be caused by a similar effect.
