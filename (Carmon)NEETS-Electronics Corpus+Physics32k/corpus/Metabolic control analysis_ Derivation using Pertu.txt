Control equations can also be derived by considering the effect of perturbations on the system. Consider that reaction rates




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
are determined by two enzymes




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
respectively. Changing either enzyme will result in a change to the steady state level of



x


{\displaystyle x}
and the steady state reaction rates



v


{\displaystyle v}
. Consider a small change in




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
of magnitude



δ

e

1




{\displaystyle \delta e_{1}}
. This will have a number of effects, it will increase




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
which in turn will increase



x


{\displaystyle x}
which in turn will increase




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
. Eventually the system will settle to a new steady state. We can describe these changes by focusing on the change in




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
. The change in




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
, which we designate



δ

v

2




{\displaystyle \delta v_{2}}
, came about as a result of the change



δ
x


{\displaystyle \delta x}
. Because we are only considering small changes we can express the change



δ

v

2




{\displaystyle \delta v_{2}}
in terms of



δ
x


{\displaystyle \delta x}
using the relation:




δ

v

2


=



∂

v

2




∂
x



δ
x


{\displaystyle \delta v_{2}={\frac {\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}}\delta x}

where the derivative



∂

v

2



/

∂
x


{\displaystyle \partial v_{2}/\partial x}
measures how responsive




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
is to changes in



x


{\displaystyle x}
. The derivative can be computed if we know the rate law for




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
. For example, if we assume that the rate law is




v

2


=

k

2


x


{\displaystyle v_{2}=k_{2}x}
then the derivative is




k

2




{\displaystyle k_{2}}
. We can also use a similar strategy to compute the change in




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
as a result of the change



δ

e

1




{\displaystyle \delta e_{1}}
. This time the change in




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
is a result of two changes, the change in




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
itself and the change in



x


{\displaystyle x}
. We can express these changes by summing the two individual contributions:




δ

v

1


=



∂

v

1




∂

e

1





δ

e

1


+



∂

v

1




∂
x



δ
x


{\displaystyle \delta v_{1}={\frac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial e_{1}}}\delta e_{1}+{\frac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial x}}\delta x}

We have two equations, one describing the change in




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and the other in




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
. Because we allowed the system to settle to a new steady state we can also state that the change in reaction rates must be the same (otherwise it wouldn't be at steady state). That is we can assert that



δ

v

1


=
δ

v

2




{\displaystyle \delta v_{1}=\delta v_{2}}
. With this in mind we equate the two equations and write:







∂

v

2




∂
x



δ
x
=



∂

v

1




∂

e

1





δ

e

1


+



∂

v

∂
x



δ
x


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}}\delta x={\frac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial e_{1}}}\delta e_{1}+{\frac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial x}}\delta x}

Solving for the ratio



δ
x

/

δ

e

1




{\displaystyle \delta x/\delta e_{1}}
we obtain:







δ
x


δ

∂
x










{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta x}{\delta e_{1}}}={\dfrac {-{\dfrac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial e_{1}}}}{{\dfrac {\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}}-{\dfrac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial x}}}}}

In the limit, as we make the change



δ

e

1




{\displaystyle \delta e_{1}}
smaller and smaller, the left-hand side converges to the derivative



d
x

/

d

e

{\displaystyle \lim _{\delta e_{1}\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\delta x}{\delta e_{1}}}={\frac {dx}{de_{1}}}={\dfrac {-{\dfrac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial e_{1}}}}{{\dfrac {\partial v_{2}}{\partial x}}-{\dfrac {\partial v_{1}}{\partial x}}}}}

We can go one step further and scale the derivatives to eliminate units. Multiplying both sides by




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and dividing both sides by $x$ yields the scaled derivatives:

The scaled derivatives on the right-hand side are the elasticities,




ε

x


v




{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{x}^{v}}
and the scaled left-hand term is the scaled sensitivity coefficient or concentration control coefficient,




C

e

{\displaystyle C_{e}^{x}}

{\displaystyle C_{e_{1}}^{x}={\frac {\varepsilon _{e_{1}}^{1}}{\varepsilon _{x}^{2}-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}}}

We can simplify this expression further. The reaction rate




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
is usually a linear function of




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
. For example, in the Briggs-Haldane equation, the reaction rate is given by



v
=

e

1



k

c
a
t


x

/

(

K

m


+
x
)


{\displaystyle v=e_{1}k_{cat}x/(K_{m}+x)}
. Differentiating this rate law with respect to




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and scaling yields:




ε


e

1





v

1




=
1


{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{e_{1}}^{v_{1}}=1}
.
Using this result gives:





C

x


=

ε

x

−

ε

x


1







{\displaystyle C_{e_{1}}^{x}={\frac {1}{\varepsilon _{x}^{2}-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}}}

A similar analysis can be done where




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
is perturbed. In this case we obtain the sensitivity of



x


{\displaystyle x}
with respect to




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
:





C

x

{\displaystyle C_{e_{2}}^{x}=-{\frac {1}{\varepsilon _{x}^{2}-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}}}

The above expressions measure how much enzymes




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
control the steady state concentration of intermediate



x


{\displaystyle x}
. We can also consider how the steady state reaction rates




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
are affected by perturbations in




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
. This is often of importance to metabolic engineers who are interested in increasing rates of production. At steady state the reaction rates are often called the fluxes and abbreviated to




J

1




{\displaystyle J_{1}}
and




J

2




{\displaystyle J_{2}}
. For a linear pathway such this example, both fluxes are equal at steady state so that the flux through the pathway is simply referred to as



J


{\displaystyle J}
. Expressing the change in flux as a result of a perturbations in




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and taking the limit as before we obtain:




C

{\displaystyle C_{e_{1}}^{J}={\frac {\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}{\varepsilon _{x}^{2}-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}},\quad C_{e_{2}}^{J}={\frac {-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}{\varepsilon _{x}^{2}-\varepsilon _{x}^{1}}}}

The above expressions tell us how much enzymes




e

1




{\displaystyle e_{1}}
and




e

2




{\displaystyle e_{2}}
control the steady state flux. The key point here is that changes in enzyme concentration, or equivalently the enzyme activity, must be brought about by an external action.
