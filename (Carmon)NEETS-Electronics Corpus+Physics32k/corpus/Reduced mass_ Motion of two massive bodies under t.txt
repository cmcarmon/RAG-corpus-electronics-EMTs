{\displaystyle V(|\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _{2}|)=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{|\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _{2}|}}\,,}

we find that the position of the first body with respect to the second is governed by the same differential equation as the position of a body with the reduced mass orbiting a body with a mass equal to the sum of the two masses, because
