The Raspberry Pi is a series of single‐board computers that you connect 
to your TV or monitor and a standard keyboard. The original Pi runs the 
Linux operating system, but the second generation Pi runs both Linux and 
a  version of Windows 10. You program the Pi using Python or any one of 
a number of IDEs. Although it’s not as beginner‐friendly as Arduino, the 
Raspberry Pi is as inexpensive (roughly $35) and has a large online user 
community. Intended as an educational tool for teaching kids programming 
skills, the Raspberry Pi is enjoying tremendous popularity and finding itself 
at the heart of many computer‐embedded hobby projects, such as an Internet 
radio and an infrared bird box. You’ll learn more about programming rather 
than down‐and‐dirty electronics with the Raspberry Pi, but you certainly can 
come up with ideas that integrate the two skill sets. Check out Raspberry Pi
