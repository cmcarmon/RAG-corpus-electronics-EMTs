In most cases the transaction price to be paid will be stipulated in the contract and quite easy to calculate; however certain circumstances require that a transaction price should be estimated by other methods.
Firstly, an entity has to measure the amount of non-cash consideration in a contract in terms of IFRS 13: fair value measurement.
Secondly, a contract can have variable consideration (for example, the transaction price is subject to settlement discount should the client pay within a certain time frame). In this case, the transaction price can be calculated by two methods:
The most likely amount: the amount that of considerations that has the highest probability of realizing will be measured as the transaction price, or
Expected value approach; in this case the weighed average of possible amounts will be measured as the transaction price.
Both of the above-mentioned are estimates, and should the estimates change, the entity will apply the change prospectively in terms of the criteria of IAS 8.
Lastly IFRS 15 requires that the entity should test for the existence of a “significant financing component” in the contract, this will occur if: “the timing of payments agreed by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer”
If the above-mentioned is applicable, the transaction price will be adjusted to eliminate the effect of this benefit. This is simply done by calculating the net present value of the payments (if the satisfaction of performance obligations is prior to the payment date), or by calculating the net future value (if the payment date is prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations). The difference (between the amount recognized after adjustment for a significant financing component and amount of consideration to be received) is simply recognized as interest income/ expense in terms of the accrual basis of accounting as mentioned in IAS 1.
