Now, solid-state transistor ampliﬁer circuits accomplish the same task in digital meter de-
signs. While this approach (of using an ampliﬁer to boost the measured signal current) works
well, it vastly complicates the design of the meter, making it nearly impossible for the begin-
ning electronics student to comprehend its internal workings.
