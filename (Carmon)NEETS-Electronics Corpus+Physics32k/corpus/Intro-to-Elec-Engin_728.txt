The purpose of electronic ampliﬁers is essentially to increase the amplitude and power of a signal
so that either useful work is done or information processing is realized. The output signal power
being greater than the input signal power, the additional power is supplied by the bias supply.
Thus, the ampliﬁer action is one of energy conversion in which the bias power is converted to
signal power within the device.
