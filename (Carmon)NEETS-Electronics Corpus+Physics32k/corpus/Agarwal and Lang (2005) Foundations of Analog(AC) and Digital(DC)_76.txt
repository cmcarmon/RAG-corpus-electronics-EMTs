Consider the familiar lightbulb. When it is connected by a pair of cables to
a battery, as shown in Figure 1.4a, it lights up. Suppose we are interested in
finding out the amount of current flowing through the bulb. We might go about
this by employing Maxwellâ€™s equations and deriving the amount of current by
