A rotational inertia based formula similar to Robins' was derived by French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson and published in The Mécanique Physique, for measuring the bullet velocity by using the recoil of the gun:




m
v
c
f
=
M
b

k
′



g
h




{\displaystyle mvcf=Mbk'{\sqrt {gh}}}

where:




m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the bullet




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity of the bullet




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the distance from pivot to the ribbon




f


{\displaystyle f}
is the distance from bore axis to pivot point




M


{\displaystyle M}
is the combined mass of gun and pendulum




b


{\displaystyle b}
is the chord measured by the ribbon





k
′



{\displaystyle k'}
is the radius from pivot to the center of mass of gun and pendulum (measured by oscillation, as per Robins)




g


{\displaystyle g}
is gravitational acceleration




h


{\displaystyle h}
is the distance from the center of mass of the pendulum to the pivot





k
′



{\displaystyle k'}
can be calculated with the equation:




T
=
π




k

′

2




g
h






{\displaystyle T=\pi {\sqrt {\frac {k'^{2}}{gh}}}}

Where



T


{\displaystyle T}
is half the period of oscillation.
