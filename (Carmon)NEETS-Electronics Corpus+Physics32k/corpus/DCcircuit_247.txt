With this lesson, I hope to avoid a common mistake found in electronics textbooks of either
ignoring or not covering with sufÔ¨Åcient detail the subject of electrical safety. I assume that
whoever reads this book has at least a passing interest in actually working with electricity, and
as such the topic of safety is of paramount importance. Those authors, editors, and publishers
who fail to incorporate this subject into their introductory texts are depriving the reader of
life-saving information.
