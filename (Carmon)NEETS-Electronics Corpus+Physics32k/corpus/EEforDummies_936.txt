Although I strongly recommend that you avoid 
working with circuits that run directly off house-
hold current, I realize you can’t always do this. 
Here are some tips designed to help you avoid 
electrocution  if  you  choose  to  work  with  AC 
power:
▶✓ Use a self‐contained power supply. If your 
project requires an AC power supply (which 
converts the AC to lower‐voltage DC), using 
a self‐contained power supply, such as a 
plug‐in wall transformer, is much safer than 
using  a  homemade  power  supply.  A wall 
transformer is a little black box with plug 
prongs, such as the one you use to charge 
your cellphone.
