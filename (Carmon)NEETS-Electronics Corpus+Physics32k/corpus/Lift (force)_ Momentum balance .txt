At some point, the downward momentum of the air in the wake must be counteracted by an upward force, in order to ensure that the net momentum change is zero. This force is supplied by the ground over which the airfoil is flying.
When it meets the ground, the downward-moving wake establishes a pattern of higher-than-ambient pressure, as shown on the right For steady, level flight, the integrated pressure force associated with this pattern is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane's weight. According to Newton's third law, this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal-and-opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground, which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane. The net force due to the lift, acting on the atmosphere as a whole, is therefore zero, and there is thus no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere.
