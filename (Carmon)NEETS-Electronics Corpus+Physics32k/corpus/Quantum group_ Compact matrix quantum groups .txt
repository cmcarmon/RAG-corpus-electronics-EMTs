See also compact quantum group.
S. L. Woronowicz introduced compact matrix quantum groups. Compact matrix quantum groups are abstract structures on which the "continuous functions" on the structure are given by elements of a C*-algebra. The geometry of a compact matrix quantum group is a special case of a noncommutative geometry.
The continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space form a commutative C*-algebra. By the Gelfand theorem, a commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space, and the topological space is uniquely determined by the C*-algebra up to homeomorphism.
For a compact topological group, G, there exists a C*-algebra homomorphism Δ: C(G) → C(G) ⊗ C(G) (where C(G) ⊗ C(G) is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of C(G) and C(G)), such that Δ(f)(x, y) = f(xy) for all f ∈ C(G), and for all x, y ∈ G (where (f ⊗ g)(x, y) = f(x)g(y) for all f, g ∈ C(G) and all x, y ∈ G). There also exists a linear multiplicative mapping κ: C(G) → C(G), such that κ(f)(x) = f(x−1) for all f ∈ C(G) and all x ∈ G. Strictly, this does not make C(G) a Hopf algebra, unless G is finite. On the other hand, a finite-dimensional representation of G can be used to generate a *-subalgebra of C(G) which is also a Hopf *-algebra. Specifically, if



g

(

u

i

j




{\displaystyle g\mapsto (u_{ij}(g))_{i,j}}
is an n-dimensional representation of G, then for all i, j uij ∈ C(G) and

{\displaystyle \Delta (u_{ij})=\sum _{k}u_{ik}\otimes u_{kj}.}

It follows that the *-algebra generated by uij for all i, j and κ(uij) for all i, j is a Hopf *-algebra: the counit is determined by ε(uij) = δij for all i, j (where δij is the Kronecker delta), the antipode is κ, and the unit is given by

As a generalization, a compact matrix quantum group is defined as a pair (C, fu), where C is a C*-algebra and

{\displaystyle u=(u_{ij})_{i,j=1,\dots ,n}}
is a matrix with entries in C such that

The *-subalgebra, C0, of C, which is generated by the matrix elements of u, is dense in C;

There exists a C*-algebra homomorphism called the comultiplication Δ: C → C ⊗ C (where C ⊗ C is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of C and C) such that for all i, j we have:




Δ
(

∑

⊗

u

j




{\displaystyle \Delta (u_{ij})=\sum _{k}u_{ik}\otimes u_{kj}}


There exists a linear antimultiplicative map κ: C0 → C0 (the coinverse) such that κ(κ(v*)*) = v for all v ∈ C0 and

I

{\displaystyle \sum _{k}\kappa (u_{ik})u_{kj}=\sum _{k}u_{ik}\kappa (u_{kj})=\delta _{ij}I,}


where I is the identity element of C. Since κ is antimultiplicative, then κ(vw) = κ(w) κ(v) for all v, w in C0.
As a consequence of continuity, the comultiplication on C is coassociative.
In general, C is not a bialgebra, and C0 is a Hopf *-algebra.
Informally, C can be regarded as the *-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions over the compact matrix quantum group, and u can be regarded as a finite-dimensional representation of the compact matrix quantum group.
A representation of the compact matrix quantum group is given by a corepresentation of the Hopf *-algebra (a corepresentation of a counital coassociative coalgebra A is a square matrix

{\displaystyle \Delta (v_{ij})=\sum _{k=1}^{n}v_{ik}\otimes v_{kj}}

for all i, j and ε(vij) = δij for all i, j). Furthermore, a representation v, is called unitary if the matrix for v is unitary (or equivalently, if κ(vij) = v*ij for all i, j).
An example of a compact matrix quantum group is SUμ(2), where the parameter μ is a positive real number. So SUμ(2) = (C(SUμ(2)), u), where C(SUμ(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by α and γ, subject to

When μ = 1, then SUμ(2) is equal to the algebra C(SU(2)) of functions on the concrete compact group SU(2).
