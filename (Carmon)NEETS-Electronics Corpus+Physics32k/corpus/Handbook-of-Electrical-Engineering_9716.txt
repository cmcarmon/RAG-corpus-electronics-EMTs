p  for  this  device,  operating  in  the  speciﬁed  environment,  is  estimated  to  be  1.32
failures  per  106  hours.  To  calculate  the  predicted  failure  rate  for  a  system  based  around  this  microprocessor
would involve similar calculations for all the parts, including the passive components, the PCB, and connectors,
and  multiplying  all  the  resultant  failure  rates  together.  The  resulting  ﬁgure  could  then  be  inverted  to  give  a
predicted MTTF. This kind of calculation is repetitive, tedious, and therefore prone to errors, so many companies
now provide software to perform the calculations. The ofﬁcial Department of Defense program for automating
the calculation of reliability ﬁgures is called ORACLE. It is regularly updated to include all the changes since
MIL-HDBK-217E was released. Versions for VAX/VMS and the IBM PC are available from the Rome Air Defense
Center, RBET, Grifﬁss Air Force Base, NY 13441-5700. Other software to perform the same function is advertised
in the publications listed under Further Information.
