 To increase the property of inductance, the conductor can be formed into a loop or coil. A coil is also 
called an inductor. Figure 2-3 shows a conductor formed into a coil. Current through one loop produces a 
magnetic field that encircles the loop in the direction as shown in figure 2-3(A). As current increases, the 
magnetic field expands and cuts all the loops as shown in figure 2-3(B). The current in each loop affects 
all other loops. The field cutting the other loop has the effect of increasing the opposition to a current 
change.
