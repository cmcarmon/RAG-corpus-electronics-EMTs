Weight is the downward force that the lift must overcome to produce upward movement. On earth, weight is fairly easy to calculate:




W
e
i
g
h
t

m

g


{\displaystyle Weight=m*g}

In this equation, m represents the mass of the object and g is the acceleration that is produced by gravity. On earth, this value is approximately 9.8 m/s squared. When the force for lift is greater than the force of weight, the aircraft accelerates upwards.
