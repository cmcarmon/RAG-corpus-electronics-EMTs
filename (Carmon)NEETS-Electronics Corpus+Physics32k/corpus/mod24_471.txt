Overfilling the fiber excites both low-order and high-order modes. Figure 5-3 illustrates an overfilled
launch condition. An overfilled launch condition occurs when the launch spot size and angular
distribution are larger than that of the fiber core. Incident light that falls outside the fiber core is lost. In
addition, light that is incident at angles greater than the angle of acceptance of the fiber core is lost.
