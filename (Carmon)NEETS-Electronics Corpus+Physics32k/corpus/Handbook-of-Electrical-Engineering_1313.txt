have acceptable performance degradation for several synchronous or asynchronous tandem connections, and
pass  some  voiceband  modem  signals.  Other  applications  may  have  different  criteria.  Digital  cellular  mobile
radio in the U.S. has no low delay or voiceband modem signal requirements, but the speech data rates required
are under 8 kbits/s and the transmission medium (or channel) can be very noisy and have relatively long fades.
These considerations affect the speech coder chosen for a particular application.
