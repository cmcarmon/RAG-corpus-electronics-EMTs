The amplitude of returned signals received by each horn is continuously compared with those
received in the other horns. Error signals are generated which indicate the relative position of the target
with respect to the axis of the beam. Angle servo circuits receive these error signals and correct the
position of the radar beam to keep the beam axis on target.
