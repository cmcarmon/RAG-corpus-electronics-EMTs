5. Lagrangian interpolation.  Lagrangian  interpolation  is  a  topic  familiar  in  numerical  analysis. An  Nth
order polynomial is ﬁt to  N + 1 arbitrarily spaced sample points. If an inﬁnite number of samples are
equally spaced, then Lagrangian interpolation is equivalent to the cardinal series.
