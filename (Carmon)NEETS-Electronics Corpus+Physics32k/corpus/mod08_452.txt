earlier in figure 3-34, a saturable-core reactor has an ideal operating point. Some d.c. must always be
applied to bring the saturable core to that operating point. This d.c. is called BIAS. the most effective way
to apply bias to the saturable core and also allow a.c. input signals to control the magnetic amplifier is to
use a bias winding. A full-wave magnetic amplifier with a bias winding is shown in figure 3-40.
