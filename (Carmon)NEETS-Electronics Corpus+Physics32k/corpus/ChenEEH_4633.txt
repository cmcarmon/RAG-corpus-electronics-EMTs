The difﬁculties associated with applying the gain-scheduling
techniques just described stem from the local nature of the
results and the lack of formal methods for deriving the sched-
uling law. These difﬁculties manifest themselves in increased
simulation, test, and redesign. For the so-called linear param-
eter varying plants, these difﬁculties can be alleviated. For
linear parameter varying plants, modern linear robust control
techniques can be applied to the design of a gain-scheduled
controller without the need for ad hoc interpolation methods.
