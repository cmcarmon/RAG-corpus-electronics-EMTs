Power Angle and Other Performance Characteristics
The real and reactive power delivered by a synchronous generator, or received by a synchronous
motor, can be expressed in terms of the terminal voltage Vt, the generated voltage Ef, the
synchronous impedance Zs, and the power angle or torque angle δ. Referring to Figure 13.3.2,
it is convenient to adopt a convention that makes positive the real power P and the reactive
power Q delivered by an overexcited generator. Accordingly, the generator action corresponds
to positive values of δ, whereas the motor action corresponds to negative values of δ. With
the adopted notation it follows that P > 0 for generator operation, whereas P < 0 for motor
operation. Further, positive Q means delivering inductive VARs for a generator action, or receiving
inductive VARs for a motor action; negative Q means delivering capacitive VARs for a generator
action, or receiving capacitive VARs for a motor action. It can be observed from Figure 13.3.2
that the power factor is lagging when P and Q have the same sign, and leading when P and Q
have opposite signs.
