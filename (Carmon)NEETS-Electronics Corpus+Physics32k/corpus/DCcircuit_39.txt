The result of an imbalance of this ”ﬂuid” (electrons) between objects is called static electric-
ity. It is called ”static” because the displaced electrons tend to remain stationary after being
moved from one insulating material to another. In the case of wax and wool, it was determined
through further experimentation that electrons in the wool actually transferred to the atoms in
the wax, which is exactly opposite of Franklin’s conjecture! In honor of Franklin’s designation
of the wax’s charge being ”negative” and the wool’s charge being ”positive,” electrons are said
to have a ”negative” charging inﬂuence. Thus, an object whose atoms have received a surplus
of electrons is said to be negatively charged, while an object whose atoms are lacking electrons
is said to be positively charged, as confusing as these designations may seem. By the time the
true nature of electric ”ﬂuid” was discovered, Franklin’s nomenclature of electric charge was
too well established to be easily changed, and so it remains to this day.
