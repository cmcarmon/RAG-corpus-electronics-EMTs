Evidently, a variety of transfer functions can be realized by
choice of the components, the coefﬁcients a and b, and the
values and signs of the transconductances, gmi. For instance,
comparing equation 4.37 with T2 in equation 4.12 shows that
the second-order functions can be realized with arbitrary coef-
ﬁcients. Negative values of gmi are obtained by simply inverting
the polarity of their input connections; this must be done with
caution, of course, to make certain that the transfer functions’
denominator coefﬁcients stay positive.
