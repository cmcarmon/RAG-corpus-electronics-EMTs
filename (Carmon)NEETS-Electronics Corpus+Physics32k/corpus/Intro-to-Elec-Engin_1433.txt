There are several different methods for generating amplitude-modulated signals. Since the
process of modulation involves the generation of new frequency components, modulators are
generally characterized as nonlinear and/or time-variant systems, because a linear or a time-
invariant system cannot create new frequencies other than those contained in its input signal.
Figure 15.2.3 shows a block diagram of power-law modulation that is nonlinear. Let the voltage
input to such a device be the sum of the message signal and the carrier, as illustrated in
Figure 15.2.3. The nonlinear device (that has an input–output characteristic of the form of
a square law) will generate a product of the message x(t) with the carrier, plus additional
terms. The desired modulated signal can be ﬁltered out by passing the output of the nonlinear
device through a bandpass ﬁlter. The signal generated by this method is a conventional DSB
AM signal.
