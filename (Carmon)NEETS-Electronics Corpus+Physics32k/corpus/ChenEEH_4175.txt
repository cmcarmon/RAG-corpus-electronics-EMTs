. Single parity checking: This scheme appends a parity bit
to the character to be transmitted to make the total
number of binary ones in one character be either odd
or even. An odd parity checking or an even parity
checking has to be agreed between a transmitter and
receiver. The problem of this approach is that the even
number of bits changed will make the number of ones
for being odd or even, and the parity bit error cannot
be detected.
