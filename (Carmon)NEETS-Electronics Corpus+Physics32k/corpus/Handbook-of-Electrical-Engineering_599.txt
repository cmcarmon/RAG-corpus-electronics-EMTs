An  approach  based  on  the  harmonic  balance  technique  available  in  the  simulation  program  SPECTRE  is
applicable to both large and small levels of distortion. The program determines the periodic steady state of a
circuit with a sinusoidal input. The unknowns are the magnitudes of the circuit variables at the fundamental
frequency and at all the signiÔ¨Åcant harmonics of the fundamental. The distortion levels can be simply calculated
by taking the ratios of the magnitudes of the appropriate harmonics to the fundamental.
