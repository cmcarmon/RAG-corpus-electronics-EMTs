In Figure 13.23, we have plotted the magnitude functions both ways. In
other words, for the abscissa, we plot both log ω on a linear scale and ω
on a logarithmic scale. For the ordinate, R, ωL, and 1/ωC are also plotted
both ways. In the future, we will choose to plot x on a logarithmic scale.7
On the phase plot, the horizontal scale is logarithmic, and the vertical
scale is linear.
