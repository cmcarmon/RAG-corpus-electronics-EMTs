Intellectual leverage is limited to control ﬂow encapsulation in most procedural languages. Only the execution
paths  through  the  program  are  hidden  in  lower  levels.  While  this  is  an  improvement  over  machine-level
languages, it does not permit much ﬂexibility. For example, algorithmic abstraction is not powerful enough to
easily  express  non-numerical  ideas.  Thus,  a  C  program  is  not  able  to  easily  model  an  electronic  circuit  as  a
diagram or object that can be reasoned about, symbolically.
