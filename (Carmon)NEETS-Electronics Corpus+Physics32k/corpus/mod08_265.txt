Figure 2-20 is a typical rf amplifier used in a vhf television receiver. The input-signal-developing
circuit for this amplifier is made up of L1, C1, and C2. The inductor tunes the input-signal-developing
circuit for the proper TV channel. (L1 can be switched out of the circuit and another inductor switched in
to the circuit by the channel selector.) R1 provides proper bias to Q1 from the base supply voltage (VBB).
Q1 is the transistor. Notice that the case of Q1 (the dotted circle around the transistor symbol) is shown to
be grounded. The case must be grounded because of the high frequencies (54 MHz - 217 MHz) used by
the circuit. R2 provides proper bias from the emitter of Q1, and C3 is used to bypass R2. C5 and L2 are a
parallel LC circuit which acts as the load for Q1. The LC circuit is tuned by L2 which is switched in to
and out of the LC circuit by the channel selector. L3 and C6 are a parallel LC circuit which develops the
signal for the next stage. The parallel LC circuit is tuned by L3 which is switched in to and out of the LC
circuit by the channel selector along with L1 and L2. (L1, L2, and L3 are actually part of a bank of
inductors. L1, L2, and L3 are in the circuit when the channel selector is on channel 2. For other channels,
another group of three inductors would be used in the circuit.) R3 develops a signal which is fed through
C4 to provide neutralization. This counteracts the effects of the interelectrode capacitance from the base
to the collector of Q1. C7 is used to isolate the rf signal from the collector power supply (VCC).
