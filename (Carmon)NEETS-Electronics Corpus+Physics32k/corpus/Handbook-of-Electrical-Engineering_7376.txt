If  FM  is  used  in  the  subcarrier  of  the  transmitter,  the  transducer  signal  modulates  the  frequency  of  the
subcarrier oscillator. This can be done by a simple resonant circuit that produces a given frequency in the audio
range,  say  1,000  Hz,  which  is  varied  above  or  below  by  the  signal  from  the  transducer  as  it  responds  to  the
variable it is measuring. If the signal were fed to a loudspeaker, a rising or falling tone would be heard. The
subcarrier  oscillator  then  modulates  a  radio  frequency  carrier,  varying  its  frequency  (FM)  or  its  amplitude
(AM) in accordance with the subcarrier signal. The radio frequency in FM industrial radio telemetry links is
usually in the 88- to 108-MHz band. At the receiving end of the link, the radio receiver demodulates the signal,
removing the carrier and feeding the subcarrier to a special discriminator circuit that removes the modulation
and precisely reproduces the original measurement signal for calibrated indication or recording.
