The transmitter generates powerful pulses of electromagnetic energy at precise intervals. The
required power is obtained by using a high-power microwave oscillator, such as a magnetron, or a
microwave amplifier, such as a klystron, that is supplied by a low-power rf source. (The construction and
operation of microwave components can be reviewed in NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles.) The
high-power generator, whether an oscillator or amplifier, requires operating power in the form of a
properly-timed, high-amplitude, rectangular pulse. This pulse is supplied by a transmitter unit called the
MODULATOR. When a high-power oscillator is used, the modulator high-voltage pulse switches the
oscillator on and off to supply high-power electromagnetic energy. When a microwave power amplifier is
used, the modulator pulse activates the amplifier just before the arrival of an electromagnetic pulse from a
preceding stage or a frequency-generation source. Normally, because of the extremely high voltage
involved, the modulator pulse is supplied to the cathode of the power tube and the plate is at ground
potential to shield personnel from shock hazards. The modulator pulse may be more than 100,000 volts in
high-power radar transmitters. In any case, radar transmitters produce voltages, currents, and radiation
hazards that are extremely dangerous to personnel. Safety precautions must always be strictly observed
when working in or around a radar transmitter.
