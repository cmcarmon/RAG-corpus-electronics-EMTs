This chapter was devoted to the fundamentals of frequency-
domain analysis of transmission lines with an emphasis on
physical concepts rather than detailed mathematical deriv-
ations. A distributed circuit model was employed to derive the
transmission line equations, whose solution describes the wave
behavior of voltages and currents along the line. Initially, we
considered an inﬁnite line to emphasize the concepts of phase
delay and spatial dependence, which account for the distributed
nature of voltages and currents along a transmission line. The
propagation characteristics of lossless and lossy lines were dis-
cussed, with the latter specialized to low-loss and distortionless
cases. Properties of the standing waves along a terminated
transmission line, such as impedance, reﬂection coefﬁcient,
voltage and current distribution, were discussed in detail. Math-
ematical expressions were derived for power ﬂow, including
