l is the wavelength at the highest frequency of interest; DL is the spatial resolution being sought; L is object maximum
object dimension or dimension in observation plane; d is the number of spatial dimensions being sampled and is not
necessarily the problem dimensionality D. The distinction is important because when an appropriate Green’s function is
available, the source integrals are usually one dimension less than the problem dimension, i.e., d = D – 1. An exception
is an inhomogeneous, penetrable body where d = D when using an integral equation.
