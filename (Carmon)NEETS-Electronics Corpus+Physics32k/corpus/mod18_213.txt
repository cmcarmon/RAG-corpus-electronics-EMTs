Timing or control is the function of the majority of circuits in radar. Circuits in a radar set
accomplish control and timing functions by producing a variety of voltage waveforms, such as square
waves, sawtooth waves, trapezoidal waves, rectangular waves, brief rectangular pulses, and sharp peaks.
Although all of these circuits can be broadly classified as timing circuits, the specific function of any
individual circuit could also be wave shaping or wave generation. The operation of many of these circuits
and associated terms were described in detail in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and
Wave-Shaping Circuits.
