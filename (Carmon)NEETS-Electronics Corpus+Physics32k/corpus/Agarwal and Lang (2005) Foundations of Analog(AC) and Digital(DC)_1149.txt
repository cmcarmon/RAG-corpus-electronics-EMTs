We must assume, of course, that the circuit is biased properly. As depicted in
Figure 8.21, we compute the output resistance by applying a small test voltage
vtest at the output and measuring the corresponding current itest. As before,
all other independent small-signal voltages or DC voltage sources are shorted.
Thus the small-signal input voltage vi is set to 0. Similarly, all other independent
small-signal or DC current sources are turned into open circuits.
