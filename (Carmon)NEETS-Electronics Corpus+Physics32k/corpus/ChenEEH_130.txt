The nonlinear equation 3.7 is solved numerically using an
iterative method called the Newton–Raphson (NR) method.
Let v0 denote the initial guess and vi the result of the ith
iteration for the solution of equation 3.7. The calculation of
the next iteration value viþ1 is attempted such that x(viþ1)  0.
Expanding x(viþ1) in a Taylor series around the point vi gives
Equation 3.8.
