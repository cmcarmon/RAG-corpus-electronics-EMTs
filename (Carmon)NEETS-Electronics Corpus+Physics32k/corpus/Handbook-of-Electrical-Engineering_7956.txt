A sequencer such as that shown above allows the direct implementation of a synchronous ﬁnite state machine
with  both  Moore-type  (PSb)  or  the  Mealy-type  outputs  (Oa¢,  Ob).  The  transitions  between  states  in  the
behavioral speciﬁcation of the state machine map directly into the product terms of the sequencer.
