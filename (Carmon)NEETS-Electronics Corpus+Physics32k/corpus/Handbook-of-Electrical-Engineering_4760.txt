It  is  possible  to  obtain  larger  displacements  with  mechanisms  which  exhibit  mechanical  gain,  such  as
laminated strips (similar to bimetallic strips). The motion then is typically up to about 1 millimeter but at a
cost  of  a  reduced  available  force. An  example  of  such  an  application  is  the  video  head  translating  device  to
provide tracking in VCRs.
