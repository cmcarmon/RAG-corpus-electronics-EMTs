2. The contact resistance (resistance between the blades of the switch when they are in contact) is in
series with the shunt, but not with the meter coil. In shunts that must pass high currents, this
contact resistance becomes an appreciable part of the total shunt resistance. Because the contact
resistance is of a variable nature, the ammeter indication may not be accurate.
