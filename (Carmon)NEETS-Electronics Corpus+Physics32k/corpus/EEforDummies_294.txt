V represents the voltage (in volts, abbreviated V) measured across the resisÂ­
tor and I represents the current (in amps, abbreviated A) flowing through the 
resistor. For example, suppose the voltage is 5 V and you want to pass 25 mA 
(milliamps) of current through the resistor. To calculate the power, first you 
convert 25 mA to 0.025 A (remember, milliamps are thousandths of an amp). 
Then you multiply 5 by 0.025, and you get 0.125 W, or 1/8 W. So you know 
that a 1/8 W resistor may be okay, but you can be sure that a 1/4 W resistor 
will take the heat just fine in your circuit.
