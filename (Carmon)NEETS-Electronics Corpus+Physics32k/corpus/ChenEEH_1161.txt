Traditionally, area minimization and speed maximization were
the only axes with respect to which a design’s effectiveness was
measured. Low-power, high-throughput, and computationally
intensive circuits are critical application domains (Rabaey and
Pedram, 1996). In addition to these three design parameters,
area, speed, and power, there are two design metrics that have
been of great importance to current designs. These metrics are
noise and reliability. The ﬁve metrics are shown in Figure 7.1
with an arrow associated with each to show whether the
particular metric should be increased or decreased.
