Notice that under quiescent conditions, the voltage drop at the top of Rk is +10 volts. Now letâ€™s apply
the positive-going signal illustrated to the left of the tube. When the positive signal is applied, conduction
through the tube will increase. The only trouble is that current through Rk will also increase. This will
increase the voltage drop across Rk, and the cathode voltage will now be greater than +10 volts.
Remember, at this time the plate is going negative due to increased conduction through the tube. The
combination of the negative-going plate and the positive-going cathode will decrease the electrostatic
attraction across the tube and lower the conduction of the tube. This will reduce the gain of the tube.
