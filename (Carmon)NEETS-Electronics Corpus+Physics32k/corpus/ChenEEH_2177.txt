In many applications of permanent magnets—such as in
electrical motors, generators, and relays—the permanent
magnet is part of a magnetic circuit containing an air gap. In
these situations, as derived in example, 1.12, the permanent
magnet generally operates in the second (or fourth) quadrant
of the hysteresis curve (Bozorth, 1978). This second-quadrant
portion of the hysteresis curve is called the demagnetization
curve and is illustrated in Figure 1.7.
