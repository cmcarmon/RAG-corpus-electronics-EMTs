To reduce the number of errors, you will want to carefully check the coding sheets before they are 
keyed into the computer. This process is known as "desk-checking" and should include an examination 
for program completeness. Typical input data should be manually traced through the program processing 
paths to identify possible errors. In effect, you will be attempting to play the role of the computer. After 
you have desk checked the program for accuracy, the program is ready to be assembled or compiled. 
Assembly and compiler programs prepare your program (source program) to be executed by the 
computer, and they have error diagnostic features which detect certain types of mistakes in your program. 
These mistakes must be corrected. Even when an error-free pass of the program through the assembly or 
compiler program is accomplished, this does not mean your program is perfected. However, it usually 
means the program is ready for testing.
