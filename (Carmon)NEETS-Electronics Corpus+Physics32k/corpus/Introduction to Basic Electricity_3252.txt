The size of the depletion region is controlled by 
EGS. As EGS increases, so does the depletion region. 
A  decrease in EGS causes a decrease in the  depletion 
region.  When  the  depletion  region  increases,  it 
 effectively reduces the size of the channel, which in 
turn reduces the amount of current that is able to 
flow through it. EGS can thus be used to control the 
drain current (ID) that flows through the channel. An 
 increase in EGS causes a decrease in ID.
