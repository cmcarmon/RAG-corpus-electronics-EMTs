As networks face increasing bandwidth demand and diminish-
ing Ô¨Åber availability, network providers are moving toward a
crucial milestone in network evolution: the optical network.
Optical networks, based on the emergence of the optical layer
in transport networks, provide higher capacity and reduced
costs for new applications such as the Internet, video and
multimedia interaction, and advanced digital services.
