Modes in Step-Index Fibers
Derivation of the exact modal ﬁeld relations for optical ﬁbers is complex. Fortunately, ﬁbers used in optical
communication  satisfy  the  weekly  guiding  approximation  in  which  the  relative  index  difference, (cid:209),  is  much
less than unity. In this approximation, application of the requirement for continuity of transverse and tangential
electric ﬁeld components at the core-cladding interface (at r = a) to Eqs. (42.18a) and (42.18b) results in the
following eigenvalue equation [Snyder, 1969]:
