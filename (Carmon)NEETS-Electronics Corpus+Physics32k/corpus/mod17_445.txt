Most unprotected shipboard receivers are susceptible to emi over a frequency range much wider than 
their normal bandpass. Off-frequency rejection rarely excludes strong, adjacent-channel signals. These 
signals enter the receiver and degrade receiver performance by being processed along with the desired, 
tuned signal. Usually, the presence of emi will be apparent to you. It has a bad effect. Upon the desired 
signal quality, such as that in CROSS-MODULATION where a spurious response occurs when the carrier
