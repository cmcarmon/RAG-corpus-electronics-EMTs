device. After specifying all the materials properties to be used
and the processing steps to be followed, the designer then
has to decide on the dimensions of the design so that the
optimal device dimensions will yield the maximum perform-
ance. The dimensions of the device have to be compatible with
the process steps and also with the general design rules of the
particular technology.
