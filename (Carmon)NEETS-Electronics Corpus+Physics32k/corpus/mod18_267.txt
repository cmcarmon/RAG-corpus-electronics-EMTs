During discharge of the storage element, the gas in the thyratron tube is highly ionized. While the
storage element discharges, the plate-to-cathode resistance of the thyratron is practically zero. When the
storage element is completely discharged, current ceases to flow through the thyratron and the gases
become deionized; the negative grid bias regains control, and the thyratron is cut off (the modulator
switch opens).
