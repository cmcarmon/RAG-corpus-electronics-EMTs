Many physical properties follow directly from the Drude model as some equations do not depend on the statistical distribution of the particles. Taking the classical velocity distribution of an ideal gas or the velocity distribution of a Fermi gas only changes the results related to the speed of the electrons.
Mainly, the free electron model and the Drude model predict the same DC electrical conductivity for Ohm's law, that is




σ
=



n

e

τ


m

e




,


{\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {ne^{2}\tau }{m_{e}}},}

where



n


{\displaystyle n}
is the electronic density (number of electrons/volume), where



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the electron electric charge, and




m

e




{\displaystyle m_{e}}
is the electron mass.
Other quantities that remain the same under the free electron model as under Drude's are the AC susceptibility, the plasma frequency, the magnetoresistance, and the Hall coefficient related to the Hall effect.
