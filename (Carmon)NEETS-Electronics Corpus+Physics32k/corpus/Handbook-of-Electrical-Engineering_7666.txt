Dynamic RAMs (DRAMs)
The universally used storage cell circuit of one transistor and
one capacitor has remained unchanged for over 20 years. The
physical  implementation,  however,  has  undergone  much
diversity  and  many  reﬁnements.  The  innovation  in  physical
implementation is driven primarily by the need to maintain
a nearly constant value of capacitance while the surface area
of the cell has decreased. A nearly ﬁxed value of capacitance
is needed to meet two important design goals. The cell has no
internal ampliﬁcation. Once the information is accessed, the
stored voltage is vastly attenuated by the much larger bit line
capacitance (see Fig. 80.1). The resulting signal must be kept
larger  than  the  resolution  limits  of  the  sensing  ampliﬁer.
DRAMs in particular are also sensitive to a problem called soft
errors. These are typically initiated by atomic events such as
the incidence of a single alpha particle. An alpha particle can
cause a spurious signal of 50,000 electrons or more. All mod-
ern DRAM designs resolve this problem by constructing the
capacitor  in  space  out  of  the  plane  of  the  transistors  (see
Fig. 80.2  for  examples).  Placing  the  capacitor  in  space  unusable  for  transistor  fabrication  has  allowed  great
strides in DRAM density, generally at the expense of fabrication complexity. DRAM chip capacity has increased
by about a factor of four every three years.
