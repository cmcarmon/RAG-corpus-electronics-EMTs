Clearly, the positive-semideﬁnite Toeplitz matrix approximation Xdyk lies slightly closer to X in the Frobenius norm
sense than does Xssp. Convergence was deemed to have occurred when the normed matrix error ** Xn – X ** /** X **
became  less  than  10–9.  The  successive  projection  algorithms  and  Dykstra’s  algorithm  took  two  and  three
iterations, respectively, to reach this normed error level.
