Another type of special-purpose tube is the MULTI-ELECTRODE tube. In some applications,
tubes require more than the three grids found in conventional tubes. In some cases, up to seven grids may
be used. These types of tubes are called multi-electrode tubes and are normally classified according to the
number of grids they contain. An example of this is illustrated in figure 2-3. Here, you see a tube with
five grids; hence, its name is "pentagrid." The application of these tube types is beyond the scope of this
module, but because multi-electrode tubes have been commonly used you should be aware of their
existence.
