A result is shown in Figure 11.7 The initial transient re-
sponse was omitted so as not to obscure the effect of the higher
order controller. The response of the closed-loop system,
meaning the position of the ﬁrst ﬂoor, x1, is shown for the
linear controller design and the third-order controller design.
Note that the magnitude of the oscillations in the response as
the output tends toward the commanded position are much
smaller for the third-order design when compared to those
produced by the linear controller design.
