This invisible field of force is commonly represented by lines that are drawn to show the paths along
which the force acts. The lines representing the electric field are drawn in the direction that a single
positive charge would normally move under the influence of that field. A large electric force is shown by
a large concentration of lines; a weak force is indicated by a few lines.
