MAGNETRON OSCILLATORS are capable of generating rf pulses with very high peak power at
frequencies ranging from 600 to 30,000 megahertz. However, if its cathode voltage changes, the
magnetron oscillator shifts in frequency. To avoid such a frequency change, you must ensure that the
amplitude of the modulator (dc) pulse remains constant for the duration of the transmitted rf pulse. That
is, the modulator pulse must have a flat top. The range of cathode voltages over which a magnetron
oscillates in the desired frequency spectrum is relatively small.
