The sputtering process subjects a gas-filled cham-
ber to a high voltage. The high voltage ionizes the gas, 
and the material to be deposited is bombarded with 
ions. This dislodges the atoms within the  material, 
which drift toward the substrate, where they are 
 deposited as a thin film. A mask is used to ensure 
proper location of the film deposit. Another method 
is to coat the substrate completely and cut or etch away 
the undesired portions.
