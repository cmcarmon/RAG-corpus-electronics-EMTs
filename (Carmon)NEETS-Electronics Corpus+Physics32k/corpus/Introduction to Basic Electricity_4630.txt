a comparator for checking two 2-bit numbers. If the 
numbers are equal, a 1 is generated from the XNOR 
gate. The 1 is applied to the AND gate as a qualifying 
level. If both XNOR gates produce a 1 for the inputs to 
the AND gate, that identifies the numbers as equal and 
generates a 1 for the output of the AND gate. However, 
if the inputs to the XNOR gate are different, the XNOR 
gate generates a 0, which disqualifies the AND gate. 
The output of the AND gate is then a 0. Figure 45-32 
shows a logic diagram of a comparator for checking 
two 4-bit numbers. Figure 45-33 is the diagram used 
to represent a 4-bit comparator.
