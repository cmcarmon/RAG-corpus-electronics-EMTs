The two splitting branch lines of the strip-line equal-power
Wilkinson divider/combiner have the characteristic imped-
ances of
Z0, which is obtained from the input-matching
2
requirement (characteristic impedance Â¼ Z0 of the three ex-
ternal ports is assumed). The resistor of isolation is 2Z0. A
Wilkinson divider may offer a bandwidth of about one octave,
which can be further improved by using a cascaded multi-
section topology.
