The voltage dropped across the resistor in a circuit consisting of a single resistor and a voltage
source is the total voltage across the circuit and is equal to the applied voltage. The total voltage across a
series circuit that consists of more than one resistor is also equal to the applied voltage, but consists of the
sum of the individual resistor voltage drops. In any series circuit, the SUM of the resistor voltage drops
must equal the source voltage. This statement can be proven by an examination of the circuit shown in
figure 3-17. In this circuit a source potential (ET) of 20 volts is dropped across a series circuit consisting
of two 5-ohm resistors. The total resistance of the circuit (RT) is equal to the sum of the two individual
resistances, or 10 ohms. Using Ohmâ€™s law the circuit current may be calculated as follows:
