from the following theorems which are stated without proof [Chan, 1969].
Theorem 3.1. Let  N  be  a  passive  network  without  mutual  inductances.  The  determinant  D  of  the  node
admittance matrix Yn is equal to the sum of all tree-admittances of N, where a tree-admittance product t (i)(y)
is deÔ¨Åned to be the product of the admittance of all the branches of the tree T (i). That is,
