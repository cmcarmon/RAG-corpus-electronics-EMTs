which  can  be  solved  to  obtain  the  mesh  currents 
and  We  are  at
liberty  to  use  any  technique  for  solving  the  simultaneous  equations.
According to Eq. (2.12), if a circuit has n nodes, b branches, and l inde-
pendent  loops  or  meshes,  then 
Hence,  l independent
simultaneous  equations  are  required  to  solve  the  circuit  using  mesh
analysis.
