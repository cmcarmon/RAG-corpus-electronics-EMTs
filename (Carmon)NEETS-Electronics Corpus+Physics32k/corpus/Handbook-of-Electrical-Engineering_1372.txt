Models and Performance Measures
The goals of speech enhancement as stated in the ﬁrst section are to improve perceptual aspects of the noisy
signal  whether  the  signal  is  transmitted  through  analog  or  digital  channels  and  to  reduce  the  error  rate  in
recognizing  noisy  speech  signals.  Improving  perceptual  aspects  of  the  noisy  signal  can  be  accomplished  by
estimating the clean signal from the noisy signal using perceptually meaningful estimation performance mea-
sures. If the signal has to be encoded for transmission over digital channels, then source coding techniques can
be applied to the given noisy signal. In this case, a perceptually meaningful ﬁdelity measure between the clean
signal and the encoded noisy signal must be used. Reducing error rate in speech communication systems can
be accomplished by applying optimal signal classiﬁcation approaches to the given noisy signals. Thus the speech
enhancement problem is essentially a set of signal estimation, source coding, and signal classiﬁcation problems.
The  probabilistic  approach  for  solving  these  problems  requires  explicit  knowledge  of  the  performance
measure as well as the probability laws of the clean signal and noise process. Such knowledge, however, is not
explicitly  available.  Hence,  mathematically  tractable  performance  measures  and  statistical  models  which  are
believed to be meaningful are used. In this section we brieﬂy review the most commonly used statistical models
and performance measures.
