identical paraboloidal antennas with pencil beam-
width of 1°, aperture efﬁciency of 0.8, and radi-
ation efﬁciency of 0.85. The transmitting station
has Pt = 60 W and Lt = 2 at 8 GHz. With Lr = 1.5
and Lch = 2.5, ﬁnd the diameter of the antennas and
the signal power available at the receiver input.
