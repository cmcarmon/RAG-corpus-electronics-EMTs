Almost all generators turn mechanical power into electrical
power through a 60-Hz synchronously rotating machine. The
only exceptions are the new generators that convert solar,
wind, or chemical power into electrical energy, but the amount
of generation available in these modes is yet a small fraction;
however, any nonsynchronous generator has to be connected
to the grid through interfacing equipment that converts to
60 Hz.
