In this expression the measurement signal x is assumed to lie in eC m, H is a known matrix contained in C m ·  n
of full rank n, and w ˛  C m is an unobserved noise vector. It is now desired to ﬁnd a vector of form y = Ha
that best approximates the measurement x in the sense of minimizing the quadratic criterion
