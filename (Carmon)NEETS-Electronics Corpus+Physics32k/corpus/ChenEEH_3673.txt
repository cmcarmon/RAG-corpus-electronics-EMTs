where To represents an overall gain term and rk the (generally
complex) pole locations for the model. Based on our know-
ledge of phonetics, we might suspect that the model is inad-
equate for certain classes of phonemes. We have noted that
some phonemes (e.g.,
the nasals) exhibit spectral nulls,
strongly suggesting the need for zeros in the model. We will
return to the issue of zeros in the model below. A strong
impetus to justify an all-pole model
is the availability of
powerful analytical methods that follow from its use.
Each pair of poles in the z-plane at complex conjugate
locations (ri, r
i ) roughly corresponds to a formant in the
spectrum of T(z). Since the T(z) should be a stable system,
all poles are inside the unit circle in the z-plane. If the poles in
the z-plane are well-separated, estimates for formant frequen-
cies and bandwidths can be obtained from the pole locations.
