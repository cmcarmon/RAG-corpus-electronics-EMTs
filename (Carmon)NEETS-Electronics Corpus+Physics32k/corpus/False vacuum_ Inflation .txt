It would also have implications for other aspects of physics, and would suggest that the Higgs self-coupling λ and its βλ function could be very close to zero at the Planck scale, with "intriguing" implications, including for theories of gravity and Higgs-based inflation. A future electron-positron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations.
