In Newtonian gravity, a particle of mass M creates a gravitational field

{\displaystyle {\vec {g}}={\frac {-GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {r}}}
, where the radial unit vector

{\displaystyle {\hat {r}}}
points away from the particle. The gravitational force experienced by a particle of mass m is given by

An electric field






E

{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}
is a vector field. It exerts a force on a point charge q given by






F

q



E
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=q{\vec {E}}}
.
a gravitational force field is a model used to explain the influence that a massive body extends into the space around itself, producing a force on another massive body.,
