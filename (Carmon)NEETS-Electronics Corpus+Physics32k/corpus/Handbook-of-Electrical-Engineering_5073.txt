Biological  measurands  are  biologically  produced  substances,  such  as  antibodies,  glucose,  hormones,  and
enzymes. Biosensors are not the same as biomedical sensors, which are any sensors used in biomedical appli-
cations,  such  as  blood  pressure  sensors,  or  electrocardiogram  electrodes.  Many  biosensors  are  biomedical
sensors; however, they are also used in industrial applications, e.g., the monitoring and control of fermentation
reactions. Table 56.1 does not include biological signals as a primary signal because they can be classiﬁed as
either chemical or physical in nature. Biosensors are of special interest because of the very high selectivity of
biological  reactions  and  binding.  However,  the  detection  of  that  reaction  or  binding  is  often  elusive. A  very
familiar  commercial  biosensor  is  the  in-home  pregnancy  test  sensor,  which  detects  the  presence  of  human
growth factor in urine. That device is a nonelectrical sensor since the output is a color change which the eye
senses.  In  fact,  most  biosensors  require  multiple  transduction  mechanisms  to  arrive  at  an  electrical  output
signal. Two examples are given below: an immunosensor and an enzyme sensor. Rather than examine a speciﬁc
species, the examples describe a general type of sensor and transduction mechanism, since the same principles
can be applied to a very large number of biological species of the same type.
