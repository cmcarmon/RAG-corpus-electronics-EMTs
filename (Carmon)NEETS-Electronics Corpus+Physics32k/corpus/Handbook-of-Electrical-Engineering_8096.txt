Device Efﬁciency
In considering LED efﬁciencies, it is convenient to consider the emission process to consist of three distinct
steps: (a) excitation, (b) recombination, and (c) extraction. These will be discussed with reference to Fig. 83.4.
p
-type side of the junction are more likely
to be successfully emitted from the surface of the device, for the structure shown in Fig. 83.4(a) and (b) if the
p
I
, made up of electron, hole, and space-
-type region is a thin surface layer. For a given total LED current, 
I
,  respectively,  the  electron  injection  efﬁciency  (which
charge  region  recombination  components, 
r
provides the excitation) is
