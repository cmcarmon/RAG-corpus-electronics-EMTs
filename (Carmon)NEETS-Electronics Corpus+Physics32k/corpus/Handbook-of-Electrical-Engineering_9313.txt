1. A proper computational unit has exactly one entry point and one exit.
2. New computational units are formed from existing units A, B, . . . by  a.sequencing  (perform  A,  then  B,
and so forth) b.selection (perform A or B or . . ., depending on some condition) c.iteration (while some
condition prevails, repeat A).
