Figure 5.17 shows one way to obtain precision rectiﬁcation using an operational ampliﬁer and a diode. The
circuit is essentially a noninverting voltage follower (whose output follows, or duplicates, its input) when the
diode is forward biased. When vin is positive, the output of the ampliﬁer,  vo, is positive, the diode is forward
biased, and a low-resistance path is established between vo and v–, as necessary for a voltage follower. The load
voltage, vL, then follows the positive variations of vin = v+. Note that even a very small positive value of vin will
cause this result, because of the large differential gain of the ampliﬁer. That is, the large gain and the action of
the feedback cause the usual result that v+ ’ v –. Note also that the drop across the diode does not appear in vL.
When the input goes negative, vo becomes negative, and the diode is reverse biased. This effectively opens
the feedback loop, so vL no longer follows vin. The ampliﬁer itself, now operating open-loop, is quickly driven
to its maximum negative output, thus holding the diode well into reverse bias.
