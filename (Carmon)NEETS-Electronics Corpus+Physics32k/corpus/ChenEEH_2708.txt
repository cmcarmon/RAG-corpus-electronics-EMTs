. The location of the ~EE and ~HH components in the Yee
space lattice and the central-different operations
on these components implicitly enforce the two
Gauss’s Law relations (Taﬂove and Hagness, 2000).
Thus, the Yee mesh is divergence-free with respect to
its E and H ﬁelds in the absence of free electric and
magnetic charges.
