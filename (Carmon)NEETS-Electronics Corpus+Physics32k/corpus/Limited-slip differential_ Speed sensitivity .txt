Speed-sensitive differentials limit the torque difference between the outputs, Trq d , based on the difference in speed between the two output shafts. Thus for small output speed differences the differentialâ€™s behavior may be very close to an open differential. As the speed difference increase the limiting torque increases. This results in different dynamic behavior as compared to a torque sensitive differential.
