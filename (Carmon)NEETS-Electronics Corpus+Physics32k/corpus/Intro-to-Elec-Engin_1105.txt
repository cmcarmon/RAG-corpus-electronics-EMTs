then be rotating in the direction opposite that of the rotating mmf, so the machine will act as a
brake and the speed will rapidly come to zero, at which time the electric supply can be removed
from the machine. Such a reversal of two supply lines of the three-phase system, a useful method
of stopping the motor rapidly, is generally referred to as plugging or plug-braking. If the electric
supply is not removed at zero speed, however, the machine will reverse its direction of rotation
because of the change of phase sequence of the supply resulting from the interchange of the two
stator leads. The general form of the torque–speed curve (or torque–slip characteristic) for the
polyphase induction machine between rotor speed limits of −ωs ≤ ωm ≤ 2ωs, corresponding to
a range of slips −1 ≤ S ≤ 2, is shown in Figure 13.1.6.
