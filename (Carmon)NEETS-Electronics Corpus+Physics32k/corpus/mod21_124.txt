Because the operating capabilities and design features of a tube are demonstrated by its electrical
characteristics, a tube is tested by measuring those characteristics and comparing them with representative
values established for that type of tube. Tubes that read abnormally high or low with respect to the
standard are suspect. Practical considerations, which take into account the limitations of the tube test in
predicting actual tube performance in a particular circuit, make it unnecessary to use complex and costly
test equipment with laboratory accuracy. For most applications, testing of a single tube characteristic is
good enough to determine tube performance. Some of the more important factors affecting the life
expectancy of an electron tube are listed below:
