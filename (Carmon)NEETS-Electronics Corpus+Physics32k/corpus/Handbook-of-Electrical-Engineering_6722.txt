Message  switching: A  service-oriented  class  of  communication  in  which  messages  are  exchanged  among
terminating equipments by traversing a set of switching nodes in a store-and-forward manner. This is
analogous to an ordinary postal system. The destination terminal need not be active at the same time as
the originator in order that the message exchange take place.
