Digital Realization
All of the algorithms discussed here are always implemented using digital computers, owing to their superior
accuracy,  ﬂexibility,  and  dynamic  range,  as  compared  to  currently  available  analog  devices.  Generally,  32-bit
or 64-bit ﬂoating point arithmetic is required for most practical applications, although extra precision may be
required for extremely ill-conditioned problems.
