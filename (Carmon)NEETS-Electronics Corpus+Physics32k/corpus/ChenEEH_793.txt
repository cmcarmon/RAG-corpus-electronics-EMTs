The design process for a technical product may, in general, be
roughly subdivided into three main phases: conceptualization,
concept reﬁnement, and implementation. Inputs to the pro-
cess are the design requirements, eventually resulting in
the design results. A more detailed view to this ‘‘black box’’
model of the design process, as depicted in Figure 3.1, results
in an identiﬁcation of a process chain consisting of generat-
ing and analyzing activities to be performed iteratively in
the outlined steps of conceptualization, reﬁnement, and
implementation.
