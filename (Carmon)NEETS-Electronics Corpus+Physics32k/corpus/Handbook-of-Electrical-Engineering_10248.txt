Development  of  an  avionics  system  follows  the  traditional  systems  engineering  ﬂow  from  deﬁnition  and
analysis of the requirements and constraints at increasing level of detail, through detailed design, construction,
validation, 
installation, and maintenance. Like some of the other aerospace electronic systems, avionics operate
in  real  time  and  perform  mission-  and  life-critical  functions.  These  two  aspects  combine  to  make  avionics
system design and
