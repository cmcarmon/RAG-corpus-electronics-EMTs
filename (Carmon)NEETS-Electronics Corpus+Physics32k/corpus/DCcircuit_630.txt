Building a circuit with components secured to a terminal strip isn’t as easy as plugging
components into a breadboard, principally because the components cannot be physically ar-
ranged to resemble the schematic layout. Instead, the builder must understand how to ”bend”
the schematic’s representation into the real-world layout of the strip. Consider one example of
how the same four-resistor circuit could be built on a terminal strip:
