pressure is raised above that at other points in the surrounding medium (air). Because air is elastic, the
disturbance is transmitted in an outward direction as a COMPRESSION WAVE. When the tine returns
and moves in the inward direction, the air in front of the tine is rarefied (made less dense or expanded) so
that its pressure is lowered below that of the other points in the surrounding air. The rarefied wave is
propagated from the tuning fork and follows the compressed wave through the medium (air).
