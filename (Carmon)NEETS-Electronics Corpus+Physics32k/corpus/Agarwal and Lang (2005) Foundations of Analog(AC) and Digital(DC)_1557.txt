b) Now consider Figure 10.105. This figure shows the use of a second buffer with
larger transistors and smaller valued load resistors (x > 1) interposed between the
first buffer and the load capacitor. Compute the propagation delay for the buffer
BUF1 in series with BUF2 driving the load CL for the rising transition at the input
A. Assuming that CL is much larger than the input gate capacitances of the two
buffers, and that x > 1, is the delay computed in part (b) greater than or less than
the delay computed in part (a)?
