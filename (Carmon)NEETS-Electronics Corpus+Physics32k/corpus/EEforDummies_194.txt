Note that the sum of the power consumed by the resistor and the LED 
 mW ) is equal to the power supplied by the battery (13.7 mW).

.
Thatâ€™s because the battery is providing the electrical energy that the resistor 
and the LED are using. (Actually, the resistor is converting electrical energy 
to heat energy, and the LED is converting electrical energy into light energy.)
