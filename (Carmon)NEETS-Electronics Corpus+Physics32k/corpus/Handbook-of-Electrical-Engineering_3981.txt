It  is  common  to  fabricate  microwave  integrated  circuits  using  both  hybrid  and  monolithic  techniques.  In
the hybrid approach, discrete active devices are mounted in RF circuits that can be fabricated from waveguides
or transmission lines fabricated using coaxial, microstrip, stripline, coplanar waveguide, or other such media.
Monolithic  circuits  are  fabricated  with  both  the  active  device  and  the  RF  circuit  fabricated  in  the  same
semiconductor chip. Interconnection lines and the embedding RF circuit are generally fabricated using micros-
trip or coplanar waveguide transmission lines.
