All  exact  methods  known  for  determining  an  optimal  solution  require  a  computing  effort  that  increases
exponentially with number of cells. To overcome this problem, many heuristics have been proposed [Preas and
Lorenzetti, 1988]. There are basically three strategies of heuristics for solving the placement problem, namely,
constructive,  partitioning,  and  iterative  methods.  Constructive  methods  create  placement  in  an  incremental
manner where a complete placement is only available when the method terminates. They often start by placing
a seed (a seed can be a single cell or a group of cells) on the chip and then continuously placing other cells
based on some heuristics such as size of cells, connectivity between the cells, design condition for connection
lengths, or size of chip. This process continues until all the cells are placed on the chip. Partitioning methods
divide the cells into two or more partitions so that the number of connections that cross the partition boundaries
