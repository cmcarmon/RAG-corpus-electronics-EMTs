Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography
In contrast to PET, SPECT can be utilized with any radioisotope that emits gamma rays, including such common
radioisotopes as Tc-99m, I-125, and I-131 which have been utilized in conventional nuclear imaging for the
last 30–35 years and which due to their relatively long half-lives are available at reasonable cost at nearly every
modern hospital. Due to the need for direction sensitivity of the detector, a collimator must be used to eliminate
gamma rays from other than the prescribed direction, thus resulting in a 1–2 order of magnitude decrease in
quantum efﬁciency as compared with PET scanning [Knoll, 1983].
