For cable distribution, many channels are frequency-division multiplexed (FDM), separated nominally by 6
MHz (8 MHz in Europe), over the bandwidth supported by the coaxial cable. A typical 60-channel cable system
operates between 55.25 and 439.25 MHz. Given the large dynamic range required to transmit both the remaining
RF carrier and the low-level sidebands, transmission of this multichannel spectrum is a challenge for lightwave
technology.
