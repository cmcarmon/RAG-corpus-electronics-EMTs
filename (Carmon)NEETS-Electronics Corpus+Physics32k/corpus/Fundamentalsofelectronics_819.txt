The choice of signals to represent bit values is arbitrary to some degree. Clearly, we do not want to
choose signal set members to be the same; we couldn’t distinguish bits if we did so. We could also have
made the negative-amplitude pulse represent a 0 and the positive one a 1. This choice is indeed arbitrary
and will have no eﬀect on performance assuming the receiver knows which signal represents which bit. As
in all communication systems, we design transmitter and receiver together.
