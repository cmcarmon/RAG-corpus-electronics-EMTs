Field-effect transistors (FETs) may be classiﬁed as JFETs (junction ﬁeld-effect transistors), de-
pletion MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistors), and enhancement MOS-
FETs. Each of these classiﬁcations features a semiconductor channel of either n-type or p-type,
whose conduction is controlled by a ﬁeld effect. Consequently, all FETs behave in a similar
fashion. The FET classiﬁcation is illustrated in Figure 7.4.1 along with the corresponding circuit
symbols. FETs have the useful property that very little current ﬂows through their input (gate)
terminals.
