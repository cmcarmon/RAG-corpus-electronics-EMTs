Started with a small trial in 1985 using signed cameras with minimal effect. The major introduction was at the end of 1989 with hidden speed cameras starting at around 500 hours/month increasing to 4000 hours/month by 1992. During the testing of the cameras the percentage of drivers speeding (over the speed camera thresholds) was 24% and by the end of 1992 this had dropped to 4%. The revenue collected by each camera dropped from $2000/hour to $1000/hour over 18 months. The road toll dropped from 776 in 1989 (no cameras) to 396 in 1992 (49% drop).
