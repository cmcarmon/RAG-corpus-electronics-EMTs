Single-sideband modulation is a form of amplitude modulation in which only one sideband is 
transmitted with a suppressed carrier. Since balanced modulators are used to provide carrier cancellation, 
the exact balancing of the carriers to provide cancellation requires a null adjustment. The null can be 
observed and adjusted by using either a detector and an indicator, such as a voltmeter, or an oscilloscope 
for observation of the output while tuning the transmitter.
