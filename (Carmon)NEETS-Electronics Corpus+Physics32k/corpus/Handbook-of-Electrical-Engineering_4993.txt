where E is the applied ﬁeld, T the lattice temperature, Te the electron temperature, and j an energy distribution
constant.  Thus  in  qualitative  terms  as  the  temperature  is  increased  gradually,  the  breakdown  voltage  rises
because the interaction between the electrons and the lattice is enhanced as a result of the increased thermal
vibrations of the lattice. Ultimately, a critical temperature is attained where the electron–electron interactions
surpass in importance those between the electrons and the lattice, and the breakdown strength commences a
monotonic decline with temperature; this behavior is borne out in NaCl crystals, as is apparent from Fig. 55.5
[von Hippel and Lee, 1941]. However, with amorphous or partially crystalline polymers, as for example with
polyethylene, the maximum in breakdown strength is seen to be absent and only a decrease is observed [Oakes,
1949]; as the crystalline content is increased in amorphous-crystalline solids, the breakdown strength is reduced.
