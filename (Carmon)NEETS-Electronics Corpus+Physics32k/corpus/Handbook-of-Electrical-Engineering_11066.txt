Cardiac muscle has been stimulated to contract with single pulses of eddy current. The Ô¨Årst to achieve this
feat  was  Bourland  et  al.  [1990]  who  applied  a  coplanar  coil  to  the  left  chest  of  an  anesthetized  dog.  Blood
pressure and the electrocardiogram were recorded and the heart was stopped by right vagal stimulation, during
which time a pulse of current was delivered to the coplanar coils and a ventricular contraction was produced,
showing an inverted QRS wave in the ECG and a blood-pressure pulse.
