The  simple  solution  to  this  problem  is  to  design  an  observer  (or  estimator),  which  produces  an  estimated
state vector ˆx(t). If this estimate asymptotically approaches the true state x(t), then we can simply combine the
observer and the state feedback to produce a feedback control u(t) = K ˆx(t). That we can simply substitute the
observed  value ˆx(t)  for  x(t)  in  the  feedback  function  is  a  fortunate  property  called  the  separation  principle,
which ensures that our controller calculations and observer calculations do not interfere with one another.
