In the 1950s and 1960s, Chomsky further formalized the
structure of an LM (Chomsky, 1959), and he and others
(Fu, 1982) generalized the concept of language and grammar
to any phenomenon or process that can be viewed as generat-
ing structured entities by building them from primitive pat-
terns (‘‘symbols’’) according to certain ‘‘production’’ rules. The
most restrictive type of grammar in Chomsky’s hierarchy, and
the one that is of most interest in practical application, is the
regular, or ﬁnite-state, grammar. In the parlance of the
HMM, Chomsky’s regular grammar contains production
rules that allow any ‘‘state’’ to produce a ‘‘symbol’’ plus a
new ‘‘state,’’ or to produce a sole ‘‘symbol.’’
