The prime time or the peak time is the block of broadcast programming taking place during the middle of the evening for television programming.
The term prime time is often defined in terms of a fixed time period â€“ for example (in the United States of America), from 7:00 to 10:00 (Central and Mountain Time) or 8:00 to 11:00 (Eastern and Pacific Time).
