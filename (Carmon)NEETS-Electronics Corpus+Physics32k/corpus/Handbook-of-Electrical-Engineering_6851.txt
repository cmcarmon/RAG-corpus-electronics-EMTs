Robustness  problems  are  usually  treated  analytically  via  minimax  formulations  that  seek  best  worst-case
performance as the design objective. This formulation has proven to be very useful in the design and charac-
terization of robust detectors for a wide variety of detection problems. Solutions typically call for the intro-
duction of light limiting to prevent extremes of gain dictated by an (unrealistic) nominal model. For example,
the correlation detector of Fig. 73.1 can be made robust against deviations from the Gaussian noise model by
introducing a soft-limiter between the multiplier and the accumulator.
