Series  and  parallel  combination  of 
capacitors 
 
In order to obtain a particular value of capacitance, 
fixed capacitors may be arranged in either series or 
parallel (Figs 2.30 and 2.31). The reciprocal of the 
effective  capacitance  of  each  of  the  series  circuits 
shown  in  Fig.  2.30  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the 
reciprocals  of  the  individual  capacitances.  Hence, 
for Fig. 2.30(a):
