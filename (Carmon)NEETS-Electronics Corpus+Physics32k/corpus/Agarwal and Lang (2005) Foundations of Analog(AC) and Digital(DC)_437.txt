node. Any node connected to the ground node through either an
independent or a dependent voltage source should be labeled with the
voltage of that source. The voltages of the remaining nodes are the
primary unknowns and should be labeled accordingly. In this chapter we
will denote the unknown node voltages by the symbol e. Since there are
generally far fewer nodes than branches in a circuit, there will be far fewer
primary unknowns to determine in a node analysis.
