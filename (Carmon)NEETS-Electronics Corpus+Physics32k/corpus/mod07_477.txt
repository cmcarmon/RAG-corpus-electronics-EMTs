C2 offers an infinite impedance (resistance) to the dc component of the output voltage. Thus, the dc 
voltage is passed to the load, but reduced in value by the amount of the voltage drop across R1. However, 
R1 is generally small compared to the load resistance. Therefore, the drop in the dc voltage by R1 is not a 
drawback.
