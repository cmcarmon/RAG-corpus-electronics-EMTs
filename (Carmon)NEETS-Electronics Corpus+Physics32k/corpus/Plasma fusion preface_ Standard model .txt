electron and positron ("anti-electron")
muon and anti-muon
tau and anti-tau
Along with these comes their neutrino and anti-neutrino which gives six distinct types of particles or:
electron
electron-neutrino
muon
muon-neutrino
tau
tau-neutrino
The neutrinos are preliminary massless and thus very hard to detect.
The dominant three of these are fundamentals and consist of quarks. For our purposes it is enough to recognize two types of quarks namely the up-quark and the down-quark. This is because a neutron consists of two down-quarks and one up-quark while a proton consists of two up-quarks and one down-quark.
As mentors at PF have explained, a neutron can undergo weak interaction (transmutation) and be converted to a proton releasing an electron and an anti-neutrino. This has to do with the fact that a quark can change its type/flavor. In this case one down-quark "only" has to change to one up-quark to make the change of the particle.
It has also been explained how a proton can be changed to a neutron in a similar manner.
This is the basic reason for all those protons at the birth of a star like our Sun can generate neutrons and thus Deuterium to actually start the fusion process to Helium.
