The predator equation becomes

{\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dt}}=\delta xy-\gamma y~.}

In this equation,




δ
x
y



{\displaystyle \displaystyle \delta xy}
represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey).




γ
y



{\displaystyle \displaystyle \gamma y}
represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration; it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.
Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.
