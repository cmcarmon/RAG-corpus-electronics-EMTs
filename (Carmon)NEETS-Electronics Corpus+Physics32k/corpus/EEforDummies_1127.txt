If you select too big a range, the reading you get wonâ€™t be as accurate. (For 
instance, on a 20 V range setting, your 9 V battery may produce a reading of 
8.27 V, but on a 200 V range setting, the same battery produces a reading of 
8.3 V. You often need as much precision in your readings as possible.)
