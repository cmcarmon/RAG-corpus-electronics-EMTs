A shunt generator maintains approximately constant voltage on load. It ﬁnds wide application
as an exciter for the ﬁeld circuit of large ac generators. The shunt generator is also sometimes
used as a tachogenerator when a signal proportional to the motor speed is required for control or
display purposes.
