There are additional differences in measuring optical fiber and optical connection properties in the
field than in the laboratory. Field measurements require rugged, portable test equipment, unlike the
sophisticated test equipment used in the laboratory. Field test equipment must provide accurate
measurements in extreme environmental conditions. Since electrical power sources may not always be
available in the field, test equipment should allow battery operation. In addition, while both fiber ends are
available for conducting laboratory measurements, only one fiber end may be readily available for field
measurements. Even if both fiber ends are available for field measurements, the fiber ends are normally
located some distance apart. Therefore, field measurements may require two people.
