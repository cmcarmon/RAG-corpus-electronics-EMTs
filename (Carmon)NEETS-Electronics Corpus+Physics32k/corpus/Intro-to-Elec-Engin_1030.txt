The ﬁrst and third terms on the right-hand side of Equation (12.4.25), involving the angular
rate of change of self-inductance, are the reluctance-torque terms; the middle term, involving the
angular rate of change of mutual inductance, is the excitation torque caused by the interaction of
ﬁelds produced by the stator and rotor currents in an electric machine. It is this mutual inductance
torque (or excitation torque) that is most commonly exploited in practical rotating machines.
Multiply excited systems with more than two sets of electrical terminals can be handled in
a manner similar to that for two pairs by assigning additional independent variables to the
terminals.
