that the relay can ‘‘see’’ the faults occurring in a forward
direction, looking from the relay position toward the adjacent
line terminal and beyond. The BR setting is selected so that the
relay can ‘‘see’’ the faults occurring in the backward direction,
causing a reversal of the power ﬂow. If the relay R1 (at location
A) has ‘‘seen’’ the fault (at location X1) in zone FO behind the
relay R2 positioned at the other end (at location B) of the line,
the relay is blocked by relay R2 from operating. Relay R2 has
‘‘seen’’ the fault at location X1 in a BR zone and, hence, can
‘‘tell’’ the relay R1 not to trip by sending a blocking signal.
Should a fault occur in between the two relays (location X2),
the blocking signal is not sent, and both relays operate instan-
taneously since both relays ‘‘see’’ the fault in zone FO and
neither in zone BR.
