Fusion can be shown in diagrams by full connecting lines between organs. Lost organs can be represented by a star (âœ¶), lost perianth parts or bracts/bracteoles can be shown with dashed stroke. It is possible to show the direction of monosymmetry by a large arrow. Resupination may be illustrated by a curved arrow. Floral parts can be accompanied by numbers to show their sequence of inicialization.
