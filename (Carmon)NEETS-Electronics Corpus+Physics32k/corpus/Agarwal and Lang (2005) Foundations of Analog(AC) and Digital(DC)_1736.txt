and that the characteristic equation, Equation 12.43, has a repeated root.
Because of this, e s1t and e s2t are no longer independent functions, and so
the general solution for v1 is no longer the superposition of these two func-
tions as given by Equation 12.48. Rather, it is the superposition of the repeated
exponential function
