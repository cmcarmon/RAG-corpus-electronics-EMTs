The quantitative degree to which the computed results conform to the mathematical and physical reality being 
modeled. Accuracy, preferably of known and, better yet, selectable value, is the single most important model attribute. 
e
It is determined by the physical modeling error (
The relative cost of obtaining the 
input and interpret the output and by the associated 
The applicability of the computer model in terms of problem size and complexity. Utility also relates to ease of use, 
reliability of results obtained, etc.
