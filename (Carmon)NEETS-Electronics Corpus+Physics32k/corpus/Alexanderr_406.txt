Our analysis of second-order circuits will be similar to that used for
ﬁrst-order. We  will  ﬁrst  consider  circuits  that  are  excited  by  the  ini-
tial  conditions  of  the  storage  elements. Although  these  circuits  may
contain  dependent  sources,  they  are  free  of  independent  sources.
These  source-free  circuits  will  give  natural  responses  as  expected.
Later  we  will  consider  circuits  that  are  excited  by  independent
sources. These  circuits  will  give  both  the  transient  response  and  the
steady-state  response.  We  consider  only  dc  independent  sources  in
this chapter. The case of sinusoidal and exponential sources is deferred
to later chapters.
