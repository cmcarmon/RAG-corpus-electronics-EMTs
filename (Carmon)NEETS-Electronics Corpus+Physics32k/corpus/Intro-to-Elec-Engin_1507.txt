• VT: Preset threshold, which is zero for polar and Manchester PCM. In the unipolar system,
it is equal to half the signal component of the integrator’s output level (A2Tb/2) at the
sampling time when the input has a binary 1. (After the sample is taken, the integrator is
discharged to 0 V in preparation for integration over the next bit interval.)
• D: The difference between the integrator’s output and VT at the end of each bit interval of
duration Tb. If D ≥ 0, binary 1 is declared; if D < 0, a 0 is declared.
• Square-wave clock: Generates a voltage A for 0 < t < Tb/2 and −A for Tb/2 < t < Tb,
with its fundamental frequency 1/Tb Hz. The product of the clock and the incoming
