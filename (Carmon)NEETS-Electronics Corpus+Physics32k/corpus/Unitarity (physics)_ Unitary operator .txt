More precisely, the operator which describes the progress of a physical system in time must be a unitary operator. When the Hamiltonian is time-independent the unitary operator is




e

−
i



H
^



t

/

ℏ




{\displaystyle e^{-i{\hat {H}}t/\hbar }}
.
Similarly, the S-matrix that describes how the physical system changes in a scattering process must be a unitary operator as well; this implies the optical theorem.
