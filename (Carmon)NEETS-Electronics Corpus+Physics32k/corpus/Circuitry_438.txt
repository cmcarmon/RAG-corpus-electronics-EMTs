This  simple  example  shows  that  a  loop  gain  of 
unity (or larger) will result in infinite  gain and an 
amplifier  which  is  unstable.  In  fact,  the  amplifier 
will  oscillate  since  any  disturbance  will  be 
amplified and result in an output.  
  Clearly,  as  far  as  an  amplifier  is  concerned, 
positive feedback may have an undesirable effectâ€”
instead  of  reducing  the  overall  gain  the  effect  is 
that of reinforcing any signal present and the output 
can build up into continuous oscillation if the loop 
gain  is  1  or  greater.  To  put  this  another  way, 
oscillator  circuits  can  simply  be  thought  of  as 
amplifiers  that  generate  an  output  signal  without 
the need for an input!
