Digital data is stored on a magnetic disk using magnetic pulses. These pulses are generated by 
passing a frequency modulated (FM) current through the disk drive's magnetic head. This FM current 
generates a magnetic field that magnetizes the particles of the disk's recording surface directly under the 
magnetic head. The pulse can be one of two polarities, positive or negative.
