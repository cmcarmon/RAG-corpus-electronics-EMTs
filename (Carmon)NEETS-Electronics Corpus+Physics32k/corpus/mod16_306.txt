coil balance. When this arrangement is used to measure the turning of the coil, a small mirror is mounted
on the supporting ribbon, as shown in figure 3-1. An internal light source is directed to the mirror and
then reflected to the scale of the meter. As the movable coil turns, so does the mirror. This causes the light
reflection to move across the graduated scale of the meter. The movement of the reflection is proportional
to the movement of the coil; therefore, the intensity of the current being measured by the meter is
accurately indicated.
