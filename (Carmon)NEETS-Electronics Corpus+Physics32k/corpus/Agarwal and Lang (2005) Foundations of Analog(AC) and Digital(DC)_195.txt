It seems reasonable, then, to look for an electrical source that has charac-
teristics that are the dual of those of the battery, in that the roles of current and
voltage are interchanged. From the point of view of v i characteristics, this is
a simple task. The ideal voltage source appears as a vertical line in v i space,
so this other source, which we call an ideal current source, should appear as a
horizontal line, as in Figure 1.34. Such a source maintains its output current at
some constant value I regardless of what voltage appears across the terminals.
