Power flow as a function of time for both of these cases is shown in Figure 13.53.
Note that in both cases the average power is zero. Thus, circuits with inductors
and capacitors but no resistors do not dissipate any power. The L’s and C’s
absorb power for two quarters of each cycle, and deliver the power back to the
source during the other two quarter cycles. Power companies are not happy
about this state of affairs, because they still must supply the power depicted
in Figure 13.53, even though they get it all back a few milliseconds later. The
problem is that the current associated with this instantaneous power causes i2R
power losses in the transmission lines, and the power company must pay for
this power loss, even though the customer is consuming zero power on the
average.12
