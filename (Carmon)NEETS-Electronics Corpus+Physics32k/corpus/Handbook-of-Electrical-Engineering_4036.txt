The  control  of  EMI  is  best  achieved  by  applying  good  interference  control  principles  during  the  design
process. These involve the selection of signal levels, impedance levels, frequencies, and circuit conÔ¨Ågurations
that minimize conducted and radiated interference. In addition, signal levels should be selected to be as low
as possible, while being consistent with the required signal-to-noise ratio. Impedance levels should be chosen
to minimize undesirable capacitive and inductive coupling.
