Magnetooptic recording system: A read/write data recording system based on a thermomagnetic process to
write  oppositely  magnetized  domains  onto  a  magnetooptic  medium  by  means  of  high-power  laser
heating. Magnetooptic Kerr effect is then employed to read the data by using a low-power laser as a probe
beam to sense the presence of these domains.
