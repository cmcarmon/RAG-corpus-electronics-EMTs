As  previously  noted  in  the  development  of  the  relations  for  external  and  internal  resistances,  Eq.  (33.19)
shows RT to be a strong function of the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient, the ﬂowing heat capacity of the
coolant, and geometric parameters (thickness and cross-sectional area of each layer). Thus, the introduction
of a superior coolant, use of thermal enhancement techniques that increase the local heat transfer coefﬁcient,
and selection of a heat transfer mode with inherently high heat transfer coefﬁcients (e.g., boiling) will all be
reﬂected in appropriately lower external and total thermal resistances. Similarly, improvements in the thermal
conductivity of and reduction in the thickness of the relatively low conductivity bonding materials (e.g., soft
solder, epoxy, silicone) would act to reduce the internal and total thermal resistances.
