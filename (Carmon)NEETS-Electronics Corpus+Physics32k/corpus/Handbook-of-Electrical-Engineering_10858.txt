The Ô¨Årst digital simulation systems were FORTRAN programs. Eventually, special purpose languages emerged
which allowed statements written in a form close to state equation notation to be translated into FORTRAN
which  enabled  the  engineer  to  concentrate  on  the  problem  description.  In  1967,  a  standard  language  called
CSSL (Continuous Systems Simulation Language) [Augustin et al., 1967] was proposed by the U.S. Simulation
Council and this forms the basis of most simulation languages in use today.
