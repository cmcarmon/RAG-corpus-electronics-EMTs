If a teletypewriter signal could be drawn on paper, it would resemble figure 3-18. This is the code 
combination for the letter R. Shaded areas show intervals during which the circuit is closed, and the blank 
areas show the intervals during which the circuit is open. The signal has a total of seven units. Five of 
these are numbered and are called INTELLIGENCE units. The first and last units of the signal are labeled 
START and STOP. They are named after their functions: the first starts the signal, and the last stops it. 
These are a part of every teletypewriter code signal: the START unit is always spacing, and the STOP 
unit is always marking.
