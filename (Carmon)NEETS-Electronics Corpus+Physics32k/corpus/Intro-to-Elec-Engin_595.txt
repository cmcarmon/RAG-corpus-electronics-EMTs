Network Architecture
A protocol is a formal description of message formats and the rules two or more machines
must follow to exchange those messages. Because TCP (transmission control protocol) and IP
(Internet protocol) are the two most fundamental protocols, the entire protocol suite that is used
by the Internet is often referred to as TCP/IP. X.25 is the CCITT (Consultative Committee on
International Telephony and Telegraphy) standard protocol employed by Telnet, and is most
popular in Europe. Ethernet utilizes CSMA/CD (carrier sense multiple access with collision
detection) protocol technology.
