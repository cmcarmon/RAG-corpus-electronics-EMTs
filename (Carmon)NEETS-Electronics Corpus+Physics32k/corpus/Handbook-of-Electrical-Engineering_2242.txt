where s is the number of the highest occupied Landau level. Accordingly, when the increased magnetic ﬁeld
pushes the sth Landau level above the Fermi level, rxy changes from h/sq2 to h/(s–1)q2. This stepwise change of
rxy is seen in Fig. 22.7. Localized states produced by crystal defects determine the shape of the rxy(B) dependence
between the plateaus given by Eq. (22.14). They are also responsible for the disappearance of rxx = Vx/Ix between
the  transition  points  (see  Fig. 22.7).  The  quantized  Hall  resistance rxy  is  expressed  in  terms  of  fundamental
constants and can be used as a resistance standard that permits one to measure an electrical resistance with
better accuracy than any wire resistor standard. In an ultraquantum magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., when only the lowest
Landau level is occupied, plateaus of the Hall resistance are also observed at fractional s (the fractional quantum
Hall effect). These plateaus are related to the Coulomb interaction of electrons.
