This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art research in the area
of multimedia systems. Section 6.2 reviews storage and coding
techniques for different media types. Section 6.3 studies fun-
damental issues related to the representation of multimedia
data and discusses salient indexing and retrieval approaches
introduced in the literature. For the sake of compactness and
focus, this chapter reviews only CBIR techniques for visual
data (i.e., for images and videos); the review of systems for
audio data readers are referred to Foote (1999).
