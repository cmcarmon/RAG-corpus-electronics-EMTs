Transformer Losses
The heat developed in a transformer is a function of the losses that occur during transformation. Therefore,
the transformer losses must be minimized and the heat due to the losses must be efﬁciently conducted away
from  the  core,  the  windings,  and  the  cooling  medium.  The  losses  in  a  transformer  are  grouped  into  two
categories: (1) no-load losses and (2) load losses. The no-load losses are the losses in the core due to excitation
and are mostly composed of hysteresis and eddy current losses. The load losses are grouped into three categories:
(1) winding  I2R losses, (2) winding eddy current losses, and (3) other stray losses. The winding  I2R losses are
the result of the ﬂow of load current through the resistance of the primary and secondary windings. The winding
eddy current losses are caused by the magnetic ﬁeld set up by the winding current, due to formation of eddy
voltages  in  the  conductors.  The  winding  eddy  losses  are  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  rms  value  of  the
current and to the square of the frequency of the current. When transformers are required to supply loads that
are rich in harmonic frequency components, the eddy loss factor must be given extra consideration. The other
stray  loss  component  is  the  result  of  induced  currents  in  the  buswork,  core  clamps,  and  tank  walls  by  the
magnetic ﬁeld set up by the load current.
