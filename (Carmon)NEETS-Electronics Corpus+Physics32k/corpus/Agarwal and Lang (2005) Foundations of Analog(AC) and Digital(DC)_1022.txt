Although we can analyze circuits directly with the model in Figure 7.49b, our analysis
can be significantly simplified by using simple piecewise-linear models for the diodes.
Figure 7.49c depicts such a piecewise-linear model for the BJT, in which we have replaced
the diodes with simple piecewise-linear diode models comprising an ideal diode in series
with a voltage source (from Figure 4.33a). In the model in Figure 7.49c, the dependent
current source models the horizontal active region curves of the BJT.
