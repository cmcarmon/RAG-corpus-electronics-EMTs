IC packages 
 
As with transistors, a variety of different packages 
are  used  for  integrated  circuits.  The  most  popular 
form of encapsulation used for integrated circuits is 
the  dual-in-line  (DIL) package  which  may  be 
fabricated  from  either  plastic  or  ceramic  material 
(with  the  latter  using  a  glass  hermetic  sealant) 
Common DIL packages have 8, 14, 16, 28 and 40 
pins on a 0.1 inch matrix.  
  Flat  package  (flatpack) construction  (featuring 
both  glass-metal  and  glass-ceramic  seals  and 
welded  construction)  are  popular 
for  planar 
mounting  on  flat  circuit  boards.  No  holes  are 
required to accommodate the leads of such devices 
which  are  arranged  on  a  0.05  inch  pitch  (i.e.  half 
the  pitch  used  with  DIL  devices).  Single-in-line 
(SIL) and  quad-in-line  (QIL) packages  are  also 
becoming  increasingly  popular  while  TO5,  TO72, 
TO3 and TO220 encapsulations are also found (the 
latter  being  commonly  used  for  three-terminal 
voltage regulators). Figure 5.36 shows a variety of 
common  integrated  circuit  packages  whilst  Fig. 
5.37 shows a modern LSI device.
