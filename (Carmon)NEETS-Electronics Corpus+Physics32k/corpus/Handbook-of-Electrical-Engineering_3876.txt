The Oscillator or Discrete Radiator
The  basic  building  block  for  antenna  analysis  is  a  linear  conductor.  Movement  of  electrons  (current)  in  the
conductor  induces  an  electromagnetic  ﬁeld.  When  the  electron  motion  is  oscillatory—e.g.,  a  dipole  with
periodic electron motion, the induced electric ﬁeld, E, is proportional to cos(wt –  kx + f), where w is radian
frequency of oscillation, t is time, k is wave number, x is distance from the oscillator, and f is the phase associated
with  this  oscillator  (relative  to  the  time  and  spatial  coordinate  origins). When  the  analysis  is  restricted  to  a
ﬁxed position x, the electric ﬁeld can be expressed as
