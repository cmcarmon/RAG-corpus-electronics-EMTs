The second equality in Equation 2.11 demonstrates that the voltage between two
nodes is independent of the path along which it accumulated. In this case, the second
equality shows that the voltage between Nodes 1 and M is the same whether accumu-
lated along the path up the left side of the loop or the path up the right side of the
loop.
