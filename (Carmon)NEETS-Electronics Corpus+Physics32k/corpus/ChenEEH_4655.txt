An important issue in practical applications is how to address
transport delay inherent in many physical systems. Although
relatively little attention has been given to SMC for this class of
systems in the open literature, several good works have recently
appeared that address some of the associated difﬁculties. For
example, necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of
sliding modes for a multidimensional system are given in
Jafarov (1990), where the asymptotic stability of the system on
the sliding surface using a Lyapunov-Krasovsky functional
is proved. Drakunov and Utkin (1992) give the two-stage
design procedure for dynamic systems that can be written in
