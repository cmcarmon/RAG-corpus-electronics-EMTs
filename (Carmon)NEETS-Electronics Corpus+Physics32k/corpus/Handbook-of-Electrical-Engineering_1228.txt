where it is tacitly assumed that q £ r . From this expression, it follows that the mapping from A into A(q) is one-
to-one when sq > sq+1 but is one-to-many (inﬁnity) if sq = sq+1. The special case in which sq = sq+1 therefore
results in a point-to-set mapping and gives rise to subtle issues which are addressed in the following theorem
[Mittelmann and Cadzow, 1987].
Theorem 8. Let the m ·  n matrix A ˛  Cm · n have the SVD decomposition (14.101) in which r = rank(A).
The best rank-q Frobenius norm approximation of A as given by expression (14.102) is unique if and only if
sq > sq+1. The projection operator  P(q) from A into A(q) as designated by
