Although power BJTs have low on-state resistance, their oper-
ation involves circuit complexity and signiﬁcant losses in the
control circuitry because of the current-controlled nature of
device operation. On the other hand, MOSFETs involve rela-
tively simple gate drive circuits but have signiﬁcant losses
during forward conduction at higher blocking voltages. Im-
proved overall performance is achieved by merging the advan-
tages of bipolar conduction with MOS-gate control. Several
hybrid MOS-gate transistors have been introduced. Among
