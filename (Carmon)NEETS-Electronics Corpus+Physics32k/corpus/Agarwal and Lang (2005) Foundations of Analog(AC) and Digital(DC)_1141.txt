Since the input offset is 2.2 V, and the maximum valid input voltage is
2.32 V, the maximum positive swing for saturation region operation of the
MOSFET is given by 2.32 V − 2.2 V = 0.12 V. Thus, the maximum peak-
to-peak swing for the input sinusoid is 2 × 0.12 V = 0.24 V. Notice the clear
tradeoff we have made between gain and dynamic range. To increase the gain,
we had to bias the amplifier with a high input bias voltage, which was close
to the high end of the valid input signal range. However, the high input bias
voltage limited the positive signal swing.
