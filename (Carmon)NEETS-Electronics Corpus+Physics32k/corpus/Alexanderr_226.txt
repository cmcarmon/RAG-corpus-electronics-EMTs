3. The  superposition  principle  states  that  for  a  circuit  having  multi-
ple independent sources, the voltage across (or current through) an
element is equal to the algebraic sum of all the individual voltages
(or currents) due to each independent source acting one at a time.
4. Source  transformation  is  a  procedure  for  transforming  a  voltage
source in series with a resistor to a current source in parallel with
a resistor, or vice versa.
