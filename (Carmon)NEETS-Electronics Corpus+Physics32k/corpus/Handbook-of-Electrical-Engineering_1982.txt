DSP Processors
Digital signal processors are currently available from a number of companies, including Texas Instruments,
Inc.  (Texas),  Motorola,  Inc.  (Arizona),  Analog  Devices,  Inc.  (Massachusetts),  AT&T  (New  Jersey),  and  NEC
(California). These processors are categorized as either ﬁxed-point or ﬂoating-point processors. Several com-
panies are now supporting both types of processors. Special-purpose digital signal processors, designed for a
speciﬁc signal processing application such as for fast Fourier transform (FFT), have also emerged. Currently
available digital signal processors range from simple, low cost processing units through high performance units
such  as  Texas  Instruments’  (TI)  TMS320C40  (Chassaing  and  Martin,  1995)  and  TMS320C80,  and  Analog
Devices1 ADSP-21060 SHARC (Chassaing and Ayers, 1996).
