Emulation
Concept
In a microprogrammed environment, a computer architecture is softly (or ﬁrmly) deﬁned by the microprogram
designed to implement its operations, its data paths, and its machine-level instructions. It is easy to see that if
one  changes  the  microprogram  for  another  one,  then  a  new  computer  is  deﬁned.  In  this  environment,  the
desired operation is simulated by the execution of the ﬁrmware, instead of being the result of action on real
hardwired components.
