15.3.26 Consider Figure 15.3.19, in which the receiver
becomes two coherent ASK receivers in parallel.
Justify why the difference, rather than the sum,
occurs.
15.3.27 Consider Figure 15.3.19, in which the input FSK
pulse at point R is given by sR(t ) = A cos(ω2t +
φ2), 0 < t < Tb, and zero elsewhere in t, when
the bit interval corresponds to a 1.
(a) Compute the outputs from the two integrators.
(b) If sR(t) changes in frequency and phase to ω1
and φ1, respectively, show that the two outputs
of part (a) are reversed. (Assume ωcTb >> 1,
and make suitable approximations.)
