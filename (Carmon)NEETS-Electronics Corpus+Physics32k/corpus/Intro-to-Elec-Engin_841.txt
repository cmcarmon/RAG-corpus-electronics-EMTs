Figure 10.2.3 Convention for positive power ï¬‚ow. (a) Generator case. If P is positive, then real power is
delivered. If Q is positive, then reactive power is delivered. If P is negative, then real power is absorbed. If
Q is negative, then reactive power is absorbed. (b) Load case. If P is positive, then real power is absorbed. If
Q is positive, then reactive power is absorbed. If P is negative, then real power is delivered. If Q is negative,
then reactive power is delivered.
