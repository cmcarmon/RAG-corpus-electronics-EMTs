The magnitude of current flow is directly related to the amount of energy that passes through a
conductor as a result of the drift action. An increase in the number of energy carriers (the mobile
electrons) or an increase in the energy of the existing mobile electrons would provide an increase in
current flow. When an electric potential is impressed across a conductor, there is an increase in the
velocity of the mobile electrons causing an increase in the energy of the carriers. There is also the
generation of an increased number of electrons providing added carriers of energy. The additional number
of free electrons is relatively small, hence the magnitude of current flow is primarily dependent on the
velocity of the existing mobile electrons.
