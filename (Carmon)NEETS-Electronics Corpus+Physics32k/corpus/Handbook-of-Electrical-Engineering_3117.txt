The RCTs are designed mainly for speciÔ¨Åc applications such as traction drives. The antiparallel diode limits
the reverse voltage across the thyristor to 1 to 2 V. Also, because of the reverse recovery behavior of the diodes,
when the diode recovers from its reverse voltage. This necessitates
the thyristor may see very high reapplied 
snubber networks to suppress voltage transients. As the range of application of thyristors and
 
use of large RC
diodes  extends  into  higher  frequencies,  their  reverse  recovery  charge  becomes  increasingly  important.  High
reverse recovery charge results in high power dissipation during switching.
