Sand boils occur when a dike completely penetrates the non-liquefied layer above it and reaches the ground surface. The water pressure in the liquefied layer causes an eruption of liquefied soil at the ground surface, often resembling a volcano. This can carry large amounts of sand to the surface, covering areas tens of feet or more in diameter. This makes sand boils an easy paleoliquefaction feature to locate using aerial photography. In many areas of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, a significant portion of the ground can be covered by sand carried to the surface by sand boils.
