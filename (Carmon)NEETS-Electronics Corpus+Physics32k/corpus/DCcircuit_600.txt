In this case, I’ll begin my tracing of this circuit at the negative terminal of the battery and
ﬁnish at the positive terminal, in the same general direction as the electrons would ﬂow. When
tracing this direction, I will mark each resistor with the polarity of negative on the entering
side and positive on the exiting side, for that is how the actual polarity will be as electrons
(negative in charge) enter and exit a resistor:
