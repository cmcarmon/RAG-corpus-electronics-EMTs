  4.  Operating voltage? Voltages from collector to 
emitter, collector to base, and emitter to base 
should be noted either from the schematic 
 diagram or by actual voltage measurement. The 
transistor selected for replacement should have 
voltage ratings that are at least three to four times 
the actual operating voltage. This helps to protect 
against voltage spikes, transients, and surges that 
are inherent in most circuits.
