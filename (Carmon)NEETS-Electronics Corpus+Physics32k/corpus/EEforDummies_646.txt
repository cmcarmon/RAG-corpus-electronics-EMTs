▶✓ DC current gain (hFE or β): The ratio of collector current to base current 
(that is, IC/IB), which provides an indication of the amplifying capability 
of the transistor. Typical values are 50 to 200. Because the current gain 
can vary — even among transistors of the same type — you need to 
know the guaranteed minimum value of hFE, and that’s what this param-
eter tells you. The hFE value also varies for different values of IC, so some-
times hFE is given for a specific value of IC, such as 20 mA.
