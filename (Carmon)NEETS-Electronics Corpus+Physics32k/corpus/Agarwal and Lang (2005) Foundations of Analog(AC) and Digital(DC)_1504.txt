Let us use the memory element that we have just defined in a simple digital design.
Recall the motion detector circuit from Chapter 5. The motion detector circuit was
required to produce a signal L to turn on a set of lights when the signal M from a
motion sensor was high, provided it was not daytime. We assumed that a light sensor
produced a signal D that was high when it was day. We had written the following logic
expression for L:
