Sound waves vary in length according to their frequency. A sound having a long wavelength is heard
at a low pitch (low frequency); one with a short wavelength is heard at a high pitch (high frequency). A
complete wavelength is called a cycle. The distance from one point on a wave to the corresponding point
on the next wave is a wavelength. The number of cycles per second (hertz) is the frequency of the sound.
The frequency of a sound wave is also the number of vibrations per second produced by the sound source.
