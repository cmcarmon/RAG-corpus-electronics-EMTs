1 = R1 · Cin = 100 W · 50.4 pF = 5040 ps = 5.04 ns, and t2 = Rnet · CO = 2 kW · 15 pF = 30 ns. The
corresponding breakpoint frequencies are f1 = 1/(2p · 5.04 ns) = 31.6 MHz and f2 = 1/(2p · 30 ns)= 5.3 MHz.
The  3-dB  frequency  of  the  ampliﬁer  can  be  obtained  from  (1/f3dB)2  @  (1/f1)2  +  (1/f2)2  =  (1/31.6  MHz)2  +
(1/5.3 MHz)2,  which  gives  f3dB @  5.2  MHz.  The  10  to  90%  rise  time  can  be  obtained  from  trise @  0.35/f3dB  =
0.35/5.2 MHz = 67 ns.
