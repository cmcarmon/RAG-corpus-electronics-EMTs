Nonlinear Electromagnetic Properties
Basically,  the  nonlinear  electromagnetic  properties  can  manifest  as  two  subsets  of  material  characteristics,
namely, 
Nonlinear Dielectric Properties
Dielectric materials whose permittivity has a distinct dependence on the intensity of the applied electric Ô¨Åeld
are referred to as active or nonlinear dielectrics. Such materials demonstrate very high values of permittivity
(in the order of several thousand), pronounced dependence of dielectric parameters on the temperature, and
a loop of electric hysteresis under the action of an alternating voltage.
