With the development of partially reconﬁgurable FPGAs, it
is possible to reduce the overhead of reconﬁguration: the
smaller the circuit to be conﬁgured, the shorter time it takes.
Existing components are replaced by new ones at run time by
partially reconﬁguring the appropriate parts of the FPGA,
while the rest of the FPGA continues to operate. The same
principle applies to systems containing multiple FPGAs; com-
putation and conﬁguration can take place concurrently in
different devices.
