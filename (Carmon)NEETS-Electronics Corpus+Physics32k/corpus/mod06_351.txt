not. In most applications in electronics, this method is not used because it is not as efficient as thermionic
emission. There are two applications where cold-cathode emission is used. The first application you are
already familiar with, although you may not be aware of it. Every time you look at a neon sign you are
watching a cold-cathode tube in operation. Thus, the first application of cold-cathode tubes is for visual
display. You are also familiar with the reason for this visual display. In the NEETS module on matter and
energy, we explained that when energy is fed into an atom (neon in this case), electrons are moved, or
promoted, to higher orbits. When they fall back, they release the energy that originally lifted them to their
higher orbits. The energy is in the form of light. Cold-cathode tubes are also used as VOLTAGE
REGULATORS. Because voltage regulators will be dealt with extensively in the next chapter, we will
not cover their operation now. At this point, you only need to understand that a cold-cathode tube has the
ability to maintain a constant voltage drop across the tube despite changes of current flow through the
tube. The tube does this by changing resistance as current flow varies.
