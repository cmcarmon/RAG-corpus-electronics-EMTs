It can be veriﬁed easily that Gaussian, Laplace (or two-sided
exponential), binomial, and Poisson distributions all belong to
the EFOD. When a pdf belongs to the EFOD, one can easily
identify the sufﬁcient statistic. In fact, the mean and variance
of the sufﬁcient statistic can be easily calculated (Bickel and
Doksum, 1977).
