Signal detection and ampliﬁcation remain a critical focus of good DRAM design. Figure 80.3 illustrates an
arrangement called a “folded bit line.” This design cancels many of the noise sources originating in the array
and  decreases  circuit  sensitivity  to  manufacturing  process  variations.  It  also  achieves  a  high  ratio  of  storage
cells per sense ampliﬁer. Note the presence of the dummy cells, which create a reference signal midway between
a “one”  and  a “zero”  for  the  convenience  of  the  sense  ampliﬁer.  The  stored  reference  voltage  in  this  case  is
created by shorting two driven bit lines after one of the storage cells has been written.
