During circular motion the body moves on a curve that can be described in polar coordinate system as a fixed distance R from the center of the orbit taken as origin, oriented at an angle θ(t) from some reference direction. See Figure 4. The displacement vector






r
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
is the radial vector from the origin to the particle location:







r
→



(
t
)
=
R




u
^




R


(
t
)

,


{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}(t)=R{\hat {u}}_{R}(t)\ ,}

where







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
is the unit vector parallel to the radius vector at time t and pointing away from the origin. It is convenient to introduce the unit vector orthogonal to







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
as well, namely







u
^




θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
. It is customary to orient







u
^




θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
to point in the direction of travel along the orbit.
The velocity is the time derivative of the displacement:

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}(t)={\frac {d}{dt}}{\vec {r}}(t)={\frac {dR}{dt}}{\hat {u}}_{R}(t)+R{\frac {d{\hat {u}}_{R}}{dt}}\ .}

Because the radius of the circle is constant, the radial component of the velocity is zero. The unit vector







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
has a time-invariant magnitude of unity, so as time varies its tip always lies on a circle of unit radius, with an angle θ the same as the angle of






r
→



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}(t)}
. If the particle displacement rotates through an angle dθ in time dt, so does







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
, describing an arc on the unit circle of magnitude dθ. See the unit circle at the left of Figure 4. Hence:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d{\hat {u}}_{R}}{dt}}={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}{\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)\ ,}

where the direction of the change must be perpendicular to







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
(or, in other words, along







u
^




θ


(
t

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
) because any change



d

R


(

{\displaystyle d{\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
in the direction of







u

R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
would change the size of







u
^




R


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
. The sign is positive, because an increase in dθ implies the object and







u

(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
have moved in the direction of







u
^




θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
. Hence the velocity becomes:

The acceleration of the body can also be broken into radial and tangential components. The acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\vec {a}}(t)&={\frac {d}{dt}}{\vec {v}}(t)={\frac {d}{dt}}\left(R\omega {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)\right)\\&=R\left({\frac {d\omega }{dt}}{\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)+\omega {\frac {d{\hat {u}}_{\theta }}{dt}}\right)\ .\end{aligned}}}

The time derivative of







u

θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
is found the same way as for







u

R


(

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
. Again,







u
^




θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
is a unit vector and its tip traces a unit circle with an angle that is π/2 + θ. Hence, an increase in angle dθ by






r

(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}(t)}
implies







u
^




θ


(
t

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
traces an arc of magnitude dθ, and as

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}

{\displaystyle {\frac {d{\hat {u}}_{\theta }}{dt}}=-{\frac {d\theta }{dt}}{\hat {u}}_{R}(t)=-\omega {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)\ ,}

where a negative sign is necessary to keep







u
^




θ


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
orthogonal to







u

R


(

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
. (Otherwise, the angle between

(

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{\theta }(t)}
and







u
^




R


(

{\displaystyle {\hat {u}}_{R}(t)}
would decrease with increase in dθ.) See the unit circle at the left of Figure 4. Consequently, the acceleration is:
