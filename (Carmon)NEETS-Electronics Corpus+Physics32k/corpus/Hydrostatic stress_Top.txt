In continuum mechanics, a hydrostatic stress is an isotropic stress that is given by the weight of water above a certain point. It is often used interchangeably with "pressure" and is also known as confining stress, particularly in the field of geomechanics. Its magnitude

{\displaystyle \sigma _{h}}
can be given by:

{\displaystyle \sigma _{h}=\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}\rho _{i}gh_{i}}

where



i


{\displaystyle i}
is an index denoting each distinct layer of material above the point of interest,




ρ

i




{\displaystyle \rho _{i}}
is the density of each layer,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration (assumed constant here; this can be substituted with any acceleration that is important in defining weight), and




h

i




{\displaystyle h_{i}}
is the height (or thickness) of each given layer of material. For example, the magnitude of the hydrostatic stress felt at a point under ten meters of fresh water would be

Because the hydrostatic stress is isotropic, it acts equally in all directions. In tensor form, the hydrostatic stress is equal to
