As we investigate the atom, we find that it is basically composed of electrons, protons, and neutrons.
Furthermore, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of one element are identical to those of any other
element. There are different kinds of elements because the number and the arrangement of electrons and
protons are different for each element.
