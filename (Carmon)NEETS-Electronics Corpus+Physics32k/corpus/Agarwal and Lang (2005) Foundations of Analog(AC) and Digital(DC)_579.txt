The v i relationship for yet another two-terminal nonlinear device is
shown in Equation 4.3. Figure 8.11 in Chapter 8 introduces such a nonlinear
device. For this device the current is related to the square of the terminal voltage.
In this equation, K and VT are constants. The variables iDS and vDS are the
terminal variables for the device. The relationship is plotted in Figure 4.4.
