being sold. Each of the mirrors has an operating goal of 1010
cycles for more than 10 years (essentially running at 30 Hz for
that entire period). No speciﬁcs on DMD failures are available,
but the number is said to be small. Here again, simple estimates
yield a remarkable value for the temporal failure rate, namely
one failure in 1014 cycles, which exceeds 109 hours. The salient
point is that DMDs that pass the manufacturer’s tests have
proven to be very reliable in actual use.
