With an ac voltage, in the first quarter-cycle (0º  to 90º ) the applied ac voltage is continually 
increasing. If there was no inductance in the circuit, the current would also increase during this first 
quarter-cycle. You know this circuit does have inductance. Since inductance opposes any change in 
current flow, no current flows during the first quarter-cycle. In the next quarter-cycle (90º  to 180º ) the 
voltage decreases back to zero; current begins to flow in the circuit and reaches a maximum value at the 
same instant the voltage reaches zero. The applied voltage now begins to build up to maximum in the 
other direction, to be followed by the resulting current. When the voltage again reaches its maximum at 
the end of the third quarter-cycle (270º ) all values are exactly opposite to what they were during the first 
half-cycle. The applied voltage leads the resulting current by one quarter-cycle or 90 degrees. To 
complete the full 360º  cycle of the voltage, the voltage again decreases to zero and the current builds to a 
maximum value.
