In addition to serving as the prototypical example of the
boundary value problem for Laplace’s equation, this solution
of the sphere immersed in the uniform ﬁeld can be used to
show the relationship between the D ﬁeld and the phenom-
enon of polarization. The polarization, P, is deﬁned as the
dipole moment per unit volume in a dielectric. In the example,
the sphere has an induced dipole moment per unit volume
given by:
