For a cell to cover another cell (the dependent cell), the
cover cell must be able to duplicate the functionality of the
dependent cell. In an FPGA, all cells are identical, so conÔ¨Ågu-
ration data for the dependent cell can simply be transposed to
the cover cell. The cover cell must also be able to duplicate the
connectivity of the dependent cell with respect to the rest of
the array. This is accomplished by ensuring that each net
connected to a cell through a channel segment also includes
the corresponding cover segment, CS, bordering the cover cell.
Cover segments are included in a net in one of two ways. First,
segments in the net may already be in positions to act as
covers. In case the above condition does not hold, additional
segments should be attached to the net to provide covers.
Figure 8.7 illustrates the use of CSs.
