Kepler discovered his "third law" a decade after the publication of the Astronomia nova as a result of his investigations in the 1619 Harmonices Mundi (Harmonies of the world). He found that the ratio of the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of each planet's orbit, to the square of time of its orbital period, is the same for all planets.
