Resonators are fundamental building blocks for microwave
ﬁlters, diplexers, frequency discriminators, and tuners. Reson-
ators are used for frequency stabilization in oscillators or as
control or tuning elements for ampliﬁers. A resonator is gen-
erally a structure that conﬁnes electromagnetic energy either
inside a block of dielectric material, inside a section of metallic
waveguide enclosure (Figure 7.25), or between the open or
