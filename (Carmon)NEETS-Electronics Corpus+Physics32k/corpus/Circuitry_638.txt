The resulting aerial is known as a three-element 
Yagi  aerial,  see  Fig.  13.24.  If  desired,  additional 
directors can be added to further increase the gain 
of  the  aerial  and  reduce  the  beamwidth  of  the 
major  lobe.  A  typical  three-element  horizontally 
polarized Yagi suitable for VHF Band II  broadcast 
reception is shown in Fig. 13.25.
