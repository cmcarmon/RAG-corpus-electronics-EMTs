The zeroth coeﬃcient equals the signal’s average value and is real-valued for real-valued signals: c0 =
1
0 s(t) dt. In general, the other Fourier coeﬃcients are complex-valued; we will ﬁnd many special cases
T
wherein come coeﬃcients are real-valued. The family of functions
are called basis functions and
form the foundation of the Fourier series. No matter what the periodic signal might be, these functions are
always present and form the representation’s building blocks. They depend on the signal period T , and are
indexed by k.
