Crossover Distortion
This type of distortion occurs in circuits that use devices operating in a “push-pull” manner. The devices are
used  in  pairs  and  each  device  operates  only  for  half  a  cycle  of  the  input  signal  (Class  AB  operation).  One
advantage of such an arrangement is the cancellation of even harmonic terms resulting in smaller total harmonic
distortion. However, if the circuit is not designed to achieve a smooth crossover or transition from one device
to another, then there is a region of the transfer characteristics when the output is zero. The resulting distortion
is called crossover distortion.
