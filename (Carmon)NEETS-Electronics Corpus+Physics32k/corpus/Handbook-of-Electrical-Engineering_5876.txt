Equation (66.2) expresses the ﬂuxes in terms of relevant currents:
ﬂux is equal to inductance times current, with inductances G(s), Xd(s),
Xq(s) given in an operational form (s denotes the derivative operator).
Figure 66.6 gives a general view of the input–output state descrip-
tion of machine’s dynamic model, the state variables of which appear
in Eqs. (66.1) and (66.2).
