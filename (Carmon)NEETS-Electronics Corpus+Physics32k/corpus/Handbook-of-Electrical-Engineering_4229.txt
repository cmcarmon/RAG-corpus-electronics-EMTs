Radar Cross Section
In  practice,  the 
  (RCS)  of  a  realistic  target  must  be  considered  a  random  variable  with  an
associated  correlation  interval.  Targets  are  composed  of  multiple  interacting  scatters  so  that  the  composite
return varies in magnitude with the constructive and destructive interference of the contributing returns. The
target RCS is typically estimated as the mean or median of the target RCS distribution. The associated correlation
interval indicates the rate at which the target RCS varies over time. RCS ï¬‚uctuation degrades target detection
performance at moderate to high probability of detection.
