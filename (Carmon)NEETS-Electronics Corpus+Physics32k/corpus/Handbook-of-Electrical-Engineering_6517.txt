The actual impairment from these distortion products depends on the spectrum of each RF channel and on
the exact frequency plan used. A typical 42-channel AM-VSB frequency plan, with carrier frequencies shown
as  the  vertical  bars  on  Fig. 71.4,  results  in  the  distributions  of  second-  and  third-order  products  shown  in
Fig. 71.4(a) and (b), respectively. Since the remaining carrier is the dominant feature in the spectrum of each
channel,  the  distortion  products  are  dominated  by  the  mixing  between  these  carriers.  Because  high-quality
video requires that the CSO is –60 dBc (dB relative to the carrier), each sum or difference product must be less
than –73 dBc. Likewise, for the CTB to be less than 60 dB, each product must be less than approximately –90dB.
