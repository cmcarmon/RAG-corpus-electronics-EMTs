Because a hand-to-hand shock current path is the most dangerous, holding the meter probes
on two points in a high-voltage circuit in this manner is always a potential hazard. If the
protective insulation on the probes is worn or cracked, it is possible for the user’s ﬁngers to
come into contact with the probe conductors during the time of test, causing a bad shock to
occur. If it is possible to use only one hand to grasp the probes, that is a safer option. Sometimes
it is possible to ”latch” one probe tip onto the circuit test point so that it can be let go of and
the other probe set in place, using only one hand. Special probe tip accessories such as spring
clips can be attached to help facilitate this.
