Packet Switching
A message is divided into a number of smaller packets, and one
packet at a time is sent through the network. There are two
approaches in packet switching: (1) datagram will not need to
establish a connection path, and each packet is treated inde-
pendently; and (2) the virtual circuit approach requires that a
connection be established, and all packets will need to go over
that connection path. There is less overhead on the retransmis-
sion as the packet is smaller; overlap of the transmission is
possible. Virtual circuit is more suitable for interactive trafÔ¨Åc
because it has smaller delay.
