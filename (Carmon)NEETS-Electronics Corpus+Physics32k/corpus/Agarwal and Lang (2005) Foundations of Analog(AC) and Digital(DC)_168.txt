p o w e r s u p p l i e d b y a b a t t e r y Determine
the power for the battery using the two assignments of terminal variables in Figures 1.25a
and 1.25b.
For the assignment of terminal variables in Figure 1.25a, i = −2 A and v = 3 V. Thus,
by associated variables, power into the battery is given by
p = vi = (3V )(−2A) = −6 W
