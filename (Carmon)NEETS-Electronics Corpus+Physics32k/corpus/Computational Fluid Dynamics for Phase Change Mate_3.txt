Two main thermal characteristics of phase change are the enthalpy-temperature relationship and temperature hysteresis. PCMs tend to have varying enthalpy temperature relationships due to the fact that they are blends of different materials, but pure PCMs have a more localized relationship, which can be approximated by single values for the enthalpy and phase change temperature.
Hysteresis is the phenomenon which causes the PCM to melt and freezes in different temperature ranges and with different enthalpies,which results in a different temperature-enthalpy curve for melting and freezing. Hysteresis is related to the chemical and kinetic properties of the material.
The commonly used enthalpy-porosity model in commercial CFD codes assumes, a linear enthalpy-temperature relationship and ignores hysteresis.[8]
The alternate is to use enthalpy-porosity method. When used to simulate PCM sails and a PCM plate-fin unit it produce reasonable temperature prediction in global space temperature terms. However there are inaccuracies in transient simulations where time dependent PCM and local wall and air temperatures are of interest. This is over come by use of source terms that considers hysteresis and varying enthalpy-temperature relationship. [9][10]
CFD-DEM model are also used sometimes. Phase motion of discrete solids or particles is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navierâ€“Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).CFDEMcoupling (DCS Computing GmbH) is one such open source toolbox for CFD-DEM coupling.
