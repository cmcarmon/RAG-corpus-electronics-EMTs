From an algebraic standpoint (Bretscher, 1996), equation
4.31 requires that any clock schedule s must necessarily be in
the kernel ker(B) of the linear transformation B: Rp ! Rnc
(that is s 2 ker B). The inverse situation, however, is not true;
that is, an arbitrary element of the kernel is not necessarily
a feasible clock schedule. Furthermore, note that B is already
in reduced row echelon form (Bretscher, 1996) so the rank of
B is rank(B) Â¼ nc. Thus, the dimension of ker (B) is [33] as
follows:
