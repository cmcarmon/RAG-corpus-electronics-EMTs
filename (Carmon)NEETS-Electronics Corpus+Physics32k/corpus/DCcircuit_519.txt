An alternative construction technique used throughout the industrial world is that of the
terminal strip. Terminal strips, alternatively called barrier strips or terminal blocks, are com-
prised of a length of nonconducting material with several small bars of metal embedded within.
Each metal bar has at least one machine screw or other fastener under which a wire or compo-
nent lead may be secured. Multiple wires fastened by one screw are made electrically common
to each other, as are wires fastened to multiple screws on the same bar. The following photo-
graph shows one style of terminal strip, with a few wires attached.
