Equations (24.45) and (24.46) predict reduction of response times by reduction in channel length L. Decreas-
ing oxide thickness leads to no improvement in tG, but Eq. (24.46) shows a possibility of improvement in tD,
because CD is independent of d while CG increases as d decreases. The ring oscillator, a closed loop of an odd
number of inverters, is a test circuit whose performance depends primarily on tG and tD . Gate delay/stage for
ring oscillators is found to be near 12 ps/stage at 0.1 mm channel length, and 60 ps/stage at 0.5 mm.
