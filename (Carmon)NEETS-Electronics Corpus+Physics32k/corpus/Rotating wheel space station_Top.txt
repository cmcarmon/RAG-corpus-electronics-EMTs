A rotating wheel space station is a hypothetical wheel-shaped space station that rotates about its axis, thus creating an environment of artificial gravity. Occupants of the station would experience centripetal acceleration according to the following equation,




a
=
−

ω

2


r


{\displaystyle a=-\omega ^{2}r}

where



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the angular velocity of the station,



r


{\displaystyle r}
is its radius, and



a


{\displaystyle a}
is linear acceleration at any point along its perimeter.
In principle, the station could be configured to simulate the gravitational acceleration of Earth (9.81 m/s2).
