For a particle with electrical charge q, its electrical mobility μq is related to its generalized mobility μ by the equation μ=μq/q. The parameter μq is the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied electric field. Hence, the equation in the case of a charged particle is given as

Here, T is electron temperature in plasma.
