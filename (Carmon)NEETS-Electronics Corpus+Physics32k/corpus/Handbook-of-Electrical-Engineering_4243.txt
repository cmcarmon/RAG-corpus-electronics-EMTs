where  r  is  the  single-target  track  rate,  Nt  is  the  number  of  targets  under  track  in  different  beams, sq  is  the
required angle accuracy standard deviation (radians), and s is the RCS. In general, a phased array radar antenna
is required to support multiple target tracking when Nt > 1.
