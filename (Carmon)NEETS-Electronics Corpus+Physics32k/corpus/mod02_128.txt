 SELF-INDUCTANCEâ€”The process by which a circuit induces an emf into itself by its own 
moving magnetic field. All electrical circuits possess self-inductance. This opposition (inductance), 
however, only takes place when there is a change in current. Inductance does NOT oppose current, only a 
CHANGE in current. The property of inductance can be increased by forming the conductor into a loop. 
In a loop, the magnetic lines of force affect more of the conductor at one time. This increases the self-
induced emf.
