A special type of decoder is the standard 8421 
BCD-to-seven-segment decoder. It accepts a BCD 
input code and generates a special 7-bit output code 
to energize a seven-segment decimal readout display 
 (Figure 45-7). The display consists of seven LED seg-
ments that are lit in different combinations to produce 
each of the 10 decimal digits, 0 through 9 (Figure  45-8). 
Besides seven-segment LED displays, there are incan-
descent and liquid crystal (LCD) displays.
