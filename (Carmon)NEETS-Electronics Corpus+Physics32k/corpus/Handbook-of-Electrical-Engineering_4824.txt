The averaged longitudinal and transverse electrostriction coefﬁcients have been measured for poled ceramic
PMN to be Q33 ~ 2.3 · 10–2 m4/C2, Q13 ~ –0.64 · 10–2 m4/C2. The corresponding ﬁeld-related coefﬁcients are
M33 ~ 1.50 · 10–16 m2/V2 and M13 ~ –4.19 · 10–17 m2/V2. Induced strains of the order of 10–4 may be achieved
with moderate electric ﬁelds of ~40 kV/cm. These strains are much larger than thermal expansion strains, and
are in fact equivalent to thermal expansion strains induced by a temperature change of ~1000(cid:176)C. M33 values
for some other common ferroelectrics and a PVDF copolymer are listed in Table 50.1.
