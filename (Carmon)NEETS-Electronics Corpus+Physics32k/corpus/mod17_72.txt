Each unit is assigned an identifying number. This number begins with the number 1 and runs 
consecutively for all units of a system or a set. Let's look back at the radio transmitting set AN/URT-xx 
with the unit numbers 1, 2, 3 on figure 1-4. You should note that these units may also have an AN 
nomenclature, such as T-xxx/URT. The T indicates the equipment is a transmitter. The xxx would be 
replaced by 3 digits that indicate the model number.
