Precise measurements of electrical charge were carried out by the French physicist Charles
Coulomb in the 1780’s using a device called a torsional balance measuring the force generated
between two electrically charged objects. The results of Coulomb’s work led to the development
of a unit of electrical charge named in his honor, the coulomb. If two ”point” objects (hypotheti-
cal objects having no appreciable surface area) were equally charged to a measure of 1 coulomb,
and placed 1 meter (approximately 1 yard) apart, they would generate a force of about 9 billion
newtons (approximately 2 billion pounds), either attracting or repelling depending on the types
of charges involved. The operational deﬁnition of a coulomb as the unit of electrical charge (in
terms of force generated between point charges) was found to be equal to an excess or deﬁciency
of about 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. Or, stated in reverse terms, one electron has a
charge of about 0.00000000000000000016 coulombs. Being that one electron is the smallest
known carrier of electric charge, this last ﬁgure of charge for the electron is deﬁned as the
elementary charge.
