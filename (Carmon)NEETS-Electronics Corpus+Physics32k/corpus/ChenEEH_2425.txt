Equation 6.109 is a useful universal relationship between the
transmit and receive vectors of any antenna.
G  Aem Relationship
Consider now the relationship between the magnitudes of the
transmit and receive vectors in equation 6.109. Then use equa-
tion 6.63 to relate jeej to G and equation 6.83 to relate jjvRj to
maximum effective area Aem. Thus, an equivalent universal
relationship between G(u, f) and Aem(u, f) results:
