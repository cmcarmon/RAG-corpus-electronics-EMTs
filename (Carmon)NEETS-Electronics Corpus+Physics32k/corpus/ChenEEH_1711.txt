The HSV color space is used because it is perceptually closer to
human vision as compared to the RGB space. The three histo-
grams corresponding to the three channels (hue, saturation,
and value) are then combined into one vector of dimension 36.
Texture is represented by gray-level co-occurrence matrices at
four orientations. Shape is captured by moment invariants.
A similar approach proposed by Shih-Fu Chang et al. (1998)
uses quantized CIEâ€“LUV space as the color feature, three
Tamura texture measures (coarseness, contrast, and orientation)
as texture feature, and shape components and motion vectors.
All these features are extracted from objects detected and tracked
in video sequence after spatiotemporal segmentation.
