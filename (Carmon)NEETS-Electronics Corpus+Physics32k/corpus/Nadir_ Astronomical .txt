The term nadir can also be used to represent the lowest point reached by a celestial body during its apparent orbit around a given point of observation. This can be used to describe the location of the Sun, but it is only technically accurate for one latitude at a time and only possible at the low latitudes. The sun is said to be at the nadir at a location when it is at the zenith at the location's antipode and the sun is 90 degrees below the horizon. This only occurs between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn at solar midnight. The tropic circles experience this once a year on their winter solstices and all other tropical regions experience this twice.
