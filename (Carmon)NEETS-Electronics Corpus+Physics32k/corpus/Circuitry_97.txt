Variable resistors 
 
Variable  resistors  are  available  in  several  forms 
including those which use carbon tracks and those 
which  use  a  wirewound  resistance  element.  In 
either case, a moving slider makes contact with the 
resistance  element.  Most  variable  resistors  have 
three  (rather  than  two)  terminals  and  as  such  are 
more  correctly  known  as  potentiometers. Carbon 
potentiometers  are  available  with  linear  or  semi-
logarithmic law tracks (see Fig. 2.19) and in rotary 
or slider formats. Ganged controls, in which several 
potentiometers  are  linked  together  by  a  common 
control shaft, are also available. Figure 2.20 shows 
a selection of variable resistors. 
  You will also encounter various forms of preset 
resistors 
to  make  occasional 
adjustments (e.g. for calibration). Various forms of 
preset  resistor  are  commonly  used  including  open 
carbon 
fully  
encapsulated carbon and multi-turn cermet types, as 
shown in Fig. 2.21.
