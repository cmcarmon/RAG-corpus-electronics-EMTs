As electric current is conducted through a material, any opposition to that ﬂow of electrons
(resistance) results in a dissipation of energy, usually in the form of heat. This is the most basic
and easy-to-understand effect of electricity on living tissue: current makes it heat up. If the
amount of heat generated is sufﬁcient, the tissue may be burnt. The effect is physiologically
the same as damage caused by an open ﬂame or other high-temperature source of heat, except
that electricity has the ability to burn tissue well beneath the skin of a victim, even burning
internal organs.
