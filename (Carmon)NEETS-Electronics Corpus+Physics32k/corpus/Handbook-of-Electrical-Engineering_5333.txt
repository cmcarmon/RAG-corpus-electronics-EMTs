Solar Cell Operation and Characteristics
The basic operation of  a solar cell is shown in Fig. 60.4. Photons of  light are absorbed by the semiconductor
material  and  each  photon  that  is  absorbed  generates  an  electron-hole  pair.  The  generated  minority  carriers
diffuse to the junction where they are collected. The number of collected carriers determines the current. The
voltage is determined by the junction characteristics. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 60.5. The charac-
teristic curve of the photovoltaic solar cell can be determined by ﬁrst calculating the collected minority carriers
and then separately calculating the current–voltage characteristic of the diode. Superposition can be used to
combine them.
