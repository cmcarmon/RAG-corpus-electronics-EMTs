Toggle torque wrenches (friction-style) and beam wrenches (spring-style) are the most common types in dentistry as manual mechanical torque-limiting devices. Beam type wrenches in general are more consistent to its calibration than toggle types. The beam types with a dial indicator are the most precise to set the Tare torque (zero point reset). Because steam sterilization processes like an autoclave are applied to the dental torque wrenches and the length of time in use presents stress on the material, fatigue can occur.
