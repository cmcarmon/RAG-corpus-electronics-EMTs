The experiments suggested by Newton are too imprecise to measure an absolute rotation, if any, of the Earth. French physicist Georges Sagnac conducted an experiment that was similar to the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment, but was intended to observe the effects of rotation. The Sagnac experiment and later similar experiments showed that a stationary object on the surface of the Earth will rotate once every rotation of the Earth when using stars as a stationary reference point. Rotation was thus concluded to be absolute rather than relative.
