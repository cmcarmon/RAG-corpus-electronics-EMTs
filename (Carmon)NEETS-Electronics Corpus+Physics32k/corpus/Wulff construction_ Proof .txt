Various proofs of the theorem have been given by Hilton, Liebman, Laue, Herring, and a rather extensive treatment by Cerf. The following is after the method of R. F. Strickland-Constable. We begin with the surface energy for a crystal




Δ

γ

O

j






{\displaystyle \Delta G_{i}=\sum _{j}\gamma _{j}O_{j}\,\!}

which is the product of the surface energy per unit area times the area of each face, summed over all faces. This is minimized for a given volume when

{\displaystyle \delta \sum _{j}\gamma _{j}O_{j}=\sum _{j}\gamma _{j}\delta O_{j}=0\,\!}

We then consider a small change in shape for a constant volume

{\displaystyle \delta V_{c}={\frac {1}{3}}\delta \sum _{j}h_{j}O_{j}=0}
,
which can be written as

{\displaystyle \sum _{j}h_{j}\delta O_{j}+\sum _{j}O_{j}\delta h_{j}=0\,\!}
.
The second term must be zero, as it represents the change in volume [which does not make sense, as before the whole expression was supposed to be the change in volume(comments:This term means the insider energy remains constant, which in simplist assumption, the inner atoms or units have same energy. This term also can be interpreted as that surface area is constant)] and we wish only to find the lowest surface energy at a constant volume (i.e., without adding or removing material). We are then given from above

{\displaystyle \sum _{j}h_{j}\delta O_{j}=0\,\!}

and





∑

{\displaystyle \sum _{j}\gamma _{j}\delta O_{j}=0\,\!}

which can be combined by a constant of proportionality as

{\displaystyle \sum _{j}(h_{i}-\lambda \gamma _{j})\delta O_{j}=0\,\!}

The change in shape

{\displaystyle (\delta O_{j})}
must be allowed to be arbitrary, which then requires that

{\displaystyle h_{j}=\lambda \gamma _{j}}
, which then proves Gibbs-Wulff Theorem.
