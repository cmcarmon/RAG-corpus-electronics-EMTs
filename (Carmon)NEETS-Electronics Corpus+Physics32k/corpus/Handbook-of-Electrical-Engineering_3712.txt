Taking into account the head ﬁeld gradients, the nonlinear M-H loop characteristics of the medium and the
demagnetizing ﬁelds, Williams and Comstock [1971] developed a model for the recording process. This model
predicts the width of a recorded transition, in a material with a square hysteresis loop, to be
