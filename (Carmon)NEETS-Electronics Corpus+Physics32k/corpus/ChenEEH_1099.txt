Because materials go hand in hand with the processes for
producing and modifying them, the range of processes for
making MEMS has also widened far beyond those found in
the IC industry. There is something more fundamental at
work, however, when it comes to processes for making
MEMS. Integrated circuits are monolithic, and, despite having
30 layers in some cases, are made by largely two-dimensional
(2-D) thin ﬁlm processes that yield what some people call
2.5-D structures. By contrast, micromechanical devices must
have space between their parts so they can move, and the
dimension perpendicular to the substrate is often very funda-
mentally necessary for their performance. Development of
processes to make micrometer-scale parts that can move rela-
tive to each other was the breakthrough that enabled MEMS.
Such micromachining processes fall into three major categor-
ies, which are now reviewed brieﬂy:
