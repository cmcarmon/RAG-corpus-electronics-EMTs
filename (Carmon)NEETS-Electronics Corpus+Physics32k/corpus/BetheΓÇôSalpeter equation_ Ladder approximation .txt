In principle the interaction kernel K contains all possible two-particle-irreducible interactions that can occur between the two constituents. Thus, in practical calculations one has to model it and only choose a subset of the interactions. As in quantum field theories, interaction is described via the exchange of particles (e.g. photons in quantum electrodynamics, or gluons in quantum chromodynamics), the most simple interaction is the exchange of only one of these force-particles.
As the Betheâ€“Salpeter equation sums up the interaction infinitely many times, the resulting Feynman graph has the form of a ladder.
While in quantum electrodynamics the ladder approximation caused problems with crossing symmetry and gauge invariance and thus crossed ladder terms had to be included, in quantum chromodynamics this approximation is used phenomenologically quite a lot to calculate hadron masses, since it respects Chiral symmetry breaking and therefore is an important part of the generation of these masses.
