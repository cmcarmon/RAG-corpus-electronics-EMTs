Magnetically soft alloys of metals such as Permalloy (NiFe) and Sendust (FeAlSi) have saturation magneti-
zations on the order of 800 kA/m, about twice that of ferrites, but because they are metallic may suffer from
eddy current losses when operated at high frequencies. To overcome the limitations imposed by eddy currents,
they  are  used  in  layers  thinner  than  a  skin  depth  at  their  operating  frequency.  To  prevent  saturation  of  the
ferrite  heads,  the  high  magnetization  metals  are  applied  to  the  pole  faces  of  the  ferrite,  making  a  so-called
metal-in-gap or MiG recording head, as shown in Fig. 36.12. Since the corners of the pole faces are the ﬁrst
parts  of  a  ferrite  head  to  saturate,  the  high  magnetization  metals  enable  these  MiG  heads  to  be  operated  to
nearly twice the ﬁeld to which a ferrite head can be operated. Because the layer of metal is thin, it can furthermore
be less than a skin depth, and eddy current losses do not limit performance at high frequencies.
