The astable multivibrator 
 
Figure  9.6  shows  a  classic  form  of  astable 
multivibrator  based  on  two  transistors.  Figure  9.7 
shows  how  this  circuit  can  be  redrawn  in  an 
arrangement  that  more  closely  resembles  a  two-
stage  common-emitter  amplifier  with  its  output 
connected back to its input. In Fig. 9.5, the values 
of the base resistors, R3 and R4, axe such that the 
sufficient  base  current  will  be  available 
to 
completely  saturate  the  respective  transistor.  The 
values  of  the  collector  load  resistors,  R1 and  R2, 
are  very  much  smaller  than  R3 and  R4.  When 
power  is  first  applied  to  the  circuit,  assume  that 
TR2 saturates before TR1  when the power is first 
applied  (in  practice  one  transistor  would  always 
saturate  before  the  other  due  to  variations  in 
component tolerances and transistor parameters). 
  As  TR2  saturates,  its  collector  voltage  will  fall 
rapidly from +VCC to 0 V. This drop in voltage will 
be  transferred  to  the  base  of  TR1  via  C1.  This 
negative-going  voltage  will  ensure  that  TR1  is 
initially placed in the non-conducting state. As long 
as  TR1  remains  cut  off,  TR2  will  continue  to  be 
saturated. During this time, C1 will charge via R4
