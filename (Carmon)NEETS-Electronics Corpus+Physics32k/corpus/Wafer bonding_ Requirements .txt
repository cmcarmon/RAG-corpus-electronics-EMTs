The bonding of wafers requires specific environmental conditions which can generally be defined as follows:
substrate surface
flatness
smoothness
cleanliness

bonding environment
bond temperature
ambient pressure
applied force

materials
substrate materials
intermediate layer materials

The actual bond is an interaction of all those conditions and requirements. Hence, the applied technology needs to be chosen in respect to the present substrate and defined specification like max. bearable temperature, mechanical pressure or desired gaseous atmosphere.
