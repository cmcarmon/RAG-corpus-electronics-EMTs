The VARACTOR, or varicap, as the schematic drawing in figure 3-11 suggests, is a diode that 
behaves like a variable capacitor, with the PN junction functioning like the dielectric and plates of a 
common capacitor. Understanding how the varactor operates is an important prerequisite to understanding 
field-effect transistors, which will be covered later in this topic.
