Explanation: Although its complicated to explain, some materials offer less opposition to
ﬁeld ﬂux for a given amount of ﬁeld force. Materials with a greater permittivity allow for more
ﬁeld ﬂux (offer less opposition), and thus a greater collected charge, for any given amount of
ﬁeld force (applied voltage).
