The deflection of the pointer of an ohmmeter is controlled by the amount of battery current passing
through the moving coil. Before you can measure the resistance of an unknown resistor or electrical
circuit, you must calibrate the ohmmeter to be used. If the value of resistance to be measured can be
estimated within reasonable limits, select a range on the ohmmeter that will give approximately half-scale
deflection when the resistance is inserted between the probes. If you cannot estimate the resistance to be
measured, then set the range switch on the highest scale. Whatever range you select, the meter must be
calibrated to read zero before the unknown resistance is measured.
