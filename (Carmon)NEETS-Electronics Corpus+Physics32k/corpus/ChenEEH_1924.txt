RESO is essentially triple-time redundancy, it is much slower
than REMOD although it has a small advantage in area over-
head. TMR is very fast, but REMOD has a signiÔ¨Åcant advantage
in area, and with similar area overhead REMOD can even
tolerate three faults. Partitioned TMR is most comparable to
1-FT REMOD in terms of overhead, with both of these tech-
niques having area overheads of about 100 to 150% and time
overheads of 10 to 30%. The big advantage of REMOD, however,
is that it can be extended to tolerate multiple sequential faults.
