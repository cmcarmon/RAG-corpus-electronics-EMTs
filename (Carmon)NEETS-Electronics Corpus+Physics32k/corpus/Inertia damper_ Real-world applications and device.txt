Inertial compensators are also used in simulators or rides, making them more realistic by creating artificial sensations of acceleration and other movement. The Disneyland ride Space Tours is a fair example of this principle.
There are many types of physical devices that can act as inertia dampers:
Ballast
Brakes - kinetic energy redirected as heating due to friction between surfaces pressed together
Counterweight - a mass which by mechanical means is caused to move in opposition to the motion of some other mass, partially negating forces such as gravity, that are acting upon the primary mass
Dogbone damper - absorbs resonant wave motions in wire and support cables
Flywheel - rotational forces
Pendulum - oscillatory forces
Shock absorber - motion redirected as heating of viscous oil forced through a restrictive passage
Rotary damper - rotary motion is dissipated as heat in a highly viscous fluid or gel. May use a smooth surface rotating cylinder and a smooth surface stationary interior wall with fluid/gel between. For more forceful motion absorption and higher surface area, a paddle wheel or toothed gear is used, with a similarly ribbed or studded stationary interior wall to more forcefully grip the fluid/gel.
