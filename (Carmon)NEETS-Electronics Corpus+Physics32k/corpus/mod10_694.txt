The use of highly directional arrays as radiators from the transmitters tends to solve the problem. The 
signals are beamed along the paths of the solid arrows and provide very low radiation along the paths of 
the broken arrows. Further improvement along these lines is obtained by the use of narrowly directed 
arrays as receiving antennas. The effect of this arrangement is to select the desired signal while 
discriminating against all other signals. This same approach can be used to overcome other types of 
radiated interference. In such cases, preventing radiation in certain directions is more important than 
producing greater gain in other directions.
