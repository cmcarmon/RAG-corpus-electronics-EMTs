The  satellite  performance  data  indicate  a  wide  range  of  variation  in  the  speciﬁcations  among  the  various
satellites. Most satellites have a design lifetime of 10 years. The newer GEO satellites tend to have an extended
life of 12–15 years. Most domestic U.S. satellites have 24 transponders. The older generation of Asian satellites
have  very  few  transponders  per  satellite.  Some  planned  satellites  will  have  a  large  number  of  transponders.
Nominal transponder bandwidths include 36, 54, and 72 MHz.
