A6. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
A7. When the wave is nearly parallel to the reflecting surface.
A8. When the wave is perpendicular to the reflecting surface.
A9. The law of reflection.
A10. Depends on the bending caused by the velocity difference of the wave traveling through different
