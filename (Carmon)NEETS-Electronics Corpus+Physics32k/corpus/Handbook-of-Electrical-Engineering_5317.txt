and  an 
n
-type  material  to  cumulate  the  effects  around  a  thermoelectric  circuit.  Moreover,  by  using  solid
solutions  of  tellurides  and  selenides  doped  to  result  in  a  low  density  of  charge  carriers,  relatively  moderate
thermal conductivities and reasonably good electrical conductivities can be achieved.
