This algorithm has the advantage that it is simple to program, while, on the other hand, its disadvantage lies
in the fact that it has poor disturbance rejection properties in that if an is made large enough for good disturbance
rejection, the closed-loop system can be unstable (i.e., have transient responses which increase with time). Since
the object is to regulate the system output in a known way, these unbounded responses preclude this regulation.
