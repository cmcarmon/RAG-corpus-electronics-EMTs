Let us illustrate the method by considering the simple, but typical, example shown in Figure
2.2.1. By replacing the voltage sources with series resistances by their equivalent current sources
with shunt conductances, Figure 2.2.1 is redrawn as Figure 2.2.2, in which one can identify three
nodes, A, B, and O.
