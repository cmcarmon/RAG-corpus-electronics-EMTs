Multi-band  coders  perform  a  similar  function  by  characterizing  the  contributions  of  individual  sinusoidal
components to the short-term speech spectrum. These parameters are then quantized, coded, transmitted, and
used to conﬁgure a bank of tuned oscillators at the receiver. Outputs of the oscillators are mixed in proportion
to the distribution of spectral energy present in the original waveform. An important requirement of multi-band
coders is a capability to precisely determine perceptually signiﬁcant spectral components and track the evolution
of their energy and phase. Recent developments related to multi-band coding emphasize the use of harmonically
related components with carefully intermixed spectral regions of bandlimited white noise. Sinusoidal Transform
Coders (STC) and Multi-Band Excitation coders (MBE) are examples of this type of frequency domain coders.
