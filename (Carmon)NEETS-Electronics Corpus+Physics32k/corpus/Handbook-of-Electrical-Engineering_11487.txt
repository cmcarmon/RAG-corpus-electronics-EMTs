The trend of converting hospitals into “paperless hospitals” is becoming one of the most important topics
of the 1990s. In 1970, chartered by the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine working under
the Policy Matters for Public Health has actively pursued the creation of a computer-based record (CBR). In
July of 1991 a book was published by the Institute of Medicine in regards to the CBR. The requirements to
compile an all-digital medical record (ADMR)will require ways to combine data, graphics, voice, signals, and
images, both clinical and document. The architecture that will accommodate all these forms of information
for capturing, storing, communicating, and displaying is extremely complex. Some of the technologies involved
include optical ﬁbers, LANs, compact/optical disks, bedside terminals, medical image display stations, image
diagnostic workstations, and picture archival and communications systems to name a few.
