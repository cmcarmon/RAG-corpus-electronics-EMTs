Transformer Core
The transformer core is the medium that enables the transfer of power from the primary to the secondary to
occur in a transformer. In order that the transformation of power may occur with the least amount of loss, the
magnetic core is made up of laminations which have the highest permeability, permeability being a measure
of the ease with which the magnetic Ô¨Åeld is set up in the core.
