A generator that has only one or two armature loops has high ripple voltage. This results in too little 
current to be of any practical use. To increase the amount of current output, a number of loops of wire are 
used. These additional loops do away with most of the ripple. The loops of wire, called windings, are 
evenly spaced around the armature so that the distance between each winding is the same.
