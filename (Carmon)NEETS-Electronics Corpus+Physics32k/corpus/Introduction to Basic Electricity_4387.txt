electronics, not only in computers but also in 
applications such as measurement, automatic 
control, robotics, and in situations requiring decisions. 
All of these applications require complex switching 
circuits that are formed from the five basic logic gates: 
the AND, OR, NAND, and NOR gates and the inverter.
The significant point about these logic gates is that 
they only have two operating conditions. They are 
 either ON (1) or OFF (0). When logic gates are inter-
connected to form more complex circuits, it is neces-
sary to obtain the simplest circuit possible.
