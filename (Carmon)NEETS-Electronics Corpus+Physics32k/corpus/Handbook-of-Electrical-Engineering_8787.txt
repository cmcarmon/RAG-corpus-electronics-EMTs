Compiler: A computer program that translates the source program statements of a high-level language into
lower-leveled object program statements. Compilers differ from interpreters in that they do not imme-
diately perform the operations speciÔ¨Åed in the source program. Instead, a compiler produces an object
program that in turn performs the intended operations when it is run.
