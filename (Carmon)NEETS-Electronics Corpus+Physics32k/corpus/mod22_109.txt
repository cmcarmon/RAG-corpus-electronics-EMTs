Floppy disks (fig. 1-13) are one means by which you will store data (files that you create) either 
directly or in backing up the data you store on hard (or fixed) disk. For this reason, and because floppy 
disks are extremely fragile, you should follow certain guidelines to ensure their proper care and handling. 
This includes properly labeling and backing up disks.
