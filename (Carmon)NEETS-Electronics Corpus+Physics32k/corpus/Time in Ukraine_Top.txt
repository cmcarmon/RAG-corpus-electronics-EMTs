Time in Ukraine is defined as UTC+02:00 and in summer as UTC+03:00. Locally it is referred to as the Kiev Time (Ukrainian: Київський час, Kyivskyi chas) and is part of the Eastern European Time. The change for the summer time take place in the last week of March at 03:00 when the time changes an hour ahead and the last week of October at 04:00 when the time changes an hour back; this way the clocks in Ukraine are 1 hour ahead of those in central Europe at all times.
