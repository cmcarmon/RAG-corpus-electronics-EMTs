ANGLE OF INCLINATION.â€”The ANGLE OF INCLINATION (angle between the equatorial 
plane of the earth and the orbital plane of the satellite) is the third parameter used to describe the orbit 
data of a satellite. Figure 4-3 depicts the angle of inclination between the equatorial plane and the orbital 
plane. Most satellites orbit the earth in orbital planes that do not coincide with the equatorial plane of the 
earth. A satellite orbiting in any plane not identical with the equatorial plane is in an INCLINED ORBIT.
