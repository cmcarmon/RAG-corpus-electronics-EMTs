A parallel port is an interface for a computer to communi-
cate peripherals in parallel manner. Data are transferred in or
out in parallel, that is, on more than one wire. A parallel port
carries 1 bit on each wire, thus multiplying the transfer rate
obtainable over a single wire. There will usually be some
control signals on the port that indicate when data are ready
to be sent or received. The most common type of parallel port
is a printer port (e.g., a Centronics port that transfers 8 bits at a
time). Disks are also connected via special parallel ports (e.g.,
SCSI or IDE).
