However, as feature sizes have decreased below about 0.5 mm, this condition has changed and current VLSI
technology  has  interconnection  delays  substantially  larger  than  logic  delays.  The  increasing  importance  of
interconnection  delays  is  driven  by  several  effects.  The  smaller  feature  size  leads  to  interconnections  with  a
higher resistance R* per unit length and with a higher capacitance C* per unit area (the capacitance increase
also reﬂecting additional metal layers and coupling capacitances). For interconnection lines among high-level
blocks  (spanning  the  IC),  the  result  is  a  larger  RC  time  constant  (R*LC ·  *L),  with  L  the  line  length. While
interconnect delays are increasing, gate delays are decreasing. Figure 25.26 illustrates the general behavior on
technology scaling to smaller features. A logic function F in a previous-generation technology requires a smaller
physical area and has a higher speed in a later, scaled technology (i.e., a technology with feature sizes decreased).
Although  the  intrablock  line  lengths  decrease  (relaxing  the  impact  within  the  block  of  higher  R*C*),  the
interblock  lines  continue  to  have  lengths  proportional  to  the  overall  IC  size  (which  is  increasing),  with  the
larger R*C* leading to increased RC delays on such interconnections.
