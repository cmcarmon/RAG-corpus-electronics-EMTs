The  ac  ripple  current  rating  is  very  important  in  Ô¨Ålter  applications  because  excessive  current  produces
temperature  rise,  shortening  capacitor  life.  The  maximum  permissible  rms  ripple  current  is  limited  by  the
internal  temperature  and  the  rate  of  heat  dissipation  from  the  capacitor.  Lower  ESR  and  longer  enclosures
increase the ripple current rating.
