Although Newton states that the problem was to be solved by Proposition 6, he does not use it explicitly. In the following, simplified proof, Proposition 6 is used to show how the result is derived.
Newton’s detailed proof follows that, and finally Proposition 6 is appended, as it is not well-known.
Proposition 44 uses Proposition 6 to prove a result about revolving orbits. In the propositions following Proposition 6 in Section 2 of the Principia, he applies it to specific curves, for example, conic sections. In the case of Proposition 44, it is applied to any orbit, under the action of an arbitrary force directed towards a fixed point, to produce a corresponding revolving orbit.
In Fig. 1. MN is part of that orbit. At point P, the body moves to Q under the action of a force directed towards S, as before. The force, F(SP) is defined at each point P on the curve.
In Fig.2, the corresponding part of the revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume that initially, the body in the static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.
Let SA be the initial direction of the static orbit, and sa, that of the revolving orbit. If after a certain time the bodies in the respective orbits are at P and p, then the ratio of the angles

The figure pryx and the arc py in Fig. 2 is the figure PRQT and the arc PQ in Fig. 1, expanded linearly in the horizontal direction in the ratio v / V, so that

{\displaystyle qt={\frac {v.QT}{V}}}
. The straight lines qt and QT should really be circular arcs with centres s and S and radii sq and SQ respectively. In the limit, their ratio becomes





v
V




{\displaystyle {\frac {v}{V}}}
, whether they are straight lines or arcs.
Since in the limit the forces are parallel to SP and sp, if the same force acted on the body in Fig. 2 as in Fig. 1, the body would arrive at y, since ry = RQ. The difference in horizontal speed does not affect the vertical distances. Newton refers to Corollary 2 of the Laws of Motion where the motion of the bodies is resolved into a component in the radial direction acted on by the whole force, and the other component transverse to it, acted on by no force.
However, the distance from y to the centre, s is now greater than SQ, so an additional force is required to move the body to q such that sq = SQ. The extra force is represented by yq, and f is proportional to ry + yq, just as F is to RQ.

In Fig. 3 at the initial point A of the static curve, draw the tangent AR, which is perpendicular to SA and the circle AQD which just touches the curve at A. Let ρ be the radius of that circle. Since angle SAR is a right-angle, the centre of the circle lies on SA. From the property of a circle:

{\displaystyle F(SA)={\frac {k}{(2\rho .SA^{2})}}}

And since F(SA) is given, this determines the constant k. However, Newton wants the force at A, to be of the form c.V2 / SA2 where c is a constant so that

The expression for f(sp) above is the same as Newton’s in Corollary 4 of Proposition 44, except that he uses different letters. He writes





G
F


=


v
V




{\displaystyle {\frac {G}{F}}={\frac {v}{V}}}
(where G and F are not necessarily equal to v and V respectively), and uses the letter “V” for the constant corresponding to “c”, and the letter “X” for the function F(sp).
The above geometric proof shows very clearly where the additional force arises from to make the orbit revolve with respect to the static orbit.
