The Minister also made observations about the strengthening of existing regulatory requirements provided for in the Bill -

"The existing probity requirements in the Transport Act for accident towing licences and tow-truck driver authorities have been transferred to the new accreditation schemes thus ensuring that there is no reduction of these standards in the industry. Accreditation will help provide assurance that accident towing operators and depot managers are of suitable character and can meet service standards for complaints handling and (that) tow-truck drivers are of suitable character and are competent to tow damaged motor vehicles away from crash scenes."
