A power system must generate sufﬁcient power at all times to
meet the load demand from the grid. The amount of load
connected to the system varies signiﬁcantly based on seasonal
and time-of-day considerations. The cost of producing power
at different generators also varies
to plant,
depending on the efﬁciency of plant design and fuel costs at
the generator location. Therefore,
it is not economical to
divide the required generation capacity arbitrarily among
the available generators. The problem of determining how the
