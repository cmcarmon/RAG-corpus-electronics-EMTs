Further reﬁnements can be added to a load ﬂow program to make it give more realistic results. Transformer
on-load tap changers, voltage limits, active and reactive power limits, plus control of the voltage magnitudes
at buses other than the local bus help to bring the results close to reality. Application of these limits can slow
down convergence.
