In geometry, a position or position vector, also known as location vector or radius vector, is a Euclidean vector that represents the position of a point P in space in relation to an arbitrary reference origin O. Usually denoted x, r, or s, it corresponds to the straight-line distances along each axis from O to P:

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r} }={\overrightarrow {OP}}.}

The term "position vector" is used mostly in the fields of differential geometry, mechanics and occasionally vector calculus.
Frequently this is used in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, but can be easily generalized to Euclidean spaces in any number of dimensions.
