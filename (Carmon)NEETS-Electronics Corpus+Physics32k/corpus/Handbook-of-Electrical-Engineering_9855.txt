Lag-Lead Network Design
The prime purpose of a lead network is to add phase lead near the crossover frequency to increase the PM.
Accompanied  with  this  phase  lead  is  a  gain  increase  that  will  increase  the  crossover  frequency.  This  will
sometimes cause difÔ¨Åculties if there is much phase lag in the uncompensated system at high frequencies. There
may be situations where use of a phase-lead network to achieve a given PM is not possible due to too many
high-frequency poles.
