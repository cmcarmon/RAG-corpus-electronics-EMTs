f all the new technologies to emerge from World War II, none was to have such profound and
pervasive impacts as the digital computer. As early as the 1830s, the Englishman Charles Babbage
conceived  of  an  “Analytical  Engine”  that  would  perform  mathematical  operations  using
punched cards, hundreds of gears, and steam power. Babbage’s idea was beyond the capabilities of 19th-
century technology, but his vision represented a goal that many were to pursue in the next century and
a half.
