In this figure the signal from TX No. 1 rotates the resultant TDR stator field 75ยบ counterclockwise. In 
a similar manner, the signal from TX No. 2 rotates the resultant TDR rotor field counterclockwise 30ยบ. 
Since the two resultant fields are not rotated by equal amounts, a torque is exerted on the rotor to bring 
the two fields into alignment. This torque causes the rotor to turn to 45ยบ, the point at which the two fields 
are aligned. To bring the two fields into alignment, the TDR rotor need turn only through an angle equal 
to the difference between the signals supplied by the two TXs.
