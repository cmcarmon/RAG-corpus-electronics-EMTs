At all even numbered quarter-wavelength points from the short circuit, the impedance is extremely
low. When the frequency of the voltage applied to the line is varied, the impedance at these points
increases just as the impedance of a series-resonant circuit varies when the frequency applied to it is
changed. The same is true for an open-ended line (figure 3-31, view B) except that the points of high and
low impedance are reversed.
