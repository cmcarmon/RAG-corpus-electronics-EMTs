â€¢ A Kelvin Double bridge is a variant of the Wheatstone bridge used for measuring very low
resistances. Its additional complexity over the basic Wheatstone design is necessary for
avoiding errors otherwise incurred by stray resistances along the current path between
the low-resistance standard and the resistance being measured.
