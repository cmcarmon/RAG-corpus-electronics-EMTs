Even if two stations produce identical beat frequencies, they can be separated by adjusting the
local-oscillator or BEAT-FREQUENCY OSCILLATOR (bfo) frequency. For example, if the second
station in the previous example had been operating at 10,002,000 hertz, then both stations would have
produced a 1,000-hertz beat frequency and interference would have occurred. Adjusting the
local-oscillator frequency to 9,999,000 hertz would have caused the desired station at 10,000,000 hertz to
produce a 1,000-hertz beat frequency. The other station, at 10,002,000 hertz, would have produced a beat
frequency of 3,000 hertz. Either selective circuits or the operator can easily distinguish between these
widely differing tones. A trained operator can use the variable local oscillator to distinguish between
stations that vary in frequency by only a few hundred hertz.
