Since k is a physical constant of proportionality between temperature and energy, its numerical value depends on the choice of units for energy and temperature. The small numerical value of the Boltzmann constant in SI units means a change in temperature by 1 K only changes a particle's energy by a small amount. A change of 1 °C is defined to be the same as a change of 1 K. The characteristic energy kT is a term encountered in many physical relationships.
The Boltzmann constant sets up a relationship between wavelength and temperature (dividing hc/k by a wavelength gives a temperature) with one micrometer being related to 14 387.770 K, and also a relationship between voltage and temperature (multiplying the voltage by k in units of eV/K) with one volt being related to 11 604.519 K. The ratio of these two temperatures, 14 387.770 K/11 604.519 K ≈ 1.239842, is the numerical value of hc in units of eV⋅μm.
