4. Reenergize the circuit. Start with a high scale on the meter and work down to the 0- to 5-volt 
scale to protect the meter movement. At the same time, turn the differential's stator until you 
obtain a zero or minimum voltage reading. Clamp the differential stator in position, ensuring the 
voltage reading does not change. This is the fine electrical zero position of the differential.
