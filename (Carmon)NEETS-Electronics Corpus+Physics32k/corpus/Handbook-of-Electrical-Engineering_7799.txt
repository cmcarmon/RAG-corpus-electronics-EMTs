Modulation codes may be used to enhance the capacity beyond what has been described so far. Modulation
coding does not modify the minimum mark length of D0, but frees the longer marks from the constraint of
being integer multiples of D0. The use of this type of code results in more efÔ¨Åcient data storage and an effective
number  of  bits  per  D0  that  is  greater  than  unity.  For  example,  the  popular  (2,  7)  modulation  code  has  an
effective bit density of 1.5 bits per D0. This or any other modulation code can increase the disk capacity beyond
the estimate of Eq. (80.7).
