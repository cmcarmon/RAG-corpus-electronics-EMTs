14 DEGAUSS When this button is pressed, current through the local oscillator system is reduced
to zero in order to minimize magnetism build-up around the LOs. This is done to
enhance the center frequency display and amplitude accuracy. You should do this
after every significant frequency change and before calibrating the center
frequency.
