forward
voltage
 drop in thyristors is about 1.5 to 2 V, and even at higher currents of the order of 1000 A, it seldom
exceeds 3 V. While the forward voltage determines the on-state power loss of the device at any given current,
the  switching  power  loss  becomes  a  dominating  factor  affecting  the  device  junction  temperature  at  high
operating frequencies. Because of this, the maximum switching frequencies possible using thyristors are limited
in comparison with other power devices considered in this section.
