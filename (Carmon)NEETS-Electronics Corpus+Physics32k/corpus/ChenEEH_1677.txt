Most of the segmentation methods discussed in image pro-
cessing and analysis literature are automatic. A major advan-
tage of this type of segmentation algorithms is that it can
extract boundaries from a large number of images without
occupying the userâ€™s time and effort. However, in an uncon-
strained domain, for nonpreconditioned images, which is the
case with image CBIR systems, the automatic segmentation
is not always reliable. What an algorithm can segment in this
case is only regions and not objects. To obtain high-level
objects, human assistance is almost always needed for reliable
segmentation.
