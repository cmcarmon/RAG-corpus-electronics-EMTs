The  hydro  plants’  ancestors  are  water  wheels  used  for  pumping  stations,  mill  driving,  etc.  Water-driven

commercial use. However, most of the sites that can be developed economically are currently being utilized.
No signiﬁcant new development is expected in the United States in the near future.
