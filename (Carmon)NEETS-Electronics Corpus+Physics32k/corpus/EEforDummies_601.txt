Bipolar junction transistors
One of the first transistors to be invented was the bipolar junction transistor 
(BJT), and BJTs are what most hobbyists use in home‐brewed circuits. BJTs 
consist of two pn‐junctions fused together to form a three‐layer sandwich‐like 
structure. As Chapter 9 explains, a pn‐junction is the boundary between two 
different types of semiconductors: a P‐type semiconductor, which contains 
positive charge carriers (known as holes), and an N‐type semiconductor, 
which contains negative charge carriers (electrons).
