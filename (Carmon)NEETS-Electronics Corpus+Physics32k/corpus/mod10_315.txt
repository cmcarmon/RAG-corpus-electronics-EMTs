When propagation is accomplished via multihop refraction, rf energy is lost each time the radio wave 
is reflected from the Earth's surface. The amount of energy lost depends on the frequency of the wave, the 
angle of incidence, ground irregularities, and the electrical conductivity of the point of reflection.
