Method of moments: A general technique for reducing integral, differential (including partial), and integrod-
ifferential equations to a linear system of equations or matrix. The moment method involves discretizing,
sampling,  and  approximating  the  deﬁning  equations  using  basis  or  expansion functions  to  replace  the
unknown  and  testing  or  weighting  functions  to  satisfy  the  deﬁning  equations.  The  matrix  that  results
may be full (all coefﬁcients nonzero) or sparse (only a few per row are nonzero), depending on whether
the model is an integral or differential equation.
