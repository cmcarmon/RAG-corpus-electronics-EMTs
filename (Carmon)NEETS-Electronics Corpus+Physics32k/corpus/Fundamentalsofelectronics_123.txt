positive current ﬂow is in the same direction as positive voltage drop. Once you deﬁne voltages and currents,
we need six non-redundant equations to solve for the six unknown voltages and currents. By specifying the
source, we have one; this amounts to providing the source’s v-i relation. The v-i relations for the resistors
give us two more. We are only halfway there; where do we get the other three equations we need?
