Another major factor in the attenuation of surface waves is frequency. Recall from earlier 
discussions on wavelength that the higher the frequency of a radio wave, the shorter its wavelength will 
be. These high frequencies, with their shorter wavelengths, are not normally diffracted but are absorbed 
by the Earth at points relatively close to the transmitting site. You can assume, therefore, that as the 
frequency of a surface wave is increased, the more rapidly the surface wave will be absorbed, or 
attenuated, by the Earth. Because of this loss by attenuation, the surface wave is impractical for long-
distance transmissions at frequencies above 2 megahertz. On the other hand, when the frequency of a 
surface wave is low enough to have a very long wavelength, the Earth appears to be very small, and 
diffraction is sufficient for propagation well beyond the horizon. In fact, by lowering the transmitting 
frequency into the very low frequency (vlf) range and using very high-powered transmitters, the surface 
wave can be propagated great distances. The Navy's extremely high-powered vlf transmitters are actually 
capable of transmitting surface wave signals around the Earth and can provide coverage to naval units 
operating anywhere at sea.
