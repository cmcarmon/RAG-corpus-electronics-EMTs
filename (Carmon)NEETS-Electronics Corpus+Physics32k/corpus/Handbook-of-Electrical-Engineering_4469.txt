where 
 has been assumed piecewise constant. This choice of gauge decouples the vector potential from the
scalar potential. For the important class of two-dimensional problems there will be only one component of A
parallel to the excitation current density. For ﬁelds involving time, at least two types can be distinguished: the
time harmonic (ac) case in which the ﬁelds are periodic at a given frequency 
t), and the
transient case in which the time dependence is arbitrary.
