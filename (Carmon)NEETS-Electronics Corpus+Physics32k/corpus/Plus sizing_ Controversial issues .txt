Some people claim larger wheels wear faster. Wheels with reduced sidewall heights may increase risk of damaged rims, breaking the bead, and/or damaged sidewalls. The increased width of the contact patch of wider tires may increase the risk of hydroplaning.
Plus sizing tires may enhance the vehicle's value. Improving the vehicle from the factory specifications may increase value.
The additional height and weight of plus sized wheels may reduce vulnerability to rollovers, particularly by changing the center of gravity. During rapid tire deflation at speed, reduced sidewall height may decrease rollovers.
Total wheel weight (tire & rim) is part of the unsprung weight of the vehicle and will have a great effect on traction while traveling over uneven terrain as the wheel can respond quicker (lighter weight) to terrain changes. This allows the wheel to get back on the ground more quickly.
