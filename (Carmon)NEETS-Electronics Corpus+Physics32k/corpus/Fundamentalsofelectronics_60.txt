Using the complex plane, we can envision the complex exponential’s temporal variations as seen in the
above ﬁgure (Figure 2.2). The magnitude of the complex exponential is A, and the initial value of the
complex exponential at t = 0 has an angle of φ. As time increases, the locus of points traced by the complex
exponential is a circle (it has constant magnitude of A). The number of times per second we go around the
circle equals the frequency f. The time taken for the complex exponential to go around the circle once is
known as its period T , and equals 1
f . The projections onto the real and imaginary axes of the rotating
vector representing the complex exponential signal are the cosine and sine signal of Euler’s relation (2.16).
