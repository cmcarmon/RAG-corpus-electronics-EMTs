In some cases a power supply may not use a transformer; therefore, the power supply would be 
connected directly to the source line voltage. This type of connection is used primarily because it is 
economical. However, unless the power supply is completely insulated, it presents a dangerous shock 
hazard to anyone who comes in contact with it. When a transformer is not being used, the return side of 
the ac line is connected to the metal chassis. To remove this potential shock hazard and to have the option 
of stepping up or stepping down the input voltage to the rectifier, a transformer must be used.
