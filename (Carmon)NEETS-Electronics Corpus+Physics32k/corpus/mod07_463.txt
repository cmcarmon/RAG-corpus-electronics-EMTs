Now let's discuss the dc component of the applied voltage. Remember, a capacitor offers an infinite 
(âˆž) impedance to the flow of direct current. The dc component, therefore, must flow through RL and L1. 
As far as the dc is concerned, the capacitor does not exist. The coil and the load are therefore in series 
with each other. The dc resistance of a filter choke is very low (50 ohms average). Consequently, most of 
the dc component is developed across the load and a very small amount of the dc voltage is dropped 
across the coil, as shown in figure 4-26.
