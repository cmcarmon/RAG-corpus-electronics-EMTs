. Synchronized DRAM (SDRAM) is a generic name for
any DRAM that is synchronized with the clock speed
optimized for the CPU. SDRAM is faster than EDO
DRAM because SDRAM chips can synchronize their op-
erations with the processor clock. Moreover, SDRAM also
allows new memory access before the preceeding access is
completed. The speed of SDRAM is rated in megahertz
instead of the traditional nanoseconds because a com-
parison can easily be made to the system bus speed. A
typical speed of the SDRAM is 66 to 125 MHz.
