The per-phase synchronous reactance of a three-phase, wye-connected, 2.5-MVA, 6.6-kV, 60-Hz
turboalternator is 10 . Neglect the armature resistance and saturation. Calculate the voltage
regulation when the generator is operating at full load with (a) 0.8 power factor lagging, and (b)
0.8 power factor leading.
