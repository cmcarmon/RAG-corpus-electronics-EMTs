What is the transmission bandwidth of these signal sets? We need only consider the baseband version
as the second is an amplitude-modulated version of the ﬁrst. The bandwidth is determined by the bit
sequence. If the bit sequence is constant—always 0 or always 1—the transmitted signal is a constant, which
has zero bandwidth. The worst-case—bandwidth consuming—bit sequence is the alternating one shown in
Figure 6.10. In this case, the transmitted signal is a square wave having a period of 2T .
