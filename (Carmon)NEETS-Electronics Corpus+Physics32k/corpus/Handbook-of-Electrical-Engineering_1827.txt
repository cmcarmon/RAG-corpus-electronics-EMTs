If the 4-D Fourier transform of the unit impulse response h(x,t) of a 4-D linear shift-invariant (LSI) ﬁlter is
denoted by H(k,w), then the response y(x,t) of the ﬁlter to s(x,t) is the 4-D linear convolution of h(x,t) and
s(x,t), which is, uniquely, characterized by its 4-D Fourier transform
Y(k,w) = H(k,w)S(k,w)
