This ED algorithm generally applies to only thermal generation units that have cost characteristics of the
type discussed here. The hydro units have to be dispatched with different considerations. Although there is no
cost for the water, the amount of water available is limited over a period, and the displacement of fossil fuel
by  this  water  determines  its  worth.  Thus,  if  the  water  usage  limitation  over  a  period  is  known,  say  from  a
previously computed hydro optimization, the water worth can be used to dispatch the hydro units.
