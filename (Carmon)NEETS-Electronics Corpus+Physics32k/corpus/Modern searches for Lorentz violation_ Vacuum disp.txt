Another effect often discussed in connection with Quantum gravity (QG) is the possibility of Dispersion of light in vacuum (i.e. the dependence of light speed on photon energy), due to Lorentz violating Dispersion relations. This effect should be strong at energy levels comparable to, or beyond the Planck energy

GeV, while being extraordinarily weak at energies accessible in the laboratory or observed in astrophysical objects. In an attempt to observe a weak dependence of speed on energy, light from distant astrophysical sources such as gamma ray bursts and distant galaxies has been examined in many experiments. Especially the Fermi-LAT group was able show that no energy dependence and thus no observable Lorentz violation occurs in the photon sector even beyond the Planck energy, which excludes a large class of Lorentz-violating quantum gravity models.
