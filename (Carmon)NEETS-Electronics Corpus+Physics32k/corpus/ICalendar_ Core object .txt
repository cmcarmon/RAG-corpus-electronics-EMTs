The top-level element in iCalendar is the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object, a collection of calendar and scheduling information. Typically, this information will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple iCalendar objects can be grouped together.
The first line must be BEGIN:VCALENDAR, and the last line must be END:VCALENDAR; the contents between these lines is called the "icalbody".
The second line VERSION:2.0 indicates that the data is in iCalendar format. VERSION:1.0 was used to specify that data is in the old vCalendar format.
The body of the iCalendar object (the icalbody) is made up of a list of calendar properties and one or more calendar components. The calendar properties apply to the entire calendar. The calendar components are several calendar properties which create a calendar schematic (design). For example, the calendar component can specify an event, a to-do list, a journal entry, time zone information, or free/busy time information, or an alarm. Empty lines are not allowed in some versions of usage (Google calendar).
Here is a simple example of an iCalendar object, "Bastille Day Party" event which occurs July 14, 1997 17:00 (UTC) through July 15, 1997 03:59:59 (UTC):
