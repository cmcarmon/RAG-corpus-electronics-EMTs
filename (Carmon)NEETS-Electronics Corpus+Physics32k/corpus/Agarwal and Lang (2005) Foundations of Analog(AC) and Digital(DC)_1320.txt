This response can also be obtained directly by substituting Equation 9.80
into Equation 9.64, and then making use of Equation 9.82. At first glance, it
might not appear that CV◦δ(t) has the units of current, but it does because CV◦
has the units of charge, and δ(t) has the units of reciprocal time. In fact, CV◦ is
the total charge delivered by the impulse current.
