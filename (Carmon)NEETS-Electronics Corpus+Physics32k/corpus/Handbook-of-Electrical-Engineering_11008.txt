ECG Leads
The  spread  of  excitation  and  recovery  over  the  atria  and  ventricles  varies  in  direction  with  time.  Therefore,
excitation and recovery are vectors, and the location of body-surface electrodes is important. For this reason,
standard electrode sites have been adopted, as shown in Fig. 113.16. There are three standard limb leads, three
augmented (a) limb leads, and six chest (V) leads, the latter being monopolar. The reference for the monopolar
chest leads is the centerpoint of three resistors (r), each joined to one of the limb electrodes. The right leg is
used to ground the subject. Each lead “sees” a different region of the heart. The use of so many leads allows
quick and easy identiﬁcation of the direction of propagation of excitation (and recovery) by merely inspecting
the amplitudes of the waveforms in the various leads. If excitation (or recovery) travels orthogonal to a lead
axis, the net amplitude will be zero or very small. If excitation (or recovery) travels parallel to a lead axis, the
amplitude of the wave will be maximum. Figure 113.16 illustrates the amplitudes of the P, QRS, and T waves
for the 12 ECG leads. Note that leads 1, 2, 3, aVR, aVL, and aVF identify the vector projections in the frontal
plane. Leads V1–6 identify the vector components in a quasi-horizontal plane. There are normal values for the
amplitudes and durations for the P, QRS, and T waves as well as their vectors. The interested reader can ﬁnd
more on ECG in the many handbooks on this subject. Two good, recently published texts are by Chou [1991]
and Phillips and Feeney [1990].
