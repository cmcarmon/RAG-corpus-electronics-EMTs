Trackball: The earliest version of an input device using a roller ball, differing from the mouse in that the ball
is contained in a unit that can remain in a ﬁxed position while the ball is rotated. It is sometimes referred
to as an upside-down mouse, but the reverse is more appropriate as the trackball came ﬁrst.
