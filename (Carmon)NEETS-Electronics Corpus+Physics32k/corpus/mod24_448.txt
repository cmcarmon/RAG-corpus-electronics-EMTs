BUTT-JOINTED and EXPANDED BEAM CONNECTORS are two ways to classify fiber optic
connectors. Butt-jointed connectors bring the prepared ends of two fibers into close contact. Expanded
beam connectors use two lenses to first expand and then refocus the light from the transmitting fiber into
the receiving fiber.
