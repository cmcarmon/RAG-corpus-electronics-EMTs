The first mechanical adding machine (calculator) was invented by Blaise Pascal (French) in 1642. 
Twenty years later, an Englishman, Sir Samuel Morland, developed a more compact device that could 
multiply, add, and subtract. In 1682, Wilhelm Liebnitz (German) perfected a machine that could perform 
all the basic operations (addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication), as well as extract the square 
root. Liebnitz's principles are still in use today in our modern electronic digital computers.
