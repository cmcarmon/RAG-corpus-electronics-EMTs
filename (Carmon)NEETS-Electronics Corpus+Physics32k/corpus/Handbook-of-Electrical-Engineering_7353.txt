Meanwhile, industrial telemetry has developed along different lines, producing miniaturized complete cap-
sules for applications to process control, detection of defects, and machine design. Medical science is currently
using telemetry in experimental, clinical, and diagnostic applications. Some of the particular body characteristics
telemetered include heartbeat, brain waves, blood pressure, temperature, voice patterns, heart sounds, respira-
tion sounds, and muscle tensions. Similar studies are being pursued in the biological and psychological Ô¨Åelds,
where more experimental latitude permits embedding of transmitters within living animals.
