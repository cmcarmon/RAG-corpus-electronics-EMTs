Two sound waves moving simultaneously through the same medium will advance independently,
each producing a disturbance as if the other were not present. If the two waves have the same
frequency—in phase with each other—and are moving in the same direction, they are additive and are
said to interfere constructively. If the two waves have the same frequency and are moving in the same
direction, but out of phase with each other, they are subtractive and are said to interfere destructively. If
these two subtractive waves have equal amplitudes, the waves cancel each other. This addition or
subtraction of waves is often called interference.
