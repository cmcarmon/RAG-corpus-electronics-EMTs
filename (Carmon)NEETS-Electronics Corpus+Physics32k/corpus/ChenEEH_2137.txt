Example 1.1
One end of a copper wire (diameter ¼ 2 mm) is attached to
one end of an aluminum wire (diameter ¼ 4 mm). A direct
current I ¼ 10 mA is passing through the wires. To determine
the current density in each wire, equation 1.3 is applied
assuming the current density is uniformly distributed over
the cross-section:
