Russia and most republics in the Soviet Union abolished the decree time (not moving the clocks) on 31 March 1991, but Russia reversed this the following year (except Samara Oblast which was already in UTC+04:00).

On 29 September 1991, 03:00:00, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from MSK to MSK+1 (thus reinstating Samara Time; MSK+1). So the zone boundaries on 20 October, Samara Oblast changed its time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+4.

On 23 May 1993, 00:00:00, Novosibirsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.
The change occurred during DST effectively changing the offset from UTC+8 to UTC+7, the offset without DST was therefore changed from UTC+7 to UTC+6.

On 28 May 1995, 00:00:00, Altai Krai and Altai Republic changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.

On 30 March 1997, 02:00:00, Sakhalin Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+8 to MSK+7.

On 1 May 2002, 03:00:00, Tomsk Oblast changed its time zone from MSK+4 to MSK+3.

On 1 January 2004, 00:00:00, New Siberian Islands, Tomponsky District and Ust-Maysky District changed its time zone from MSK+6 to MSK+7.

The following time zone changes occurred on 28 March 2010, which, in particular, led to abolition of two of the eleven time zones.
Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Kamchatka Krai started using Magadan Time, thus eliminating Kamchatka Time (MSK+9 or UTC+12 without DST).
Kemerovo Oblast started using Omsk Time.
The Udmurt Republic and Samara Oblast started using Moscow Time, thus eliminating Samara Time (MSK+1 or UTC+4 without DST).
Although the Russian government wants to reduce the number of time zones even further, there have been protests in far-eastern Russia on the recent changes, including protests and a 20,000-strong petition in support of Kamchatka returning to UTC+12.

The decree No. 725 (31 August 2011) changed UTC offset for Moscow Time and the other time zones. Moscow Time Zone now used UTC+04:00 all year around. The notions of decree time and daylight saving time were abolished in the law, but in fact, this law mandated permanent daylight saving time (or even double daylight saving time in regions that had not abolished the decree time). Some areas changed offset from Moscow:
Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Magadan Time (Zone 9) to Vladivostok Time (from Zone 8):
Oymyakonsky District
Some districts of the Sakha Republic switched from Vladivostok Time (Zone 8) to Yakutsk Time (Zone 7):
New Siberian Islands
Tomponsky District
Ust-Maysky District

Blue Yakutsk Time (MSK+6), pink Vladivostok Time (MSK+7), red Magadan Time (MSK+8).

As a result of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, local authorities in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol decreed that clocks in the newly proclaimed Russian federal subjects should jump ahead two hours at 10 p.m. on 29 March 2014 to switch from Eastern European Time (UTC+2) to Moscow Time (UTC+4).
On 22 July 2014, further changes were passed, which took effect on 26 October 2014. All of Russia moved back one hour, so Moscow Time became UTC+3. Some areas changed offset from Moscow:
Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and Kamchatka Krai remained on UTC+12:00 (thus reinstating Kamchatka Time, MSK+9)
Magadan Oblast moved back two hours to UTC+10:00 (went from Magadan Time, MSK+8 to Vladivostok Time, MSK+7)
The parts of the Magadan Time zone that remained on MSK+8, were given a new time zone name, Srednekolymsk Time, UTC+11.
Zabaykalsky Krai moved back two hours to UTC+08:00 (went from Yakutsk to Irkutsk Time)
Kemerovo Oblast remained on UTC+07:00 (went from Omsk to Krasnoyarsk Time)
Udmurtia and Samara Oblast remained on UTC+04:00 (thus reinstating Samara Time, MSK+1)
Annual DST changes is not observed.

Sakhalin Oblast moved forward one hour from UTC+10:00 to UTC+11:00 (from Vladivostok to Srednekolymsk time), except Severo-Kurilsky District, which was already in UTC+11:00 (Srednekolymsk Time)
