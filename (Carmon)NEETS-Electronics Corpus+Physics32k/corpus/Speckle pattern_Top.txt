A speckle pattern is an intensity pattern produced by the mutual interference of a set of wavefronts. This phenomenon has been investigated by scientists since the time of Newton, but speckles have come into prominence since the invention of the laser and have now found a variety of applications. The term speckle pattern is also commonly used in the experimental mechanics community to describe the pattern of physical speckles on a surface  which is useful for measuring displacement fields via digital image correlation.
Speckle patterns typically occur in diffuse reflections of monochromatic light such as laser light. Such reflections may occur on materials such as paper, white paint, rough surfaces, or in media with a large number of scattering particles in space, such as airborne dust or in cloudy liquids.
