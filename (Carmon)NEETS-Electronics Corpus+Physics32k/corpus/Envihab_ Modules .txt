The 5 modules of Envihab are all linked with each other via the medical core area. They are lockable individually as well as in combination of different modules to control parameters like acoustics, climate (temperature, humidity, light), oxygen content and pressure. Test persons can be isolated, immobilized and purposely exposed to stress. In addition, psychological and physiological methods for rehabilitation and as countermeasures i.e. against the effects of immobilization/zero gravity will be analyzed. Envihab is designed to hold/house large training and simulation devices. Outstanding features will be the human centrifuge in the center of :envihab as well as areas where the amount of oxygen can be reduced and an area where pressure can be used to simulate altitudes of up to 5,500 meters.
