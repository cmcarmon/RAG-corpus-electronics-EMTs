(cid:1) This chapter expanded on our treatment of small-signal models, focusing
on the model for three-terminal devices and amplifiers. As first introduced
in Section 4.5, small-signal analysis applies when devices and circuits that
are possibly nonlinear are operated over a very narrow range. Small-signal
analysis finds a piecewise linear model that ensures maximum accuracy of
fit over that narrow operating range. The principal benefit of small-signal
models is that the small-signal variables display linear v i relations over the
narrow operating range, thereby enabling the use of all of our linear analysis
techniques such as superposition, Th√©venin, and Norton.
