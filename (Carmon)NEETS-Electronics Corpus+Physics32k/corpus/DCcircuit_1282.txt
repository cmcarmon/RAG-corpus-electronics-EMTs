Ctotal =  C1 C2
As you will no doubt notice, this is exactly opposite of the phenomenon exhibited by re-
sistors. With resistors, series connections result in additive values while parallel connections
result in diminished values. With capacitors, its the reverse: parallel connections result in
additive values while series connections result in diminished values.
