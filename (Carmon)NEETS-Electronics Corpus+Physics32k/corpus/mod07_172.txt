Another way of checking a diode is with the substitution method. In this method, a good diode is
substituted for a questionable diode. This technique should be used only after you have made voltage and
resistance measurements to make certain that there is no circuit defect that might damage the substitution
diode. If more than one defective diode is present in the equipment section where trouble has been
localized, this method becomes cumbersome, since several diodes may have to be replaced before the
trouble is corrected. To determine which stages failed and which diodes are not defective, all of the
removed diodes must be tested. This can be accomplished by observing whether the equipment operates
correctly as each of the removed diodes is reinserted into the equipment.
