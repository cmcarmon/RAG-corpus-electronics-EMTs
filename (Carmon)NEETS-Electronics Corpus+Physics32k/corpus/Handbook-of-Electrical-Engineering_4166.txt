To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  horizontal  or  vertical  electric  ﬁelds  very  close  to  natural  lightning,  at
distances from tens to hundreds of meters, necessary to the understanding of the voltages induced by very close
lightning, have been published, although such close ﬁelds have been calculated by Diendorfer [1990] and by
Rubinstein  et al.  [1990]  using  different  return  stroke  models.  These  two  sets  of  calculated  ﬁelds  are  to  be
considered  model-dependent  estimates.  Although  there  is  disagreement  between  the  two  studies  as  to  the
waveshape of ﬁelds and in how appreciable is the inﬂuence of a ﬁnite ground conductivity at small distances,
both studies yield horizontal ﬁeld amplitudes at the height of a typical power distribution line comparable to
the amplitude of the vertical ﬁeld. Note that no return stroke model used to date (see next section) takes proper
account of the attachment process referred to earlier and hence probably none accurately models the ﬁelds at
very early times. Further, the leader ﬁelds preceding the return stroke ﬁeld change are not taken into account
in the existing models, although such ﬁelds at very close range are clearly important since it is the leader charge
near ground that the return stroke discharges to ground, and hence the leader and return stroke electrostatic
ﬁeld changes should be of equivalent magnitude very close to the ground strike point (Rubinstein et al., 1995).
