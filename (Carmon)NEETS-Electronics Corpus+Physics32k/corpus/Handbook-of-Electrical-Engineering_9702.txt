The  deÔ¨Ånitions  given  for  MTTF  and  MTBF  are  the  most  commonly  accepted  ones.  In  some  texts,  MTBF  is
wrongly used as mean time before failure, confusing it with MTTF. In many real systems, MTTF is very much
greater than MTTR, so the values of MTTF and MTBF will be almost identical, in any case.
