In  practice,  we  use  a  slightly  more  complex 
equivalent  circuit  model  in  the  analysis  of  a 
transistor  amplifier.  The  most  frequently  used 
equivalent circuit is that which is based on hybrid 
parameters  (or  h-parameters).  In  this  form  of 
analysis,  a 
four 
components;  hi, hr, hf and  ho (see  Table  7.4).  In 
order to indicate which one of the operating modes 
is  used  we  add  a  further  subscript  letter  to  each  
h-parameter; e for common emitter, b for common 
base  and  c  for  common  collector  (see  Table  7.5). 
However,  to  keep  things  simple,  we  will  only 
consider common-emitter operation here.
