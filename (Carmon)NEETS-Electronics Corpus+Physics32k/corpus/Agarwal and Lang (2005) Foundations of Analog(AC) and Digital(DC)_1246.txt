as the electric energy stored in a capacitor. The units of energy is the Joule [ J], or
Watt-second. Unlike a resistor, a capacitor stores energy rather than dissipates it.
Capacitors come in an enormous range of values. For example, two pieces
of insulated wire about an inch long, when twisted together, will have a capaci-

an inch in diameter and a few inches long could have a capacitance of 100,000
microfarads (0.1 farad; 1 microfarad, abbreviated as µF, is 10
