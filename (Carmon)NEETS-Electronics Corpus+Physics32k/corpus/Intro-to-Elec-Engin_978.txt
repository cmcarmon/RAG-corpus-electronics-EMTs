The generation of motional emf is further illustrated by a simple example, as shown
in Figure 12.1.3(b), where a single-turn coil formed by the moving (or sliding) conductor
(moving with velocity U), the two conducting rails, and the voltmeter are situated in a
magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux density B. The conductor moving with a velocity U, in a direction at
right angles to both B and l, sweeps the area lU in 1 second. The ﬂux per unit time in this
area is BlU, which is also the ﬂux linkage per unit time with the single-turn coil. Thus,
the induced emf e is simply given by BlU. The motional emf (or speed emf) is always
associated with the conversion of energy between the mechanical and electrical forms.
