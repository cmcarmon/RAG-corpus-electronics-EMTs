In the direct-melt process, multicomponent glass rods form the fiber structure. Rods of
multicomponent glass combine in a molten state to form the fiber core and cladding. The double-crucible
method is the most common direct-melt process. The double-crucible method combines the molten rods
into a single preform using two concentric crucibles. Optical fibers are drawn from this molten glass
using a similar fiber drawing process as in vapor phase oxidation. Figure 3-12 illustrates the double-
crucible drawing process.
