As the circuit current increases from 20 milliamps to 60 milliamps, the voltage drops across
R1 and R3 (which havenâ€™t changed resistances) increase as well, so that the two resistors are
dropping the whole 9 volts. R2, being bypassed by the very low resistance of the jumper wire,
is effectively eliminated from the circuit, the resistance from one lead to the other having been
reduced to zero. Thus, the voltage drop across R2, even with the increased total current, is zero
volts.
