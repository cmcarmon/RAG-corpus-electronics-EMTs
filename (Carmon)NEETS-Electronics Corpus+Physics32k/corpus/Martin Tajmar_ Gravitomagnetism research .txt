In a 2003 paper, Tajmar proposed that a gravitational effect may explain the long-standing discrepancy between the mass of Cooper pairs first measured in superconductors by Janet Tate et al. and the theoretically-expected value.
In 2006 Tajmar and several coworkers announced their claim to have measured a gravitomagnetic version of the frame-dragging effect caused by a superconductor with an accelerating or decelerating spin. As of April 2008, the effect has not yet been observed independently.
In February 2008 Tajmar filed an international patent application for a "Process for the generation of a gravitational field and a gravitational field generator."
In June 2008, Tajmar reported a new phenomenon suggesting that signals could be induced in a gyroscope resulting from a new property of rotating low-temperature helium. He also reported that because the rings in the experiment were accelerated pneumatically, and not with high acceleration, the earlier reported results could not be discounted. His further research suggests the anomaly may indeed be coming from liquid helium in the setup.
