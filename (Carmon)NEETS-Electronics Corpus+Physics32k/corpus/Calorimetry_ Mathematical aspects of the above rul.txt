The use of 'very small' quantities such as



δ
Q



{\displaystyle \delta Q\ }
is related to the physical requirement for the quantity



p
(
V
,
T
)



{\displaystyle p(V,T)\ }
to be 'rapidly determined' by



V



{\displaystyle V\ }
and



T



{\displaystyle T\ }
; such 'rapid determination' refers to a physical process. These 'very small' quantities are used in the Leibniz approach to the infinitesimal calculus. The Newton approach uses instead 'fluxions' such as






V
˙



(
t
)
=






d
V


d
t



|


t




{\displaystyle {\dot {V}}(t)=\left.{\frac {dV}{dt}}\right|_{t}}
, which makes it more obvious that



p
(
V
,
T
)



{\displaystyle p(V,T)\ }
must be 'rapidly determined'.
In terms of fluxions, the above first rule of calculation can be written







Q
˙



(
t
)

=

C

T


(
V
)


(
V
,
T
)




V
˙



(

(

T
˙



(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}(t)\ =C_{T}^{(V)}(V,T)\,{\dot {V}}(t)\,+\,C_{V}^{(T)}(V,T)\,{\dot {T}}(t)}

where




t



{\displaystyle t\ }
denotes the time







Q
˙



(
t
)



{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}(t)\ }
denotes the time rate of heating of the calorimetric material at time



t



{\displaystyle t\ }








V
˙



(
t
)



{\displaystyle {\dot {V}}(t)\ }
denotes the time rate of change of volume of the calorimetric material at time



t



{\displaystyle t\ }








T
˙



(
t
)



{\displaystyle {\dot {T}}(t)\ }
denotes the time rate of change of temperature of the calorimetric material.
The increment



δ
Q



{\displaystyle \delta Q\ }
and the fluxion






Q
˙



(
t
)



{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}(t)\ }
are obtained for a particular time



t



{\displaystyle t\ }
that determines the values of the quantities on the righthand sides of the above rules. But this is not a reason to expect that there should exist a mathematical function



Q
(
V
,
T
)



{\displaystyle Q(V,T)\ }
. For this reason, the increment



δ
Q



{\displaystyle \delta Q\ }
is said to be an 'imperfect differential' or an 'inexact differential'. Some books indicate this by writing



q



{\displaystyle q\ }
instead of



δ
Q



{\displaystyle \delta Q\ }
. Also, the notation đQ is used in some books. Carelessness about this can lead to error.
The quantity



Δ
Q
(
P
(

t

1


,

t

2


)
)



{\displaystyle \Delta Q(P(t_{1},t_{2}))\ }
is properly said to be a functional of the continuous joint progression



P
(

t

1


,

t

2


)



{\displaystyle P(t_{1},t_{2})\ }
of



V
(
t
)



{\displaystyle V(t)\ }
and



T
(
t
)



{\displaystyle T(t)\ }
, but, in the mathematical definition of a function,



Δ
Q
(
P
(

t

1


,

t

2


)
)



{\displaystyle \Delta Q(P(t_{1},t_{2}))\ }
is not a function of



(
V
,
T
)



{\displaystyle (V,T)\ }
. Although the fluxion






Q
˙



(
t
)



{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}(t)\ }
is defined here as a function of time



t



{\displaystyle t\ }
, the symbols



Q



{\displaystyle Q\ }
and



Q
(
V
,
T
)



{\displaystyle Q(V,T)\ }
respectively standing alone are not defined here.
