By combining just NAND gates or just NOR gates in just the right way, you 
can create any of the other logical functions. Thatâ€™s why NAND and NOR 
gates are sometimes called universal gates. Chip makers typically build digi-
tal circuits using just NAND gates so that they can focus their research and 
development efforts on improving the process and design of just one basic 
logic gate.
