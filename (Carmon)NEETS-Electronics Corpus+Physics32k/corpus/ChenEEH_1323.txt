. A mouse is a small handheld device used to control the
position of the cursor on the video display. This is the
second most important input device other than a key-
board. The movements of a mouse on a desktop corres-
pond to the movements of the cursor on the screen. The
most common technology used nowadays is a mechanical
mouse due to its reliability and production cost. Other
technologies are optical and optomechanical. A mechan-
ical mouse uses a rubber ball to track movements. An
optical mouse, on the other hand, uses LED and photo
detector to detect changes in gridlines an on the mouse
pads an optomechanical mouse combines rubber balls
with optical detection that detects rubber ball movements
instead of mouse movements. Different manufacturers
come up with different designs for a mouse, such as
IntelliMouse by Microsoft and NoHands (foot mouse)
by Hunter Digital.
