The polarity of the terminals in an ohmmeter  appears 
at the leads of the ohmmeter: Red is positive and black 
is negative or common. If the positive ohmmeter lead 
is connected to the anode of the diode and the negative 
lead to the cathode, the diode is forward biased. Cur-
rent should then flow through the diode, and the meter 
should indicate a low resistance. If the meter leads are re-
versed, the diode is reverse b iased. Little current should 
flow, and the meter should measure a high resistance.
