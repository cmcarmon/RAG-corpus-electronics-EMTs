Reliability and economics are very closely related. Issues such as the level of reliability required, the amount of
additional expenditures justiÔ¨Åed, where to invest the additional resources to maximize reliability, how to achieve
a  certain  level  of  overall  reliability  at  minimum  cost,  and  how  to  assess  the  cost  of  failures  and  monetary
equivalent of non-monetary items are all quite complex and not purely technical. However, once managerial
decisions are made and reliability goals are set, certain well-proven techniques such as incorporating redun-
dancy, improving maintenance procedures, selecting better quality components, etc. can be employed by the
designer to achieve the goals.
