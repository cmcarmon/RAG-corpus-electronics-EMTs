¯VS = ¯A ¯VR + ¯B ¯IR and ¯IS = ¯C ¯VR + ¯D ¯IR,
in which the generally complex parameters ¯A,
¯B,
¯C, and ¯D depend on the transmission-line
series impedance ¯Z of the transmission line, ﬁnd
the parameters ¯A, ¯B, ¯C, and ¯D and specify their
units. Also evaluate ( ¯A ¯D − ¯B ¯C).
the series impedance ¯Z, sketch phasor diagrams
