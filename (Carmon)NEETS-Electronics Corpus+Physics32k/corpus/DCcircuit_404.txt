The table found in the Bussmann handbook differs slightly from the one available from
MIT: for the DC threshold of perception (men), the MIT table gives 5.2 mA while the Bussmann
table gives a slightly greater ﬁgure of 6.2 mA. Also, for the ”unable to let go” 60 Hz AC threshold
(men), the MIT table gives 20 mA while the Bussmann table gives a lesser ﬁgure of 16 mA. As I
have yet to obtain a primary copy of Dalziel’s research, the ﬁgures cited here are conservative:
I have listed the lowest values in my table where any data sources differ.
