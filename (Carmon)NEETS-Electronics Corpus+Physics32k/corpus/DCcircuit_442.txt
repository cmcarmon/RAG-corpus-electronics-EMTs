Again, we have three resistors, but this time they form more than one continuous path for
electrons to ﬂow. There’s one path from 8 to 7 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. There’s another
from 8 to 7 to 6 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. And then there’s a third path from 8 to 7 to
6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 8 again. Each individual path (through R1, R2, and R3) is
called a branch.
