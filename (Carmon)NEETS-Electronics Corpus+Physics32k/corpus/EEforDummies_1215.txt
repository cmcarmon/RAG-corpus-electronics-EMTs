If you’re building a circuit that’s new to you, it’s good electronics practice 
to build it on a solderless breadboard first. That’s because you often need 
to tweak a circuit to get it working right. When you have it working to your 
 satisfaction, you can make the circuit permanent if you like. Just take your 
time — and remember to double‐ (and even triple‐) check your work. Don’t 
worry — you’ll be an old hand in no time.
