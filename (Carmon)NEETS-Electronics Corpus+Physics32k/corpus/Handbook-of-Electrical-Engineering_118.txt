The Q of the coil can be measured using the circuit of Fig. 1.20 for
frequencies  up  to  1  MHz.  The  voltage  across  the  inductance  (L)  at
resonance equals Q(V) (where V is the voltage developed by the oscil-
lator); therefore, it is only necessary to measure the output voltage from
the oscillator and the voltage across the inductance.
