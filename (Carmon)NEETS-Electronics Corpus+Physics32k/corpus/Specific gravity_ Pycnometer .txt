Specific gravity can be measured in a number of value ways. The following illustration involving the use of the pycnometer is instructive. A pycnometer is simply a bottle which can be precisely filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume,



V


{\displaystyle V}
. Placed upon a balance of some sort it will exert a force .

{\displaystyle F_{b}=g(m_{b}-\rho _{a}{m_{b} \over \rho _{b}})}

where




m

b




{\displaystyle m_{b}}
is the mass of the bottle and



g


{\displaystyle g}
the gravitational acceleration at the location at which the measurements are being made.




ρ

a




{\displaystyle \rho _{a}}
is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and




ρ

b




{\displaystyle \rho _{b}}
is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by Archimedes Principle must be subtracted. The bottle is filled with air, but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:

.


{\displaystyle F_{w}=g(m_{b}-\rho _{a}{m_{b} \over \rho _{b}}+V\rho _{w}-V\rho _{a}).}

If we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.

{\displaystyle F_{w,n}=gV(\rho _{w}-\rho _{a})}

where the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:

where

{\displaystyle SG_{A}={gV(\rho _{s}-\rho _{a}) \over gV(\rho _{w}-\rho _{a})}={(\rho _{s}-\rho _{a}) \over (\rho _{w}-\rho _{a})}.}

This is called the Apparent Specific Gravity, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a hydrometer (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does

In the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true specific gravity. This is found from

Since the density of dry air at 1013.25 mb at 20 °C is 0.001205 g·cm−3 and that of water is 0.998203 g·cm−3 the difference between true and apparent specific gravities for a substance with specific gravity (20°C/20°C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the specific gravity of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.
