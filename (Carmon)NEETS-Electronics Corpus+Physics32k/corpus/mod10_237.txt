A sine wave can be one cycle or many cycles. Recall from chapter 1 that the number of cycles of a 
sine wave that are completed in 1 second is known as the frequency of the sine wave. For example, 60 
cycles of ordinary house current occur each second, so house current is said to have a frequency of 60 
cycles per second or 60 hertz.
