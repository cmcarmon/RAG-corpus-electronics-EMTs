In a summing amplifier, the resistor chosen for the 
noninverting input-to-ground is equal to the total par-
allel resistance of the input and feedback resistances. 
If the feedback resistance is increased, the circuit can 
provide gain. If different input resistances are used, 
the input signals can be added together with different 
gains.
