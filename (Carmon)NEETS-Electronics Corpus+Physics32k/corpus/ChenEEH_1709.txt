Further research has also been devoted to the indexing and
retrieval of object trajectories. One such system that makes use
of
features extracted from objects in the video
sequence with particular emphasis on object motion is VideoQ
(Chang et al., 1998). Once the object trajectory has been
extracted, modeling of this motion trail is essential for index-
ing and retrieval applications. A trajectory in this sense is a set
of 2-tuples {(xk, yk): k ¼ 1, . . ., N }, where (xk, yk) is the
location of the object’s centroid in the kth frame, and the object
has been tracked for a total of N frames. The trajectory is treated
as separable in its x and y-coordinates, and the two are pro-
cessed separately as 1-D signals. VideoQ models object trajec-
tory based on physical features like acceleration, velocity, and
arc length. In this approach, the trajectory is ﬁrst segmented
into smaller units called subtrajectories. The motivation of this
is two-fold. First, modeling of full object trajectories can be very
computationally intensive. Second, there might be many sce-
narios in which a part of the object trajectory is not available
due to occlusion. Moreover, the user might be interested in
certain partial movements of the objects. Physical feature-
based modeling is used to index each subtrajectory using accel-
eration and velocity, for example. These features are extracted
from the original subtrajectory by ﬁtting it with a second-order
polynomial as in the following equation:
r(t ) ¼ (x(t ), y(t )) ¼ 0:5at 2 þ v0t ,
