How a light ray is launched into a fiber is shown in figure 2-11. The incident ray I1 enters the fiber at
the angle � a. I1 is refracted upon entering the fiber and is transmitted to the core-cladding interface. The
ray then strikes the core-cladding interface at the critical angle (� c). I1 is totally reflected back into the
core and continues to propagate along the fiber. The incident ray I2 enters the fiber at an angle greater
than � a. Again, I2 is refracted upon entering the fiber and is transmitted to the core-cladding interface. I2
strikes the core-cladding interface at an angle less than the critical angle (� c). I2 is refracted into the
cladding and is eventually lost. The light ray incident on the fiber core must be within the acceptance
cone defined by the angle � a shown in figure 2-12. Angle � a is defined as the acceptance angle. The
acceptance angle (� a) is the maximum angle to the axis of the fiber that light entering the fiber is
