The PCVD Process.  The PCVD process (Fig. 42.21) also uses a starting tube, and the deposition takes place
inside the tube. Here, however, the tube is either stationary or oscillating and the pressure is kept at 10–15 torr.
Reactants are fed inside the tube, and the reaction is accomplished by a traveling microwave plasma inside the
tube. The entire tube is maintained at approximately 1200(cid:176)C. The plasma causes the heterogeneous depositions
of glass on the tube wall, and the deposition efﬁciency is very high. After the required depositions of the cladding
and core are complete, the tube is taken out and collapsed on a separate equipment. Extreme care is required
to prevent impurities from getting into the tube during the transport and collapse procedure. The PCVD process
has the advantages of high efﬁciency, no tube distortion because of the lower temperature, and very accurate
proﬁle control because of the large number of layers deposited in a short time. However, going to higher rates
of ﬂow presents some difﬁculties, because of a need to maintain the low pressure.
