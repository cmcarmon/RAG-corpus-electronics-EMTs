Power ﬂow Problem Formulation
In this subsection, we will construct the power ﬂow equations
in a structured manner using the admittance matrix Y bus
representation of the transmission network. The admittance
matrix Y bus is assumed to be known for the system under
consideration. Let us ﬁrst look at the complex power balance
at any bus, say bus i, in the network.
