where λ is the area under the voltage impulse. The impulse function allows the characterization
of networks in terms of the system’s natural response, which is dependent only on the network
elements and their interconnections. Once the impulse response is known, the system response
to nearly all excitation functions can be determined by techniques that are available, but not
disclosed here in view of the scope of this text.
