On 19 June 2016, the same New Shepard booster flew, now for a fourth time, again reaching over 330,000 feet, before returning successfully for a VTVL rocket-powered landing.
The capsule returned once again under parachutes but, this time, did a test descent with only two parachutes before finishing with a brief pulse of retro rocket propulsion to slow the ground impact velocity to 4.8 km/h (3 mph). The two parachutes "slowed the descent to 23 mph, as opposed to the usual 16 mph with three parachutes". Crushable bumpers are used to further reduce the landing shock through energy-absorbing deformation.
