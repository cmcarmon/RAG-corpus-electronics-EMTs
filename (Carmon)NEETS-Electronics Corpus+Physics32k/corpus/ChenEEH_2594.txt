Figure 7.36 illustrates examples of low-pass ﬁlters that can
be made out of strip line, microstrip line, and coaxial line
sections. The simplest example of a low-pass ﬁlter may be a
dc-biasing block ﬁlter used to isolate the RF from the dc
source, for example, in a microwave ampliﬁer circuit. The
operating bandwidth of a low-pass ﬁlter can range widely
depending on its lowest cutoff frequency point. Note that a
waveguide ﬁlter can also be designed as pseudo low-pass ﬁlter
in a waveguide band, but below the waveguide cutoff fre-
quency, no signal propagation will take place.
