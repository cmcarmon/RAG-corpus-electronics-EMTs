OPERATION AT RESONANCE.â€”When the input voltage ep is applied to the primary in figure
3-12 it also appears across L3 because, by inductive coupling, it is effectively connected in parallel with
the primary tank circuit. At the same time, a voltage is induced in the secondary winding and causes
current to flow around the secondary tank circuit. At resonance the tank acts like a resistive circuit; that is,
