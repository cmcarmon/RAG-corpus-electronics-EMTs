A comparison of the equations for the branch voltages and currents (Equa-
tions 3.10 through 3.16) with the corresponding Equations 2.147 through 2.152
in Chapter 2 shows that the node analysis has resulted in the same expressions
for the branch variables as did the direct analysis presented. However, the node
analysis obtained these results in a much simpler manner. The direct analysis
of Chapter 2 involved the solution of eight simultaneous equations, namely
Equations 2.139 through 2.146, while the node analysis involved the solution
of only one equation, namely Equation 3.5, and the explicit back substitution
of its solution.
