Note how all current ranges are power-of-ten multiples of the three scale ranges shown on
the meter face: 2.5, 5, and 10. In some range settings, such as the 2.5 mA for example, the
meter indication may be read directly on the 0 to 2.5 scale. For other range settings (250 µA,
50 mA, 100 mA, and 500 mA), the meter indication must be read off the appropriate scale
and then multiplied by either 10 or 100 to obtain the real ﬁgure. The highest current range
available on this meter is obtained with the rotary switch in the 2.5/10 amp position. The
distinction between 2.5 amps and 10 amps is made by the red test plug position: a special ”10
amp” jack next to the regular current-measuring jack provides an alternative plug setting to
select the higher range.
