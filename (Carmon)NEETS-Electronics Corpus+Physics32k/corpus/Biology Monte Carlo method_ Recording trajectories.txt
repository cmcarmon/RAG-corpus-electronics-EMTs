Other than counting the number of ions crossing the channel, sometimes it is desirable to study their behavior at different regions of the channel. Such examples would be the average occupancy of ions or their average moving velocity inside the channel or a nanopore. BioMOCA has been equipped with the option of dumping every ions position, average and instantaneous velocities, potential and kinetic energies, average and instantaneous displacements and other info at every step (or few steps) of the simulations in ASCII format, so such trajectory information could be studied later on to gather further statistics. From a technical point of view however, dumping such information for tens of ions, even at every few hundreds of time steps, could slow down the simulations and end up with huge files accumulating to tens of gigabytes. Loading such files later on from disk storage is also a very time consuming and computationally inefficient procedure. Over and above that, recoding the numerical information in ASCII format does not hold its machine precision and has loss of accuracy.
Solving such problems is actually an easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead. Not only it preserves the machine accuracy but also writing and reading to file system is a lot faster. The computational overhead to dump the trajectories becomes negligible and the trajectory files become about two orders of magnitude smaller in size. The downside might be that programming and decoding the data could become very tricky, but once itâ€™s done correctly and with care, the advantages of using binary format are well worth the extra effort. BioMOCA is now equipped with the tools to record the trajectory information in binary format.
