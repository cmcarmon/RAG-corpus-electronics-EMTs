A shorted resistor (resistance of 0 Ω) would theoretically draw inﬁnite current from any
ﬁnite source of voltage (I=E/0). In this case, the zero resistance of R2 decreases the circuit
total resistance to zero Ω as well, increasing total current to a value of inﬁnity. As long as the
voltage source holds steady at 9 volts, however, the other branch currents (IR1 and IR3) will
remain unchanged.
