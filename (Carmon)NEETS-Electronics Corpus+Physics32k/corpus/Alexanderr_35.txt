It should be noted that an ideal voltage source (dependent or inde-
pendent) will produce any current required to ensure that the terminal
voltage  is  as  stated,  whereas  an  ideal  current  source  will  produce  the
necessary  voltage  to  ensure  the  stated  current  ﬂow.  Thus,  an  ideal
source  could  in  theory  supply  an  inﬁnite  amount  of  energy.  It  should
also be noted that not only do sources supply power to a circuit, they
can  absorb  power  from  a  circuit  too.  For  a  voltage  source,  we  know
the  voltage  but  not  the  current  supplied  or  drawn  by  it.  By  the  same
token,  we  know  the  current  supplied  by  a  current  source  but  not  the
voltage across it.
