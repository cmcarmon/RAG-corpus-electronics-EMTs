If we can select the proper values of resistors, inductors, or capacitors, a FILTER NETWORK, or 
"frequency selector," can be produced which offers little opposition to one frequency, while BLOCKING 
or ATTENUATING other frequencies. A filter network can also be designed that will "pass" a band of 
frequencies and "reject" all other frequencies.
