This expression shows that for the non-inverting connection, the effective input
resistance in the active region is very high, (roughly the Op Amp input resis-
tance ri multiplied by the loop gain) in contrast to the result for the inverting
if we apply a voltage vt at the
case, Equation 15.38. Reasoning physically,

input, the output voltage adjusts itself so that v
is very nearly equal to vt,
so there is very little voltage across ri, hence much less current flowing in it
than we might expect. Hence the circuit input resistance is large. This prop-
erty enables the non-inverting connection to be particularly useful in buffering
applications.
