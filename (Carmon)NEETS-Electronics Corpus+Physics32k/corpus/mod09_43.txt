Examine figure 1-1. Notice that a basic tuned circuit consists of a coil and a capacitor, connected 
either in series, view (A), or in parallel, view (B). The resistance (R) in the circuit is usually limited to the 
inherent resistance of the components (particularly the resistance of the coil). For our purposes we are 
going to disregard this small resistance in future diagrams and explanations.
