In scale relativity, the cosmological constant is interpreted as a curvature. If one does a dimensional analysis, it is indeed the inverse of the square of a length. The predicted value of the cosmological constant, back in 1993 was:
ΩΛ h2 = 0.36
Depending on model choices, the most recent predictions give the following range:
0.311 < ΩΛ h2 (predicted) < 0.356,
while the measured cosmological constant from the Planck satellite is:
ΩΛ h2 (measured) = 0.318 ±0.012.
Given the improvements of the empirical measures from 1993 until 2011, Nottale commented:

The convergence of the observational values towards the theoretical estimate, despite an improvement of the precision by a factor of more than 20, is striking.

Dark energy can be considered as a measurement of the cosmological constant. In scale relativity, dark energy would come from a potential energy manifested by the fractal geometry of the universe at large scales, in the same way as the Newtonian potential is a manifestation of its curved geometry in general relativity.
