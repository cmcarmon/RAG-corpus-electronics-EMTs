	
If	you	are	familiar	with	each	of	its	components,	you	may	have	a	good	grasp	of	how	an
electronic	circuit	works;	granted	that	the	integral	parts	(e.g.	power	source,	conductor,
resistor,	diode,	etc.)	are	in	place,	and	you	were	introduced	to	different	techniques	on
establishing	connections	properly,	there’s	a	high	chance	that	any	circuit	project	you	take
on	can	be	a	success.	Once	an	opening	for	a	power	source	is	identified,	and	the	stability	of
an	arrangement	for	the	rest	in	a	series	is	achieved,	you’re	set.
However,	if	given	the	opportunity	to	make	a	particular	circuit	more	functional,	wouldn’t
you	take	it?	Instead	of	settling	for	a	random	circuit	design,	why	not	have	it	modified	for
superior	performance?
