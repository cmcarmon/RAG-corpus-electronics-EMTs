The voltage on a distribution circuit varies from a maximum
value at the consumer nearest to the source (ﬁrst consumer) to
a minimum value at the end of the circuit (last consumer). For
any given voltage level, the actual operating values can vary over
a large range. This range has been segmented into three zones:
(1) the favorable zone or preferred zone, (2) the tolerable
zone, and (3) the extreme zone. The favorable zone includes
the majority of the existing operating voltages that produce
satisfactory operation of the customer’s equipment. The toler-
able zone contains a band of operating voltages slightly above
and below the favorable zone. The operating voltages in the
