The final example is to assume that the rotation curve of the Galaxy is flat, i.e.



v


{\displaystyle v}
is constant and independent of radius,



r


{\displaystyle r}
. The rotation velocity is in between that of a solid body and of Keplerian rotation, and is the red dottedline in Figure 3. With a constant velocity, it follows that the radial derivative of



v


{\displaystyle v}
is 0,







d
v


d
r



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {dv}{dr}}=0}

and therefore the Oort constants are,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&A={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}-0{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}\right)\\&B=-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}+0{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)=-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}\right)\\\end{aligned}}}

Using the local velocity and radius given in the last example, one finds



A
=
13.6


{\displaystyle A=13.6}
km s−1 kpc−1 and



B
=
−
13.6


{\displaystyle B=-13.6}
km s−1 kpc−1. This is close to the actual measured Oort constants and tells us that the constant-speed model is the closest of these three to reality in the solar neighborhood. But in fact, as mentioned above,



−
A
−
B


{\displaystyle -A-B}
is negative, meaning that at our distance, speed decreases with distance from the centre of the galaxy.
What one should take away from these three examples, is that with a remarkably simple model, the rotation of the Milky Way can be described by these two constants. The first two examples are used as constraints to the Galactic rotation, for they show the fastest and slowest the Galaxy can rotate at a given radius. The flat rotation curve serves as an intermediate step between the two rotation curves, and in fact gives the most reasonable Oort constants as compared to current measurements.
