Figure 113.14(1)  shows  a  normal  ECG  and  Fig.  113.14(2)  illustrates  a  2/1 AV  block  with  two  P  waves  for
each  QRS-T  complex.  Complete  AV  block  exists  when  none  of  the  atrial  excitations  reach  the  AV  node,  as
shown in Fig. 113.14(3). In this case the ventricles developed their own rhythm, which was slow; cardiac output
is low, and in such a situation an artiÔ¨Åcial pacemaker must be implanted.
