Some  optical  disks  use  a  technique  called  constant  linear  velocity  (CLV),  where  the  platter  rotates  at  different  speeds
depending on the relative position of the track. This allows more data to be stored on the outer tracks than the inner tracks,
but because it takes more delay to vary the speed of rotation, the technique is better suited to sequential rather than random
access.
