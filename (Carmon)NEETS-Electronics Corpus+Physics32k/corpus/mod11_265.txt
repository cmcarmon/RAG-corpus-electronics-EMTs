SILICON BIPOLAR-TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIERS in integrated circuit form have been developed 
that provide up to 40 watts peak power in the 1- to 1.5-gigahertz range. Other types of microwave 
transistor amplifiers combined into multistage modules are capable of providing power outputs 
approaching 100 watts.
