The angular diameter distance is a distance measure used in astronomy. It is defined in terms of an object's physical size,



x


{\displaystyle x}
, and



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
the angular size of the object as viewed from earth.

{\displaystyle d_{A}={\frac {x}{\theta }}}

The angular diameter distance depends on the assumed cosmology of the universe. The angular diameter distance to an object at redshift,



z


{\displaystyle z}
, is expressed in terms of the comoving distance,



r


{\displaystyle r}
as:

{\displaystyle d_{A}={\frac {S_{k}(r)}{1+z}}}

In the currently favoured geometric model of our Universe, the "angular diameter distance" of an object is a good approximation to the "real distance", i.e. the proper distance when the light left the object. Note that beyond a certain redshift, the angular diameter distance gets smaller with increasing redshift. In other words, an object "behind" another of the same size, beyond a certain redshift (roughly z=1.5), appears larger on the sky, and would therefore have a smaller "angular diameter distance".
