Figure 83.32 shows the color dc plasma display structure [Koike et al., 1995]. The major difference between
the dc and ac structures is the placement of resistors in series with each sub-pixel to limit the discharge current
for the dc case as shown in Fig. 83.27. Another difference is the requirement for the dc device to have barrier
ribs on all four edges of each sub-pixel. This is needed to prevent the dc discharge from spreading to neighboring
sub-pixels  in  addition  to  the  color  purity  issue  discussed  above  for  ac  panels.  Unlike  the  single  substrate  ac
structure shown in Fig. 83.31, the alternate color phosphors are patterned along each row and each column in
