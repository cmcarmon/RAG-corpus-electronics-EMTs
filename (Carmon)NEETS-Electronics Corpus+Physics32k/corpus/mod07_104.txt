The N-type impurity loses its extra valence electron easily when added to a semiconductor material,
and in so doing, increases the conductivity of the material by contributing a free electron. This type of
impurity has 5 valence electrons and is called a PENTAVALENT impurity. Arsenic, antimony, bismuth,
and phosphorous are pentavalent impurities. Because these materials give or donate one electron to the
doped material, they are also called DONOR impurities.
