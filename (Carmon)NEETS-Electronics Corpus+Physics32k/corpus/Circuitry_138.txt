In many cases, Ohm’s Law alone is insufficient to 
determine  the  magnitude  of  the  voltages  and 
currents present in a circuit. This chapter introduces 
several techniques that simplify the task of solving 
complex circuits. It also  introduces the concept of 
exponential  growth  and  decay  of  voltage  and 
current  in  circuits  containing  capacitance  and 
resistance  and 
It 
concludes  by  showing  how  humble  C–R  circuits 
can  be  used  for  shaping  the  waveforms  found  in 
electronic circuits. We  start by introducing  two of 
the most useful laws of electronics.
