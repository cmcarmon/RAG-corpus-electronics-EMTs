Solution:
The circuit in Fig. 4.20 involves a voltage-controlled dependent current
source. We transform this dependent current source as well as the 6-V
independent voltage source as shown in Fig. 4.21(a). The 18-V voltage
source is not transformed because it is not connected in series with any
1-‚çÄ
resistor.  The  two 
resistor,  which  is  in  parallel  with  the  3-A current  source.  The  current
source  is  transformed  to  a  voltage  source  as  shown  in  Fig.  4.21(b).
Notice  that  the  terminals  for 
are  intact. Applying  KVL around  the
loop in Fig. 4.21(b) gives
