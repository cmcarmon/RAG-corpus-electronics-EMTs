Resonant Half-Wavelength Antenna
The  resonant  half-wavelength  antenna  (commonly  called  the  half-wave  dipole)  is  used  widely  in  antenna
systems. Factors contributing to its popularity are its well-understood radiation pattern, its simple construction,
its high efÔ¨Åciency, and its capability for easy impedance matching.
