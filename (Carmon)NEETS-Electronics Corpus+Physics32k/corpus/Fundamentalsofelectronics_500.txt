Problem 4.21: Unusual Amplitude Modulation
We want to send a band-limited signal having the depicted spectrum (Figure 4.29(a)) using amplitude
modulation. I.B. Diﬀerent suggests using the square-wave carrier shown below (Figure 4.29(b)). Well, it is
diﬀerent, but his friends wonder if any technique can demodulate it.
