Voltages, unlike current, can vary a lot, and transformers can
always be used to match voltages. Moreover, several levels of
voltages are used in one geographic area from the 110- or 220-V
single phase inside a residence to maybe a 765-KV three phase
for transmission, with Ô¨Åve or six intermediate levels in between.
In general, generators will produce electricity at low volt-
ages, up to about 20 KV for large generators, but this voltage
will be boosted immediately outside the generating stations to
high transmission level voltages by transformers. The advan-
tages of transmitting power at higher voltages are very easy to
see from equation 1.3. The same power transmitted at a higher
voltage requires less current. Less current implies that the
voltage drop IR and the power losses I 2R are both lower. Less
current also means that the wire size needed will be smaller,
which is a savings not just in the wire but in the whole
transmission structure.
