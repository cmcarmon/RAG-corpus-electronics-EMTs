Because the digits in a typical digital sequence ﬂuctuate randomly between 0s and 1s with
time, the formatted waveform is then a randomly ﬂuctuating set of pulses corresponding to the
selected format. With such random waveforms, one uses the power spectral density (with units of
V2/Hz) to deﬁne the spectral content. On comparing the three waveform formats, the unipolar and
polar formats both have the same bandwidth and relative side-lobe level, whereas the Manchester
waveform has no spectral component at direct current, but requires twice the bandwidth of the
other two signals.
