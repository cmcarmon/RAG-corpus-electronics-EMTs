Figure 7.21 shows the current and voltage at the 
input  of  a  common-emitter  amplifier  stage  while 
Fig.  7.22  shows  how 
input 
resistance,  Rin, appears  between  the  base  and 
emitter. Note that Rin is not a discrete component it 
is inside the transistor. From the foregoing we can 
deduce that:
