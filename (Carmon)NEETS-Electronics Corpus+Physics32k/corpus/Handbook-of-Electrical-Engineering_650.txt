Performance Evaluation
The noise performance of a digital modulation scheme is characterized by plotting the bit error rate (BER) as
a function of the ratio of the energy per bit to the noise spectial density. (Eb/N0). The simulated noise perfor-
mance of noncoherent CSK, COOK, and DCSK/FM-DCSK is summarized graphically in Fig. 5.35.
