• A passive SSR countermeasure scheme [see Edris, 1990] involves using three different combinations of
inductive and capacitive elements on the three phases. The combinations will exhibit the required equal
degree of capacitive compensation in the three phases at power frequency. At any other frequency, the
three combinations will appear as unequal reactances in the three phases. In this manner, asynchronous
oscillations  will  drive  unsymmetrical  three-phase  currents  in  the  generator’s  armature  windings.  This
creates  an  mmf  with  a  circular  component  of  a  lower  magnitude,  compared  with  the  corresponding
component if the currents were symmetrical. The developed interacting electromagnetic torque will be
lower.
