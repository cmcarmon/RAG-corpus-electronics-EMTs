In figure 3-17, resistors were used to show impedance characteristics for the sake of simplicity.
Figuring the actual impedance of a line having reactance is very similar, with inductance taking the place
of the series resistors and capacitance taking the place of the shunt resistors. The characteristic impedance
of lines in actual use normally lies between 50 and 600 ohms.
