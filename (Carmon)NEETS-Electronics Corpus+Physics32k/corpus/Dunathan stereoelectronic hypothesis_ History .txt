Before the correlation between fold type and reaction correlation of proteins were understood, Harmon C. Dunathan, a chemist at Haverford College proposed that the bond that is cleaved using pyridoxal is perpendicular to the system. Though an important concept in bioorganic chemistry, it is now known that enzyme conformations play a critical role in the final chemical reaction.
