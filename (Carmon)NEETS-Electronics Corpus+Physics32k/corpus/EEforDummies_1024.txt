I highly recommend that you use a solderless breadboard (or two) when you 
first build a circuit. That way, you can test the circuit to make sure it works 
properly and make any necessary adjustments. Often you can improve the 
performance of a circuit just by tweaking a few component values. You can 
easily make such changes by simply removing one component and inserting 
another on the board — without having to unsolder and resolder. (For the 
details of soldering, flip to the “Soldering 101” section, later in this chapter.)
