‘‘Modern’’ bipolar transistor models employ, one way
or the other, the integral charge-control relation (ICCR),
which was ﬁrst proposed by Gummel (1970). Under the
assumption of a negligible time dependence @n=@t
in the
the (electron) transfer
1-D electron continuity equation,
current from the emitter contact x ¼ 0 to the internal collector
contact at xc can be written in a simple form (Rein et al.,
1985):
