The MAGNETRON, shown in figure 2-17A, is a self-contained microwave oscillator that operates 
differently from the linear-beam tubes, such as the twt and the klystron. Figure 2-17B is a simplified 
drawing of the magnetron. CROSSED-ELECTRON and MAGNETIC fields are used in the magnetron to 
produce the high-power output required in radar and communications equipment.
