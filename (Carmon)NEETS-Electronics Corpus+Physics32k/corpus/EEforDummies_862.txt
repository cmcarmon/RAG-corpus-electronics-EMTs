Where you put your workshop is just as important as the projects you make 
and the tools you use. Just as in real estate, the guiding words for electronics 
work are location, location, location. By staking out just the right spot in your 
house or apartment, youâ€™ll be better organized and enjoy your experiments 
much more. Nothing is worse than working with a messy workbench in dim 
lighting while breathing stale air.
