The collision happened at around 2:35 a.m. in Cayce, about 4 miles southwest of Columbia. An Amtrak Silver Star passenger train with 139 passengers and 8 crew on board was traveling south from New York to Miami when it collided with an empty freight train operated by CSX Transportation. The Silver Star was hauled by GE P42DC locomotive â„– 47, while the CSX train was headed by two GE AC4400CWs. As a result of the collision, the lead engine and "several cars" of the Amtrak train derailed, killing 2 crew members and injuring 116 of the 147 people on board. The lead locomotive of the CSX train was severely damaged.
Injured passengers were taken to several local hospitals, but none had life-threatening injuries, according to a Lexington County spokesman. There were at least two fuel leaks from the trains, with an estimated 5,000 gallons of fuel being spilled before a hazardous materials team was able to contain the area.
