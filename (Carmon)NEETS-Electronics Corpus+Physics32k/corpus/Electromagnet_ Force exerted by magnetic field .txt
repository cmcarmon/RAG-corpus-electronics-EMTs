The force exerted by an electromagnet on a section of core material is:

{\displaystyle F={\frac {B^{2}A}{2\mu _{0}}}\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad (2)\,}

The force equation can be derived from the energy stored in a magnetic field. Energy is force times distance. Rearranging terms yields the equation above.
The 1.6 T limit on the field mentioned above sets a limit on the maximum force per unit core area, or pressure, an iron-core electromagnet can exert; roughly:

{\displaystyle {\frac {F}{A}}={\frac {B_{sat}^{2}}{2\mu _{0}}}\approx 1000\ \mathrm {kPa} =10^{6}\mathrm {N/m^{2}} =145\ \mathrm {lbf} \cdot \mathrm {in} ^{-2}\,}

In more intuitive units it's useful to remember that at 1T the magnetic pressure is approximately 4 atmospheres, or kg/cm2.
Given a core geometry, the B field needed for a given force can be calculated from (2); if it comes out to much more than 1.6 T, a larger core must be used.
