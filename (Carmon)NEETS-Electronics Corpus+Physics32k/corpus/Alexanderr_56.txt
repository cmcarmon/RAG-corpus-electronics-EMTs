In  this  chapter,  in  addition  to  these  laws,  we  shall  discuss  some
techniques commonly applied in circuit design and analysis. These tech-
niques include combining resistors in series or parallel, voltage division,
current division, and delta-to-wye and wye-to-delta transformations. The
application  of  these  laws  and  techniques  will  be  restricted  to  resistive
circuits in this chapter. We will Ô¨Ånally apply the laws and techniques to
real-life problems of electrical lighting and the design of dc meters.
