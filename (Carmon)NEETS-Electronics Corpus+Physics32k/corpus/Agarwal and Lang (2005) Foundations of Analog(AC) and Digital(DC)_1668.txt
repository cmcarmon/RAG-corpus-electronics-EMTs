Implement the logic function F = AB + CD with an NMOS digital logic circuit that
obeys the static discipline defined by the low-level and high-level logic thresholds
VIL = VOL = VL and VIH = VOH = VH, respectively. Assume the supply voltage
is VS, and that the on-state resistance of the NMOS transistors is RON. Determine
the lowest value of the pull-up resistor RPU for which the circuit will obey the static
discipline in terms of RON, VS, VL, and VH; not all variables need appear in your
answer.
Implement the logic function F = AB+ CD with a CMOS digital logic circuit. (Hint:
make use of the result from part (a).)
