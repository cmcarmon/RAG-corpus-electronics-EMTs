By considering the supply voltage within each branch and the resistance within each branch,
Millman’s Theorem will tell us the voltage across all branches. Please note that I’ve labeled
the battery in the rightmost branch as “B3” to clearly denote it as being in the third branch,
even though there is no “B2” in the circuit!
