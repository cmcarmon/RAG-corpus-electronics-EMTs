When a system of sources is so large that its voltage and frequency remain constant regardless
of the power delivered or absorbed, it is known as an inﬁnite bus. Such a bus (node) has a voltage
and a frequency that are unaffected by external disturbances. The inﬁnite bus is treated as an ideal
voltage source. Even though, for simplicity, only resistive networks are considered in this section,
the concept of equivalent circuits is also employed in ac sinusoidal steady-state circuit analysis
of networks consisting of inductors and capacitors, as we shall see in Chapter 3.
