The galvanometer is used to measure very low currents, such as those in bridge circuits. In modified
form, the galvanometer has the highest sensitivity of any of the various types of meters in use today. A
simplified diagram of a galvanometer is shown in figure 3-1. It is different from other instruments used
for the same purpose because its movable coil is suspended by means of metal ribbons instead of a shaft
and jewel-bearing arrangement often used in other instruments.
