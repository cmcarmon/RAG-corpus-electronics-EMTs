Circuit Wizard allows the operator to change 
the circuit appearance when it is running a simu-
lation. Features of Circuit Wizard PCB fabrication 
 (Figure 6-4) include these:
■● PCB components—Circuit Wizard has over 1500 
PCB components covering all the typical devices. 
For each component, there is a layout symbol and 
a simulation model, which means that any PCB 
drawn can be simulated.
