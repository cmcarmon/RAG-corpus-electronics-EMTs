The  error  in  Eq.  (61.46)  is  only  4.3%  at u  =  60 degrees  (maximum  overlap  angle  for  normal  steady-state
operation), and it will be even lower (1.1%) for most practical cases when u is 30 degrees or less. It can be seen
from Eqs. (61.45) and (61.46) that the ratio between ac and dc currents is almost ﬁxed, but the ratio between
ac and dc voltages varies as a function of a  and u. Hence the HVDC converter can be viewed as a variable-
ratio voltage transformer, with almost ﬁxed current ratio.
