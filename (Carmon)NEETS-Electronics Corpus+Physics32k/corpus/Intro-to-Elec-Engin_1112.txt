Elementary Direct-Current Machines
A preliminary discussion of dc machines, including Equations (12.2.14) through (12.2.18), was
presented in Section 12.2. The location of the brushes on the commutator arrangement connected
to the armature winding ensures that the rotor and stator mmf axes are at all times at right angles
to one another, as shown in Figure 12.2.4. The expression for torque given by Equation (12.4.32)
is applicable to the dc machine, provided the constant K is adjusted for the nonsinusoidal mmf
distributions and sin δ is made equal to unity. Not only are the conditions for constant torque
fulﬁlled, but also the condition for maximum torque and hence for maximum energy conversion
is satisﬁed, since δ = ±π/2, depending upon whether generator or motor action occurs for a
given direction of rotation.
