the surface of a tiny reflective diaphragm. As the diaphragm moves, 
changes in light reflected off the diaphragm are picked up by a detector, 
which transforms the differences in light into an electrical signal. Fiber‚Äê
optic microphones are immune to both electromagnetic interference 
(EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI).
