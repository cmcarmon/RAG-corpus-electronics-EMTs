Medium-scale integration: A single packaged IC device with 12 to 99 gate-equivalent circuits.
Race-free state assignment: A state assignment made for asynchronous sequential logic circuits such that no
more than a one-bit change occurs between each stable state transition, thus preventing possible critical races.
Sequential logic circuit: A circuit with output signals that are dependent on all or part of the present state
