Circuit/System Reset Requirements. A simple and straightforward mechanism for resetting a digital circuit
to a known state is an essential requirement for testability. It should be noted that the requirement is not only
for having the reset function provided but further that it should be simple to execute. For example, applying
a deÔ¨Åned sequence of external signals to a circuit which must be synchronized with a free-running clock signal
would not be considered a simple reset mechanism. Instead, keeping an external signal at some logic value for
a  minimum  duration  is  a  much  more  desirable  approach.  It  is  very  desirable  that  the  reset  function  be
asynchronous (i.e., not require system clock pulses to execute) since during power-up a circuit may need to be
reset even before free-running clock pulses can be started.
