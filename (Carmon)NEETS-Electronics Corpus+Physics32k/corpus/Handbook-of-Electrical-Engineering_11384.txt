Ultrasound, acoustic waves at frequencies higher than those audible by humans, has developed over the past
35 years into an indispensable clinical diagnostic tool. Currently, ultrasound is used to image most parts of the
body. More than half of all pregnant women in the United States are examined with ultrasound. This widespread
utilization  has  resulted  from  ultrasoundâ€™s  proven  clinical  utility  for  imaging  soft  tissues  compared  to  more
expensive  imaging  techniques.  The  development  of  ultrasound,  particularly  for  fetal  examinations,  has  also
been fostered by its safety record; no case of an adverse biological effect induced by diagnostic ultrasound has
ever been reported in humans [AIUM, 1988].
