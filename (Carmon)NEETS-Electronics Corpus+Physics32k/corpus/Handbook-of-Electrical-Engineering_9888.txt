In a single-loop feedback system, a series equalizer is placed in the single loop, generally at
a point along the forward path from input to output where the equalizer itself consumes only a small
amount  of  energy.  In  Fig.  100.21,  G1(s)  could  represent  a  series  equalizer.  G1(s)  could  also  be  a  series
equalizer if G4(s) = 0.
