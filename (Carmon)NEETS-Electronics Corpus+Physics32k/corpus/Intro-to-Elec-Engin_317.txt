3.4.8 Let a square-wave voltage source having an am-
plitude of 5 V, a frequency of 1 kHz, a pulse width
of 0.5 ms, and an internal source resistance of
50  be applied to a resistive load of 100 . A
ﬁlter (inductance L) is inserted between source
and load in order to reduce all the high-frequency
components above 5 kHz. Determine (a) L of the
low-pass ﬁlter, (b) amplitude spectra of VL and VS,
and (c) vL(t ).
