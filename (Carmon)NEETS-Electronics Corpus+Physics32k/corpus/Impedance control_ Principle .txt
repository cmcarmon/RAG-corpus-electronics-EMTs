Impedance control doesn't simply regulate force or position of a mechanism. Instead it regulates the relationship between force on the one hand and position, velocity and acceleration on the other hand, i.e. the impedance of the mechanism. It requires a position (velocity or acceleration) as input and has a resulting force as output. The inverse of impedance is admittance. It imposes position. So actually the controller imposes a spring-mass-damper behavior on the mechanism by maintaining a dynamic relationship between force and position, velocity and acceleration: F = Ma + Cv + Kx + friction + static force.
Mass and spring (stiffness) are energy storing elements, while a damper is an energy dissipating element. So if we can control impedance, we are able to control energy exchange during interaction, i.e. the work being done. So impedance control is interaction control.
Note that mechanical systems are inherently multi-dimensional - a typical robot arm can place an object in three dimensions (x, y, z coordinates) and in three orientations (e.g. roll, pitch, yaw). In theory, an impedance controller can cause the mechanism to exhibit a multi-dimensional mechanical impedance. For example, the mechanism might act very stiff along one axis and very compliant along another. By compensating for the kinematics and inertias of the mechanism, we can orient those axes arbitrarily and in various coordinate systems. For example, we might cause a robotic part holder to be very stiff tangentially to a grinding wheel, while being very compliant (controlling force with little concern for position) in the radial axis of the wheel.
