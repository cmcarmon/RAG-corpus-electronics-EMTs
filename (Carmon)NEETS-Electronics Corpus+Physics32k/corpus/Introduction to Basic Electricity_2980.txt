When pure semiconductor material is doped with 
a pentavalent material such as arsenic (As), some of 
the existing atoms are displaced with arsenic  atoms 
( Figure 28-6). The arsenic atom shares four of its 
 valence  electrons with adjacent silicon atoms in a 
 covalent bond. Its fifth electron is loosely attached to 
the nucleus and is easily set free.
