The SYNCHRO RECEIVER (TR) is electrically identical to the synchro transmitter. The receiver, 
however, uses some form of rotor damping that is not present in the transmitter. This real difference 
between a synchro transmitter and a synchro receiver lies in their applications. The receiver converts the 
electrical data, supplied to its stator from the transmitter, back to a mechanical angular output through the 
movement of its rotor.
