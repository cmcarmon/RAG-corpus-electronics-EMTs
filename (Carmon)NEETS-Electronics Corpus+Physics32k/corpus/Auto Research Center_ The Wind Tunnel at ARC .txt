The wind tunnel at ARC was designed with the automotive industry in mind. The tunnel is a 3/4 open plenum configuration with an optional rolling road and primary and secondary boundary layer control treatments. The tunnel nozzle has a cross section that is 2.3 m wide by 2.1 m high. Force measurements are gathered utilizing a 6 degree of freedom balance mounted internally between the tested model a vertical sting. The balance includes an integrated model motion system capable of automated pitch, roll, yaw, and vertical translation with laser measurement feedback. Additional capabilities can be included in the model for incorporation automatically or dependently controlled motors (i.e. wheel steer). In addition to force measurements the tunnel has capabilities for pressure tap measurements, anemometer measurements, and flow visualization including tufts and oil droplets. Beyond the standard test measurements new capabilities have been added for measuring torque and rotation rate, as well as braking controls for wind turbine experiments.
