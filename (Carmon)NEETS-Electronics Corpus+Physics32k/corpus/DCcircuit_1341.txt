Because magnetically-induced voltage only happens when the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux is chang-
ing in strength relative to the wire, mutual inductance between two coils can only happen with
alternating (changing – AC) voltage, and not with direct (steady – DC) voltage. The only ap-
plications for mutual inductance in a DC system is where some means is available to switch
power on and off to the coil (thus creating a pulsing DC voltage), the induced voltage peaking
at every pulse.
