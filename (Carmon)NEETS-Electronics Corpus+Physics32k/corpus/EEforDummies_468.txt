Drawing the (flux) lines with magnets
Just as electricity involves a force (voltage) between two electrical charges, 
magnetism involves a force between two magnetic poles. If you’ve ever per-
formed the classic grade‐school science experiment in which you place a 
magnet on a surface and toss a bunch of iron filings near the magnet, you’ve 
seen the effects of magnetic force. Remember what happened to the filings? 
They settled into curved linear paths from the north pole of the magnet to 
its south pole. Those filings showed you the magnetic lines of force — also 
known as flux lines — within the magnetic field created by the magnet. You 
may have seen more filings closer to the magnet because that’s where the 
magnetic field is strongest. Figure 8-1 shows the pattern produced by invis-
ible lines of flux around a magnet.
