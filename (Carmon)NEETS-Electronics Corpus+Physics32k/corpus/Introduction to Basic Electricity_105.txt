Ohm’s	Law,	named	after	the	German	scientist,	Georg	Simon	Ohm,	is	a	powerful
law	that	describes	the	resistance	and	electric	current	in	a	circuit,	as	well	as	their
potential	difference.	Particularly,	it	sheds	light	on	2	points,	then,	subjects	them	to
further	analysis.	Consequently,	the	relationship	between	Point	A	and	Point	B	will
indicate	each	of	their	properties	as	individual	components.
In	the	verge	of	learning	its	concepts,	it	will	dawn	on	you	that	Ohm’s	Law	is	an
empirical	matter.	After	observations	with	different	ranges	of	length	scales,	it	was
proposed	that	it	would	fail	where	small	wires	are	concerned;	however,	this	proved
to	be	a	mere	assumption	since	it	was	discovered	that	it	could	function	regardless	of
a	wire’s	size.
Since	it	is	a	basic	equation	in	circuit	engineering,	Ohm’s	Law	can	also	be	applied
for	the	determination	of	metal	conductivity;	it	can	be	relied	on	when	it	comes	to
understanding	the	electric	flow	and	conductive	aspect	in	a	circuit’s	component.
Various	materials	that	make	use	of	Georg	Ohm’s	principles	are	referred	to	as
ohmic.
