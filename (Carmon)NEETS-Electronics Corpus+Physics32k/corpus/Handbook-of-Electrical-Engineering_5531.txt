The behavior and response of the FC-TCR type of compensator under large disturbances is uncontrollable,
at  least  during  the  ﬁrst  few  cycles  following  the  disturbance.  The  resulting  voltage  transients  are  essentially
determined by the ﬁxed capacitor and the power system impedance. This can lead to overvoltage and resonance
problems.
