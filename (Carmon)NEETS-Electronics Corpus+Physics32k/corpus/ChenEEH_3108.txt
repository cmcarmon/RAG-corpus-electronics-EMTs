At steady state, the three-phase stator winding produces
a magnetic ﬁeld rotating at synchronous speed. The rotor
rotates at a speed slightly less than synchronous speed. The
low-frequency currents induced on the rotor produce a ﬁeld
that also travels at synchronous speed. There is a ﬁxed angle
between these two ﬁelds. They react with each other to pro-
duce a constant torque. This is illustrated schematically in
Figure 4.16.
