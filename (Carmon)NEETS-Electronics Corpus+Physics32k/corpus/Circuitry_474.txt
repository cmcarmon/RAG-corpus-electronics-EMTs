NAND gates (Fig. 10.13) 
 
NAND (i.e. NOT-AND) gates will only produce a 
logic 0 output when all inputs are simultaneously at 
logic 1. Any other input combination will produce a 
logic 1 output. A NAND gate, therefore, is nothing 
more  than  an  AND  gate  with  its  output  inverted! 
The  circle  shown  at  the  output  denotes  this 
inversion.  The  Boolean  expression  for  the  output, 
Y, of a NAND gate with inputs, A and B, is:
