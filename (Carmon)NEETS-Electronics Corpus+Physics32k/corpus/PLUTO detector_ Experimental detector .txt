PLUTO was the first electromagnetic superconductive solenoid in the world, with a very uniform axial magnetic field of 12000 Gauss, to operate in a straight section of e+eâˆ’ accelerators at DESY, first with DORIS I (a storage ring at center of mass energies of ~3-5 GeV) in 1974-1976, then with DORIS II (the upgraded storage ring of DORIS I at center of mass energies of ~7-10 Gev) in 1978 and later with PETRA (also a storage ring, at larger center of mass energies of ~10-45 GeV) in 1978-1982 (see review).
