The rate of charge for the capacitor is limited only by the resistance of the conducting diode which is 
relatively low. Therefore, the RC charge time of the circuit is relatively short. As a result, when the 
pulsating voltage is first applied to the circuit, the capacitor charges rapidly and almost reaches the peak 
value of the rectified voltage within the first few cycles. The capacitor attempts to charge to the peak 
value of the rectified voltage anytime a diode is conducting, and tends to retain its charge when the
