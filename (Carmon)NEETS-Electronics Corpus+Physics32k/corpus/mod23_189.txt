There are two basic tape reeling configurations: (1) co-planar, and (2) co-axial. Both of these 
describe the physical relationship between the supply reel and the take-up reel. The co-planar, which is 
used more often than the co-axial, has the supply reel and the take-up reel side by side. Figure 4-7 shows 
this configuration.
