The simply symmetric charge distributions examined here
are the only type of source distributions that can be solved by
direct application of Gauss’s law, equation 2.5. To ﬁnd the ﬁeld
of more general (and realistic) charge distributions, a connec-
tion between a source charge and the D ﬁeld it produces is
needed.
