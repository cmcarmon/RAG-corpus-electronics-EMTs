where ETt represents the causal relationship of ﬁring transition
t. Intuitively, each inference rule states if a place loses tokens
from one marking to another, then some relevant transition
must have ﬁred (He and Ding, 1992). The variables are uni-
versally quantiﬁed and are omitted for simplicity. The above
inference rules only reﬂect the local state changes. Together
with system independent axioms and inference rules (Manna
and Pnueli, 1992, 1995), we can use IC and PRp to prove a
variety of safety properties.
