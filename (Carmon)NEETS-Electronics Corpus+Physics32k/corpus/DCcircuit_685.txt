than the resistances of the divider resistors. But there always will be some degree of loading,
causing the meter to indicate less than the true voltage with no meter connected. Obviously,
the higher the voltmeter resistance, the less loading of the circuit under test, and that is why
an ideal voltmeter has inﬁnite internal resistance.
