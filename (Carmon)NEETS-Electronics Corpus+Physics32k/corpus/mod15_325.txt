Now, compare the spin (X) axis in the two parts of figure 3-7. In view A, the spin axis is vertical. In 
view B, the spin axis has moved from the vertical until it is much closer to being horizontal. By applying 
the right amount of force in the right place, we have a method of "aiming" the spin axis so that it points to 
the specific fixed direction in space where we want it. The property of PRECESSION makes the property 
of RIGIDITY useable.
