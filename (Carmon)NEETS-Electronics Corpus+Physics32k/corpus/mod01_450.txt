if any two quantities are known, the third one can be determined. Refer to figure 3-2(B), the
schematic of the flashlight. If the battery (BAT) supplies a voltage of 1.5 volts and the lamp (DS1) has a
resistance of 5 ohms, then the current in the circuit can be determined. Using this equation and
substituting values:
