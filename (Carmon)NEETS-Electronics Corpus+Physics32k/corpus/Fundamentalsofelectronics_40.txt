Problem 1.3: Advanced Modems
To transmit symbols, such as letters of the alphabet, RU computer modems use two frequencies (1600
and 1800 Hz) and several amplitude levels. A transmission is sent for a period of time T (known as the
transmission or baud interval) and equals the sum of two amplitude-weighted carriers.
