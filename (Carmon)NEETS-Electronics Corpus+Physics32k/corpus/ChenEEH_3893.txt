Following the particular structure provided by the MPEG-7
transcoding hints, consider that each region Ri has an import-
ance Ii and spatial resolution hint Si. Consider also that each
region has a content value score Vi after rescaling the image
globally using rescaling factor L, which is a function of its im-
portance Ii and spatial resolution hint Si. Rescaling goes as
follows:
