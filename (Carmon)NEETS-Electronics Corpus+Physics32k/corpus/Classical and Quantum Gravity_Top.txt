Classical and Quantum Gravity is a peer-reviewed journal that covers all aspects of gravitational physics and the theory of spacetime. Its scope includes:
Classical general relativity
Applications of relativity
Experimental gravitation
Cosmology and the early universe
Quantum gravity
Supergravity, superstrings and supersymmetry
Mathematical physics relevant to gravitation
The editor-in-chief is Clifford M Will at the University of Florida. The 2013 impact factor is 3.103 according to Journal Citation Reports. As of October 2015, the journal publishes letters in addition to regular articles.
As a companion to the main journal, there is a website CQG+ that highlights high quality papers published in the journal and to raise the visibility of those papers. This has also featured film reviews related to gravity such as Interstellar and The Theory of Everything .
Classical and Quantum Gravity also supports the field of gravitational physics through sponsorship of the British Gravity Meeting.
