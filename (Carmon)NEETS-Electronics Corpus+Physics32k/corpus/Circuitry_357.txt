The input resistance of a transistor is the resistance 
that 
input 
terminals.  As  such,  it  is  the  ratio  of  the  voltage 
between the input terminals to the current flowing 
into the input. In the case of a transistor operating 
in  common-emitter  mode,  the  input  voltage  is  the 
voltage  developed  between  the  base  and  emitter, 
Vbe, while the input current is the current supplied
