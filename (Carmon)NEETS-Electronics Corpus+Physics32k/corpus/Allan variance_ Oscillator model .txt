The oscillator being analysed is assumed to follow the basic model of




V
(
t
)
=

V

0


sin
⁡
(
Φ
(
t
)
)
.


{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{0}\sin(\Phi (t)).}

The oscillator is assumed to have a nominal frequency of




ν

n




{\displaystyle \nu _{\text{n}}}
, given in cycles per second (SI unit: hertz). The nominal angular frequency




ω

n




{\displaystyle \omega _{\text{n}}}
(in radians per second) is given by





ω

n


=
2
π

ν

n


.


{\displaystyle \omega _{\text{n}}=2\pi \nu _{\text{n}}.}

The total phase can be separated into a perfectly cyclic component




ω

n


t


{\displaystyle \omega _{\text{n}}t}
, along with a fluctuating component



ϕ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \phi (t)}
:




Φ
(
t
)
=

ω

n


t
+
ϕ
(
t
)
=
2
π

ν

n


t
+
ϕ
(
t
)
.


{\displaystyle \Phi (t)=\omega _{\text{n}}t+\phi (t)=2\pi \nu _{\text{n}}t+\phi (t).}
