The ”alpha” (α) constant is known as the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance, and sym-
bolizes the resistance change factor per degree of temperature change. Just as all materials
have a certain speciﬁc resistance (at 20o C), they also change resistance according to tempera-
ture by certain amounts. For pure metals, this coefﬁcient is a positive number, meaning that
resistance increases with increasing temperature. For the elements carbon, silicon, and germa-
nium, this coefﬁcient is a negative number, meaning that resistance decreases with increasing
temperature. For some metal alloys, the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance is very close to
zero, meaning that the resistance hardly changes at all with variations in temperature (a good
property if you want to build a precision resistor out of metal wire!). The following table gives
the temperature coefﬁcients of resistance for several common metals, both pure and alloy:
