  form  for  the  model  equations  and  then
uses available measurements to estimate the coefﬁcient values that cause the assumed form to best ﬁt the data.
The assumed form could be based upon physical knowledge or it could be just a credible assumption. Time-
series models include autoregressive (AR) models, moving average (MA) models, and the combination, called
ARMA models. All are difference equations relating the input variables to the output variables at the discrete
measurement times, of the form
