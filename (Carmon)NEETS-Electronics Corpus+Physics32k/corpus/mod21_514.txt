The information desired from the spectra to be analyzed determines the SPECTRUM ANALYZER 
requirements. Real-time analysis is used if a particular point in the frequency spectrum is to be analyzed, 
such as a line spectra display. Continuous- or swept-frequency analysis, which is the most common mode 
of observation, is used to display a wider portion of the frequency spectrum or (in some cases) the entire 
range of the spectrum analyzer in use. Changing the spectrum analyzer setting from one mode to another 
is accomplished by varying the scan time and the bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer or a combination of 
the two. Most real-time spectrum analyzers, however, are preceded by mechanical filters, which limit the 
input bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer to the desired spectra to be analyzed. Tunable- or swept-
spectrum analyzers function basically the same as heterodyne receivers, the difference being that the local 
oscillator is not used but is replaced by a voltage-controlled oscillator (vco). The vco is swept 
electronically by a ramp input from a sawtooth generator. The output of the receiver is applied to a crt, 
which has its horizontal sweep in synchronization with the vco. The lower frequency appears at the left of 
the crt display. As the trace sweeps to the right, the oscillator increases in frequency. Figure 5-24 is a 
block diagram of a heterodyne spectrum analyzer.
