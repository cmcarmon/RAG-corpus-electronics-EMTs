DSP is attributed by its data ﬂow and real-time computing
nature. This dictates the implementation of a high-throughput
DSP application as a dedicated chip called ASIC. A broad
range of DSP applications include seismic/radar/sonar/radio
signal processing, human/computer/machine interface, storage
and communication, and security/military operations. As
such, a variety of data types, algorithm constructs, and sam-
pling rates are involved. Data type can be either bit-level or bit-
parallel (ﬁxed-point/ﬂoating-point number). The algorithm
can be described as a nonterminating/terminating nested
