COMMUTATION IN A DC MOTOR is the process of reversing armature current at the moment 
when unlike poles of the armature and field are facing each other, thereby reversing the polarity of the 
armature field. Like poles of the armature and field then repel each other, causing armature rotation to 
continue.
