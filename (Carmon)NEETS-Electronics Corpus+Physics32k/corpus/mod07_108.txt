electron short of the required amount of electrons needed to form covalent bonds with 4 neighboring
atoms and, therefore, creates a hole in the structure. Gallium and boron, which are also trivalent
impurities, exhibit these same characteristics when added to germanium. The holes can only be present in
this type semiconductor when a trivalent impurity is used. Note that a hole carrier is not created by the
removal of an electron from a neutral atom, but is created when a trivalent impurity enters into covalent
bonds with a tetravalent (4 valence electrons) crystal structure. The holes in this type of semiconductor
(P-type) are considered the MAJORITY carriers since they are present in the material in the greatest
quantity. The electrons, on the other hand, are the MINORITY carriers.
