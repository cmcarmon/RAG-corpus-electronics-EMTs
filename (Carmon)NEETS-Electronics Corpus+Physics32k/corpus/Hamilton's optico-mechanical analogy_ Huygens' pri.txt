The propagation of light can be considered in terms of rays and wavefronts in ordinary physical three-dimensional space. One may consider an inhomogeneous anisotropic medium with smoothly distributed properties that are described by an index of refraction that is a well-behaved function of position. Huygens' principle governs the propagation of a wavefront as it can be derived from Fermat's principle. The wavefronts are two-dimensional curved surfaces. The rays are one-dimensional curved lines.
Thus, a wave is a foliated set of moving two-dimensional surfaces. In classical physics, it is not part of the definition of a wave that it be distinctly vibratory.
One difference between wave and particle conceptions is thus in the spatial dimensionality of their moving objects.
On one hand, a ray can be regarded as the orbit of a particle of light. It successively punctures the wave surfaces. The successive punctures can be regarded as defining the trajectory of the particle.
On the other hand, a wave-front can be regarded as a level surface of displacement of some quantity, such as electric field intensity, hydrostatic pressure, particle number density, oscillatory phase, or probability amplitude. Then the physical meaning of the rays is less evident.
This is waveâ€“particle duality for a single particle in ordinary three-dimensional physical space or for a wave of some property of a medium with a spatial distribution of properties that is mostly continuous but not homogeneous.
