In figure 3-2, the transistor has two inputs (the emitter and the base) and one output (the collector).
Remember, the current through the transistor (and therefore the output signal) is controlled by the
base-to-emitter bias. In the circuit shown in figure 3-2, the combination of the two input signals controls
the output signal. In fact, the DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE INPUT SIGNALS determines the
base-to-emitter bias.
