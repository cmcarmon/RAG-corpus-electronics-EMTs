A communications receiver must extract the modulation from a radio frequency carrier. A PLL may be used
by phase locking a VCO to the received input signal. The loop ﬁlter output will then contain the extracted FM
signal, and the loop ﬁlter input will contain the PM signal. In this case the frequency response of the FM output
will be a low-pass function described by the closed-loop transfer function and the PM output response will be
a high-pass function described by the error function.
