Alternately,  the  multipath  returns  that  are  separated  by  more  than  a  chip  duration  from  the  main  path
represent  independent “looks”  at  the  received  signal  and  can  be  used  constructively  to  enhance  the  overall
performance of the receiver. That is, because all of the multipath returns contain information regarding the
data that is being sent, that information can be extracted by an appropriately designed receiver. Such a receiver,
typically referred to as a RAKE receiver, attempts to resolve as many individual multipath returns as possible
and then to sum them coherently. This results in an implicit diversity gain, comparable to the use of explicit
diversity, such as receiving the signal with multiple antennas.
