So what should the PCB prototype look like? 
First, it depends on the ability to read a schematic	
	diagram. Second, it depends on the overall goal, to 
make the smallest PCB, to fit a certain shape, to fit a 
certain location, and so on. If possible, itâ€™s a good idea 
to start with paper dolls (Chapter 48) and progress 
from there.
