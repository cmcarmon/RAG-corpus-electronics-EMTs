FM, with its high level of noise immunity, and hence power efﬁciency, is widely used
on high-ﬁdelity radio broadcasting and power-critical communication links such as point-to-
point communication systems. It is also employed for satellite links and voice transmission on
microwave LOS systems. When the transmitted power is a major concern, conventional AM
and VSB (being the least power-efﬁcient systems) are not used, unless their development can be
justiﬁed by the simplicity of the receiver structure.
