Plasma rail guns are capable of producing controlled jets of given densities and velocities ranging from at least peak densities 1e13 to 1e16 (units?) with velocities from 5 to 200 km/s dependent on device design configuration and operating parameters. Plasma rail guns are being evaluated for applications in magnetic confinement fusion for disruption mitigation and tokamak refueling.
Magneto-inertial fusion seeks to implode a magnetized D-T fusion target using a spherically-symmetric, collapsing, conducting liner. Plasma railguns are being evaluated as a possible method of implosion linear formation for fusion.
Arrays of plasma railguns could be used to create pulsed implosions of ~1 Megabar peak pressure, allowing more access to chart this opening area of plasma physics
High velocity jets of controllable density and temperature allow astrophysical phenomena such as solar wind, galactic jets, solar events and astrophysical plasma to be partially simulated in the laboratory and measured directly, in addition to astronomic and satellite observations.
