Semi-amplitude means 1/2(Half) of the peak-to-peak amplitude. Some scientists use amplitude or peak amplitude to mean semi-amplitude.
It is the most widely used measure of orbital wobble in astronomy and the measurement of small radial velocity semi-amplitudes of nearby stars is important in the search for exoplanets (see Doppler spectroscopy).
