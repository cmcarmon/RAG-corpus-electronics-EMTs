Skyboard is a one-person glider that offers a highly manoeuvrable alternative to skydiving. It was invented by New Zealander Bob Harris, the Skyboard is a 2.3 m long capsule, in which a pilot lies face down with hands on controls that offer full flying functions. On being launched from between 10,000 ft and 35,000 ft (from either a fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter) Skyboardâ€™s front and rear wings, and tail plane are electronically deployed. The pilot, using aileron and elevator control surfaces can then fly the glider before making a wheels-down or parachute-assisted landing.
