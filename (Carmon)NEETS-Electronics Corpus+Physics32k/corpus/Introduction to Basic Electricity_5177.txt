Maintaining the soldering iron tip is essential for 
proper soldering. Use an anti-seize compound when 
installing the tip to prevent it from becoming frozen. 
Make sure the tip is fully installed in the heating el-
ement. Clean the tip with steel wool before heating 
it, then heat the tip and apply solder as it warms up. 
Applying solder to the tip is called tinning. Rest the 
soldering iron on a stand to remove excess heat from 
non-temperature-controlled soldering irons, as shown 
in Figure 49-13; this is referred to as idling. Wipe the 
tip of the soldering iron across a damp sponge or tip 
cleaner to clean it of any oxidation before soldering.
