Chirp also causes problems with any optical component that has a transmission that is a function of optical
frequency. This can occur if two optical reﬂections conspire to form a weak interferometer or in an erbium-
doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA) that has a frequency-dependent gain [Kuo and Bergmann, 1991]. Once again,
the chirp is converted to IM, which mixes with the signal IM to form second-order distortion.
