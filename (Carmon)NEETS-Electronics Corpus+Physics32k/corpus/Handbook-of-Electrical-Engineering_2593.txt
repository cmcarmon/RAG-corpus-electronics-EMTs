FIGURE 24.44 Drain current ID versus drain voltage VD for various choices of gate bias VG. The dashed-line curves are
for a long-channel device for which the current in saturation increases quadratically with gate bias. The solid-line curves
are for a short-channel device that is approaching velocity saturation and thus exhibits a more linear increase in saturation
current with gate bias, as discussed in the text.
