Figure 2-9 reiterates for you the distorting effect that the armature field has on the flux between the 
pole pieces. Notice, however, that the effect has shifted the neutral plane backward, against the direction 
of rotation. This is different from a dc generator, where the neutral plane shifted forward in the direction 
of rotation.
