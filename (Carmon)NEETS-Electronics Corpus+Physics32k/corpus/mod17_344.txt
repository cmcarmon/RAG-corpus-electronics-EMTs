The thirty-two possible combinations available from the five-unit code are insufficient to handle the 
alphabet and numbers since twenty-six combinations are required for the letters of the English alphabet 
alone. This leaves only six combinations for numerals, symbols, or nonprinting functions. This number of 
combinations is obviously inadequate; therefore, two of the thirty-two combinations are used as shift 
signals. The shift signals are often referred to as case-shift signals (one case is a letter shift, and the other 
a figure shift.) These two shift signals permit the remaining code combination to be used as letter-shift 
signals for letters and as figure-shift signals for numerals, function signs, and so forth. When a letter shift 
is transmitted, it sets the receiving instrument in a condition to recognize any letter signal combination. It 
will recognize letter combinations until a figure shift is received. Then the receiving instrument sets itself 
in a condition to recognize any figure signal combination received. The interpretation of a signal 
combination is determined by the previous shift signal. This plan enables 30 of the 32 available 
combinations to have two meanings.
