Electrical components are often given a power rating. The power rating, in watts, indicates the rate at
which the device converts electrical energy into another form of energy, such as light, heat, or motion. An
example of such a rating is noted when comparing a 150-watt lamp to a 100-watt lamp. The higher
wattage rating of the 150-watt lamp indicates it is capable of converting more electrical energy into light
energy than the lamp of the lower rating. Other common examples of devices with power ratings are
soldering irons and small electric motors.
