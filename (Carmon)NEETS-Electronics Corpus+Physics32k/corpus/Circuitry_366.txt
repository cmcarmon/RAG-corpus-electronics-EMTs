Example 7.6 
 
A BFY50  transistor  is  used  in  a  common-emitter 
amplifier  stage  with  RL = 10  kP and  IC = 1 mA. 
Determine the output voltage produced by an input 
signal of 10 mV. (You may ignore the effect of hre 
and  any  bias  components  that  may  be  present 
externally.) 
 
Solution 
 
The equivalent circuit (with hre replaced by a short 
circuit) is shown in Fig. 7.30. The load effectively 
appears between the collector and emitter while the 
input signal appears between base and emitter. First 
we need to find the value of input current, Ib, from:
