The multiplication factor, k, is defined as (see Nuclear chain reaction):




k
=



number of neutrons in one generation


number of neutrons in preceding generation





{\displaystyle k={\frac {\mbox{number of neutrons in one generation}}{\mbox{number of neutrons in preceding generation}}}}

If k is greater than 1, the chain reaction is supercritical, and the neutron population will grow exponentially.
If k is less than 1, the chain reaction is subcritical, and the neutron population will exponentially decay.
If k = 1, the chain reaction is critical and the neutron population will remain constant.
