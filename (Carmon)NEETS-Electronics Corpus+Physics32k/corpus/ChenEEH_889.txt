Clock Scheduling for Maximum Performance
The linear programming (LP) problem of computing a feasible
clock skew schedule while minimizing the clock period TCP of
a circuit can be found in (Friedman, 1995; Neves and Fried-
man 1996a, 1996b; Afghani and Svensson, 1990; Kourtev,
1999; Fishburn, 1990). With TCP as the value of the objective
function being minimized, this problem is formally deÔ¨Åned as
problem LCSS:
