An approach slope is the path that an airplane follows on its final approach to land on a runway. It takes its name from the fact that this path is ideally a gentle downward slope. A commonly used approach slope is 3° from the horizontal. However, certain airports have steeper approach paths based on topography, buildings, or other considerations. E.g., London City Airport has a 5.5° approach, and only aircraft that can maintain such an approach are permitted to use the airport.
The term glide slope is often applied to mean approach slope although to be correct, glide slope applies to the vertical guidance element of the Instrument Landing System.
