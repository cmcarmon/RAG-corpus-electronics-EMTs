PARAMETRIC FREQUENCY CONVERTERS.â€”Parametric frequency converters, using 
varactors, are of three basic types. The UPPER-SIDEBAND PARAMETRIC UP-CONVERTER 
produces an output frequency that is the SUM of the input frequency and the pump frequency. The 
LOWER-SIDEBAND PARAMETRIC DOWN-CONVERTER produces an output frequency that is the 
DIFFERENCE between the pump frequency and the input frequency. The DOUBLE-SIDEBAND 
PARAMETRIC UP-CONVERTER produces an output in which both the SUM and the DIFFERENCE of 
the pump and input frequencies are available.
