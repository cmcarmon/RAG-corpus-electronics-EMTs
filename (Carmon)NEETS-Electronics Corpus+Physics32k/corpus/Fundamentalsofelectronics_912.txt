This corresponds to our decoding table: We associate the parity check matrix multiplication result with
the error pattern and add this to the received word. If more than one error occurs (unlikely though it may
be), this “error correction” strategy usually makes the error worse in the sense that more bits are changed
from what was transmitted.
