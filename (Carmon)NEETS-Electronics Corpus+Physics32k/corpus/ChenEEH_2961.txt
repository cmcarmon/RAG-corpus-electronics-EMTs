Bipolar Junction Transistor
Typically made from silicon in the NPN conﬁguration, the
microwave bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is historically
the dominant device below 4 GHz but does ﬁnd some applica-
tion above this frequency. Currently, silicon CMOS devices are
increasingly competitive at these frequencies for many appli-
cations.
