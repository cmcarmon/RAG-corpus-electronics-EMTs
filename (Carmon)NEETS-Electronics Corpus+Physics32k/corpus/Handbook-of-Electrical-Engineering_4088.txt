Federal  Communications  Commission. The  FCC  sets  limits  on  the  amount  of  electromagnetic  radiation
allowed to be emitted from commercial electronic equipment. Any electronic device capable of emitting radio
frequency energy by radiation or conduction is deÔ¨Åned by the Commission as a radio frequency device and is
subject  to  comply  with  the  standards.  The  relevant  limits  and  some  general  measurement  techniques,  along
with equipment authorization procedures, are given in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 47 (Tele-
communications).
