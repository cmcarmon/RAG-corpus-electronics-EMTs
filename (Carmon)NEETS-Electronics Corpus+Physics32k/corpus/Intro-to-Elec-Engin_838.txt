The majority of three-phase systems are four-wire, wye-connected systems, in which a
grounded neutral conductor is used. Some three-phase systems such as delta-connected and three-
wire wye-connected systems do not have a neutral conductor. Because the neutral current is nearly
zero under normal operating conditions, neutral conductors for transmission lines are typically
smaller in size and current-carrying capacity than the phase conductors. Thus, the cost of a
neutral conductor is substantially less than that of a phase conductor. The capital and operating
costs of three-phase transmission and distribution systems, with or without neutral conductors,
are comparatively much less than those of separate single-phase systems.
