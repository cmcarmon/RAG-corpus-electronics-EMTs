. Media description: This enables a distributed multi-
media application to distribute session information,
such as media type (audio, video, or data) used in the
session, media encoding schemes (PCM, MPEG-II),
session start time, session stop time, and IP addresses of
the involved hosts, for example. It is often essential to
describe the session before establishment because most
participants involved in the session will have different
multimedia capabilities.
