as a reference with a phase angle of zero for convenience. This procedure yields the equivalent
single-phase circuit in which all quantities correspond to those of one phase in the three-phase
circuit. Except for the 120Â° phase displacements in the currents and voltages, the conditions in
the other two phases are the same, and there is no need to investigate them individually. Line
currents in the three-phase system are the same as in the single-phase circuit, and total three-phase
real power, reactive power, and volt-amperes are three times the corresponding quantities in the
single-phase circuit. Line-to-line voltages, in magnitude, can be obtained by multiplying voltages
in the single-phase circuit by
