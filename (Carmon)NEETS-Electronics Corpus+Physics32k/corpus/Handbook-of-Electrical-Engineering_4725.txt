Some typical values of the characteristic impedance of acoustic media are given in Table 48.1. The characteristic
impedance corresponding to a mode is given by the product of the density and the phase velocity, rV, even in
the anisotropic case where the effective stiffness c in Eq. (48.10) is difÔ¨Åcult to determine.
