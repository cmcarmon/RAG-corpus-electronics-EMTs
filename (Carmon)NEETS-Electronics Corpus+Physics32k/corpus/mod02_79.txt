 The second factor is the coil diameter. In figure 2-6 you can see that the coil in view B has twice the 
diameter of coil view A. Physically, it requires more wire to construct a coil of large diameter than one of 
small diameter with an equal number of turns. Therefore, more lines of force exist to induce a counter emf
