With the bipolar method illustrated in Fig. 113.19(A),
abnormal  activity  located  under  electrode  X  will  be
revealed  as  a  phase  reversal  in  adjacent  channels.  With
monopolar  recording  using  the  earlobe  reference  elec-
trode [Fig. 113.19(B)] the abnormal activity under elec-
trode X will be largest in the channel connected to that
electrode and smaller in the adjacent channels.
