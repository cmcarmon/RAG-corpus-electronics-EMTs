The basic element of logic circuits is the transistor switch, a simpliﬁed model of which is shown
in Figure 9.1.1. The control signal is the input voltage vin, which must lie in either the “low” range
or the “high” range for a digital circuit. When vin is low, the switch may take either the open or
the closed position; when vin is high, the switch takes the other position. Looking at Figure 9.1.1,
closing the switch makes vout zero, while opening the switch yields an output near VCC, assuming
that not much current ﬂows through the output terminal. If VCC is chosen to lie in the high range
and V = 0 is inside the low range, then allowed values of vin control the switch and give rise to
allowed values of vout. A common special circuit in which a high input yields a low output, and
vice versa, is known as an inverter, which performs the complement operation.
