As you can see, I have used the .plot command in the netlist instead of the more familiar
.print command. This generates a pseudo-graphic plot of ﬁgures on the computer screen us-
ing text characters. SPICE plots graphs in such a way that time is on the vertical axis (going
down) and amplitude (voltage/current) is plotted on the horizontal (right=more; left=less). No-
tice how the voltage increases (to the right of the plot) very quickly at ﬁrst, then tapering off
as time goes on. Current also changes very quickly at ﬁrst then levels off as time goes on, but
it is approaching minimum (left of scale) while voltage approaches maximum.
