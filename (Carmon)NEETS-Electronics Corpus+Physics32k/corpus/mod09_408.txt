As before, assume that transistor Q1 is saturated and transistor Q2 is cut off. Two methods are 
available to cause the flip-flop to change states. First, a positive-going pulse can be applied to input 1 to 
cause Q1 to change from saturation to cutoff. Second, the same result can be achieved by applying a 
negative-going pulse to input 2. Transistor Q2 would then change from Cutoff to saturation. Normally, a 
pulse is applied to the saturated transistor causing it to cut off. An input pulse which is of the correct 
polarity to change the state of the flip-flop is, as before, called a trigger pulse.
