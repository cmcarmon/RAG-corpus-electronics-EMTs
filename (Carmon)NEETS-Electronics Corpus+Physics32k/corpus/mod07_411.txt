As you may recall from your past studies in electricity, every circuit has advantages and 
disadvantages. The full-wave rectifier is no exception. In studying the full-wave rectifier, you may have 
found that by doubling the output frequency, the average voltage has doubled, and the resulting signal is 
much easier to filter because of the high ripple frequency. The only disadvantage is that the peak voltage 
in the full-wave rectifier is only half the peak voltage in the half-wave rectifier. This is because the 
secondary of the power transformer in the full-wave rectifier is center tapped; therefore, only half the 
source voltage goes to each diode.
