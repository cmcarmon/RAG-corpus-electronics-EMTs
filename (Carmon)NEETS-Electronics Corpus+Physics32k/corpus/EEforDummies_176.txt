A give‐and‐take relationship is going on in this circuit: Voltage is the push the 
battery gives to get current moving, and energy from that push is absorbed 
when current moves through the resistor and the LED. As current flows 
through the resistor and the LED, voltage drops across each of those com-
ponents. The resistor and the LED are using up energy supplied by the force 
(voltage) that pushes the current through them.
