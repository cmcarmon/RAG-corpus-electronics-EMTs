In LCP theory a lone pair is treated as a ligand. Gillespie terms the lone pair a lone pair domain and states that these lone pair domains push the ligands together until they reach the interligand distance predicted by the relevant inter-ligand radii. An example demonstrating this is shown below, where the F-F distance is the same in the AF3 and AF4+ species :
