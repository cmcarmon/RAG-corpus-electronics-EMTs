Hearing aids pose a tremendous challenge for the
DSP engineer, as well as for the audiologist and acous-
tician. Due to the continuing progress in chip tech-
nology,  the  physical  size  of  a  digital  aid  should  no
longer be a serious problem in the near future; how-
ever, power consumption will still be a problem for
quite  some  time.  Besides  the  obvious  necessity  of
avoiding  howling  (acoustic  feedback),  for  example,
by  employing  sophisticated  models  of  the  electroa-
coustic  transducers,  acoustic  leaks,  and  ear  canal  to
control  the  aid  accordingly,  there  is  a  much  more
fundamental  problem:  since  DSP  allows  complex
schemes of splitting, ﬁltering, compressing, and (re-
)  combining  the  signal,  hearing  aid  performance  is
no longer limited by bottlenecks in technology. It is
still limited, however, by the lack of basic knowledge
about  how  to  map  an  arbitrary  input  signal  (i.e.,
speech  from  a  desired  speaker)  onto  the  reduced
capabilities  of  the  auditory  system  of  the  targeted
selection  and  ﬁtting  of
wearer  of  the  aid.  Hence,  the 
 becomes the most important issue.
