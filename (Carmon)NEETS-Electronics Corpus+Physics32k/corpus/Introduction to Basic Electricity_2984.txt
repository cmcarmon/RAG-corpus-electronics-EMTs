If voltage is applied to N-type material  (FigureÂ 28-7),  
the free electrons contributed by the donor atoms flow 
toward the positive terminal. Additional electrons 
break away from their covalent bonds and flow toward 
the positive terminal. These free electrons, in break-
ing their covalent bonds, create electron-hole pairs. 
The corresponding holes move toward the negative 
terminal.
