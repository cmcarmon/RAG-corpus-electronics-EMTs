Combining a reflector and a director with the driven element causes a decrease in back radiation and 
an increase in directivity. This combination results in the two main advantages of a parasitic arrayâ€”
unidirectivity and increased gain. If the parasitic array is rotated, it can pick up or transmit in different 
directions because of the reduction of transmitted energy in all but the desired direction. An antenna of 
this type is called a ROTARY ARRAY. Size for size, both the gain and directivity of parasitic arrays are 
greater than those of driven arrays. The disadvantage of parasitic arrays is that their adjustment is critical 
and they do not operate over a wide frequency range.
