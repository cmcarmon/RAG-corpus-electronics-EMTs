With varying but positive base current, as seen from Figure 7.3.4(a), vBE stays nearly constant at
the junction threshold voltage Vγ , which is about 0.7 V for a typical silicon BJT.
The Early effect and the Early voltage −VA (whose magnitude is on the order of 50 to
100 V) for a typical npn BJT are illustrated in Figure 7.3.5, in which the linear curves are
extrapolated back to the vCE-axis to meet at a point −VA. The Early effect causes the nonzero
slope and is due to the fact that increasing vBE makes the width of the depletion region of the
CBJ larger, thereby reducing the effective width of the base. ISE in Equation (7.3.1) is inversely
proportional to the base width; so iC increases according to Equation (7.3.2). The increase in iC
can be accounted for by adding a factor to ISE and modifying Equation (7.3.2) such that αiE is
replaced by αiE(1 + vCE/VA).
