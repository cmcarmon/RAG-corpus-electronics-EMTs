indicators  connected  to  output  port  address  82H. 
The  LEDs  are 
their  
corresponding  input  switches  on  the  following 
basis: 
 
Inputs (Port 80H) 
 
Switch ‘on’ = logic 1 
Switch ‘off’ = logic 0 
 
Outputs (Port 82H) 
 
Logic 1 = LED ‘off’ 
Logic 0 = LED ‘on’ 
 
Note that, in order to illuminate an LED the logic 1 
input must be inverted in order to produce a logic 0 
output. Hence it will be necessary to read the byte 
from port 80H, invert (i.e. complement) it, and then 
output it to port 82H. 
  The program is to continue to run, detecting the 
state  of 
the 
appropriate LEDs on,  until such time as all of the 
input  switches  are  set  to  the  ‘off’  position.  If  this 
situation is detected the program is to halt.
