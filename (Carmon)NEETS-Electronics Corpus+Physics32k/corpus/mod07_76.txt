In addition to being numbered, the shells are also given letter designations starting with the shell
closest to the nucleus and progressing outward as shown in figure 1-3. The shells are considered to be
full, or complete, when they contain the following quantities of electrons: 2 in the K(1st) shell, 8 in the
L(2nd) shell, 18 in the M(3rd) shell, and so on, in accordance with the exclusion principle. Each of these
shells is a major shell and can be divided into subshells, of which there are four, labeled s, p, d, and f.
Like the major shells, the subshells are also limited as to the number of electrons they contain. Thus, the
"s" subshell is complete when it contains 2 electrons, the "p" subshell when it contains 6, the "d" subshell
when it contains 10, and the "f" subshell when it contains 14 electrons.
