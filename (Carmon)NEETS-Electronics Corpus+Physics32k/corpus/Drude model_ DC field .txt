The simplest analysis of the Drude model assumes that electric field E is both uniform and constant, and that the thermal velocity of electrons is sufficiently high such that they accumulate only an infinitesimal amount of momentum dp between collisions, which occur on average every τ seconds.
Then an electron isolated at time t will on average have been traveling for time τ since its last collision, and consequently will have accumulated momentum

{\displaystyle \Delta \langle \mathbf {p} \rangle =q\mathbf {E} \tau .}

During its last collision, this electron will have been just as likely to have bounced forward as backward, so all prior contributions to the electron's momentum may be ignored, resulting in the expression

{\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {p} \rangle =q\mathbf {E} \tau .}

Substituting the relations

{\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {p} \rangle =m\langle \mathbf {v} \rangle ,}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =nq\langle \mathbf {v} \rangle ,}
