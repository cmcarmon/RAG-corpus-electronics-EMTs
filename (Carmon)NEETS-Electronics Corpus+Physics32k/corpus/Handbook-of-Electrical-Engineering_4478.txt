The FEM provides a systematic technique for replacing the continuum ﬁeld equations with a set of discrete
algebraic equations that can be solved by standard procedures. In Fig. 44.2 a typical ﬁeld map is shown for a
permanent  magnet  machine  modeled  by  a  computer  simulator  that  can  take  into  account  nonlinearity  and
permanently magnetized materials. Although hysteresis effects can be included, the computational resources
required  can  be  prohibitive  because  of  the  vector  nature  of  magnetization.  The  magnetic  material  must  be
characterized  by  a  large  number  of  measurements  to  take  account  of  the  minor  loops,  and  from  these  the
convolution  integrals  necessary  to  obtain  the  constitutive  relationships  can  be  evaluated  [Mayergoyz,  1990].
These characteristics must then be followed through time; this can be implemented by solving at a discrete set
of time points, given the initial conditions in the material.
