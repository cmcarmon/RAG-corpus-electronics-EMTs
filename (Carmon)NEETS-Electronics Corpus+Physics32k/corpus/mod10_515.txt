The right-hand column in figure 3-27 shows the current waveshapes on the open-ended line. Since
the current is reflected out of phase at an open end, the resultant waveshapes differ from those for voltage.
The two out-of-phase components always cancel at the end of the transmission line, so the resultant is
always zero at that point. If you check all the resultant waveshapes shown in the right-hand column of
