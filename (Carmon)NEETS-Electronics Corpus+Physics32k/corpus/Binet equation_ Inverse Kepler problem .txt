Consider the inverse Kepler problem. What kind of force law produces a noncircular elliptical orbit (or more generally a noncircular conic section) around a focus of the ellipse?
Differentiating twice the above polar equation for an ellipse gives

{\displaystyle l\,{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}u}{\mathrm {d} \theta ^{2}}}=-\varepsilon \cos \theta .}

The force law is therefore

{\displaystyle F=-mh^{2}u^{2}\left({\frac {-\varepsilon \cos \theta }{l}}+{\frac {1+\varepsilon \cos \theta }{l}}\right)=-{\frac {mh^{2}u^{2}}{l}}=-{\frac {mh^{2}}{lr^{2}}},}

which is the anticipated inverse square law. Matching the orbital

where the second term is an inverse-quartic force corresponding to quadrupole effects such as the angular shift of periapsis (It can be also obtained via retarded potentials).
In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism we will obtain
