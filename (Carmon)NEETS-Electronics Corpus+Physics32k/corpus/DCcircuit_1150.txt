sounds: a single, solid strand of copper the whole length of the wire. Stranded wire is composed
of smaller strands of solid copper wire twisted together to form a single, larger conductor. The
greatest beneﬁt of stranded wire is its mechanical ﬂexibility, being able to withstand repeated
bending and twisting much better than solid copper (which tends to fatigue and break after
time).
