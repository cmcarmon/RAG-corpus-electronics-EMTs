power curve  A curve that results from taking the 
product of the sine curve for current and the sine 
curve for voltage. For resistive circuits, the power 
curve is a positive area because the load absorbs 
the power as heat. For purely reactive circuits the 
power curve has both positive and negative areas 
because the load absorbs no net power.
