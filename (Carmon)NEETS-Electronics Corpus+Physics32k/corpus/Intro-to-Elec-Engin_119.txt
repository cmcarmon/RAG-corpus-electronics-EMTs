By far the most common is the Wheatstone bridge designed for precise measurement of
resistance. Figure 1.4.2 shows the basic circuit in which the measurement of an unknown resistance
Rx is performed by balancing the variable resistances Ra and Rb until no current ï¬‚ows through
meter A. Under this null condition,
