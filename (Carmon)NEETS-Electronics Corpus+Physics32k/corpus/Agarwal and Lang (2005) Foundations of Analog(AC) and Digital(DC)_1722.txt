where vC is the capacitor voltage defined positively at the upper node, iL is the inductor current
defined positively in the downwards direction, and G, C and L are the conductance, capacitance
and inductance of the resistor, capacitor and inductor respectively. A comparison of the two sets of
equations shows that the second set can be constructed from the first with iL replaced by vC, âˆ’vC
replaced by iL, R replaced by G, L replaced by C and C replaced by L. Therefore, the homogeneous
response of the circuit shown in Figure 12.14a can be constructed directly from Equations 12.58
and 12.59 in the same way. See, for example, Equations 12.100 and 12.101. Indeed, all results in
Section 12.4 can be derived from those in Section 12.2 in the same way. Further, duality continues
to hold when the circuit shown in Figure 12.14a is extended to include a parallel current source
while the circuit shown in Figure 12.14b is extended to include a series voltage source. Thus, all
results in Section 12.6 can be derived directly from the results in Section 12.5.
5. Interestingly, as we will see in Section 12.4, the dynamics of the parallel RLC circuit will be
essentially identical to that of the series circuit for all three cases, except for a reversal in the role of
R. The identical dynamics for the two circuits arises because they both have the same characteristic
equation when it is represented in the standard form shown in Equation 12.43.
