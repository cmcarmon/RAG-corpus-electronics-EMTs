to a final volume



V


{\displaystyle V}
and pressure



P


{\displaystyle P}
at any constant temperature, the change in entropy is given by:

{\displaystyle \Delta S=nR\ln {\frac {V}{V_{0}}}=-nR\ln {\frac {P}{P_{0}}}.}

Here



n


{\displaystyle n}
is the number of moles of gas and



R


{\displaystyle R}
is the ideal gas constant. These equations also apply for expansion into a finite vacuum or a throttling process, where the temperature, internal energy and enthalpy for an ideal gas remain constant.
