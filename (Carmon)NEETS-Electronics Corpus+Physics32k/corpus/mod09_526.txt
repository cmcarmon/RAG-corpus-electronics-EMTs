In view (A) of figure 4-6, the SERIES-NEGATIVE LIMITER limits the negative portion of the 
waveform, as shown in view (B). Let's consider the input signal and determine how the output is 
produced. During T0 to T1 (view (B)), the anode is more positive than the cathode and the diode 
conducts. Current flows up through the resistor and the diode, and a positive voltage is developed at the 
output. The voltage across the resistor is essentially the same as the voltage applied to the circuit.
