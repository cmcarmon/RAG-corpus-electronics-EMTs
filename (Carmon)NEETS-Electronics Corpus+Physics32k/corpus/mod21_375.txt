Frequency-measuring equipment and devices, particularly those used to determine radio frequencies, 
constitute a distinct class of test equipment, because of the important and critical nature of such 
measurements. The requirement of precise calibration is extremely important in all frequency-measuring 
work. To provide accurate measurements, every type of frequency-measuring device must be calibrated 
against some frequency standard.
