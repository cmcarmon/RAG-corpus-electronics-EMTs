High-Level Languages Support
Early  research  was  done  also  in  the  area  of  support  for  high-level  languages.  Support  can  be  in  the  form  of
microprogrammed implementations of some language primitive (for example, the trigonometric functions) or
support  for  the  deÔ¨Ånition  and  processing  of  data  structures  (for  example,  trees  and  lists  primitives).  Many
interesting  research  projects  have  led  to  esoteric  laboratory  machines.  More  common  examples  include  the
translate instructions, string searches and compares, or indexing multidimensional arrays.
Paging, Virtual Memory
An early and typical application of microprogramming is the implementation of the paging algorithm for a
virtual memory system. It is a typical application since it is a low-level function that must be time optimized
and is highly hardware dependent. Furthermore, the various maintenance functions which are required by the
