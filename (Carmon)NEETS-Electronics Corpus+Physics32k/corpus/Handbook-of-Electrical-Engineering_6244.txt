Blanking of  the  scanning  beam  during  the  return  trace  is  provided  for  in  the  video  signal  by  a “blacker-
than-black” pulse waveform. In addition, in most receivers and monitors another blanking pulse is generated
from the horizontal and vertical scanning circuits and applied to the display system to ensure a black screen
during scanning retrace. The retrace lines are shown as diagonal dashed lines in Fig. 69.16.
