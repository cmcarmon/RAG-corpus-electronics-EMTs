Using the vector definition, mass flux is also equal to:







j




m



=
ρ

u



{\displaystyle {\mathbf {j} }_{\rm {m}}=\rho \mathbf {u} }

where:
ρ = mass density,
u = velocity field of mass elements flowing (i.e. at each point in space the velocity of an element of matter is some velocity vector u).
Sometimes this equation may be used to define jm as a vector.
