The viscosity of gases is the result in the transfer of each molecule of gas as they pass each other from layer to layer. As gases tend to pass one another, the velocity, in the form of momentum, of the faster moving molecule speeds up the slower moving molecule. As the slower moving molecule passes the faster moving molecule, the momentum of the slower moving particle slows down the faster moving particle. The molecules continue to enact until frictional drag causes both molecules to equalize their velocities.
