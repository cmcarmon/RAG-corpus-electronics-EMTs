Matter is defined as anything that occupies space and has weight; that is, the weight and dimensions
of matter can be measured. Examples of matter are air, water, automobiles, clothing, and even our own
bodies. Thus, we can say that matter may be found in any one of three states: SOLID, LIQUID, and
GASEOUS.
