We could apply the Branch Current method to this circuit, but it would require six currents
(I1 through I6), leading to a very large set of simultaneous equations to solve. Using the Mesh
Current method, though, we may solve for all currents and voltages with much fewer variables.
The Ô¨Årst step in the Mesh Current method is to draw just enough mesh currents to account
for all components in the circuit. Looking at our bridge circuit, it should be obvious where to
