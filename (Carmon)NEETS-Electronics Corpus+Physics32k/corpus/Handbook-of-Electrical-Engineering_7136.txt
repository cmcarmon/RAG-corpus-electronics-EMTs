The  system  noise  temperature  is  deﬁned  at  a  speciﬁc  reference  point  such  as  the  antenna  aperture  or  the
receiver input. However, G/T is independent of the reference point when G correctly accounts for circuit losses.
The satellite’s noise temperature is generally higher than an earth terminal’s under clear sky conditions because
the satellite antenna sees a warm earth temperature of »150–300 K, depending on the proportion of clouds,
oceans, and land in the satellite antenna’s beam, whereas a directive earth antenna generally sees cold sky and
the sidelobes generally receive only a small fraction of noise power from the warm earth. Furthermore, a satellite
receiving system generally has a higher noise temperature due to circuit losses in the beam forming networks,
protection circuitry, and extra components for redundancy.
