A controlled source may be controlled by more than one circuit variable, but we will discuss those having
a single controlling variable since multiple controlling variables require no new ideas. Similarly, we will deal
only with resistive elements, since inductors and capacitors introduce no new concepts. The controlled voltage
or current source may depend on the controlling variable in a linear or nonlinear manner. When the relationship
is nonlinear, however, the equations are frequently linearized to examine the effects of small variations about
some dc values. When we linearize, we will use the customary notation of small letters to represent general and
time-variable  voltages  and  currents  and  large  letters  to  represent  constants  such  as  the  dc  value  or  the  peak
value of a sinusoid. On subscripts, large letters represent the total voltage or current and small letters represent
the small-signal component. Thus, the equation iB = IB + Ib cos wt means that the total base current is the sum
of a constant and a small-signal component, which is sinusoidal with an amplitude of Ib .
