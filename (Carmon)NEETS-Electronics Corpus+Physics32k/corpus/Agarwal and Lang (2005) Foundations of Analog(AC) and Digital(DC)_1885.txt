This is the forced response for a cosine wave drive.
If the excitation is a
tone burst, then the homogeneous solution must be added to obtain the com-
plete solution. By comparing Equation 13.50 to Equation 13.48, we conclude
that the complex amplitude Vo in Equation 13.48 is a complex number con-
taining information about both the amplitude and the phase of the sinusoidal
output waveform vo(t) at any frequency.
