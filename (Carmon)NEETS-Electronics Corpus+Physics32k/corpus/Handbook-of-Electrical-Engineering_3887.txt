For  an  antenna  with  cross  range  dimension  D  and  a  scattering  element  at  range  R,  the  largest  synthetic
aperture that can be formed is of dimension lR/D (the width of the footprint). Because this data collection
scenario is for round trip propagation, the phase shift at each collecting location is twice the shift at the edges
of a single physical antenna. Therefore at a range R, the synthetic aperture resolution is
