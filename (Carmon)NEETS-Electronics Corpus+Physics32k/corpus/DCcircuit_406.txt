For the morbidly curious, Charles Dalziel’s experimentation conducted at the University
of California (Berkeley) began with a state grant to investigate the bodily effects of sub-lethal
electric current. His testing method was as follows: healthy male and female volunteer subjects
were asked to hold a copper wire in one hand and place their other hand on a round, brass
plate. A voltage was then applied between the wire and the plate, causing electrons to ﬂow
through the subject’s arms and chest. The current was stopped, then resumed at a higher
level. The goal here was to see how much current the subject could tolerate and still keep their
hand pressed against the brass plate. When this threshold was reached, laboratory assistants
forcefully held the subject’s hand in contact with the plate and the current was again increased.
The subject was asked to release the wire they were holding, to see at what current level
involuntary muscle contraction (tetanus) prevented them from doing so. For each subject the
experiment was conducted using DC and also AC at various frequencies. Over two dozen
human volunteers were tested, and later studies on heart ﬁbrillation were conducted using
animal subjects.
