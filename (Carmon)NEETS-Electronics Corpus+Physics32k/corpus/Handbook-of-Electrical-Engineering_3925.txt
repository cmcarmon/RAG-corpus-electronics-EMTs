Microstrip antenna elements have a number of useful and inter-
esting  features,  but  probably  the  most  serious  limitation  of  this
technology  is  the  narrow  bandwidth  of  the  basic  element.  While
antenna elements such as dipoles, slots, and waveguide horns have
operating  bandwidths  ranging  from  15  to  50%,  the  traditional
microstrip patch element typically has an impedance bandwidth of
only a few percent. Fig. 38.18 shows the impedance bandwidth vs.
substrate thickness for a rectangular microstrip antenna with sub-
strate  permittivities  of  2.2  and  10.2.  Observe  from  the  ﬁgure  that
bandwidth  decreases  as  the  substrate  becomes  thinner  and  as  the
dielectric constant increases. Both of these trends are explained as
a result of the increased Q of the resonator, basically due to the fact
that the patch current is in close proximity to its negative image in
the substrate ground plane. In terms of bandwidth, it is preferable
to use a thick antenna substrate, with a low dielectric constant. But
because of inductive loading and possible spurious radiation from
coplanar microstrip circuitry, the thickness of a microstrip antenna substrate is typically limited to 0.02l or
less. This illustrates the essential compromise associated with the microstrip antenna concept, as it is not possible
to obtain optimum performance from both a microstrip antenna and microstrip circuitry on a single dielectric
substrate. These two functions are distinct electromagnetically, since the bound ﬁelds associated with nonra-
diating circuitry obviate efﬁcient radiation.
