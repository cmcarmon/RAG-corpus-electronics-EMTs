Bellows and Hutchings (1998) have developed a manage-
ment technique similar to the method that object-oriented
languages use to manage memory. Their management tech-
nique is part of their design tool called JHDL. A circuit con-
Ô¨Åguration is treated as a distinct object and is downloaded into
the FPGA when the constructor of the object is invoked.
