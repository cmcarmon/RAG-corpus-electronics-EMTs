Packet Classiﬁcation
Every packet, regardless of whether it is a real-time packet or a
non real-time packet, is treated equally at all routers in the
best-effort Internet. However, real-time multimedia trafﬁc
demands differential treatment in the network. Thus the
newer service models will have to use some mechanism to
distinguish between real-time and non real-time packets. In
practice, this is usually done by packet marking. The type of
service (ToS) ﬁeld in the IP header can be used for this
purpose. Some newer Internet architectures like MPLS make
use of short labels that are attached to the front of the IP
packets for this purpose.
