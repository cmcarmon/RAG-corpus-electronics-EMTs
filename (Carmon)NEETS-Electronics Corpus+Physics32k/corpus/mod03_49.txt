This chapter will acquaint you with the basics of circuit measurement and some of the devices used
to measure voltage, current, resistance, power, and frequency. There are other quantities involved in
electrical circuits, such as capacitance, inductance, impedance, true power, and effective power. It is
possible to measure any circuit quantity once you are able to select and use the proper circuit measuring
device. You will NOT know all there is to know about circuit measuring devices (test equipment) when
you finish this chapter. That is beyond the scope of this chapter and even beyond the scope of this training
series. However, more information on test equipment is provided in another portion of this training series.
