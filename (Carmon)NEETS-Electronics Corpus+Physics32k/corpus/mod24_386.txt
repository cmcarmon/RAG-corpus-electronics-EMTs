Mechanical splicing may involve the use of a glass or ceramic alignment tube, or capillary. The inner
diameter of this glass or ceramic tube is only slightly larger than the outer diameter of the fiber. A
transparent adhesive, injected into the tube, bonds the two fibers together. The adhesive also provides
index matching between the optical fibers. Figure 4-9 illustrates fiber alignment using a glass or ceramic
tube. This splicing technique relies on the inner diameter of the alignment tube. If the inner diameter is
too large, splice loss will increase because of fiber misalignment. If the inner diameter is too small, it is
impossible to insert the fiber into the tube.
