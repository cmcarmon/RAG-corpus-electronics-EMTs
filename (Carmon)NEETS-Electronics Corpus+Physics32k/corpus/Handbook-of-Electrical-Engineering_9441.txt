The recovery block approach to software fault tolerance is analogous to the active approaches to hardware
versions  of  a  program  are  provided,  and  a
fault  tolerance,  speciﬁcally  the  cold  standby  sparing  approach. 
single set of acceptance tests is used. One version of the program is designated as the primary version, and the
1 versions are designated as spares, or secondary versions. The primary version of the software
remaining 
is always used unless it fails to pass the acceptance tests. If the acceptance tests are failed by the primary version,
then the ﬁrst secondary version is tried. This process continues until one version passes the acceptance tests or
the system fails because none of the versions can pass the tests.
