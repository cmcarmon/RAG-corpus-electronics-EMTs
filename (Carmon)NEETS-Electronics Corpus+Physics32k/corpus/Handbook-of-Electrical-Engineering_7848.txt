Differential Detection
Figure 80.33 shows the differential detection system that is the basis of magneto-optical readout in practically
all erasable optical storage systems in use today. The beam splitter (BS) diverts half of the reï¬‚ected beam away
from  the  laser  and  into  the  detection  module.1  The  polarizing  beam  splitter  (PBS)  splits  the  beam  into  two
parts,  each  carrying  the  projection  of  the  incident  polarization  along  one  axis  of  the  PBS,  as  shown  in
Fig. 80.33(b). The component of polarization along one of the axes goes straight through, while the component
