The information collected by TEDES is converted to an administrative penalty decision. A traffic ticket constituting a fine assessed against the owner of the vehicle is sent per mail to the owner's address accompanied by an image of the vehicle taken during the violation, which shows the vehicle registration plate. The fine for speeding is categorized in two as exceeding the speed limit between 10% and 30%, and more than 30%. Forced red light violation in order to enable emergency vehicles with right-of-way, such as ambulances, fire engines and police cars, pass through is not charged. According to a court order, traffic law violations of a vehicle assessed by TEDES within five minutes can be charged once only.
Arrival of the ticket per mail can take five to fifteen days. The existence of a ticket can be questioned online at the government's website by giving details of the related traffic registration certificate. The fine can be paid online at the website of the government's revenue administration.
