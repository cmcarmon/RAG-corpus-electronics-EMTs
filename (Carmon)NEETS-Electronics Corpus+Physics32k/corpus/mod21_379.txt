To ensure reliable coverage of the United States and extensive coverage of other parts of the world, 
radio stations WWV and WWVH provide the primary standard radio frequencies listed in table 3-1. The 
transmission of WWV and WWVH are interrupted for 5 minutes of each hour. The silent period begins at 
15 minutes past the hour for station WWVH and 45 minutes past the hour for station WWV. These silent 
periods are provided to eliminate errors caused by interference.
