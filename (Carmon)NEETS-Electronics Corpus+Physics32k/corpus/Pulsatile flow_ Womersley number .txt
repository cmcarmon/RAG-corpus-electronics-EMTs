For

, viscous forces dominate the flow, and the pulse is considered quasi-static with a parabolic profile. For



α
≳

{\displaystyle \alpha \gtrsim 2}
, the inertial forces are dominant in the central core, whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer. Thus, the velocity profile gets flattened, and phase between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core.
