Lattice QCD is a way to solve the theory exactly from first principles, without any assumptions, to the desired precision. However, in practice the calculation power is limited, which requires a smart use of the available resources. One needs to choose an action which gives the best physical description of the system, with minimum errors, using the available computational power. The limited computer resources force one to use physical constants which are different from their true physical values:
The lattice discretization means a finite lattice spacing and size, which do not exist in the continuous and infinite space-time. In addition to the automatic error introduced by this, the limited resources force the use of smaller physical lattices and larger lattice spacing than wanted in order to minimize errors.
Another unphysical quantity is the quark masses. Quark masses are steadily going down, and within the past few years a few collaborations have used nearly physical values to extrapolate down to physical values.
In order to compensate for the errors one improves the lattice action in various ways, to minimize mainly finite spacing errors.
