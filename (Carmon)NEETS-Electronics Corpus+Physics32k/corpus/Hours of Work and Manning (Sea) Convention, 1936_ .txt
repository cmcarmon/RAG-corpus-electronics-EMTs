The convention was revised by the Convention concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning of 1946 as well as its 1949 and 1958 revision, none of which entered into force. The entry into force of the 1996 Convention concerning Seafarers' Hours of Work and the Manning of Ships (which also revised the convention) in 2002 signified the end of the opening for signature of the convention.
