Compressed Digital Video
The  next  generation  of  video  formats  will  be  the  product  of  compressed  digital  video  (CDV)  technology
[Netravali  and  Haskel,  1988].  For  years  digital “NTSC-like”  video  required  a  bit  rate  of  approximately  100
Mbps. CDV technology can reduce the required bit rate to less than 5 Mbps. This compression requires complex
digital  signal  processing  and  large-scale  circuit  integration,  but  advances  in  chip  and  microprocessor  design
have made inexpensive implementation of the compression algorithms feasible.
