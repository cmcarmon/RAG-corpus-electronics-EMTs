In physics, and in particular in optics, the term group delay has the following meanings:
1. The rate of change of the total phase shift with respect to angular frequency,





τ

d
ϕ


d
ω





{\displaystyle \tau _{g}=-{\frac {d\phi }{d\omega }}}


through a device or transmission medium, where



ϕ



{\displaystyle \phi \ }
is the total phase shift in radians, and



ω



{\displaystyle \omega \ }
is the angular frequency in radians per unit time, equal to



2
π
f



{\displaystyle 2\pi f\ }
, where



f



{\displaystyle f\ }
is the frequency (hertz if group delay is measured in seconds).
2. In an optical fiber, the transit time required for optical power, traveling at a given mode's group velocity, to travel a given distance.
Note: For optical fiber dispersion measurement purposes, the quantity of interest is group delay per unit length, which is the reciprocal of the group velocity of a particular mode. The measured group delay of a signal through an optical fiber exhibits a wavelength dependence due to the various dispersion mechanisms present in the fiber.
It is often desirable for the group delay to be constant across all frequencies; otherwise there is temporal smearing of the signal. Because group delay is

, as defined in (1), it therefore follows that a constant group delay can be achieved if the transfer function of the device or medium has a linear phase response (i.e.,

where the group delay
