â€¢ DO always ship hard disks in their proper shipping containers. If you don't have the original 
shipping container, make sure the shipping box is sturdy and big enough to allow 2" of packing 
material around the disk. Save the original packing material for the hard disk just in case you 
need to ship it somewhere.
