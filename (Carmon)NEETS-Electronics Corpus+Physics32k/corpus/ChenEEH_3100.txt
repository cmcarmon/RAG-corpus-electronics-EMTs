The energy input from the circuit cannot completely be
explained by losses and a change in stored energy. There is a
2 i2(qL(x)=qx)dx. This is the energy turned into me-

chanical work. This term is the one associated with motion.
As a general rule, a situation must occur in which there is a
change of inductance (self and/or mutual) with position.
