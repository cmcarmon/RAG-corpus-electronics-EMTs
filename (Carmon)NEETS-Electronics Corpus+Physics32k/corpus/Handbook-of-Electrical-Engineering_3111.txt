A triac is functionally a pair of converter-grade thyristors connected in antiparallel. The triac symbol and

volt-ampere characteristics are shown in Fig. 30.2. Because of the integration, the triac has poor reapplied 
poor  gate  current  sensitivity  at  turn-on,  and  longer  turn-off  time.  Triacs  are  mainly  used  in  phase  control
applications such as in ac regulators for lighting and fan control and in solid-state ac relays.
