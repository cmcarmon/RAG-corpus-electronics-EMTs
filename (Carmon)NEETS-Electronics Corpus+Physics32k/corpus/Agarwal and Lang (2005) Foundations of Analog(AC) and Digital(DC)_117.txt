All circuit model discussions in this book are predicated on the assumption
that the frequencies involved are low enough that the effects of the fields can be
adequately modeled by lumped elements. In Chapters 1 through 8, we assume
that the frequencies involved are even lower so we can ignore all capacitive and
inductive effects as well.
