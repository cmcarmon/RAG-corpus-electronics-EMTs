Fusion splicing yields typically vary between 25 and 75 percent depending on the strength and loss
requirements for the splice and other factors. Other factors affecting splice yields include the condition of
the splicing machine, the experience of the splice personnel, and environmental conditions. Since fusion
splicing is inherently permanent, an unacceptable fusion splice requires breakage and refabrication of the
splice.
