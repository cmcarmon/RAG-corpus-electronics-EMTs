Special scale relativity predicts the value of the strong nuclear force with great precision, as later experimental measurements confirmed. The first prediction of the strong nuclear force at the Z energy level was made in 1992:
αS (mZ) = 0.1165 ± 0.0005
A recent and refined theoretical estimate gives:
αS (mZ) = 0.1173 ± 0.0004,
which fits very well with the experimental measure:
αS (mZ) = 0.1176 ± 0.0009
