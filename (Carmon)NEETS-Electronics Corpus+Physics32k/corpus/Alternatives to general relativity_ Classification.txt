Theories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:
an 'action' (see the principle of least action, a variational principle based on the concept of action)
a Lagrangian density
a metric
If a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say



L



{\displaystyle L\,}
, then the gravitational part of the action



S



{\displaystyle S\,}
is the integral of that.

{\displaystyle S=\int L{\sqrt {-g}}\,\mathrm {d} ^{4}x}

In this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have



g

1



{\displaystyle g=-1\,}
at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the Einstein–Hilbert action uses




L

∝

R


{\displaystyle L\,\propto \,R}

where R is the scalar curvature, a measure of the curvature of space.
Almost every theory described in this article has an action. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of MOND did not have an action.
A few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead (1922), the action there is termed non-local.
A theory of gravity is a "metric theory" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:Condition 1: There exists a symmetric metric tensor

μ
ν





{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }\,}
of signature (−, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:

A word here about Mach's principle is appropriate because a few of these theories rely on Mach's principle (e.g. Whitehead (1922)), and many mention it in passing (e.g. Einstein–Grossmann (1913), Brans–Dicke (1961)). Mach's principle can be thought of a half-way-house between Newton and Einstein. It goes this way:
Newton: Absolute space and time.
Mach: The reference frame comes from the distribution of matter in the universe.
Einstein: There is no reference frame.
So far, all the experimental evidence points to Mach's principle being wrong, but it has not entirely been ruled out.
