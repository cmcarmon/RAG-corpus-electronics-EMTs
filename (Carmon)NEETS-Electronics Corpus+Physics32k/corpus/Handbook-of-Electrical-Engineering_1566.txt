Applications
The  use  of  speech  as  a  means  of  input,  in  a  fashion  similar  to  the  use  of  the  keyboard  and  the  mouse,  has
resulted in the application of speech recognition to a wide set of Ô¨Åelds. These can be broadly divided into three
segments: desktop, telephony, and embedded systems.
