An integrated circuit incorporates anywhere from a 
few dozen to many billions (yes — billions!) of cir-
cuit components into a single device that fits easily 
into the palm of your hand. Each IC contains an 
intricate mesh of tiny transistor‐based taskmasters, 
with access to the outside world provided by a finite 
number of inputs and outputs.
