indirectly. Your wrist watch (if nondigital); your car's speedometer; and oil pressure, temperature, and 
fuel gauges are also considered analog computers. The output of an analog computer is often an 
adjustment to the control of a machine; such as, an adjustment to a valve that controls the flow of steam to 
a turbine generator or a temperature setting to control the ovens in the ship's galley for baking. Analog 
computers are also used for controlling processes. To do so, they must convert analog data to digital form, 
process it, and then convert the digital results back to analog form.
