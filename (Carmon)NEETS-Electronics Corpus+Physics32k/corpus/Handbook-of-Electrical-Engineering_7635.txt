the possibilities for digital optical circuitry based on cascadable all-optical logic gates. Although there have been
many different all-optical gates demonstrated, this section will only brieï¬‚y review the soliton gate (single-pass)
and one example of the nonlinear Fabry-Perot structures (cavity-based).
