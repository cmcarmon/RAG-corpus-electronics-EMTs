ripple. Microstrip-fed patches have very narrow bandwidths,
almost invariably less than 5%. Other feed mechanisms have
been used to increased bandwidth,
including proximity
coupling and aperture coupling, both of which require multi-
layer fabrication. A review of this technology is discussed in
Pozar (1992). Alternatively, matched bandwidth of the antenna
can be increased by making the antenna substrate electrically
thicker, effectively lowering the Q-factor of the antenna cavity
for increased bandwidth. High levels of TM0 surface waves,
however, can result and therefore reduce the radiation efﬁ-
ciency as well as degrade the radiation pattern if the surface
wave generates radiation (which can occur at the edge of ﬁnite
ground antennas). The problem of electrically thick substrate
is also a common one for high-frequency antennas on high-
permittivity substrates, and high amounts of TM surface waves
can result.
