A body is regarded as sliding along any small circular arc Ce between the radii KC and Ke, with centre K fixed. The first stage of the proof involves finding the particular circular arc, Mm which the body traverses in the minimum time.
The line KNC intersects AL at N, and Kne at n, and they make a small angle at K. Let NK = a, and define a variable point, C on KN extended with NC = x. Of all the possible circular arcs Ce, it is required to find the arc Mm which requires the minimum time to slide between the 2 radii, KM and Km. The speed of the body is assumed to be constant and to be that of a body having reached C by falling from the horizontal line AL under the action of a constant acceleration. Consequently, the speed at C is as the square root of CG, the vertical distance of C below the horizontal line, AL. Ce is proportional to the radius KC and the fixed angle, NKn.

{\displaystyle dt\propto {\frac {(x-a)dx}{2x^{\frac {3}{2}}}}}
. The stationary condition, dt = 0, occurs when x = a.
The curve AMmB, from point A to B is assumed to be the one that the body slides along in the shortest time possible. By dividing the curve into a large number of circular arcs, all subtending the same infinitesimal angle, NKn at their centre of curvature, from the minimum condition above, the radius joining each arc to its centre of curvature must be bisected by the horizontal line, AL containing the start point, A. This is a well-known property of the cycloid.
