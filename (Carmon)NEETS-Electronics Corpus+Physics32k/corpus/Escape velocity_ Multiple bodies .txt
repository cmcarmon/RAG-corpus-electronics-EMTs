When escaping a compound system, such as a moon orbiting a planet or a planet orbiting a sun, a rocket that leaves at escape velocity (




v

e

{\displaystyle v_{e1}}
) for the first (orbiting) body, (e.g. Earth) will not travel to an infinite distance because it needs an even higher speed to escape gravity of the second body (e.g. the Sun). Near the Earth, the rocket's trajectory will appear parabolic, but it will still be gravitationally bound to the second body and will enter an elliptical orbit around that body, with a similar orbital speed to the first body.
To escape the gravity of the second body once it has escaped the first body the rocket will need to be travelling at the escape velocity for the second body (

{\displaystyle v_{e2}}
) (at the orbital distance of the first body). However, when the rocket escapes the first body it will still have the same orbital speed around the second body that the first body has (




v

o




{\displaystyle v_{o}}
). So its excess velocity as it escapes the first body will need to be the difference between the orbital velocity and the escape velocity. With a circular orbit, escape velocity is √2 times the orbital speed. Thus the total escape velocity
