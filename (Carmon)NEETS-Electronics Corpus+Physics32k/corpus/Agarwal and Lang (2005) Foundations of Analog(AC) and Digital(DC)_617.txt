Let us apply the piecewise linear analysis method to the circuit in Figure 4.25(a). Specifi-
cally, let us determine the voltage vD across the nonlinear device for various values of
the current I sourced by the independent current source. Specifically, we will deter-
mine vD for I = 1 mA, I = âˆ’1 mA, and when I is a sinusoidal current of the form
0.002 A cos
