Let us consider the terms as follows:
V.D.= vapour density M.M.= molecular mass STP= standard temperature and pressure
Now, the definition of molecular mass is,"the ratio of mass of 1 molecule of a substance to the ratio of mass of 1 molecule of hydrogen at STP"
So,V.D=mass of 1 mole of gas at STP/mass of 1 mole of hydrogen at STP
Since hydrogen is diatomic: V.D.=mass Of 1 mole of a gas at STP/2×mass of 1 atom of hydrogen at STP
We know from the definition of vapour density that it is the ratio of mass of 1 mole of a gas to the ratio of mass of 1 atom of gas at STP
Therefore, 2×V.D.=M.M Hence molecular mass is twice the vapour density.
Relation between molar volume of gas at STP: According to Avogadro's hypothesis we have come to know that the molar volume of a gas at STP is 22.4 litres
