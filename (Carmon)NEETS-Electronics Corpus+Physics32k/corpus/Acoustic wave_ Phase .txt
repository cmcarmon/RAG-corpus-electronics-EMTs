In a travelling wave pressure and particle velocity are in phase, which means the phase angle between the two quantities is zero.
This can be easily proven using the ideal gas law

Consider a volume

From this equation it can be seen that when pressure is at its maximum, displacement reaches zero. As mentioned before, the oscillating pressure for a rightward travelling wave can be given by

{\displaystyle p=p_{0}cos(\omega t-kx)}

Since displacement is maximum when pressure is zero there is a 90 degrees phase difference, so displacement is given by

{\displaystyle x=x_{0}sin(\omega t-kx)}

Particle velocity is the first derivative of particle displacement. Differentiation of a sine gives a cosine again

This fact is exploited within the field of thermoacoustics.
