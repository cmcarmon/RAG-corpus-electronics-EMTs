Two-Terminal Active Microwave Devices
The IMPATT diode, transferred electron device, and tunnel diode are the most commonly used two-terminal
devices. These devices can operate from the low microwave through high millimeter-wave frequencies. They
were the ﬁrst semiconductor devices that could provide useful RF power levels at microwave and millimeter-
wave frequencies. The three devices are similar in that they are fabricated from blocks of semiconductors and
require  two  electrodes  (anode  and  cathode)  for  supplying  dc  bias.  The  same  electrodes  are  used  for  the  RF
port, and since only two electrodes are available, the devices must be operated as a one-port network. This is
generally  accomplished  by  mounting  the  semiconductor  in  a  pin-type  package.  The  package  can  then  be
positioned in an RF circuit or resonant cavity and the top and bottom pins on the package used as the dc and
RF electrical contacts. This arrangement works quite well and packaged devices can be operated up to about
90–100  GHz.  For  higher-frequency  operation,  the  devices  are  generally  mounted  directly  into  circuits  using
microstrip or some other similar technology.
