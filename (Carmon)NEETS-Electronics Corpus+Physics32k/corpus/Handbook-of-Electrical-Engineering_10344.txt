Interface Capabilities
Most  VSAT  systems  support  common  data  communications  protocols  such  as  SDLC,  X.25,  Async,  Bisync,
TCP/IP, etc. Coexistence of different protocols is allowed in a network. A VSAT supports multiple ports with
protocol spooÔ¨Ång
common interfaces such as RS232C, RS422, V.35, etc. VSAT networks typically must provide 
to provide acceptable delay and throughput performance to the end-user application. To minimize the effect
of satellite delay, the host computer front-end processor is emulated at the VSAT location, and multiple cluster
controllers  are  emulated  at  the  hub  location.  The  polling  associated  with  the  front-end  processor  to  cluster
controller communication is not carried on the satellite link, but is instead emulated locally.
