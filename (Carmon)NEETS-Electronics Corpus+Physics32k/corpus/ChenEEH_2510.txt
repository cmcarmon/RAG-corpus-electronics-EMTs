are commercially available in the form of surface-mountable
chips for hybrid integration or in standard MMIC processes. For
inductors and capacitors, the most important parameter is the
quality (Q-) factor in addition to the characteristic value of the
element. The Q-factor, which is used to measure the loss effects,
depends on conductor and dielectric dissipation properties of
the structure at a given frequency and can be calculated from the
equivalent RGLC (resistance conductance inductance capaci-
tance) model of the element.
