H.263 Video Coding for Low Bit-Rate Communications
The H.263 standard is aimed at video communications over
POTS and wireless networks at very low data rates (as low as 18
to 64 Kbps). Improvements in this standard result from the
incorporation of such features as half-pixel motion estimation,
overlapping and variable blocks sizes, bidirectional temporal
prediction,7 and improved variable-length coding options
(H. 263, 1995).
