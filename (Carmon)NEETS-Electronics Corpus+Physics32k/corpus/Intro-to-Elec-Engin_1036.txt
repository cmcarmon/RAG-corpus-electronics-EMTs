The pulsating torque, which may be acceptable in small machines, is, in general,
an undesirable feature in a rotating machine working as either a generator or a
motor, since it may result in speed ﬂuctuation, vibration, noise, and a waste of
energy. In magnetic-ﬁeld systems excited by single-phase alternating sources, the
torque pulsates while the speed is relatively constant. Consequently, pulsating power
becomes a feature. This calls for improvement; in fact, by employing polyphase
windings and polyphase sources, constant power is developed in a balanced system.
