We can draw a lesson from history. The invention of virtual
memory is a milestone in computing: virtual memory frees
programmers from speciﬁc machine storage details when
developing applications. Run-time reconﬁguration can be
considered the processing equivalent of virtual memory.
Multimillion gate FPGAs are beginning to appear, opening
the door to applications that once were never thought to be
implementable on FPGAs. The need for more resources, how-
ever, will never end. Run-time reconﬁguration provides a
mechanism for emulating an unlimited amount of gates. For
run-time reconﬁgurable hardware to become as big a success as
virtual memory,
it needs to be as easy to use as virtual
memory—to be completely transparent to the user. By auto-
mating run-time reconﬁguration, application developers for
conﬁgurable computing should seldom have to worry about
the amount of chip utilization.
