Permittivity is typically associated with dielectric materials, however metals are described as having an effective permittivity, with real relative permittivity equal to one. In the low-frequency region, which extends from radio frequencies to the far infrared and terahertz region, the plasma frequency of the electron gas is much greater than the electromagnetic propagation frequency, so the complex index n of a metal is practically a purely imaginary number. In the low frequency regime, the effective relative permittivity is also almost purely imaginary: it has a very large imaginary value related to the conductivity and a comparatively insignificant real-value.
