Making the observation that the voltages at points x and y are the same, we can
transform the circuit into the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 3.100. We can then
transform the circuits in Figures 3.100a and 3.100b into their Th√©venin equivalent net-
works. Figure 3.100a will have a source voltage of VR2/(R1 + R2) and an equivalent
resistance of R1(cid:2)R2. Figure 3.100b will have a source voltage of VR5/(R4 + R5) and
an equivalent resistance of R4(cid:2)R5.
The new circuit is shown in Figure 3.101. Notice that the new circuit is much easier
to analyze. We leave the rest of the analysis as an exercise for you.
