or resonant cavity, oscillators or ampliﬁers can be fabricated. The device is not actually a diode since no pn or
Schottky junction is used. The phenomenon is a characteristic of the bulk material and the special structure
of the conduction bands in certain compound semiconductors. Most semiconductors do not have the conduc-
tion band structure necessary for the transferred electron effect. The term Gunn diode is actually a misnomer
since the device is not a diode. TEDs are widely used in oscillators from the microwave through high millimeter-
wave  frequency  bands.  They  have  good  RF  output  power  capability  (milliwatts  to  watts  level),  moderate
efﬁciency  (<20%),  and  excellent  noise  and  bandwidth  capability.  Octave  band  tunable  oscillators  are  easily
fabricated using devices such as YIG (yttrium iron garnet) resonators or varactors as the tuning element. Most
commercially available solid-state sources for 60- to 100-GHz operation generally use InP TEDs.
