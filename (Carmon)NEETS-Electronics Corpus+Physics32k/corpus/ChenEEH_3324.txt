The power system in practice is constantly undergoing changes
because of such factors as changing loads, planned outages of
equipment for maintenance or other disturbances (e.g., equip-
ment failures, line faults, lightning strikes etc), or any number
of other events that cause outages. During disturbances, the
precise balance between generation and load is not main-
tained. These disturbances may lead to oscillations, and the
system must be able to dampen these and reach a viable
steady-state operating condition. Extremely fast electromag-
netic transients, such as those that arise from lightning strikes
or switching actions, are not considered from a system point of
view, hence, the network models introduced in the previous
