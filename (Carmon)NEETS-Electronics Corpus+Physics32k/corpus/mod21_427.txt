The bridge method permits measurement of the standing-wave ratio without actually measuring the
standing waves. The bridge method is applicable because the input impedance of a line terminated in its
characteristic impedance is a pure resistance equal to the characteristic impedance. A line terminated in
this way can be used as the unknown resistance in a bridge circuit and a null can be obtained in the
indicating device when the other resistance arms of the bridge are properly adjusted.
