All particles are initially massless under the Standard Model, since there are no Dirac mass terms in the Standard Model's Lagrangian. The only mass terms are generated by the Higgs mechanism, which produces non-zero Yukawa couplings between the left-handed components of fermions, the Higgs field, and their right-handed components. This occurs when the SU(2) doublet Higgs field

Such is the case for charged leptons, like the electron; but within the standard model, the right-handed neutrino does not exist, so even with a Yukawa coupling neutrinos remain massless. In other words, there are no mass terms for neutrinos under the Standard Model: the model only contains a left-handed neutrino and its antiparticle, a right-handed antineutrino, for each generation, produced in weak eigenstates during weak interactions. See neutrino masses in the Standard Model for a detailed explanation.
In the seesaw mechanism, one eigenvector of the neutrino mass matrix, which includes sterile neutrinos, is predicted to be significantly heavier than the other.
A sterile neutrino would have the same weak hypercharge, weak isospin, and mass as its antiparticle. For any charged particle, for example the electron, this is not the case: its antiparticle, the positron, has opposite electric charge, among other opposite charges. Similarly, an up quark has a charge of +​ 2⁄3 and (for example) a color charge of red, while its antiparticle has an electric charge of −​ 2⁄3 and a color charge of anti-red.
