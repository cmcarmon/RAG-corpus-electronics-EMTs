At the receiving end, the image is reconstructed by using a cathode-
ray tube (CRT) located in the TV receiver.3 The CRT is depicted in Fig.
1.17.  Unlike  the  iconoscope  tube,  which  produces  an  electron  beam  of
constant  intensity,  the  CRT beam  varies  in  intensity  according  to  the
incoming  signal. The  electron  gun,  maintained  at  a  high  potential,  ﬁres
the electron beam. The beam passes through two sets of plates for ver-
tical and horizontal deﬂections so that the spot on the screen where the
beam strikes can move right and left and up and down. When the elec-
tron  beam  strikes  the  ﬂuorescent  screen,  it  gives  off  light  at  that  spot.
Thus, the beam can be made to “paint” a picture on the TV screen.
