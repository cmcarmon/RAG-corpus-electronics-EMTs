Noise Limitations
The deﬁnition of CNR deserves clariﬁcation. Depending on the video format and RF modulation technique,
the RF power spectrum of the modulated RF carrier varies widely. For AM-VSB video the remaining carrier is
the  dominant  feature  in  the  spectrum.  It  is  thereby  convenient  to  deﬁne  the  CNR  as  the  ratio  of  the  power
remaining in the carrier to the integrated noise power in a 4-MHz bandwidth centered on the carrier frequency.
For  FM  or  digitally  modulated  carriers,  the  original  carrier  is  not  generally  visible  in  the  RF  spectrum.  It  is
then necessary to deﬁne the CNR as the ratio of the integrated signal power within the channel bandwidth to
the integrated noise power.
