Before turning on power to the circuit after the am-
meter is installed, set the meter to its highest scale (its 
highest ammeter range before applying power). After 
the power is applied, the ammeter can be set to the ap-
propriate scale. This prevents the needle of the meter 
from being driven into its stop.
