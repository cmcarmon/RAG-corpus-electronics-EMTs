During the early-nineteenth century, cutting methods involved hand tools and cranks, which were often lengthy in procedure. Joseph Whitworth changed this by creating the quick return mechanism in the mid-1800s. Using kinematics, he determined that the force and geometry of the rotating joint would affect the force and motion of the connected arm. From an engineering standpoint, the quick return mechanism impacted the technology of the Industrial Revolution by minimizing the duration of a full revolution, thus reducing the amount of time needed for a cut or press.
