Oscilloscopes have a high input impedance and normally will not load down the circuit under test.
However, oscilloscopes are primarily designed for waveform observation and are typically less accurate
than other pieces of test equipment used to measure dc voltages. A distinct advantage of the oscilloscope
is its ability to monitor the level of ac ripple voltage riding the dc voltage. This feature makes the
oscilloscope an indispensable aid in troubleshooting dc power supplies with excessive ripple caused by
component failure.
