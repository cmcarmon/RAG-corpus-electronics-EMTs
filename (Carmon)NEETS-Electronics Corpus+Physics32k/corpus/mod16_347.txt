Up to this point, we have been discussing the 100-microampere D’Arsonval movement and its use as
an ammeter. However, it can also be used to measure voltage if a MULTIPLIER (high resistance) is
placed in series with the moving coil of the meter. For low-voltage instruments, this resistance is
physically mounted inside the meter case with the D’Arsonval movement. The series resistance is
constructed of a wire-wound resistance that has a low temperature coefficient wound on either a spool or
