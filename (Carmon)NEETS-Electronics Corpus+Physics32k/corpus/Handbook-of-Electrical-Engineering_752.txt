Cotree:  The complement of a tree in a network.
Cutset:  A minimal subnetwork, the removal of which cuts the original network into two connected pieces.
Cutset system: A secondary system of equations using cutset voltages as variables.
Input vector: A vector formed by the input variables to a network.
Link: An element of a cotree.
Loop system:  A secondary system of equations using loop currents as variables.
Nodal system: A secondary system of equations using nodal voltages as variables.
Nondegenerate  network:  A  network  that  contains  neither  a  circuit  composed  only  of  capacitors  and/or
independent or dependent voltage sources nor a cutset composed only of inductors and/or independent
or dependent current sources.
