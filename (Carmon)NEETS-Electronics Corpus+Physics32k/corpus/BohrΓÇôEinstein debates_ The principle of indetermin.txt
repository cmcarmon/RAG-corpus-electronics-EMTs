In many textbook examples and popular discussions of quantum mechanics, the principle of indeterminacy is explained by reference to the pair of variables position and velocity (or momentum). It is important to note that the wave nature of physical processes implies that there must exist another relation of indeterminacy: that between time and energy. In order to comprehend this relation, it is convenient to refer to the experiment illustrated in Figure D, which results in the propagation of a wave which is limited in spatial extension. Assume that, as illustrated in the figure, a ray which is extremely extended longitudinally is propagated toward a screen with a slit furnished with a shutter which remains open only for a very brief interval of time



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
. Beyond the slit, there will be a wave of limited spatial extension which continues to propagate toward the right.
A perfectly monochromatic wave (such as a musical note which cannot be divided into harmonics) has infinite spatial extent. In order to have a wave which is limited in spatial extension (which is technically called a wave packet), several waves of different frequencies must be superimposed and distributed continuously within a certain interval of frequencies around an average value, such as




ν

0




{\displaystyle \nu _{0}}
. It then happens that at a certain instant, there exists a spatial region (which moves over time) in which the contributions of the various fields of the superposition add up constructively. Nonetheless, according to a precise mathematical theorem, as we move far away from this region, the phases of the various fields, at any specified point, are distributed causally and destructive interference is produced. The region in which the wave has non-zero amplitude is therefore spatially limited. It is easy to demonstrate that, if the wave has a spatial extension equal to



Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}
(which means, in our example, that the shutter has remained open for a time



Δ
t
=
Δ
x

/

v


{\displaystyle \Delta t=\Delta x/v}
where v is the velocity of the wave), then the wave contains (or is a superposition of) various monochromatic waves whose frequencies cover an interval



Δ
ν


{\displaystyle \Delta \nu }
which satisfies the relation:




Δ
ν
≥


1

Δ
t



.


{\displaystyle \Delta \nu \geq {\frac {1}{\Delta t}}.}

Remembering that in the universal relation of Planck, frequency and energy are proportional:




E
=
h
ν



{\displaystyle E=h\nu \,}

it follows immediately from the preceding inequality that the particle associated with the wave should possess an energy which is not perfectly defined (since different frequencies are involved in the superposition) and consequently there is indeterminacy in energy:




Δ
E
=
h

Δ
ν

h

Δ

.


{\displaystyle \Delta E=h\,\Delta \nu \geq {\frac {h}{\Delta t}}.}

From this it follows immediately that:




Δ

Δ
t

h


{\displaystyle \Delta E\,\Delta t\geq h}

which is the relation of indeterminacy between time and energy.
