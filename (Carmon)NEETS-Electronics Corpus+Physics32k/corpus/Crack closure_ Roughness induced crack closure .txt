This concept explains the crack closure phenomena in mode 2 type of loading. Due to heterogeneity in micro structure, microscopic roughness of fatigue fracture surfaces is present. As a result, mismatch can occur between the upper and lower crack faces during displacement in mode 2 loading. These mismatch wedges open the crack, resulting in crack closure.
Roughness induced crack closure is hence a result of slipping of crack faces leading to faceted crack morphology and is justifiable or valid when the roughness of the surface is of same order as the crack opening displacement. It is influenced by grain size, loading history,material mechanical properties and load ratio. Also, the slip of crack faces occur at low Î”K and R ratios. Ageing of the specimen also influences the crack closure. Comparing under aged and hyper overaged conditions crack closure due to roughness was greater in under aged specimens in which planar slip dominated.
It was also found that crack closure due to surface roughness was influenced by grain size to a greater extend. The extent of crack closure was found to increase with increase in grain size, especially at low load ratios. Specimen type is also a factor influencing crack closure. Roughness induced crack closure is generally used to describe contact of faceted fracture features which are dimensionally small (of the order of grain size). However there are situations where crack closure can occur due to crack branching or deflection.
