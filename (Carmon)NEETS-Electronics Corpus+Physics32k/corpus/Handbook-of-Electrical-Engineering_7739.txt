Solid-State Disks
Solid-state disks (SSD), constructed from relatively slow memory chips, can be viewed either as a kind of large
and slow main memory or as a small and high-speed disk. When viewed as large main memory, the SSD is
often called expanded storage (ES). The expanded storage found in the IBM 3090 class machines [Buzen and
Shum,  1986]  supports  operations  for  paging  data  blocks  from  and  to  main  memory.  Usually,  the  expanded
storage  looks  to  the  system  more  like  memory  than  an  I/O  device:  it  is  directly  attached  to  main  memory
through a high-speed bus rather than an I/O controller. The maximum transfer bandwidth on the IBM 3090
between expanded store and memory is two orders of magnitude faster than conventional devices: approxi-
