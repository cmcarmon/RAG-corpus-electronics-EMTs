Equation 11.18 shows that the average power is the sum of two terms. The
first term is independent of the time period of the square wave and is called the
static power pstatic. It can be computed independently by removing all capacitors
and inductors from the circuit (in other words, replace the capacitors with open
circuits and inductors with short circuits). The second term is related to the
charging and discharging of the capacitor, and depends on the time period
of the square wave. This term is called the dynamic power pdynamic. In other
words,
