The Hoeckens linkage is a four-bar mechanism that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion. It is named after Karl Hoecken (1874âˆ’1962).
The example to the right spends over half of the cycle in the near straight portion.
The Hoeckens linkage is a cognate linkage of the Chebyshev linkage.
The linkage was first published in 1926.
A generalization of Hoeckens linkage is Wittgenstein's rod.
