Discovering how to read a schematic is a little like learning a foreign lan-
guage. On the whole, youâ€™ll find that most schematics follow fairly standard 
conventions. However, just as many languages have different dialects, the 
language of schematics is far from universal. Schematics can vary depend-
ing on the age of the diagram, its country of origin, the whim of the circuit 
designer, and many other factors.
