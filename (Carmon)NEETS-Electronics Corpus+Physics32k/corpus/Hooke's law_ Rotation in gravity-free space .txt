If the mass m were attached to a spring with force constant k and rotating in free space, the spring tension (Ft) would supply the required centripetal force (Fc):

r


{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {t} }=kx\,;\qquad F_{\mathrm {c} }=m\omega ^{2}r}

Since Ft = Fc and x = r, then:




k

{\displaystyle k=m\omega ^{2}}

Given that ω = 2πf, this leads to the same frequency equation as above:

{\displaystyle f={\frac {1}{2\pi }}{\sqrt {\frac {k}{m}}}}
