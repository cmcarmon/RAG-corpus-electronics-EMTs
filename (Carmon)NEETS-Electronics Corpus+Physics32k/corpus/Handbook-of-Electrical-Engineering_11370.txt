FIGURE 116.3 Concept of magnetic resonance imaging. The static magnetic Ô¨Åeld H0 has a gradient such that excitation
at frequency f0 excites only the plane P. Gradient Gy in the y direction is applied for time tyi, causing a phase shift along the
y direction. Gradient Gx in the x direction is applied for time tx, causing a frequency shift along the x direction. Repetition
of this process for different tyi allows the receive coil to pick up a signal which is the two-dimensional Fourier transform of
the magnetic resonance effect within the slice.
