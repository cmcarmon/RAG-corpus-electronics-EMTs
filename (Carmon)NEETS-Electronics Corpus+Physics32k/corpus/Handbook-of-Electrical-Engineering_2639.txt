*VD with QG = the charge on the gate electrode.
where CG is the oxide capacitance of the device, CG = ¶QG/¶VG
The  frequency  wT  is  a  measure  of  the  small-signal,  high-frequency  speed  of  the  device,  neglecting  parasitic
resistances. Using Eq. (24.43) in Eq. (24.49) we ﬁnd that the transition frequency also is related to the transit
time L/usat of Eq. (24.45), so that both the digital and small-signal circuit speeds are related to this parameter.
Output Resistance and Drain Conductance
For  small-signal  circuits  the  output  resistance  ro  of  the  MOSFET  [Sedra  and  Smith,  1991]  is  important  in
limiting the gain of ampliﬁers. This resistance is related to the small-signal drain conductance gD in saturation by
