one at a time when a trigger signal is applied to pin 14. (They don’t go from 
low to high in strict counterclockwise order; you have to check the pinout to 
determine the order.) You can use the count outputs to light LEDs (as in the 
light chaser and traffic light projects in Chapter 17) or trigger a one‐shot that 
controls another circuit.
