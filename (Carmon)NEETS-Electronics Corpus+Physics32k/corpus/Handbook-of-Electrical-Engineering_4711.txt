The phase velocities in isotropic solids are often expressed in terms of the so-called Lame constants deÔ¨Åned by
m
 = 
. The longitudinal velocity is larger than the shear velocity. Exact velocity values

depend on fabrication procedures and purity, but Table 48.1 gives typical values for some materials important
in ultrasonics.
