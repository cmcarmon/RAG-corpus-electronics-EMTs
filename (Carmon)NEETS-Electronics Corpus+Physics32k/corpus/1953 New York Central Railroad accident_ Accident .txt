The Interstate Commerce Commission investigated the accident. Their findings indicated that the lading of Baltimore and Ohio 254645 was not properly secured for movement when loaded because the high tension bands were not properly sealed. Because the lading was not properly secured, a portion fell from the car while in transit. When the pipes fell from the car in question, one piece became wedged between the track structure of track No. 1 and the next car, a box car. As the train proceeded at a speed of 36 miles per hour the resultant thrust transmitted by the pipe to track No. 1 moved track No. 1 northward a distance of about 18 inches before the pipe fell clear of the cars. The damaged condition of the track was not observed before No. 5 arrived at the point of accident. The track was sufficiently damaged to cause the derailment of No. 5 which in turn caused the derailment of Extra 1736 West. No. 12 struck the derailed equipment of No. 5 before protection could be provided.
