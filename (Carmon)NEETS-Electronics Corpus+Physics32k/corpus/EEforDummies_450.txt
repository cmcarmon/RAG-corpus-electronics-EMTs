Calculating RC time constants
By choosing the values of the capacitor and the resistor carefully, you can 
adjust a capacitorâ€™s charge and discharge time. As it turns out, your choice of 
resistance, R, and capacitance, C, defines the time it takes to charge and dis-
charge your chosen capacitor through your chosen resistor. If you multiply 
R (in ohms) by C (in farads), you get what is known as the RC time constant of 
your RC circuit, symbolized by T. And that makes another handy formula:
