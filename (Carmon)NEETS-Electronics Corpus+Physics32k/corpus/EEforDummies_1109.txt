It’s an ammeter!
Your multimeter also functions as an ammeter, a device that measures the 
electric current going through a circuit. You use this function of the multi-
meter to determine whether a circuit or component is drawing too much 
current. If your circuit has more current going through it than it’s designed 
to handle, the components may get overheated and damage your circuit 
 permanently.
