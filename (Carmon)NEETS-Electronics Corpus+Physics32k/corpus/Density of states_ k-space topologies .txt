The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is Energy−1Volume−1 , in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy−1Area−1 , in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is Energy−1Length−1. It is important to note that the volume being referenced is the volume of k-space; the space enclosed by the constant energy surface of the system derived through a dispersion relation that relates E to k. An example of a 3-dimensional k-space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system itself will confine the momentum of particles inside the system.
