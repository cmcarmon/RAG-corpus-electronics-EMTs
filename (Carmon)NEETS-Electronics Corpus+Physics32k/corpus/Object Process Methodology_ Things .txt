An OPM thing is a generalization of object and process. Objects and processes are symmetric in many regards and have much in common in terms of relations, such as aggregation, generalization, and characterization. OPM objects and OPM processes depend on each other in the sense that an object cannot be transformed without a process, while a process cannot happen without transforming at least one object.
To apply OPM in a useful manner, the modeler has to make the essential distinction between objects and processes, as a prerequisite for successful system analysis and design. By default, a noun shall identify an object.
