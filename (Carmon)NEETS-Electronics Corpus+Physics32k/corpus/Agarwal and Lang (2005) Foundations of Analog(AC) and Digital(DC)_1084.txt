p r o b l e m 7.2 An inverting MOSFET amplifier is shown in Figure 7.74,
together with an iDS vDS characteristic for the MOSFET. This characteristic is simpler
than the SCS model presented in this chapter. The characteristic is simply the standard
MOSFET characteristic with the triode region compressed onto the y-axis.
