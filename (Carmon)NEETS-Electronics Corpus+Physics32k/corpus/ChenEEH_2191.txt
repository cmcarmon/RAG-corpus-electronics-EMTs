where L11 and L22 are the self-inductances of coils 1 and 2,
respectively, and L12( ¼ L21) is the mutual inductance between
the two coils. As expected, the ﬁrst two terms in equation 1.116
represent the magnetic energies stored in coils 1 and 2, respec-
tively, while the last term is the energy stored in the mutual
inductances of the two-coil system. One potential subtlety is
that these self-inductances in equation 1.116 are those com-
puted for a coil with the other one present but having a current
equal to zero (Paul et al., 1998).
