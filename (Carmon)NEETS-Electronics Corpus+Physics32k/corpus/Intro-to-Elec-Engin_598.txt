Network Topology
This deals with the geometrical arrangement of nodes (endpoints consisting of physical devices
such as terminals, printers, PCs, and mainframes) interconnected by links (transmission channels).
Network topologies may be classiÔ¨Åed as bus topology (multidrop topology), star topology, ring
topology, tree topology, and distributed (mesh or hybrid) topology, as illustrated in Figure 6.4.2.
Bus topology is used predominantly by LANs, whereas star topology is commonly used by
private-branch exchange (PBX) systems. Ring topology may have centralized control (with one
node as the controller) or decentralized control (with all nodes having equal status). Tree topology
is used in most of the remote-access networks, whereas distributed topology is common in public
and modern communications networks. A fully distributed network allows every set of nodes to
communicate directly with every other set through a single link and provides an alternative route
between nodes.
