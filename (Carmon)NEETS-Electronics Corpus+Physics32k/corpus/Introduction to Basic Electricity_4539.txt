Figure 44-31 shows the ROM family chart. The 
mask-programming process takes place during the 
manufacturing process. The transistor-emitter con-
nection is either made or not made through a mask 
during manufacture. The mask does the programming.
programmable read-only memory (pRoM) 
can be programmed after manufacture. The program 
is entered into the PROM by blowing a fusible link. 
Initially, all emitter links are connected as 1s in all 
storage locations. The emitter links where 0s occur are 
blown open with a high-current surge. PROMs cannot 
be reprogrammed.
