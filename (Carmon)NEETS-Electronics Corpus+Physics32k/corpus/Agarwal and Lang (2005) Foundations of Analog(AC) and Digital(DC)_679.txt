If a 3- resistor is connected across this new two-terminal element (the 100-cell array),
determine the terminal voltage across and the current through the resistor.

The junction field-effect transistor ( JFET) with the specific con-
nection shown in Figure 4.60a (gate and source shorted together) behaves as a two-
terminal device. The vD iD characteristics of the resulting two-terminal device shown
in Figure 4.60b saturates at current IDSS for vD greater than a voltage VP, called the
pinch-off voltage. In the two-terminal configuration shown, the JFET characteristic is
