and takes the ﬁrst 100 lines of inﬁle, adds line numbers, sorts it
in descending numerical order, and ﬁnally eliminates line
numbers and writes the result into outﬁle. In fact, this example
takes the ﬁrst 100 lines from inﬁle and reverses it so that the
100th line becomes the ﬁrst line and the ﬁrst line becomes the
100th line in outﬁle. These two examples demonstrate how
UNIX provides basic building blocks (numerous ﬁlters), each
of which does one job, as well as provides a mechanism for
them to be put together in almost limitless ways.
