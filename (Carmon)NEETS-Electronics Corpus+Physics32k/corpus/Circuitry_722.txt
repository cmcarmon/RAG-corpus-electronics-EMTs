Bipolar transistor current gain checks
 
Simple  go/no-go  checks  can  also  be  used  to 
determine whether a transistor is providing current 
gain. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 15.10. For 
an NPN transistor this is achieved by measuring the 
resistance between collector and emitter, as shown 
in Fig. 15.10(a), before applying a small amount of 
base current via a 100 kH resistor, as shown in Fig. 
15.10(b).  The  application  of  base  current  should
