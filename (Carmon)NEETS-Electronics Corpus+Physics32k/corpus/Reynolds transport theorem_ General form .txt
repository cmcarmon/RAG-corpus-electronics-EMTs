{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{\Omega (t)}\mathbf {f} \,dV=\int _{\Omega (t)}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {f} }{\partial t}}\,dV+\int _{\partial \Omega (t)}\left(\mathbf {v} ^{b}\cdot \mathbf {n} \right)\mathbf {f} \,dA}

in which n(x,t) is the outward-pointing unit normal vector, x is a point in the region and is the variable of integration, dV and dA are volume and surface elements at x, and vb(x,t) is the velocity of the area element (not the flow velocity). The function f may be tensor-, vector- or scalar-valued. Note that the integral on the left hand side is a function solely of time, and so the total derivative has been used.
