ignal processing was deﬁned at a meeting in 1991 of the National Science Foundation’s MIPS (Micro-
electronics and Information Processing Systems) Advisory Committee as “the extraction of information-
bearing attributes from measured data, and any subsequent transformation of those attributes for the
purposes of detection, estimation, classiﬁcation, or waveform synthesis.” If we expand this concise deﬁnition,
we  observe  that  the  signals  we  typically  use  in  signal  processing  are  functions  of  time,  such  as  temperature
measurements,  velocity  measurements,  voltages,  blood  pressures,  earth  motion,  and  speech  signals.  Most  of
these  signals  are  initially  continuous  signals  (also  called  analog  signals)  which  are  measured  by  sensors  that
convert energy to electricity. Some of the common types of sensors used for collecting data are microphones,
which measure acoustic or sound data; seismometers, which measure earth motion; photocells, which measure
light intensity; thermistors, which measure temperature; and oscilloscopes, which measure voltage. When we
