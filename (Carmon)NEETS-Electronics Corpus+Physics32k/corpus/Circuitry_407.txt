where  KVOUT  is  the  change  in  output  voltage  (in 
volts) and Kt is the corresponding interval of time 
(in s).  
  Slew  rate  is  measured  in  V/s  (or  V/µs)  and 
typical values range from 0.2 V/µs to over 20 V/µs. 
Slew rate imposes a limitation on circuits in which 
large amplitude pulses rather than small amplitude 
sinusoidal signals are likely to be encountered.
