Voltage regulators located in the substation or on a feeder are
used to keep the voltage constant at a Ô¨Åctitious regulation or
regulating point without regard to the magnitude or power
factor of the load. The regulating point is usually selected to
be somewhere between the regulator and the end of the feeder.
The automatic voltage maintenance is achieved by dial settings
of the adjustable resistance and reactance elements of a unit
called the line-drop compensator (LDC) located on the control
panel of the voltage regulator. Determination of the appropriate
dial settings depends on whether any load is tapped off the
feeder between the regulator and the regulating point.
