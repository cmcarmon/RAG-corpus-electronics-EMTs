In these equations R and G describe the recombination and generation rates for the electrons and holes. The
recombination process is inﬂuenced by factors such as the number of electrons and holes present as well as the
doping and temperature. The generation rate is also dependent upon the carrier concentrations, but is most
strongly inﬂuenced by the electric ﬁeld, with increasing electric ﬁelds giving larger generation rates. Because
this generation process is included, device simulators are capable of modeling the breakdown of devices at high
voltage. Jn and Jp are the electron and hole current densities (in amperes per square centimeter). These current
densities are given by another set of equations
