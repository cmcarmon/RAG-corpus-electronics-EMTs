Quality Numerical Software
Following the invention of FORTRAN there was a gradual development of useful general purpose subroutines
that could be archived into libraries, distributed, and shared. This lead eventually to the development of standard
subroutine libraries such as EIS-PACK [Smith et al., 1977], LINPACK [Dongarra et al., 1979], and LAPACK
[Anderson et al., 19789] (for solving eigenvalue problems and sets of linear equations) which have had a direct
inï¬‚uence on the development of CACSD.
