Doping: The intrinsic carrier concentration of semiconductors (e.g., Si) is too low to allow controlled charge
transport.  For  this  reason  some  impurities  called  dopants  are  purposely  added  to  the  semiconductor.
The process of adding dopants is called doping. Dopants may belong to group IIIA (e.g., boron) or group
VA  (e.g.,  phosphorus)  in  the  periodic  table.  If  the  elements  belong  to  the  group  IIIA,  the  resulting
semiconductor is called a p-type semiconductor. On the other hand, if the elements belong to the group
VA, the resulting semiconductor is called an n-type semiconductor.
