If required, farmers' responses to water logging and soil salinity can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:
the amount of irrigation water applied when the water table becomes shallower;
the fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce;
the fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a stochastic interpretation.
Response (1) is different for ponded (submerged) rice (paddy) and "dry foot" crops.

The responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in their turn, slow down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately an equilibrium situation will be brought about.

The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.
