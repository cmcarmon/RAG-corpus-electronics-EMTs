Each  logic  cell  must  be  connected  to  power  (Vdd)  and  ground  (Gnd),  requiring  that  external  power  and
ground connections to the IC be routed (on continuous metal lines to avoid resistive voltage drops) to each
logic cell on the IC. Early IC technologies provided only a single level of metallization on which to route power
and ground and an interdigitated layout, illustrated in Fig. 25.28(a), was adopted. Given this power and ground
layout  approach,  channels  of  pull-up  sections  and  channels  of  pull-down  sections  were  placed  between  the
power and ground interconnections, as illustrated in Fig. 25.28(b).
