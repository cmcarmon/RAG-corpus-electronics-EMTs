In ferroelectric materials a crystalline asymmetry exists which allows electric dipoles to form. In their absence
the dipoles are absent and the internal Ô¨Åeld disappears. Consider an imaginary horizontal line drawn through
the middle of a dipole. We can see readily that the dipole is not symmetric about that line. The asymmetry
thus requires that there be no center of inversion when the material is in the ferroelectric state.
