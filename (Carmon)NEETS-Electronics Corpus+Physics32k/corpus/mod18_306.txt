Crossed-field amplifiers have another advantage when used as the final stages of a transmitter; that
is, the design of the crossed-field amplifier allows rf energy to pass through the tube virtually unaffected
when the tube is not pulsed. When no pulse is present, the tube acts as a section of waveguide. Therefore,
if less than maximum output power is desired, the final and preceding cross-field amplifier stages can be
shut off as needed. This feature also allows a transmitter to operate at reduced power, even when the final
crossed-field amplifier is defective.
