To simulate circuits on computer, I make use of a particular program called SPICE, which
works by describing a circuit to the computer by means of a listing of text. In essence, this
listing is a kind of computer program in itself, and must adhere to the syntactical rules of
the SPICE language. The computer is then used to process, or ”run,” the SPICE program,
which interprets the text listing describing the circuit and outputs the results of its detailed
mathematical analysis, also in text form. Many details of using SPICE are described in volume
