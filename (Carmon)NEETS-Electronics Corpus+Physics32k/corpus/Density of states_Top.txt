In solid-state and condensed matter physics, the density of states (DOS) of a system describes the number of states per interval of energy at each energy level available to be occupied. It is mathematically represented by a density distribution and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. A high DOS at a specific energy level means that there are many states available for occupation. A DOS of zero means that no states can be occupied at that energy level. The DOS is usually represented by one of the symbols g, œÅ, D, n, or N.
Generally, the density of states of matter is continuous. In isolated systems however, like atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the density distribution is discrete like a spectral density.
Local variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often called local density of states (LDOS). If the DOS of an undisturbed system is zero, the LDOS can locally be non-zero due to the presence of a local potential.
