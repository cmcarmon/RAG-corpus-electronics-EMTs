You use the symbol R to represent resistance in an electronic circuit. 
Sometimes you’ll see a subscript next to a resistance, for instance, Rbulb. That 
just means that Rbulb represents the resistance of the light bulb (or whatever 
part of the circuit the subscript refers to). Resistance is measured in units 
called ohms (pronounced “omes”), abbreviated with the Greek letter omega 
(Ω). The higher the ohm value, the higher the resistance.
