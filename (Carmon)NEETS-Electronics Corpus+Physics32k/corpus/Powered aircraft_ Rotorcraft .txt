Rotorcraft have spinning blades called a rotor which spins in the horizontal plane to provide lift. Forward thrust is usually obtained by angling the rotor disc slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed backwards; these are called helicopters. Other rotorcraft are compound helicopters and autogyros which sometimes use other means of propulsion, such as propellers and jets.
The rotor of a helicopter may, like a propeller, be powered by a variety of methods such as an internal-combustion engine or jet turbine. Tip jets, fed by gases passing along hollow rotor blades from a centrally mounted engine, have been experimented with. Attempts have even been made to mount engines directly on the rotor tips.
