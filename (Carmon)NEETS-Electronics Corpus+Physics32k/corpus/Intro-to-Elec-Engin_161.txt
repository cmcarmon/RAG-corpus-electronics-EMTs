The node-voltage and mesh-current methods, which complement each other, are well-ordered
systematic methods of analysis for solving complicated network problems. The former is based
on the KCL equations, whereas the KVL equations form the basis for the latter. In both methods
an appropriate number of simultaneous algebraic equations are developed. The unknown nodal
voltages are found in the nodal method, whereas the unknown mesh currents are calculated in the
loop (or mesh) method. A decision to use one or the other method of analysis is usually based on
the number of equations needed for each method.
