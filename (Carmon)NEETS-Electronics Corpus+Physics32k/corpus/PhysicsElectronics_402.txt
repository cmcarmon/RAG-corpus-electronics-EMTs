When a signal drives an open-ended capacitor the average voltage level on the output termi-
nal of the capacitor is determined by the initial charge on that terminal and may therefore
be quite unpredictable. Thus it is necessary to connect the output to ground or some other
reference voltage via a large resistor. This action drains any excess charge and results in an
average or DC output voltage of zero.
