ﬁlters are low-pass ﬁlters whose cut-off frequencies are chosen to be less than w
M . Although the signal
will still not be able to be reconstructed exactly, the degradations are less annoying. Another problem in a real
system is the need for an ideal low-pass ﬁlter to reconstruct an analog signal. An ideal ﬁlter is not physically
realizable, so in practice an approximation must be made. Several very simple ﬁlter structures are common in
video systems: sample and hold, bilinear, and raised cosine.
