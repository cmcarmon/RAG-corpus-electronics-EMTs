Thankfully, the physics behind all this is mostly irrelevant to our purposes here. Sufﬁce it
to say that some materials are good conductors, some are poor conductors, and some are in be-
tween. For now it is good enough to simply understand that these distinctions are determined
by the conﬁguration of the electrons around the constituent atoms of the material.
