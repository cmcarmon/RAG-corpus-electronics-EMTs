The availability, A(t), of a system is deÔ¨Åned as the probability that a system will be available to perform its
tasks at the instant of time t. Intuitively, we can see that the availability can be approximated as the total time
that a system has been operational divided by the total time elapsed since the system was initially placed into
operation. In other words, the availability is the percentage of time that the system is available to perform its
expected tasks. Suppose that we place a system into operation at time t = 0. As time moves along, the system
will perform its functions, perhaps fail, and hopefully be repaired. At some time  t =  tcurren t, suppose that the
system has operated correctly for a total of top hours and has been in the process of repair or waiting for repair
to  begin  for  a  total  of  trepair hours.  The  time  tcurrent is  then  the  sum  of  top  and  trepair.  The  availability  can  be
determined as
