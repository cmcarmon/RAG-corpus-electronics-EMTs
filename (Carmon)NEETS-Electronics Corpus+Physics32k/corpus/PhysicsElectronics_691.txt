(c) Let Z1 = 1 kΩ and Z2 = 10 kΩ. Sketch a log-log plot showing the function G(ω)
for the above circuit assuming that a general purpose op-amp such as the 741 is
used.
(d) The 741 op-amp has a corner frequencies of 4 Hz, DC open-loop gain of 2 × 105
and a fall oﬀ at high frequency of 6 dB/octave. What is the frequency domain
over which the ampliﬁer deﬁned in part (c) will have constant gain? What is the
gain of the ampliﬁer in this frequency domain?
