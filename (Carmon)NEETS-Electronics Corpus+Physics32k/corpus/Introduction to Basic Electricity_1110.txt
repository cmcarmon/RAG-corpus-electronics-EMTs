Regulations require that all power tools be fitted 
with proper guards and safety	switches. Guards 
protect the operator of power tools from exposed 
moving parts. Safety switches are used to prevent a 
tool from accidentally turning on and may require a 
minimum of two actions to turn a power tool on. Be-
fore using any power tool, make sure the guards are in 
place and the switches are working properly.
