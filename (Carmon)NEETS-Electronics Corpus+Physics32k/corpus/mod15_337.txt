You may represent the three vectors listed above by arranging the thumb, forefinger, and middle 
finger of your right hand mutually perpendicular as shown in figure 3-10. Your thumb points in the 
direction of the precession vector, your middle finger points in the direction of the torque vector, and your 
forefinger points in the direction of the spin vector. You can consider these vectors as the axes about 
which angular motion takes place. If you look in the directions your fingers and thumb point, you can 
visualize that all the rotary motions are clockwise as indicated in figure 3-10.
