In this chapter, we combine an extension of the class of strict
feedback systems considered in Polycarpou (1996) and Poly-
carpou and Mears (1998) with the concept of a dynamic
structure that depends on time; this combination allows us
to propose a class of nonlinear systems with a time-varying
structure, for which we develop a direct adaptive control
approach. This class of systems is a generalization of the class
of strict feedback systems traditionally considered in the litera-
ture. Moreover, the direct adaptive control developed here is,
to our knowledge, the Ô¨Årst of its kind in this context, and it
presents several advantages with respect to indirect adaptive
methods, including the fact that it needs less plant information
to be implemented.
