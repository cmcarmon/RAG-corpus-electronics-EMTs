Global concerns and regulations associated with environmental issues are increasingly affecting the manufac-
turing  and  design  of  electronic  products,  their  technology  development,  and  marketing  strategies.  No  point
 scheme for personal computers (the Blue Angel
illustrates this better than the German Blue Angel 
is  a  quasi-governmental,  multi-attribute  eco-labeling  program).  The  Blue Angel  requirements  are  numerous
and span the complete life-cycle of the computers. Examples of some the requirements include: modular design
of the entire system, customer-replaceable subassemblies and modules, use of non-halogenated ﬂame retardants,
and take back by manufacturers at the end of the product life. Market requirements such as these, focused on
products and integrating as they do environmental and technology considerations, cannot possibly be met by
continuing to treat environmental impact as an unavoidable result of industrial activity, i.e., as overhead. These
requirements make environmental concerns truly strategic for the ﬁrm.
