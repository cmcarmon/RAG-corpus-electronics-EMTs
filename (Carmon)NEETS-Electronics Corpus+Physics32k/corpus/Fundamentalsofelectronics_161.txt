3.7 Equivalent Circuits: Resistors and Sources13
We have found that the way to think about circuits is to locate and group parallel and series resistor
combinations. Those resistors not involved with variables of interest can be collapsed into a single resistance.
This result is known as an equivalent circuit: from the viewpoint of a pair of terminals, a group of resistors
functions as a single resistor, the resistance of which can usually be found by applying the parallel and series
rules.
