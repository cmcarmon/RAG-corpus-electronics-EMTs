Solution:
we  set  the  independent  voltage  source  equal  to  zero  and

connect  a  voltage  source  of 
to  the  terminals.  We  obtain  the  circuit  in  Fig.  4.44(a).  We  ignore  the
4-⍀
resistor because it is short-circuited. Also due to the short circuit,
5-⍀
the 
resistor, the voltage source, and the dependent current source
are all in parallel. Hence,
