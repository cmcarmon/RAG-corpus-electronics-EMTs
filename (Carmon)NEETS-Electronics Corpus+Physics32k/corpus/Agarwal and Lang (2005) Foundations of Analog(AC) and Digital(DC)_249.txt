An electronic circuit is constructed by connecting together a collection of
separate elements at their terminals, as shown in Figure 2.2. The junction points
at which the terminals of two or more elements are connected are referred to as
the nodes of a circuit. Similarly, the connections between the nodes are referred
to as the edges or branches of a circuit. Note that each element in Figure 2.2
forms a single branch. Thus an element and a branch are the same for circuits
comprising only two-terminal elements. Finally, circuit loops are defined to be
closed paths through a circuit along its branches.
