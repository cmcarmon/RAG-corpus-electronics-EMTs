The Discrete-Observation Model
The discrete-observation HMM, a special case of model set
3.38, is restricted to the production of a ﬁnite set of observa-
tions. In this case, the naturally occurring observation vectors
are quantized into one of the permissible sets using a technique
known as vector quantization (VQ). In the VQ process, a large
population of continuous-observation vectors, assumed to be
statistically representative of all the features to be encountered
in a speech-recognition task, is partitioned into a ﬁxed number
of clusters, say K, typically using the K-means algorithm (Del-
ler et al., 2000; Devijver and Kittler, 1982). The centroids of the
clusters are assumed to be representative of the sounds associ-
