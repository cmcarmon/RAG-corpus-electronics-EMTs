The history of the developments leading up to modern DT
models for speech production is interesting and informative,
and it has great value in illuminating the present models (Fla-
nagan, 1972; Klatt, 1987; Morgan and Gold, 1999; Shafer and
Markel, 1979; Dudley, 1939). Circuit models developed early in
the 20th century, consisting mainly of band-pass ﬁlters (reson-
ators) to simulate formant spectra, represent the ﬁrst attempts
of the modern era to model speech production. The primary
goal of this work was speech synthesis, and there was no asser-
tion that the models bore any internal similarity to the physio-
logic system. Such models are often called terminal–analog
models because they are analogous to the real system only at
the terminus. Work on acoustic tube models in the 1960s (Fant,
1960) represents an attempt to model the internal physics of the
