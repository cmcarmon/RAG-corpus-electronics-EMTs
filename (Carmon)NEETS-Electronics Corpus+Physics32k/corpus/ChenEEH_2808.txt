The Continuous Space
When used to truncate an FDTD lattice, the PML has a
thickness d and is terminated by the outer boundary of the
lattice. If the outer boundary is assumed to be a PEC wall,
ﬁnite power reﬂects back into the primary computation zone.
For a wave impinging on the PML at angle u relative to the w-
directed surface normal, this reﬂection can be computed using
transmission line analysis, yielding:
