• Collect, read in, and store machine, transformer, and line data in per-unit on common bases.
• Formulate the sequence impedance matrices.
• Deﬁne the faulted bus and Zf. Specify type of fault to be analyzed.
• Compute the sequence voltages.
• Compute the sequence currents.
• Correct for wye-delta connections.
• Transform to phase currents and voltages.
