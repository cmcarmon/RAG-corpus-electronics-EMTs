of circuit-level and system-level techniques. In Section 8.4, we
discuss various control-ﬂow checking methods using a watch-
dog processor, and in Section 8.5, we present processor micro
rollback techniques for recovering from detected errors like
CFC errors. In Section 8.6, we describe ABFT methods for
achieving FD and/or FT at the application level. We conclude
in Section 8.7 with a summary of our ﬁndings.
