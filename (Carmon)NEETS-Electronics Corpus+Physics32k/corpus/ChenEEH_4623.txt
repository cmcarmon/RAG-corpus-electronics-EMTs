In the classical approach to gain scheduling, the nonlinear
plant is linearized about a set of operating conditions or
equilibrium points. For each linearized plant, a linear control-
ler is derived to satisfy applicable performance requirements,
such as disturbance rejection or transient response speciÔ¨Åca-
tions. The gain-scheduled controller is formed by interpo-
lating, or scheduling, among the set of linear control laws.
