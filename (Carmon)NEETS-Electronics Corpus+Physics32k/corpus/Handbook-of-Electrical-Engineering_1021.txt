Obtaining realistic skew parameter values, taking into account all the subtle correlations between parameters,
is more difﬁcult. In fact, skew model generation is often more an art than a science. Many attempts have been
made to utilize techniques from a branch of statistics called multivariate analysis [Dillon and Goldstein, 1984].
In this approach principal component or factor analysis is used to ﬁnd parameters that are linear combinations
of the original parameters. Only the ﬁrst few of these new parameters will be kept; the others will be discarded
because they have less signiﬁcance. This new set will have fewer parameters than the original set and therefore
will be more manageable in terms of ﬁnding their skews. The user sometimes must make many choices in the
way the common factors are utilized, resulting in different users obtaining different results.
