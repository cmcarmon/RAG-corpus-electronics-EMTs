Strong-Inversion Characteristics
In Fig. 24.44 the source-drain current ID is plotted versus drain-to-source voltage VD (the I-V curves for the
MOSFET). At low VD the current increases approximately linearly with increased VD , behaving like a simple
resistor with a resistance that is controlled by the gate voltage VG: as the gate voltage is made more attractive
for channel carriers, the channel becomes stronger, more carriers are contained in the channel, and its resistance
Rch drops. Hence, at larger VG the current is larger.
