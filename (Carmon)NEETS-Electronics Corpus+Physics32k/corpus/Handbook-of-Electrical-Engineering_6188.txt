Superheterodyne receiver: Most receivers employ the superheterodyne receiving technique, which consists
of either down-converting or up-converting the input signal to some convenient frequency band, called
the  intermediate  frequency  band,  and  then  extracting  the  information  (or  modulation)  by  using  an
appropriate detector. This basic receiver structure is used for the reception of all types of bandpass signals,
such as television, FM, AM, satellite, and radar signals.
