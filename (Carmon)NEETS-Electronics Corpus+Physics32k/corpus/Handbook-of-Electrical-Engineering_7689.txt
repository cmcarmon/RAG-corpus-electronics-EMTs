NVRAM is a term used to describe a SRAM or DRAM with nonvolatile circuit elements. The cell is built to
operate as a RAM with normal power applied. On command or with power failure imminent, the EEPROM
elements can be activated to capture the last state of the RAM cell. The nonvolatile information is restored to
a SRAM cell by normal internal cell regeneration when power is restored.
