To make matters worse, if you’re handling high AC voltages (which you 
shouldn’t be), your skin’s resistance — wet or dry — won’t help you at 
all. When you’re in contact with a metal, your body and the metal form a 
 capacitor: The tissue underneath your skin is one plate, the metal is the 
other plate, and your skin is the dielectric. (See Chapter 7 for the lowdown 
on capacitors.) If that metal wire you’re holding is carrying an AC current, 
the capacitor that is your body acts like a short circuit, allowing current to 
bypass your skin’s resistance. Voltage shocks of more than 240 volts will 
burn right through your skin, leaving deep third‐degree burns at the entry 
points.
