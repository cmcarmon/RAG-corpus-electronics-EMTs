Transformers may be classiﬁed by their frequency range: power transformers, which usually
operate at a ﬁxed frequency; audio and ultrahigh-frequency transformers; wide-band and narrow-
band frequency transformers; and pulse transformers. Transformers employed in supplying power
to electronic systems are generally known as power transformers. In power-system applications,
however, the term power transformer denotes transformers used to transmit power in ratings
larger than those associated with distribution transformers, usually more than 500 kVA at voltage
levels of 67 kV and above.
