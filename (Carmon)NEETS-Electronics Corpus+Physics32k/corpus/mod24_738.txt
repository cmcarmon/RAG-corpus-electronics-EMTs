An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a photodiode that internally amplifies the photocurrent by an
avalanche process. Figure 7-4 shows an example APD structure. In APDs, a large reverse-bias voltage,
typically over 100 volts, is applied across the active region. This voltage causes the electrons initially
generated by the incident photons to accelerate as they move through the APD active region. As these
electrons collide with other electrons in the semiconductor material, they cause a fraction of them to
become part of the photocurrent. This process is known as avalanche multiplication. Avalanche
multiplication continues to occur until the electrons move out of the active area of the APD.
