After  the  appropriate  low-pass  form  of  a  given  ﬁlter  has  been  synthesized,  the  designer  must  address  the
realization  of  the  ﬁlter  using  operational  ampliﬁers.  If  the  required  ﬁlter  is  not  low-pass  but  high-pass,
bandpass, or bandstop, transformation of the prototype function is also required [Budak, 1974; Van Valkenburg,
1982]. While a detailed treatment of the various transformations is beyond the scope of this work, most of the
ﬁlter designs encountered in practice can be accomplished using the techniques given here.
