A reservoir is a thermodynamic system which controls the state of a system, usually by "imposing" itself upon the system being controlled. This means that the nature of its contact with the system can be controlled. A reservoir is so large that its thermodynamic state is not appreciably affected by the state of the system being controlled. The term "atmospheric pressure" in the below description of a theoretical thermometer is essentially a "pressure reservoir" which imposes atmospheric pressure upon the thermometer.
Some common reservoirs are:
Pressure reservoir - by far the most common pressure reservoir is the Earth's atmosphere.
Temperature reservoir - A large quantity of water at its triple point forms an effective temperature reservoir.
