manner. The polarities of these definitions can be arbitrary from
one branch to the next. However, for any given branch, follow the
associated variables convention (see Section 1.5.3 in Chapter 1). In other
words, the branch current should be defined as positive into the positive
voltage terminal of the branch. By following the associated variables,
element laws can be applied consistently, and the solutions will follow
a much clearer pattern.
