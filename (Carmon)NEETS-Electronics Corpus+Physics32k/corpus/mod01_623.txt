In actual practice the wired circuits and more complex schematics are rarely laid out in this simple
form. For this reason, it is important for you to recognize that circuits can be drawn in a variety of ways,
and to learn some of the techniques for redrawing them into their simplified form. When a circuit is
redrawn for clarity or to its simplest form, the following steps are used.
