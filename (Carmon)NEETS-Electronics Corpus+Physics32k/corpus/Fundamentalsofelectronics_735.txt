This chapter develops a common theory that underlies how such systems work. We describe and analyze
several such systems, some old like AM radio, some new like computer networks. The question as to which is
better, analog or digital communication, has been answered, because of Claude Shannon’s fundamental work
on a theory of information published in 1948, the development of cheap, high-performance computers, and
the creation of high-bandwidth communication systems. The answer is to use a digital communication
strategy. In most cases, you should convert all information-bearing signals into discrete-time, amplitude-
quantized signals. Fundamentally digital signals, like computer ﬁles (which are a special case of symbolic
signals), are in the proper form. Because of the Sampling Theorem, we know how to convert analog signals
into digital ones. Shannon showed that once in this form, a properly engineered system can communi-
cate digital information with no error despite the fact that the communication channel thrusts
noise onto all transmissions. This startling result has no counterpart in analog systems; AM radio
will remain noisy. The convergence of these theoretical and engineering results on communications systems
has had important consequences in other arenas. The audio compact disc (CD) and the digital videodisk
(DVD) are now considered digital communications systems, with communication design considerations used
throughout.
