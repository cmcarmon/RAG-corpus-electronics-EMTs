The artificial transmission line is effectively an open circuit at its output end. Therefore, when the
voltage wave reaches the output end of the line, it is reflected. As the reflected wave propagates from the
output end back toward the input end of the line, it completely discharges each section of the line. When
the reflected wave reaches the input end of the line, the line is completely discharged, and the modulator
pulse ceases abruptly. If the oscillator and pulse transformer circuit impedance is properly matched to the
line impedance, the voltage pulse that appears across the transformer primary equals one-half the voltage
to which the line was initially charged.
