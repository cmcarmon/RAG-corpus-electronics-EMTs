Figure 14.12 that Q is the ratio of the peak height of the curve to the height
of the intersection point of the asymptotes. Thus, Q is an indication of the
‘‘peakiness’’ of the frequency response curve. Several magnitude and phase
plots illustrating the relationship between the peakiness and Q are shown in
Figures 14.13 and 14.14.
