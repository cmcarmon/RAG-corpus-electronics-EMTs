The electronic switch alternates between opening and closing approximately 10,000 times
per second. Energy is delivered by the battery over a period of several seconds and stored in the
capacitor. The stored energy is extracted from the capacitor whenever needed. The battery source
causes the current in the inductor to build up while the electronic switch is closed. Recall that the
current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously. When the switch opens, the inductor forces
current to go through the diode in one direction, charging the capacitor. Thus the diode allows the
capacitor to be charged whenever the electronic switch is open, and prevents the ﬂow in the other
direction when the electronic switch is closed. The voltage on the capacitor eventually reaches
several hundred volts. When the camera shutter is opened, another switch is closed, enabling
the capacitor to discharge through the ﬂash tube. Nowadays several practical electronic circuits
employ diodes, BJTs, FETs, and integrated circuits.
