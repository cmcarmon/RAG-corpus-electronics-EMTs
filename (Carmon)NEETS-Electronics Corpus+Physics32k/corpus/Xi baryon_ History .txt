The Ξ−b particle is also known as the cascade B particle and contains quarks from all three families. It was discovered by D0 and CDF experiments at Fermilab. The discovery was announced on 12 June 2007. It was the first known particle made of quarks from all three quark generations – namely, a down quark, a strange quark, and a bottom quark. The D0 and CDF collaborations reported the consistent masses of the new state. The Particle Data Group world average mass is 5.7924±0.0030 GeV/c2.
Unless specified, the non-up/down quark content of Xi baryons is strange (i.e. there is one up or down quark and two strange quarks). However a Ξ0b contains one up, one strange, and one bottom quark, while a Ξ0bb contains one up and two bottom quarks.
In 2012, the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider detected a Ξ∗0b baryon (reported mass 5945±2.8 MeV/c2). The LHCb experiment at CERN discovered two new Xi baryons in 2014: Ξ′−b and Ξ∗−b .
In 2017, the LHCb researchers reported yet another Xi baryon: the double charmed Ξ++cc baryon, consisting of two heavy charm quarks and one up quark. The mass of Ξ++cc is about 3.8 times that of a proton.
