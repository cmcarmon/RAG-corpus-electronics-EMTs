The partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture. It is useful in gas mixtures, e.g. air, to focus on one particular gas component, e.g. oxygen.
It can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:

{\displaystyle V_{x}=V_{tot}\times {\frac {p_{x}}{p_{tot}}}=V_{tot}\times {\frac {n_{x}}{n_{tot}}}}

Vx is the partial volume of an individual gas component X in the mixture
Vtot is the total volume of the gas mixture
px is the partial pressure of gas X
ptot is the total pressure of the gas mixture
nx is the amount of substance of gas X
ntot is the total amount of substance in the gas mixture
