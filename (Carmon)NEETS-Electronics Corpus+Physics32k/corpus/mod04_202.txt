Single lace can be started with a square knot and at least two marling hitches drawn tightly. Details 
of the square knot and marling hitch are shown in figure 2-41. Do not confuse the marling hitch with a 
half hitch. In the marling hitch, the end is passed over and under the strand, as shown in view A of the 
figure. After forming the marling hitches, draw them tightly against the square knot, as shown in view B. 
The lace consists of a series of marling hitches evenly spaced at 1/2-inch to 1-inch intervals along the 
length of the group of conductors, as shown in view C of the figure.
