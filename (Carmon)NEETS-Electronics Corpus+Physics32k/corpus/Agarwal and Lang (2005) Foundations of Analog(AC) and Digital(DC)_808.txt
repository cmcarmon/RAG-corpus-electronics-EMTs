Next, consider the lightbulb circuit with a pair of switches connected in series
as depicted in Figure 6.6a. The lightbulb can be turned on only by closing
both the switches A and B. Similarly, Figure 6.6b shows a circuit with a pair
of switches connected in an OR configuration. In the latter configuration, the
bulb can be turned on by closing either switch A or switch B.
