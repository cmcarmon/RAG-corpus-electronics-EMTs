Speech Quality and Intelligibility
To compare the performance of two speech coders, it is necessary to have some indicator of the intelligibility
 usually refers to whether the output
and quality of the speech produced by each coder. The term 
 is an indicator of how natural the speech sounds. It is
speech is easily understandable, while the term 
possible for a coder to produce highly intelligible speech that is low quality in that the speech may sound very
machine-like  and  the  speaker  is  not  identiﬁable.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  unlikely  that  unintelligible  speech
would be called high quality, but there are situations in which perceptually pleasing speech does not have high
intelligibility. We brieﬂy discuss here the most common measures of intelligibility and quality used in formal
tests of speech coders.
