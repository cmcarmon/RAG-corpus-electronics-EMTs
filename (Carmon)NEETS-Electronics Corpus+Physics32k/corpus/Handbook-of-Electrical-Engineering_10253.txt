In each cabinet the line replaceable modules (LRMs) are interconnected by dual ARINC 659 backplane data
buses. The cabinets are connected to the quadraplex (not shown) or triplex redundant ARINC 629 system and
ﬂy-by-wire data buses and are also connected via the system buses to the three multifunction control display
units (MCDU) used by ﬂight crew and maintenance personnel to interact with AIMS. The cabinets transmit
merged and processed data over quadruple redundant custom designed 100 Mhz buses to the EFIS and EICAS
displays.
