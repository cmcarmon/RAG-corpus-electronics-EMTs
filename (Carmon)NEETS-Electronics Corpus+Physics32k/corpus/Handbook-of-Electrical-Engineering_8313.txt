Design for Testability
Low-cost/high-volume manufacturing requires that product testability be considered up front since a product
which is inherently hard to test will cost both time and money to achieve a desired level of quality. There are
many steps that can be taken to improve the testability of digital circuits and systems. The following subsections
describe some of the techniques that can be used.
