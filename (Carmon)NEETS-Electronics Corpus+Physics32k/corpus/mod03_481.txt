The schematic of the wafer is always drawn to represent the wafer as it would look if viewed from
opposite the operating handle or mechanism. If the wafer has contacts on both sides, two drawings are
used to show the two sides of the wafer. The two drawings are labeled "front" and "rear." The drawing
labeled "front" represents the side of the wafer closest to the operating mechanism.
