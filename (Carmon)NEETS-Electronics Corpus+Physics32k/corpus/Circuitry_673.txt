Transistor current gain (hFE) measurement 
 
Many  modern  digital  multi-range  meters  also 
provide  some  (fairly  basic)  facilities  for  checking 
transistors. Figure 14.22 shows how to measure the 
current  gain  (hFE) of  an  NPN  transistor  (see  page 
142).  The  transistor  is  inserted  into  the  three-way 
connector marked ‘EBC’, taking care to ensure that 
the emitter lead is connected to ‘E’, the base lead to 
‘B’, and the collector lead to ‘C’. The mode switch 
and  range  selector  controls  are  set  to  DC,  NPN 
respectively.  The  display  indication  in  Fig.  14.22 
shows that the device has a current gain of 93. This 
means that, for the device in question, the ratio of 
collector current (IC) to base current (IB) is 93.
