On the receive side, the tone converter accepts the mark and space tones coming in from a receiver 
and converts them into signals suitable to operate a relay in the converter. The make and break contacts of 
the relay are connected in the local tty dc loop circuit. This causes the teletypewriter to print in unison 
with the mark and space signals from the distant tty.
