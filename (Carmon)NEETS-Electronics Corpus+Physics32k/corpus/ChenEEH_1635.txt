JPEG: Digital Compression and Coding of
Continuous-Tone Still Images
The Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard is
used for compression of continuous-tone still images (ISO
10918-1, 1994). This compression standard is based on the
Huffman and run-length encoding of the quantized DCT
coefﬁcients of image blocks. The widespread use of the JPEG
standard is motivated by the fact that it consistently produces
compression ratios in excess of 20:1. The compression algo-
rithm can be operated on both gray scale as well as multichan-
nel color
in psychovisually
redundant RGB format, is ﬁrst converted to a more ‘‘compres-
sion-friendly’’ color model like YCbCr or YUV. The image is
ﬁrst broken down into blocks of size 8  8 called data units.
After that, depending on color model and decimation scheme
for chrominance channels involved, minimum code units
(MCUs) are formed. A minimum code unit is the smallest
unit that is processed for DCT, quantization, and variable-
length encoding subsequently. One example for the case of
the YUV 4:1:1 color model (each of chrominance component
being half in width and half in length) is shown in Figure 6.1.
Here the MCU consists of four data units from the Y compon-
ent and one each from the U and V components.
