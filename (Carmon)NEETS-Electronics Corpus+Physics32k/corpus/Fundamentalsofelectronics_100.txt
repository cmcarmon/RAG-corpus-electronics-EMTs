Solutions to Exercises in Chapter 2
Solution to Exercise 2.1 (p. 12)
z + z∗ = a + jb + a − jb = 2a = 2Re [z]. Similarly, z − z∗ = a + jb − (a − jb) = 2jb = 2jIm [z]
Solution to Exercise 2.2 (p. 12)
To convert 3 − 2j to polar form, we ﬁrst locate the number in the complex plane in the fourth quadrant.
√
32 + (−2)2.
The distance from the origin to the complex number is the magnitude r, which equals
√
13 =
13∠ (−33.7) degrees.
