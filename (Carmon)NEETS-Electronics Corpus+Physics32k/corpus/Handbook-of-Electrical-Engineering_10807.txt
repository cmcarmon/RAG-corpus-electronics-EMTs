The focus is on the design stage because, for many articles, that is where most, if not all, of their life cycle
environmental impacts are explicitly or implicitly established. Traditionally, electronics design has been based
on a correct-by-veriﬁcation approach, in which the environmental ramiﬁcations of a product (from manufac-
turing through disposition) are not considered until the product design is completed. DFE, by contrast, takes
place  early  in  a  product’s  design  phase  as  part  of  the  concurrent  engineering  process  to  ensure  that  the
environmental consequences of a product’s life cycle are understood before manufacturing decisions are committed.
It is estimated that some 80 to 90% of the environmental impacts generated by product manufacture, use,
and  disposal  are “locked-in”  by  the  initial  design.  Materials  choices,  for  example,  ripple  backwards  towards
environmental impacts associated with the extractive, smelting, and chemical industries. The design of a product
and component selection control many environmental impacts associated with manufacturing, enabling, for
example, substitution of no-clean or aqueous cleaning of printed wiring boards for processes that release ozone
depleting substances, air toxics, or volatile organic compounds that are precursors of photochemical smog. The
design of products controls many aspects of environmental impacts during use—energy efﬁcient design is one
example. Product design also controls the ease with which a product may be refurbished, or disassembled for
parts or materials reclamation, after consumer use. DFE tools and methodologies offer a means to address such
concerns at the design stage.
