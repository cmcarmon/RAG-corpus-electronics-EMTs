First, observe that pieces M1, M2, and M6 must have the same resistance of 2 k because
they are squares (in Equation 1.9, notice that L/W = 1 for a square).
Second, M3 and M7 must have the same resistance because both have the same ratio
L/W = 3. Therefore, both have a resistance of 3 Ã— 2 = 6 k. Among them, M4 has
the biggest L/W ratio of 12. Therefore it has the largest resistance of 24 k. M5 has the
smallest L/W ratio of 1/3, and accordingly has the smallest resistance of 2/3 k.
