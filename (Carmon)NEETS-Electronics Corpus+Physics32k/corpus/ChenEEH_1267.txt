. Extended data output (EDO) DRAM is the leading type
of DRAM used in mid-1990s. It is faster than FPM
DRAM because it allows the CPU to access data while
the refresh cycle is being set up. The typical access time
for EDO DRAM is 60 ns. As the CPU speed increases
beyond 200 MHz, however,
the popularity of EDO
DRAM gives way to the faster SDRAM.
