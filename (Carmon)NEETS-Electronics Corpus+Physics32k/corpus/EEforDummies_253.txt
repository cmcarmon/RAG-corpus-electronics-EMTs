Too much current can destroy many sensitive electronic components — 
such as transistors (which I discuss in Chapter 10) and integrated circuits 
(which I discuss in Chapter 11). By putting a resistor at the input to a sensi­
tive part, you limit the current that reaches the part. (But if you use too high 
a resistance, say 1 MΩ, which is 1,000,000 ohms, you’ll limit the current so 
much you won’t see the light, although it’s there!) This simple technique can 
save you a lot of time and money that you would otherwise lose fixing acci­
dental blow‐ups of your circuits.
