Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials are lossy. This will distort the shape of the hysteresis loop and can
even lead to incorrect identiﬁcation of materials as ferroelectric when they merely have nonlinear conduction
characteristics.  A  resistive  component  (from  Rd  in  Fig. 49.3)  will  introduce  a  phase  shift  in  the  polarization
signal.  Thus  the  display  has  an  elliptical  component,  which  looks  like  the  beginnings  of  the  opening  of  a
hysteresis loop. However, if the horizontal signal has the same phase shift, the inﬂuence of this lossy component
is eliminated, because it is in effect subtracted. Obtaining the exact match is the function of the optional phase
shifter, and in the original circuits a bridge was constructed which had a second measuring capacitor in the
comparison arm (identical to the one in series with the sample). The phase was then matched with adjustable
high-voltage components which match Co and Rd.
