For a given voltage, the current through coil A is practically constant. However, the current through
coil B varies with the frequency. At a higher frequency the inductive reactance is greater and the current
through coil B is less; the reverse is true at a lower frequency. The disk turns in the direction determined
by the stronger coil.
