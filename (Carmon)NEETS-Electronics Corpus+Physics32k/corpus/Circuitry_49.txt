Magnetic fields 
 
The  field  surrounding  a  straight  current-carrying 
conductor is shown in Fig. 1.11. The magnetic field 
defines the direction of motion of a free North pole 
within the field. In the case of Fig. 1.11, the lines of 
flux  are  concentric  and  the  direction  of  the  field 
determined  by  the  direction  of  current  flow)  is 
given by the right-hand rule.
