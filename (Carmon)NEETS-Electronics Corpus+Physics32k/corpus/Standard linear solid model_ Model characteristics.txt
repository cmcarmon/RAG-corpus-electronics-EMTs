The standard linear solid model combines aspects of the Maxwell and Kelvinâ€“Voigt models to accurately describe the overall behavior of a system under a given set of loading conditions. The behavior of a material applied to an instantaneous stress is shown as having an instantaneous component of the response. Instantaneous release of a stress also results in a discontinuous decrease in strain, as is expected. The shape of the time-dependent strain curve is true to the type of equation that characterizes the behavior of the model over time, depending upon how the model is loaded.
Although this model can be used to accurately predict the general shape of the strain curve, as well as behavior for long time and instantaneous loads, the model lacks the ability to accurately model material systems numerically.
