occurring when the aperture dimensions are A ∼=
√
3λL and B ∼= 0.81A. The principal-plane beam-
widths for the optimum horn with maximum gain
∼= 54λ/B in degrees in the yz-
are given by θB
∼= 78λ/A in degrees in the xz-
plane, and by φB
plane. For a pyramidal horn, with A = 6λ and B
= 4.86λ, at 6 GHz, ﬁnd GD, θ B, and φB. Comment
on whether this horn is optimum.
