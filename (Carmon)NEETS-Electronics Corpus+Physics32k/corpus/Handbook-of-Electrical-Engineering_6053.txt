An  operator  training  simulator  (OTS)  can  be  used  in  an  investigatory  manner  to  recreate  past  actual
operational  scenarios  and  to  formulate  system  restoration  procedures.  Scenarios  can  be  created,  saved,  and
reused. The OTS can be used to evaluate the functionality and performance of new real-time EMS functions
and also for tuning AGC in an off-line, secure environment.
