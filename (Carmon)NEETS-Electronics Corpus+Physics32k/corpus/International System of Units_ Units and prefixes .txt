The International System of Units consists of a set of base units, a set of coherent derived units, and a set of decimal-based multipliers that are used as prefixes. Coherent units are derived units that contain no numerical factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions. For example: 1 N = 1 kg × 1 m/s2 which says that one newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram at one metre per second squared. Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kilogram and metre per second squared respectively and F ∝ m × a, the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give 1 kg⋅m⋅s−2. Since the newton is part of a coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.
While the base and specified derived units are coherent, they are not all independent: for example, siemens can be specified in terms of ohms as its inverse. Ohms and siemens can be replaced with a combination of amperes and volts, because those quantities bear a defined relationship to each other. Other useful derived quantities can be specified in terms of the SI base and derived units that have no named units in the SI system, such as acceleration, which is defined in SI units as m/s2.
