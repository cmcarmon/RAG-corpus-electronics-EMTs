Ultimately,  it  is  the  electrical  equipment  being  protected  that  dictates  the  type  of  fuse  needed  for  proper
protection. This equipment is forever changing and tends to get smaller as new technology becomes available.
Present trends indicate that fuses also must become smaller and faster under fault conditions, particularly as
available short-circuit fault currents are tending to increase.
