Zero impedance at resonance allows maximum current. All other frequencies have a reduced current 
because of the increased impedance. The voltage across the reactance is greatest at resonance because 
voltage drop is directly proportional to current. All discrimination between frequencies results from the 
fact that XL and XC completely counteract ONLY at the resonant frequency.
