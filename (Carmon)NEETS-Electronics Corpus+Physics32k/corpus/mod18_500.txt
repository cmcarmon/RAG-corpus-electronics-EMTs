Power is used by any equipment that requires electrical power for its operation (lights, motors, 
director power drives, radar equipment, weapon direction equipment, computers, etc.). The maintenance 
of the ship service generators, the emergency generators, and distribution switchboards is the 
responsibility of the ship's engineers (machinist's mates, electrician's mates, enginemen, etc.).
