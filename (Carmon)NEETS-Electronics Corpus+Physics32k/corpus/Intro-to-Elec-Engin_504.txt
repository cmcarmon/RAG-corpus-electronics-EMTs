Addition of binary numbers is so common that a binary half-adder and a full-adder (FA)
have become building blocks in their own right, and are available in IC form. The representation
of the half-adder, which can add single-digit binary numbers, is shown in Figure 6.1.10(a) along
with its truth table. N full adders are needed to add together two N-digit binary numbers. Figure
6.1.11 illustrates the addition of 4-digit binary numbers.
