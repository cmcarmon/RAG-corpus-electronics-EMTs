A half subtractor can handle only two 1-bit num-
bers. To subtract binary numbers with more than 1Â bit, 
additional full subtractors must be used. Keep in mind 
that if a 1 is subtracted from a 0, a borrow must be 
made from the next higher-order column. The out-
put borrow of the lower-order subtractor becomes the 
 input borrow of the next higher-order subtractor.
