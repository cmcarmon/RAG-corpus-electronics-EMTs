Moment of inertia I is defined as the ratio of the net angular momentum L of a system to its angular velocity ω around a principal axis, that is




I
=


L
ω


.


{\displaystyle I={\frac {L}{\omega }}.}

If the angular momentum of a system is constant, then as the moment of inertia gets smaller, the angular velocity must increase. This occurs when spinning figure skaters pull in their outstretched arms or divers curl their bodies into a tuck position during a dive, to spin faster.
If the shape of the body does not change, then its moment of inertia appears in Newton's law of motion as the ratio of an applied torque τ on a body to the angular acceleration α around a principal axis, that is




τ
=
I
α
.


{\displaystyle \tau =I\alpha .}

For a simple pendulum, this definition yields a formula for the moment of inertia I in terms of the mass m of the pendulum and its distance r from the pivot point as,




I
=
m

r

.


{\displaystyle I=mr^{2}.}

Thus, moment of inertia depends on both the mass m of a body and its geometry, or shape, as defined by the distance r to the axis of rotation.
This simple formula generalizes to define moment of inertia for an arbitrarily shaped body as the sum of all the elemental point masses dm each multiplied by the square of its perpendicular distance r to an axis k̂.
In general, given an object of mass m, an effective radius k can be defined for an axis through its center of mass, with such a value that its moment of inertia is




I
=
m

,


{\displaystyle I=mk^{2},}

where k is known as the radius of gyration.
