Shot noise is noise caused by current fluctuations because of the discrete nature of charge carriers.
Dark current and quantum noises are two types of noise that manifest themselves as shot noise. Dark
current noise results from dark current that continues to flow in the photodiode when there is no incident
light. Dark current noise is independent of the optical signal. In addition, the discrete nature of the
photodetection process creates a signal dependent shot noise called quantum noise. Quantum noise
results from the random generation of electrons by the incident optical radiation. In APDs, the random
nature of the avalanche process introduces an additional shot noise called excess noise. For further
information on the excess noise resulting from the avalanche process, refer to the avalanche photodiode
section.
