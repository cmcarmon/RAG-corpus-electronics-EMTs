Computer Relaying
Relaying with computers began to be discussed in technical literature in the mid-1960s. Initially, this was an
academic exercise, as neither the computer speeds nor the computer costs could justify the use of computers
for relaying. However, with the advent of high-performance microprocessors, computer relaying has become
a  very  practical  and  attractive  ﬁeld  of  research  and  development. All  major  manufacturers  of  electric  power
equipment have computer relays to meet all the needs of power system engineers. Computer relaying is also
being  taught  in  several  universities  and  has  provided  a  very  fertile  ﬁeld  of  research  for  graduate  students.
