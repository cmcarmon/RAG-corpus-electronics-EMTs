The cache often comprises two conventional memories: the data memory and the tag memory, shown in
Fig. 88.3. The address of each cache line contained in the data memory is stored in the tag memory, as well as
  information),  particularly  the  fact  that  a  valid  cache  line  is  present.  The  state  also
other  information  (
keeps track of which cache lines the processor has modiÔ¨Åed. Each line contained in the data memory is allocated
a corresponding entry in the tag memory to indicate the full address of the cache line.
