During the first half cycle (indicated by the solid arrows), the anode of D1 is positive with respect to 
ground and the anode of D2 is negative. As shown, current flows from ground (center tap), up through the 
load resistor (RL), through diode D1 to point A. In the transformer, current flows from point A, through
