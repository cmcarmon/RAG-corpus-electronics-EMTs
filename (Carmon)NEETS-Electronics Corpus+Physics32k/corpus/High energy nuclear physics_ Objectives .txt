There are several scientific objectives of this international research program:
The formation and investigation of a new state of matter made of quarks and gluons, the quark gluon plasma QGP which prevailed in early Universe in first 30 micro seconds;
The study of color confinement and the transformation of color confining = quark confining vacuum state to the excited state physicists call perturbative vacuum, in which quarks and gluons can roam free which occurs at Hagedorn temperature;
The study the origins of hadron (proton, neutron etc.) matter mass believed to be related to the phenomenon of quark confinement and vacuum structure.
