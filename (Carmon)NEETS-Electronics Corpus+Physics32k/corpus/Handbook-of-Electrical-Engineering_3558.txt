Placement transforms a logical hierarchy into a physical hierarchy by deÔ¨Åning how hardware elements are
oriented and arranged relative to each other. Placement determines the overall size, i.e., area, a digital system
. Mincut placement tech-

niques group highly connected cells into clusters. Then, the clusters are sorted and arranged according to user-
supplied priorities. Simulated annealing conducts a series of trial-and-error experiments by pseudorandomly
moving cells and evaluating the resulting placements, again according to user-supplied priorities.
