For their contributions to the creation of the transistor, Dr. Shockley,
Dr.  Bardeen,  and  Dr.  Brattain  received,  in  1956,  the  Nobel  Prize  in
physics.  It  should  be  noted  that  Dr.  Bardeen  is  the  only  individual  to
win  two  Nobel  prizes  in  physics;  the  second  came  later  for  work  in
superconductivity at the University of Illinois.
