Figure  6.6  shows  a  considerable  improvement  to 
the circuit of Fig. 6.3. The capacitor, C1, has been 
added to ensure that the output voltage remains at, 
or near, the peak voltage even when the diode is not 
conducting.  When  the  primary  voltage  is  first 
applied  to  T1,  the  first  positive  half-cycle  output 
from  the  secondary  will  charge  C1 to  the  peak 
value seen across RL. Hence C1 charges to 16.3 V 
at  the  peak  of  the  positive  half-cycle.  Because  C1
and RL are in parallel, the voltage across RL will be 
the same as that across C1. 
  The  time  required  for  C1 to  charge  to  the 
maximum  (peak) 
the 
charging circuit time constant (the series resistance 
multiplied by the capacitance value). In this circuit, 
the  secondary 
the  series  resistance  comprises 
winding  resistance 
the  forward 
resistance of the diode and the (minimal) resistance 
of  the  wiring  and  connections.  Hence  C1 charges 
very rapidly as soon as D1 starts to conduct.  
  The  time  required  for  C1 to  discharge  is,  in 
contrast,  very  much  greater.  The  discharge  time 
constant is determined by the capacitance value and 
the load resistance, RL. In practice, RL is very much 
larger  than  the  resistance  of  the  secondary  circuit
