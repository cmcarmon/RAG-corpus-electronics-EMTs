11.4.14 A single-phase, 3-kVA, 220:110-V, 60-Hz trans-
former has a high-voltage winding resistance of
0.3 , a low-voltage winding resistance of 0.06
, a leakage reactance of 0.8  on its high-
voltage side, and a leakage reactance of 0.2 
on its low-voltage side. The core loss at rated
voltage is 45 W, and the copper loss at rated
load is 100 W. Neglect the exciting current of the
transformer. Find the per-unit voltage regulation
when the transformer is supplying full load at 110
V and 0.9 lagging power factor.
