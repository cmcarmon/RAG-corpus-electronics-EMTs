In the International System of Units, heat capacity has the unit joules per Kelvin (J/K). The heat capacity (symbol C) of a system is defined as the ratio of heat transferred to or from the system and the resulting change in temperature in the system,




C
(
T
)
=



δ
Q


d
T



,


{\displaystyle C(T)={\frac {\delta Q}{dT}},}

where the symbol δ designates heat as a path function. If the temperature change is sufficiently small the heat capacity may be assumed to be constant:




C
=


Q

Δ
T



.


{\displaystyle C={\frac {Q}{\Delta T}}.}

Heat capacity is an extensive property, meaning it depends on the extent or size of the physical system studied. A sample containing twice the amount of substance as another sample requires the transfer of twice the amount of heat (
