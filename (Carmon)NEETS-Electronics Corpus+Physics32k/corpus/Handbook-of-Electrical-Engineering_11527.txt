Many  of  the  healthcare-related  provisions  of  the  electrical  code  are  based  on  two  concerns.  First,  many
patients in surgery and intensive care depend on electrical equipment for life support. Such equipment ranges
from heart-lung bypass devices to mechanical ventilators. Therefore, much attention is devoted to ensuring the
availability of electrical power in the event that the primary power distribution system fails. A hospital infor-
mation system that provides life-support functions may be subject to these provisions.
