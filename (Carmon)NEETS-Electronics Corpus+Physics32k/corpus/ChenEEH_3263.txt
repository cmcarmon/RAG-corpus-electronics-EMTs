sion system losses, are precisely matched with power gener-
ation so that the system frequency is constant (e.g., 60 Hz in
North America). Perhaps the foremost concern during steady-
state analysis is economic operation of the system; reliability is
also important as the system must be operated to avoid
outages should disturbances occur. The primary analysis tool
for steady-state operation is the so-called power ﬂow analysis,
where the voltages and power ﬂow through the system are
determined. This analysis is used for both operation and
planning studies and throughout the system at both the high
and low transmission voltages.
