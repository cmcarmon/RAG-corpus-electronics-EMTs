If the amplifier stage is transformer coupled, the turns ratio of the transformer can be selected to 
provide impedance matching. In NEETS Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and 
Transformers, you were shown the relationship between the turns ratio and the impedance ratio in a 
transformer. The relationship is expressed in the following formula:
