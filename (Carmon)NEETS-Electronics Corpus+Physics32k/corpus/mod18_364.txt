A sample of the transmitter energy is fed through the afc mixer and an IF amplifier to a
discriminator. The output of the discriminator is a dc error voltage that indicates the degree of mistuning
between the transmitter and the local oscillator. In this particular example letâ€™s assume that the IF is 30
megahertz. If the output of the mixer is correct, the discriminator will have no output. If the mixer output
is above 30 megahertz, the output of the discriminator will be positive dc pulses; if the mixer output is
below 30 megahertz, the discriminator output will be negative dc pulses. In either case, this output is fed
through an amplifier to the control circuit. The control circuit adjusts the operating frequency of the local
oscillator so that no mistuning exists and the IF is 30 megahertz. In this example the local oscillator is a
reflex klystron and the control circuit provides he repeller plate voltage for the klystron; thus, the klystron
directly controls the local oscillator frequency. In this manner the local oscillator is maintained exactly 30
megahertz below the transmitter frequency.
