The operation of the monostable multivibrator is relatively simple. The input is triggered with a 
pulse of voltage. The output changes from one voltage level to a different voltage level. The output 
remains at this new voltage level for a definite period of time. Then the circuit automatically reverts to its 
original condition and remains that way until another trigger pulse is applied to the input. The monostable 
multivibrator actually takes this series of input triggers and converts them to uniform square pulses, as 
shown in figure 3-10. All of the square output pulses are of the same amplitude and time duration.
