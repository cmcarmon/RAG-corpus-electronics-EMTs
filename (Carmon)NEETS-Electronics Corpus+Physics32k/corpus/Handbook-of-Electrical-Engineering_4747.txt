Ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials derive their properties from a combination of structural and elec-
trical  properties.  As  the  name  implies,  both  types  of  materials  have  electric  attributes.  A  large  number  of
materials  which  are  ferroelectric  are  also  piezoelectric.  However,  the  converse  is  not  true.  Pyroelectricity  is
closely related to ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties via the symmetry properties of the crystals.
