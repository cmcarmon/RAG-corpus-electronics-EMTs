Figure 9.37 also illustrates another very important point, namely that the
charge stored in, and hence the voltage appearing across, a capacitor is a con-
tinuous function of time. Even though I steps discontinuously at t = 0, v does
not; the state q, and hence v,
is continuous. The only way for v to take a
discontinuous step would be for the current source to deliver a nonzero charge
in zero time, which requires an infinite current. This is of course not a practical
possibility, although we will see that such a mathematical construction can be
used very effectively to model certain physical phenomena.
