The resistance can also be deÔ¨Åned in terms of sheet resistivity. If
the  sheet  resistivity  is  used,  a  standard  sheet  thickness  is  assumed
and  factored  into  resistivity.  Typically,  resistors  are  rectangular  in
l
 gives the number
 divided by the width 
shape; therefore the length 
of  squares  within  the  resistor  (Fig.  1.2).  The  number  of  squares
multiplied by the resistivity is the resistance.
