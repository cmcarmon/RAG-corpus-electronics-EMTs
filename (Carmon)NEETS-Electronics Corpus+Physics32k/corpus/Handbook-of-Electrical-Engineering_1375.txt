The time-varying AR model for speech signals lacks the “memory’’ which assigns preference to one AR model
to follow another AR model. This memory could be incorporated, for example, by assuming that the individual
AR models are chosen in a Markovian manner. That is, given an AR model for the current segment of speech,
certain AR models for the following segment of speech will be more likely than others. This results in the so-
called composite source model (CSM) for the speech signal.
