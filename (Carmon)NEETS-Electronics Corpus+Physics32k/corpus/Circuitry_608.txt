signal  level  increases,  the  d.c.  level  from  the 
demodulator  stage  increases  and  this  is  used  to 
reduce the gain of both the RF and IF amplifiers. 
 The  superhet  receiver’s  intermediate  frequency  
fIF, is the difference between the signal frequency,  
fRF, and  the  local  oscillator  frequency,  fLO. The 
desired local oscillator frequency can be calculated 
from the relationship: 
 
fLO = fRF ± fIF 
Note  that  in  most  cases  (and  in  order  to  simplify 
tuning  arrangements)  the  local  oscillator  operates 
above the signal frequency, i.e. fLO = fRF + fIF 
.
