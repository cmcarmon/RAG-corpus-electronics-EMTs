To advance the technology of in-ﬂight weather reporting, Langley Research Center developed in the early
1990’s a cockpit weather information system known as CWIN (Cockpit Weather Information). The system
draws  on  several  commercial  data  sensors  to  create  radar  maps  of  storms  and  lightning,  together  with
reports of surface observations.
Shown  above  is  a  CWIN
display in the simulation cock-
pit of Langley’s Transport Sys-
tems  Research  Vehicle,  a
modiﬁed  jetliner  used  to  test
advanced  technologies.  The
CWIN  display  is  the  lower
right  screen  among  the  four
center panel screens. By push-
ing  a  button,  the  pilot  may
select  from  a  menu  of  several
displays,  such  as  a  ceiling  and
visibility  map,  radar  storm
map,  or  lightning  strike  map.
