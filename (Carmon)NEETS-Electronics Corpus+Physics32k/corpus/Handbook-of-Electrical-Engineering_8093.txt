The most common direct-bandgap semiconductor is GaAs, but the photon wavelength calculated for 
E
 = 1.43 eV as listed in Fig. 83.3(b) is in the infrared. Such a material may be ideal for communications and
D
sensory  optoelectronic  applications  but  is  unsuitable  for  display  purposes.  The  bandgap  may  be  adjusted,
however, by the substitution of phosphorus for arsenic in the lattice as shown in Fig. 83.3(a). The color range
listed  corresponds  to  the  range  of  LED  colors  commonly  available:  red,  yellow,  and  green.  The  direct  and
indirect bandgaps,
