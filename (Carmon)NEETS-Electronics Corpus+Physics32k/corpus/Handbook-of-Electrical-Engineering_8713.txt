Deﬁning the semantics of a language is more difﬁcult because there is no universally accepted metalanguage
for  expressing  semantics.  Instead,  semantics  is  usually  deﬁned  by  another  program  that  translates  from  the
HLL into some machine-level language. In a way, the semantics of a certain HLL is deﬁned by writing a program
that unambiguously maps each statement of the HLL into an equivalent sequence of machine-level statements.
For  example,  the  FORTRAN  statement  below  is  converted  into  an  equivalent  machine-level  sequence  of
statements as shown to the right:
