It is also because each branch current flows into exactly one node and out from exactly
one node that summing Equations 2.5 through 2.8 yields 0 = 0. This in turn shows
that the four KCL equations are dependent. In fact, a circuit with N nodes will have
only N âˆ’ 1 independent statements of KCL. Therefore, when fully analyzing a circuit it
is both necessary and sufficient to apply KCL to all but one node.
