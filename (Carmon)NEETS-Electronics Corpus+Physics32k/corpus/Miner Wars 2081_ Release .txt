In October 2010, the pre-alpha version of Miner Wars 2081 was released to the public, with a free demo version and discounted pre-order version. Miner Wars 2081 is available for Microsoft Windows, and was later released on Xbox Live Arcade.
In October 2012, it was approved for distribution by Valve's Steam Greenlight program.
As of January 17, 2013, the Steam version was patched so that no internet connection is required for single player, but still required for multiplayer and to access the editor. Non-Steam versions however, still require an active internet connection during installation and game play. Valid keys from other vendors can be registered on minerwars.com where a Steam key can then be generated at no extra cost .
