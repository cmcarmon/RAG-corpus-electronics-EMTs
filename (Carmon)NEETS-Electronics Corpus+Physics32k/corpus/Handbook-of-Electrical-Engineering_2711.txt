cell depends on three criteria. The cell should be free, i.e., the cell must have a minimum gain among the gains
of all other free cells. A cell c has gain g if the number of interconnections between the cells of the two sets
decreases by g units when c is moved from its current set to the other. Finally, the selected set’s move should
not violate a predeﬁned balancing criterion that guarantees that the sizes of the two sets are almost equal. After
moving the selected cell from its current set to the complementary set, it is no longer free. A new partition,
which corresponds to the new instance of the two sets A and B, is created. The cost of a partition is deﬁned as
the number of interconnections between cells in the two sets of the partition. The Fiduccia–Mattheyses algo-
rithm  keeps  track  of  the  best  partition  encountered  so  far,  i.e.,  the  partition  with  the  minimum  cost.  The
algorithm will move the selected cell to the complementary set even if its gain is negative. In this case, the new
partition is worse than the previous one, but the move can eventually lead to better partitions.
