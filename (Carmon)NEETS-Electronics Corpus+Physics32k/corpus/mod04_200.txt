Lace or tie bundles tightly enough to prevent slipping, but not so tightly that the cord or tape cuts 
into or deforms the insulation. Be especially careful when lacing or tying coaxial cable. Coaxial cable is a 
conductor used primarily for radio-frequency transmission. It consists of a center conductor separated 
from an outer conductor (usually called a shield) by an insulating dielectric. The dielectric maintains a 
constant capacitance between the two conductors, which is very important in radio transmission. The 
dielectric is soft and deforms easily if tied too tightly or with the wrong type of tape.
