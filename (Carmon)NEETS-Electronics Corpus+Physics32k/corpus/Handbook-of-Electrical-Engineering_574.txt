Depending on the amplitude of the input signal, the series can be truncated at an appropriate term. Typically
only the Ô¨Årst few terms are used, which makes this technique applicable only to small input signals. For a pure
sinusoidal input [Eq. (5.2)], the distortion in the output can be estimated by substituting for x in Eq. (5.10)
and by use of trigonometric identities one can arrive at the form given by Eq. (5.3). For a series expansion that
is truncated after the cubic term
