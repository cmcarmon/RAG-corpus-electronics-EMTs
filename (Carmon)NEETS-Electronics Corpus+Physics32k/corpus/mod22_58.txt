All analog computers are special-purpose computers. They are designed to measure continuous 
electrical or physical conditions, such as current, voltage, flow, temperature, length, or pressure. They 
then convert these measurements into related mechanical or electrical quantities. The early analog 
computers were strictly mechanical or electromechanical devices. They did not operate on digits (in 
binary notation, either of the characters, 0 and 1). If digits were involved at all, they were obtained
