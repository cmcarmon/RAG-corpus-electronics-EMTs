You might wonder why the grid would make that much difference. After all, the plate has 300 volts
on it, while the grid only has 3 volts on it. Surely the plate would have a greater effect on current flow
than a grid with only one one-hundredth the attractive potential of the plate. But remember, in your study
of capacitors you discovered that opposites attract because of electrostatic lines of force, and that the
strength of electrostatic lines of force decreased with distance. In his tube, DeForest had placed the grid
very close to the cathode. Therefore, it had a greater effect on current flow from the cathode than did the
plate, which was placed at a much greater distance from the cathode. For this reason, De Forest was able
to double the current flow through the tube with only +3 volts applied to the grid.
