Signal attenuation in many channels can be offset by using ampliﬁers to boost the signal
level during transmission. However, the ampliﬁer also introduces additive noise in the process
of ampliﬁcation, thereby corrupting the signal. The additional noise must also be taken into
consideration in the design of the communication system.
