Air suspension is used in place of conventional steel springs in passenger cars, and in heavy vehicle applications such as buses and trucks. It is broadly used on semi trailers and trains (primarily passenger trains). One application was on EMD's experimental Aerotrain.
The purpose of air suspension is to provide a smooth, constant ride quality, but in some cases is used for sports suspension. Modern electronically controlled systems in automobiles and light trucks almost always feature self-leveling along with raising and lowering functions. Although traditionally called air bags or air bellows, the correct term is air spring (although these terms are also used to describe just the rubber bellows element with its end plates).
