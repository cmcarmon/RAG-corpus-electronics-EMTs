Strong correlation between topography and short-wavelength free-air gravity anomalies has been shown for both study of the gravity field of the Earth and the Moon, and it can be explained by the wide occurrence of isostasy. High correlation is expected for degree over 50 (short-wavelength anomaly) on Mars. And it could be as high as 0.9 for degrees between 70 and 85. Such correlation could be explained by flexural compensation of topographic loads. It is noted that older regions on Mars are isostatically compensated when the younger region are usually only partially compensated.
