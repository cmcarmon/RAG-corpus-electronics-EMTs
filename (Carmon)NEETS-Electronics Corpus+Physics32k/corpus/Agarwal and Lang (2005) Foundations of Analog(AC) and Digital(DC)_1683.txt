The first term in Equation 12.3 is the capacitor current, and follows from
the constitutive law for the capacitor given in Equation 9.9. The second
term in Equation 12.3 is the inductor current. Because the circuit contains
an inductor, Equation 12.3 contains a time integral. To remove this integral,
we differentiate Equation 12.3 with respect to time, and also divide by C, to
obtain
