 is then a balance between noise and distortion.
Figure 71.3 shows the noise contributions from shot noise, receiver noise, and RIN. For FM or digital systems,
the low CNR values required allow operation with small received optical powers. Receiver noise is then generally
the  limiting  factor.  Much  larger  received  powers  are  required  if AM-VSB  noise  requirements  are  to  be  met.
Although detecting more optical power helps to overcome shot and receiver noise, the ratio of signal to RIN
remains  constant.  RIN  can  be  dominant  in  high-CNR  systems,  when  the  received  power  is  large.  AM-VSB
systems require special care to minimize all sources of RIN. The dominant noise source is then shot noise, with
receiver noise and RIN combining to limit CNRs to within a few decibels of the quantum limit.
