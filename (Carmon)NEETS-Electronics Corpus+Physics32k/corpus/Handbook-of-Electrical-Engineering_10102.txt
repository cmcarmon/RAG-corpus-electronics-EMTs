Robot conﬁguration is an important consideration in the selection of a manipulator. Conﬁguration refers
to the way the manipulator links are connected at each joint. Each link will be connected to the subsequent
link by either a linear (sliding or prismatic) joint, which can be abbreviated with a P, or a revolute (or rotary)
joint, abbreviated with an R. Using this notation, a robot with three revolute joints would be abbreviated as
RRR,  while  one  with  a  rotary  joint  followed  by  two  linear  (prismatic)  joints  would  be  denoted  RPP.  Each
conﬁguration type is well suited to certain types of tasks and ill suited to others. Some conﬁgurations are more
versatile than others. In addition to the geometrical considerations, robot conﬁguration affects the structural
stiffness of the robot, which may be an important consideration. Also, conﬁguration impacts the complexity
of the forward and inverse 
, which are the mappings between the robot actuator (joint) space, and
the Cartesian position and orientation of the robot end-effector, or tool.
