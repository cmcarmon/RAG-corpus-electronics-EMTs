Multiple  access,  to  be  discussed  later,  allows  many  different  user  signals  to  utilize  the  satellite’s  resources  of
power and bandwidth without interfering with each other. Multiple access systems segregate users by frequency
division (FDMA) where each user is assigned a speciﬁc frequency channel, space-division multiple access (SDMA)
  that  is  by  reusing  the  same  frequencies  on  multiple  spatially  isolated  beams,  time-division
by 
multiple access (TDMA) where each user signal occupies an entire allocated frequency band but for only part of
the time, polarization-division (PD) where frequencies may be reused on spatially overlapping but orthogonally
polarized beams, and code-division multiple access (CDMA) where different users occupy the same frequency
band but use spread spectrum signals that contain orthogonal signaling codes [Sklar, 1988; Richharia, 1995].
