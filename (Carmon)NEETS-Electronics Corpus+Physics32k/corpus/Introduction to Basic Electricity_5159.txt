soldering is the joining of two pieces of metal with a 
solder alloy having a melting point below 800° Fahr-
enheit (427ºC). Solder used to include a combination 
of tin and lead in ranges from pure tin to pure lead 
and including all proportions in between. In elec-
trical  soldering, the alloy mix is usually 60% tin and 
40% lead (60/40) or 63% tin and 37% lead (63/37)  
(Figure  49-7). For soldering surface  mounted 
 devices, a solder is available with 62% tin, 28% lead, 
and 2% silver (62/36/2). To prevent lead poisoning, 
solder manufacturers now produce solder with a very 
low lead content or without lead.
