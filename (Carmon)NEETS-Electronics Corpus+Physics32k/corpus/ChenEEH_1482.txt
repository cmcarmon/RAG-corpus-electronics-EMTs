POSIX is the ﬁrst serious attempt to reconcile the two
ﬂavors of UNIX and was sponsored by the IEEE Standards
Board, a highly respected neutral body. The POSIX committee
produced a series of standards known as 1003.n-yyyy, where
1003 is the IEEE POSIX project, n denotes the document, and
yyyy is the year the standard was completed or last amended. It
deﬁnes a set of library procedures that every conformant UNIX
system must supply. There are actually more than 20 standards
and draft documents under the POSIX umbrella. The 1003.1–
1990 describes interfaces to operating system services at the
source-code level. It describes syntax (in the C language) and
behavior, not implementation of the interface by the operating
system. The 1003.2–1992 describes a programmable shell and
related utilities (Walli, 1995).
