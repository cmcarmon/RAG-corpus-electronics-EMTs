Rf burns are usually deep, penetrating, and third degree. They must heal 
from the inside out. If you are burned, seek medical attention. A person in an RF 
field will usually have a body temperature rise. The eyes and reproductive organs 
are especially susceptible to RF energy. Read and heed all warning signs!
