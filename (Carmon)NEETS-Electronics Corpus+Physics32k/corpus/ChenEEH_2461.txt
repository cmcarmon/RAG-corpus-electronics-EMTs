Small Slot Antenna
As an example, let us apply Babinet’s principle to a small
rectangular slot antenna, whose complementary structure is

the substitutions prescribed in the previous subsection, the
far-ﬁeld expressions
slot antenna can be
obtained from those in equations 6.134 and 6.135 for a short
dipole antenna:
