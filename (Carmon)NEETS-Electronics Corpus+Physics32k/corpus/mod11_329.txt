A second difference between the slot antenna and its complementary dipole is that the direction of 
the lines of electric and magnetic force abruptly reverse from one side of the metal sheet to the other. In 
the case of the dipole, the electric lines have the same general direction while the magnetic lines form 
continuous closed loops.
