For hf operation, the junction capacitances of the external
BC region (CjCx) and the collector–substrate region (CjS) are
required. With shrinking device dimensions, bias-independent
isolation (partially oxide) capacitances caused by the BE spacer
(CEox) as well as by the B-contacting region over the epicollec-
tor (CCox) are of increasing importance. As frequencies in-
crease, a substrate coupling resistance (rsu) and—for lightly
doped substrate material—the capacitance (Csu) that is associ-
ated with the substrate permittivity become important (Lee,
1999; Pfost, 1996). In some processes, a parasitic substrate
transistor can turn on; however, only a simple transport
model (iTS, ijSC, CdS) is usually required to indicate this un-
desired action to the designer.
