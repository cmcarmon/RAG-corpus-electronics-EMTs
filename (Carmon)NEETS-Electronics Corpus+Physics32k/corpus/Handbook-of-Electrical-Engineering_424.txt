The gain formulas of Mason and Coates are the classical ones in the theory of ﬂowgraphs. From the systems
viewpoint,  the  Mason  technique  provides  an  excellent  physical  insight  as  one  can  visualize  the  signal  ﬂow
through the subgraphs (forward paths and feedback loops) of  Gm . The graph reduction technique based on
the Mason graph enables one to obtain the gain expression using a step-by-step approach and at the same time
observe the cause-and-effect relationships in each step. However, since the Mason formula computes the ratio
of a speciﬁed output over one particular input, the principle of superposition must be used in order to obtain
the  overall  gain  of  the  system  if  more  than  one  input  is  present.  The  Coates  formula,  on  the  other  hand,
computes the output directly regardless of the number of inputs present in the system, but because of such a
direct computation of a given output, the graph reduction rules of Mason cannot be applied to a Coates graph
since the Coates graph is not based on the same cause-effect formulation of equations as Mason’s.
