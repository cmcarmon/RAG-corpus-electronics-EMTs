The iron-core voltage transformers respond well to harmonic frequencies for voltages up to 11 kV. Due to
insulation capacitance, these transformers are not recommended for much higher voltages. The conventional
capacitive  voltage  transformers  (CVTs)  are  totally  inadequate  due  to  low  frequency  resonances  between  the
capacitive divider and the output magnetic transformer; special portable capacitive dividers, without the output
transformers,  are  normally  used  for  such  measurements.  Again,  alternative  transducer  principles,  as  for  the
current transformer, are being proposed for future schemes.
