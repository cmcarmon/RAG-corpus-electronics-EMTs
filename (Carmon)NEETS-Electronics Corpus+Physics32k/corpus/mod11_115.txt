The constant-speed electrons must remain in the reflecting field space for a minimum time of 3/4 
cycle of the grid field for maximum energy transfer. The period of time the electrons remain in the 
repeller field is determined by the amount of negative repeller voltage. The reflex klystron will continue 
to oscillate if the electrons remain in the repeller field longer than 3/4 cycle (as long as the electrons 
return to the grid gap when the field is of the proper polarity to decelerate the electrons). Figure 2-11 
shows the effect of the repeller field on the electron bunch for 3/4 cycle and for 1 3/4 cycles. Although 
not shown in the figure, the constant-velocity electrons may remain in the repeller field for any number of 
cycles over the minimum 3/4 cycle. If the electrons remain in the field for longer than 3/4 cycle, the 
difference in electron transit time causes the tube performance characteristics to change. The differences 
in operating characteristics are identified by MODES OF OPERATION.
