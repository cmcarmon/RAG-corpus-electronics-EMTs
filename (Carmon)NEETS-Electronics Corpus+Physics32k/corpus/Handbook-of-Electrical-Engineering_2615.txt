Equation (24.38) indicates for uniform doping (no implant, DI = 0) that threshold occurs approximately for
fS = fTH = 2(kT/q)ln(NB/ni) ” 2fB, but for the nonuniformly doped case a larger surface potential is needed,
assuming the case of a normal implant where DI is positive, increasing the dopant density. The implant increases
the  required  surface  potential  because  the  ﬁeld  at  the  surface  is  larger,  narrowing  the  inversion  layer,  and
reducing the channel strength for fS = 2fB. Hence, a somewhat larger surface potential is needed to increase
qNinv to the point that Eq. (24.32) is satisﬁed. Equation (24.38) would not apply if a signiﬁcant fraction of the
implant  were  conﬁned  to  lie  within  the  inversion  layer  itself.  However,  no  realistic  implant  can  be  conﬁned
within a distance comparable to an inversion-layer thickness (a few tens of nanometers), so Eq. (24.38) covers
practical cases.
