Ac power has signiﬁcant practical advantages over dc power in generation, transmission,
and distribution. One major drawback of the single-phase circuit is the oscillatory nature of the
instantaneous power ﬂow p(t) as seen in Equation (3.1.36). The consequent shaft vibration and
noise in single-phase machinery are rather undesirable. A three-phase circuit, on the other hand,
under balanced conditions has constant, nonpulsating (time invariant), instantaneous power, as
seen from Equation (4.2.13); the pulsating strain on generating and load equipment is eliminated.
Also for power transmission, a balanced three-phase system delivers more watts per kilogram
of conductor than an equivalent single-phase system. For these reasons, almost all bulk electric
power generation and consumption take place in three-phase systems.
