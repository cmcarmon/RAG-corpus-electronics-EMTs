Some substances, mostly metallic ones, are far more sensitive to light than others. That is, more
electrons will be dislodged and emitted from the surface of a highly sensitive metal, with a given amount
of light, than will be emitted from a less sensitive substance. Upon losing electrons, the photosensitive
(light-sensitive) metal becomes positively charged, and an electric force is created. Voltage produced in
this manner is referred to as a PHOTOELECTRIC VOLTAGE.
