Making insulators work under contamination usually re-
volves around increasing the surface resistance in series with
the arc (P in Figure 5.5). Linearizing the voltage distribution is
also an effective method for improving the contamination
performance. The different techniques and the underlying
principle that helps achieve improvement in contamination
performance are listed in Table 5.3.
