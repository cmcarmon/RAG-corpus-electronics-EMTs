 Connect the discharging circuit shown in Fig. 3.41 
with R = 100 kF and C = 1,000 ÂµF. Leave the link 
in place for a few seconds after the supply voltage 
has  been  switched  on,  then  remove  the  link. 
Measure  and  record  the  capacitor  voltage  at  25  s 
intervals over the range 0 to 250 s from removing 
the  link.  Record  your  result  in  a  table  showing 
capacitor  voltage  against 
time.  Repeat  with  
R = 220 kF and R = 47 kF.
