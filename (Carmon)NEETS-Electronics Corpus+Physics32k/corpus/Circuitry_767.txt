Indicators  based  on  light  emitting  diodes  (LEDs) 
are  inherently  more  reliable  than  small  filament 
lamps  and  also  consume  considerably  less  power. 
They are thus ideal for providing visual status and 
warning displays. LEDs are available in a variety of 
styles  and  colours  and  ‘high  brightness’  types  can 
be  employed  where  high-intensity  displays  are 
required.
