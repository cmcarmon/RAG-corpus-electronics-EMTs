If your circuit calls for a resistor with a somewhat higher power rating, say  
1 W, but you have only 1/2 W resistors on hand, you can combine two 1/2 W  
resistors in parallel instead. Just select resistor values that combine to 
create the resistance you need. Because each one draws half the current that 
a single resistor would draw, it dissipates half the power (remember that 
power = voltage Ã— current).
