If we wish to take the difference between two signals, then the circuit of
Figure 15.18 is appropriate. Direct application of superposition to the inde-
pendent sources yields the two subcircuits shown in Figures 15.18b and 15.18c.
+ (cid:1) 0,
In Figure 15.18b, source v2 has been set to zero. On the assumption of i
+ (cid:1) 0, and the topology is
there will be no current through R3 and R4, so v
seen to be that of an inverting amplifier. Hence
