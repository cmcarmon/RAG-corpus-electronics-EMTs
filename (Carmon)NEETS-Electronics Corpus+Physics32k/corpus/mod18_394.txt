Signals received from each transmitted pulse are delayed for a period of time exactly equal to the
pulse-repetition time. The delayed signals are then combined with the signals received from the next
transmitted pulse. This is accomplished in such a manner that the amplitudes subtract from each other as
shown in figure 2-30, views Aand B. Since the fixed targets have approximately the same amplitude on
each successive pulse, they will be eliminated. The moving target signals, however, are of different
amplitudes on each successive pulse and, therefore, do not cancel. The resulting signal is then amplified
and presented on the indicators.
