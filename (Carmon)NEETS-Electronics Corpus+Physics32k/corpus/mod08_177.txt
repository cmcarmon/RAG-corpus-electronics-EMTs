You should notice on the figure that the frequency-response curve shows output voltage (or current)
against frequency. The lower and upper frequency limits (f1 and f2) are also known as HALF-POWER
POINTS. The half-power points are the points at which the output voltage (or current) is 70.7 percent of
the maximum output voltage (or current). Any frequency that produces less than 70.7 percent of the
maximum output voltage (or current) is outside the bandwidth and, in most cases, is not considered a
useable output of the amplifier.
