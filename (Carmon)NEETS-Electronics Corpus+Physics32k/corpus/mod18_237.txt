The TRANSMITTER produces the short duration high-power rf pulses of energy that are radiated
into space by the antenna. Two main types of transmitters are now in common use. The first is the
KEYED-OSCILLATOR type. In this transmitter one stage or tube, usually a magnetron, produces the rf
pulse. The oscillator tube is keyed by a high-power dc pulse of energy generated by a separate unit called
the MODULATOR (discussed in the following section). The second type of transmitter consists of a
POWER-AMPLIFIER CHAIN. This transmitter system begins with an rf pulse of very low power. This
low-level pulse is then amplified by a series (chain) of power amplifiers to the high level of power desired
in a transmitter pulse. In most power-amplifier transmitters, each of the power-amplifier stages is pulse
modulated in a manner similar to the oscillator in the keyed-oscillator type. Because the modulator is
common to both types of transmitter systems, the operation of a typical modulator will be discussed first.
