If the differencing scheme produces coefficients that satisfy the above criterion the resulting matrix of coefficients is diagonally dominant. To achieve diagonal dominance we need large values of net coefficient so the linearisation practice of source terms should ensure that SP is always negative. If this is the case –SP is always positive and adds to aP. Diagonal dominance is a desirable feature for satisfying the boundedness criterion. This states that in the absence of sources the internal nodal values of the property ф should be bounded by its boundary values. Hence in a steady state conduction problem without sources and with boundary temperatures of 500 °C and 200 °C all interior values of T should be less than 500 °C and greater than 200 °C.
