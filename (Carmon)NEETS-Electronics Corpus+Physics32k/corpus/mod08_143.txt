One way in which a phase splitter can be made is to use a center-tapped transformer. As you may 
remember from your study of transformers, when the transformer secondary winding is center-tapped, 
two equal amplitude signals are produced. These signals will be 180ยบ out of phase with each other. So a 
transformer with a center-tapped secondary fulfills the definition of a phase splitter.
