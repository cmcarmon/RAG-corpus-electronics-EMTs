The discipline of digital image processing is a vast one,
encompassing digital signal processing techniques as well as
techniques that are speciﬁc to images. An image can be regarded
as a function f (x, y) of two continuous variables x and y. To be
processed digitally, it has to be sampled and transformed into a
matrix of numbers. Since a computer represents the numbers
using ﬁnite precision, these numbers have to be quantized to be
represented digitally. Digital image processing consists of the
manipulation of those ﬁnite precision numbers. The processing
of digital images can be divided into several classes: image
enhancement, image restoration, image analysis, and image
compression. In image enhancement, an image is manipulated,
mostly by heuristic techniques, so that a human viewer can
