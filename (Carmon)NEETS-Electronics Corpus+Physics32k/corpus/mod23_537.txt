occur at the output of the reproduce amplifier. (1) System noise is the total noise produced
by the whole recording system, including the tape. (2) Equipment noise is produced by all
the components of the system, with the exception of the tape. (3) Tape noise can be
specifically ascribed to the tape. The following are typical sources of tape noise: (a) Bulk-
erased noise arises when a bulk-erased tape with the erase and record heads completely
deenergized is reproduced. (b) Zero-modulation noise arises when an erased tape with the
erase and record heads energized as they would be in normal operation, but with zero input
signal, is reproduced. This noise is usually 3 to 4 dB higher than the bulk-erased noise. The
difference between bulk-erased and zero-modulation noise is sometimes termed bias-induced
noise. (c) Saturation noise arises when a uniformly saturated tape is reproduced. This is often
some 15 dB higher than the bulk-erased noise and is associated with imperfect particle
dispersion. (d) Dc noise arises when a tape that has been non-uniformly magnetized by
energizing the record head with dc, either in the presence or the absence of bias, is
reproduced. This noise has pronounced, long, wavelength components that can be as much
as 20 dB higher than those obtained from a bulk-erased tape. At very high values of dc, the
dc noise approaches the saturation noise. Dc noise is actually the low-frequency component
of modulation noise. (e) Modulation noise is essentially a modulation of the desired signal
by noise that is caused by non-uniform dispersion of elementary magnetic particles in the
