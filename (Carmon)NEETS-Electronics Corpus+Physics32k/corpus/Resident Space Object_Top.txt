A Resident Space Object (RSO) is a natural or artificial object that orbits another body e.g. Sun Orbiting, Earth Orbiting, Mars Orbiting etc. It is most often used to reference objects that are Earth orbiting. In the case of Earth orbiting the possible orbit classifications for an object are: Low Earth orbit (LEO), Medium Earth orbit (MEO), High Earth orbit (HEO) or Geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO)[1].
