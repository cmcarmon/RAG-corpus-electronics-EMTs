Let us assume that the sections of view C continue to the right with an infinite number of sections.
When an infinite number of sections extends to the right, the impedance appearing across K and L is Z0.
If the line is cut at R and S, an infinite number of sections still extends to the right since the line is endless
in that direction. Therefore, the impedance now appearing across points R and S is also Z0, as illustrated
in view D. You can see that if only the first three sections are taken and a load impedance of Z0 is
connected across points R and S, the impedance across the input terminals K and L is still Z0. The line
continues to act as an infinite line. This is illustrated in view E.
