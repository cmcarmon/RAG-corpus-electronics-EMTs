Alternatively, MPEG-21 supports digital
item adaptation
through media resource adaptation. In this case, the media
resources themselves are adapted or transcoded. The media
resources in the digital item declarations can be manipulated
in an adaptation engine according to usage environment. The
adaptation engine can take as input a user environment de-
scription that includes user preferences, usage context, device
capabilities, and so forth.
