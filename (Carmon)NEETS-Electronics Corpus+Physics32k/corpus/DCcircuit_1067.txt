The Maximum Power Transfer Theorem is not so much a means of analysis as it is an aid
to system design. Simply stated, the maximum amount of power will be dissipated by a load
resistance when that load resistance is equal to the Thevenin/Norton resistance of the net-
work supplying the power. If the load resistance is lower or higher than the Thevenin/Norton
resistance of the source network, its dissipated power will be less than maximum.
