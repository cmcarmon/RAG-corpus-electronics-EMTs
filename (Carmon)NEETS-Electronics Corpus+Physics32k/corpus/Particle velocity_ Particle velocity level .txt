Sound velocity level (SVL) or acoustic velocity level or particle velocity level is a logarithmic measure of the effective particle velocity of a sound relative to a reference value.
Sound velocity level, denoted Lv and measured in dB, is defined by

where
v is the root mean square particle velocity;
v0 is the reference particle velocity;
1 Np = 1 is the neper;
1 B = 1/2 ln 10 is the bel;
1 dB = 1/20 ln 10 is the decibel.

The proper notations for sound velocity level using this reference are Lv/(5 × 10−8 m/s) or Lv (re 5 × 10−8 m/s), but the notations dB SVL, dB(SVL), dBSVL, or dBSVL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.
