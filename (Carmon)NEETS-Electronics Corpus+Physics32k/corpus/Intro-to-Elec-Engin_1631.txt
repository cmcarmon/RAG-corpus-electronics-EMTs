The elements of an open-loop control system may be divided into two parts: the controller
and the controlled process, as shown by the block diagram of Figure 16.2.1. An input signal
or command r is applied to the controller, whose output acts as the actuating signal u. The
actuating signal then controls the controlled process such that the controlled variable c will
perform according to some prescribed standards. The controller may be an ampliÔ¨Åer, mechanical
linkage, or other basic control means in simple cases, whereas in more sophisticated electronics
control, it can be an electronic computer such as a microprocessor.
