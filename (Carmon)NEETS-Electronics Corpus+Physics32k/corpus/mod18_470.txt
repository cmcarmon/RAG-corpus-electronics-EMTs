When taking power measurements, you must allow for power losses. You must add the directional 
coupler attenuation factor and the loss in the connecting cable to the power meter reading. The sum is the 
total power reading. For example, the directional coupler has an attenuation factor of 20 dB, the 
connecting cable has a loss rating of 8 dB, and the reading obtained on the power meter is 21 dBm. 
Therefore, the transmitter has an output power that is 49 dBm (21 + 20 + 8). Power readings in dBm 
obtained by the above procedure are normally converted to watts to provide useful information. Although 
the conversion can be accomplished mathematically, the procedure is relatively complex and is seldom 
necessary. Most radar systems have a conversion chart, such as the one shown in figure 4-7, attached to 
the transmitter or the test equipment. As you can see on the chart, 49 dBm is easily converted to 80 watts 
average power.
