The  inductance  of  an  inductor  depends  on  its  physical  dimension
and construction. Formulas for calculating the inductance of inductors
of different shapes are derived from electromagnetic theory and can be
found  in  standard  electrical  engineering  handbooks.  For  example,  for
the inductor, (solenoid) shown in Fig. 6.21,
