Nortonâ€™s  theorem states  that  a  linear  two-terminal  circuit  can  be
replaced  by  an  equivalent  circuit  consisting  of  a  current  source  IN in
parallel  with  a  resistor  RN,  where  IN is  the  short-circuit  current  through
the  terminals  and  RN is  the  input  or  equivalent  resistance  at  the  termi-
nals when the independent sources are turned off.
