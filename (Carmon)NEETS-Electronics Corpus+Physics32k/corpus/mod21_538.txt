SWEPT-FREQUENCY TESTING is performed by using a TRACKING GENERATOR to inject 
a signal into a device and then monitoring the output of the device with a spectrum analyzer. The tracking 
generator is designed to sweep or scan through the entire frequency range of the device being tested. Its 
sweep rate must be matched with the sweep rate of the spectrum analyzer.
