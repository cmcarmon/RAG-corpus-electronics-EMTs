13.2.20 A three-phase, 400-V, wye-connected induction
motor takes the full-load current at 45 V with the
rotor blocked. The full-load slip is 4%. Calculate
the tappings k on a three-phase autotransformer
to limit the starting current to 4 times the full-
load current. For such a limitation, determine the
ratio of starting torque to full-load torque.
