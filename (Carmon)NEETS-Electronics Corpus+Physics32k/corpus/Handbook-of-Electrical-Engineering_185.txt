One type of HRC fuse found in Canada, but not in the United States, is the HRCII-C or Class C fuse. This
fuse was developed originally in England and is constructed with bolt-on-type blade contacts. It is available in
a voltage rating of 600 V with ampere ratings from 2 to 600 A. Some higher ampere ratings are also available
but  are  not  as  common.  HRCII-C  fuses  are  primarily  regarded  as  providing  short-circuit  protection  only.
Therefore, they should be used in conjunction with an overload device.
