A  monopolar  system  will  have  one  conductor,  either  positive  or  negative  polarity  with  current  returning
through either ground or another metallic return conductor. The monopolar ground return current conﬁgu-
ration, shown in Fig. 61.8, has been used for undersea cable systems, where current returns through the sea.
This conﬁguration can also be used for short-term emergency operation for a two-terminal dc line system in
the event of a pole outage. However, concerns for corrosion of underground metallic structures and interference
with telephone and other utilities will restrict the duration of such operation. The total ampere-hour operation
per year is usually the restricting criterion.
