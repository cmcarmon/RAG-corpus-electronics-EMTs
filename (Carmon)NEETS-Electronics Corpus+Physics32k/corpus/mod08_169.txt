As you should recall, rf amplifiers are used to amplify signals between 10 kilohertz (10 kHz) and
100,000 megahertz (100,000 MHz) (not this entire band of frequencies, but any band of frequencies
within these limits). Therefore, any device that uses frequencies between 10 kilohertz and 100,000
megahertz will most likely use an rf amplifier.
