Kat is a teenage girl with tan skin, red eyes, and blonde hair. She wears a brown leotard held on her body by elastic, decorative pieces of gold metal. She also wears a wing-like cape on her back, a headband, a scarf and two bracers, as well as tall socks with high heels.
Kat initially awakens after falling out of the sky and landing in a small playground in Hekseville, a city that is suspended in midair and attached to a massive vertical stone pillar called the World Pillar. Realizing she has amnesia, she sets out to look for the origins of her gravity shifting powers and begins helping people in Hekseville. Eventually she discovers the threat of the Nevi, mysterious interdimensional creatures that begin attacking the citizens of Hekseville, and becomes the city's defender, the "Gravity Queen". She comes into conflict with Raven, a fellow gravity shifter of unknown origin.
In Gravity Rush 2, Kat is taken through a portal into another universe, that of Jirga Para Lhao. She finally escapes and goes back to Hekseville, where she saves the city yet again. Climbing the World Pillar, she discovers that she is actually Queen Alua, the ruler of a lost civilization called Eto, but an advisor named Xicero attempted to murder her for wanting to save the city below from an oncoming black hole that marks the world's destruction and rebirth. She eventually escapes and returns to Hekseville, where she saves the city a final time from a dark force that has merged with the current ruler of Eto, an evil gravity-shifting child named Cai. She seals away the black hole, presumably perishing in the process, but she is hinted at being alive in the ending.
