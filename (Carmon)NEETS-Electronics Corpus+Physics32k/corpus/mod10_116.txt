Even though solids such as steel and glass are far more dense than air, their elasticityâ€™s are so much
greater that the velocities of sound in them are 15 times greater than the velocity of sound in air. Using
elasticity as a rough indication of the speed of sound in a given medium, we can state as a general rule
that sound travels faster in harder materials (such as steel), slower in liquids, and slowest in gases.
Density has the opposite effect on the velocity of sound, that is, with other factors constant, a denser
material (such as lead) passes sound slower.
