A more common variation of this thought experiment is to send back the signal to the sender (a similar one was given by David Bohm). Suppose Alice (A) is on a spacecraft moving away from the Earth in the positive x-direction with a speed



v


{\displaystyle v}
, and she wants to communicate with Bob (B) back home. Assume both of them have a device that is capable of transmitting and receiving faster-than-light signals at a speed of



a


{\displaystyle a}




c


{\displaystyle c}
with



a
>
1


{\displaystyle a>1}
. Alice uses this device to send a message to Bob, who sends a reply back. Let us choose the origin of the coordinates of Bob's reference frame,



S


{\displaystyle S}
, to coincide with the reception of Alice's message to him. If Bob immediately sends a message back to Alice, then in his rest frame the coordinates of the reply signal (in natural units so that c=1) are given by:




(
t
,
x
)
=
(
t
,
a
t
)


{\displaystyle (t,x)=(t,at)}

To find out when the reply is received by Alice, we perform a Lorentz transformation to Alice's frame




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}
moving in the positive x-direction with velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
with respect to the Earth. In this frame Alice is at rest at position




x
′

=
L


{\displaystyle x'=L}
, where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the distance that the signal Alice sent to Earth traversed in her rest frame. The coordinates of the reply signal are given by:





t
′

=
γ

(

1
−
a
v

)

t


{\displaystyle t'=\gamma \left(1-av\right)t}






x
′

=
γ

(

a
−
v

)

t


{\displaystyle x'=\gamma \left(a-v\right)t}

The reply is received by Alice when




x
′

=
L


{\displaystyle x'=L}
. This means that



t
=



L

γ
(
a
−
v
)






{\displaystyle t={\tfrac {L}{\gamma (a-v)}}}
and thus:





t
′

=



1
−
a
v


a
−
v



L


{\displaystyle t'={\frac {1-av}{a-v}}L}

Since the message Alice sent to Bob took a time of






L
a





{\displaystyle {\tfrac {L}{a}}}
to reach him, the message she receives back from him will reach her at time:




T
=


L
a


+

t
′

=

(



1
a


+



1
−
a
v


a
−
v




)

L


{\displaystyle T={\frac {L}{a}}+t'=\left({\frac {1}{a}}+{\frac {1-av}{a-v}}\right)L}

later than she sent her message. However, if



v
>




2
a


1
+

a

2








{\displaystyle v>{\tfrac {2a}{1+a^{2}}}}
then



T
<
0


{\displaystyle T<0}
and Alice will receive the message back from Bob before she sends her message to him in the first place.
