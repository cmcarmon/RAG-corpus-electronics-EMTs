A  casual  examination  of  signal  restoration  algorithm  (14.99)  indicates  that  it  is  of  the  same  form  as  the
sequence of projections algorithms described in the previous two subsections. It distinguishes itself from those
algorithms in that the attribute sets Ck need not be closed subspaces, closed linear varieties, or closed convex
sets. The proposed algorithm also distinguishes itself from several other signal restoration algorithms in that
the metric d need not be inner product induced. These can be important considerations in speciÔ¨Åc applications.
As an example, it has been conjectured by several authors that the l1 norm provides for a more effective error
measure when the data set has outliers (i.e., unrepresentative data). Signal restoration algorithm (14.99) can
be directly applied to such problems since we have not restricted the metric. It must be observed, however, that
the  nature  of  the  individual  projection  operators  Pk  is  typically  most  easily  characterized  when  the  metric
employed is inner product induced.
