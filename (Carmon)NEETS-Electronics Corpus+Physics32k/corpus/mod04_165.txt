When a soldering iron or gun is used, heating and cooling cycles tend to loosen the nuts or screws 
that hold the replaceable tips. When the nut on a gun becomes loose, the resistance of the tip connection 
increases. The temperature of the connection is increased, thus reducing the heat at the tip. Continued 
loosening may eventually cause an open circuit. Therefore, check and tighten the nut or screw, as needed.
