In classical physics, momentum is the product of mass and velocity and is a vector quantity, but in fluid mechanics it is treated as a longitudinal quantity (i.e. one dimension) evaluated in the direction of flow. Additionally, it is evaluated as momentum per unit time, corresponding to the product of mass flow rate and velocity, and therefore it has units of force. The momentum forces considered in open channel flow are dynamic force – dependent of depth and flow rate – and static force – dependent of depth – both affected by gravity.
The principle of conservation of momentum in open channel flow is applied in terms of specific force, or the momentum function; which has units of length cubed for any cross sectional shape, or can be treated as length squared in the case of rectangular channels. Although not being technically correct, the term momentum will be used to replace the concept of the momentum function. The conjugate depth equation, which describes the depths on either side of a hydraulic jump, can be derived from the conservation of momentum in rectangular channels, based upon the relationship between momentum and depth of flow. The concept of momentum can also be applied to evaluate the thrust force on a sluice gate, a device that conserves specific energy but loses momentum.
