The bandwidth and the resonance frequency Ï‰o are marked in Figure 14.15, which
shows the magnitude plot on a log scale. The bandwidth and resonance frequency are
also marked on the magnitude plot drawn on a linear scale in Figure 14.16. The phase
is plotted in Figures 14.17 and 14.18 on log and linear scales, respectively.
