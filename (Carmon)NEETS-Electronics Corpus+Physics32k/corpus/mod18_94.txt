The temperature and moisture content of the atmosphere normally decrease uniformly with an
increase in altitude. However, under certain conditions the temperature may first increase with height and
then begin to decrease. Such a situation is called a temperature inversion. An even more important
deviation from normal may exist over the ocean. Since the atmosphere close to the surface over large
bodies of water may contain more than a normal amount of moisture, the moisture content may decrease
more rapidly at heights just above the sea. This effect is referred to as MOISTURE LAPSE.
