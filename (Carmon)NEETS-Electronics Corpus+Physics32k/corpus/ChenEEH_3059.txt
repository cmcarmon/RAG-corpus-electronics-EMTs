are connected together in a manner to achieve the desired
voltage transformation ratio. The overall assembly of core
and coils is generally insulated and cooled by immersion in
mineral oil or other suitable liquid in an enclosing tank.
Connection to the windings is usually by means of insulated
bushings.
