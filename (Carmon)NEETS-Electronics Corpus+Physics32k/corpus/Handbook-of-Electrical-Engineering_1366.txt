The  ultimate  goal  of  speech enhancement is  to  minimize  the  effects  of  the  noise  on  the  performance  of
speech communication systems. The performance measure is system dependent. For systems which comprise
recordings of noisy speech, or standard analog communication systems, the goal of speech enhancement is to
improve perceptual aspects of the noisy signal. For example, improving the quality and intelligibility of the
noisy signal are common goals. Quality is a subjective measure which reﬂects on the pleasantness of the speech
or on the amount of effort needed to understand the speech material. Intelligibility, on the other hand, is an
objective  measure  which  signiﬁes  the  amount  of  speech  material  correctly  understood.  For  standard  digital
communication systems, the goal of speech enhancement is to improve perceptual aspects of the encoded speech
signal. For human-machine speech communication systems, the goal of speech enhancement is to reduce the
error rate in recognizing the noisy speech signals.
