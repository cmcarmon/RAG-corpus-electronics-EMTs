In Figure 4-14, the positive terminal of the battery is connected to the top 
terminal of an SPDT switch. The center terminal of the switch is connected to 
the leftmost column of the breadboard, which is also known as a power rail. 
By moving the slider on the switch, you make or break a connection between 
the positive terminal of the battery and the positive power rail. AsÂ long 
as you use the power rails to supply power to your circuits, your switch 
 functions as an on/off switch for powering your breadboard circuits.
