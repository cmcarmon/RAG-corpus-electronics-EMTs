In figure 1-47, the rf carrier is applied to the base of modulator Q1. The modulating signal is applied 
to the collector in series with the collector supply voltage through T3. The output is then taken from the 
secondary of T2. With no modulating signal, Q1 acts as an rf amplifier for the carrier frequency. When 
the modulation signal is applied, it adds to or subtracts from the collector supply voltage. This causes the 
rf current pulses of the collector to vary in amplitude with the collector supply voltage. These collector 
current pulses cause oscillations in the tank circuit (C4 and the primary of T2). The tank circuit is tuned to 
the carrier frequency. During periods when the collector current is high, the tank circuit oscillates 
strongly. At times when the collector current is small, or entirely absent, little or no energy is supplied to 
the tank and oscillations become weak or die out. Thus, the modulation envelope is developed as it was in 
a plate modulator.
