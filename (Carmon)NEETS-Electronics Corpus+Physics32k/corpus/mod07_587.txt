TROUBLESHOOTING is a method of detecting and repairing problems in electronic equipment. 
Two methods commonly used are the VISUAL CHECK and SIGNAL TRACING. The visual check 
allows the technician to make a quick check of component problems, such as shorts, discolored or leaky 
transformers, loose or broken connections, damaged resistors or capacitors, smoking parts, or sparking. 
The signal tracing method is used when the technician cannot readily see the problem and needs to use 
test equipment. Component failure is also important in troubleshooting. In transformers and chokes, a 
winding can open, or two or more windings can short, either to themselves or to the case that is usually 
grounded. In a capacitor only two things can occur: either it can short and act as a resistor, or it can open, 
removing it from the circuit. A resistor can open, increase in value, or decrease in value.
