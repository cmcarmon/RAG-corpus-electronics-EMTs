 appears many times in the preceding paragraphs. What are these applications? Many
of the practical uses of the phenomena described in this section are in measuring the variables that deﬁne the
 constitute a primary application. For instance, the Hall effect can be used to measure
phenomena. Thus, 
magnetic ﬁelds, and mechanical strain can be measured using the phenomenon of piezoelectricity.
Just  as  photons  will  interact  with  electric  ﬁelds,  so,  too,  will  they  affect  and  be  affected  by  magnetic  ﬁelds.
Magnetooptics
 is the study and application of these interactions. As with electrooptics, the increased activity in
optical communications has provided renewed interest in this ﬁeld.
