As you know, gravity is a force that acts along parallel lines upon each particle of matter. A plot of 
the resultant gravitational force on a body such as a gyro would be equivalent to the sum of these separate 
forces. The point at which the resultant force is applied is called the CENTER OF GRAVITY. To have a 
balanced gyro, the center of gravity must be located at the intersection of the three axes of the gyro.
