An observer rotating around another inertial observer is in an accelerated frame of reference. For such an observer, the incremental (



d
τ



{\displaystyle d\tau \ }
) form of the proper time equation is needed, along with a parameterized description of the path being taken, as shown below.
Let there be an observer C on a disk rotating in the xy plane at a coordinate angular rate of



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
and who is at a distance of r from the center of the disk with the center of the disk at x=y=z=0. The path of observer C is given by

{\displaystyle (T,\;\,r\cos(\omega T),\;\,r\sin(\omega T),\;\,0)}
, where



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the current coordinate time. When r and



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
are constant,



d

{\displaystyle dx=-r\omega \sin(\omega T)\;dT}
and



d

cos

(
ω

)

d

{\displaystyle dy=r\omega \cos(\omega T)\;dT}
. The incremental proper time formula then becomes

{\displaystyle d\tau ={\sqrt {dT^{2}-(r\omega /c)^{2}\sin ^{2}(\omega T)\;dT^{2}-(r\omega /c)^{2}\cos ^{2}(\omega T)\;dT^{2}}}=dT{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {r\omega }{c}}\right)^{2}}}.}

So for an observer rotating at a constant distance of r from a given point in spacetime at a constant angular rate of ω between coordinate times




T

{\displaystyle T_{1}}
and




T

{\displaystyle T_{2}}
, the proper time experienced will be

as v=rω for a rotating observer. This result is the same as for the linear motion example, and shows the general application of the integral form of the proper time formula.
