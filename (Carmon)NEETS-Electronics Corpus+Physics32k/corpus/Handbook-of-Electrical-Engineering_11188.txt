When an individual neuron is excited, an electrical sig-
nal is transmitted along its axon to many tiny branching,
diverging  Ô¨Åbers  near  its  far  end.  These  axonal  terminals
end as synapse on a large number of other neurons. When
an  electrical  pulse  arrives  at  the  synapse,  it  triggers  the
release  of  a  tiny  amount  of  transmitter  substance  which
crosses  the  synaptic  cleft  thereby  altering  the  membrane  potential  of  the  receiving  neuron.  If  the  change  is
above a certain threshold value, the neuron is activated and generates an action potential of its own which is
propagated along its axon, and the process is repeated.
