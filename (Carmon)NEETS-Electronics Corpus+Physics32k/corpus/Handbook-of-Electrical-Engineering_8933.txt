somewhat difﬁcult to use with raster systems. This device goes by a misleading name, as it does not emit light
and is not a pen other than being somewhat similar to one in its physical appearance, as shown in Fig. 89.3(a).
However,  when  we  consider  its  functional  characteristics,  the  validity  of  the  term  becomes  apparent,  as  it  is
used  to  cause  the  electron  beam  to “write”  patterns  on  the  cathode  ray  tube  (CRT)  that  are  deﬁned  by  the
motion of the light pen on the CRT faceplate.
