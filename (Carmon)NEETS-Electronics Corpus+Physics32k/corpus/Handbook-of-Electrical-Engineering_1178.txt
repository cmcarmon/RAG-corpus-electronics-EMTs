where  s  designates  the  signal  being  monitored  and  w  represents  measurement  error.  From  our  previous
discussion, it has been hypothesized that the monitored signal lies in each of the attribute sets so that s ˛Ck
for 1 £  k £  m. To effectively recover s from x using signal restoration, it is tacitly assumed that the measurement
error vector w has features which are distinctly different from those speciﬁed by these m attribute subsets.
