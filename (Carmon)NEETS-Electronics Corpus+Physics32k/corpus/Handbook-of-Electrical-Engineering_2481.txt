The circuit in Fig. 24.21 is in the form of two cascaded RC low-
pass  networks.  The  RC  time  constant  on  the  input  side  is  t
1  =
uuRG] · Cin @ R1 · Cin, where R1 is the signal-source resistance. The
[R1
RC time constant on the output side is given by t2 = Rnet · CO. The
corresponding breakpoint frequencies are
