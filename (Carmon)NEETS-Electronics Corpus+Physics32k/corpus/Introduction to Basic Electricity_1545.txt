In the home, all electrical circuits and appliances 
are earth grounded. Consequently, no difference of 
potential exists between any two appliances or circuits. 
All circuits are tied to a common point in the circuit 
panel box (circuit breaker or fuse box) (Figure 12-27). 
This common point (the neutral bus) is then con-
nected by a heavy copper wire to a copper rod driven
