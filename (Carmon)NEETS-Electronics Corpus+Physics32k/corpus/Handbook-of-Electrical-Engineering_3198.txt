Parallel resonant converters [Fig. 30.32(b)] are suitable for low output voltage, high output current applica-
tions due to the use of ﬁlter inductance at the output with low ripple current requirements for the ﬁlter capacitor.
The major disadvantage of the PRC is that the device currents do not decrease with the load current, resulting
in reduced efﬁciency at reduced load currents.
