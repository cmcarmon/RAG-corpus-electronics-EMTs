If a small ac signal voltage vGS is superimposed on the dc gate bias voltage VGS , only a small segment of the
transfer characteristic adjacent to the Q point will be traversed, as shown in Fig. 24.14. This small segment will
be close to a straight line, and as a result the ac drain current ids will have a waveform close to that of the ac
voltage applied to the gate. The ratio of ids to vGS will be the slope of the transfer curve as given by id s /vGS @
dID S /dVGS = gm. Thus ids @ gmvGS. If the net load driven by the drain of the JFET is the drain load resistor R D,
as shown in Fig. 24.13, then the ac drain current ids will produce an ac drain voltage of vds = –ids · RD. Since
ids = gmvGS , this becomes vds = –gmvGS · R D. The ac small-signal voltage gain from gate to drain thus becomes
AV = vO /vin = vd s /vGS = –gm · RD. The negative sign indicates signal inversion as is the case for a CS ampliﬁer.
If the dc drain supply voltage is VDD = +20 V, a quiescent drain-to-source voltage of VDSQ = VDD/2 = +10 V
will result in the JFET being biased in the middle of the active region. Since IDSQ = +5 mA in the example under
consideration, the voltage drop across the drain load resistor RD is 10 V. Thus RD = 10 V/5 mA = 2 kW. The ac
small-signal voltage gain AV thus becomes AV = –gm · RD = –3.54 mS · 2 kW = –7.07. Note that the voltage gain
is relatively modest as compared to the much larger voltage gains that can be obtained in a bipolar-junction
transistor (BJT) common-emitter ampliﬁer. This is due to the lower transfer conductance of both JFETs and
MOSFETs  (metal-oxide  semiconductor  ﬁeld-effect  transistors)  as  compared  to  BJTs.  For  a  BJT  the  transfer
conductance is given by gm = IC /VT , where IC is the quiescent collector current and VT = kT/q @ 25 mV is the
thermal voltage. At IC = 5 mA, gm = 5 mA/25 mV = 200 mS, as compared to only 3.5 mS for the JFET in this
example. With a net load of 2 kW, the BJT voltage gain will be –400 as compared to the JFET voltage gain of
only  7.1.  Thus  FETs  do  have  the  disadvantage  of  a  much  lower  transfer  conductance,  and  therefore  voltage
gain,  than  BJTs  operating  under  similar  quiescent  current  levels,  but  they  do  have  the  major  advantage  of  a
much higher input impedance and a much lower input current. In the case of a JFET the input signal is applied
to the reverse-biased gate-to-channel pn junction and thus sees a very high impedance. In the case of a common-
emitter  BJT  ampliﬁer,  the  input  signal  is  applied  to  the forward-biased  base-emitter  junction,  and  the  input
impedance is given approximately by rin = rBE @ 1.5 · b · VT /IC. If IC = 5 mA and b = 200, for example, then
rin @ 1500 W. This moderate input resistance value of 1.5 kW is certainly no problem if the signal source resistance
is less than around 100 W. However, if the source resistance is above 1 kW, then there will be a substantial signal
loss in the coupling of the signal from the signal source to the base of the transistor. If the source resistance is
in the range of above 100 kW, and certainly if it is above 1 MW, then there will be severe signal attenuation
due to the BJT input impedance, and the FET ampliﬁer will probably offer a greater overall voltage gain. Indeed,
when high-impedance signal sources are encountered, a multistage ampliﬁer with a FET input stage followed
by cascaded BJT stages is often used.
