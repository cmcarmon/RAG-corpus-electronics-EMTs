Saturation Nonlinearity
To calculate the DF, the input can alternatively be taken as a sin q. For an ideal saturation characteristic, the
nonlinearity output wave form y(q) is as shown in Fig. 100.43. Because of the symmetry of the nonlinearity,
the fundamental of the output can be evaluated from the integral over a quarter period so that
