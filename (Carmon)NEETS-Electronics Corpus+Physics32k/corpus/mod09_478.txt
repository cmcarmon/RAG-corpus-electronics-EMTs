Another method of electron beam deflection is ELECTROMAGNETIC DEFLECTION. Currents 
through a coil produce electromagnetic fields which position the beam of electrons. The electromagnetic 
system requires a sawtooth of current which increases at a linear rate. Because of the inherent 
characteristics of a coil, a sawtooth voltage does not cause a linear increase of current. A linear increase 
of current requires a TRAPEZOIDAL voltage waveform applied to a coil. This section discusses the 
generation of a trapezoidal wave.
