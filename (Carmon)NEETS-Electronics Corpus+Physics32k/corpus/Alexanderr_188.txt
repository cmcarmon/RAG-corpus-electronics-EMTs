Theveninâ€™s  theorem states  that  a  linear  two-terminal  circuit  can  be
replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source VTh in
series  with  a  resistor  RTh,  where  VTh is  the  open-circuit  voltage  at  the
terminals  and  RTh is  the  input  or  equivalent  resistance  at  the  terminals
when the independent sources are turned off.
