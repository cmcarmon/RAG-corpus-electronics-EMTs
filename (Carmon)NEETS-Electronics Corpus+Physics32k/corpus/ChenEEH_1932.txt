As we mentioned in Section 8.1.1, the generic approach to
increasing system reliability is to use some form of redun-
dancy. However, redundancy at the chip level is not cost-
effective for FPGAs, especially given the fact that such chips
already lag behind in device density to custom ASIC chips.
Furthermore, chip-level redundancy is not a feasible solution
for various space-based and other systems for which weight,
space, and power are at a premium and need to be optimized.
Fortunately, FPGAs provide a ﬁne granularity of replicated
identical components (logic cells and interconnect segments)
that can potentially be exploited to provide both testing and
fault tolerance capabilities at low hardware and time over-
heads. We focus here on reprogrammable SRAM-based
FPGAs (with a segmented wiring architecture) that are the
most prevalent kind (e.g., Xilinx [Xilinx, 1994], Lucent
ORCA [Lucent Technologies, 1998] and Altera Flex 8000
[Altera corporation, 1993] FPGA families) and also offer the
most reprogramming ﬂexibility needed for reconﬁguration.
Such a generic FPGA is shown in Figure 8.6.
