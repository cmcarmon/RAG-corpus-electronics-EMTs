Voltage-Variable Resistor
Operation of a JFET as a Voltage-Variable Resistor
We  will  now  consider  the  operation  of  a  JFET  as  a  voltage-variable
resistor (VVR). A JFET can be used as a VVR in which the drain-to-
source resistance rds of the JFET can be varied by variation of VGS. For
values of VDS << VP the IDS vs. VDS characteristics are approximately
linear, so the JFET looks like a resistor, the resistance value of which
can be varied by the gate voltage as shown in Fig. 24.23.
