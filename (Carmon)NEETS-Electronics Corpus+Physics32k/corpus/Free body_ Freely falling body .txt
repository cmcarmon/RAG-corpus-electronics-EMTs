A free body should also be distinguished from a freely falling body. In Newtonian physics, the latter term refers to a body which is falling under pure gravity with all other forces being zero. In Einstein's general theory of relativity, where gravity becomes curvature of spacetime, a freely falling body is subject to no forces whatsoever and is a body moving along a geodesic. A free body in the context of this article may not be following a geodesic and may be subject to all sorts of forces, gravitational and other.
