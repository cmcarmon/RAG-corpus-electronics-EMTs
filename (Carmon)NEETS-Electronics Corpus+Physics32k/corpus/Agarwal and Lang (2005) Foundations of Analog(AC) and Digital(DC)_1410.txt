which is the voltage across the resistor (V − VO) divided by the resistance (R).
Thus, at the instant that the switch S1 is closed, the capacitor behaves like
an instantaneous voltage source with voltage VO. In like manner, if the initial
voltage on the capacitor were zero (that is, VO = 0), then the capacitor would
behave like an instantaneous short circuit. In either case, notice that the capacitor
current is not necessarily continuous, only the state variable. In our example,
the capacitor current jumps from 0 to (V − VO)/R at t = 0. The current decays
exponentially with time constant RC from the initial value of (V − VO)/R at
t = 0 to its final value of zero. The current response is plotted in Figure 10.12.
Inductors can be treated in a similar manner. The key difference is that the
state variable for an inductor is its current. Accordingly, the inductor current
is continuous (recall, from Equation 9.26, an instantaneous jump in induc-
tor current requires an infinite spike, that is, an impulse, in the voltage). To
determine initial and final values of the inductor current, remember that the
inductor behaves like a long-term short circuit for DC current sources, and like
an instantaneous open circuit for abrupt transitions.5 The time constant for
circuits containing an inductor and a resistor is L/R. With these definitions,
Equation 10.61 is equally applicable to inductor-resistor circuits.
