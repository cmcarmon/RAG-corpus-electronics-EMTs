Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29, 1982 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research (Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung) in Darmstadt. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of iron-58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium-266:
20983Bi + 5826Fe → 266109Mt + n
This work was confirmed three years later at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union).
