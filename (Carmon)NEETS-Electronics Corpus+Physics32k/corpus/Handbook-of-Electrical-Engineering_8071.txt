Other components in the system include input/output (I/O) interfaces to devices such as printers, terminals,
disks, mice, and so on. The common feature of all of these devices is that they interface the microprocessor to
the outside world. All of the components in the microcomputer are connected together by a system bus. The
bus is a set of parallel wires that carry information from one component to another.
