Liquid-ring vacuum pumps can use any liquid compatible with the process, provided it has the appropriate vapor pressure properties, as the sealant liquid. Although the most common sealant is water, almost any liquid can be used. The second most common is oil. Since oil has a very low vapor pressure, oil-sealed liquid-ring vacuum pumps are typically air-cooled.
The ability to use any liquid allows the liquid-ring vacuum pump to be ideally suited for solvent (vapor) recovery. If a process, such as distillation or a vacuum dryer, is generating toluene vapors, for example, then it is possible to use toluene as the sealant, provided the cooling water is cold enough to keep the vapor pressure of the sealant liquid low enough to pull the desired vacuum.
Ionic liquids in liquid-ring vacuum pumps can lower the vacuum pressure from about 70 mbar to below 1 mbar.
