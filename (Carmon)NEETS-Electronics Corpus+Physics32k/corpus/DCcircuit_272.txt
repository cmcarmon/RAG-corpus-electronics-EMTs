Such an accidental connection between a power system conductor and the earth (ground) is
called a ground fault. Ground faults may be caused by many things, including dirt buildup on
power line insulators (creating a dirty-water path for current from the conductor to the pole,
and to the ground, when it rains), ground water inﬁltration in buried power line conductors,
and birds landing on power lines, bridging the line to the pole with their wings. Given the
many causes of ground faults, they tend to be unpredicatable. In the case of trees, no one can
guarantee which wire their branches might touch. If a tree were to brush up against the top
wire in the circuit, it would make the top wire safe to touch and the bottom one dangerous –
just the opposite of the previous scenario where the tree contacts the bottom wire:
