Relative immunity to short circuits caused by external forces (wind, fallen branches), unless they abrade the insulation.
Can stand in close proximity to trees/buildings and will not generate sparks if touched.
Little to no tree trimming necessary
Simpler installation, as crossbars and insulators are not required.
Ease of erection and stringing, less labor intensive, less construction resources needed.
More aesthetically appealing.
Can be installed in a narrower right-of-way.
At junction poles, insulating bridging wires are needed to connect non-insulated wires at either side. ABC can dispense with one of these splices.
Less risk of a neutral-only break from tree or vehicle damage, increasing safety with TNC-s systems.
Significantly improved safety for linespersons, particularly when working on live conductors.
Electricity theft is made harder, and more obvious to detect.
Less required maintenance and necessary inspections of lines.
Improved reliability in comparison with both bare conductor overhead systems and underground systems. Insulated conductors prevent accidental contact and supply can be maintained temporarily in the event of a suspension system collapse.
