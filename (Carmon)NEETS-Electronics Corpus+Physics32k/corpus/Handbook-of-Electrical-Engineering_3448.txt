The primary thermal transport mechanisms and commonly used heat removal techniques vary substantially
from one packaging level to the next. While Level 1 thermal packaging is primarily concerned with conducting
heat from the chip to the package, at Level 2 attention must be devoted to heat spreading by conduction in the
printed circuit board and convection of the heat tot he ambient air, and/or transport of the heat to the board
edge. Many of today’s electronic systems, as might be surmised from the frequently cited “computer-on-a-chip”
or  “computer-on-a-board”  terminology,  can  be  adequately  packaged  at  Level  1  or  2.  Heat  sinks,  or  ﬁnned
surfaces protruding into the air stream, are often used at Level 1 and 2 to aid in the transfer of heat into the
ambient air. When Level 3 and/or 4 are present, thermal packaging generally involves the use of active thermal
control measures, such as air handling systems, refrigeration systems, or water channels, heat exchangers, and
pumps.
