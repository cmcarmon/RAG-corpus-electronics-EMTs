Positive displacement (PD) flowmeters are highly accurate meters that are widely used for custody transfer of commercial and industrial water, as well as for custody transfer of many other liquids. PD flowmeters have the advantage that they have been approved by a number of regulatory bodies for this purpose, and they have not yet been displaced by other applications.
PD meters excel at measuring low flows, and also at measuring highly viscous flows, because PD meters captures the flow in a container of known volume. Speed of flow doesnâ€™t matter when using a PD meter.
