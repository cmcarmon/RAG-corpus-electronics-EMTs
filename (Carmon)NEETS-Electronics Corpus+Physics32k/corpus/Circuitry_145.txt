It  is,  however,  important  to  note  that  the  output 
current  (Iout) will  fall  when  the  load  connected  to 
the output terminals has any appreciable resistance.  
 
Example 3.5 
 
A moving coil meter requires a current of 1 mA to 
provide full-scale deflection. If the meter coil has a 
resistance  of  100  F and  is  to  be  used  as  a 
milliammeter  reading  5  mA  full-scale,  determine 
the value of parallel shunt resistor required. 
 
Solution 
 
This problem may sound a little complicated so it is 
worth taking a look at the equivalent circuit of the 
meter (Fig. 3.12) and comparing it with the current 
divider shown in Fig. 3.11. 
  We  can  apply  the  current  divider  formula, 
replacing Iout with Im (the meter full-scale deflection 
current) and R2 with Rm (the meter resistance). R1 is 
the required value of shunt resistor, Rs, Hence:
