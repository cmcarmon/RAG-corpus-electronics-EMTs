In the basic jazz hands position, the hands are open, the palms face forward, and the fingers are splayed; in addition sometimes the hands are shaken and the fingers are moving. The arm is often straight. Gus Giordano describes the position as the "palm of the hand facing forward with fingers stretched". Frank Hatchett instructs dancers to "spread fingers (jazz hands); face palms front".
Neither Gus Giordano nor Frank Hatchett include shaking the hands in their description of jazz hands, but a choreographer may specify that the hands are to be shakenâ€”the motion is rapid and fluttering, as if jingling a tambourine.
