Personalizing process: The personalizing process is performed by a card manufacturer. The goal is to make
a  masked  chip  card  that  the  customer  can  use.  The  process  covers  loading  onto  the  card  all  speciﬁc
customer  info  (name,  primary  security  keys,  serial  number)  as  well  as  building  the  internal  memory
structure (directories, ﬁle structures, ﬁle types).
