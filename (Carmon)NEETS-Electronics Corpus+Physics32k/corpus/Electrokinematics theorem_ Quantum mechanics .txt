Finally, the electrokinetics theorem holds true in the classical mechanics limit, because it requires the simultaneous knowledge of the position and velocity of the carrier, that is, as a result of the uncertainty principle, when its wave function is essentially non null in a volume smaller than that of device. Such a limit can however be overcome computing the current density according to the quantum mechanical expression.
