The thermal conductivity of a gas can be found through analysis of a gasâ€™ viscosity except the molecules are stationary while only the temperatures of the gases are changing. Thermal conductivity is stated as the amount of heat transported across a specific area in a specific time. The thermal conductivity always flows opposite of the direction of the temperature gradient.
