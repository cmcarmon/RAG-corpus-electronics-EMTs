Figure 5.4: The spectrum of some bandlimited (to W Hz) signal is shown in the top plot.
If the
sampling interval Ts is chosen too large relative to the bandwidth W , aliasing will occur. In the bottom
plot, the sampling interval is chosen suï¬ƒciently small to avoid aliasing. Note that if the signal were not
bandlimited, the component spectra would always overlap.
