View A of figure 1-25 shows the circuit under quiescent conditions. You will notice that the circuit
is similar to the one we used to explain the action of a triode. The only additions are the grid resistor, Rg
coupling capacitor, Cc, and resistance rgk. Resistance rgk doesn’t exist as a physical component, but it is
used to represent the internal tube resistance between the triode’s cathode and grid. Electrically, rgk is
quite small, about 500 ohms. Under quiescent conditions, some conduction occurs through the tube. Some
electrons will strike the wires of the grid, and a small amount of GRID CURRENT will flow through Rg
to ground. This will cause the right-hand plate of Cc to go slightly negative. This slight negative charge
will, in turn, keep the grid of the tube slightly negative. This limits the number of electrons that strike the
grid wires.
