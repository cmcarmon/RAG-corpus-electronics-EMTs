The most common type of static calorimeter is the ADIABATIC calorimeter. In the adiabatic meter, 
power is applied directly to a thermally isolated body; and the rate of temperature rise is determined from 
a temperature change measurement during a sufficiently long, known time interval. Figure 3-19 illustrates 
an adiabatic calorimeter using water as the body contained in a covered Dewar flask. A tapered-wall, 
open-ended waveguide contains a sealed, inclined glass partition to create a wedge-shaped water load of 
low-reflection coefficient. Thorough mixing of the water is accomplished with a stirrer, and a sensitive 
thermometer measures the temperature rise. A heating coil is wound around the waveguide inside the 
calorimeter and is used for calibrating purposes when low-frequency power is applied. This type of meter 
can be used for accurate measurement of several hundred watts of average power and can withstand 50 
kilowatts of peak power.
