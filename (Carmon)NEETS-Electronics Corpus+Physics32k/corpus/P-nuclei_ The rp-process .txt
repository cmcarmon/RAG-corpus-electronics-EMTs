The so-called rp-process (rp is for rapid proton capture) is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than 1028 protons/cm3 and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the proton drip line. The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei "behind" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.
A definitive endpoint is reached close to 107Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by alpha decay and thus loop the path back onto itself. Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with mass numbers less than or equal to 107.
