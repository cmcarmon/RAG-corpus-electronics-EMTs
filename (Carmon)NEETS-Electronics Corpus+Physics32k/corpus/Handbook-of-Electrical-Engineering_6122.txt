The equipment that can contribute to voltage collapse must also be more carefully modeled. Simple imped-
ance  models  for  loads  (
)  are  no  longer  adequate.  An  improvement  can  be  obtained  by
replacing  the  (mathematical)  power  2  in  the  equations  by  more  suitable  values.  Along  with  the  induction
machine models, the load characteristics can be further reÔ¨Åned by including saturation effects.
