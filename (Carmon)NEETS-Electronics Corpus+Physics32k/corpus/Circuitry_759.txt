Pressing the switch causes the bistable to change 
state.  The  bistable  then  remains  in  that  state  until 
the  switch  is  depressed  a  second  time.  If  desired, 
the complementary outputs provided by the bistable 
may be used to good effect by allowing the unused 
output 
to  drive  an  LED.  This  will  become 
illuminated whenever the Q output is high.
