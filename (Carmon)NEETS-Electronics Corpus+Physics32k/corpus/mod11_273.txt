SOLID-STATE MICROWAVE DEVICES are becoming increasingly widespread in microwave 
equipment with new developments almost daily. Most of the currently available solid-state devices are 
two-terminal diodes with the capability to generate or amplify microwave energy. Many of the solid-state 
devices, such as the TUNNEL DIODE and the BULK-EFFECT DIODE, apply the property of 
NEGATIVE RESISTANCE to amplify microwave signals or generate microwave energy. A 
characteristic curve illustrating the negative-resistance property of the tunnel diode is shown at the right.
