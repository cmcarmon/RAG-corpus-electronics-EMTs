The basic fusion splicing apparatus consists of two fixtures on which the fibers are mounted and two
electrodes. Figure 4-13 shows a basic fusion-splicing apparatus. An inspection microscope assists in the
placement of the prepared fiber ends into a fusion-splicing apparatus. The fibers are placed into the
apparatus, aligned, and then fused together. Initially, fusion splicing used nichrome wire as the heating
element to melt or fuse fibers together. New fusion-splicing techniques have replaced the nichrome wire
with carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers, electric arcs, or gas flames to heat the fiber ends, causing them to fuse
together. The small size of the fusion splice and the development of automated fusion-splicing machines
have made electric arc fusion (arc fusion) one of the most popular splicing techniques in commercial
applications.
