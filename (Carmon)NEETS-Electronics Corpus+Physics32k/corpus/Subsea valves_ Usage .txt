Subsea valves are used in sub-marine environments, which can range in depth from shallow water (usually down to a depth of 75 meters) to deep water (down to 3500 meters). Various industries use subsea valves, with the oil and gas sector accounting for the majority, where there is a need to move material from, to, or below the seabed.
