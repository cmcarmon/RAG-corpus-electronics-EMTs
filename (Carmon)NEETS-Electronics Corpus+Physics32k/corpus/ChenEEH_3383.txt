Therefore, the optimal power ﬂow problem becomes the solu-
tion of equations 8.17 through 8.20. In large-scale power
system formulations, it is very difﬁcult to ﬁnd an exact solu-
tion to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions. It is quite often sufﬁcient
to ﬁnd a suboptimal solution using heuristic optimization
algorithms. In recent history, excellent progress has been
made in the development of such heuristic algorithms.
