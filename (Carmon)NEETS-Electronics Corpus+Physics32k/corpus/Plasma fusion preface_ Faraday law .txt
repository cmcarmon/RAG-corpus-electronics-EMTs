states the emf-induction due to magnetic flux change.
And the relationship

{\displaystyle N\phi =LI}

leads back to my first formulas.
Viewing these equations, one has both B and E 90 degrees out of phase.
Considering the differential version of Faraday's law we have

{\displaystyle \nabla XE=-{\frac {dB}{dt}}}

which also states the direction of it all.
But we all know that for induction to happen the moving conductor has to cut the lines of force.
So this is by definition a TEM-wave.
The speed of the (circulating) charge need however to be non-constant (otherwise no induction can be made) which means that we have to accelerate the charge by for instance heat.
Considering

B


=
ℏ


{\displaystyle mvr_{B}=\hbar }

from below we note that v is constant within the Bohr radius.
So the only way of increasing the speed of the electron is to move it up to another shell.
In other words, linear thermal radiation cannot be achieved by heating.
Planck's law of radiation must be due to another phenomenon, which probably is vibration of the nuclei and/or electron.
Or perhaps the Bohr model is just too simple?
Apart from the Bohr restriction, the conclusion must be that every accelerated charge like above give rise to TEM.
A free accelerated or decelerated charge might suit even better for this reasoning. In this case it is more obvious that there are no spectral lines when it comes to thermal radiation and this is because of the "linear" speed states while adding kT.
