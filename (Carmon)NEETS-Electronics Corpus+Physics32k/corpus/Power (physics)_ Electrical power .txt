The instantaneous electrical power P delivered to a component is given by




P
(
t
)
=
I
(
t
)
⋅
V
(
t
)



{\displaystyle P(t)=I(t)\cdot V(t)\,}

where
P(t) is the instantaneous power, measured in watts (joules per second)
V(t) is the potential difference (or voltage drop) across the component, measured in volts
I(t) is the current through it, measured in amperes
If the component is a resistor with time-invariant voltage to current ratio, then:




P
=
I

{\displaystyle P=I\cdot V=I^{2}\cdot R={\frac {V^{2}}{R}}\,}

where

{\displaystyle R={\frac {V}{I}}\,}

is the resistance, measured in ohms.
