Hence the complete circuit with the left half replaced by its Th√©venin equiv-
alent is as shown in Figure 3.89e. Now the voltage across R3 for the various
values of R3 can be found by inspection. It should be noted that the Norton
equivalent would have been just as effective in this problem. Also note that the
circuit constraints imposed by the definitions of Rt, isc, and voc often make the
calculations of these parameters very easy, even in complicated networks.
