 Q19. A 2-volt, peak-to-peak, ac input signal is applied to the input of the circuit described in Q18.
When the signal is at its maximum positive value, 2.5 milliamperes flows through the tube.
When the input is at its maximum negative value, conduction through the tube decreases to .5
milliamperes.
