When we draw wires connecting points in a circuit, we usually assume those wires have
negligible resistance. As such, they contribute no appreciable effect to the overall resistance
of the circuit, and so the only resistance we have to contend with is the resistance in the
components. In the above circuits, the only resistance comes from the 5 Ω resistors, so that is
all we will consider in our calculations. In real life, metal wires actually do have resistance (and
so do power sources!), but those resistances are generally so much smaller than the resistance
present in the other circuit components that they can be safely ignored. Exceptions to this
rule exist in power system wiring, where even very small amounts of conductor resistance can
create signiﬁcant voltage drops given normal (high) levels of current.
