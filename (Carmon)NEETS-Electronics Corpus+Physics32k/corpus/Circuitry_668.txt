Using a digital multi-range meter 
 
Digital  multi-range  meters  offer  a  number  of 
significant  advantages  when  compared  with  their 
more  humble  analogue  counterparts.  The  display 
fitted to a digital multi-range meter usually consists 
of a 3½-digit seven-segment display O the ½ simply 
indicates that the first digit is either blank (zero) or 
1.  Consequently,  the  maximum  indication  on  the  
2 V range will be 1.999 V and this shows that the 
instrument  is  capable  of  offering  a  resolution  of  
1 mV on the 2 V range (i.e. the smallest increment 
in  voltage  increment  that  can  be  measured  is  
1 mV). The resolution obtained from a comparable 
analogue meter would be of the order of 50 mV, or 
so,  and  thus  the  digital  instrument  provides  a 
resolution  that  is  many  times  greater  than  its 
analogue counterpart. 
 Figure  14.15  shows  the  controls  and  display 
provided by a simple digital multi-range meter. The 
mode switch and range selector allow you to select 
from  a
