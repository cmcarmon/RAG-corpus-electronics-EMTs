Equation 6.91 can be extended to arbitrary situations when the
surrounding objects are at different physical temperatures
T (u, f), or the objects can be modeled with noise-equivalent
temperatures Te(u, f). This will relate pdn(u, f) to T (u, f) or
Te(u, f). Then, using equation 6.89 Ter can be related to the
surrounding temperature proÔ¨Åle Te(u, f) via Dg (u, f):
