In  the  DRC  number  system  the  complementation  constant  is  C  =  r n  –  1.  Modulo  addition  in  this  case  is
performed by subtracting r n and adding 1. It turns out that this operation can be performed by simply passing
the  operands  through  an  adder  and  feeding  the  carry-out  from  the  most  signiﬁcant  digit  position  into  the
carry-in at the least signiﬁcant digit position. This is also called addition with end-around carry.
