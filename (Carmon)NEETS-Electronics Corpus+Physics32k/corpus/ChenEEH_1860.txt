Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer signal-
ing protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating multi-
media sessions (voice, video, or data) with either one or more
participants (Johnston, 2000; Schulzrinne and Rosenburg,
2000; Arora and Jain, 1999). SIP does not deﬁne what a session
is; this is deﬁned by the content carried opaquely in SIP
messages. To establish a multimedia session, SIP has to go
through the following stages.
