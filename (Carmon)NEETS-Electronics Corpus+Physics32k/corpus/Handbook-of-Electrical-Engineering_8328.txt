Level-Sensitive Scan Design (LSSD). Level-sensitive scan design [Eichelberger and Williams, 1978] imposes
strict rules on clock signal usage and allows implementing sequential behavior to be implemented only using
the shift-register latch (SRL). In the Ô¨Årst place, by not allowing any feedback involving combinational circuit
elements  alone,  the  LSSD  approach  prevents  timing  failures  that  might  be  present  in  purely  asynchronous
designs. Furthermore, rigid clocking rules are stated in order to prevent SRL data inputs from changing while
the clock pulse(s) is (are) transitioning. Hence, the digital circuit is separated into two sections: (1) a robust
(i.e., level-sensitive) multi-input/multi-output combinational circuit and (2) a set of SRL elements with which
sequential  behavior  is  implemented.  In  addition  to  their  normal  system  interconnections  each  SRL  is  also
connected to its two neighboring SRLs to form a shift-register structure. The serial shift input and shift output
signals are labeled scan-in and scan-out, respectively, and treated as primary input/output terminals. Figure 85.13
