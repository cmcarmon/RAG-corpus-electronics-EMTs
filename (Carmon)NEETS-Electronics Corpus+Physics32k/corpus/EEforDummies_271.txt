Reading into fixed resistors
The attractive rainbow colors adorning most fixed resistors serve a purpose 
beyond catching your eye. Color‐coding identifies the nominal value and toler-
ance of most resistors; the others are drab and boring, and have their values 
stamped on them. The color code starts near the edge of one side of the resis­
tor and consists of several stripes, or bands, of color. Each color represents a 
number, and the position of the band indicates how you use that number.
