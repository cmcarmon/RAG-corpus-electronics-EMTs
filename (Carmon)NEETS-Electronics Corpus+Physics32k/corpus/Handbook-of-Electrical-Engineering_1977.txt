Descriptions of various CAD systems can be found in the following references. The description of the FIRST
system can be found in the article “A Silicon Compiler for VLSI Signal Processing,” by P. Denyer et al. in the
Proceedings  of  the  ESSCIRC  conference  held  in  Brussels  in  September  1982  (pages  215–218).  The  Cathedral
system has been described in R. Jain et al., “Custom Design of a VLSI PCM-FDM Transmultiplexor from System
Speciﬁcations to Circuit Layout Using a Computer Aided Design System,” published in IEEE Journal of Solid
State Circuits in February 1986 (pages 73–85). The Lager system has been described in “An Integrated Automatic
Layout  Generation  System  for  DSP  Circuits,”  by  J.  Rabaey,  S.  Pope,  and  R.  Brodersen,  published  in  the  July
1985 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Computer Aided Design (pages 285–296). The description of the MARS
Design System can be found in C.-Y. Wang and K.K. Parhi, “High-Level DSP Synthesis Using MARS System,”
