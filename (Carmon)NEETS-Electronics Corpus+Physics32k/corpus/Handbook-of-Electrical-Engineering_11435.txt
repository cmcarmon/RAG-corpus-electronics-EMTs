New  applications  for  gamma-ray  spectroscopy  have  emerged.  The  HPGe  detector  industry  has  recently
supplied  over  100  detectors  each  to  two  different  experimental  facilities  (GAMMASPHERE  in  the  U.S.,  and
EUROBALL in Europe), where they were arranged spherically in a modular fashion around the target of an
ion accelerator to study the decay of nuclei from excited states of high angular momentum.
