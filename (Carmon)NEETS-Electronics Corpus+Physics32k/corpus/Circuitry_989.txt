logic 
expressions  for  two  variables  and  their  Karnaugh 
maps is illustrated in Fig. A8.25 whilst Fig. A8.26 
shows  how  the  basic  logic  functions,  AND,  OR, 
NAND  and  NOR,  can  be  plotted  on  Karnaugh 
maps. 
  Adjacent  cells  within  a  Karnaugh  map  may  be 
grouped  together  in  rectangles  of  two,  four,  eight, 
etc.  cells  in  order  to  simplify  a  complex  logic 
expression.  Taking 
for 
example,  the  two  groups  of  two  adjacent  cells  in 
the Karnaugh map correspond to A or B, as shown 
in Fig. A8.27.  We thus conclude that:
