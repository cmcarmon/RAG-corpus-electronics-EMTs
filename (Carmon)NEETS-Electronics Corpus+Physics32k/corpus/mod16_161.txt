The Wheatstone bridge is widely used for precision measurements of resistance. The circuit diagram
for a Wheatstone bridge is shown in figure 1-5. Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are precision, variable resistors.
The value of Rx is an unknown value of resistance that must be determined. After the bridge has been
properly balanced (galvanometer G reads zero), the unknown resistance may be determined by means of a
simple formula. The galvanometer (an instrument that measures small amounts of current) is inserted
across terminals b and d to indicate the condition of balance. When the bridge is properly balanced, no
difference in potential exists across terminals b and d; when switch S2 is closed, the galvanometer
reading is zero.
