Nodal  analysis  applies  KCL to  ﬁnd  unknown  voltages  in  a  given
circuit,  while  mesh  analysis  applies  KVL to  ﬁnd  unknown  currents.
Mesh  analysis  is  not  quite  as  general  as  nodal  analysis  because  it  is
only  applicable  to  a  circuit  that  is  planar. A planar  circuit  is  one  that
can  be  drawn  in  a  plane  with  no  branches  crossing  one  another;  oth-
erwise  it  is  nonplanar. A circuit  may  have  crossing  branches  and  still
be  planar  if  it  can  be  redrawn  such  that  it  has  no  crossing  branches.
For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) has two crossing branches, but
it can be redrawn as in Fig. 3.15(b). Hence, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a)
is planar. However, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 is nonplanar, because there
is no way to redraw it and avoid the branches crossing. Nonplanar cir-
cuits  can  be  handled  using  nodal  analysis,  but  they  will  not  be  con-
sidered in this text.
