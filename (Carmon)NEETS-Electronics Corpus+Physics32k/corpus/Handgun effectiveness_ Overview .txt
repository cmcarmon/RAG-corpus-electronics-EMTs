Most handgun projectiles have significantly lower energy than centerfire rifles. What they lack in power, they make up for it in light weight, small size, concealability and practicality. The lack of power they possess, and caliber/bullet effectiveness, are widely debated topics with growing experimental research among civilians, law enforcement, ammunition companies, and the military. Factors that can influence handgun effectiveness include handgun design, bullet types and bullet capabilities (e.g. wound mechanisms, penetration, velocity).
