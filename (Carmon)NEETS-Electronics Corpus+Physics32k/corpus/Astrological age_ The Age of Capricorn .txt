The Age of Capricorn will follow the Age of Aquarius approximately 2150 years after the beginning of the Age of Aquarius, but the actual date for the start of the Age of Capricorn depends upon which system is used to calculate the length of an age and which system is applied to mark the start of the Age of Aquarius. There is no consensus on these matters but in broad terms, the Age of Capricorn can be expected to arrive somewhere from around the year 3500 to 4600 CE.
