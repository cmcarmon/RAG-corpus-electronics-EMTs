Road traffic collisions generally fall into one of four common types:

Lane departure crashes, which occur when a driver leaves the lane they are in and collide with another vehicle or a roadside object. These include head-on collisions and run-off-road collisions.
Collisions at junctions include rear-end collision and angle or side impacts.
Collisions involving pedestrians and cyclists
Collisions with animals
Other types of collision may occur. Rollovers are not very common, but lead to greater rates of severe injury and death. Some of these are secondary events that occur after a collision with a run-off-road crash or a collision with another vehicle.
If several vehicles are involved, the term 'serial crash' may be used. If many vehicles are involved, the term 'major incident' may be used rather than 'pile up'.
