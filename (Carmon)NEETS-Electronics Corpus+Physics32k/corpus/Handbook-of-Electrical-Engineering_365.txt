Power and energy: Consider  an  electrical  source  connected  at  a  pair  of  terminals  to  an  otherwise  isolated
network. Power, denoted by p, is the time rate of change in the energy delivered to the network by the
source. This can be expressed as p = vi, where v, the voltage across the terminals, is the energy expended
per  unit  charge  in  moving  the  charge  between  the  pair  of  terminals  and  i,  the  current  through  the
terminals, is the time rate of charge motion.
