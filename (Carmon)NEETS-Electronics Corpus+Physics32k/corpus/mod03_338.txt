Post-type fuseholders are made for cartridge fuses. The post-type fuseholder is much safer because
the fuse and fuse connections are covered with insulating material. The disadvantage of the post-type
fuseholder is that the fuse must be removed to visually check for an open. The post-type fuseholder has a
cap that screws onto the body of the fuseholder. The fuse is held in this cap by a spring-type connector
and, as the cap is screwed on, the fuse makes contact with the body of the fuseholder. When the cap and
fuse are removed from the body of the fuseholder, the fuse is removed from the circuit and there is no
danger of shock or short circuit from touching the fuse.
