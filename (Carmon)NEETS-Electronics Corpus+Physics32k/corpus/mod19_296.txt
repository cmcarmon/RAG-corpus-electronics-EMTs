Two NCB codes are assigned for the United States, 00 and 01. Code 00 identifies all FSNs (11-digit 
federal stock numbers used prior to NSNs) assigned prior to 31 March 1975. Code 01 identifies the 
numbers assigned after that time. The NCBs must be included and be correct, or the material may be 
rejected or you may receive the wrong material.
