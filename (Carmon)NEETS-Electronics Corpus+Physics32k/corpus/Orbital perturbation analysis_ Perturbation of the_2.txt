Rather than applying (1) and (2) on the partial derivatives of the orbital elements eccentricity and argument of perigee directly one should apply these relations for the eccentricity vector. First of all the typical application is a near-circular orbit. But there are also mathematical advantages working with the partial derivatives of the components of this vector also for orbits with a significant eccentricity.
Equations (60), (55) and (52) of the Kepler orbit article say that the eccentricity vector is
where
from which follows that

(Equations (18) and (19) of the Kepler orbit article)
The eccentricity vector is by definition always in the osculating orbital plane spanned by

and

{\displaystyle {\hat {t}}}
and formally there is also a derivative
