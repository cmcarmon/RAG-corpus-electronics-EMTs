Lempel–Ziv Coding
The  Lempel–Ziv  algorithm  [Ziv  and  Lempel,  1978]  is  a  universal  coding  procedure  that  does  not  require
knowledge  of  the  source  statistics  and  yet  is  asymptotically  optimal.  The  basic  idea  of  the  algorithm  is  to
construct a table or dictionary of frequently occurring strings and to represent new strings by pointing to their
preﬁxes in the table. We ﬁrst parse the string into sequences that have not appeared so far. For example, the
