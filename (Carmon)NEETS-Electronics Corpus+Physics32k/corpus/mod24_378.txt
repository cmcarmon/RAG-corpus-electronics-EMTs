Core diameter and NA mismatch have a greater effect on intrinsic coupling loss than the other types
of fiber mismatches. In multimode fiber connections, the coupling loss resulting from core diameter
mismatch, NA mismatch, and refractive index profile difference depends on the characteristics of the
launching fiber. Coupling loss from core diameter mismatch results only if the launching fiber has a
larger core radius (a) than the receiving fiber. Coupling loss from NA mismatch results only if the
launching fiber has a higher NA than the receiving fiber. Coupling loss from refractive index profile
difference results only if the launching fiber has a larger profile parameter ( a ) than the receiving fiber.
Q14. List six types of fiber mismatches.
Q15. Does coupling loss from refractive index profile difference result when the receiving fiber has a
