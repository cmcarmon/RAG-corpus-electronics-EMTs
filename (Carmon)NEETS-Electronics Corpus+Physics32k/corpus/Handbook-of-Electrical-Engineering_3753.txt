In the ﬁrst range, wave propagates as in a waveguide, using the earth’s surface and the ionosphere as boundaries.
Attenuation is comparatively low, and hence VLF propagation is useful for long-distance worldwide telegraphy
and submarine communication. In the second frequency range, the availability of increased bandwidth makes
standard AM broadcasting possible. Propagation in this band is by means of surface wave due to the presence
of  the  ground.  The  third  range  is  useful  for  long-range  broadcasting  services  via  sky  wave  reﬂection  and
refraction by the ionosphere. Basic problems in this band include ﬂuctuations in the ionosphere and a limited
usable frequency range. Frequencies above 50 MHz allow for line-of-sight space wave propagation, FM radio
and TV channels, radar and navigation systems, and so on. In this band, due consideration must be given to
mul-
reﬂection from the ground, refraction by the troposphere, scattering by atmospheric hydrometeors, and
