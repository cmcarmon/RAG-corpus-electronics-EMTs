Neglecting the stator resistance in Equation (13.2.9) results in negligible error for most induction
motors. If Xm of the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 13.2.6 is sufﬁciently large that the shunt
(cid:7)(cid:7)
1 are then equal to
branch need not be considered, calculations become much simpler; R
R1 and Xl1, respectively; also, V1a is then equal to V1.
The general shape of the torque–speed or torque–slip characteristic is shown in Figure 13.1.6,
in which the motor region (0 < S ≤ 1), the generator region (S < 0), and the breaking region (S
> 1) are included for completeness. The performance of an induction motor can be characterized
by such factors as efﬁciency, power factor, starting torque, starting current, pull-out (maximum)
torque, and maximum internal power developed. Starting conditions are those corresponding to
S = 1.
