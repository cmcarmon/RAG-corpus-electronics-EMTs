To apply an emergency tourniquet made from something like a neckerchief, wrap the material once 
around the limb and tie an overhand knot; place a short stick on the overhand knot and tie a square knot 
over it. Then twist the stick rapidly to tighten the tourniquet. The stick may be tied in place with another 
strip of material. Figure 1-8 shows how to apply a tourniquet.
