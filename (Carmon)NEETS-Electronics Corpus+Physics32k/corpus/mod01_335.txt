The zinc combines with the sulfuric acid to form zinc sulfate and hydrogen. The zinc sulfate 
dissolves in the electrolyte (sulfuric acid and water) and the hydrogen appears as gas bubbles around the 
carbon electrode. As current continues to flow, the zinc gradually dissolves and the solution changes to 
zinc sulfate and water. The carbon electrode does not enter into the chemical changes taking place, but 
simply provides a return path for the current.
