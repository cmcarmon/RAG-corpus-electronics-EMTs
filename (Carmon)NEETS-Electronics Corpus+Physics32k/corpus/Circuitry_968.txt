(a)   We  can  use  the  graph  to  determine  the 
crossing  point  (the  intercept) on  the  drain 
 
(ID)
current 
 
axis.  This  occurs  when  
ID = 10 mA.
 
(b)   The slope (or gradient) of the graph is  found 
 
by taking a small change in drain current and 
dividing it by a corresponding small change in 
 
gate-source  voltage.  In  order  to  do  this  we 
 
have drawn a triangle on the graph at the point 
 
where VGS = R2 V. The slope of the  graph is 
 
found  by  dividing  the  vertical  height  of  the 
 
triangle  (expressed  in  mA)  by  the  horizontal 
 
length  of  the  triangle  (expressed  in  V).  From 
 
Fig. A8.10 we can see that the vertical height 
 
 
of   triangle  is  2  mA  whilst  its  horizontal 
length  is  1  V.  The  slope  of  the  graph  is  thus 
 
given by 2 mA/1 V = 2 mA/V.
