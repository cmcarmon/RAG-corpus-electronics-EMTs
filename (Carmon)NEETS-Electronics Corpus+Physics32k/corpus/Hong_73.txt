A classic diode circuit is a peak detector shown in circuit a, Figure 6.6, having a 
diode and a capacitor in series.  On the upswing of the signal, when the source voltage 
(VS) is 0.7 V greater than the capacitor voltage (VC), the diode has a small resistance and 
V
. On the downswing of the signal, the diode has a large resistance and the 
C
previous peak voltage is held on by the capacitor. If the signal is kept consistently lower 
than the capacitor voltage, then the capacitor voltage decays with a time constant that is 
equal  to  the  reverse  diode  resistance  multiplied  by  the  capacitance.  Since  the  reverse 
diode resistance can be as large as 109 ohms, the decay time constant may be undesirably 
long. If this is the case, a large resistor can be added in parallel with the capacitor, as 
shown in circuit b, Figure 6.6, to set the decay time constant as
