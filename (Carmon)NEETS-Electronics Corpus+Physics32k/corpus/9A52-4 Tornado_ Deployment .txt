Russian ground forces received about 30 Tornado-G systems in 2011, replacing the BM-21 Grad. The improved Tornado-S was upgraded with the special GLONASS satellite navigation system used in the Smerch missile system. The Tornado-S has guided rocket rounds enabling it to fire out to 72 miles (120 km). The Tornado-S has a longer range and increased effectiveness, due to the use of new warhead payloads and a reduced launch readiness time of just three minutes. The Tornado-G entered series production in 2013. The system entered service with the Russian armed forces in 2014. The Tornado-S approved for service in Julyâ€“August 2016 and started its serial deliveries.
