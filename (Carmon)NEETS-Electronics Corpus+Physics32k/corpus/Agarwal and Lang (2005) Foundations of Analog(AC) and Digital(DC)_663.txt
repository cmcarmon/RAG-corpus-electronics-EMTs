(cid:1) This chapter introduced nonlinear circuits and their analyses. Nonlinear
circuits include one or more nonlinear devices, which display a nonlinear
v i relationship. Nonlinear circuits obey KVL and KCL and can be solved
using the basic KVL/KCL method or the node method. Note that the
KVL/KCL method or the node method do not make any assumptions
about linearity.
