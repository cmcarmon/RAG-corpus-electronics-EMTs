(7.57)
where it has been assumed that iOUT = 0. Equations 7.53 through 7.57 may now be
solved to determine vOUT as a function of vIN1 and vIN2. We will do so in two steps.
First, Equations 7.53 through 7.56 will be solved to determine iD2 as a function of vIN1
and vIN2. Then, Equation 7.57 will be used to determine vOUT from iD2.
