One specialized method of generating an emf utilizes the characteristics of certain ionic crystals such
as quartz, Rochelle salts, and tourmaline. These crystals have the remarkable ability to generate a voltage
whenever stresses are applied to their surfaces. Thus, if a crystal of quartz is squeezed, charges of
opposite polarity will appear on two opposite surfaces of the crystal. If the force is reversed and the
crystal is stretched, charges will again appear, but will be of the opposite polarity from those produced by
squeezing. If a crystal of this type is given a vibratory motion, it will produce a voltage of reversing
polarity between two of its sides. Quartz or similar crystals can thus be used to convert mechanical energy
into electrical energy. This phenomenon, called the PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT, is shown in figure 1-20.
Some of the common devices that make use of piezoelectric crystals are microphones, phonograph
cartridges, and oscillators used in radio transmitters, radio receivers, and sonar equipment. This method of
generating an emf is not suitable for applications having large voltage or power requirements, but is
widely used in sound and communications systems where small signal voltages can be effectively used.
