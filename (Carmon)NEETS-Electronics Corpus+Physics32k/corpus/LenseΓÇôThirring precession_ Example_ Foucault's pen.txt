To get a sense of the magnitude of the effect, the above can be used to compute the rate of precession of Foucault's pendulum, located at the surface of the Earth.
For a solid ball of uniform density, such as the Earth, of radius

The direction of the spin of the Earth may be taken as the z-axis, whereas the axis of the pendulum is perpendicular to the Earth's surface, in the radial direction. Thus, we may take

At this rate a Foucault pendulum would have to oscillate for more than 16000 years to precess 1 degree. Despite being quite small, it is still two orders of magnitude larger than Thomas precession for such a pendulum.
The above does not include the de Sitter precession; it would need to be added to get the total relativistic precessions on Earth.
