actual electrical systems utilizing compensating capacitors, either type of resonance or a combination of both
can occur if the resonant point happens to be close to one of the frequencies generated by harmonic sources
in the system. The outcome can be the ï¬‚ow of excessive amounts of harmonic current or the appearance of
excessive harmonic overvoltages, or both. Possible effects of this are excessive capacitor fuse operation, capacitor
failure, overheating of other electrical equipment, or telephone interference.
