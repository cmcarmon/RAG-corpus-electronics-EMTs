The differential amplifier is used extensively in in-
tegrated circuits and electronic equipment in general. 
It is used to amplify and/or compare the amplitudes of 
both DC and AC signals. It is possible to connect one or 
more differential amplifiers together to obtain a higher 
overall gain. In some cases, the differential amplifier is 
used as a first stage, with conventional amplifiers used 
in succeeding circuits. Because of their versatility and 
temperature stability, differential amplifiers are the 
most important type of direct-coupled amplifier.
