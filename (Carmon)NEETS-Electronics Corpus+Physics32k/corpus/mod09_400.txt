Notice that the basic flip-flop, illustrated in figure 3-18, has two inputs and two outputs. The inputs 
are coupled to the bases of the transistors and the outputs are coupled from the collectors of the 
transistors. Think of the flip-flop as two common-emitter amplifier circuits, where the output of one 
amplifier is connected to the input of the other amplifier, and vice-versa. Point (D) is connected through 
R4 to C4 to point (A). Point (A) is the input to transistor Q1. By the same token, point (C), which is the 
output of Q1, is connected through R3 and C3 to the input (point (B)) of transistor Q2.
