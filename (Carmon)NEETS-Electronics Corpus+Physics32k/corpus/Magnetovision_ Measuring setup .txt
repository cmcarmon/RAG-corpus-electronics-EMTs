Magnetovision measuring stand consists of a magnetometer, X-Y or X-Y-Z movement mechanism and data processing and visualization system. Following modes of magnetovision signal acquisition are possible:
magnetometer moves in the measurement area (e.g. over tested object)
tested object moves against the magnetometer
array of magnetic field sensors is used
