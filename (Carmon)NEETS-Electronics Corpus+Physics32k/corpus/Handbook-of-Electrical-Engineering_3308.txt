The output current is linear with incident power plus a constant dark current due to thermal generation of
carriers; h is the quantum efﬁciency.
Avalanche Photodiodes
When the reverse bias of a photodiode is increased to near the breakdown voltage, carriers in the depletion
region can be accelerated to the point where they will excite electrons from the valence band into the conduction
band, creating more carriers. This current multiplication is called avalanche gain, and typical gains of 50 are
available. Avalanche diodes are specially designed to have uniform junction regions to handle the high applied
ﬁelds.
