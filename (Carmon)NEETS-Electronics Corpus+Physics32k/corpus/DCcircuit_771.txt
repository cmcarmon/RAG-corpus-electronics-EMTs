For general purpose electronics work, the multimeter reigns supreme as the instrument of
choice. No other device is able to do so much with so little an investment in parts and elegant
simplicity of operation. As with most things in the world of electronics, the advent of solid-
state components like transistors has revolutionized the way things are done, and multimeter
design is no exception to this rule. However, in keeping with this chapter’s emphasis on analog
(”old-fashioned”) meter technology, I’ll show you a few pre-transistor meters.
