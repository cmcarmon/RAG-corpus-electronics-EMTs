At T3 the input signal and capacitor voltage are again series aiding. Thus, the output voltage felt 
across R1 and D1 is again +50 volts. During T3 and T4, C1 discharges 2 volts through R1. Notice that 
circuit operation from T3 to T4 is the same as it was from T1 to T2. The circuit operation for each square-
wave cycle repeats the operation which occurred from T2 to T4.
