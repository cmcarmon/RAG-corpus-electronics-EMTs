Citizens are a primary source of information in the real-time earthquake detections. EMSC involves them in earthquake response by collecting in-situ information (questionnaires, picturesâ€¦) on the earthquake impact directly from the witnesses. Consequently, these developments provide rapid constraints on the earthquake impact by involving the citizens in the response and draw an efficient way to raise seismic risk awareness.
