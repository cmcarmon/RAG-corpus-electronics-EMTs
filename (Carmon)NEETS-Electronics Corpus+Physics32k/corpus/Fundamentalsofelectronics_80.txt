can be greater than one or less than one. If less than one, the ampliﬁer actually attenuates. A real-world
example of an ampliﬁer is your home stereo. You control the gain by turning the volume control.
2.6.3 Delay
A system serves as a time delay (Figure 2.14) when the output signal equals the input signal at an earlier
time.
