This chapter explores how integrated circuits came to be, 
identifies the three major IC flavors, and dissects the inner 
workings of one variety — digital ICs. You get a look at how comput-
ers and other digital devices manipulate two distinct voltage levels to pro-
cess information using special rules known as logic. Next up is an explanation 
of how to read an IC to understand what the heck it does (because you can’t 
tell by its cover) and how to connect it for use in circuits. Finally, you get a 
closer look at three best‐selling ICs, what they do, and how you can use them 
to create your own innovative circuits.
