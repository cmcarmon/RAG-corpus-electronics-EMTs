where t represents the time to breakdown, A is a constant, DH is the activation energy of the aging process, T
is the absolute temperature, and k is the Boltzmann constant (1.38 3 10–23 J K–1). If the log t versus 1/T plot
represents a straight line that is obtained when the insulation aging is accelerated at various temperatures above
the  operating  temperature,  extrapolation  of  the  line  to  the  operating  temperature  may  yield  a  rudimentary
estimate of the aging time or the service life that can be anticipated from the insulation system when operated
under normal temperature and load conditions. Deviations from straight-line behavior are indicative of more
than  one  thermal  aging  mechanism;  for  example,  a  polymeric  insulation  will  exhibit  such  behavior  when
thermally stressed beyond its melting or phase transition temperature.
