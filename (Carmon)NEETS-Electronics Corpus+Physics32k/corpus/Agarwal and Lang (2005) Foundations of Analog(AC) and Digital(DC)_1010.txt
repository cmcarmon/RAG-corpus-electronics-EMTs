Let us take a closer look at the behavior of the amplifier for the given input
bias voltage by determining the corresponding output operating point. For a
given input operating point voltage VIN, we can determine the operating point
output voltage VO from Equation 7.14, and the operating point output current
ID from the MOSFET SCS model given in Equation 7.8. Substituting for the
circuit parameters in Equation 7.14 we get
