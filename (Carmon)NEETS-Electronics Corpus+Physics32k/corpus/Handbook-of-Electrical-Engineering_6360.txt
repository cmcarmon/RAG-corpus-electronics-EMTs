In addition to audio extraction, DAB receivers likely will be capable of decoding auxiliary data. This data
can be used in conjunction with the user interface to control receiver functions, or for a completely separate
purpose. A typical user interface could contain a data display screen in addition to the usual receiver tuning
and audio controls. This data screen could be used to obtain information about the programming, news reports,
sports scores, advertising, or any other useful data sent by the station or an originating network. Also, external
interfaces could be used to provide a software link to personal computer systems.
