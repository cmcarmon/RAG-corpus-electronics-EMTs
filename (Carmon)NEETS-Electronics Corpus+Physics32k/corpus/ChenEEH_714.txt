Deﬁning such a memory system based on a high-level spe-
ciﬁcation is far from trivial when taking real-time constraints
into account. High-level tools will have to support the deﬁn-
ition of the memory system (see section 2.6). An accurate data-
transfer scheduling is needed to derive a suitable memory
architecture in the given (timing) constraints. This as such is
