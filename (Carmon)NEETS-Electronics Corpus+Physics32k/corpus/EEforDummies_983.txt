▶✓ Battery or solar‐cell symbol: Each of the battery symbols in Figure 14-4 
represents a DC source with two leads. Technically, the battery symbol 
that includes two parallel lines (the first symbol for battery) represents 
a single electrochemical cell; the symbol with multiple pairs of lines (the 
second symbol) represents a battery (which consists of multiple cells).
Many schematics (including those in this book) use the symbol for a cell 
to represent a battery.
Each symbol includes a positive terminal (indicated by the larger hori-
zontal line) and a negative terminal. The polarity symbols (+ and –) and 
nominal voltage are usually shown next to the symbol. The negative
