The transient response 
is the component of the total response that
dies out with time. The form of the transient response is the same as the
form  of  the  solution  obtained  in  Section  8.3  for  the  source-free  circuit,
given by Eqs. (8.14), (8.21), and (8.26). Therefore, the transient response
vt (t)
for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:
