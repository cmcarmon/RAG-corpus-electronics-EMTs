The next stage is to price electricity not only on time but also on the place of use (nodal pricing). Thus, the
cost of transportation of the energy from the producer to the user is included in the price. This can be a serious
problem  at  present  when  power  is  exchanged  between  utilities.  It  will  become  increasingly  common  as  the
individual electricity producers and users set up contractual agreements for supply and use. A major problem
at present is the lack of common agreement as to whether nodal pricing is the most appropriate mechanism
for a deregulated wholesale electricity market. Clariﬁcation will occur as the structure of the industry changes.
Nodal pricing also takes into account other commercial and ﬁnancial factors. These include the pricing of
both generation and transmission constraints, the setting of a basis for transmission constraint hedges and for
the economic dispatch of generation. The programs must be designed to give both the suppliers and consumers
of energy the full opportunity costs of the operation of the power system.
