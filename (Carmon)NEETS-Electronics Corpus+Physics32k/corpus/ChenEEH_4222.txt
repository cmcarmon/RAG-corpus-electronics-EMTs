With the IEEE 802.4 Token Passing Bus Protocol, each station
is assigned a logical position in an ordered sequence in a
physical bus topology and a logical ring. Each station knows
its logical preceding and successor addresses. A token frame
regulates the access of medium. When Ô¨Ånishing a transmission
or when time elapses, a token is passed to the next station in
the logical ordering. Each station can only transmit a frame
when it holds a token except when a non token-holding station
responds to a poll or a request for acknowledgment. There are
several token maintenance events described in the following
paragraphs.
