In summary, in a series-LC circuit with a source voltage that is below the resonant frequency (100 
kHz in the example), the resultant reactance (X), and therefore impedance, is higher than at resonance. In 
addition current is lower, and the voltage drops across the reactances are lower. All of the above follow in 
sequence due to the fact that XC is greater than XL at any frequency lower than the resonant frequency.
