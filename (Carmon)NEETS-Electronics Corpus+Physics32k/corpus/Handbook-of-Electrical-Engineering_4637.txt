It is often desirable for transducers to be directional. Directional sound sources are needed in diagnostic and
therapeutic  medical  ultrasonics,  for  acoustic  depth  sounders;  and  to  reduce  the  power  requirements  and
reverberation in active sonars, etc. Directional microphones are useful to reduce unwanted noise (e.g., to pick
up the voice of a speaker and not the audience); directional hydrophones or hydrophone arrays increase signal-
to-noise and aid in target localization. One way to achieve directionality is to make the radiating surface large.
