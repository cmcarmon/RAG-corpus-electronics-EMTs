In particle physics, the available energy is the energy in a particle collision available to produce new matter from the kinetic energy of the colliding particles. Since the conservation of momentum must be held, a system of two particles with a net momentum may not convert all their kinetic energy into mass - and thus the available energy is always less than or equal to the kinetic energy of the colliding particles. The available energy for a system of one stationary particle and one moving particle is defined as:

{\displaystyle E_{t}}

{\displaystyle E_{k}}
is the total energy of the moving particle,





m

{\displaystyle m_{t}}
is the mass of the stationary target particle,





m

k




{\displaystyle m_{k}}
is the mass of the moving particle, and




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light.
