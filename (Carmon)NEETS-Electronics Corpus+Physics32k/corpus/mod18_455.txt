Devices used to determine the basic carrier frequency of a radar transmitter are the ELECTRONIC 
FREQUENCY COUNTER, the WAVEMETER, and the ECHO BOX. One or more of these devices may 
be included in a special RADAR TEST SET designed for a specific system or type of radar. Radar test 
sets quite often consist of several types of test equipment. This combination of test equipments enables 
both transmitter and receiver performance checks to be carried out with one test instrument. Electronic 
frequency counters, frequency meters, and wavemeters are discussed in NEETS, Module 16, Introduction 
to Test Equipment. The echo box is discussed in the next section. The specific equipments and procedures 
required to measure the frequency of any radar system are found in the associated system technical 
manuals and related PMS documents.
