F. It has only a radio frequency oscillator, which is modulated by the sensor signal. For this reason,
â€“40 to 212
it is not suitable for static strain measurements and must be used for dynamic strain measurements only. It
has a frequency response to 25,000 Hz or greater. A static strain signal transmitted by this device will drift. It
is provided with self-contained rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Pins protruding through the epoxy case
are used for all electrical connections. Only one screw adjustment is provided, and this is used to set the radio
frequency.
