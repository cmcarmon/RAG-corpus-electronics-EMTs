The point at which the gas ionizes can be controlled more accurately by inserting a grid into the gas
diode. A negative voltage on the grid can prevent electrons from going to the plate, even when the plate
voltage is above the normal firing point. If the negative-grid voltage is reduced to a point where a few
electrons are allowed through the grid, ionization takes place. The grid immediately loses control, because
the positive ions gather about the grid wires and neutralize the grid’s negative charge. The gas triode then
acts as a diode. If the grid is made much more negative in an effort to control the plate current, the only
effect is that more ions collect about the grid wires—tube continues to conduct as a diode. Only by
removing the plate potential or reducing it to the point where the electrons do not have enough energy to
produce ionization will tube conduction and the production of positive ions stop. Only after the
production of positive ions is stopped will the grid be able to regain control.
