A variety of leakage currents are steadily ï¬‚owing through
various parts of the transistor, including a subthreshold cur-
rent through the channel. Those currents are small, but they
are becoming increasingly important in low-power applica-
tions. Not only do many circuits need to operate under very
low current drains, but subthreshold currents are also getting
relatively larger as transistor sizes shrink.
