The modern kilogram has its origins in the pre-French Revolution days of France. In 1790 an influential proposal by Talleyrand called for a new system of units, including a unit of length derived from an invariable length in nature, and a unit of mass (then called weight) equal to the mass of a unit volume of water. In 1791, the Commission of Weights and Measures, appointed by the French Academy of Sciences, chose one ten-millionth of the quarter meridian as the unit of length, and named it metre. Initially a provisional value was used, based on the old meridian measurement by Lacaille (1740).
In 1793 the commission defined the unit of mass as a cubic decimetre of distilled water at 0 °C, and gave it the name grave. Two supplemental unit names, gravet (0.001 grave), and bar (1000 grave), were added to cover the same range as the old units, resulting in the following decimal series of units: milligravet, centigravet, decigravet, gravet, centigrave, decigrave, grave, centibar, decibar, bar. The mass of a unit volume of water at 0 °C was accurately determined by Lavoisier and Haüy (18841 grains per cubic provisional decimetre). A prototype of the grave was made in brass.
