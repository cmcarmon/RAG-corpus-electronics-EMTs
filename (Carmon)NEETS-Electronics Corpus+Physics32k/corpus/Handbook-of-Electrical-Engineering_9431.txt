[Hamming,  1950].  The
Hamming distance 
between any two binary words is the number of bit positions in which the two words differ.
For example, the binary words 0000 and 0001 differ in only one position and therefore have a Hamming distance
of 1. The binary words 0000 and 0101, however, differ in two positions; consequently, their Hamming distance
Clearly, if two words have a Hamming distance of 1, it is possible to change one word into the other simply
. 
is 2
by modifying one bit in one of the words. If, however, two words differ in two bit positions, it is impossible
to transform one word into the other by changing one bit in one of the words.
