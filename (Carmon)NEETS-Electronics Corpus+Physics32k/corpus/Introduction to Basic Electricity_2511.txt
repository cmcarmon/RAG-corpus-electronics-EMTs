The cathode-ray tube consists of three parts: a 
phosphor screen, deflection plates, and an electron 
gun (Figure 22-8). The phosphor	screen emits light 
when struck by electrons. The electron gun gener-
ates the electron beam that strikes the screen. As the 
electron beam approaches the screen, the deflection	
plates change the direction of the electron beam as it 
approaches the screen. The horizontal deflection plate 
is attached to the sweep generator, which moves the
