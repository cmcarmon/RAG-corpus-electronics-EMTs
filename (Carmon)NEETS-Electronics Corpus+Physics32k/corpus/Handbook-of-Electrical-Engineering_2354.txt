Boundary Conditions.  Boundary conditions have a large effect on the ﬁnal solution, and their speciﬁc choice
is  a  very  important  issue.  For  ohmic  contacts,  inﬁnite  recombination  velocities  and  space  charge  neutrality
conditions are assumed. Therefore, for a p-type material, the ohmic boundary conditions take the form
