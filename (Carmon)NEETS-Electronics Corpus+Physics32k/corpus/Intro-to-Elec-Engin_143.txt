1.2.30 Consider a pair of coupled coils as shown in Figure
1.2.10 of the text, with currents, voltages, and
polarity dots as indicated. Show that the mutual
inductance is L12 = L21 = M by following
these steps:
(a) Starting at time t0 with i1(t0) = i2(t0) = 0,
maintain i2 = 0 and increase i1 until, at time
t1, i1(t1) = I1 and i2(t1) = 0. Determine
the energy accumulated during this time. Now
maintaining i1 = I1, increase i2 until at time
t2, i2(t2) = I2. Find the corresponding energy
accumulated and the total energy stored at
time t2.
