Self-control can be applied to all variable-frequency converters, whether they are voltage-
source inverters, current-source inverters, current-controlled PWM inverters, or cycloconverters.
Rotor position sensors, i.e., rotor position encoders with optical or magnetic sensors, or armature
terminal voltage sensors, are used for speed tracking. In the optical rotor position encoder shown
in Figure 16.1.25 for a four-pole synchronous machine, the semiconductor switches are Ô¨Åred at

a frequency proportional to the motor speed. A circular disk, with two slots S
inner radius and a large number of slots on the outer periphery, is mounted on the rotor shaft.
Four stationary optical sensors P1 to P4 with the corresponding light-emitting diodes and photo
transistors are placed as shown in Figure 16.1.25. Whenever the sensor faces a slot, an output
