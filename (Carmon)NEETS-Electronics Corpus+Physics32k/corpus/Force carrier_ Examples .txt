The electromagnetic force can be described by the exchange of virtual photons.
The nuclear force binding protons and neutrons can be described by an effective field of which mesons are the excitations.
At sufficiently large energies, the strong interaction between quarks can be described by the exchange of virtual gluons.
Beta decay is an example of an interaction due to the exchange of a W boson, but not an example of a force.
Gravitation may be due to the exchange of virtual gravitons.
