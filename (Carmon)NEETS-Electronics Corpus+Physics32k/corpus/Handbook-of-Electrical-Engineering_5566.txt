Further Considerations
Generators are not the only sources in the system. All rotating machines
are capable of contributing to fault current, at least momentarily. Syn-
chronous  and  induction  motors  will  continue  to  rotate  due  to  inertia
and function as sources of fault current. The impedance used for such
machines is usually the transient reactance X¢d or the subtransient X¢¢d,
depending on protective equipment and speed of response. Frequently
motors smaller than 50 hp are neglected. Connecting systems are mod-
eled with their Thévenin equivalents.
