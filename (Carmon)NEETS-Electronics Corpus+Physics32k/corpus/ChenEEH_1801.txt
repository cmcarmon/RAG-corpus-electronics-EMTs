Packet Scheduling
If differential treatment is to be provided in the network, then
FIFO scheduling, traditionally used in routers, must be re-
placed by sophisticated queuing disciplines like priority
queuing and weighted fair queuing. Priority queuing pro-
vides different queues for different trafﬁc types. Every queue
has an associated priority in which it is served. Queues with
lower priority are served only when there are no packets in all
the higher priority queues. One disadvantage of priority
queuing is that it might lead to starvation of some low-priority
ﬂows.
