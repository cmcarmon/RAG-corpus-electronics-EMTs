With the diversity of possible antenna designs, a collection of design rules of thumb are useful. The directivity
and gain for a few popular antenna designs are given in Table 38.1. Directivity is the ratio of the maximum to
average radiation intensity. The gain is deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of the maximum radiation intensity from the subject
antenna  to  the  maximum  radiation  intensity  from  a  reference  antenna  with  the  same  power  input.  The
directivity, D, and gain, G, of an antenna can be expressed as
