Step 3 is to troubleshoot the circuit to find out 
what is wrong with the circuit, causing it not to work 
properly, and then determine what has to be done. 
Electronics technicians use their eyesight to look for 
trouble. If a component receives excess current, it may 
split open or char. Technicians also smell for burnt 
insulations from components that receive excess cur-
rent, such as transformers, coils, or components with 
insulated leads. They listen for sounds such as a snap, 
crackle, or pop that indicate loose wires, bridged con-
nections, or frying components. They touch compo-
nents to determine whether they are running hot or 
cold. An electronics technicianâ€™s senses of sight, smell, 
hearing, and touch are only a beginning. To solve more 
difficult problems, meters and oscilloscopes are used 
once the problem is located in a specific part of the cir-
cuit. Use this data to isolate and repair the defect(s).
