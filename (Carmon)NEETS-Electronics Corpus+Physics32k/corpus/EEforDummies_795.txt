Battery holders make series connections between batteries for you while 
holding multiple batteries in place. Some battery holders provide red 
and black leads for access to the total voltage; others, such as the one in 
Figure 12-5, provide PP3 connector snaps so you can attach a battery clip and 
access the total voltage across the clip’s red and black leads.
