has a similar distribution for almost any type of natural images.
Then, in fact, the transformation we performed, consisting of
taking differences between adjacent pixels, has effectively re-
duced the redundancy of the original image. In addition, be-
cause the smaller values are much more probable than the larger
ones, if we use a variable-length code to represent the coefÔ¨Å-
