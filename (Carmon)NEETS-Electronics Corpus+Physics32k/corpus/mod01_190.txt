When a length of metal, such as copper, is heated at one end, electrons tend to move away from the
hot end toward the cooler end. This is true of most metals. However, in some metals, such as iron, the
opposite takes place and electrons tend to move TOWARD the hot end. These characteristics are
illustrated in figure 1-21. The negative charges (electrons) are moving through the copper away from the
heat and through the iron toward the heat. They cross from the iron to the copper through the current
meter to the iron at the cold junction. This device is generally referred to as a THERMOCOUPLE.
