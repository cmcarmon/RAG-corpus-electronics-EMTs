For engineers in industry, communication is key to promotability.
Consider  the  result  of  a  survey  of  U.S.  corporations  that  asked  what
factors  inﬂuence  managerial  promotion.  The  survey  includes  a  listing
of 22 personal qualities and their importance in advancement. You may
be  surprised  to  note  that  “technical  skill  based  on  experience”  placed
fourth  from  the  bottom.  Attributes  such  as  self-conﬁdence,  ambition,
ﬂexibility,  maturity,  ability  to  make  sound  decisions,  getting  things
done  with  and  through  people,  and  capacity  for  hard  work  all  ranked
higher. At the top of the list was “ability to communicate.” The higher
your  professional  career  progresses,  the  more  you  will  need  to  com-
municate. Therefore, you should regard effective communication as an
important tool in your engineering tool chest.
