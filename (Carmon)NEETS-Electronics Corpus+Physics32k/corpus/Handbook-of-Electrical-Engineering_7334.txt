Phase-locked loops are used in many applications including frequency synthesis, modulation, demodulation,
and  clock  recovery.  A  frequency  synthesizer  is  a  PLL  that  uses  a  programmable  divider  in  the  feedback.  By
selecting various values of division ratio, several output frequencies may be obtained that are integer multiples
of the reference frequency (Fref). Frequency synthesizers are widely used in radio communications equipment
to obtain a stable frequency source that may be tuned to a desired radio channel. Since the output frequency
is an integer multiple of the reference frequency, this will determine the channel spacing obtained. The main
