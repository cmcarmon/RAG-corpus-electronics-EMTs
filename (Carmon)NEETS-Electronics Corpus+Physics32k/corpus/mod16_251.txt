The basic heterodyne meter (figure 2-9) is a calibrated variable oscillator, which heterodynes against
the frequency to be measured. Coupling is accomplished between the frequency meter and the output of
the equipment under test. (NOTE: This coupling should be in accordance with the step-by-step
procedures listed in the technical manual for the frequency meter.) The calibrated oscillator is then tuned
so that the difference between the oscillator frequency and the unknown frequency is in the af range. This
difference in frequency is known as the BEAT FREQUENCY. As the two frequencies are brought closer
to the same value, the tone in the headset will decrease in pitch until it is replaced by a series of rapid
clicks. As the process is continued, the clicks will decrease in rapidity until they stop altogether. This is
the point of zero beat; that is, the point at which the frequency generated in the oscillator of the frequency
meter is equal to the frequency of the unknown signal being measured.
