A third limitation caused by tube construction is TRANSIT TIME. Transit time is the time required 
for electrons to travel from the cathode to the plate. While some small amount of transit time is required 
for electrons to travel from the cathode to the plate, the time is insignificant at low frequencies. In fact, 
the transit time is so insignificant at low frequencies that it is generally not considered to be a hindering 
factor. However, at high frequencies, transit time becomes an appreciable portion of a signal cycle and 
begins to hinder efficiency. For example, a transit time of 1 nanosecond, which is not unusual, is only 
0.001 cycle at a frequency of 1 megahertz. The same transit time becomes equal to the time required for 
an entire cycle at 1,000 megahertz. Transit time depends on electrode spacing and existing voltage 
potentials. Transit times in excess of 0.1 cycle cause a significant decrease in tube efficiency. This 
decrease in efficiency is caused, in part, by a phase shift between plate current and grid voltage.
