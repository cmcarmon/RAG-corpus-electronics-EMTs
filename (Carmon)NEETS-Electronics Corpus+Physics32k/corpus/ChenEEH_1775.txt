In this section, we further analyze why the current Internet,
having the best-effort delivery model, is inadequate in sup-
porting trafﬁc requirements of multimedia trafﬁc streams and
justify the need for enhancements to this basic model. We also
point out the research approaches that have been adopted to
make best-effort Internet more accommodating to real-time
multimedia trafﬁc. To preserve the brevity of this chapter, we
do not discuss every such approach at length but provide
appropriate references for interested readers.
