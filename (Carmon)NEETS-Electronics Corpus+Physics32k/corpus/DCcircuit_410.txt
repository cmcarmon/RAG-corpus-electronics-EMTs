In like manner, numbers with many zero digits are not necessarily representative of a real-
world quantity all the way to the decimal point. When this is known to be the case, such a
number can be written in a kind of mathematical ”shorthand” to make it easier to deal with.
This ”shorthand” is called scientiﬁc notation.
