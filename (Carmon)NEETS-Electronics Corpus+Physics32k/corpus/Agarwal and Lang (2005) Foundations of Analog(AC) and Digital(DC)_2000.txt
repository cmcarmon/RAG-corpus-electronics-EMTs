Many physical systems can also be modeled as second-order resonant cir-
cuits. Because the injection of even miniscule amounts of energy at or near
the resonant frequency of a second-order resonant circuit can cause a massive
and sustained response, physical structures such as buildings and bridges are
carefully modeled and designed to avoid such responses. In fact, resonators
excited at their resonance can be viewed as energy accumulators in the sense
that they continuously extract and store energy from their excitation. In this
case, the only limit to the amplitude of their response is internal dissipation
or nonlinear behavior resulting from the stresses of large amplitude responses.
The most notorious case of such a response is the Tacoma Narrows Bridge dis-
aster. Alternating winds injected enough energy into the bridge structure at its
resonant frequency that the entire bridge entered into resonance and began to
sway back and forth and finally collapsed. Sections 14.5.2 and 14.6 will provide
more insight into this type of resonant behavior.
