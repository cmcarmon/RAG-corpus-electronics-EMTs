Our military forces increasingly rely on electrical and electronic equipment to help perform their
mission. The effectiveness of our tactical forces depends on many types of electronic systems, such as
communications systems, detection systems, and fire control systems. The reliability of such equipment is
determined by many factors; however, the primary factors are the quality of the equipment in use, the
availability of spare parts, and the ability of maintenance personnel to perform adequate maintenance.
