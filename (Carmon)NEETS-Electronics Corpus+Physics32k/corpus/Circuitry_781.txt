connections  present  in  a  circuit,  most  modern 
packages use an on-screen graphical representation 
of  the  circuit  on  test.  This,  in  turn,  generates  a 
netlist  (or  its  equivalent)  for  submission  to  the 
computational  engine  that  actually  performs  the 
circuit  analysis  using  mathematical  models  and 
algorithms. In order to describe the characteristics 
and  behaviour  of  components  such  as  diodes  and 
transistors,  manufacturers  often  provide  models  in 
the form of a standard list of parameters. 
  Most  programs  that  simulate  electronic  circuits 
use a set of algorithms that describe the behaviour 
of  electronic  components.  The  most  commonly 
used  algorithm  was  developed  at  the  Berkeley 
Institute  in  the  United  States  and  it  is  known  as
