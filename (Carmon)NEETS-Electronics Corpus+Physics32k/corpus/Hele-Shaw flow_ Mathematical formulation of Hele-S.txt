Let



x


{\displaystyle x}
,



y


{\displaystyle y}
be the directions parallel to the flat plates, and



z


{\displaystyle z}
the perpendicular direction, with



2
H


{\displaystyle 2H}
being the gap between the plates (at



z
=
±
H


{\displaystyle z=\pm H}
). When the gap between plates is asymptotically small




H
→
0
,



{\displaystyle H\rightarrow 0,\,}

the velocity profile in the



z


{\displaystyle z}
direction is parabolic (i.e. is a quadratic function of the coordinate in this direction). The equation relating the pressure gradient to the velocity is,

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {u} }={\mathbf {\nabla } }p{\frac {z^{2}-H^{2}}{2\mu }}\,}

where





u




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {u} }}
is the velocity,



p
(
x
,
y
,
t
)


{\displaystyle p(x,y,t)}
is the local pressure,



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the fluid viscosity.
This relation and the uniformity of the pressure in the narrow direction



z


{\displaystyle z}
permits us to integrate the velocity with regard to



z


{\displaystyle z}
and thus to consider an effective velocity field in only the two dimensions



x


{\displaystyle x}
and



y


{\displaystyle y}
. When substituting this equation into the continuity equation and integrating over



z


{\displaystyle z}
we obtain the governing equation of Hele-Shaw flows,
