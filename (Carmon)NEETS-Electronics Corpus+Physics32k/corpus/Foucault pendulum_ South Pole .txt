The experiment has also been carried out at the South Pole, where it was assumed that the rotation of the earth would have maximum effect at the Amundsenâ€“Scott South Pole Station, in a six-story staircase of a new station under construction. The pendulum had a length of 33 m and the bob weighed 25 kg. The location was ideal: no moving air could disturb the pendulum, and low air pressure reduced air resistance. The researchers confirmed about 24 hours as the rotation period of the plane of oscillation.
