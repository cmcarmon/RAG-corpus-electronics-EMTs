Figure 10.2 gives the engine speed variations and control
inputs. A step disturbance of 15 Nm is loaded to the system
after 20 engine cycles and unloaded after 150 engine cycles.
The integral term in the control law is discretized using the
trapezoidal rule with step size Dt ¼ 4 crankshaft degrees. The
plant is integrated using Euler’s rule with sampling time
T ¼ 32 crankshaft degrees. It is evident that the controller
maintains the idle speed at 611 RPM, and there is no steady-
state error. After the torque disturbance is added to the system,
the engine speed drops to 582 RPM, with a deviation of 29
RPM from the desired idle speed of 611 RPM. After the
disturbance is removed, the engine speed increases to 642
RPM, with a deviation of 41 RPM. The disturbance is com-
pletely rejected in a few engine cycles for both loading and
unloading cases (with residual oscillations due to the chatter-
ing in the spark advance). The controller thus has the capabil-
ity of disturbance rejection for a typical ‘‘bad’’ disturbance.
Note that the engine speed does not oscillate signiﬁcantly
although both of the control inputs have chattering character-
istics (physical actuators would, of course, not be able to re-
spond in this manner).
