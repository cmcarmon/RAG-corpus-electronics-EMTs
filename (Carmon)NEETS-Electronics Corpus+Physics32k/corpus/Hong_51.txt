A practical voltage source is modeled as an ideal voltage source in series with a 
small  source  resistance,  as  shown  in  Figure  4.1.  The  output  voltage  across  the  load 
resistance  is  attenuated  due  to  the  source  resistance  and  the  resulting  voltage  is 
determined by the resistive divider,
