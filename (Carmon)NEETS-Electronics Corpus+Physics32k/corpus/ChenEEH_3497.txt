Chapter 6 presents fundamental concepts of statistical signal
processing, which is an important aspect of signal processing.
It provides a brief summary of the principles of mathematical
statistics on which signal detection and estimation are based.
Signal detection and estimation are critical in extracting infor-
mation from signals in communication and control systems.
