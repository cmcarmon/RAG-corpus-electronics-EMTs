The ramping unit step function u(t; T ) can be differentiated to yield the unit-area
pulse function δ(t; T ) shown in Figure 9.43. This function becomes increasingly
narrow and tall as T approaches 0, but in doing so it maintains unit area, as
depicted in Figure 9.44. In the limit T → 0, δ(t; T ) becomes the unit impulse
(see the right-most graph in Figure 9.44, which we will simply denote by δ(t).
The unit impulse4 has several important properties for our purposes. These
