This means that a total of 7 milliamps is flowing from point A through R1 and R2. If 7 milliamps is
flowing from point A, then 7 milliamps must be flowing into point A. The 7 milliamps flowing into point
A flows through R3 causing 7 volts to be developed across R3. With point A at 0 volts and 7 volts
developed across R3, the voltage potential at Eout must be a - 7 volts. Figure 3-21 shows these voltages
and currents.
