Electromagnetic  interference  (EMI)  is  deﬁned  to  exist  when  undesirable  voltages  or  currents  are  present  to
inﬂuence adversely the performance of an electronic circuit or system. Interference can be within the system
(intrasystem), or it can be between systems (intersystem). The system is the equipment or circuit over which
one exercises design or management control.
