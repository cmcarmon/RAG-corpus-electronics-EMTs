MATLAB  was  developed  by  a  numerical  analyst  for  numerical  analysts.  Such  people  need,  and  MATLAB
provides,  only  one  data  structure,  the  complex  matrix.  It  is  a  credit  to  its  ﬂexibility  that  the  package  can  be
adapted to a control engineer’s needs by the careful use of convention and toolbox extensions (Fig. 112.6), but
the price paid is increased complexity.
