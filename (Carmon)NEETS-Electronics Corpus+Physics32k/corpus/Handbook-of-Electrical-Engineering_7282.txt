Cellular Band Systems
The ﬁrst system to appear in the cellular band in the United States was AMPS. This system provided user trafﬁc
channels of 30 kHz, as part of a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) scheme. In addition, this system
used the concept of frequency division duplexing (FDD) to provide different channels for an individual user
to  send  and  receive  trafﬁc.  This  system  used  analog  frequency-modulation  technology,  and  was  primarily
designed  to  provide  voice  service  only,  although  some  systems  do  exist  that  provide  data  services  through
AMPS. The ﬁrst public service began operation in the Chicago area in 1983.
