(cid:1) When the system is under-damped, the parameter ωd determines the rate
at which the states oscillate, and α determines the rate at which the states
decay. ω◦ is the oscillation frequency in the absence of damping. Intuitively,
Q determines the amount of ringing exhibited by the circuit, and is the
approximate number of cycles after which the energy in an RLC circuit can
be considered to have decayed to zero.
