The OTDR displays the backscattered and reflected optical signal as a function of length. The OTDR
plots half the power in decibels (dB) versus half the distance. Plotting half the power in dB and half the
distance corrects for round trip effects. By analyzing the OTDR plot, or trace, end users can measure fiber
attenuation and transmission loss between any two points along the cable plant. End users can also
measure insertion loss and reflectance of any optical connection. In addition, end users use the OTDR
trace to locate fiber breaks or faults.
