The  intent  of  this  section  is  to  present  topics  related  to  the  utilization  and  application  of  digital  devices.
Chapter 79 establishes the foundation for digital logic elements beginning with IC, logic gates, logical families,
bistable devices, and optical devices. Discussed in the next chapter are memory devices, which include integrated
circuits (RAM, ROM), disk systems, magnetic tape, and optical disks. Chapter 81 on logical devices discusses
switching algebra, logic circuits, registers, programmable arrays (PAL, FPGA), and arithmetic logic units.
