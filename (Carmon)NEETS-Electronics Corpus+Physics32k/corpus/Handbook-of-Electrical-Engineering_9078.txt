Other actuator designs use a stored energy approach where a preloaded leaf spring is held by a permanent
magnet until released by a “bucking coil” to counteract the static ﬂux. Also, experimental stacked piezoelectric
transducers have been investigated using high lever ratios (e.g., 30:1) which have operated at 3 kHz and above.
Synthetic ruby or ceramic wire guide holes are sometimes used to combat wear. Several hundred million cycles
lifetime operation for each wire is typically required for today’s devices.
