potential difference between its input terminals. The effect of the feedback connection from
output to inverting input is then to force the voltage at the inverting input to be equal to that at
the noninverting input. This is equivalent to stating that for an op amp with negative feedback,
vn
The voltage gain of the overall circuit of Figure E5.2.1(a) is called the closed-loop gain, because
the presence of a feedback connection between the output and the input constitutes a closed loop
as per the terminology used in the Ô¨Åeld of automatic control, which is presented in Section 16.2.
