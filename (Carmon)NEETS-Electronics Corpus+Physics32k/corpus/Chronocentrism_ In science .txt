The "Copernican time principle" is a temporal analog of the Copernican principle for space, which states that no spatial location is any more or less special of a frame of reference than any other spatial location (i.e. that our physical universe has no center). Some authors have extended this to also include that no point in time is any more or less special than any other point in time (e.g. in outdated steady-state theories), though this cannot be universally applied (e.g. the Big-Bang singularity is a special point in time that can be logically used as a frame of reference to date later events.)
