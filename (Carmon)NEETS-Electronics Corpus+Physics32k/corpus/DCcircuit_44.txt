It must be understood that not all conductive materials have the same level of conductivity,
and not all insulators are equally resistant to electron motion. Electrical conductivity is analo-
gous to the transparency of certain materials to light: materials that easily ”conduct” light are
called ”transparent,” while those that don’t are called ”opaque.” However, not all transparent
materials are equally conductive to light. Window glass is better than most plastics, and cer-
tainly better than ”clear” ﬁberglass. So it is with electrical conductors, some being better than
others.
