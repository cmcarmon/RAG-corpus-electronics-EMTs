A two-terminal network consisting of linear resistors and in-
dependent and dependent sources can be represented by an
equivalent circuit with a current source and a parallel resistor
as shown in Figure 1.16. In this Ô¨Ågure, IN is equal to the short
circuit current across terminals A and B, and RN is the
looking-in resistance measured across A and B after the inde-
pendent sources are deactivated. It is easy to see the following
relation between Thevenin equivalent circuit parameters and
the Norton equivalent circuit parameters:
