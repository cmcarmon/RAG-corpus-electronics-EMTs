TORQUE DIFFERENTIAL RECEIVER (TDR)â€”A type of differential synchro that takes
two electrical inputs, one to the rotor and one to the stator, and produces a mechanical
output. The output is the angular position of the rotor, which represents the algebraic sum or
difference of the two electrical inputs.
