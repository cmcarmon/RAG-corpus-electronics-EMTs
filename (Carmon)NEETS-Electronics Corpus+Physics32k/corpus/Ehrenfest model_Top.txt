The Ehrenfest model (or dog-flea model) of diffusion was proposed by Tatiana and Paul Ehrenfest to explain the second law of thermodynamics. The model considers N particles in two containers. Particles independently change container at a rate λ. If X(t) = i is defined to be the number of particles in one container at time t, then it is a birth-death process with transition rates

{\displaystyle H(t)=-\sum _{i}P(X(t)=i)\log \left({\frac {P(X(t)=i)}{\pi _{i}}}\right),}

is monotonically increasing (H-theorem). This is a consequence of the convergence to the equilibrium distribution.
