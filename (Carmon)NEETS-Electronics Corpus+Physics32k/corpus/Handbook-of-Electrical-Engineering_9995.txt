c the frequency
at  which  its  phase  shift  is  180(cid:176).  Performing  this  test  in  practice  may  prove  difﬁcult.  If  the  plant  has  a  linear
transfer function and the gain is adjusted too quickly, a large amplitude oscillation may start to build up. In
1984 Astrom and Hagglund [1984] suggested replacing the proportional control by a relay element to control
the amplitude of the oscillation. Consider therefore the feedback loop of Fig. 100.42 with n(x) an ideal relay,
Gc(s) = 1, and the plant with a transfer function G1(s) = 10/(s + 1)3. The C(a) locus, –1/N(a) = –ap/4h, and
the Nyquist locus G(jw) in Fig. 100.47 intersect. The values of a and w at the intersection can be calculated from
