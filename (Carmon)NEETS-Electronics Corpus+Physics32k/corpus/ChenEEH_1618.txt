Providing explanations that clarify the decision-making pro-
cess and justify recommendations is an integral component of
an expert system. It is one of the primary user requirements
(Dhaliwal and Benbasat, 1996; Ye and Johnson, 1995). The
explanation facility may be used by different users for different
reasons in different contexts. For example, novice users can use
the facility to ﬁnd more about the knowledge being applied to
solve a particular problem. Advanced users access it to make
sure that the system’s knowledge and reasoning process is
appropriate. Decision makers use the explanation facility be-
cause it aids them in formulating problems and models for
analysis. The context may be problem solving by end users,
knowledge-base debugging by knowledge engineers, or expert
system validation by domain experts and/or knowledge engi-
neers. Although explanations are commonly used by end-
users, they also play a signiﬁcant role in the development of
expert systems by offering enhanced debugging and validation
abilities. Most current expert system development shells and
environments include explanation tools.
