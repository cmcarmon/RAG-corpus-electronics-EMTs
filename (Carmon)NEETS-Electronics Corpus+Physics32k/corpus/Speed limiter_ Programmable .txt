European CitroÃ«n, Mercedes Benz, Peugeot, Renault as well as some Ford car and van models have driver-controlled speed limiters fitted or available as an optional accessory which can be set by the driver to any desired speed; the limiter can be overridden if required by pressing hard on the accelerator. The limiter may be considered as setting the maximum speed (with throttle kickdown to override it) easing the throttle to reduce speed, whereas cruise control sets the minimum speed (with the brake pedal to override it) pressing on the throttle to increase speed. The limiter may shift down through automatic gears to hold the maximum speed.
