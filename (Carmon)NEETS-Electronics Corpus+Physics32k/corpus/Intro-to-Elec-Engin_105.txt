By considering a constant voltage source (with a given internal resistance RS) connected to a
variable-load resistance RL, as shown in Figure E1.2.6(a), for a value of RL equal to RS given
by Equation (1.2.13), the maximum power transfer to the load resistance would occur when the
load resistance is matched with the source resistance.
