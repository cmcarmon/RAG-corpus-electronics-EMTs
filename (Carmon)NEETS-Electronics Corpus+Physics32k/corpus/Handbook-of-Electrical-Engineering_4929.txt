showing  that  the  spatial  change  in  the  phase  of  the  macroscopic  wavefunction  is  proportional  to  the  local
magnetic ﬂux. The structure described is known as a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and
can be used as a highly sensitive magnetometer by biasing it with current and measuring the resulting voltage
as a function of magnetic ﬂux. From this discussion, it is apparent that a duality exists in how ﬁelds interact
with  the  macroscopic  phase:  electric  ﬁelds  are  coupled  to  its  rate  of  change  in  time  and  magnetic  ﬁelds  are
coupled to its rate of change in space.
