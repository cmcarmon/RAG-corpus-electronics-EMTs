In 1 second the transmitter moves 360 feet and transmits 60 hertz. At the end of 1 second, the first
cycle of the transmitted signal reaches the observer, just as the sixtieth cycle is leaving the transmitter at
point P1. Under these conditions the 60 hertz emitted is located between the observer and point P1.
Notice that this distance is only 720 feet (1,080 minus 360). The 60 hertz is spread over the distance from
point P1 to the observer and has a wavelength of just 12 feet (720 divided by 60). To find the new
frequency, use the following formula:
