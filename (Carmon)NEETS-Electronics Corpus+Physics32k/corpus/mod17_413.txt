More than six channels (perhaps 24 or more) may be used. As we increase the number of channels, 
the width of each sample segment must be reduced. The problem with reducing the width of the pulse is 
that the bandwidth (bw) necessary for transmission is greatly increased. Decreasing the pulse width 
decreases the minimum required rise time of the sampling pulse and increases the required bandwidth. 
When you increase the number of channels, you increase the bw. The bw is also affected by the shape of 
the sampling pulse and the method used to vary the pulse.
