To sustain an electric current, a material must have charge carriers that are free to move.
There is some probability that an atom may eject a valence electron which is then free to
move in the material. The conductivity of a material is thus a function of the number of
free charge carriers per unit volume. Based on these probability densities it is common to
divide materials into three categories: conductors, semiconductors and insulators.
