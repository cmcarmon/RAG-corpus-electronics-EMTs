It is also because each branch voltage is traversed exactly once positively and once
negatively that summing Equations 2.13 through 2.16 yields 0 = 0. This in turn shows
that the four KVL equations are dependent. In general, a circuit with N nodes and B
branches will have Bâˆ’ N+ 1 loops around which independent applications of KVL can
be made. Therefore, while analyzing a circuit it is necessary to apply KVL only to these
loops, which will in total, traverse each branch at least once in the process.
