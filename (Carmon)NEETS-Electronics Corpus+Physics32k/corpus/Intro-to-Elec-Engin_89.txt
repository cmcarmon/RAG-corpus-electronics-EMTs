If the medium in the ﬂux path has a linear magnetic characteristic (i.e., constant permeability),
then the relationship between the ﬂux linkages λ and the current i is linear, and the slope of the
linear λ–i characteristic gives the self-inductance, deﬁned as ﬂux linkage per ampere by Equation
(1.2.26). While the inductance in general is a function of the geometry and permeability of the
material medium, in a linear system it is independent of voltage, current, and frequency. If the
inductor coil is wound around a ferrous core such as iron, the λ–i relationship will be nonlinear
and even multivalued because of hysteresis. In such a case the inductance becomes a function
of the current, and the inductor is said to be nonlinear. However, we shall consider only linear
inductors here.
