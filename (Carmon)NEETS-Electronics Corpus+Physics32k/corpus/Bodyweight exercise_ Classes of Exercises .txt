Bodyweight exercises are generally grouped into four rough classes: Push, which requires the individual to use pushing movements to direct the body against gravity; Pull, which requires the practitioner to use pulling to direct the body; Core, which involves contracting movements of the abdominal and back muscles; and Legs/Glutes, which involve movements of the legs and glutes to direct the individual's body against gravity.
