It is not worthwhile to carry out detailed calculations for these four cases. Once the basic properties described
here are understood, one should be able to make the calculations. Observe, however, that in the delta structure,
there is no neutral connection, so the phase voltages cannot be measured. The only voltages that can be measured
are the line-to-line or simply the line voltages. These are the differences of the phase voltages taken in pairs, as
is evident from Fig. 3.31.
