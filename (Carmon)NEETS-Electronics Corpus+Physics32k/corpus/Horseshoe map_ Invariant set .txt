If a point is to remain indefinitely in the square, then it must belong to a set Λ that maps to itself. Whether this set is empty or not has to be determined. The vertical strips V1 map into the horizontal strips H1, but not all points of V1 map back into V1. Only the points in the intersection of V1 and H1 may belong to Λ, as can be checked by following points outside the intersection for one more iteration.
The intersection of the horizontal and vertical stripes, Hn ∩ Vn, are squares that in the limit n → ∞ converge to the invariant set Λ. The structure of this set can be better understood by introducing a system of labels for all the intersections—a symbolic dynamics.
