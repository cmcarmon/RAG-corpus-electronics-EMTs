In special relativity, the proper distance between two spacelike-separated events is the distance between the two events, as measured in an inertial frame of reference in which the events are simultaneous. In such a specific frame, the distance is given by

{\displaystyle \Delta \sigma ={\sqrt {\Delta x^{2}+\Delta y^{2}+\Delta z^{2}}}}
,
where
Δx, Δy, and Δz are differences in the linear, orthogonal, spatial coordinates of the two events.
The definition can be given equivalently with respect to any inertial frame of reference (without requiring the events to be simultaneous in that frame) by

{\displaystyle \Delta \sigma ={\sqrt {\Delta x^{2}+\Delta y^{2}+\Delta z^{2}-c^{2}\Delta t^{2}}}}
,
where
Δt is the difference in the temporal coordinates of the two events, and
c is the speed of light.
The two formulae are equivalent because of the invariance of spacetime intervals, and since Δt = 0 exactly when the events are simultaneous in the given frame.
Two events are spacelike-separated if and only if the above formula gives a real, non-zero value for Δσ.
