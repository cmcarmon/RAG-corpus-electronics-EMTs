TIME-DIVISION.â€”With AM voice and tone communications, we want to transmit and receive for 
360 degrees of each sine wave. However, an audio signal may be transmitted and received satisfactorily 
by periodically sampling the signal. The sampling process yields a received signal like the one shown in 
figure 3-28. There is no limit to the maximum number of samples that may be made, but you must sample 
at least twice per cycle of audio to get satisfactory results. In practical systems, 2.4 samples per cycle are 
usually taken. This concept of sampling forms the basis for time-division multiplex (tdm) operation.
