. A 1-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) realization
on FPGA is presented in (Stone and Manalokos, 1998).
Both high-pass and low-pass ﬁlters are a six-tap bi-
orthogonal binary ﬁlter. The system consumes 90% of
an Altera EPF10K100GC503 whose capacity is equivalent
to 100.000 gates. The operating clock frequency is
20 MHz.
