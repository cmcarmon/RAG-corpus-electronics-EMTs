Three axes of degree (amplitude, time, and frequency) are important when considering varying 
frequency. The time-domain (amplitude versus time) plot is used to consider phase relationships and basic 
timing of the signal and is normally observed with an oscilloscope. The frequency-domain (amplitude 
versus frequency) plot is used to observe frequency response - the spectrum analyzer is used for this 
purpose. Figure 5-8 illustrates the differences between frequency- and time-domain plots. View A 
illustrates a three-dimensional coordinate of a fundamental frequency (f1) and its second harmonic (2f1) 
with respect to time, frequency, and amplitude. View B shows the time-domain display as it would be 
seen on an oscilloscope. The solid line, f1 + 2f1 is the actual display. The dashed lines, f and 2f1 are drawn 
to illustrate the fundamental and second harmonic frequency relationship used to formulate the composite 
signal f1 + 2f1. View C is the frequency-domain display as it would be seen on a spectrum analyzer. Note 
in view C that the components of the composite signal are clearly seen.
