Voltmeters can be constructed with several ranges by the use of a switch and internal resistors.
Figure 1-29 shows a voltmeter with a meter movement of 100 ohms and 1 milliampere full-scale
deflection with 5 ranges of voltage through the use of a switch. In this way a voltmeter can be used to
measure several different ranges of voltage.
