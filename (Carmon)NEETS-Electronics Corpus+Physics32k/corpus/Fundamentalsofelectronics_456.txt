Exercise 4.19
(Solution on p. 141.)
The Fourier series coeﬃcients for speech are related to the vocal tract’s transfer function only at
the frequencies k/T , k ∈ {1, 2, . . .}; see previous result (4.9). Would male or female speech tend to
have a more clearly identiﬁable formant structure when its spectrum is computed? Consider, for
example, how the spectrum shown on the right in Figure 4.16 would change if the pitch were twice
as high (≈ 300Hz).
