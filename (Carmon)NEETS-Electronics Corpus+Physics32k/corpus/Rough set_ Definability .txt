In general, the upper and lower approximations are not equal; in such cases, we say that target set



X


{\displaystyle X}
is undefinable or roughly definable on attribute set



P


{\displaystyle P}
. When the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., the boundary is empty),





P
¯


X
=


P
_


X


{\displaystyle {\overline {P}}X={\underline {P}}X}
, then the target set



X


{\displaystyle X}
is definable on attribute set



P


{\displaystyle P}
. We can distinguish the following special cases of undefinability:
Set



X


{\displaystyle X}
is internally undefinable if





P
_


X
≠
∅


{\displaystyle {\underline {P}}X\neq \emptyset }
and





P
¯


X
=

U



{\displaystyle {\overline {P}}X=\mathbb {U} }
. This means that on attribute set



P


{\displaystyle P}
, there are objects which we can be certain belong to target set



X


{\displaystyle X}
, but there are no objects which we can definitively exclude from set



X


{\displaystyle X}
.
