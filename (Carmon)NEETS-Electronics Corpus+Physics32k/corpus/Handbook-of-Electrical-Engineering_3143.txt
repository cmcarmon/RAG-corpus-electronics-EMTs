 is the ﬁring angle. The output voltage of a single-phase
bridge circuit is the same as that shown in Fig. 30.10. Various conﬁgurations of the single-phase bridge circuit
can be obtained if, instead of four SCRs, two diodes and two SCRs are used, with or without freewheeling diodes.
A three-phase full-wave converter consisting of six thyristor switches is shown in Fig. 30.12(a). This is the

positive half cycle of the voltages of the phases to which they are connected, and thyristors T2, T4, and T6 are
turned on during the negative half cycle of the phase voltages. The reference for the angle in each cycle is at
the crossing points of the phase voltages. The ideal output voltage, output current, and input current waveforms
are shown in Fig. 30.12(b). The output dc voltage is controlled by varying the ﬁring angle a. The average output
voltage under continuous current conduction operation is given by
