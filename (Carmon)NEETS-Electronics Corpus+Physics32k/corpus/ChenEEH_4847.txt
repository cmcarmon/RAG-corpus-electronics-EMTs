Next, consider real-time behavior of software applications.
While high-level languages do have function calls that seem to
imply real-time, the timings are not exact. For example, a
sleep(20) command implemented in a Java thread would seem
to make the thread pause for 20 msec. However, the thread may
actually sleep for 19 msec or 21 msec. This can be explained by
examining how an operating system on a processor handles
several tasks that are running concurrently (known as multi-
tasking or multithreading: the system must schedule a dedi-
cated processor time to each of these different tasks. As a result,
tasks are typically scheduled in a nondeterministic manner,
which gives rise to the resulting soft real-time behavior.
