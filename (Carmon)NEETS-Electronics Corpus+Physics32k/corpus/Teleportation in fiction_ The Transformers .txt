The Transformers introduced a character named Skywarp, a member of the Decepticon Air Force called the Seekers, who was capable of teleporting from place to place. Transformers also utilize a device called a "Space Bridge" to travel, usually from Cybertron to a planet in another solar system. Some Transformers like the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen iteration of Jetfire carry onboard Space Bridges.
