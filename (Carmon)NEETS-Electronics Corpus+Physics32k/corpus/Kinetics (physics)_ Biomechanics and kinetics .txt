One of the major components of kinetics is analyzing ones center of pressure. Center of pressure (COP) is often tested using a force plate in a biomechanics lab. Many scientists don't always have access to these expensive and unique equipment. Force plates can be any from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. Scientist and students today have turned to an alternative way, by using Nintendo Wii Balance Board system as a force plate. One 2014 San Diego State University study has shown a correlation of

for the center of pressure measured using the Balance Board compared to a gold standard measure. The students expect their results to find that ankle bracing will reduce sway and decrease ankle instability and falls. Postural sway is the measurement of the time and distance a subject spends away from an ideal center of pressure. Measurement of a subject's center of pressure has been used as a method of quantifying postural stability.Investigators have theorized that if ankle injuries cause differentiation and functional instability, a subject's postural sway should be altered.Bracing has been known to provide cutaneous afferent feedback in maintaining postural control. The feedback follows the same neurological pathways in which the external ankle brace enhances the replication of the joint position. Although some may argue that braces have a negative impact on sport performance, the effectiveness of their mechanical stability make them of high priority and necessity. Due to the high incidence of ankle injury, the control of stability and body sway remain of most importance in reduction of injury and better quality of life.
The term kinetics is also used to refer to chemical kinetics, particularly in chemical physics and physical chemistry. In such uses, a qualifier is often used or implied, for example: "physical kinetics", "crystal growth kinetics", and so on.
