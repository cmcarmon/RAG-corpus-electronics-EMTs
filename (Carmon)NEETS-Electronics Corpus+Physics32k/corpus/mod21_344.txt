Electrodynamic wattmeters are subject to errors arising from various factors, such as temperature 
and frequency characteristics and vibration. Heat through the control mechanism can cause the springs to 
lengthen and lose tension; as a result, deflection errors are produced. Figure 3-12 illustrates the 
mechanical equivalent of the electrodynamic wattmeter. Large currents within the circuit will also 
produce errors. Therefore, the maximum current range of electrodynamic wattmeters is normally 
restricted to about 20 amperes. When larger load currents are involved, a current transformer of suitable 
range is used in conjunction with the wattmeter. However, a current transformer cannot be used if the ac 
circuit under test contains a dc component.
