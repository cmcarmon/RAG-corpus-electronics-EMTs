In the picture above, the meter movement ”needle” is shown pointing somewhere around
35 percent of full-scale, zero being full to the left of the arc and full-scale being completely to
the right of the arc. An increase in measured current will drive the needle to point further
to the right and a decrease will cause the needle to drop back down toward its resting point
on the left. The arc on the meter display is labeled with numbers to indicate the value of the
quantity being measured, whatever that quantity is. In other words, if it takes 50 microamps
of current to drive the needle fully to the right (making this a ”50 µA full-scale movement”),
the scale would have 0 µA written at the very left end and 50 µA at the very right, 25 µA
being marked in the middle of the scale. In all likelihood, the scale would be divided into much
smaller graduating marks, probably every 5 or 1 µA, to allow whoever is viewing the movement
to infer a more precise reading from the needle’s position.
