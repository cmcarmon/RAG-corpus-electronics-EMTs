, which makes it possible for one who does
not have the necessary skills to create a custom simulation using a high-level language to develop a commu-
nication system simulation. Many simulation languages are available for both personal computers and work-
stations [Shanmugan, 1988]. While the use of these resources can speed simulation development, the user must
ensure that the assumptions used in developing the models are well understood and applicable to the problem
of interest. In choosing a dedicated language from among those that are available, one should select a language
that has an extensive model library, an integrated postprocessor with a wide variety of data analysis routines,
on-line help and documentation capabilities, and extensive error-checking routines.
