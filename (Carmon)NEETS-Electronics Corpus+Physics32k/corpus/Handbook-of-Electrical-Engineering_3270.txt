Critical Angle. When a light ray traveling in a medium is incident on a surface of a less dense medium, there
is an incidence angle q2, where sin q1 = 1. This is the critical angle; for light incident at angles greater than q2
the light is totally internally reﬂected as shown in Fig. 31.3(b). The critical angle is given by qc = sin–1(n1/n2).
