The  operation  of  these  pnpn  structures  can  be  illustrated  through  the  use  of  load  lines.  For  the  simplest
device, the load consists of a resistor and a power supply. In Fig. 79.28(b), we see that for small amounts of
light, the device will be at point A. Point A is in a region of high electrical impedance with little or no optical
output. As the input light intensity increases, there is no longer an intersection point near A and the device
