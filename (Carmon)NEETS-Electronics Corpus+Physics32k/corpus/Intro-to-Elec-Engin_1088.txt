Elementary Synchronous Machines
The polyphase synchronous machine operates with direct current supplied to the ﬁeld winding
(assumed to be on the rotor, which is usually the case) through two slip rings and with polyphase
alternating current supplied to the armature (assumed to be on the stator). The rotor mmf, which is
obtained from a dc source, is stationary with respect to the rotor structure. When carrying balanced
polyphase currents, as shown in Section 12.3, the armature winding produces a magnetic ﬁeld in
the air gap rotating at synchronous speed [Equation (12.2.9) or (12.2.10)], as determined by the
system frequency and the number of poles in the machine. But the ﬁeld produced by the dc rotor
winding revolves with the rotor. To produce a steady unidirectional torque, the rotating ﬁelds of
stator and rotor must be traveling at the same speed. Therefore, the rotor must turn precisely at
the synchronous speed. Such conditions satisfy the second possibility for the development of a
constant torque suggested in the discussion following Equation (12.4.32). The resulting physical
system is shown in Figure 13.1.2.
