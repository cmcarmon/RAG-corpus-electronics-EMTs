. A coarse-grained conÔ¨Ågurable cell performs more com-
plex word parallel arithmetic functions such as, addition
and multiplication, with simple bit-level logic functions.
Mostly, this RC architecture is organized in a 2-D array
of nanoprocessors with an arithmetic and logic unit
(ALU), a multiplier, an instruction RAM, a data RAM,
data registers, input registers, and an operand register.
Reported architecture examples include Garp (Callahan
