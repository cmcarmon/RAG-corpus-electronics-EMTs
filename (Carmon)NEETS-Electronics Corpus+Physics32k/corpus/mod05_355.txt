CAPACITOR-START MOTORâ€”A type of single-phase, ac induction motor in which a starting
winding and a capacitor are placed in series to start the motor. The values of Xc and R are such that
the main-winding and starting-winding currents are nearly 90 degrees apart, and starting torque is
produced as in a two-phase motor.
