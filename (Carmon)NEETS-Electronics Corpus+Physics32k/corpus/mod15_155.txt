Figure 1-30 shows how a synchro capacitor affects the operation of a control synchro system. In this 
figure, the capacitor is placed between the CX and the CT. Two current meters are also placed in the 
circuit to show the effect the capacitor has on stator current. The meter connected between the capacitor 
and the CT reads normal stator current, 32 milliamperes (mA). This current would normally flow in the 
stator of the CX if the synchro capacitor were not connected. The other meter reads 10 mA, which is what 
is left of the original stator current after the magnetizing current has been canceled by the synchro 
capacitor. By reducing the current drain on the transmitter, the sensitivity and accuracy of the system 
increase.
