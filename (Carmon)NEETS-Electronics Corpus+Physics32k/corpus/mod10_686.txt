Radiation from antenna 2 toward receiving location Y will reach antenna 1 after 1/4 cycle. The 
energy in antenna 1 was 1/4 cycle behind that of antenna 2 to begin with; therefore, the radiation from 
antenna 1 toward receiving point Y will be exactly 180 degrees out of phase with that of antenna 2. As a 
result, the radiation fields will cancel and there will be no radiation toward Y.
