The ability of a capacitor to store electrical energy 
depends on the electrostatic field between the plates 
and the distortion of the orbits of the electrons in the 
dielectric material. The degree of distortion depends 
on the nature of dielectric material and is indicated 
by its dielectric constant. A dielectric	constant is a 
measure of the effectiveness of a material as an insula-
tor. The constant compares the materialâ€™s ability to dis-
tort and store energy in an electric field to the ability 
of air, which has a dielectric constant of 1. Paper has a 
dielectric constant of 2 to 3; mica has a dielectric con-
stant of 5 to 6; and titanium has a dielectric constant of 
90 to 170.
