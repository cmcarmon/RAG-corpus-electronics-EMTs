Now, refer to view A of figure 4-39. This figure shows the schematic diagram of the same shunt 
voltage regulator as that shown in figure 4-38 with an increased input voltage of 20.1 volts. This increases 
the forward bias on Q1 to 0.8 volt. Recall that the voltage drop across CR1 remains constant at 5.6 volts. 
Since the output voltage is composed of the Zener voltage and the base-emitter voltage, the output voltage 
momentarily increases to 6.4 volts. At this time, the increase in the forward bias of Q1 lowers the 
resistance of the transistor allowing more current to flow through it. Since this current must also pass 
through RS, there is also an increase in the voltage drop across this resistor. The voltage drop across RS is 
now 13.8 volts and therefore the output voltage is reduced to 6.3 volts. Remember, this change takes 
place in a fraction of a second.
