One possible circuit arrangement is shown in figure 2-25. Letâ€™s look at the theory involved in
understanding this circuit. You can see a crystal in one leg of the bridge circuit. The secondary of the
input transformer (T1) is balanced to ground through the center tap connection. The crystal acts as a high
Q series resonant circuit. It allows signals within the immediate vicinity of resonance to pass through the
crystal to the output coil (L3). The desired signal appears between the center tap of L3 and ground.
