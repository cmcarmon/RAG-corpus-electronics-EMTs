To maximize the utility of the GCN system, GCN will make whatever modifications are necessary to incorporate and distribute GRB location information from new spacecraft and instruments as they become active. GCN will also expand its operations to include information about any astrophysical transients, including non-GRBs such as the extreme-ultraviolet transients detected by the ALEXIS spacecraft. Future spacecraft that will be distributing GRB locations via GCN include AGILE and Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope.
