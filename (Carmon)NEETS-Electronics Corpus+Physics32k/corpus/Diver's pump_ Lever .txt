Lever pumps have one or two cylinders, which are operated by rocking a beam with handles attached to its ends which is pivoted at the centre for a two cylinder pump, and at the end for a single cylinder pump. Vertical lever pumps with bell-crank operation were also made, usually for shallow water work. The piston rods are connected to the beam near the pivot. Upward movement of the pistons pulls the air into the cylinders through the inlet valves, and then downward movement pumps the air through the hose to the helmet of the diver in a single action pump. Cylinders, valves and outlet for air are usually made from brass for reliability.
