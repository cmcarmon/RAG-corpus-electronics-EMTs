For a general treatment, including analysis of clutter effects, Nathanson’s [1991] book is very good and generally
easy  to  read.  For  extensive  detail  and  speciﬁc  numbers  in  various  actual  cases,  Saunders  [1990]  gives  good
coverage. The treatment of millimeter-wave seekers by Piper [1987] is excellent, both comprehensive and easy
to read.
