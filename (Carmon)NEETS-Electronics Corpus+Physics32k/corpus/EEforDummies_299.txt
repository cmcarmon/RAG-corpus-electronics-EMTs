Resistors in series
When you combine two or more resistors (or resistances) in series, you con­
nect them end to end (as shown in Figure 5­13), so that the same current 
passes sequentially through each resistor. By doing this, you restrict the cur­
rent somewhat with the first resistor, you restrict it even more with the next 
resistor, and so forth. So the effect of the series combination is an increase in 
the overall resistance.
