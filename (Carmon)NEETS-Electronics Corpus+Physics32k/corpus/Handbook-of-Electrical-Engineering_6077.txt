harles  Steinmetz  (1865–1923)  came  to
the United States in 1889 from Breslau,
Germany, where he was a student at the
University  of  Breslau.  He  joined  the  inventor
Rudolf Eickemeyer in building electric appara-
tus at Yonkers, New York, and at age 27 he for-
mulated  the  law  of  hysteresis,  which  made  it
possible to reduce the loss of efﬁciency in elec-
trical  apparatus.  When  Eickemeyer’s  ﬁrm  was
bought by General Electric, Steinmetz joined the
new company, beginning a 31-year relationship
that ended only with his death.
