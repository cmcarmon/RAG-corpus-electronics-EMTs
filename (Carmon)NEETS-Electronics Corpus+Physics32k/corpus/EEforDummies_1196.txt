You can learn a lot about a particular IC by looking up its datasheet on the 
Internet or doing an Internet search for application notes about the part. 
These information sources tell you much more than just the pinout and power 
requirements for the ICs; they often provide sample circuits and tips on get-
ting the best performance from the chip. Projects in this chapter use the 555 
timer chip, the 4017 decade counter IC, and the LM386 audio amplifier chip.
