Since R1//R2 and R3//R4 are in series with each other, the current through those two sets
of equivalent resistances must be the same. Furthermore, the current through them must be
the same as the total current, so we can ﬁll in our table with the appropriate current values,
simply copying the current ﬁgure from the Total column to the R1//R2 and R3//R4 columns:
