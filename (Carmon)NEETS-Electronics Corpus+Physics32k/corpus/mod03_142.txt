In figure 1-27(A), a voltmeter (represented by R2) connected across a 10-ohm resistor with 10 volts
applied. The current through the voltmeter (R2) is .1 milliamperes. In figure 1-27(B), the voltage is
increased to 100 volts. Now, the current through the voltmeter (R2) is 1 milliampere. The voltage has
increased by a factor of 10 and so has the current. This illustrates that the current through the meter is
proportional to the voltage being measured.
