Another frequency-limiting factor is the LEAD INDUCTANCE of the tube elements. Since the lead 
inductances within a tube are effectively in parallel with the interelectrode capacitance, the net effect is to 
raise the frequency limit. However, the inductance of the cathode lead is common to both the grid and 
plate circuits. This provides a path for degenerative feedback which reduces overall circuit efficiency.
