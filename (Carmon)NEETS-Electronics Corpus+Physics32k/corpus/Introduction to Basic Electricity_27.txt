Current,	resistance,	and	voltage	are	the	3	representations	of	the	important
components	of	a	circuitâ€™s	system.	They	can	explain	how	electricity	enters,	then,
moves	from	1	point	to	another,	and	finally	exits.	Whether	the	path	of	electricity	is
rather	simple,	these	representations	remain	constant.	Apart	from	describing	the
electric	flow,	they	can	serve	as	indications	of	faults	(in	instances	when	a	circuit
fails	to	work).
