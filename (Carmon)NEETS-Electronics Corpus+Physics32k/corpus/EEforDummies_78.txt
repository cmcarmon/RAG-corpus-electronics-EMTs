The power equation is one of a handful of equations that you should really 
pay attention to because of its importance in keeping you from blowing 
things up. Every electronic part, or component, has its limits when it comes to 
how much power it can handle. If you energize too many electrons in a given 
component, youâ€™ll generate a lot of heat energy and you might fry that part. 
Many electronic components come with maximum power ratings so you can 
avoid getting into a heated situation. I remind you about the importance of 
power considerations in later chapters when I discuss specific components 
and their power ratings, as well as how to use the power equation to ensure 
that you protect your parts.
