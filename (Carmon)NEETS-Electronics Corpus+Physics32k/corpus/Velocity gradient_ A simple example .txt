Consider the velocity field of a fluid flowing through a pipe. The layer of fluid in contact with the pipe tends to be at rest with respect to the pipe. This is called the no slip condition. If the velocity difference between fluid layers at the centre of the pipe and at the sides of the pipe is sufficiently small, then the fluid flow is observed in the form of continuous layers. This type of flow is called laminar flow.
The flow velocity difference between adjacent layers can be measured in terms of a velocity gradient, given by



Δ
u

/

Δ
y


{\displaystyle \Delta u/\Delta y}
. Where



Δ
u


{\displaystyle \Delta u}
is the difference in flow velocity between the two layers and



Δ
y


{\displaystyle \Delta y}
is the distance between the layers.
