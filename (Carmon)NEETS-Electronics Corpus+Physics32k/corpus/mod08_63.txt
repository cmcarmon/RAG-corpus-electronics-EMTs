A video amplifier is an amplifier designed to amplify a band of frequencies from 10 Hz to 6 MHz. 
Because this is such a wide band of frequencies, these amplifiers are sometimes called WIDE-BAND 
AMPLIFIERS. While a video amplifier will amplify a very wide band of frequencies, it does not have the 
gain of narrower-band amplifiers. It also requires a great many more components than a narrow-band 
amplifier to enable it to amplify a wide range of frequencies.
