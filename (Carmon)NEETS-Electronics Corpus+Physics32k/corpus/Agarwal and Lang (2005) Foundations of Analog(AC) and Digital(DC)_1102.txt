Section 4.5 introduced the following notation to distinguish between total
variables, their average DC values, and their incremental excursions about the
average values. We will denote total variables with small letters and capital
subscripts, average DC values using all capitals, and incremental values using
all small letters. Thus, vI denotes the total input voltage, VI the DC offset, and
vi the incremental component. Since the total variable is the sum of the two
components, we have
