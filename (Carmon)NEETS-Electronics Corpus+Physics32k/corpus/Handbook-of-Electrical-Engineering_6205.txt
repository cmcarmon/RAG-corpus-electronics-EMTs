*When a station is already limited by interference from other stations to a contour of higher value than that normally protected
for its class, this higher-value contour shall be the established protection standard for such station. Changes proposed by Class A
and B stations shall be required to comply with the following restrictions. Those interferers that contribute to another station’s RSS
using the 50% exclusion method are required to reduce their contribution to that RSS by 10%. Those lesser interferers that contribute
to a station’s RSS using the 25% exclusion method but do not contribute to that station’s RSS using the 50% exclusion method may
make changes not to exceed their present contribution. Interferers not included in a station’s RSS using the 25% exclusion method
are permitted to increase radiation as long as the 25% exclusion threshold is not equaled or exceeded. In no case will a reduction
be required that would result in a contributing value that is below the pertinent value speciﬁed in the table.
