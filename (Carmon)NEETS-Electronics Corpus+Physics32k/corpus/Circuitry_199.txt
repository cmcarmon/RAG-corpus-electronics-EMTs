The  apparent  power  in  an  a.c.  circuit  is  the 
power which is apparently consumed by the circuit 
and is the product of the supply current and supply   
voltage (note that this is not the same as the power 
which is actually dissipated as heat). Hence: 
 
apparent power = IS Ã— VS
(Volt-Amperes) 
 
Hence
