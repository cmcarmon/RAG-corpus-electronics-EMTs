Triple transit echo (TTE): A multiple transit echo received at three times the main SAW signal delay time.
This echo is caused due to the bidirectional nature of SAW transducers and the electrical and/or acoustic
mismatch  at  the  respective  ports.  This  is  a  primary  delayed  signal  distortion  which  can  cause  ﬁlter
distortion, especially in bidirectional transducers and ﬁlters.
