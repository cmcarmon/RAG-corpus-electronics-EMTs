Analyzing  a  circuit  using  superposition  has  one  major  disadvan-
tage:  It  may  very  likely  involve  more  work.  If  the  circuit  has  three
independent  sources,  we  may  have  to  analyze  three  simpler  circuits
each providing the contribution due to the respective individual source.
However, superposition does help reduce a complex circuit to simpler
circuits  through  replacement  of  voltage  sources  by  short  circuits  and
of current sources by open circuits.
