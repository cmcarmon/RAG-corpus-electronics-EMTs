SEEDs
A  self-electro-optic  effect  device  (SEED)  is  a  multiple  quantum  well  semiconductor  optical  pin  device  and
forms  the  combination  of  a  photodiode  and  a  modulator.  It  can  operate  as  a  photodetector  where  incident
light will generate a photocurrent in a circuit. It can also act as a modulator where the light transmitted through
the device is varied by an applied voltage.
