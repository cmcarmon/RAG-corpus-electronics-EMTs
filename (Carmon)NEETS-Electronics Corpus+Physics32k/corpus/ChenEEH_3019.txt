prototype simulated and fabricated on 1.27-mm thick Duroid
(er Â¼ 10:2) measured 50% frequency bandwidth (4.17 to
6.94 GHz). FDTD simulation for a millimeter-wave version
indicates that a single quasi-Yagi antenna works from 41.6 to
70.1 GHz (51% bandwidth), which covers part of Q- and most
of the V-band.
