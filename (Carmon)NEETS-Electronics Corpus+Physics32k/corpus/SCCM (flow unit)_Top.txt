SCCM is Standard Cubic Centimeters per Minute, a flow measurement term indicating cm³/min at a standard temperature and pressure. The standard temperature and pressure vary according to different regulatory bodies. This unit is used to calculate the amount of gas or volume of gas that passes through a given point in a unit time. One example of standard conditions for the calculation of SCCM is defined as: Tn= 0 °C or 273K, Pn= 1.01 bar, (14.72 psia)
