A typical gamma-ray spectrum of a 60Co source taken with a coaxial HPGe detector is shown in Fig. 116.11.
The salient features are the full-energy peaks at 1.17 MeV and 1.33 MeV, and the lower-energy plateaus due to
incomplete energy absorption of Compton scattered gamma-rays. The peak-to-Compton ratio [15] is generally
40  to  100,  depending  on  the  size  and  quality  of  the  detector.  The  1.33-MeV  peak  is  shown  separately  in
Fig. 116.12. The energy resolution measured as the full width at half the peak maximum (FWHM) for typical
coaxial germanium detectors is between 1.6 KeV and 2.1 KeV for 1.33-MeV gamma-rays, again depending on
the  size  and  quality  of  the  detector.  The  variance  in  the  peak  L2  (FWHM =  2.35 Ã—  L,  L  being  the  standard
deviation  for  a  Gaussian  distribution)  can  be  divided  into  three  additive  components:  the  electronic  noise
2, and  a
component  LN
