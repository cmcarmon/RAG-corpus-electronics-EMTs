When ac is converted to pulsating dc, the d’Arsonval movement will react to the average value of the
pulsating dc (which is the average value of one-half of the sine wave). Another characteristic of using a
rectifier concerns the fact that the d’Arsonval meter movement is capable of indicating current in only one
direction. If the d’Arsonval meter movement were used to indicate alternating current without a rectifier,
or direct current of the wrong polarity, the movement would be severely damaged. The pulsating dc is
current in a single direction, and so the d’Arsonval meter movement can be used as long as proper polarity
is observed.
