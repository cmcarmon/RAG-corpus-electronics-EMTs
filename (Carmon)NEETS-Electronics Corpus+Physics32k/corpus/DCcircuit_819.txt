We can manage the stray voltage drops between Ra and Rx by sizing the two new resistors
so that their ratio from upper to lower is the same ratio as the two ratio arms on the other side
of the null detector. This is why these resistors were labeled Rm and Rn in the original Kelvin
Double bridge schematic: to signify their proportionality with RM and RN :
