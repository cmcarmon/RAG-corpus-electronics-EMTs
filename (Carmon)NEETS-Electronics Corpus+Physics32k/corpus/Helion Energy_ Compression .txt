To inject the plasmoid into the fusion ‘burn’ chamber two plasmoids are accelerated at high velocity with pulsed magnetic fields and merge into a single plasmoid at high pressure. Their experiments achieved plasmas of 1.5 Tesla and 2 keV temperatures. Published records show plans to compress fusion plasmas to 12 Tesla.
