is  enhanced  with  thermal  layers  in  the  substrate,  such  as  the  previously  mentioned  copper/Invar.  There  will
also be designs that will rely on the traditional through-hole device with heat sink to maximize heat transfer.
An example of this would be the typical three-terminal voltage regulator mounted on a heat sink or directly
to a metal chassis for heat conduction, for which standard calculations apply [Lee et al., 1993].
