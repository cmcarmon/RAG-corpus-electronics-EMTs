A common example of the Doppler effect in action is the changing pitch of the whistle of an
approaching train. The whistle appears to change pitch from a high tone, as the train approaches, to a
lower tone as it moves away from the observer. As the train approaches, an apparent increase in
frequency (an increase in pitch) is heard; as the train moves away, an apparent decrease in frequency (a
decrease in pitch) is heard. This pitch variation is known as the Doppler effect.
