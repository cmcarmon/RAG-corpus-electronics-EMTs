Pipelining can also be used to improve the performance in software programmable multiprocessor systems.
Most  software  programmable  DSP  processors  are  programmed  using  assembly  code.  The  assembly  code  is
generated  by  high-level  compilers  that  perform  scheduling.  Schedulers  typically  use  the  acyclic  precedence
graph  to  construct  schedules.  The  removal  of  all  edges  in  the  signal  (or  data)  ï¬‚ow  graph  containing  delay
