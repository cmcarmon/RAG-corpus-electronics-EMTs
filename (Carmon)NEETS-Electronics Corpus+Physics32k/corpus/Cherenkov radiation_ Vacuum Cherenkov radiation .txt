The Cherenkov effect can occur in vacuum. In a slow-wave structure, the phase velocity decreases and the velocity of charged particles can exceed the phase velocity while remaining lower than



c


{\displaystyle c}
. In such a system, this effect can be derived from conservation of the energy and momentum where the momentum of a photon should be



p
=
ℏ
β


{\displaystyle p=\hbar \beta }
(



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
is phase constant) rather than the de Broglie relation

. This type of radiation (VCR) is used to generate high power microwaves.
