The coaxial output circuit consists of a length of coaxial line in which the center conductor is shaped
into a loop and inserted into one of the magnetron cavities for magnetic coupling. The load side of the
coupling line may feed either an external coaxial line or a waveguide. If the external line is coaxial, the
connection may be direct or by means of choke joints. If the external line is a waveguide, the output
circuit must include a satisfactory junction from the coaxial line to the waveguide. One type of junction
used quite often is the PROBE COUPLER. The probe coupler acts as an antenna radiating into the
waveguide.
