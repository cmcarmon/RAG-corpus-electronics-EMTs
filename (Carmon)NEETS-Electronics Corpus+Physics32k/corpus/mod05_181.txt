In a shunt motor, speed is usually controlled by a rheostat connected in series with the field 
windings, as shown in figure 2-8. When the resistance of the rheostat is increased, the current through the 
field winding is decreased. The decreased flux momentarily decreases the counter emf. The motor then 
speeds up, and the increase in counter emf keeps the armature current the same. In a similar manner, a 
decrease in rheostat resistance increases the current flow through the field windings and causes the motor 
to slow down.
