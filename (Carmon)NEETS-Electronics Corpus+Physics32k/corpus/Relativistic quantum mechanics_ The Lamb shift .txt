In 1947 the Lamb shift was discovered: a small difference in the 2S​1⁄2 and 2P​1⁄2 levels of hydrogen, due to the interaction between the electron and vacuum. Lamb and Retherford experimentally measure stimulated radio-frequency transitions the 2S​1⁄2 and 2P​1⁄2 hydrogen levels by microwave radiation. An explanation of the Lamb shift is presented by Bethe. Papers on the effect were published in the early 1950s.
