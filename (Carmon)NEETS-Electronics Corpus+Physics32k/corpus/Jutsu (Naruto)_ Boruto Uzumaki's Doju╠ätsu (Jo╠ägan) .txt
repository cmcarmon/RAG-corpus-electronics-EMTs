This type of dojÅ«tsu was awakened by Boruto Uzumaki, Naruto and Hinata Hyuga's son. When activated either at will or subconsciously, the color of the eye changes, sporting a light blue iris surrounded by black sclera. It is capable of detecting if a person is possessed by an evil entity and can spot weak points in a chakra system, thus enabling Boruto to strike it with precision. This ocular jutsu may have other visual powers, but they are yet to be seen. Boruto can awaken it only in his right eye subconsciously, though in the future, he becomes trained enough to activate it at will.
