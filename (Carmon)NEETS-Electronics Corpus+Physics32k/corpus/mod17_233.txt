A variation of amplifier gain, similar to the example, is necessary if we are going to compensate for
input signal strength variations. The required amplifier gain variations can be accomplished automatically
by the addition of an agc circuit within the receiver. Letâ€™s take a look at the methods and circuits used to
produce agc and the manner in which agc (avc) controls receiver gain.
