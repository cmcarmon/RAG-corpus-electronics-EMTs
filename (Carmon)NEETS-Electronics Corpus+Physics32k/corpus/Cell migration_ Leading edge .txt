Experimentation has shown that there is rapid actin polymerisation at the cell's front edge. This observation has led to the hypothesis that formation of actin filaments "push" the leading edge forward and is the main motile force for advancing the cellâ€™s front edge. In addition, cytoskeletal elements are able to interact extensively and intimately with a cell's plasma membrane.
