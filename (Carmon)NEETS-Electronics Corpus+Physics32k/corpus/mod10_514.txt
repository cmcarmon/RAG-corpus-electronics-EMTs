Study each part of figure 3-27 carefully and you will get a clear picture of how the resultant
waveforms of voltage are produced. You will also see that the resultant voltage wave on an open-ended

points are always in the same place, the resultant of the incident and the reflected wave is called a
STANDING WAVE of voltage.
