TUNNEL-DIODE FREQUENCY CONVERTERS AND MIXERS.â€”Tunnel diodes make 
excellent mixers and frequency converters because their current-voltage characteristics are highly 
nonlinear. While other types of frequency converters usually have a conversion power loss, tunnel-diode 
converters can actually have a conversion power gain. A single tunnel diode can also be designed to act as 
both the nonlinear element in a converter and as the negative-resistance element in a local oscillator at the 
same time.
