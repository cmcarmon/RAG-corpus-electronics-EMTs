(b) For a given torque, the motor operates at a ﬁxed slip speed for all frequencies as long as
the ﬂux is maintained constant. At rated torque, the slip speed NSl = 1200 − 1170 = 30
r/min. Hence, synchronous speed at 570 r/min is NS = N + NSl = 570 + 30 = 600
r/min. Therefore, the inverter frequency is (600/1200)60 = 30 Hz.
