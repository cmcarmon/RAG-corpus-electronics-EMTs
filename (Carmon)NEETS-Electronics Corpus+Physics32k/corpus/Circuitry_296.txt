Example 6.2 
 
The  R–C  smoothing  filter  in  a  50  Hz  mains 
operated half-wave rectifier circuit consists of R1 =
100 G and C2 = 1,000 µF. If 1 V of ripple appears 
at the input of the circuit, determine the amount of 
ripple appearing at the output. 
 
Solution 
 
First  we  must  determine  the  reactance  of  the 
capacitor, C1, at the ripple frequency (50 Hz):
