The power system is a nonlinear dynamic system consisting of
generators, loads, and control devices, which are coupled to-
gether by the transmission network. The dynamic equations of
the generator have been discussed in the previous section. The
interactions of the generators with the loads and the control
devices can result in diverse nonlinear phenomena. SpeciÔ¨Å-
cally, we are interested in understanding whether the system
response can return to an acceptable operating condition
following disturbances. Normally, we distinguish between
two types of disturbances in the power system context:
