It  is  evident  that  the  phase  relationships  among  these  three  phasors  are  the  same  as  the  ones  among  the
voltages and the currents. That is, the second leads the ﬁrst by 120(cid:176) and the third lags the ﬁrst by 120(cid:176). Hence,
just like the voltages and the currents, the sum of these three phasors will also be zero. This is a very signiﬁcant
result. Although the instantaneous power delivered by each source has a constant component and a sinusoidal
component, when the three powers are added, the sinusoidal components add to zero, leaving only the constants.
Thus, the total power delivered to the three loads is constant.
