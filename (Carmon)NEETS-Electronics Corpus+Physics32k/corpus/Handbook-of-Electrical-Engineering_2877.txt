volume.  Therefore,  they  will  have  the  least  amount  of  oxide  formation.  Uneven  distribution  of  sphere  sizes
within a given paste can lead to uneven heating during the reï¬‚ow process, with the result that the unwanted
solder balls will be expelled from the overall paste mass at a given pad/lead site. Fine-pitch paste has smaller
ball sizes and consequently more surface area on which oxides can form.
