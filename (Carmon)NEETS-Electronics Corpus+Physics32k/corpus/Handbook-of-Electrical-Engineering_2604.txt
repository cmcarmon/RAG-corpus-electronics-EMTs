Threshold voltage is controlled by oxide thickness d and by body doping. To control the body doping, ion
implantation is used so that the dopant-ion density is not simply a uniform extension of the bulk, background
level  NB  ions/unit  volume  but  has  superposed  upon  it  an  implanted-ion  density.  To  estimate  the  threshold
voltage, we need a picture of what happens in the semiconductor under the gate as the gate voltage is changed
from its off level toward threshold.
