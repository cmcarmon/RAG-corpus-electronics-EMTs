The size of the EFA device limits the amount of airflow that can be generated. A possible improvement involves layering or stacking a series of EFA devices to increase the airflow. Existing limitations and focus areas in this approach are that larger device sizes are inconvenient, especially for smaller applications such as netbooks. There can be interference between the stages, where the attractor electrode of the first stage and the ionizing electrode of the next stage produce an unwanted corona effect, which can actually result in reverse airflow. Alternatively, sparking can also occur if the layers are placed too close together. It is believed that careful design of the geometry of the devices can improve on all these issues.
