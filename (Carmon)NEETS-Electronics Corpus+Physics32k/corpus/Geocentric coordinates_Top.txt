Geocentric coordinates are an Earth-centered system of locating astronomical objects in the Solar System in three dimensions along the Cartesian X, Y, and Z axes. They are differentiated from topocentric coordinates, which use the observer's location as the reference point for bearings in altitude and azimuth. However, neither system takes Earth's constant motion into account, which requires the addition of a time component to fix objects.
For nearby stars, astronomers use heliocentric coordinates, with the center of the Sun as the origin. The plane of reference can be aligned with the Earth's celestial equator, the ecliptic, or the Milky Way's galactic equator. These 3D celestial coordinate systems add actual distance as the Z axis to the equatorial, ecliptic, and galactic coordinate systems used in spherical astronomy.
The distances involved are so great compared to the relative velocities of the stars, that for most purposes, the time component can be neglected.
