This kind of decomposition is unique to discrete-time signals, and will prove useful subsequently.
2.4.5 Symbolic-valued Signals
Another interesting aspect of discrete-time signals is that their values do not need to be real numbers. We
do have real-valued discrete-time signals like the sinusoid, but we also have signals that denote the sequence
of characters typed on the keyboard. Such characters certainly arenâ€™t real numbers, and as a collection of
possible signal values, they have little mathematical structure other than that they are members of a set.
More formally, each element of the symbolic-valued signal s (n) takes on one of the values {a1, . . . , aK} which
comprise the alphabet A. This technical terminology does not mean we restrict symbols to being mem-
bers of the English or Greek alphabet. They could represent keyboard characters, bytes (8-bit quantities),
integers that convey daily temperature. Whether controlled by software or not, discrete-time systems are
ultimately constructed from digital circuits, which consist entirely of analog circuit elements. Furthermore,
the transmission and reception of discrete-time signals, like e-mail, is accomplished with analog signals and
systems. Understanding how discrete-time and analog signals and systems intertwine is perhaps the main
goal of this course.
2.5 Introduction to Systems8
Signals are manipulated by systems. Mathematically, we represent what a system does by the notation
y (t) = S [x (t)], with x representing the input signal and y the output signal.
