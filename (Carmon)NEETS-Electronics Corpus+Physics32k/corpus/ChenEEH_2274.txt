For a good conductor, the conductivity is very large, and
e00  s=v from equation 3.10. In this case, the penetration
depth is more commonly referred to as the skin depth d
because the value may be very small. (There is no relation to
the d symbol appearing in the loss tangent symbol.) For a good
conductor:
