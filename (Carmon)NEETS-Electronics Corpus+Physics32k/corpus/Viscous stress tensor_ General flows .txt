The viscous stress tensor is only a linear approximation of the stresses around a point p, and does not account for higher-order terms of its Taylor series. However in almost all practical situations these terms can be ignored, since they become negligible at the size scales where the viscous stress is generated and affects the motion of the medium. The same can be said of the strain rate tensor E as a representation of the velocity pattern around p.
Thus, the linear models represented by the tensors E and ε are almost always sufficient to describe the viscous stress and the strain rate around a point, for the purpose of modelling its dynamics. In particular, the local strain rate E(p,t) is the only property of the velocity flow that directly affects the viscous stress ε(p,t) at a given point.
On the other hand, the relation between E and ε can be quite complicated, and depends strongly on the composition, physical state, and microscopic structure of the material. It is also often highly non-linear, and may depend on the strains and stresses previously experienced by the material that is now around the point in question.
