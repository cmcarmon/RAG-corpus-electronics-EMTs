The neutron cross section, and therefore the probability of an interaction, depends on:
the target type (hydrogen, uranium…),
the type of nuclear reaction (scattering, fission…).
the incident particle energy, also called speed or temperature (thermal, fast…),
and, to a lesser extent, of:
its relative angle between the incident neutron and the target nuclide,
the target nuclide temperature.
