The last several equations are the key relations for minor-loop design using this frequency response approach.
These  relations  indicate  that  some  forms  of  series  compensation  yield  a  given  major-loop  transfer  function
GMc(s) which will not be appropriate for realization by minor-loop compensation. In particular, a lead network
series compensation cannot be realized by means of equivalent minor-loop compensation. The gain of the Ô¨Åxed
plant  GMu(s)  is  raised  at  high  frequencies  due  to  the  use  of  a  lead  network  compensation. Also,  we  see  that
GMc(s) can only be lowered by use of a minor-loop gain Gm(s).
