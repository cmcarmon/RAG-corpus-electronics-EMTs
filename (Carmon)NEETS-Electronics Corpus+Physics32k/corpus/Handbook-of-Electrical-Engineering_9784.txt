Two Major Approaches to Modeling
In principle, models of a given physical system can be developed by two distinct approaches. Figure 100.2 shows
 The real-world system is represented by an interconnection of idealized
the steps involved in 
elements. Table 100.1 [Dorf, 1989] shows model elements from several disciplines and their elemental equations.
An electrical circuit diagram is a typical result of this physical modeling step (box 3 of Fig. 100.2). Application
of the appropriate physical laws (Kirchhoff, Newton, etc.) to the idealized physical model (consisting of point
masses, ideal springs, lumped resistors, etc.) leads to a set of mathematical equations. For a circuit these will
