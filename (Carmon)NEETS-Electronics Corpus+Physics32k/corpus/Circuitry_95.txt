Light-dependent resistors 
 
Light-dependent 
a 
semiconductor  material  (i.e.  a  material  that  is 
neither  a  conductor  nor  an 
insulator)  whose 
electrical  characteristics  vary  according  to  the 
amount  of  incident  light.  The  two  semiconductor 
materials  used  for  the  manufacture  of  LDRs  are 
cadmium  sulphide  (CdS)  and  cadmium  selenide 
(CdSe). These materials are most sensitive to light 
in the visible spectrum, peaking at about 0.6 µm for 
CdS  and  0.75  µm  for  CdSe.  A  typical  CdS  LDR 
exhibits  a  resistance  of  around  1  M$ in  complete 
darkness  and  less  than  1  k$ when  placed  under  a 
bright light source (see Fig. 2.17).
