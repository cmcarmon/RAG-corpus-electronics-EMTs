When the negative-going signal is applied, conduction through the tube decreases. Current through
Rk decreases and the voltage drop across Rk decreases. This causes the cathode to go more negative,
which tends to increase conduction through the tube. A negative-going signal is amplified by decreasing
plate current and allowing the plate to go positive (remember the 180ยบ inversion.) Thus, increasing
