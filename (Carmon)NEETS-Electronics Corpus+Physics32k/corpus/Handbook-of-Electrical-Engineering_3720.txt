The most common particulate recording media today are g-Fe2O3, Co surface-modiﬁed g-Fe2O3, CrO2, and
metal particle media. All of these particles are acicular in shape with aspect ratios on the order of 5 or 10 to
1.  The  particles  are  sufﬁciently  small  that  it  is  energetically  most  favorable  for  them  to  remain  in  a  single-
domain saturated state. Because of demagnetizing effects caused by the acicular shape, the magnetization prefers
to align along the long axis of the particle.
