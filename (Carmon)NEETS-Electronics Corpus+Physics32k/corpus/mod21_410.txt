The wavemeter illustrated is of the type commonly used for the measurement of microwave 
frequencies. The device employs a resonant cavity, which effectively acts as a high-Q LC tank circuit. 
The resonant frequency of the cavity is varied by means of a plunger that is mechanically connected to a 
micrometer mechanism. Movement of the plunger into the cavity reduces the cavity size and increases the 
resonant frequency. Conversely, an increase in the size of the cavity (made by withdrawing the plunger) 
lowers the resonant frequency. The microwave energy from the equipment under test is fed into the 
wavemeter through one of two inputs, A or D. A crystal rectifier then detects or rectifies the signal, and 
the rectified current is indicated on the current meter, M.
