).  Earth-
pointing spacecraft usually carry horizon scanners that locate the center of the earthâ€™s carbon-dioxide disc. All
spacecraft navigate by radio tracking from earth. When interplanetary spacecraft approach the target planet,
the navigation computers (on earth) transform from sun-centered to planet-centered coordinates by observing
star occultations and transmitting the images to earth for human interpretation. During the Apollo translunar
missions,  crews  experimentally  measured  the  angle  between  celestial  bodies  and  the  earth  or  moon  with  a
specially  designed  manual  sextant  coupled  to  a  digital  computer  which  calculated  the  state  vector.  Other
experiments have been made in which American and Soviet crews used manual sextants to observe the angle
between celestial bodies and landmarks on earth, from which state vectors were calculated. Autonomous land
vehicles on other planets and certain military spacecraft may need celestial navigation.
