The degree to which a fluid will “remember” where it came from depends on the entropy. Viscoelastic properties in fluids cause them to snap back to entropically favorable conformations. Recoil is observed when a favorable conformation is in the fluid’s recent past. However, the fluid cannot fully return to its original position due to energy losses stemming from less than perfect elasticity.
Recoiling fluids display fading memory meaning the longer a fluid is elongated, the less it will recover. Recoil is related to characteristic time, an estimate of the order of magnitude of reaction for the system. Fluids that are described as recoiling generally have characteristic times on the order of a few seconds. Although recoiling fluids usually recover relatively small distances, some molten polymers can recover back to 1/10 of the total elongation. This property of polymers must be accounted for in polymer processing.
