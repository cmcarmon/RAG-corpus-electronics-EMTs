The Manganese Dioxide-Alkaline-Zinc Cell is similar to the zinc-carbon cell except for the 
electrolyte used. This type of cell offers better voltage stability and longer life than the zinc-carbon type. 
It also has a longer shelf life and can operate over a wide temperature range. The manganese dioxide-
alkaline-zinc cell has a voltage of 1.5 volts and is available in a wide range of sizes. This cell is 
commonly referred to as the alkaline cell.
