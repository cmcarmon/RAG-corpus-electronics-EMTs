At low signal frequencies, the capacitors, Cp, Cm, and Co in the model of Fig. 28.14(b), can be replaced by
open circuits. A straightforward circuit analysis of the resultantly simpliÔ¨Åed equivalent circuit produces ana-
lytical  expressions  for  the  low  frequency  values  of  the  small  signal  voltage  gain, A v CE  = VO S/VS T;  the  driving
point input impedance, ZinCE; and the driving point output impedance, ZoutCE. Because the Early resistance, Ro,
is invariably much larger than the resistance sum (Rc + Re + RLT), the low frequency voltage gain of the common
emitter cell is expressible as
