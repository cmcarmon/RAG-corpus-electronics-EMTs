. Session identiﬁcation: A multimedia session often con-
sists of multiple media streams (including continuous
media (e.g., audio, video) and discrete media (e.g., text,
images)
that need to be separately identiﬁed. For
example, the sender might choose to send the audio and
video as two separate streams over the same network
connection, and the receiver needs to decode each syn-
chronously. Another example is that the sender might put
the audio and video streams together but divide quality
into a base layer and some enhancement layers so that
low-bandwidth receivers might be able to receive only the
base layer, whereas high-bandwidth receivers might also
receive the enhancement layers.
