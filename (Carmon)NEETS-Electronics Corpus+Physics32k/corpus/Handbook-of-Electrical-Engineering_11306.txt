Implantable Cardioverter Deﬁbrillators
The  Implantable  Cardioverter  Deﬁbrillator  (ICD)  was  ﬁrst  conceived  of  by  Dr.  Michael  Mirowski  in  the  mid-
1960s  [Mirowski  et al.,  1970].  He  imagined  a  device  that  would  continuously  monitor  the  hearts  of  high-risk
individuals for life-threatening arrhythmias and intervene by electrical shock to restore normal sinus rhythm. Just
over a decade later, the ﬁrst patient was successfully implanted with an ICD [Mirowski et al., 1980]. From there,
rapid development ensued, and FDA approval was obtained in 1985, at which time Cardiac Pacemakers Incorpo-
rated (CPI) took over the marketing and development of the ICD. Since then a number of competitors have arisen,
and the ICD has evolved into a remarkably sophisticated medical device capable of bradycardia and antitachycardia
pacing, low-energy cardioversion, high-energy deﬁbrillation shocks, and extensive diagnostics (Fig. 115.14).
