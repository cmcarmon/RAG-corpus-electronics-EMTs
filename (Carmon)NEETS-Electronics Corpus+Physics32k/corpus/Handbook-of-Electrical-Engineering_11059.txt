Nyenhuis  et  al.  [1991]  analyzed  the  factors  pertaining  to  the
optimum  design  of  such  annular  coils  and  calculated  the  mag-
netic-ﬁeld energy and ohmic heating. They found that the mag-
netic ﬁeld energy exhibits a broad minimum when the coil outer
radius is between two and ﬁve times the target distance. Ohmic
heating  in  the  coil  decreases  as  the  radius  of  the  coil  increases.
Increasing  annular  width  results  in  a  small  reduction  in  ﬁeld
energy and coil heating; thin coils (small height) reduce the ﬁeld
energy  but  increase  heating. A  reasonable  compromise  between
efﬁciency and coil size is a coil with an outer diameter that is twice
the  distance  between  the  coil  surface  and  the  underlying  target
tissue to be stimulated and whose height and annular width are
0.2 and 0.6 that of the mean radius, respectively.
