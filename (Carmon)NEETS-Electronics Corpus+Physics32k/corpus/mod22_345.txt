You can also generate reports by specifying what records to use, what fields to print, where to print 
the fields, and which data fields, if any, need to be combined. For example, your supply officer wants to 
know the value of the inventory. You can specify that the extended price is to be calculated by 
multiplying the item quantity by the unit price, and that the extended prices are to be totaled.
