The preceding examples illustrate how a complex network could be reduced to a simple
representation at an output port. The effect of load on the terminal behavior or the effect of an
output load on the network can easily be evaluated. Thévenin and Norton equivalent circuits
help us in matching, for example, the speakers to the ampliﬁer output in a stereo system. Such
equivalent circuit concepts permit us to represent the entire system (generation and distribution)
