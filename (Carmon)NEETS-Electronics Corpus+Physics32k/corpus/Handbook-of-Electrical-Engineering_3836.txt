Input Impedance
At a given frequency the impedance at the feedpoint of an antenna can be represented as 
. The
 (known as the input resistance) corresponds to radiated ﬁelds plus losses, while the imaginary
real part of 
part (known as the input reactance) arises from stored evanescent ﬁelds. The radiation resistance is obtained
