VLIW has potential performance advantages because its control unit is relatively simple. Because the work
of  ﬁnding  parallelism  is  performed  by  the  compiler,  a  VLIW  machine  does  not  require  the  sophisticated
execution  unit  of  a  superscalar  processor.  This  allows  a  VLIW  video  processor  to  run  at  high  clock  rates.
However,  it  does  rely  on  the  compiler’s  ability  to  ﬁnd  enough  parallelism  to  keep  the  function  units  busy.
Furthermore, complex algorithms may have some sections that are not highly parallel and therefore will not
be sped up by the VLIW mechanism. If one is not careful, these sequential sections of code can come to limit
the overall performance of the application.
