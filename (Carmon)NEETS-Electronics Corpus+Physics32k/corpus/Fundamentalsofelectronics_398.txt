Exercise 4.9
(Solution on p. 140.)
Compare the bandwidth required for the direct encoding scheme (one nonzero Fourier coeﬃcient
for each letter) to the binary number scheme. Compare the bandwidths for a 128-letter alphabet.
Since both schemes represent information without loss – we can determine the typed letter uniquely
from the signal’s spectrum – both are viable. Which makes more eﬃcient use of bandwidth and
thus might be preferred?
Exercise 4.10
(Solution on p. 140.)
Can you think of an information-encoding scheme that makes even more eﬃcient use of the spec-
trum? In particular, can we use only one Fourier coeﬃcient to represent N letters uniquely?
