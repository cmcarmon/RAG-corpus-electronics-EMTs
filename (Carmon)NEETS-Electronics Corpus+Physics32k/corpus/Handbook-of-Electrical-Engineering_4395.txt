MCVD Process. 
In the MCVD process (Fig. 42.20), a fused-silica tube of extremely high purity and dimen-
sional uniformity is cleaned in an acid solution and degreased. The clean tube is mounted on a glass working
lathe. A mixture of reactants is passed from one end of the tube and exhaust gases are taken out at the other
end while the tube is being rotated. A torch travels along the length of the tube in the direction of the reactant
ï¬‚ow.  The  reactants  include  ultra-high-purity  oxygen  and  a  combination  of  one  or  more  of  the  halides  and
oxyhalides (SiCl4, GeCl4, POCl3, BCl3, BBr3, SiF4, CCl4, CCl2F2, Cl2, SF6, and SOCl2 ).
