Introduction
In the 1970s and 1980s, speech researchers began to turn to
stochastic approaches to modeling of speech in an effort to
address the problem of variability, particularly in large-scale
systems (Baker, 1975; Jelinek et al., 1975). The term stochastic
approach is used to indicate that models are employed that
inherently characterize some of the variability in the speech.
This is to be contrasted with the straightforward ‘‘determinis-
tic’’ use of the speech data in template-matching (e.g., DTW)
approaches in which no probabilistic modeling of variability is
present.
