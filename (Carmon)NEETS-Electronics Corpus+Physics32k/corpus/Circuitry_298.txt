Figure  6.9  shows  the  circuit  of  a  half-wave 
power  supply  with  an  Lâ€“C  smoothing  circuit.  At 
the  ripple  frequency,  L1 exhibits  a  high  value  of 
inductive  reactance  while  C1 exhibits  a  low  value 
of capacitive reactance. The combined effect is that 
of  an  attenuator  which  greatly 
the 
amplitude  of  the  ripple  while  having  a  negligible 
effect on the direct voltage.
