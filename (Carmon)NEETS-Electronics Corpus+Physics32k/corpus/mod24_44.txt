The transmitter converts the input signal to an optical signal suitable for transmission. The
transmitter consists of two parts, an interface circuit and a source drive circuit. The transmitter's drive
circuit converts the electrical signals to an optical signal. It does this by varying the current flow through
the light source. The two types of optical sources are light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes.
