Normal law differs depending on the stage of flight. These include:
Stationary at the gate
Taxiing from the gate to a runway or from a runway back to the gate
Beginning the take-off roll
Initial climb
Cruise climb and cruise flight at altitude
Final descent, flare and landing.
During the transition from take-off to cruise there is a 5-second transition, from descent to flare there is a two-second transition, and from flare to ground there is another 2 second transition in normal law.
