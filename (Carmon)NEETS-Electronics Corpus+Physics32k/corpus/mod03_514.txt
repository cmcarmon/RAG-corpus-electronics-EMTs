Figure 3-17 is a cutaway view of a solenoid showing the solenoid action. A solenoid is an
electromagnet formed by a conductor wound in a series of loops in the shape of a spiral. Inserted within
this coil is a soft-iron core and a movable plunger. The soft-iron core is pinned or held in an immovable
position. The movable plunger (also soft iron) is held away from the core by a spring when the solenoid is
deenergized.
