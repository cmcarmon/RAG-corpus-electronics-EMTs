The advantage of an MCT over-IGBT is its low forward voltage drop. N-type MCTs will be expected to have a
similar forward voltage drop, but with an improved reverse bias safe operating area and switching speed. MCTs
have relatively low switching times and storage time. The MCT is capable of high current densities and blocking
voltages in both directions. Since the power gain of an MCT is extremely high, it could be driven directly from
