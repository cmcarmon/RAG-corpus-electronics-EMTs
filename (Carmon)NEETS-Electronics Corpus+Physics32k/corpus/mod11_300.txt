Figure 3-5A, shows a TRUNCATED PARABOLOID. Since the reflector is parabolic in the 
horizontal plane, the energy is focused into a narrow beam. With the reflector TRUNCATED (cut) so that 
it is shortened vertically, the beam spreads out vertically instead of being focused. This fan-shaped beam 
is used in radar detection applications for the accurate determination of bearing. Since the beam is spread 
vertically, it will detect aircraft at different altitudes without changing the tilt of the antenna. The 
truncated paraboloid also works well for surface search radar applications to compensate for the pitch and 
roll of the ship.
