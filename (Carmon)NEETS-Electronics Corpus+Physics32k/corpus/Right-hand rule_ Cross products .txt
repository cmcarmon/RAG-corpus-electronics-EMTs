The cross product of two vectors is often taken in physics and engineering. For example, in statics and dynamics, torque is the cross product of lever length and force, while angular momentum is the cross product of linear momentum and distance. In electricity and magnetism, the force exerted on a moving charged particle when moving in a magnetic field B is given by:





F

=
q

v

Ã—

B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} }

The direction of the cross product may be found by application of the right hand rule as follows:
The index finger points in the direction of the velocity vector v.
The middle finger points in the direction of the magnetic field vector B.
The thumb points in the direction of the cross product F.
For example, for a positively charged particle moving to the North, in a region where the magnetic field points West, the resultant force points up.
