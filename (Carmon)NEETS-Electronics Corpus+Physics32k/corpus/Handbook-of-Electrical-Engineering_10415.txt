Designers of C3 systems often fail to acknowledge the fact that the “central, essential ingredients in any command
and  control  system  are  not  the  things  which  they  plan  and  design;  rather  they  are  the  commanders  and
decisionmakers  themselves”  [Wohl,  1981].  Despite  its  centrality,  designation  of  human  roles  is  seemingly
arbitrary  and  often  controversial.  In  most  system  studies,  the  human  decisionmaker  is  not  thought  of  as  an
integral part of the system, but is instead given an external position as a “user” of data or an “input” to the rest
of the system. Without a means of integrating the behavior of interrelated decisionmakers into a comprehensive
description of system response, the proper hominal role is difﬁcult to determine. To justify and support human
action, a clear understanding of the beneﬁts and limitations of human intervention is required.
