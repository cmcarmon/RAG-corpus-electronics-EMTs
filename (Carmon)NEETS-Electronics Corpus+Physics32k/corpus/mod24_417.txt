Some fiber optic data links require more than simple point-to-point connections. These data links
may be of a much more complex design that requires multi-port or other types of connections. Figure
4-23 shows some example system architectures that use more complex link designs. In many cases these
types of systems require fiber optic components that can redistribute (combine or split) optical signals
throughout the system.
