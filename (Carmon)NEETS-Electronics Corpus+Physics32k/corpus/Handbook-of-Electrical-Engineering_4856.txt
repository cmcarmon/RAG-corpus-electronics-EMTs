Information concerning the symmetry properties of the valleys can be derived from the representation surface
of the longitudinal P11 piezoresistance component. This surface can be constructed by measuring the depen-
dence of P11 on the crystallographic direction. Smith showed that P11 is maximum in the <001> directions of
n-type  silicon  and  not  quite  zero  in  the  <111>  directions.  Reasons  for  the  deviation  from  the  deformation
potential  model  of  piezoresistivity  in  multivalley  semiconductors  are  discussed  in  Keyes  [1960].  For  n-type
germanium P11 is maximum in the <111> directions. This is consistent with the loci of the valleys in these
two  materials.  Qualitatively,  a  piezoresistance  effect  is  produced  whenever  the  stress  destroys  the  symmetry
elements that are responsible for the degeneracy of the valleys.
