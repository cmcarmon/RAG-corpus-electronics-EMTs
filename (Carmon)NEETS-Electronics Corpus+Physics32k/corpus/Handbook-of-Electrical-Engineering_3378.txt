The method of end-ﬁre coupling optical ﬁbers to the LiNbO3 waveguide is commonly called pigtailing. This
is the only practical packaging method now used for integrated optic devices that operate in a real system and
outside the laboratory. The reasons for this are quite logical. The end user installs the device in his system by
connecting  to  the  ﬁber  pigtails.  The  connection  can  be  made  with  single-mode  connectors  or  by  splicing.
Flexibility is one of the big advantages of using ﬁber pigtails.
