described in Figure 7.32. Note that the source and load ter-
minal conditions are part of the design parameters and are
included in the network synthesis. In this case, two-port S-
parameters can effectively be used to characterize a ﬁlter in
terms of S11 and S21 for its return and insertion losses, respec-
tively. In a low-loss ﬁltering system, magnitudes of both S-
parameters are directly related to each other, thus allowing to
derive one if the other is known. Phase characteristics of a ﬁlter
are important for certain practical applications, such as phase
