Although  the  alpha  rhythm  is  the  most  prominent  electrical  activity,  other  frequencies  are  present.  For
example, there is a considerable amount of low-voltage, high-frequency (beta) activity ranging from 18 to 30
Hz. It is usually found in the frontal part of the brain. However, the normal electroencephalogram contains
waves of various frequencies (in the range of 1 to 60 Hz) and amplitudes, depending on the cerebral state. To
establish  communication  among  electroencephalographers,  a  terminology  has  been  developed  to  describe
waveforms and their frequencies; Table 113.1 presents a glossary of these terms.
