Manufacturing facilities have a need to develop and 
maintain production	schedules to monitor the 
progress on the production line. Over the years, man-
agement and workers have developed many clever 
and practical methods for controlling production 
schedules. Manufacturing organizations can generate 
and update production schedules, which are specific 
plans that identify when certain controllable activities 
should take place.
