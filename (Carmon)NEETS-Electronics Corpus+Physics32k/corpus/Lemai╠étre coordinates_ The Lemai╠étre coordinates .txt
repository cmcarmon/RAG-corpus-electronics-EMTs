and

This metric has a coordinate singularity at the gravitational radius



r

g




{\displaystyle r=r_{g}}
.
Georges Lemaître was the first to show that this is not a real physical singularity but simply a manifestation of the fact that the static Schwarzschild coordinates cannot be realized with material bodies inside the gravitational radius. Indeed, inside the gravitational radius everything falls towards the centre and it is impossible for a physical body to keep a constant radius.

(notice that the numerator and denominator are switched inside the square-roots), leads to the Lemaître coordinate expression of the metric,

{\displaystyle r=\left[{\frac {3}{2}}(\rho -\tau )\right]^{2/3}r_{g}^{1/3}\;.}

The trajectories with ρ constant are timelike geodesics with τ the proper time along these geodesics. They represent the motion of freely falling particles which start out with zero velocity at infinity. At any point their speed is just equal to the escape velocity from that point.
In Lemaître coordinates there is no singularity at the gravitational radius, which instead corresponds to the point

{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}(\rho -\tau )=r_{g}}
. However, there remains a genuine gravitational singularity at the center, where



ρ

τ

{\displaystyle \rho -\tau =0}
, which cannot be removed by a coordinate change.
The Lemaître coordinate system is synchronous, that is, the global time coordinate of the metric defines the proper time of co-moving observers. The radially falling bodies reach the gravitational radius and the centre within finite proper time.

{\displaystyle dr=\left(\pm 1-{\sqrt {r_{g} \over r}}\right)d\tau ,}

therefore no signal can escape from inside the Schwarzschild radius, where always



d

{\displaystyle dr<0}
and the light rays emitted radially inwards and outwards both end up at the origin.
