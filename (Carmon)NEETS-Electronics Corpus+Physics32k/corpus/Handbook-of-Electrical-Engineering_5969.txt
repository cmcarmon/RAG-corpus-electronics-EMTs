Hybrid  stepping  motors  come  in  a  variety  of  designs.  One,  shown  in  Fig.  66.29,  consists  of  two  rotors
mounted on the same shaft, displaced by one half tooth. The permanent magnet is placed axially between the
rotors, and the magnetic ﬂux ﬂows radially at the air gaps, closing through the stator circuit. Torque is created
by  the  interaction  of  two  magnetic  ﬁelds,  that  due  to  the  magnets  and  that  due  to  the  stator  currents.  This
design allows a ﬁner step angle control and higher torque, as well as smoother torque during a step.
