Now that you have seen the importance of impedance matching the stages in an electronic device, 
you may wonder what impedance characteristics an amplifier has. The input and output impedances of a 
transistor amplifier depend upon the configuration of the transistor. In Module 7, Introduction to 
Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, you were introduced to the three transistor configurations; the 
common emitter, the common base, and the common collector. Examples of these configurations and 
their impedance characteristics are shown in figure 1-14.
