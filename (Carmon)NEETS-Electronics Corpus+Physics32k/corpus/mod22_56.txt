A special-purpose computer, as the name implies, is designed to perform a specific operation and 
usually satisfies the needs of a particular type of problem. Such a computer system would be useful in 
weather predictions, satellite tracking, or oil exploration. While a special-purpose computer may have 
many of the same features found in a general-purpose computer, its applicability to a particular problem is 
a function of its design rather than to a stored program. The instructions that control it are built directly 
into the computer, which makes for a more efficient and effective operation. A drawback of this 
specialization, however, is the computer's lack of versatility. It cannot be used to perform other 
operations.
