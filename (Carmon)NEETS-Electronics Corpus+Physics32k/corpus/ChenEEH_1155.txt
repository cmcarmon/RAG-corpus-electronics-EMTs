Despite such engineering challenges, MEMS offer high per-
formance and are small, require low power, and are relatively
cheap. They both improve on some existing applications and
enable entirely new systems. Some of their applications are
targeted from the outset of design, but others are opportunis-
tic; that is, the large number of MEMS components on the
market make them available to design engineers for a very wide
variety of uses.
