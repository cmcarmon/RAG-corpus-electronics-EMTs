When the input signal reverses polarity, the secondary voltage across L2 also reverses. The diodes
will be reverse biased and no current will flow. Meanwhile, C5 retains most of its charge because of the
long time constant offered in combination with R1 and R2. This slow discharge helps to maintain the
output.
