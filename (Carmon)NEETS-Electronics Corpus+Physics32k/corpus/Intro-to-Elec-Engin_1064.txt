12.2.12 A four-pole dc generator is lap wound with 326
armature conductors. It runs at 650 r/min on full
load, with an induced voltage of 252 V. If the
bore of the machine is 42 cm in diameter, its axial
length is 28 cm, and each pole subtends an angle
of 60°, determine the air-gap ﬂux density. (Note
that the number of parallel paths is equal to the
number of poles for lap windings.)
