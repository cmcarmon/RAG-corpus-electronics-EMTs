A key feature of REMOD designs is that they are extendible
to multiple fault tolerance, with only small increments of
hardware and timeâ€”in some cases, the designs have virtually
no increase in time. On the other hand, PTMR and the other
techniques are not as easily extendible, if at all. As a result,
the mean time to failure (MTTF) of processors using REMOD-
based arithmetic circuits will increase substantially. This is
especially crucial in computer systems used in life- and prop-
erty-critical applications, such as avionics, spacecraft control,
military applications, and the control of industrial processes
and nuclear reactors. Not only are these environments hostile
