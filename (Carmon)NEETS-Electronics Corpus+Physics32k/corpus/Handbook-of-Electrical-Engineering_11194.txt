It  is  generally  agreed  that  brain  function  is  based  on  the  organization  of  the  activity  of  large  numbers  of
neurons into coherent patterns. Since the primary mode of activity of these nerve cells is electrical in nature,
it is not surprising that a composite of this activity can be detected in the form of electrical signals. Of extreme
interest,  then,  are  the  actual  oscillations,  rhythms,  and  patterns  seen  in  the  cryptic  ï¬‚ow  of  electrical  energy
coming from the brain itself, i.e., in the EEG.
