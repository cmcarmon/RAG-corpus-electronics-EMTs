Euler also worked out analogous laws of motion to those of Newton, see Euler's laws of motion. These extend the scope of Newton's laws to rigid bodies, but are essentially the same as above. A new equation Euler formulated is:





I

α

+

ω

I

)

=

τ



{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \left(\mathbf {I} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\omega }}\right)={\boldsymbol {\tau }}}

where I is the moment of inertia tensor.
