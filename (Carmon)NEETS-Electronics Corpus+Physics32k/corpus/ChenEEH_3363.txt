It can be shown that differences between total active power
that is generated and the total active power that is consumed
lead to frequency drifting. Because the load ﬂuctuations them-
selves are random, it is not possible to exactly match the total
generation with the power consumption at all times. There-
fore, the system frequency will tend to drift around on its
own. In North American grids, there exists a central closed-
loop controller that samples system-wide power ﬂows and
