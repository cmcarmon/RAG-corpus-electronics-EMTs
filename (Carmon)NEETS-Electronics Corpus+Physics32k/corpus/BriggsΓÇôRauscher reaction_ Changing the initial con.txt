As noted above, the reaction will oscillate in a fairly wide range of initial concentrations of the reactants. For oscillometric demonstrations, more cycles are obtained in dilute solutions, which produce weaker colour changes. See for example the graph, which shows more than 40 cycles in 8 minutes.
