The Stereometric Lines are so called because their divisions are according to the ratios of solid bodies, out to 148. One of this scale's applications is to calculate, when given one side of any solid body, the side of a similar one that has a given volume ratio to the first. If L is the scale length at 148, then the scale-generating function is:

{\displaystyle f(n)=L(n/148)^{1/3}}
, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 148.
