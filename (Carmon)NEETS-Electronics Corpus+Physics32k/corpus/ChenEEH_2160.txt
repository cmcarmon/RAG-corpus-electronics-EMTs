From the sign of VH , the polarity of the charge can be
determined; from the magnitude of VH , the number density
of charge carriers can be computed. A Hall device can also be
used to measure conductivities of materials and to measure
magnetic ﬁeld strengths (Inan and Inan, 1999; Halliday, 1992).
Imagine that a copper foil of thickness d ¼ 100 mm with
current I ¼ 20 A is placed in magnetic ﬁeld with B0 ¼ 0:5 T.
Substituting equation 1.2 in equation 1.68 and rearranging
gives the following:
