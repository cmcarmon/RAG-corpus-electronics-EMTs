Monaural/interaural/binaural: Monaural attributes of ear input signals (e.g., timbre, loudness) require, in
principle, only one ear to be detected. Interaural attributes of ear input signals (e.g., localization in the
horizontal plane) depend on differences between, or ratios of measures of, the two ear input signals (e.g.,
delay  and  level  differences).  Psychoacoustic  effects  (e.g.,  cocktail-party  effect)  that  depend  on  the  fact
that we have two ears are termed binaural.
