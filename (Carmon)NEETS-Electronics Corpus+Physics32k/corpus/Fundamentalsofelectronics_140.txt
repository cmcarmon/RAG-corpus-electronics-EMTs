The quantity ρ is known as the resistivity and presents the resistance of a unit-length unit cross-
sectional area material constituting the wire. Resistivity has units of ohm-meters. Most materials
have a positive value for ρ, which means the longer the wire, the greater the resistance and thus
the power dissipated. The thicker the wire, the smaller the resistance. Superconductors have zero
resistivity and hence do not dissipate power. If a room-temperature superconductor could be found,
electric power could be sent through power lines without loss!
Exercise 3.4
Calculate the power consumed/created by the resistor R1 in our simple circuit example.
