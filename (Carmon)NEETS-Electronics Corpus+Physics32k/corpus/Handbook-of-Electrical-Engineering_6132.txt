Finite element analysis is not normally used by power system engineers although it is a common tool of high
voltage and electrical machine engineers. It is necessary, for example, where accurate machine representation
is required. For example, in a unit connected HVdc terminal the generators are closely coupled to the rectiﬁer
bridges. The ac system at the rectiﬁer end is isolated from all but its generator. There is no need for costly ﬁlters
to reduce harmonics. Models of the synchronous machine suitable for a transient stability study can be obtained
from actual machine tests. For fast transient analysis, a three-phase generator model can be used but it will not
account for harmonics. A ﬁnite element model of the generator provides the means of allowing real time effects
such as harmonics and saturation to be directly included. Any geometric irregularities in the generator can be
accounted for and the studies can be done at the design stage rather than having to rely on measurements or
extrapolation  from  manufactured  machines  to  obtain  circuit  parameters.  There  is  no  reliance  on  estimated
machine  parameters.  The  disadvantages  are  the  cost  and  time  to  run  a  simulation  and  it  is  not  suitable  at
present to integrate with existing transient stability programs as it requires a high degree of expertise. As the
ﬁnite element model is in this case used in a time simulation, part of the air gap is left unmeshed in the model.
At  each  time  step  the  rotor  is  placed  in  the  desired  position  and  the  missing  elements  in  the  air  gap  region
formed using the nodes on each side of the gap.
