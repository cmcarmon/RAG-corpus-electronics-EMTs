Balanced mixer
Noise that accompanies the LO signal can appear at the IF.
A method of eliminating LO noise is via the balanced mixer.
A balanced mixer uses a four-port hybrid junction as shown in
Figure 10.2. The LO and RF signals are applied to the two
ports. Diode mixers are in each of the remaining two ports. At
one diode, the sum of the RF and LO signals appears, and at
the other diode is the difference of the two signals. The two
diode mixers should have the same characteristics and be well
matched. The IF signal is the subtraction of the two diode
outputs. Because the LO noise at the two diode mixers are in
phase, it will be canceled at the output.
