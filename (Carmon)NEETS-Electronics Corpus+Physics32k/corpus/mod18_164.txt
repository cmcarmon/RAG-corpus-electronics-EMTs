Another form of radar widely used in military and civilian aircraft is the RADAR ALTIMETER. Just
as some surface-based radars can determine the height of a target, airborne radar can determine the
distance from an aircraft to the ground. Many aircraft use radar to determine height above the ground.
Radar altimeters usually use frequency-modulated signals of the type discussed earlier in the chapter.
