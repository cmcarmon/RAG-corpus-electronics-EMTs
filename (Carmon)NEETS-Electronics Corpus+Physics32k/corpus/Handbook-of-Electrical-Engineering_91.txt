The shunt resistance (insulation resistance) Rs accounts for the
dc  leakage  current.  Heat  is  generated  in  the  ESR  from  ripple
current and in the shunt resistance by voltage. The ESR is due to
the spacer-electrolyte-oxide system and varies only slightly except
at low temperature, where it increases greatly.
