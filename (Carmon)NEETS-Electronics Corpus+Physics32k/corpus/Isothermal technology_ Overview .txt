The fundamental modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation. These are temperature-gradient-driving heat transfer.
The driving force for heat transfer can also be indirect. It comes from cross-couplings among different transport processes and transfer heat isothermally in thermal waves/resonances. It can be in various forms and tuned precisely via manipulating the cross coupling.
Typically, many transport processes like thermal, mass, electrical, magnetic transport occur simultaneously in fluids. These processes may couple (or interfere) and cause new induced effects of flows occurring without or against its primary thermodynamic driving force, which may be a temperature gradient, chemical potential, or reaction affinity. Two classical examples of coupled transports are the Soret effect (also known as thermodiffusion) and Dufour effect.
Multiphase fluid can be specially designed for inducing the strong cross-coupling among transport processes, and create tailor-designed thermal waves/resonances for the isothermal heat transfer.
