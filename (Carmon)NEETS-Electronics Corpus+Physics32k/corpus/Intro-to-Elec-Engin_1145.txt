For squirrel-cage-rotor machines, the problem is to keep down the starting current while
maintaining adequate starting torque. The input current, for example, can be no more than 6 times
the full-load current, while the starting torque may be about 1.5 times the full-load torque. Depend-
ing on the capacity of the available supply system, direct-on-line starting may be suitable only
for relatively small machines, up to 10-hp rating. Other starting methods include reduced-voltage
starting by means of wye–delta starting, autotransformer starting, or stator-impedance starting.
For employing the wye–delta starting method, a machine designed for delta operation is
connected in wye during the starting period. Because the impedance between line terminals for
wye connection is three times that for delta connection for the same line voltage, the line current
at standstill for wye connection is reduced to one-third of the value for delta connection. Since the
3 during starting, it follows that the starting torque will
phase voltage is reduced by a factor of
be one-third of normal. For autotransformer starting, the setting of the autotransformer can be
predetermined to limit the starting current to any desired value. An autotransformer, which reduces
the voltage applied to the motor to x times the normal voltage, will reduce the starting current in
the supply system as well as the starting torque of the motor to x2 times the normal values.
