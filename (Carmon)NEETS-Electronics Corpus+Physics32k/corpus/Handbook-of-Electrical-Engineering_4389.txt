Material dispersion is caused by the variation of the refractive
index of the glass with wavelength and the spectral width of the
system source. Waveguide dispersion occurs because light travels
in both the core and cladding of a single-mode ﬁber at an effective
velocity  between  that  of  the  core  and  cladding  materials.  The
waveguide  dispersion  arises  because  the  effective  velocity,  the
waveguide dispersion, changes with wavelength. The amount of
waveguide  dispersion  depends  on  the  design  of  the  waveguide
structure  as  well  as  on  the  ﬁber  material.  Both  material  and
waveguide  dispersion  are  measured  in  picoseconds  (of  pulse
spreading) per nanometer (of source spectral width) per kilome-
ter (of ﬁber length), reﬂecting both the increases in magnitude in
source linewidth and the increase in dispersion with ﬁber length.
