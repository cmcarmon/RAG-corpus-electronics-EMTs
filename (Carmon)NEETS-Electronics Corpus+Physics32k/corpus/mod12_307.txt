Recall from frequency modulation that modulation index is used to calculate the number of
significant sidebands existing in the waveform. The higher the modulation index, the greater the number
of sideband pairs. The modulation index is the ratio between the amount of oscillator deviation and the
frequency of the modulating signal:
