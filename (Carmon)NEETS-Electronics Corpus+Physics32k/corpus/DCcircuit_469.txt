As the total current exits the negative (-) battery terminal at point 8 and travels through
the circuit, some of the ﬂow splits off at point 7 to go up through R1, some more splits off at
point 6 to go up through R2, and the remainder goes up through R3. Like a river branching
into several smaller streams, the combined ﬂow rates of all streams must equal the ﬂow rate
of the whole river. The same thing is encountered where the currents through R1, R2, and R3
join to ﬂow back to the positive terminal of the battery (+) toward point 1: the ﬂow of electrons
from point 2 to point 1 must equal the sum of the (branch) currents through R1, R2, and R3.
