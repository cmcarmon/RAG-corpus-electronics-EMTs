1. Improving the transient response. Increasing the speed of response is generally accomplished by increas-
ing  the  open-loop  gain  Gc(jw)Gp(jw)H(jw)  at  higher  frequencies  such  that  the  system  bandwidth  is
increased. Reducing overshoot (ringing) in the response generally involves increasing the phase margin
m of the system, which tends to remove any resonances in the system. The phase margin f

m occurs at
