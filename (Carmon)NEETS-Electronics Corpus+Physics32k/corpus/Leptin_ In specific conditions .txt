In humans, many instances are seen where leptin dissociates from the strict role of communicating nutritional status between body and brain and no longer correlates with body fat levels:

Leptin level is increased by emotional stress.
Leptin level is chronically reduced by physical exercise training.
Leptin level is decreased by increases in testosterone levels and increased by increases in estrogen levels.
Leptin level is increased by insulin.
Leptin release is increased by dexamethasone.
In obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea, leptin level is increased, but decreased after the administration of continuous positive airway pressure. In non-obese individuals, however, restful sleep (i.e., 8â€“12 hours of unbroken sleep) can increase leptin to normal levels.
