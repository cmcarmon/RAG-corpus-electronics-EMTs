primary of a transformer. The changing resistance of the carbon pile produces a corresponding change in 
the current of the circuit. The varying current in the transformer primary produces an alternating voltage 
in the secondary. The transformer steps up the voltage and matches the low impedance of the microphone 
to the high impedance of the first amplifier. The voltage across the secondary may be as high as 25 volts 
peak. The impedance of this type of microphone varies from 50 to 200 ohms. This effect is caused by the 
pressure of compression and rarefaction of sound waves, discussed in chapter 1 of NEETS, Module 10, 
Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas.
