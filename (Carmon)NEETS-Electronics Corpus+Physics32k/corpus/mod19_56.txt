The purpose of artificial ventilation is to provide a method of air exchange until natural breathing is 
established. Artificial ventilation should be given only when natural breathing has stopped; it must NOT 
be given to any person who is still breathing. Do not assume that breathing has stopped merely because a 
person is unconscious or because a person has been rescued from the water, from poisonous gas, or from 
contact with an electric wire. Remember, DO NOT GIVE ARTIFICIAL VENTILATION TO A 
PERSON WHO IS BREATHING NATURALLY. If the victim does not begin spontaneous breathing 
after you use the head or jaw tilt techniques (discussed later) to open the airway, artificial ventilation must 
be attempted immediately. If ventilation is inadequate, one of the "thrust" methods of clearing the airway 
must be performed, followed by another attempt of artificial ventilation.
