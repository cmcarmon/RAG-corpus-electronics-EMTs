A secondary cell is a cell that can be recharged by 
applying a reverse voltage. An example is the lead-acid 
battery used in automobiles (Figure 12-16). It is made 
of six 2-volt secondary cells connected in  series. Each 
cell has a positive electrode of lead  peroxide (PbO2) and 
a negative electrode of spongy lead (Pb). The electrodes 
are separated by plastic or rubber and immersed in an 
electrolytic solution of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and dis-
tilled water (H2O). As the cell is discharged, the sulfuric 
acid combines with the lead sulfate, and the electrolyte
