A discount function is used in economic models to describe the weights placed on rewards received at different points in time. For example, if time is discrete and utility is time-separable, with the discount function



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}
and with




c

t




{\displaystyle c_{t}}
(or



c
(
t
)


{\displaystyle c(t)}
in continuous time) defined as consumption at time t, total utility is given by




U
(
{

c

t



}

t
=
0


∞


)
=

∑

t
=
0


∞



f
(
t
)
u
(

c

t


)



{\displaystyle U(\{c_{t}\}_{t=0}^{\infty })=\sum _{t=0}^{\infty }{f(t)u(c_{t})}}
.
Total utility in the continuous-time case is given by




U
(
{
c
(
t
)

}

t
=
0


∞


)
=

∫

0


∞



f
(
t
)
u
(
c
(
t
)
)
d
t



{\displaystyle U(\{c(t)\}_{t=0}^{\infty })=\int _{0}^{\infty }{f(t)u(c(t))dt}}

provided that this integral exists.
Exponential discounting and hyperbolic discounting are the two most commonly used examples.
