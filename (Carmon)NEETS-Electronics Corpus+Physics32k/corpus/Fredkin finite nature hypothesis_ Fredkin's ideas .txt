According to Fredkin, "the computational substrate of quantum mechanics must have access to some sort of metric to create inertial motion. Whether or not higher level processes in physics can access this process is another story." According to Witten, "string theory leads in a remarkably simple way to a reasonable rough draft of particle physics unified with gravity"; if Fredkin is correct about inertia, then there is the highly controversial hypothesis that the foundations of physics might depend upon either string theory with the infinite nature hypothesis or some modified version of string theory with Fredkin's finite nature hypothesis, in which inertial mass-energy obeys Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics and not the equivalence principle.
