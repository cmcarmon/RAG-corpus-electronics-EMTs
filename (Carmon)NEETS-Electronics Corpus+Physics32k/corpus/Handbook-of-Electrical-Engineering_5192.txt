The quest for new materials in scientiÔ¨Åc endeavors and engineering applications is everlasting. The emergence of
the smart material concept has set a trend that science and technology in the coming years will rely to a large extent
on the development of exotic materials, with intelligent materials being the leading candidates. Such materials will
be hyper-functional with unstereotyped purposiveness responses to novel and changing situations.
