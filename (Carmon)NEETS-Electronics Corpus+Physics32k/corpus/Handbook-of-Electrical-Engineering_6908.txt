Barkhousen and Other Noise
Barkhousen noise is due to the variations in size and orientation of small regions of ferromagnetic material and
is  especially  noticeable  in  the  steeply  rising  region  of  the  hysteresis  loop.  There  is  also  secondary  emission,
photo and collision ionization, etc.
