It  is  important  to  note  that,  since  the  product  of 
gain and bandwidth is a constant for any particular 
operational  amplifier.  Hence,  an  increase  in  gain 
can only be achieved at the expense of bandwidth, 
and vice versa.  
the  relationship  between 
  Figure  8.5  shows 
typical 
for  a 
voltage  gain  and  bandwidth 
operational  amplifier  (note  that 
the  axes  use 
logarithmic,  rather  than  linear  scales).  The  open-
loop  voltage  gain  (i.e.  that  obtained  with  no 
feedback  applied)  is  100,000  (or  100  dB)  and  the 
bandwidth  obtained  in  this  condition  is  a  mere  10
