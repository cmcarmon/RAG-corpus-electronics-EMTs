The modulation energy in an amplitude-modulated wave is contained entirely within the sidebands. 
Amplitude modulation of a sinusoidal carrier by another sine wave would be displayed as shown in figure 
5-14. For 100% modulation, the total sideband power would be one-half of the carrier power; therefore,
