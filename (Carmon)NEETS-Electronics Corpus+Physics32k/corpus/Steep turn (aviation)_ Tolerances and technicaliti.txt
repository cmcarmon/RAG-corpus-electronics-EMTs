This section would best be understood by a trained private pilot or someone who has studied the curriculum contained within the private pilot ground syllabus. For purposes of testing, a steep turn is a 360 degree turn in either direction with a 45 degree bank angle while maintaining altitude, speed and bank within certain set tolerances. Furthermore, the roll out heading must be within 10 degrees of the entry heading for the manoeuvre to be deemed successful by most flight training standards and check rides.
A steep turn increases the load factor of an aircraft. Simply put the aircraft feels heavier due to the effect of centrifugal force. At a 45 degree bank angle the load factor of an aircraft is 1.4 i.e. the aircraft effectively becomes 40% heavier. This requires the pilot to exert backward pressure on the flight stick or column to raise the nose, thereby creating more lift to maintain altitude. In the event that backward pressure is not exerted on the stick / column, the aircraft will tend to lose altitude. This increase in the lift required also generates what is referred to as lift induced drag which without increased power, means the aircraft will lose speed.
