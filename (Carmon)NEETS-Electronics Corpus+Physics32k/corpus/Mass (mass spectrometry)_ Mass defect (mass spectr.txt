The mass defect used in nuclear physics is different from its use in mass spectrometry. In nuclear physics, the mass defect is the difference in the mass of a composite particle and the sum of the masses of its component parts. In mass spectrometry the mass defect is defined as the difference between the exact mass and the nearest integer mass.
The Kendrick mass defect is the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nearest integer Kendrick mass.
Mass defect filtering can be used to selectively detect compounds with a mass spectrometer based on their chemical composition.
