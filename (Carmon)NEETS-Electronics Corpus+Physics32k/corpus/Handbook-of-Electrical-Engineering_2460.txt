Transfer Conductance
The  slope  of  the  transfer  curve,  dID S /dVGS ,  is  the  dynamic  forward  transfer  conductance,  or  mutual  transfer
conductance,  gm .  We  see  that  gm  starts  off  at  zero  when  VGS  =  VP  and  increases  as  IDS  increases,  reaching  a
maximum when IDS = IDSS. Since IDS = IDSS[1 â€“ (VG S /VP)]2, gm can be obtained as
