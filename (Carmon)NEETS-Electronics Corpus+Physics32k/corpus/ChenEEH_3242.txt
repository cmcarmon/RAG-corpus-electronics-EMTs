Step-type voltage regulators can be either (1) station-type,
which can be single- or three-phase regulators and can be used
in substations for bus voltage regulation or individual feeder
voltage regulation or (2) distribution type, which can be only
single-phase regulators and are used pole-mounted out on
overhead primary feeders. Single-phase step-type voltage regu-
lators are available in sizes from 25 to 833 kVA, whereas three-
phase step-type voltage regulators are available in sizes from
500 to 2,000 kVA. For some units, the standard capacity ratings
can be increased by 25 to 33% by forced-air cooling. Standard
voltage ratings are available from 2,400 to 19,920 V, allowing
regulators to be used on distribution circuits from 2,400 to
34,500 V grounded wye/19,920 V multigrounded wye. Station-
type voltage regulators for bus voltage can be up to 69 kV.
