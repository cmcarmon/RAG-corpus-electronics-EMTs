When both transmitter and receiver rotors in a synchro system are on zero or displaced from zero by 
the same angle, a condition known as CORRESPONDENCE exists. In view A of figure 1-16, the 
transmitter and receiver are shown in correspondence. In this condition, the rotor of the TR induces 
voltages in its stator coils (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V) that are equal to and opposite the voltages 
induced into the TX stator coils (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V). This causes the voltages to cancel and 
reduces the stator currents to zero. With zero current through the coils, the receiver torque is zero and the 
system remains in correspondence.
