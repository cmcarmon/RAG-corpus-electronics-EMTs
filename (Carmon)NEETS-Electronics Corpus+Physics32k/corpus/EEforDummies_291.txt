As you learn more about electronics, you may 
get curious enough to take a look inside some 
of the electronics in your house. Warning: Be 
careful! Follow the safety guidelines given in 
Chapter 13. You might (for example) open up 
the remote control for your TV and see some 
components  wired  up  between  a  touch­
pad  and  an  LED.  On  printed  circuit  boards  
(PCBs) — which serve as platforms for build­
ing  the  mass‐produced  circuits  commonly 
found in computers and other electronic sys­
tems — you may have trouble recognizing the 
individual circuit components. That’s because 
manufacturers use fancy techniques to popu­
late PCBs with components, aiming to eke out 
efficiencies  and  save  space  (known  as  real 
estate) on the boards.
