Coulomb's law states that:

The magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the magnitudes of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.

Coulomb's law can also be stated as a simple mathematical expression. The scalar and vector forms of the mathematical equation are

respectively,
where ke is Coulomb's constant (ke = 8.9875517873681764×109 N m2 C−2), q1 and q2 are the signed magnitudes of the charges, the scalar r is the distance between the charges, the vector r21 = r1 − r2 is the vectorial distance between the charges, and r̂21 = r21/|r21| (a unit vector pointing from q2 to q1). The vector form of the equation calculates the force F1 applied on q1 by q2. If r12 is used instead, then the effect on q2 can be found. It can be also calculated using Newton's third law: F2 = −F1.
