An audio-modulating voltage applied to the grid of V2 is amplified by the modulator and coupled to 
the plate of V1 by modulation transformer T2. The secondary of T2 is in series with the plate-supply 
voltage (E) of V1. The modulating voltage will either add to or subtract from the plate voltage of V1. This 
is shown in view (A) at time 2 and time 3. At time 2 in view (A), the plate supply voltage for V1 
increases to twice its normal value and the rf plate current pulses double, as shown in view (C). At time 3 
in view (A), the supply voltage is reduced to 0 and the rf plate current decreases to 0, as shown in view 
(C). These changes in rf plate current cause rf tank T3 voltage to double at time 2 and to decrease to 0 at 
time 3, as shown in view (E). This action results in the modulation envelope shown in view (E) that 
represents 100-percent modulation. This is transformer-coupled out of tank circuit T3 to an antenna. 
Because of the oscillating action of tank circuit T3, V1 has to be rated to handle at least four times its 
normal plate supply voltage (Eb), as shown by the plate voltage waveform in view (D).
