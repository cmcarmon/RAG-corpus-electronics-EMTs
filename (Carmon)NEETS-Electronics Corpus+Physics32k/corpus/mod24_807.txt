While most fiber optic systems employ digital modulation techniques, there are certain applications
where analog modulation techniques are preferred. The transmission of video using analog techniques is
very popular, especially for shorter distances, where costs can be minimized and complex multiplexing
and timing equipment is unnecessary. The transmission of analog voice signals may also be attractive in
small, short-haul systems. In addition, fiber optic sensor systems may incorporate analog transmission.
Requirements that analog transmission places on applications include high signal-to-noise ratio and high
source linearity. While analog transmission can be attractive for short-haul or medium-haul systems, it is
unattractive for long-haul systems where digital techniques provide better performance.
