7. What if sophisticated logic designers want to optimize their design for certain parameters
as speed or area
how the gate-level abstraction is augmented with additional parameters
size
circuit without being forced to delve into the internal details of the gate.
8. Because the MOSFET in Figure 6.14 serves to pull the output voltage to a low value when it is
its ON state, the MOSFET is sometimes referred to as the pulldown MOSFET.
9. Because it pulls the output to a high value, the load resistor is sometimes referred to as the pullup
resistor.
10. We will see additional design constraints on RL as we progress to more accurate MOSFET
models.
