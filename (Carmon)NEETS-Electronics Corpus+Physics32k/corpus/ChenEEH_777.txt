Thus, we observe that intrasignal in-place mapping helps
reduce the memory size occupied by the individual array
variable(s). In practice, we have observed that loop transform-
ations such as loop fusion, loop tiling (Ciernak and Li, 1995;
Lam et al., 1991), and data reuse decisions (Diguet et al., 1997)
(see Section 2.4) help improve the temporal locality of data.
Intrasignal in-place data mapping reduces the memory size of
the data with good temporal locality. Thus, this technique is
complementary to the loop transformations used for enhan-
cing locality of data.
