In DCTs where the two clutches are arranged concentrically, the larger outer clutch drives the even-numbered gears and the smaller inner clutch drives the odd-numbered gears. Shifts can be accomplished without interrupting torque distribution to the driven roadwheels, by applying the engine's torque to one clutch at the same time as it is being disconnected from the other clutch. Since alternate gear ratios can preselect an odd gear on one gear shaft while the vehicle is being driven in an even gear (and vice versa), DCTs are the fastest-shifting road car transmission available and are even able to shift faster than a professional racing driver using a manual transmission. DCTs can even shift more quickly than cars equipped with single-clutch automated-manual transmissions (AMTs), also called single-clutch semiautomatics. Also, with a DCT, shifts can be made more smoothly than with a single-clutch AMT, making a DCT more suitable for conventional road cars.
