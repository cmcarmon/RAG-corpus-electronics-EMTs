The Gramme-ring armature is constructed by winding an insulated wire around a soft-iron ring (fig. 
2-6). Eight equally spaced connections are made to the winding. Each of these is connected to a 
commutator segment. The brushes touch only the top and bottom segments. There are two parallel paths 
for current to follow â€” one up the left side and one up the right side. These paths are completed through 
the top brush back to the positive lead of the battery.
