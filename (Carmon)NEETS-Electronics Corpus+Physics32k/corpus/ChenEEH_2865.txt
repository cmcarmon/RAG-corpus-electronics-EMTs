The function of a mixer is to convert RF energy to intermedi-
ate frequency (IF) energy with minimum loss and without
spurious responses. The inputs to the mixer are the signal at
the radio frequency and the sinusoid from a local oscillator
(LO). The output is the signal at the intermediate frequency.
Mixing is the process of multiplying the RF signal by the local
oscillator and then low-pass Ô¨Åltering the product.
