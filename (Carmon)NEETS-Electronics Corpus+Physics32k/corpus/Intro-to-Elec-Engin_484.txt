Number Systems
A number system, in general, is an ordered set of symbols (digits) with relationships deÔ¨Åned for
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The base (radix) of the number system is the
total number of digits in the system. For example, in our decimal system, the set of digits is {0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and hence the base (radix) is ten (10); in the binary system, the set of digits
(bits) is {0, 1} and hence the base or radix is two (2).
