Other than CMOS ASIC realization that needs high product
volume to amortize the prototyping cost, FPGA is one of the
alternatives provided that allows the timing requirement to be
satisﬁed. In addition, reconﬁgurable computing has emerged
with similar architecture to FPGA where a 2-D array of recon-
ﬁgurable logic cells are interconnected by a programmable
interconnect and surrounded by input/output cells. To satisfy
dynamic reconﬁgurability on the same platform, the context or
conﬁguration is stored locally in each cell. This emergence of
the dynamically conﬁgurable hardware may soon inﬂuence
algorithm-to-hardware synthesis. Hence, the time to market
can be shortened.
