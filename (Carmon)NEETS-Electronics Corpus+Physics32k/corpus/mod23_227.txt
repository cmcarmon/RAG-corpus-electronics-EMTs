There are two ways to record and reproduce analog signals. The first way is direct record. Itâ€™s also
called amplitude modulation (AM) electronics. The second way is frequency modulation (FM). Even
though direct record and reproduce circuits are much different from FM record and reproduce electronics,
they both share the same two very important jobs. They both must:
