Maximon – an hypothetical elementary particle of maximum mass in the mass spectrum of elementary particles having mass of 5 × 1028 eV. Maximons can be electrically charged or neutral, they can have internal temperature of maximum or absolute zero, spin. They can look like black holes also.
Existence of maximons was postulated by Soviet academician M. A. Markov in 1966.
