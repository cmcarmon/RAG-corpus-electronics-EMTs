There are various types of photomultipliers with different physical arrangements to optimize for a speciÔ¨Åc
application. The high voltage supply ranges from 700 to 3000 V, and the electron multiplication gain is normally
adjusted  by  varying  the  supply  voltage.  The  linearity  of  a  photomultiplier  is  very  good,  typically  3%  over  3
decades of light level. Saturation is normally encountered at high anode currents caused by space charge effects
at the last dynode where most of the current is generated. The decoupling capacitors, C1, on the last few dynodes
are used for high-frequency response and to prevent saturation from the dynode resistors.
