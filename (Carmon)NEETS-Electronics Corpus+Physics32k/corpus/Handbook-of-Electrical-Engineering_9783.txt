systems  have  variables  that  are  functions  of  both  space  and  time  (such  as  the  voltage
along  a  transmission  line  or  the  deﬂection  of  a  point  on  an  elastic  structure).  They  are  described  by  partial
systems (described by
differential equations. These are often approximately modeled as a set of 
ordinary differential or difference equations) by using modal expansions, ﬁnite element methods, or other approx-
imations [Brogan, 1968]. The lumped parameter continuous-time and discrete-time families are stressed here.
