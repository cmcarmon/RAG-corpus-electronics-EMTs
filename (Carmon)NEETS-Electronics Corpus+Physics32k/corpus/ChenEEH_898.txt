Further Improvement
Problem LCSS–SAFE (see equation 4.19) provides a solution
to the clock skew scheduling problem for a case in which
circuit reliability is of primary importance and clock period
minimization is not the focus of the optimization process. As
shown in the previous subsection, a certain degree of safety
may be achieved by computing a feasible clock schedule sub-
ject to artiﬁcially smaller permissible ranges (as deﬁned in
equation 4.19). Problem LCSS–SAFE, however,
is a brute
force approach since it requires that the same absolute margins
of safety are observed for each permissible range regardless of
the range width. Therefore, this approach does not consider
the individual characteristics of a permissible range and does
not differentiate among local data paths with wider and
narrower permissible ranges.
