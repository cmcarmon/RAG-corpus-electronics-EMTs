Flash  A/D  converters  have  conversion  times  ranging  typically  from  10  to  50  ns.  Flash  A/D  conversion
techniques enable these ICs to be used in many specialized high-speed data acquisition applications such as
TV  video  digitizing  (encoding),  radar  analysis,  transient  analysis,  high-speed  digital  oscilloscopes,  medical
ultrasound imaging, high-energy physics, and robotic vision applications.
