Some meter movements are polarity-insensitive, relying on the attraction of an unmagne-
tized, movable iron vane toward a stationary, current-carrying wire to deï¬‚ect the needle. Such
meters are ideally suited for the measurement of alternating current (AC). A polarity-sensitive
movement would just vibrate back and forth uselessly if connected to a source of AC.
