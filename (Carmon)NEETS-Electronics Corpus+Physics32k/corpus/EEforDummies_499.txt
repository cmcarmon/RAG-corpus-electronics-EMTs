the light to change. Embedded in the street several yards before the inter-
section is an inductive loop consisting of several turns of a gigantic coil, 
roughly six feet in diameter. This loop is connected to a circuit that con-
trols the traffic signal. As your car passes over the loop, the steel under-
body of your car changes the magnetic flux of the loop. The circuit detects 
this change — and gives you the green light. Metal detectors use inductors 
in a similar way to pick up the presence of magnetic or metallic objects.
