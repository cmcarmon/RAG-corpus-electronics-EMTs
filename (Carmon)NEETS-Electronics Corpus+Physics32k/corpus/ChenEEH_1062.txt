(A) SCMOS general structure has two complemen-
tary networks: PMOS pull-up network for charging the output into
Vdd, and NMOS pull-down network to discharge the output to GND.
The SCMOS style requires 2N transistors to implement a function.
(B) DCMOS general structure has only an NMOS pull-down struc-
ture. The DCMOS style operates in two phases controlled by a
clocking signal, CLK. When CLK ¼ 0, the DCMOS gate is in the
precharge state, where the PMOS transistor controlled by CLK is on
allowing the output to charge to Vdd. At the same time, the pull-
down network is off since the NMOS transistor controlled also by
CLK is off (CLK ¼ 0). When CLK ¼ 1, the evaluate state takes place,
allowing the output to be evaluated as a function of the input.
DCMOS style requires N þ 2 transistors to implement a function.
