The evolution at the process technology side has been the most
prominent in the DRAM, leading to new device structures like
the recessed-array stacked capacitor technology (Horiguchi
et al., 1995) resulting in a 1-Gb version in 0.16-mm TLM
CMOS and the single-electron Coulomb cell (Yano et al.,
1996) for even larger sizes. Multilevel
logic is also being
