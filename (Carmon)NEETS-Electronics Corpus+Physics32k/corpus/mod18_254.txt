The duration of the modulator pulse depends on the values of inductance and capacitance in each LC
section of the artificial transmission line in view A and the number of LC sections used. Other
arrangements of capacitors and inductors (such as the pulse-forming network shown in view B) are very
similar in operation to artificial transmission lines.
