Determining temperature rise 
 
The  ability  of  a  heatsink  and  transistor  mounting 
arrangement  to  dissipate  heat  can  be  measured  in 
terms  of 
junction 
temperature  exceeds  the  ambient  (or  surrounding 
air)  temperature.  A  perfect  heatsink  and  mounting 
arrangement  would  keep  the  junction  temperature 
the same as that of the surrounding air. In practice, 
the junction temperature will rise under operational 
conditions.  
 
In  practice,  a  rise  in  junction  temperature  is 
unavoidable.  What  is  important,  however,  is  that 
the  maximum  junction  temperature,  TJmax, must 
never  be  exceeded.  Furthermore,  manufacturers 
provide a de-rating characteristic that must be used 
to  determine  device  rating  (percentage  of  full 
power 
junction 
temperature  exceeds  its  normally  specified  value 
(see Fig. 19.33). 
  The temperature rise, (cid:3)T, above ambient will be
