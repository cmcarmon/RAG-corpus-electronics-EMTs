Numerous functional forms are useful in describing the source variation with time. These were discussed in
Section 2.1â€”the step, impulse, ramp, sinusoidal, and dc functions. For example, an ideal independent dc voltage
source  is  described  by  vS(t)  = V S,  where VS  is  a  constant. An  ideal  independent  sinusoidal  current  source  is
described by  iS(t) = I S sin(wt + f)  or  iS(t) = I S cos(wt + f),  where IS is a constant, w = 2p f with f the frequency
in  hertz  and  f  is  a  phase  angle.  Ideal  sources  may  be  used  to  model  actual  sources  such  as  temperature
transducers, phonograph cartridges, and electric power generators. Thus usually the time form of the output
cannot  generally  be  described  with  a  simple,  basic  function  such  as  dc,  sinusoidal,  ramp,  step,  or  impulse
waveforms. We  often,  however,  represent  the  more  complicated  waveforms  as  a  linear  combination  of  more
basic functions.
