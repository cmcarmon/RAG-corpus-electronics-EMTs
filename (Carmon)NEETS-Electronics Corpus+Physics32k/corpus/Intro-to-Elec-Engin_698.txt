7.2.20 (a) In the circuit shown in Figure P7.2.20, the
zener diode (with zero zener resistance) op-
erates in its reverse breakdown region while
the voltage across it is held constant at VZ
and the load current is held constant at VZ/RL,
as the source voltage varies within the limits
VS,min < VS < VS,max. Find Imax and Imin
for the corresponding Rmin and Rmax, respec-
tively.
