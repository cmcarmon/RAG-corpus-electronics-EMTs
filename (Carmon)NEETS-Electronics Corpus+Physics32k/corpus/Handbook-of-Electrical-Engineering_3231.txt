torque  region,  whereas  the  ﬁeld  weakening  mode  is  deﬁned  as  the  constant  power  region. At  any  operating
speed,  the  ﬁeld  can  be  reversed  and  the  converter  ﬁring  angle  can  be  controlled  beyond  90  degrees  for
regenerative braking mode operation of the drive. In this mode, the motor acts as a generator (with negative
induced  voltage)  and  the  converter  acts  as  an  inverter  so  that  the  mechanical  energy  stored  in  the  inertia  is
converted to electrical energy and pumped back to the source. Such two-quadrant operation gives improved
efﬁciency if the drive accelerates and decelerates frequently. The speed of the machine can be controlled with
precision by a feedback loop where the command speed is compared with the machine speed measured by a
tachometer. The speed loop error generally generates the armature current command through a compensator.
The  current  is  then  feedback  controlled  with  the  ﬁring  angle  control  in  the  inner  loop.  Since  torque  is
proportional to armature current (with ﬁxed ﬁeld), a current loop provides direct torque control, and the drive
can accelerate or decelerate with the rated torque. A second bridge converter can be connected in antiparallel
so that the dual converter can control the machine speed in all the four quadrants (motoring and regeneration
in forward and reverse speeds).
