Crawling is used mainly:
When a person cannot yet walk because of being an infant
When a person cannot walk due to disability, being wounded, sick, or drunk
In very low places (caves, under a table, in a mine, etc.). Sometimes underground miners need to crawl long distances during their work
When searching for something on the ground
To get down to the ground in gardening, for maintenance or other work-related purposes which require a good reach on the ground
For stealth (camouflage and quietness)
To lower the field of vision
As an exercise
As a token of submission
For fun or comical purposes
During a fire, crawling may be used because the air near the ground is easier to breathe
