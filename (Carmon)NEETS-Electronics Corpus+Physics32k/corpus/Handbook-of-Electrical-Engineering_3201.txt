a. Below-resonance (leading PF) mode.  When the switching frequency is below the natural resonance
frequency,  the  converter  operates  in  a  below-resonance  mode  (Fig. 30.33).  The  equivalent  impedance
across AB presents a leading PF so that natural turn-off of the switches is assured and any type of fast
turn-off  switch  (including  asymmetric  SCRs)  can  be  used.  Depending  on  the  instant  of  turn-on  of
switches  S1  and  S2,  the  converter  can  enter  into  two  modes  of  operation,  namely,  continuous  and
discontinuous  current  modes.  The  steady-state  operation  in  continuous  current  mode  (CCM)
[Fig. 30.33(a)] is explained brieï¬‚y as follows.
