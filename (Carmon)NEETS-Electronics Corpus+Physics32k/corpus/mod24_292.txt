Coatings and buffers protect the optical fiber from breakage and loss caused by microbends. During
the fiber drawing process, the addition of a primary coating protects the bare glass from abrasions and
other surface contaminants. For additional protection, manufacturers add a layer of buffer material. The
buffer material provides additional mechanical protection for the fiber and helps preserve the fiber's
inherent strength.
