Economists have realized significance of precautionary saving long ago. Historically, the precautionary motive for saving has been recognized by economists since the time of John Maynard Keynes. Moreover, Alfred Marshal stressed the importance of saving to secure against future risks: "The thriftlessness of early times was in great measure due to the want of security that those who made provision for the future would enjoy it".
Defining this concept, individuals save out of their current income to smooth the expected consumption stream over time. The impact of the precautionary saving is realized through its impact on current consumption, as individuals defer their current consumption to be able to maintain the utility level of consumption in the future if income drops.
Some examples of events that create the need for precautionary saving include health risk, business risk, unavoidable expenditures, and risk of labor income change, saving for retirement and a child's education.
Precautionary savings are intimately associated with investments, if earnings are not used for purchasing commodities and services; there is a probability that the precautionary savings can be invested to generate fixed capital and achieve economic growth.
Precautionary saving is different from precautionary savings. Saving is a flow variable quantity, measured in units of currency per unit of time (such as dollars per year). Conversely, the savings denotes the accumulated stock of funds that is present at a single point of time.
A higher rate of precautionary saving would lead to a higher growth in an individual's net worth.
