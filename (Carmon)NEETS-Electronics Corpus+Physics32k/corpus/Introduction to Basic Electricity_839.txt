desktop	publishing	(dtP) uses page layout soft-
ware on a personal computer to create a wide range of 
printed matter. Desktop publishing allows more con-
trol over layout and design than word processing does.
When skillfully used, desktop publishing can pro-
duce printed literature with an attractive layout and a 
type quality comparable to traditional typesetting and 
printing. Desktop publishing allows an individual or 
small business to publish without the expense of using 
a commercial printer.
