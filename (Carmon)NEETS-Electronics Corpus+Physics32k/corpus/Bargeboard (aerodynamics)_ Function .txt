Aerodynamically, bargeboards act primarily as flow conditioners, smoothing and redirecting the turbulent or "dirty" air in the wake of the front wing, the front suspension links, and the rotating front wheels.
Part of their function is to direct the turbulent wakes of the front wing and spinning front wheels away from downstream aerodynamic surfaces. In this capacity, they separate different components of this mixture of flows, and direct them either outside and around the sidepods, or direct flow towards the radiator inlets. As such, the configuration of bargeboards can have significance with respect to cooling. They also help direct flow behind the front wheels, reducing the wake drag created by the wheel profile.
