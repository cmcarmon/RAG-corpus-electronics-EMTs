The co-moving spacecraft has no windows. An observer is not able to tell which direction is the






r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
direction, nor can he/she know which direction is the velocity with respect to earth. The orientation of the spacecraft may be quite different from the simple coordinate system in which the ceiling is in the






r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
direction and the front of the craft is in a direction coplanar with the radius and the velocity. We can transform our simple coordinates to an arbitrarily oriented coordinate system through rotations. This, however, destroys the diagonal nature of the curvature matrix.
Rotations are performed with a rotation matrix

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
such that the separation vector

The curvature in the new coordinate system is non-diagonal. The inverse problem of transforming an arbitray coordinate system into a diagonal system can be performed mathematically with the process of diagonalization.
