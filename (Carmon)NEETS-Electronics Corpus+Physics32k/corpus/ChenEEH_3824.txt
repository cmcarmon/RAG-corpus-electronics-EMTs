The image ﬁltering can be carried out either in the spatial
domain, as in equation 4.16, or in the frequency domain, using
the discrete Fourier
(Mersereau and
Dudgeon, 1984; Oppenheim and Schaffer, 1989). For ﬁltering
using the DFT, we use the well known property that the DFT of
the circular convolution of two sequences is equal to the
product of the DFTs of the two sequences. That is, for y(m,n)
deﬁned as in equation 4.16, provided that a DFT of sufﬁcient
size is used, we have that:
