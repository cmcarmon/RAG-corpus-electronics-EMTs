A schematic of the individual phase control system is shown in Fig. 61.16. Six timing voltages are derived
from the ac bus voltage, and the six grid pulses are generated at nominally identical delay times subsequent to
the respective voltage-zero crossings. The delays are produced by independent delay circuits and controlled by
a common direct voltage Vc, which is derived through a feedback loop to control constant dc line current or
constant power. Several variations of this control were used until the late 1960s.
