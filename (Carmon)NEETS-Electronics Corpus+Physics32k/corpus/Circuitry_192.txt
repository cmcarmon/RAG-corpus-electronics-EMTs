Table 4.1) is 0.353. Hence: 
 
Ir.m.s. = 0.353 × Vpk-pk = 0.353 × 0.05 = 0.0177 A 
 
(or 17.7mA). 
 
Example 4.6 
 
A sinusoidal  voltage  10  V  pk-pk  is  applied  to  a 
resistor  of  1  kF What  value  of  r.m.s.  current  will 
flow in the resistor? 
 
Solution 
 
This  problem  must  be  solved  in  two  stages.  First 
we  will  determine  the  peak-peak  current  in  the 
resistor and then we shall convert this value into a 
corresponding r.m.s. quantity.  
 
Since
