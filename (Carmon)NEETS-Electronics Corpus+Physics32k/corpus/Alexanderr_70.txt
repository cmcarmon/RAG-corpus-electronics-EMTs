Elements  are  in  series  when  they  are  chain-connected  or  connected
sequentially,  end  to  end.  For  example,  two  elements  are  in  series  if
they  share  one  common  node  and  no  other  element  is  connected  to
that common node. Elements in parallel are connected to the same pair
of  terminals.  Elements  may  be  connected  in  a  way  that  they  are  nei-
ther in series nor in parallel. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, the volt-
age source and the 5-
resistor are in series because the same current
will ï¬‚ow through them. The 2-
resistor, and the cur-
rent source are in parallel because they are connected to the same two
nodes  b and  c and  consequently  have  the  same  voltage  across  them.
The  5-
resistors  are  neither  in  series  nor  in  parallel  with
each other.
