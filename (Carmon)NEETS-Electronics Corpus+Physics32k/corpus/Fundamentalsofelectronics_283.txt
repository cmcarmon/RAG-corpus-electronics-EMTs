This equation cannot be solved in closed form. We must understand what is going on from basic principles,
using computational and graphical aids. As an approximation, when vin is positive, current ﬂows through
the diode so long as the voltage vout is smaller than vin (so the diode is forward biased). If the source is
negative or vout “tries” to be bigger than vin, the diode is reverse-biased, and the reverse-bias current ﬂows
through the diode. Thus, at this level of analysis, positive input voltages result in positive output voltages
with negative ones resulting in vout = −RI0.
