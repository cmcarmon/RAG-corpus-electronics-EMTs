As we unfold the impedance story, we’ll see that the powerful use of impedances suggested by Steinmetz21
greatly simpliﬁes solving circuits, alleviates us from solving diﬀerential equations, and suggests a general way
of thinking about circuits. Because of the importance of this approach, let’s go over how it works.
