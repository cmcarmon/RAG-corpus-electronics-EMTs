Series connections
In a series circuit, components are 
arranged along a single path between 
the positive and negative terminals of a 
power source. Take a look at Figure 4-1, 
which shows a series circuit contain-
ing a resistor and two LEDs. Current 
flows from the positive battery ter-
minal through the resistor, through 
LED1, through LED2, and then back to 
the  negative terminal of the battery. 
AÂ series circuit has only one path for 
electrical charges to travel along, so all 
current passes through each compo-
nent sequentially.
