Figure 4-4, views A-C show the individual windings for each phase. Figure 4-4, view D, shows how
the three phases are tied together in a Y-connected stator. The dot in each diagram indicates the common
point of the Y-connection. You can see that the individual phase windings are equally spaced around the
stator. This places the windings 120ยบ  apart.
