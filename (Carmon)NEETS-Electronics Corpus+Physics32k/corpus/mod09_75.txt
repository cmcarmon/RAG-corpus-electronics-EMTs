First, note that XL and XC are equal. This shows that the circuit is resonant to the applied frequency 
of 205 kHz. XL and XC are opposite in effect; therefore, they subtract to zero. (2580 ohms âˆ’ 2580 ohms = 
zero.) At resonance, then, X = zero. In our theoretically perfect circuit with zero resistance and zero 
reactance, the total opposition to current (Z) must also be zero.
