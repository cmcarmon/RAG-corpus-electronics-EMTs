Plot a graph showing how drain current (ID) varies 
with gate-source voltage (VGS) and use the graph to 
determine: 
 
(a)   the value of ID when VGS = 0 V, and 
(b)   the  slope  of  the  graph  (expressed  in  mA/V) 
 
 
The  data  has  been  shown  plotted  in  Fig.  A8.10. 
Note that, since the values of VGS that we have been 
given are negative, we have plotted these to the left 
of the vertical axis rather than to the right of it.
