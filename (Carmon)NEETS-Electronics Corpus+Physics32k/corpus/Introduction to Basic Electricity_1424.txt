Electrical charges are created by the displacement of 
electrons. When there is an excess of electrons at one 
point and a deficiency of electrons at another point, a dif-
ference of potential exists between the two points. When 
a difference of potential exists  between two charged bod-
ies connected by a conductor,  electrons will flow along 
the conductor. This flow of electrons is called current.
