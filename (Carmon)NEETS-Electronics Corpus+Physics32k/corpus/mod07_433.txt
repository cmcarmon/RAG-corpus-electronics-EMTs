output waveforms in figure 4-16 represent the unfiltered and filtered outputs of the half-wave rectifier 
circuit. Current pulses flow through the load resistance (RL) each time a diode conducts. The dashed line 
indicates the average value of output voltage. For the half-wave rectifier, Eavg is less than half (or 
approximately 0.318) of the peak output voltage. This value is still much less than that of the applied 
voltage. With no capacitor connected across the output of the rectifier circuit, the waveform in view A has 
a large pulsating component (ripple) compared with the average or dc component. When a capacitor is 
connected across the output (view B), the average value of output voltage (Eavg) is increased due to the 
filtering action of capacitor C1.
