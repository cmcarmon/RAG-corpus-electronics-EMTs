Interestingly, when ringing occurs during the transient, calculating the propagation delay
is not as straightforward as in the RC case. In the RC case, the propagation delay of the
driving inverter was simply the time required for the output voltage to fall below the
valid output low threshold, VOL (see Section 10.4.2). For our discussion, we will assume
that when the inductance of the connecting wire is relevant, the delay associated with
the driving inverter includes the effect of both the inductor LI and the gate capacitance
CGS2. Accordingly, we can see from the circuit model in Figure 12.37 that the relevant
output node for computing the propagation delay of the driving inverter is vIN2 = vC.
With ringing behavior during a falling transition, this output is a valid low only when all
oscillations remain below the VOL threshold. The corresponding tpd,0→1 propagation
delay is depicted in Figure 12.39; recall that for an inverter tpd,0→1 is the delay of the
inverter for a low to high transition at the input, and hence a high to low transition at
the output.
