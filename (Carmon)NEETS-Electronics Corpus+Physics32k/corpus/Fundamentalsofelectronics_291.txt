i =
C1vin +C2iin. This result means that we can think of the current as a superposition of two components,
each of which is due to a source. We can ﬁnd each component by setting the other sources to zero.
Thus, to ﬁnd the voltage source component, you can set the current source to zero (an open circuit) and
use the usual tricks. To ﬁnd the current source component, you would set the voltage source to zero
(a short circuit) and ﬁnd the resulting current. Calculate the total current i using the Superposition
Principle. Is applying the Superposition Principle easier than the technique you used in part (1)?
