A communication network is a collection of communication links with many signal sources and many users.
Computer simulation programs for networks often deal with problems of routing, ï¬‚ow and congestion control,
and  the  network  delay.  While  this  chapter  deals  with  the  communication  link,  the  reader  is  reminded  that
network simulation is also an important area of study. The simulation methodologies used for communication
networks are different from those used on links because, in a communication link simulation, each waveform
present  in  the  system  is  sampled  using  a  constant  sampling  frequency.  In  contrast,  network  simulations  are
event-driven, with the important events being such quantities as the time of arrival of a message.
