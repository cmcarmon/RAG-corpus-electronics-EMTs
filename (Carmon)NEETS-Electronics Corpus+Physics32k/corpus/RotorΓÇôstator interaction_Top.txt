An important issue for the aeronautical industry is the reduction of aircraft noise. The rotorâ€“stator interaction is a predominant part of the noise emission. We will present an introduction to these interaction theory, whose applications are numerous. For example, the conception of air-conditioning ventilators requires a full understanding of this interaction.
