Dissolution is not an instantaneous process. The rate of solubilization (in kg/s) is related to the solubility product and the surface area of the material. The speed at which a solid dissolves may depend on its crystallinity or lack thereof in the case of amorphous solids and the surface area (crystallite size) and the presence of polymorphism. Many practical systems illustrate this effect, for example in designing methods for controlled drug delivery. In some cases, solubility equilibria can take a long time to establish (hours, days, months, or many years; depending on the nature of the solute and other factors).
The rate of dissolution can be often expressed by the Noyes–Whitney equation or the Nernst and Brunner equation of the form:

{\displaystyle {\frac {dm}{dt}}=A{\frac {D}{d}}(C_{\mathrm {s} }-C_{\mathrm {b} })}

where:
m = mass of dissolved material
t = time
A = surface area of the interface between the dissolving substance and the solvent
D = diffusion coefficient
d = thickness of the boundary layer of the solvent at the surface of the dissolving substance
Cs = mass concentration of the substance on the surface
Cb = mass concentration of the substance in the bulk of the solvent
For dissolution limited by diffusion (or mass transfer if mixing is present), Cs is equal to the solubility of the substance. When the dissolution rate of a pure substance is normalized to the surface area of the solid (which usually changes with time during the dissolution process), then it is expressed in kg/m2s and referred to as "intrinsic dissolution rate". The intrinsic dissolution rate is defined by the United States Pharmacopeia.
Dissolution rates vary by orders of magnitude between different systems. Typically, very low dissolution rates parallel low solubilities, and substances with high solubilities exhibit high dissolution rates, as suggested by the Noyes-Whitney equation.
