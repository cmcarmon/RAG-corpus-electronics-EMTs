and having the phase shifts between phases equal to 1208
(Blackburn, 1993). The voltages and current behave according
to Kirchhoff ’s laws of the electrical circuits stating that the sum
of all currents entering and leaving a network node is equal to
zero, and the sum of all voltage drops and gains in a given loop
is also equal to zero. In addition, the voltage and currents
generate electric power that integrated over a period of time
produce energy. For the three-phase systems, a variety of
deﬁnitions
transmitted
power may be established as follows: instantaneous, average,
active, reactive, and complex. The power system consists of
components that are put together with a goal of matching
each other regarding the power ratings, dielectric insulation
levels, galvanic isolation, and number of other design goals.
In the normal operating conditions, currents, voltages, power,
and energy are matched to meet
the design constraints.
