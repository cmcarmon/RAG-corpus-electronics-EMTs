Bernard F. Schutz (born August 11, 1946, in Paterson, New Jersey) is an American physicist. His research is on Einstein's theory of general relativity, specifically on the physics of gravitational waves. He is Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Cardiff University, and was one of the directors and head of the astrophysics group at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany. He is principal investigator in charge of data analysis for the GEO600 collaboration (which, in turn, is part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the largest concerted effort to directly detect gravitational waves). Schutz is also a member of the science team coordinating the planning and development for the space-borne gravitational wave detector LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), and he was instrumental in the foundation of the electronic, open access review journal Living Reviews in Relativity.
