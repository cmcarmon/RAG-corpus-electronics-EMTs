ABFT methods using the mantissas of ﬂoating point quan-
tities can potentially be used to check certain ﬂoating point
operations, such as multiplication using checksums of the
input mantissas treated as integers without being susceptible
to the problem of roundoff errors (Assaad and Dutt, 1992,
1996). The only drawback to this approach is that it cannot be
applied to all ﬂoating point operations (e.g., addition). How-
ever, a hybrid test was formulated that applies both the
ﬂoating-point and integer mantissa checksum tests to appro-
priate parts of a computation (that is amenable to ABFT), thus
covering all its operations. In this manner, much higher error
coverages are obtained compared to using only the ﬂoating-
point test.
