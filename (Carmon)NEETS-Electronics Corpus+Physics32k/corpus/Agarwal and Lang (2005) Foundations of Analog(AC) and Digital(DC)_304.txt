Conservation of energy is itself an extremely powerful method for obtain-
ing many types of results in circuits. It is particularly useful in dealing with
complicated circuits that contain energy storage elements such as inductors
and capacitors that we will introduce in later chapters. Energy methods can
often allow us to obtain powerful results without a lot of mathematical grunge.
We will use two energy-based approaches in this book.
