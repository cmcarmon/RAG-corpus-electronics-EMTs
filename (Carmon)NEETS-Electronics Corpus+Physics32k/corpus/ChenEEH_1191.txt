There are four types of possible transitions when dynamic
charge distribution is considered over cross coupling capaci-
tances as in Figure 7.10. Two parallel wires are placed with
minimum spacing. A type I transition occurs when one of the
signals switches while the other stays unchanged such that the
cross coupling capacitance is then charged up to klCxV , where
the coefﬁcient k1 is introduced as a reference for other types of
transition. In a type II transition, one bus switches from low to
high while the other switches from high to low. The effective
capacitance will be larger than k1 by a factor of k2, the value of
which is usually k2 ¼ 2. In a type III transition, both signals
switch simultaneously, and Cx will not be charged. Because of
possible misalignment of the two transitions, however, the
amount of power consumption varies according to the dy-
namic characteristics by a factor of k3. In a type IV transition,
there is no dynamic charge distribution over cross coupling
capacitance. Thus, k4 is set to zero.
