Light waves obey the law of reflection. Light travels in a straight line through a substance of uniform
density. For example, you can see the straight path of light rays admitted through a narrow slit into a
darkened room. The straight path of the beam is made visible by illuminated dust particles suspended in
the air. If the light is made to fall onto the surface of a mirror or other reflecting surface, however, the
direction of the beam changes sharply. The light can be reflected in almost any direction, depending on
the angle with which the mirror is held.
