Figure  13.23  shows  typical  half-wave  dipole 
aerials  for  domestic  VHF  Band  II  FM  broadcast 
reception. The half-wave dipole in Fig. 13.23(a) is 
horizontally  polarized  (and  therefore  has  a  bi-
directional  characteristic)  whilst 
the  half-wave 
dipole in Fig. 13.23(b) is vertically polarized (and 
therefore has an omni-directional characteristic).
