As the example above demonstrates, the Δv required to perform a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits is not the greatest when the destination radius is infinite. (Escape speed is √2 times orbital speed, so the Δv required to escape is √2 − 1 (41.4%) of the orbital speed.) The Δv required is greatest (53.0% of smaller orbital speed) when the radius of the larger orbit is 15.58 times that of the smaller orbit. This number is the positive root of x3 − 15x2 − 9x − 1 = 0, which is

. For higher orbit ratios the Δv required for the second burn decreases faster than the first increases.
