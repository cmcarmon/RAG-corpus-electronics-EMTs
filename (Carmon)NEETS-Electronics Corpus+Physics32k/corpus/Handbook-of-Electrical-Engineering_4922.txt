If the overall electron correlation is broken, this phase is lost and the material is no longer a superconductor.
There is a broad class of structures, however, known as weak links, where the correlation is merely perturbed
locally in space rather than outright destroyed. Coloquially, we say that the phase “slips” across the weak link
to acknowledge the perturbation.
