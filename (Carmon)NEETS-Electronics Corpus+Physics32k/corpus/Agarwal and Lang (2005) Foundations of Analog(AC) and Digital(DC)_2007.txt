Now we are in a position to calculate the total solution, or the complete time
function v(t), which is the capacitor voltage in response to the cosine tone
burst. The complete solution for the cosine tone burst drive is the sum of
the homogeneous solution vh (Equation 14.14), and the particular solution vp
(Equation 14.20):
v(t) = Ke
