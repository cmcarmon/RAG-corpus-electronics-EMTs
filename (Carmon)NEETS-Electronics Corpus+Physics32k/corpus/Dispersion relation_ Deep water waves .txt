The dispersion relation for deep water waves is often written as




ω
=


g
k


,


{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {gk}},}

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Deep water, in this respect, is commonly denoted as the case where the water depth is larger than half the wavelength. In this case the phase velocity is





v

p


=


ω
k


=



g
k





{\displaystyle v_{p}={\frac {\omega }{k}}={\sqrt {\frac {g}{k}}}}

and the group velocity is

{\displaystyle v_{g}={\frac {d{\omega }}{dk}}={\frac {1}{2}}v_{p}.}
