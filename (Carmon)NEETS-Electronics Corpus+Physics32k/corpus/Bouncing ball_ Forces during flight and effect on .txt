The motion of a bouncing ball obeys projectile motion. Many forces act on a real ball, namely the gravitational force (FG), the drag force due to air resistance (FD), the Magnus force due to the ball's spin (FM), and the buoyant force (FB). In general, one has to use Newton's second law taking all forces into account to analyze the ball's motion:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\sum \mathbf {F} &=m\mathbf {a} ,\\\mathbf {F} _{\text{G}}+\mathbf {F} _{\text{D}}+\mathbf {F} _{\text{M}}+\mathbf {F} _{\text{B}}&=m\mathbf {a} =m{\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}=m{\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}},\end{aligned}}}

where m is the ball's mass. Here, a, v, r represent the ball's acceleration, velocity, and position over time t.
