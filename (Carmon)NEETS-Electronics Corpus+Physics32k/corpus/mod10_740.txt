A MULTIELEMENT PARASITIC array is one that contains two or more parasitic elements with the 
driven element. If the array contains two parasitic elements (a reflector and a director) in addition to the 
driven element, it is usually known as a THREE-ELEMENT ARRAY. If three parasitic elements are 
used, the array is known as a FOUR-ELEMENT ARRAY, and so on. Generally speaking, if more 
parasitic elements are added to a three-element array, each added element is a director. The field behind a 
reflector is so small that additional reflectors would have little effect on the overall radiation pattern. In 
radar, from one to five directors are used.
