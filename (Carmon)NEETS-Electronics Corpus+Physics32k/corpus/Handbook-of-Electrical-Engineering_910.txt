In this example, the PLL is to be used as a FM detector circuit and the FM signal is applied to the input
using a single frequency FM voltage source. The carrier frequency is 600 kHz and the modulation frequency
is 60 kHz. Figure 13.8 shows the input voltage and the output voltage of the PLL at the VCO output and at the
phase detector output. It can be seen that after a brief starting transient, the PLL locks onto the input signal
