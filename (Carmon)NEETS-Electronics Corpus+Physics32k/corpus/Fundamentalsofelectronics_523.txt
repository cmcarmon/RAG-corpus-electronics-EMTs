Solution to Exercise 4.18 (p. 124)
In the bottom-left panel, the period is about 0.009 s, which equals a frequency of 111 Hz. The bottom-right
panel has a period of about 0.0065 s, a frequency of 154 Hz.
Solution to Exercise 4.19 (p. 124)
Because males have a lower pitch frequency, the spacing between spectral lines is smaller. This closer spacing
more accurately reveals the formant structure. Doubling the pitch frequency to 300 Hz for Figure 4.16 would
amount to removing every other spectral line.
