13.7.3 P U R E R E A C T A N C E
Next, we examine the case where the impedance in Figure 13.51 consists only
of inductors and/or capacitors, that is, R = 0. Regardless of the circuit con-
figuration, at any given frequency the impedance must look like either a pure
inductor or a pure capacitor (although it will change from one to the other as
frequency changes, when we go through a resonant frequency). If the circuit is
inductive, then from Equation 13.145, θ = π/2. Again assuming a cosine drive
voltage (φ = 0), Equation 13.149 reduces to:
