Since communication and synchronization are decoupled in
a BSP program, the programmer does not have to worry about
problems such as deadlock, which can occur with synchronous
message passing. Debugging a BSP program is also simpler: the
barrier at the end of a superstep provides an appropriate break
point at which the global state of the parallel computation
is well-deﬁned and can be interrogated. Debugging and
reasoning about the correctness of a BSP program are hence
not much more difﬁcult than for a sequential program. In
addition, BSP provides an analytical cost model to assess the
performance of parallel algorithms, to facilitate analyzing, and
to predict their performance.
