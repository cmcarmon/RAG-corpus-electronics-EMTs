The binary sequence at the output of the channel encoder is passed on to the digital modulator,
which functions as the interface to the communication channel. The primary purpose of the digital
modulator is to map the binary information sequence into signal waveforms, since nearly all the
communication channels used in practice are capable of transmitting electric signals (waveforms).
Because the message has only two amplitudes in a binary system, the modulation process is known
as keying. In amplitude-shift keying (ASK), a carrier’s amplitude is shifted or keyed between two
levels. Phase-shift keying (PSK) involves keying between two phase angles of the carrier, whereas
frequency-shift keying (FSK) consists of shifting a carrier’s frequency between two values. Many
other forms of modulation are also possible.
