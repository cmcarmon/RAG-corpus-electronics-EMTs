Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) currently dominate the movement of parts through a ﬂexible manufac-
turing system (FMS). AGVs typically restrict the path to predetermined routes and subsequently decrease the
“ﬂexibility” of the system. Work is being done on mobile robots to address this issue. Research by Arkin and
Murphy [1990] focuses on intelligent mobility within a manufacturing environment. The reader is also referred
to the research of Wiens and Black [1992] who address a mobile robot system within a manufacturing cell as
a means to increase the ﬂexibility, capability, and capacity of a robot-based manufacturing cell.
