To simulate this circuit using SPICE, we ﬁrst have to designate node numbers for all the
distinct points in the circuit, then list the components along with their respective node num-
bers so the computer knows which component is connected to which, and how. For a circuit of
this simplicity, the use of SPICE seems like overkill, but it serves the purpose of demonstrating
practical use of scientiﬁc notation:
