The dynamic power dissipation is the power required for the
circuit to perform its anticipated tasks. In other words, it is the
power needed for charging and discharging all nodes in a
CMOS circuit. This power is only consumed when the circuit
input signals change. In CMOS circuits, the dyanmic power
dominates the total power dissipation. Such characteristic is
greatly affected by current processes or the deep sub-micron
processes (DSM), for which the ratio of leakage power to
dynamic power is increasing. More details about this issue
are presented in Subsection 5.3.3. Dynamic power dissipation
is illustrated in Figure 5.9 for a simple static CMOS inverter.
When the input signal falls, the PMOS transistor switches on
while the NMOS transistor switches off, creating a path from
the supply voltage to the output capacitance, thus allowing the
output load to charge up to the supply voltage. On the other
hand, when the input signal rises, the opposite scenario occurs:
the NMOS transistor switches on, and the PMOS transistor
switches off, creating a direct path from the output load to
ground and allowing the output load to discharge.
