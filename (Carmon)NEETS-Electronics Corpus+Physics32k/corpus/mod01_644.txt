Fuses and other circuit protection devices are installed in equipment circuits to prevent damage
caused by increases in current. These circuit protection devices are designed to open if current increases
to a predetermined value. Circuit protection devices are connected in series with the circuit or portion of
the circuit that the device is protecting. When the circuit protection device opens, current flow ceases in
the circuit.
