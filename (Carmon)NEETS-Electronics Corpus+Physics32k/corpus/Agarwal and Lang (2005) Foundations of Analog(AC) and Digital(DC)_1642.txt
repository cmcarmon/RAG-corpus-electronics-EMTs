Recall that the average power dissipated is defined as the energy dissipated in a cycle
divided by the cycle time T. During the low half cycle of the input signal, a quantity
of charge equal to QL is transferred from the power source to the capacitor. Assuming
that the cycle time of the input signal is large enough for the capacitor to charge up to
