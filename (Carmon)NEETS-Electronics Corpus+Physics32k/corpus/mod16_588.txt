In view B, the potentials on the vertical and horizontal plates change at the same rate. In the same
time period, say 1 second, both plates move the beam 1 unit. The horizontal plates have completed their
task at the end of 1 second, but the vertical plates have moved the beam only one-third of the required
distance. In this case, the picture in view B would appear on the screen.
