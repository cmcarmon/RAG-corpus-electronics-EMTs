A&E embraces a wide range of topics, it is impossible for us to go here into any depth in any one of them.
Instead, this section will try to give a compressed overview of the topics the author judges to be most important.
In the following, we will look into steerable microphone arrays, digital hearing aids, spatial processing, audio
