Next, a global loop folding and merging transformation is
applied to all the y-loops in the algorithm. As a result, the
functions will not work on a whole image at once anymore but
on a line-per-line pipelining base. This is shown in Figure 2.12.
Finally, a similar global loop folding and merging trans-
formation is applied to the x-loops. The result is that the
algorithm will now work on a Ô¨Åne-grain (pixel-per-pixel)
pipelining base, as illustrated in Figure 2.13.
