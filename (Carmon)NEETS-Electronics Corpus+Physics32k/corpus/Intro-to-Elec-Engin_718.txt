Thus, a biasing signal (current or voltage), in the absence of any other signals, places the
transistor at an operating or quiescent point of its i–v characteristics. Time-varying signals are
usually superimposed on dc biasing signals. Small variations of voltage and current about the
operating point are known as small-signal voltages and currents. While small-signal variations
are just a fraction of the power-supply voltage, the large-scale excursions of a power ampliﬁer may
be comparable to the supply voltage. This chapter is devoted to the study of small-signal ampliﬁers,
in which the relationships between small-signal variables are linear. Graphical solutions including
the transistor’s general nonlinearity are not considered in this text.
