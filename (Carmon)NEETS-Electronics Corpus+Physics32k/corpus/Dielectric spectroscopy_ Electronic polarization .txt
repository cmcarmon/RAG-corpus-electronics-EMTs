This resonant process occurs in a neutral atom when the electric field displaces the electron density relative to the nucleus it surrounds.
This displacement occurs due to the equilibrium between restoration and electric forces. Electronic polarization may be understood by assuming an atom as a point nucleus surrounded by spherical electron cloud of uniform charge density.
