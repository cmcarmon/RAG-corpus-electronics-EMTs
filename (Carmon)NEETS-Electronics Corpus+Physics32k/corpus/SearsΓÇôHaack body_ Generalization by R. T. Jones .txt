The Searsâ€“Haack body shape derivation is correct only in the limit of a slender body. The theory has been generalized to slender but non-axisymmetric shapes by Robert T. Jones in NACA Report 1284. In this extension, the area

{\displaystyle S(x)}
is defined on the Mach cone whose apex is at location

{\displaystyle x}
, rather than on the

{\displaystyle x={\text{constant}}}
plane as assumed by Sears and Haack. Hence, Jones's theory makes it applicable to more complex shapes like entire supersonic aircraft.
