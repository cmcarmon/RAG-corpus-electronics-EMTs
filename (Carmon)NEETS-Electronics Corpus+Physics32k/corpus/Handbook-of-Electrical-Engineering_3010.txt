Design Considerations for the Common Base Ampliﬁer
An adaptation of Eqs. (28.25) through (28.28) to the common base stage conﬁrms that the driving point input
impedance is capacitive at high signal frequencies. On the other hand, gmRb > 1 renders a common base driving
point input impedance that is inductive at high frequencies. This impedance property can be gainfully exploited
to  realize  monolithic  shunt  peaked  ampliﬁers  in  which  the  requisite  circuit  inductance  is  synthesized  as  the
driving point input impedance of a common base stage (or the driving point output impedance of a common
collector cell) [Grebene, 1984].
