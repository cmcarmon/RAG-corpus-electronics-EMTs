The model shows that vbe is ampliÔ¨Åed independently of frequency because there are no capacitances to its
right, so an analysis of low-frequency response devolves down to determining vbe in terms of e. Here, part of e
will appear across the capacitive reactance XCc, and the remainder is vb e. So, to make the concept of reactance
valid, a sinusoidal signal E must be postulated, giving a sinusoidal value for vbe = Vbe.
