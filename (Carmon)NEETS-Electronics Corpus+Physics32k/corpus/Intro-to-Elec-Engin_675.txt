MOSFETs
The metal-oxide-semiconductor construction leads to the name MOSFET, which is also known
as insulated-gate FET or IGFET. One type of construction results in the depletion MOSFET, the
other in the enhancement MOSFET. The names are derived from the way in which channels
are formed and operated. Both n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs are available in either type.
