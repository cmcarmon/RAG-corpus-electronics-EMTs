Breadboards have their limitations, though. First and foremost, they are intended for tem-
porary construction only. If you pick up a breadboard, turn it upside-down, and shake it, any
components plugged into it are sure to loosen, and may fall out of their respective holes. Also,
breadboards are limited to fairly low-current (less than 1 amp) circuits. Those spring clips
have a small contact area, and thus cannot support high currents without excessive heating.
