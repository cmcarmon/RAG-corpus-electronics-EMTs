Desirable Attributes of a Computer Model
A computer model must have some minimum set of basic properties to be useful. From the long list of attributes
that  might  be  desired,  we  consider:  (1)  accuracy,  (2)  efﬁciency,  and  (3)  utility  the  three  most  important  as
summarized in Table 45.3. Accuracy is put foremost because results of insufﬁcient or unknown accuracy have
uncertain  value  and  may  even  be  harmful.  On  the  other  hand,  a  code  that  produces  accurate  results  but  at
unacceptable  cost  will  have  hardly  any  more  value.  Finally,  a  code’s  applicability  in  terms  of  the  depth  and
breadth of the problems for which it can be used determines its utility.
