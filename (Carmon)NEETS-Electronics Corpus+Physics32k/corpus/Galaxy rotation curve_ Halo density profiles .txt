In order to accommodate a flat rotation curve, a density profile for a galaxy and its environs must be different than one that is centrally concentrated. Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law implies that the spherically symmetric, radial density profile ρ(r) is:

{\displaystyle \rho (r)={\frac {v(r)^{2}}{4\pi Gr^{2}}}\left(1+2~{\frac {d\log ~v(r)}{d\log ~r}}\right)}

where v(r) is the radial orbital velocity profile and G is the gravitational constant. This profile closely matches the expectations of a singular isothermal sphere profile where if v(r) is approximately constant then the density ρ ∝ r−2 to some inner "core radius" where the density is then assumed constant. Observations do not comport with such a simple profile, as reported by Navarro, Frenk, and White in a seminal 1996 paper.
The authors then remarked, that a "gently changing logarithmic slope" for a density profile function could also accommodate approximately flat rotation curves over large scales. They found the famous Navarro–Frenk–White profile which is consistent both with N-body simulations and observations given by

{\displaystyle \rho (r)={\frac {\rho _{0}}{{\frac {r}{R_{s}}}\left(1~+~{\frac {r}{R_{s}}}\right)^{2}}}}

where the central density, ρ0, and the scale radius, Rs, are parameters that vary from halo to halo. Because the slope of the density profile diverges at the center, other alternative profiles have been proposed, for example, the Einasto profile which has exhibited better agreement with certain dark matter halo simulations.
Observations of orbit velocities in spiral galaxies suggest a mass structure according to:

{\displaystyle v(r)=(r\,d\Phi /dr)^{1/2}}

with Φ the galaxy gravitational potential.
Since observations of galaxy rotation do not match the distribution expected from application of Kepler's laws, they do not match the distribution of luminous matter. This implies that spiral galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter or, in alternative, the existence of exotic physics in action on galactic scales. The additional invisible component becomes progressively more conspicuous in each galaxy at outer radii and among galaxies in the less luminous ones.
Cosmology tells us that about 26% of the mass of the Universe is composed of dark matter, a hypothetical type of matter which does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter dominates the gravitational potential of galaxies and cluster of galaxies. Galaxies are baryonic condensations of stars and gas (namely H and He) that lie at the centers of much larger dark haloes of dark matter, affected by a gravitational instability caused by primordial density fluctuations.
The main goal has become to understand the nature and the history of these ubiquitous dark haloes by investigating the properties of the galaxies they contain (i.e. their luminosities, kinematics, sizes, and morphologies). The measurement of the kinematics (their positions, velocities and accelerations) of the observable stars and gas has become a tool to investigate the nature of dark matter, as to its content and distribution relative to that of the various baryonic components of those galaxies.
