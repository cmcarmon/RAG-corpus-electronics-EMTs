To measure DC voltage, set the function switch to 
1DC. With the function switch set at 1DC, the com-
mon jack is negative and the plus jack is positive. The 
voltmeter is connected in parallel with the circuit. 
When measuring an unknown voltage, always set the 
meter to the highest range (500 volts). If the measured 
voltage is lower, a lower position can be selected. This 
procedure protects the meter from damage. Read 
the voltage on the scale marked DC. For the 2.5-volt 
range, use the 0–250 scale and divide by 100. For the 
10-volt, 50-volt, and 250-volt ranges, use the scales di-
rectly. For the 500-volt range, use the 0–50 scale and 
multiply by 10.
