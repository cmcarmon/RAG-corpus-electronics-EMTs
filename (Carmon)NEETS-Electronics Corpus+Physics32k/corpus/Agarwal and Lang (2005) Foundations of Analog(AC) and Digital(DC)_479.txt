where the two conductances in series, G3 and G4 are calculated using
Equation 2.58. Both of these expressions are the same as the first term in Equa-
tion 3.102, after some manipulation. Note that the form of Equation 3.104 is
much simpler and more insightful than the forms in Equations 3.101 and 3.102,
because the derivation in terms of the voltage-divider primitive reveals the basic
structure of the circuit. But the main point of this development is to show that
the effect of source V1 on the node voltage e1 can be found very easily by
forming a subcircuit in which V2 and I are set to zero.
