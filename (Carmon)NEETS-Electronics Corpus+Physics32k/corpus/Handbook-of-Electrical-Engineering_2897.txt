Post-Reﬂow Inspection
Final analysis of the process is performed based on the quality of the solder joints formed in the reﬂow process.
Whatever criteria may have been followed during the overall process, solder joint quality is the ﬁnal determining
factor of the correctness of the various process steps. As noted earlier, the quality level of solder joint production
is a major factor in successful board assembly. A primary criteria is the indication of wetting at the junction
of the reﬂowed solder and the part termination. This same criteria shown in Fig. 26.15 applies to both through-
hole and SMDs, with only the inspection location being different.
