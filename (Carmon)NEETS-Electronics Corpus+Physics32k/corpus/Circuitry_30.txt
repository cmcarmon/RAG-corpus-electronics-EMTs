Resistance and resistivity 
 
The  resistance  of  a  metallic  conductor  is  directly 
proportional to its length and inversely proportional 
to 
is  also  directly 
specific 
proportional 
resistance). Resistivity is defined as the resistance 
measured  between  the  opposite  faces  of  a  cube 
having sides of 1 cm. 
  The resistance, R, of a conductor is thus given by 
the formula: 
 
R = , Ã— l / A
where  R is  the  resistance  (ft),  , is  the  resistivity
(<m), l is the length (m), and A is the area (m2). 
  Table 1.5 shows the electrical properties of some 
common metals. 
 
Example 1.17 
 
A coil consists of an 8 m length of annealed copper 
wire  having  a  cross-sectional  area  of  l  mm2.
Determine the resistance of the coil.
