Connecting dozens of gates in a complex web 
of circuitry presents a bit of a timing problem.  
As the gate inputs in one stage of logic change, 
the  gate  outputs  will  change  —  but  not 
 instantaneously. (It takes some time, albeit a 
very short time, for each gate to react.) Those 
 outputs then feed the inputs to another stage of 
logic, and so on.
Complex  logic  devices  use  special  circuits 
called registers between stages of logic to hold
