where VNAME is the name of the voltage source, N+ is the node number of the positive reference,
N− is the node number of the negative reference, AC indicates that this is an ac source, VPEAK
is the peak value of the voltage, and PHASE is the phase angle of the source in degrees. Current
sources, which must begin with the letter I, are speciﬁed in a similar manner, with the reference
direction for the current source pointing from the ﬁrst node number given in the statement to the
second node number.
