In a fully systolic SFG, each edge is associated with regis-
ter(s). The clock cycle time of each SFG node is determined by
its critical path. The delay of the critical path is determined by
the maximum computation delay on a zero-register path. On
the other hand, a recurrent algorithm is constrained by its
iteration period analogous to a clock period. Other than min-
imizing the iteration period or cycle time, both spaceâ€“time
mapping and multiprocessor implementation try to minimize
the number of PEs/processors, respectively.
