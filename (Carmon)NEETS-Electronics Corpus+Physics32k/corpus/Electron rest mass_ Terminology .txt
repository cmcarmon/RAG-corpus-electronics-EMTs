The term "rest mass" + kinetic energy comes from the need to take account of the effects of special relativity on the apparent (or "observed") mass of an electron. It is impossible to "weigh" a stationary electron, and so all practical measurements must be carried out on moving electrons. The same is true with any other sub-atomic particle. For particles like photons or gluons the situation is even more problematic since the very concept of a stationary or "at rest" massless particle lacks meaning.
