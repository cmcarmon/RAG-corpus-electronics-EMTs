The total number of computations for the m scalar meas-
urement updates is m( 3
2 n) plus m scalar divisions. Thus,
it can be seen that m scalar updates are computationally
cheaper for any m.
(k) and
PÃ¾(k) will be identical to the values that would have been
computed by the corresponding vector measurement update.
The state feedback measurement vectors K i corresponding to
the scalar updates are not equal to the columns of the state
feedback gain matrix that would result from the corresponding
vector update. This is due to the different ordering of the
updates affecting the error covariance matrix Pi at the inter-
mediate steps during the scalar updates.
