Instrument Transformers
These are generally of two types, potential transformers (PTs) and current transformers (CTs).
They are designed in such a way that the former may be regarded as having an ideal potential
ratio, whereas the latter has an ideal current ratio. The accuracy of measurement is quite important
for ITs that are commonly used in ac circuits to supply instruments, protective relays, and control
devices.
