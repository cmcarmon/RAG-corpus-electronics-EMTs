The technique for overlapping conﬁguration and computa-
tion (see Section 3.2, Figure 3.2) can be also extended to cover
various architectural templates; this extension will enable the
reconﬁguration of one pipeline to another with a different
number of pipeline stages or to change a linear pipeline into
a tree-shaped architecture. Frequently, there are multiple ways
of reconﬁguring designs, and it is important to evaluate the
trade-offs involved.
