True Room-Temperature Detectors
True room-temperature detectors are distinguished from cryogenic semiconductors by the magnitude of the
energy gap that separates the normally vacant conduction band from the highest Ô¨Ålled band. If this energy gap
is small, as in the case of germanium (0.67 eV), electrons can be thermally stimulated across the bandgap at
room  temperature.  The  resultant  current  competes  with  the  gamma-ray  generated  signal,  precluding  room-
temperature operation of germanium (and many high-resolution applications of silicon). Thermally induced
