The term serape originates from a piece of clothing worn by people of Latin-American countries, also known by the same name. A serape is a brightly colored blanket which hangs around the shoulders and crosses diagonally across the anterior portion of the trunk. The general direction of how a serape is worn is similar to the direction of the pull of four muscles in the same area. The serape effect is this group of four muscles working together to produce an opposition of the rib cage and pelvis in the wind-up of a motion, and finally generate a large summation of internal forces from the snap-back. The serape effect is prevalent in ballistic motions like throwing, kicking and swinging.
