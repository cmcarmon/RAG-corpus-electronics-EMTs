2. Deenergize the circuit and disconnect all leads on the differential except leads S2 and S3 when 
you use the 78-volt (10.2 volts for 26-volt units) supply from the transmitting unit to zero the 
differential. Set the voltmeter to its 0- to 250-volt scale and connect it as shown in view A of 
figure 1-39. If the 78-volts is not available from the transmitter or from an auto transformer, you 
may use a 115-volt source instead. If you use 115 volts instead of 78 volts, do not leave the 
synchro connected for more than 2 minutes or it will overheat and may become permanently 
damaged.
