Servo theory can now be used to derive the equations for the output signal phase relative to the reference
input signal phase. Because the VCO control voltage sets the frequency of the oscillation (rather than the phase),
this will produce a pure integration when writing this expression. Several of the components of the PLL have
a Ô¨Åxed gain associated with them. These are the

calculated using Eq. (76.1) and is then used in the following equations to calculate the loop transfer function.
