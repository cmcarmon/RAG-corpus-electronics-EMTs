Pulse Generator
The pulse generator is the core of the ICD system. It consists of the batteries, capacitors, and accompanying
electronics enclosed in a hermetically sealed titanium can. The can may be used as a return electrode. A header,
typically made of epoxy, is attached to the can and provides the link from the electronics to the leads via silicone-
sealed ceramic feedthroughs. The size of the pulse generator has steadily declined since the introduction of the
ICD  and  is  currently  around  40  cc.  Signiﬁcant  efforts  are  underway  to  further  reduce  the  size  of  the  pulse
generator in order to increase patient comfort. As research in deﬁbrillation progresses, more efﬁcient deﬁbril-
lation strategies will no doubt be developed and allow the size to be decreased further. Currently, the major
barriers to size reduction are the battery and capacitor size required to create waveforms capable of ventricular
deﬁbrillation. In addition, designing the electronics for a system that can measure cardiac signals on the order
of 100 µV and produce high-energy waveforms on the order of 750 V and 40 A, all within the same small space,
presents a signiﬁcant engineering challenge. A problem associated with this includes high-voltage arcing among
internal components. To prevent this, nitrogen gas is sealed inside the can because of its high breakdown voltage
barrier.
