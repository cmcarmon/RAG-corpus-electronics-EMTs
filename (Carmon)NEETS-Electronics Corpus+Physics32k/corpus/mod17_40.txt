When the wireless (radiotelegraph) was invented, the Navy saw a possible use for it. It could be used 
for communications from shore stations to ships along the coast. In 1899, the first official naval radio 
message was sent from ship to shore. It only traveled a distance of 20 miles but that was a start. The next 
advance was in 1916 when the Navy first used radiotelephone between ships. Three years later the first 
airborne radio was used to communicate with a ground station. In the early years, communications was 
not the best because of poor tuning techniques. Receivers often did not pick up the signal. This problem 
was almost eliminated in 1931 when the first superheterodyne receivers were installed in the fleet. In 
1944, another important event took place. The first successful radio teletypewriter transmissions between 
ships were completed. The first successful use of radiophoto (facsimile) occurred in 1945 with the 
transmission of the surrender document signing that ended World War II. Naval communications has 
grown tremendously in size and complexity since then.
