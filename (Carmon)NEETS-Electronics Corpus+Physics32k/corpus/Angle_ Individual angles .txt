Angles smaller than a right angle (less than 90°) are called acute angles ("acute" meaning "sharp").
An angle equal to 1/4 turn (90° or π/2 radians) is called a right angle. Two lines that form a right angle are said to be normal, orthogonal, or perpendicular.
Angles larger than a right angle and smaller than a straight angle (between 90° and 180°) are called obtuse angles ("obtuse" meaning "blunt").
An angle equal to 1/2 turn (180° or π radians) is called a straight angle.
Angles larger than a straight angle but less than 1 turn (between 180° and 360°) are called reflex angles.
An angle equal to 1 turn (360° or 2π radians) is called a full angle, complete angle, or a perigon.
Angles that are not right angles or a multiple of a right angle are called oblique angles.
