After the encounter, preliminary data will be sent to Earth on January 1 and 2, 2019, to transmit high priority data. On January 9, New Horizons will return to a spin-stabilized mode, to prepare to send the remainder of its data back to Earth. This downlink is expected to continue through most of 2019.
