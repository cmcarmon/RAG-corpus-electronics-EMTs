waveforms are short-term quasiperiodic, with the period de-
termined by the frequency of vocal-fold vibration—the pitch
frequency.6 Accordingly, voice speech is modeled as a deter-
ministic process. Unvoiced speech sounds are produced by
exciting the vocal tract by turbulent airﬂow at some constric-
tion in the vocal tract. The excitation source is often modeled
