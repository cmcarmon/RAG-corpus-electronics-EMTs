A MEDIUM is the vehicle through which the wave travels from one point to the next. The vehicle
that carries a wave can be just about anything. An example of a medium, already mentioned, is air. Air, as
defined by the dictionary, is the mixture of invisible, odorless, tasteless gases that surrounds the earth (the
atmosphere). Air is made up of molecules of various gases (and impurities). We will call these molecules
of air particles of air or simply particles.
