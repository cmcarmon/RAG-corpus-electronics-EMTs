where c is the speed of light in the dielectric media. The modal ﬁeld patterns for this mode are shown in Fig. 37.9.
Table 37.3 shows the cut-off frequencies of the lowest-order rectangular waveguide modes (as referenced to
the cut-off frequency of the dominant mode) when a/b = 2.1. The modal ﬁeld patterns for several lower-order
modes are shown in Fig. 37.10.
