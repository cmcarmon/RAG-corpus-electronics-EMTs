Figure 5.20: To ﬁlter a signal in the frequency domain, ﬁrst compute the DFT of the input, multiply
the result by the sampled frequency response, and ﬁnally compute the inverse DFT of the product. The
DFT’s length must be at least the sum of the input’s and unit-sample response’s duration minus one.
We calculate these discrete Fourier transforms using the fast Fourier transform algorithm, of course.
