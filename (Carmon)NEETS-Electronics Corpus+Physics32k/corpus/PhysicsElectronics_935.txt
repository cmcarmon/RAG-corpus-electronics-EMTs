Read and write operations between the CPU and memory units are the most common.
One approach is for the CPU to set the address lines and data lines and then blindly issue
the control pulses, assuming that the slave unit will respond as needed within the allowed
time. A more elegant but slightly slower technique uses a handshake which requires an
acknowledgment response from the slave before proceeding.
