as shown in Figure 12.30. Because vIN is an impulse, it vanishes for t > 0.
Therefore, Equation 12.119 reduces to a homogeneous equation for t > 0.
Thus the impulse response of the circuit is essentially a homogeneous response,
this response is identical to that studied in Subsection 12.2. In fact, as observed
in Section 10.6.4 for a first-order circuit, the role of the impulse is to establish
initial conditions for the subsequent homogeneous response.
As previously observed on several occasions, the transient behavior of an
uncharged capacitor is to act as a short circuit during the early part of a transient,
while the corresponding transient behavior of an uncharged inductor is to act
as an open circuit. Since the inductor acts as an open circuit during a sudden
transition, the impulse in vIN falls entirely across the inductor while vC remains
zero at t = 0. An important consequence of this is that the flux linkage ◦
delivered by vIN is delivered entirely to the inductor, and so iL steps to −◦/L
at t = 0. This establishes the initial conditions immediately after the impulse.
In other words, these will be our initial conditions for the rest of our analysis:
