Equivalent Input Noise
Shot noise (see below) and other noise can be modeled by equivalent thermal noise that would be generated
in an input resistor by increased temperature. Recall that the (maximum) incremental available power (output)
in a frequency bandwidth df is PWW(df ) = kTdf from Eq. (73.27). Figure 73.8(b) presents the situation. Let the
resistor be the noise source at temperature To with thermal noise W(t). Then E[W(t)2] = 4kToRdf, by Eq. (73.24)
(Nyquist’s result). Let the open circuit output noise power at RL be E[Y(t)2]. The incremental available noise
power PYY(df ) at the output (RL = R) can be considered to be due to the resistor R having a higher temperature
and an ideal (noiseless) device, usually an ampliﬁer. We must ﬁnd a temperature Te at which a pseudothermal
