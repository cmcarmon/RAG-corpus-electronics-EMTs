A variety of algorithms have been proposed for iteratively solving minimization problem (14.73) when the
signals are taken to lie in a Hilbert space. These algorithms differentiate themselves by the assumptions made
on  the  characteristics  of  the  attribute  sets  C1,  C2,  .  .  .,  Cm  in  which  the  unknown  signal  being  monitored  is
assumed to be contained. Of particular interest is the situation in which these sets are constrained to be made
up exclusively of (1) closed subspaces or translated closed subspaces (i.e., linear varieties) and (2) closed convex
sets. Some of the more important theoretical results characterizing these cases are examined in the next two
subsections.
