Integrating different software applications either in a single
processor or across a network requires detailed knowledge of
the operating systems on the connected machines. Moreover,
the use of networks requires knowledge of communication
protocols that dictate how packets of data are sent and veriÔ¨Åed.
Programming at the operating system level or at the network
level adds a layer of complexity to the process that most
control engineers would prefer to avoid. As an alternative, a
new layer, called middleware, is inserted between the operat-
ing system and the application software as shown in Figure
14.3. The middleware sets up the communication protocols
and interfaces with the operating systems for the machines on
the network to allow different software applications on the
