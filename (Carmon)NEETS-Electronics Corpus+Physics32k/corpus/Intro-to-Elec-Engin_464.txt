shown in Figure P5.3.4(b). Show that it is
desirable to choose R3, which is equal to a
parallel combination of R1 and R2. Compare
the residual output voltage to what occurs if
R3 were zero.
(c) Reconsider the circuit of part (b). Let R1 =
5 k, and R2 = 70 k. Let the op-amp bias
currents be Ib1 = 50 nA and Ib2 = 60 nA, but
otherwise let the op amp be ideal. Determine
the value of R3 that should be used. Also, when
the input signal is zero, Ô¨Ånd the residual output
offset voltage.
