In every Go-Onto-Target system there are three subsystems:

Target tracker
Missile tracker
Guidance computer

The way these three subsystems are distributed between the missile and the launcher result in two different categories:

Remote Control Guidance: The guidance computer is on the launcher. The target tracker is also placed on the launching platform.
Homing Guidance: The guidance computers are in the missile and in the target tracker.
