If the switch in figure 3-23 is closed for a given time, the quantity (Q) of electricity leaving the
battery can be computed by using the equation Q = IT. The electricity leaves the battery and goes into the
line, where a charge is built up on the capacitors. The amount of this charge is computed by using the
equation Q = CE.
