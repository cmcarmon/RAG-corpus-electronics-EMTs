Schematic	symbols are symbols used to repre-
sent electrical and electronic devices in a schematic 
diagram for an electrical or electronic circuit. The 
 international	electrotechnical	commission	
(iec)	is responsible for keeping the symbols current, 
removing old symbols from use and adding new sym-
bols as new technological devices emerge. These sym-
bols can vary from country to country but are now, to 
a large extent, internationally standardized. There are 
several international standards for schematic symbols 
in schematic diagrams. Appendix 13â€”Digital Logic 
Symbols shows several standards. This textbook 
uses American (MIL/ANSI) symbols for schematic 
diagrams.
