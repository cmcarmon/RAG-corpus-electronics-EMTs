• Suitable  predeﬁned  numerical  models  have  not  yet  been  developed  for  certain  types  of  devices  or
electrical  phenomena.  The  software  user  may  be  required,  therefore,  to  create  his  or  her  own  models
out of other models which are available in the simulator. (An example is the solid-state thyristor which
may be created from a NPN and PNP bipolar transistor.)
