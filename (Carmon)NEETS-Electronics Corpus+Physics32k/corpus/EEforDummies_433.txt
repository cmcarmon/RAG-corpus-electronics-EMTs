Interpreting capacitor symbols
Figure 7‐5 shows the circuit symbols for different types of capacitors. There 
are two commonly used capacitor circuit symbols: one with two parallel 
lines (representing the capacitor plates) and the other with one line and 
one curve. The curved side represents the more negative side of a polarized 
capacitor; however, some folks use the two types of symbols interchange-
ably. Usually, if a circuit has a polarized capacitor, you’ll see a plus sign (+) 
on one side of the capacitor symbol, showing you how to orient the capacitor 
in the circuit. An arrow through either type of symbol represents a variable 
capacitor.
