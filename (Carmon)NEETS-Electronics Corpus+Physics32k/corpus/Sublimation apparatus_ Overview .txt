A typical sublimation apparatus separates a mix of appropriate solid materials in a vessel in which it applies heat under reduced pressure or vacuum. If the material is not at first solid, then it freezes under the reduced pressure. Conditions are so chosen that the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface, leaving the non-volatile residual impurities or solid products behind.
The form of the cooled surface often is a so-called cold finger. If the operation is a batch process, then the sublimed material can be collected from the cooled surface once heating ceases and the vacuum is released.
Among the advantages of applying the principle to certain materials, are the comparatively low working temperatures and reduced exposure to gases such as oxygen that otherwise might harm certain classes of desired products.
