Semiconductor LDs emit coherent light. LDs produce light waves with a fixed-phase relationship
(both spatial and temporal) between points on the electromagnetic wave. Light waves having a fixed-
phase relationship are referred to as coherent light. Stimulated emission of light is discussed later in this
chapter. Since semiconductor LDs emit more focused light than LEDs, they are able to launch optical
power into both single mode and multimode optical fibers. However, LDs are usually used only in single
mode fiber systems because they require more complex driver circuitry and cost more than LEDs.
