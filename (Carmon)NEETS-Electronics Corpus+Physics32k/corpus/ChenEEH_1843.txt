RTCP is a control protocol that works in conjunction with
RTP and provides participants with useful statistics about the
number of packets sent, number of packets lost, interarrival
jitter, and round trip time. This information can be used by the
sources to adjust their data rate. Other information, such as
e-mail address, name, and phone number are included in the
RTCP packets and allow all users to know the identities of the
other users for that session.
