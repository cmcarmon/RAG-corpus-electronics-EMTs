Solution 
 
(a) I1 and I2 both flow towards Node A so, applying 
 
our  polarity  convention,  they  must  both  be 
positive.  Now, assuming that a current I5 flows 
 
between  A  and  B    and  that  this  current  flows 
 
away from the junction (obvious because I1 and 
 
I2 both flow towards the junction)  we arrive at 
 
the 
 
following  Kirchhoffâ€™s  Current  Law 
equation: 
 
 
+I1 + I2 4I5 = 0
From which: 
I5 = I1 + I2 = 1.5 + 2.7 = 4.2 A
