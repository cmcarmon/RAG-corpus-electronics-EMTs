In 1862, Lord Kelvin calculated the age of the Earth by assuming that Earth had formed as a completely molten object, and determined the amount of time it would take for the near-surface to cool to its present temperature. Since uniformitarianism required a much older Earth, there was a contradiction. Eventually, the additional heat sources within the Earth were discovered, allowing for a much older age. This section is about a similar paradox in current geology, called the thermal catastrophe.
The thermal catastrophe of the Earth can be demonstrated by solving the above equations for the evolution of the mantle with




Q

cmb

0


{\displaystyle Q_{\text{cmb}}=0}
. The catastrophe is defined as when the mean mantle temperature




T

{\displaystyle T_{\text{man}}}
exceeds the mantle solidus so that the entire mantle melts. Using the geochemically preferred Urey ratio of

3


{\displaystyle Ur=1/3}
and the geodynamically preferred cooling exponent of




beta

{\displaystyle {\text{beta}}=1/3}
the mantle temperature reaches the mantle solidus (i.e. a catastrophe) in 1-2 Ga. This result is clearly unacceptable because geologic evidence for a solid mantle exists as far back as 4 Ga (and possibly further). Hence, the thermal catastrophe problem is the foremost paradox in the thermal history of the Earth.
