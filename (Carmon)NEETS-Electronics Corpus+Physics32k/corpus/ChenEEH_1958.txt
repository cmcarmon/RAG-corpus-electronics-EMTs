. The dynamic method shows considerable improvement
over the static method (Hanchek and Dutt, 1996a, 1996b,
1998) for all the different transition costs (TCs). The
static method has a track overhead of 34% with its best
combination routing heuristics. The dynamic method’s
overheads are 25.96% for a worst-case fault pattern
and 15.58% for average-case patterns. This represents a
24–54% improvement over the static method.
