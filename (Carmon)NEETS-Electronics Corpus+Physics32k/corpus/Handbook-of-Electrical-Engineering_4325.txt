Figure  42.4  [Palais,  1992]  shows  a  mode  chart  for  a  symmetrical  slab  waveguide  obtained  by  solving
Eqs. (42.13a)  and  (42.13b).  For  the TEm modes,  the  E ﬁeld  is  transverse  to  the  direction  (z)  of  propagation,
while the H ﬁeld lies in a plane parallel to the z axis. For the TMm modes, the reverse is the case. The highest-
order mode that can propagate has a value m given by the integer part of
