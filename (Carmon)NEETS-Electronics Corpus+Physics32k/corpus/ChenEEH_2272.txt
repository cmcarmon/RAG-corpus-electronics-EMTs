For a lossy medium, the plane wave decays as it propagates
because k00 > 0. The depth of penetration, dp, is deﬁned as the
distance required to reduce the ﬁeld level by a factor of
e  2:71828, so the ﬁeld is 36.788% of the starting value (the
power is reduced by a factor of e2 or is at a level of 13.534% of
the starting value). The depth of penetration is given as:
