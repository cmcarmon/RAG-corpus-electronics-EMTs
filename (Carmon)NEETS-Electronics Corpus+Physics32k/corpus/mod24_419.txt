Fiber optic couplers can be either active or passive devices. The difference between active and
passive couplers is that a passive coupler redistributes the optical signal without optical-to-electrical
conversion. Active couplers are electronic devices that split or combine the signal electrically and use
fiber optic detectors and sources for input and output.
