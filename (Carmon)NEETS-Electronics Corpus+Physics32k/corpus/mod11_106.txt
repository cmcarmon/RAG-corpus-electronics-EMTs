The output of any klystron (regardless of the number of cavities used) is developed by velocity 
modulation of the electron beam. The electrons that are accelerated by the cathode pulse are acted upon 
by rf fields developed across the input and middle cavities. Some electrons are accelerated, some are 
decelerated, and some are unaffected. Electron reaction depends on the amplitude and polarity of the 
fields across the cavities when the electrons pass the cavity gaps. During the time the electrons are 
traveling through the drift space between the cavities, the accelerated electrons overtake the decelerated 
electrons to form bunches. As a result, bunches of electrons arrive at the output cavity at the proper 
instant during each cycle of the rf field and deliver energy to the output cavity.
