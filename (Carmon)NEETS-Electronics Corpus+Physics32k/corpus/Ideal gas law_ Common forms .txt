{\displaystyle PV=nRT=Nk_{\text{B}}T,}

where:




P


{\displaystyle P}
is the pressure of the gas,




V


{\displaystyle V}
is the volume of the gas,




n


{\displaystyle n}
is the amount of substance of gas (also known as number of moles),




N


{\displaystyle N}
is the number of gas molecules (or Avogadro constant times the amount of substance




N

A


n


{\displaystyle N_{\text{A}}n}
),




R


{\displaystyle R}
is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant,





k

B




{\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}}
is the Boltzmann constant




T


{\displaystyle T}
is the absolute temperature of the gas.
In SI units, P is measured in pascals, V is measured in cubic metres, n is measured in moles, and T in kelvins (the Kelvin scale is a shifted Celsius scale, where 0.00 K = −273.15 °C, the lowest possible temperature). R has the value 8.314 J/(K·mol) ≈ 2 cal/(K·mol), or 0.08206 L·atm/(mol·K).
