Since the elements of an electric circuit can be interconnected in sev-
eral  ways,  we  need  to  understand  some  basic  concepts  of  network
topology.  To  differentiate  between  a  circuit  and  a  network,  we  may
regard a network as an interconnection of elements or devices, whereas
a  circuit  is  a  network  providing  one  or  more  closed  paths.  The  con-
vention, when addressing network topology, is to use the word network
rather than circuit. We do this even though the word network and cir-
cuit mean the same thing when used in this context. In network topol-
ogy,  we  study  the  properties  relating  to  the  placement  of  elements  in
the network and the geometric conÔ¨Åguration of the network. Such ele-
ments include branches, nodes, and loops.
