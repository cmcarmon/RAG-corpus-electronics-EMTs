the Ô¨Årst magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant and Ms is the saturation magnetization.
Shape Anisotropy
A spherical particle has no shape anisotropy, i.e., all directions are equally easy (or hard). For particles (having
low  crystalline  anisotropy)  of  any  other  shape,  the  longest  dimension  is  the  easy  direction  and  the  shortest
dimension is the hardest direction of magnetization. Thus, a needle-shaped (acicular) particle will tend to be
magnetized along the long dimension, whereas a particle in the form of a disk will have the axis of the disk as
its hard direction, while any direction in the plane of the disk will be equally easy (assuming that shape is the
dominant anisotropy).
