Three electrical connections are made to a JFET 
(Figure 32-2). One lead is connected to the substrate 
to form the gate (G). One lead is connected to each 
end of the channel to form the source	(S) and the 
drainÂ (D). It does not matter which lead is  attached to 
the source or drain, because the channel is symmetrical.
