pole motor got its name from these shading bands. Induced currents in the shading coil cause the
ﬂux in the shaded portion of the pole to lag the ﬂux in the other portion in time. The result is
then like a rotating ﬁeld moving in the direction from the unshaded to the shaded portion of the
pole. A low starting torque is produced. A typical torque-speed characteristic is shown in Figure
13.2.16(b). Shaded-pole motors have a rather low efﬁciency.
