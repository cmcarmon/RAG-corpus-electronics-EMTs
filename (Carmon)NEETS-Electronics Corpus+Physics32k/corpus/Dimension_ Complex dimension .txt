Complex dimensions appear in the study of complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. A complex number (x + iy) has a real part x and an imaginary part y, where x and y are real numbers. A single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions. For example, an ordinary two-dimensional spherical surface, when given a complex metric, becomes a Riemann sphere of one complex dimension.
