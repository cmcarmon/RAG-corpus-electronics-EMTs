Ion-Implanted Detector
A simpliﬁed representation of ion-implanted detector fabrication is shown in Fig. 116.17. The ﬁrst successful
implementation of silicon planar processing to silicon detectors was reported by Kemmer [24]. The procedure
starts with the thermal growth of an oxide ﬁlm on a high-purity, n-type silicon wafer. Windows are then opened
in  the  oxide  by  photolithographic  techniques.  The  front  contact  area  is  implanted  with  boron  to  form  the
rectifying contact, and arsenic is implanted into the backside. The wafer is then annealed to activate the implant,
and  aluminum  is  evaporated  on  both  sides  to  reduce  sheet  resistivity.  Typical  entrance  windows  are  50  nm
silicon equivalent. Electrical connections are made by wire bonding to the aluminum layers. Finished detectors
are canned in a manner similar to surface barrier detectors. More than one detector can be fabricated on the
same wafer using the appropriate masks during photolithography. In fact, quite elaborate detector geometries
can be achieved via photolithography. The detector in Fig. 116.17 is actually a strip type.
