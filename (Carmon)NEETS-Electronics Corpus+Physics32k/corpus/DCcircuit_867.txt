An electromechanical generator is a device capable of producing electrical power from mechan-
ical energy, usually the turning of a shaft. When not connected to a load resistance, genera-
tors will generate voltage roughly proportional to shaft speed. With precise construction and
design, generators can be built to produce very precise voltages for certain ranges of shaft
speeds, thus making them well-suited as measurement devices for shaft speed in mechanical
equipment. A generator specially designed and constructed for this use is called a tachometer
or tachogenerator. Often, the word ”tach” (pronounced ”tack”) is used rather than the whole
word.
