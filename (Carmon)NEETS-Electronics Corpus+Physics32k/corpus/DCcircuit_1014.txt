In Millman’s Theorem, the circuit is re-drawn as a parallel network of branches, each branch
containing a resistor or series battery/resistor combination. Millman’s Theorem is applicable
only to those circuits which can be re-drawn accordingly. Here again is our example circuit
used for the last two analysis methods:
