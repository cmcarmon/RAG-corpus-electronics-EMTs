Information Rates
Tens of millions of users access the Internet daily via standard telephone lines. Modems operating at data rates
of up to 28,800 bits per second enable the transmission of text, audio, color images, and even low-resolution
video. The progression in modern technology for the standard telephone channel shown in Fig. 73.12 exhibits,
if not the exponential increases ubiquitous in computer engineering, then a steady slope of abut 825 bits per
second per year.
