substantially linear, became distinctly curved at one 
end.  Many  graphs  are  curved  rather  than  linear. 
One  common  type  of  curve  is  the  square  law.  To 
put  this  into  context,  consider  the  relationship 
between the power developed in a load resistor and 
the current applied to it. Assuming that the load has 
a resistance  of  15  W  we  could  easily  construct  a 
table  showing  corresponding  values  of  power  and 
current, as shown below:
