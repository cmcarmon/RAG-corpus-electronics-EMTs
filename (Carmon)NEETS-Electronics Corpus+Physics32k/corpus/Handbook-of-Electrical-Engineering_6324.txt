Proposed Systems
In the early 1990s, four digital HDTV approaches were submitted for FCC testing. The four were proposed by
General  Instrument  Corporation,  the Advanced  Television  Research  Consortium  (composed  of  NBC,  David
Sarnoff  Research  Center,  Philips  Consumer  Electronics,  and  Thomson  Consumer  Electronics,  Inc.),  Zenith
Electronics  in  cooperation  with  AT&T  Bell  Labs  and  AT&T  Microelectronics,  and  the  American  Television
Alliance (General Instrument Corporation and MIT). There were many common aspects to the four proposals,
but  major  differences  existed  in  the  data  compression  approaches.  The  data  compression  techniques  can  be
viewed as two-dimensional extensions of techniques used in voice encoding.
