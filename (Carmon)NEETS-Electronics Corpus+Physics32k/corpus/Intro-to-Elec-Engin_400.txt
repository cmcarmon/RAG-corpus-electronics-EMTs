Note that although the ampliﬁer’s open-circuit voltage ampliﬁcation A is only unity, substantial
power gain is obtained in this case since the current gain is greater than unity and GP = GVGI.
In applications of microwave technology, the function of the ampliﬁer is to magnify very small
power to a measurable level with as little random noise as possible. The source signal may be
from a radio telescope, and the available power may be determined by the power captured by the
antenna dish.
