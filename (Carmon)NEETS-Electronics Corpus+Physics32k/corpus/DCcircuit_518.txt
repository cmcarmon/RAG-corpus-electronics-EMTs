A soldered or wire-wrapped circuit is considered permanent: that is, it is unlikely to fall
apart accidently. However, these construction techniques are sometimes considered too per-
manent. If anyone wishes to replace a component or change the circuit in any substantial
way, they must invest a fair amount of time undoing the connections. Also, both soldering and
wire-wrapping require specialized tools which may not be immediately available.
