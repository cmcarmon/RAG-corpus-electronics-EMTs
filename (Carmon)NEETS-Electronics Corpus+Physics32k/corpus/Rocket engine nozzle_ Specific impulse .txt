Thrust is the force that moves a rocket through the air or space. Thrust is generated by the propulsion system of the rocket through the application of Newton's third law of motion: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction". A gas or working fluid is accelerated out the rear of the rocket engine nozzle, and the rocket is accelerated in the opposite direction. The thrust of a rocket engine nozzle can be defined as:

and for perfectly expanded nozzles, this reduces to:

The specific impulse




I

sp




{\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}
is the ratio of the thrust produced to the weight flow of the propellants. It is a measure of the fuel efficiency of a rocket engine. In English Engineering units it can be obtained as

In certain cases, where

{\displaystyle p_{\text{e}}}
equals

{\displaystyle p_{\text{o}}}
, the formula becomes

In cases where this may not be so, since for a rocket nozzle

{\displaystyle p_{\text{e}}}

{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}}
, it is possible to define a constant quantity that is the vacuum

{\displaystyle F=I_{\text{sp}}({\text{vac}})g_{\text{o}}{\dot {m}}-A_{\text{e}}p_{\text{o}},}

which is simply the vacuum thrust minus the force of the ambient atmospheric pressure acting over the exit plane.
Essentially then, for rocket nozzles, the ambient pressure acting on the engine cancels except over the exit plane of the rocket engine in a rearward direction, while the exhaust jet generates forward thrust.
