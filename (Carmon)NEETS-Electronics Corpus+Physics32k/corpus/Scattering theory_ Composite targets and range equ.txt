When the target is a set of many scattering centers whose relative position varies unpredictably, it is customary to think of a range equation whose arguments take different forms in different application areas. In the simplest case consider an interaction that removes particles from the "unscattered beam" at a uniform rate that is proportional to the incident flux

where Q is an interaction coefficient and x is the distance traveled in the target.
The above ordinary first-order differential equation has solutions of the form:

{\displaystyle I=I_{o}e^{-Q\Delta x}=I_{o}e^{-{\frac {\Delta x}{\lambda }}}=I_{o}e^{-\sigma (\eta \Delta x)}=I_{o}e^{-{\frac {\rho \Delta x}{\tau }}},}

where Io is the initial flux, path length Δx ≡ x − xo, the second equality defines an interaction mean free path λ, the third uses the number of targets per unit volume η to define an area cross-section σ, and the last uses the target mass density ρ to define a density mean free path τ. Hence one converts between these quantities via Q = 1/λ = ησ = ρ/τ, as shown in the figure at left.
In electromagnetic absorption spectroscopy, for example, interaction coefficient (e.g. Q in cm−1) is variously called opacity, absorption coefficient, and attenuation coefficient. In nuclear physics, area cross-sections (e.g. σ in barns or units of 10−24 cm2), density mean free path (e.g. τ in grams/cm2), and its reciprocal the mass attenuation coefficient (e.g. in cm2/gram) or area per nucleon are all popular, while in electron microscopy the inelastic mean free path (e.g. λ in nanometers) is often discussed instead.
