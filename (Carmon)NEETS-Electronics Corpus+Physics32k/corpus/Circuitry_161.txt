c
where Vs, is the supply voltage, t is the time, C is 
the capacitance, and R is the resistance. 
  The capacitor voltage  will  fall to approximately 
37%  of  the  initial  voltage  in  a  time  equal  to  the 
time  constant.  At  the  end  of  the  next  interval  of 
time equal to the time constant (i.e. after an elapsed 
time equal to 2CR) the voltage will have fallen by 
37% of the remainder, and so on. 
In theory, the capacitor will never become fully 
 
discharged.  However,  after  a  period  of  time  equal 
to  5CR,  however,  the  capacitor  voltage  will  to  all 
intents and purposes be zero.  
  At  this  point  the  capacitor  voltage  will  have 
fallen below 1% of its initial value. At this point we 
can consider it to be fully discharged. 
  As with charging, the current in the capacitor, i,
varies with time, t, according to the relationship:
