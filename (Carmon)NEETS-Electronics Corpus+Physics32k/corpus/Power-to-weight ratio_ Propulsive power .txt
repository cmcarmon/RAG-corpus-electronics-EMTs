{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (t)\;}
is linear force – or thrust – applied upon the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)\;}
is velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } (t)\;}
is angular velocity of the center of mass of the body, changing with time.
In propulsion, power is only delivered if the powerplant is in motion, and is transmitted to cause the body to be in motion. It is typically assumed here that mechanical transmission allows the powerplant to operate at peak output power. This assumption allows engine tuning to trade power band width and engine mass for transmission complexity and mass. Electric motors do not suffer from this tradeoff, instead trading their high torque for traction at low speed. The power advantage or power-to-weight ratio is then
