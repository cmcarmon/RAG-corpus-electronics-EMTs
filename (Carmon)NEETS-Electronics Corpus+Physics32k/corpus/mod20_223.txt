FLIP-FLOPÂ—A device having two stable states and two input terminals (or types of input signals), each of 
which corresponds with one of the two states. The circuit remains in either state until caused to change 
to the other state by application of a voltage pulse. A similar bistable device with an input that allows it 
to act as a single-stage binary counter [13].
