Inductors are commonly constructed by wrapping many
turns of wire around a core. This is an efﬁcient method of
increasing the inductance since for the same amount of cur-
rent, the ﬂux through (or ‘‘linking’’) the open surface bounded
by the contour is approximately proportional to the number
of wire turns. Accordingly, for loop i with Ni identical and
‘‘tightly wound’’ turns, the ﬂux linkage is deﬁned as:
