Pressure develops due to:
Water elevation difference, water flowing from higher elevation to lower elevation and causing a velocity head, or with water flow, as exemplified in the Bernoulli's energy equations.
Hydrostatic water pressure, resulting from the weight of material above the point measured.
Osmotic pressure, inhomogeneous aggregation of ion concentrations, which causes a force in water particles as they attract by the molecular laws of attraction.
Adsorption pressure, attraction of surrounding soil particles to one another by adsorbed water films.
