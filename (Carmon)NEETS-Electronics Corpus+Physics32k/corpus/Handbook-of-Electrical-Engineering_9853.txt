We can attempt to combine the lag network with the lead network into an all-passive structure called a lag-
lead network. Generally we obtain better results than we can achieve using either a lead or a lag network. We
will  consider  design  using  lag-lead  networks  in  our  next  subsection  as  well  as  more  complex  composite
equalization networks.
