The MOSFET is normally constructed so that it operates in one of two basic modes: the depletion 
mode or the enhancement mode. The depletion mode MOSFET has a heavily doped channel and uses 
reverse bias on the gate to cause a depletion of current carriers in the channel. The JFET also operates in 
this manner. The enhancement mode MOSFET has a lightly doped channel and uses forward bias to
