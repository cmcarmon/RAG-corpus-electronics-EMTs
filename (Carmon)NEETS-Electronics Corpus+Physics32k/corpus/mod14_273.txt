In view B, gate 3 has been changed to an AND gate. The outputs of gates 1 and 2 do not change, but
the output expression of gate 3 does. In this case, the gate 3 output expression is (R+S)(T+V). This
expression is spoken, "quantity R OR S AND quantity T OR V." The parentheses are used to separate the
input terms and to indicate the AND function. Without the parentheses the output expression would read
R+ST+V, which is representative of the circuit in view C. As you can see, this is not the same circuit as
the one depicted in view B. It is very important that the Boolean expressions be written and spoken
correctly.
