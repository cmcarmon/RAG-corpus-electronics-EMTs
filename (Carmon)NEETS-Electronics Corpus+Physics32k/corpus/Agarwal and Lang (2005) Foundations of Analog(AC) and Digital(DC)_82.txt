Notice also that the orientation and shape of the wires are not relevant
to our computation. We could even twist them or knot them in any way.
Assuming for now that the wires are ideal conductors and offer zero resistance,3
we can rewrite the bulb circuit as shown in Figure 1.4b using lumped circuit
equivalents for the battery and the bulb resistance, which are connected by ideal
wires. Accordingly, Figure 1.4b is called the lumped circuit abstraction of the
lightbulb circuit. If the battery supplies a constant voltage V and has zero internal
resistance, and if the resistance of the bulb is R, we can use simple algebra to
compute the current flowing through the bulb as
