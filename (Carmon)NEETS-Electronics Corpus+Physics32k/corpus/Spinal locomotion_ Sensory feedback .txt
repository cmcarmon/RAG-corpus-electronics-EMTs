The sensory feedback originates from muscles, joints, tendons and skin afferents as well as from special senses and dynamically adapts the locomotor pattern of spinal cord to the requirements of the environment. These afferent sensory receptors perceive deformation of tissue the amount of pressure (stretch or simply, placement), direction of movement, speed and velocity at which movement is occurring.
