There are two basic types of voltage regulators: 
shunt voltage regulators and series voltage 
regulators. They are named for the method by which 
they are connected with the load. The shunt regula-
tor is connected in parallel with the load, whereas the 
series regulator is connected in series with the load. 
Series regulators are more popular than shunt regula-
tors because they are more efficient and dissipate less 
power. The shunt regulator also acts as a control de-
vice, protecting the regulator from a short in the load. 
Figure 36-20 shows a basic zener diode regulator 
circuit. This is a shunt regulator. The zener diode is 
connected in series with a resistor. The input  voltage, 
unregulated DC voltage, is applied across both the 
 zener diode and the resistor so as to make the  zener
