Grooved media of optical storage: A disk embossed with grooves of either the concentric-ring type or the
spiral type. If grooves are used as tracks, then the lands (i.e., regions between adjacent grooves) are the
guard bands. Alternatively, lands may be used as tracks, in which case the grooves act as guard bands.
In a typical grooved optical disk in use today the track width is 1.1 mm, the width of the guard band is
0.5 mm, and the groove depth is 70 nm.
