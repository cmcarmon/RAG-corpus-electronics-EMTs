The utilization of biomedical engineers offers great potential beneﬁt in the identiﬁcation of problems and
needs of our present health care delivery system that can be solved using existing engineering technology and
systems methodology. Consequently, the ﬁeld of biomedical engineering offers hope in the continuing battle
to provide high-quality health care at reasonable cost. The purpose of this section, therefore, is to provide a
broad overview of biomedical engineering topics of interest to electrical engineers.
