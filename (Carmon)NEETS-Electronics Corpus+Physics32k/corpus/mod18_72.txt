As an example, if the antenna rotates at 20 rpm, it completes a revolution in 3 seconds. During this
time, a transmitter with a prf of 200 pulses per second (pps) transmits 600 pulses. Since 360 degrees of
azimuth must be covered, the following formula shows the number of pulses for each degree of azimuth:
