(cid:1) We began this chapter by analyzing the power and energy dissipated in first-
order resistor-capacitor networks driven by voltage-step inputs. The results
of this analysis were then used to determine the losses in NMOS logic gates.
Most importantly, we observed that, if the transients in NMOS logic gates
are allowed to settle, then the average power dissipated in the gates could
be decomposed into two parts: static losses and dynamic losses. Static
loss results when a pull-up resistor is connected across the power supply
by one or more closed MOSFETs. Dynamic loss results from the repeated
charging and discharging of the MOSFET gate-to-source capacitances, and
hence increases linearly with switching speed. We further observed that in
NMOS logic gates in which the switching transients settle, the static losses
are always much larger than the dynamic losses. Finally, this observation
motivated the development of CMOS logic gates, which do not exhibit
static losses. CMOS logic is therefore much more energy efficient that
NMOS logic.
