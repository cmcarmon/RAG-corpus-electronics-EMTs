For any integer of radix s, there exists an exact representation in radix r. This is not the case for a fraction
whose  conversion  is  a  geometrical  progression  that  never  converges.  Terminating  a  fraction  conversion  at n
digits (to the right of the radix point) results in an error or uncertainty. In decimal, this error is given by
