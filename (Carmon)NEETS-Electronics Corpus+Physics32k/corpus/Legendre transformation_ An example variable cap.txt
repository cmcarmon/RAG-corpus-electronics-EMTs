As another example from physics, consider a parallel-plate capacitor, in which the plates can move relative to one another. Such a capacitor would allow transfer of the electric energy which is stored in the capacitor into external mechanical work, done by the force acting on the plates. One may think of the electric charge as analogous to the "charge" of a gas in a cylinder, with the resulting mechanical force exerted on a piston.
Compute the force on the plates as a function of x, the distance which separates them. To find the force, compute the potential energy, and then apply the definition of force as the gradient of the potential energy function.
The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C(x) and charge Q is

{\displaystyle U(Q,\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{2}}QV={\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {Q^{2}}{C(\mathbf {x} )}},~}

where the dependence on the area of the plates, the dielectric constant of the material between the plates, and the separation x are abstracted away as the capacitance C(x). (For a parallel plate capacitor, this is proportional to the area of the plates and inversely proportional to the separation.)
The force F between the plates due to the electric field is then

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {x} )=-{\frac {dU}{d\mathbf {x} }}~.}

If the capacitor is not connected to any circuit, then the charges on the plates remain constant as they move, and the force is the negative gradient of the electrostatic energy

However, suppose, instead, that the voltage between the plates V is maintained constant by connection to a battery, which is a reservoir for charge at constant potential difference; now the charge is variable instead of the voltage, its Legendre conjugate. To find the force, first compute the non-standard Legendre transform,

The force now becomes the negative gradient of this Legendre transform, still pointing in the same direction,

The two conjugate energies happen to stand opposite to each other, only because of the linearity of the capacitance—except now Q is no longer a constant. They reflect the two different pathways of storing energy into the capacitor, resulting in, for instance, the same "pull" between a capacitor's plates.
