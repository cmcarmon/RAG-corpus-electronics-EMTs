Although “multimodal”  is  a  term  that  was  coined  by  policy  makers  to  facilitate  equitable  distribution  of
funding  among  transportation  modes  and  to  facilitate  interfaces  among  them,  it  applies  equally  well  to  the
supporting  technologies  of  the  original  modes. All  modes  now  utilize  microprocessor  controls  in  their  sub-
systems. With  microprocessor  control  has  come  additional  diagnostic  capability  and  the  use  of  system  level
intelligence, linking all intelligent subsystems and analog sensors and controls. Propulsion of vehicles now varies
by mode less than it used to. Because of microprocessors, propulsion can be controlled more precisely, allowing
vehicles to use non-traditional energy sources and to switch from one source to another easily, even automat-
ically.  We  do  not  yet  have  the  ideal  multimodal  vehicle,  capable  of  navigating,  either  automatically  or  by  a
driver/operator, through air, in water, on roads, and on rails, but technology is no longer a limiting factor. We
have not yet achieved the best balance among modes so that the most appropriate mode is utilized for passenger
or  freight  transportation,  but  the  tools  exist  to  make  those  decisions  possible.  (This  section  deals  primarily
with land transportation. See the index for aviation and maritime applications.)
