Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  the  operation  of  a  simple  bistable 
based on cross-coupled NOR gates. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  9  V  d.c.  power  supply  (or  a  9  V 
battery),  4001BE  quad  two-input  buffered  CMOS 
NOR  gate,  red  and  green  LEDs,    operational 
amplifier),  two  1  kT and  two  47  kT 5%  0.25  W 
resistors, test leads, connecting  wire.
