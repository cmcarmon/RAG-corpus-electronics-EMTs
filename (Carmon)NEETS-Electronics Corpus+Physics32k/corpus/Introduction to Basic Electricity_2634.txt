Capacitive reactance is a function of the frequency of 
the applied AC voltage and the capacitance.  Increasing 
the frequency decreases the reactance, resulting in 
greater current flow. Decreasing the frequency  increases 
the opposition and decreases current flow.
EXAMPLE:  What is the capacitive reactance of a 
1-microfarad capacitor at 60 hertz?
