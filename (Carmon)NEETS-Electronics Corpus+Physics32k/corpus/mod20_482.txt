RESISTANCEÂ—(1) The opposition a device or material offers to the flow of current. The effect of 
resistance is to raise the temperature of the material or device carrying the current. (2) A circuit element 
designed to offer a predetermined resistance to current flow. A resistance of 1 ohm will allow a current 
of 1 ampere to flow through it when a potential of 1 volt is applied. [1].
