CarTube uses a network of small bore tunnels to integrate existing motorways. A dynamic platoon system controls automated cars which circulate above and below ground, allowing them to move within milliseconds of one another. As all cars within the CarTube communicate with each other, far greater capacity could be provided, in comparison with conventional public transport, as cars can travel in a continuous flow at a steady speed without slowing down.
