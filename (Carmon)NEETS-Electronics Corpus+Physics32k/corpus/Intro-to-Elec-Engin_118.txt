Wheatstone Bridge
Null measurements are made with bridge circuits and related conﬁgurations. They differ from
direct measurements in that the quantity being measured is compared with a known reference
quantity. The balancing strategy avoids undesirable interaction effects and generally results in
more accurate measurement than the direct one.
