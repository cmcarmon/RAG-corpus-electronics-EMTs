Naval communications within the hf band can be grouped into four general types of services: point-
to-point, ship-to-shore, ground-to-air, and fleet broadcast. All but the fleet broadcast are normally 
operated with two-way communications. Some of these services involve ships and aircraft that present 
special problems because of their physical characteristics and mobility. Generally, the less than optimum 
hf performance of this shipboard equipment is at least partially offset by powerful transmitters and 
sensitive receiving systems at the shore terminals.
