X-ray Detection
Both  silicon  and  germanium  detectors  are  used  in  low  noise  systems  for  the  detection  of  ï¬‚uorescent  X-rays
produced  by  electron  beams  (usually  in  an  electron  microscope)  or  X-rays  (XRF).  For  both  materials,  the
detector  is  liquid-nitrogen  cooled  to  reduce  leakage  current,  and  small  volume  devices  (Fig. 116.9,  typically
