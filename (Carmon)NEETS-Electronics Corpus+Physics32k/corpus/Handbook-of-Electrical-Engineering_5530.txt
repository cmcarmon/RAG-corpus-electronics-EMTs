Fixed-Capacitor, Thyristor-Controlled Reactor (FC-TCR) Scheme
This scheme was originally developed for industrial applications, such as arc furnace “ﬂicker” control [Gyugyi
and  Taylor,  1980].  It  is  essentially  a  TCR  (controlled  by  a  delay  angle  a)  in  parallel  with  a  ﬁxed  capacitor.
Figure 61.27 shows a basic ﬁxed-capacitor, thyristor-controlled reactor-type compensator and associated wave-
forms. Figure 61.28 displays the steady-state reactive power versus terminal voltage characteristics of a static
VAR compensator. In the ﬁgure, BC is the imaginary part of the admittance of the capacitor C, and BL is the
imaginary part of the equivalent admittance of the reactor L at delay angle a. The relation between the output
VARs and the applied voltage is linear over the voltage band of regulation. In practice, the ﬁxed capacitor is
usually replaced by a ﬁlter network that has the required capacitive reactance at the power system frequency
but exhibits a low impedance at selected frequencies to absorb troublesome harmonics.
