Edward	Lawry	Norton,	as	he	implies	in	Norton’s	Theorem,	proposed	that	in	circuit
analysis,	any	linear	network,	granted	that	it	has	sources	of	voltage,	electric	current,
and	resistance,	has	an	equivalent	in	dual	network.	A	certain	system	may	be	unique,
but	values	that	can	make	a	similar	model	can	be	obtained.
To	find	a	circuit’s	equivalent	using	Norton’s	concepts,	certain	values	need	to	be
identified:	voltage,	electric	current,	and	resistance.	Once	there	are	clear	sources,
you	can	begin	formulating	the	necessary	equations.	However,	when	the	sources	are
