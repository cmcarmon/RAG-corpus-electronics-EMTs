Transmission System
Most VSAT systems employ BPSK or QPSK modulation with rate R = 1/2, K = 7 convolutional coding and
soft-decision Viterbi  decoding  on  both  the  inbound  and  outbound  channels.  Differential  phase  shift  keying
(DPSK) modulation may be used to reduce the demodulator complexity and cost. DPSK is relatively insensitive
