The Relascope is used by looking through the hole in the front of the instrument. When one looks through this hole they will see several scales that are used for different measurements on the bottom half of one's view, and on the top half one will see the tree that they are looking at. There are three scales for height of the tree used depending on the distance one is from the tree, five scales for diameter and two scales for basal area used depending on desired basal area factor.
