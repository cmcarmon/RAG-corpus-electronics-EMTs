As stated, the basic unit of power is the watt. Power in watts is equal to the voltage across a circuit
multiplied by current through the circuit. This represents the rate at any given instant at which work is
being done. The symbol P indicates electrical power. Thus, the basic power formula is P = E x I, where E
is voltage and I is current in the circuit. The amount of power changes when either voltage or current, or
both voltage and current, are caused to change.
