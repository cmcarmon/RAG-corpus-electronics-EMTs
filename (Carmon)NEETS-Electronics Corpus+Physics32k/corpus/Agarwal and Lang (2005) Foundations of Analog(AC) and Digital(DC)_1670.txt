e) Suppose that the inputs are arranged such that B = 1, C = 0, and D = 1, and
that a 0-V to 5-V square-wave signal is applied to the input A. Assume the square
wave cycle time is T, and that T is large enough so that the output comes close to
its steady state value for both falling and rising transitions. Under these conditions,
compute the power consumed by the CMOS and NMOS circuits when driving the
capacitance CL load.
