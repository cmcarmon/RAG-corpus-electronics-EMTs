Such complicated expressions typify circuit “simpliﬁcations.” A simple check for accuracy is the
units: Each component of the numerator should have the same units (here Ω3) as well as in the
denominator (Ω2). The entire expression is to have units of resistance; thus, the ratio of the
numerator’s and denominator’s units should be ohms. Checking units does not guarantee accuracy,
but can catch many errors.
