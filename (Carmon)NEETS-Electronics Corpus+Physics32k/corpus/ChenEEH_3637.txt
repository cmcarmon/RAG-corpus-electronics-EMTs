The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of some
salient methods and tools of modern speech processing with the
aim of familiarizing the reader with the key vocabulary and
main concepts and the most important models and algorithms.
In many instances, we will necessarily direct the reader to
literature sources for a deeper study of topics. Several current
and comprehensive textbooks on speech processing are avail-
able (Deller et al., 2000; Rabiner and Juang, 1993), and these
texts contain extensive references lists to original citations.1 The
most current developments in the Ô¨Åeld are often found in
conference proceedings, notably in Proceedings of the IEEE
International Conference on Acoustic, Speech, and Signal Process-
ing, Proceedings of the International Conference on Spoken Lan-
guage Processing, and Proceedings of Eurospeech. Many relevant
background topics are treated elsewhere in this book.
