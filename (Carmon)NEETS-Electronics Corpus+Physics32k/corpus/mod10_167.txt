Although both are forms of wave motion, sound requires a solid, liquid, or gaseous medium; whereas
light travels through empty space. The denser the medium, the greater the speed of sound. The opposite is
true of light. Light travels approximately one-third slower in water than in air. Sound travels through all
substances, but light cannot pass through opaque materials.
