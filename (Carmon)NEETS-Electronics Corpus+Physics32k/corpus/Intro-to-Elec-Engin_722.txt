A simple method of biasing the BJT is shown in Figure 8.1.1. While no general biasing procedure
that will work in all cases can be outlined, a reasonable approach is to assign 1/2 VCC as the drop
across the transistor, 3/8 VCC as the drop across RC to allow an adequate ac voltage swing capability
in the collector circuit, and 1/8 VCC as the drop across RE, so that RE is about 1/3 RC. With a speciﬁed
supply voltage VCC, biasing consists mainly of selecting values for VCEQ, ICQ, and IBQ = ICQ/β,
which deﬁne the operating Q point. One can then select
