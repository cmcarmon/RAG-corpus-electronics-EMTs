Several points regarding the zone selection and allocation
are important. First, the zones are selected to ensure that a
multiple usage of the breakers associated with each power
system component is achieved. Each circuit breaker may be
serving at least two protection functions. This enables sepa-
ration of the neighboring components in the case either one is
faulted. At the same time, the number of breakers used to
connect the components is minimized. By overlapping at
least two zones of protection around each circuit breaker, it
is important to make sure that there is no part of the power
system left unprotected. This includes the short connection
between circuit breakers or between circuit breakers and
busses. Such an overlap is only possible if instrument trans-
formers exist on both sides of the breaker, which is the case
with so-called dead-tank breakers that have current transform-
ers located in the breaker bushings.
