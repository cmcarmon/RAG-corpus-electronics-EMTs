Most radar oscillators operate at pulse voltages between 5 and 20 kilovolts. They require currents of
several amperes during the actual pulse which places severe requirements on the modulator. The function
of the high-vacuum tube modulator is to act as a switch to turn a pulse ON and OFF at the transmitter in
response to a control signal. The best device for this purpose is one which requires the least signal power
for control and allows the transfer of power from the transmitter power source to the oscillator with the
least loss. The pulse modulator circuits discussed in this section are typical pulse modulators used in radar
equipment.
