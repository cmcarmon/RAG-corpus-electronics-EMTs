Modal expansions are receiving increasing attention under the general name “fast multipole method,” which
is motivated by the goal of systematically exploiting the reduced complexity of the source-ﬁeld interactions as
their  separation  increases.  The  objective  is  to  reduce  the  signiﬁcant  interactions  of  a  Green’s-function  based
matrix from being proportional to (Nx)2 to of order Nx log (Nx), thus offering the possibility of decreasing the
operation count of iterative solutions.
