There are three types of control synchros: the CONTROL TRANSMITTER (CX), the CONTROL 
TRANSFORMER (CT), and the CONTROL DIFFERENTIAL TRANSMITTER (CDX). The control 
transmitter (CX) and the control differential transmitter (CDX) are identical to the TX and the TDX we 
discussed previously except for higher impedance windings in the CX and CDX. The higher impedance 
windings are necessary because control systems are based on having an internal voltage provide an output 
voltage to drive a large load. Torque systems, on the other hand, are based on having an internal current 
provide the driving torque needed to position an indicator. Since we discussed the theory and operation of 
the TX and the TDX earlier, we will not discuss their counterparts, the CX and CDX. However, we will 
cover the third control synchro, the CT, in depth during this discussion.
