The most popular type of radar is the pulsed radar. The
waveform of a pulsed radar is usually represented by the
pulse duration t, the pulse repetition interval (PRI) T, or
the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) fp. PRI is the time
interval between two adjacent pulses. PRF is the rate that
pulses repeat per second and is equal to the inverse of PRI.
The fraction of the total time that the transmitter is on is called
the duty cycle dc. For a Ô¨Åxed PRI, duty cycle is given by:
