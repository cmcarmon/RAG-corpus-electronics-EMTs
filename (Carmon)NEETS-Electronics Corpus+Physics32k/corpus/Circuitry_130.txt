(a)   L1 and  L2 are  in  series  and  they  can  be 
replaced by a single inductance (LA) of (60 + 
 
 
60) = 120 mH. 
(b)   LA appears  in  parallel  with  L2. These  two 
 
inductors  can  be  replaced  by  a  single 
inductor  (LB) of  (120  Ã—  120)/(120  +  120)  = 
 
 
60 mH. 
(c)   LB appears  in  series  with  L4. These  two 
 
inductors  can  be  replaced  by  a  single 
inductance (L) of (60 + 50) = 110 mH.
