Boiler explosions are of a particular danger in (locomotive-type) fire tube boilers because the top of the firebox (crown sheet) must be covered with some amount of water at all times; or the heat of the fire can weaken the crown sheet or crown stays to the point of failure, even at normal working pressure.
This was the cause of the Gettysburg Railroad firebox explosion near Gardners, Pennsylvania in 1995, where low water allowed the front of the crown sheet to overheat until the regular crown stays pulled through the sheet, releasing a great deal of steam and water under full boiler pressure into the firebox. Fortunately, the crown sheet design included several alternating rows of button-head safety stays, which limited the failure of the crown sheet to the first 5 or 6 rows of conventional stays, preventing a collapse of the entire crown sheet.
However, this type of failure is not limited to railway engines, as locomotive-type boilers have been used for traction engines, portable engines, skid engines used for mining or logging, stationary engines for sawmills and factories, for heating, and as package boilers providing steam for other processes. In all applications, maintaining the proper water level is essential for safe operation.
