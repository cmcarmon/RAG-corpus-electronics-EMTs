coefﬁcients and number of multiplier operations.5 For a pre-
scribed set of frequency speciﬁcations and a particular ﬁlter
structure, a certain order N0 may be capable of meeting the
speciﬁcations with inﬁnite precision. For ﬁlters with an order
lower than N0, it is not possible to meet the prescribed speciﬁ-
cations. Inﬁnite precision is translated as very high complexity
because an inﬁnite number of bits is required. If higher order is
used, the number of bits necessary for multiplier coefﬁcients
may be reduced, implying lower complexity. An order N1 in
Figure 2.26 is the order of the implementation with the lowest
possible complexity. Orders higher than N1 will necessarily
imply higher complexity. The heuristic introduced here,
when applied to the case of FIR ﬁlter designs using direct-
form realizations, leads to complexity curves that are very ﬂat
around their minimum point, indicating that almost min-
imum complexity can be achieved for a wide range of values
for the ﬁlter order. On the other hand, for IIR ﬁlters, the
complexity curve is rather sharp, implying that a more careful
choice for the ﬁlter order should be made.
