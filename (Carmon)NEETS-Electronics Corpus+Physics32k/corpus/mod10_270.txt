As a surface wave passes over the ground, the wave induces a voltage in the Earth. The induced 
voltage takes energy away from the surface wave, thereby weakening, or attenuating, the wave as it 
moves away from the transmitting antenna. To reduce the attenuation, the amount of induced voltage 
must be reduced. This is done by using vertically polarized waves that minimize the extent to which the 
electric field of the wave is in contact with the Earth. When a surface wave is horizontally polarized, the 
electric field of the wave is parallel with the surface of the Earth and, therefore, is constantly in contact 
with it. The wave is then completely attenuated within a short distance from the transmitting site. On the 
other hand, when the surface wave is vertically polarized, the electric field is vertical to the Earth and 
merely dips into and out of the Earth's surface. For this reason, vertical polarization is vastly superior to 
horizontal polarization for surface wave propagation.
