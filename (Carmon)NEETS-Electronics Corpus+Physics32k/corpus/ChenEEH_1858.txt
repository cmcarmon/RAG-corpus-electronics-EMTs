model, all signaling messages are routed through the gate-
keeper. In this case, use of RAS is necessary. This model allows
endpoints to access services provided by the gatekeeper, such

over their respective zones. This model is more suitable for IP
telephony service providers because they can control the net-
work and exercise accounting and billing functions.
