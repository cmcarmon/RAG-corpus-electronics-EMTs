This frequency is called the resonant frequency ωo of the system. In the context
of the homogeneous solution in the time domain developed in Chapter 12, this
was called the undamped resonant frequency. Notice also that this resonant
frequency is none other than the ωo obtained by writing the system function in
standard form as in Equation 14.25.
