Metal layers are used as wires for connections between the components. This is because metal has the lowest
propagation delay compared to the other layers. However, sometimes a poly layer is also used for short wires
in order to reduce the complexity of the wire routing. Any wire can cross another wire without getting electrically
affected as long as they are in different layers. Two different layers can be electrically connected together using
contacts.
  The  fabrication  process  of  the  contacts  depends  on  types  of  the  layers  that  are  to  be  connected.
Therefore, a layout editor supports different types of contacts by using different patterns.
