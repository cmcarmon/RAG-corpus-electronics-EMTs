ANTENNA COUPLER GROUP.â€”The antenna coupler group is an automatic antenna tuning 
system. However, the equipment design includes provisions for manual or semiautomatic tuning. This 
makes the system adaptable for use with other radio transmitters. The manual tuning capability is useful 
when a failure occurs in the automatic tuning circuitry. Tuning can also be accomplished without the use 
of rf power (SILENT TUNING). This method is useful in installations where radio silence must be 
maintained except for brief transmission periods.
