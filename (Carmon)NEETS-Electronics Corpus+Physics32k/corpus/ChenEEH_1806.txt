Besides QoS-based routing, there are two relevant concepts
called policy-based routing and constraint-based routing.
Policy-based routing (Avramovic, 1992) commonly means the
routing decision is not based on the knowledge of the network
topology and metrics but on some administrative policies. For
example, a policy may prohibit a trafﬁc ﬂow from using a
speciﬁc link for security reason even if the link satisﬁes all
the QoS constraints. Constraint-based routing (Kuipers et al.,
2002) is another new concept that is derived from QoS-based
routing but has a broader sense. In this routing, algorithm
routes are computed based on multiple constraints, including
both QoS constraints and policy constraints. Both QoS-based
routing and policy-based routing can be considered as special
cases of constraint-based routing.
