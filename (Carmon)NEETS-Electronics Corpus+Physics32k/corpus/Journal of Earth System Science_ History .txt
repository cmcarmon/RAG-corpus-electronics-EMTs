The Journal of Earth System Science was originally part of the Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences. This journal was established in 1934, but in 1978 it was split into three different journals: Journal of Earth System Science, Journal of Chemical Sciences and Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences - Mathematical Sciences, all of them continuing as "volume 87".
