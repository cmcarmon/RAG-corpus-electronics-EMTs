(b) Instead of an inﬁnite bus as in part (a), let the power to the motor be supplied by a
1000-kVA, 2300-V, wye-connected, three-phase, 60-Hz synchronous generator whose
synchronous reactance is also 5.00 /phase. The generator is driven at rated speed, and the
ﬁeld excitations of the generator and motor are adjusted so that the motor absorbs 750 kW
at unity power factor and rated terminal voltage. If the ﬁeld excitations of both machines
are then held constant, and the mechanical load on the synchronous motor is gradually
increased, compute the maximum motor torque under the conditions. Also determine the
armature current, terminal voltage, and power factor at the terminals corresponding to
this maximum load.
