This  is  implemented  with  the  circuit  in  Fig.  6.40(b)  with  the
battery giving the initial condition of 
V. We now combine the
two  circuits  in  Fig.  6.40(a)  and  (b)  to  obtain  the  complete  circuit
shown in Fig. 6.40(c). When the input signal 
is applied,
vo
we  open  the  switches  at 
,
which may be viewed on an oscilloscope.
