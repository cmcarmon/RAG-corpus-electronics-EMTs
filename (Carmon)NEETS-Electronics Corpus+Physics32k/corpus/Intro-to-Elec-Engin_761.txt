together, and capacitor CE is disconnected from
ground and used to couple a signal from a source
to the emitter. Determine Ri, Rin, Av1, and Ai.
8.4.1 For the CS JFET ampliﬁer circuit of Figure
8.4.1(a), RD = 2 k and RL = 3 k. The JFET
with ro = 15 k has a voltage gain Av1
= −4.5
when the entire source resistance is bypassed. Find
gm.
