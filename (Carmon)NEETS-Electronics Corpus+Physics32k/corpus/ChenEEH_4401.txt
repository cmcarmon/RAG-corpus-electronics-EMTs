The columns of U (v) can be called the principal input
directions, and the columns of Y (v) are the principal out-
put directions. If the input is parallel to a principal input
direction, then the steady-state response will be along the
corresponding principal output direction scaled by the corres-
ponding singular value. In this sense, the singular values quan-
tify the size of the effect of a transfer function matrix on
particular input directions.
