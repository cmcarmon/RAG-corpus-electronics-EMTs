Let one of the emitters, say A, be grounded and therefore let VA be low while VB and VC are high.
∼= (VCC − 0.7)/R1 will be ﬂowing in
The situation is then as shown in Figure E9.2.2. There is a current path from VCC down through R1
and emitter A to ground. With vX = 0.7 V a base current iB1
transistor T1. Note, however, that iC1 must be ﬂowing out of the base of transistor T2. That being
the wrong direction for the base current of an npn transistor, it must represent the reverse current
through one of the junctions in T2. Reverse currents being very small, iB1 >> iC1 /β. Hence T1
will be saturated, and its collector-to-emitter A voltage will be V CE sat, which is about 0.2 V. Thus,
the voltage at Y will be about 0.2 V, which is much less than the 1.4 V needed to forward-bias the
emitter junctions of T2 and T3. Thus T3 is cut off and output Vo at F is high.
