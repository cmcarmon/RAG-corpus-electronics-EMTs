Numerical models indicate that noise in thin-ﬁlm media increases when the grains in polycrystalline ﬁlms
are strongly exchange coupled [Zhu and Bertram, 1988]. Exchange coupled ﬁlms tend to exhibit zigzag tran-
sitions, which produce considerable jitter in the transition position relative to the location where the record
current in the head goes through zero. A variety of experimental studies have indicated that the introduction
of nonmagnetic elements which segregate to the grain boundaries and careful control of the sputtering condi-
tions  to  achieve  a  porous  microstructure  at  the  grain  boundaries  reduce  such  transition  jitter  [Chen  and
Yamashita, 1988].
