According to theory, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of the atoms are thought to be arranged in a
manner similar to a miniature solar system. Notice the helium atom in figure 1-2. Two protons and two
neutrons form the heavy nucleus with a positive charge around which two very light electrons revolve.
The path each electron takes around the nucleus is called an orbit. The electrons are continuously being
acted upon in their orbits by the force of attraction of the nucleus. To maintain an orbit around the
nucleus, the electrons travel at a speed that produces a counterforce equal to the attraction force of the
nucleus. Just as energy is required to move a space vehicle away from the earth, energy is also required to
move an electron away from the nucleus. Like a space vehicle, the electron is said to be at a higher energy
level when it travels a larger orbit. Scientific experiments have shown that the electron requires a certain
amount of energy to stay in orbit. This quantity is called the electron’s energy level. By virtue of just its
motion alone, the electron contains kinetic energy. Because of its position, it also contains potential
energy. The total energy contained by an electron (kinetic energy plus potential energy) is the main factor
that determines the radius of the electron’s orbit. For an electron to remain in this orbit, it must neither
gain nor lose energy.
