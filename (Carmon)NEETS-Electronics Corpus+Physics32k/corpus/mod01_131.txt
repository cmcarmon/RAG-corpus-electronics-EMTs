A popular theory of magnetism considers the molecular alignment of the material. This is known as
Weber’s theory. This theory assumes that all magnetic substances are composed of tiny molecular
magnets. Any unmagnetized material has the magnetic forces of its molecular magnets neutralized by
adjacent molecular magnets, thereby eliminating any magnetic effect. A magnetized material will have
most of its molecular magnets lined up so that the north pole of each molecule points in one direction, and
the south pole faces the opposite direction. A material with its molecules thus aligned will then have one
effective north pole, and one effective south pole. An illustration of Weber’s Theory is shown in figure 1-
11, where a steel bar is magnetized by stroking. When a steel bar is stroked several times in the same
direction by a magnet, the magnetic force from the north pole of the magnet causes the molecules to align
themselves.
