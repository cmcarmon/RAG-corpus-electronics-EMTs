The bolometer is a loading device that undergoes changes of resistance as changes in dissipated
power occur. The two types of bolometers are the BARRETTER and the THERMISTOR. The barretter is
characterized by an increase in resistance as the dissipated power rises. The thermistor decreases in
resistance as the power increases. In either case, resistance is measured before and after the application of
rf power. If the same change in resistance is then produced by a variable dc source of power, then the rf
power is equal to the measured dc power. This relationship makes possible the direct calibration of a
bridge circuit in units of power. In other words, one condition of balance exists when no rf power is
applied; but in the presence of power, a second condition of balance exists because of the resistance
changes of the bolometer. It is this change of resistance that is calibrated in power.
