In this case the three-acceleration vector is perpendicular to the three-velocity vector,







u

{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}\cdot {\vec {a}}=0.}

and the square of proper acceleration, expressed as a scalar invariant, the same in all reference frames,

{\displaystyle \alpha ^{2}=\gamma ^{4}a^{2}+\gamma ^{6}({\vec {u}}\cdot {\vec {a}})^{2},}

becomes the expression for circular motion,

{\displaystyle \alpha ^{2}=\gamma ^{4}a^{2}.}

or, taking the positive square root and using the three-acceleration, we arrive at the proper acceleration for circular motion:

{\displaystyle \alpha =\gamma ^{2}{\frac {v^{2}}{r}}.}
