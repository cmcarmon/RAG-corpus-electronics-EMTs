At T1, the voltage across the capacitor (the voltage on the emitter) has reached approximately 12.8 
volts. This is the peak point for the unijunction, and it now becomes forward biased. With the emitter 
forward biased, the impedance between the emitter and B1 is just a few ohms. This is similar to placing a 
short across the capacitor. The capacitor discharges very rapidly through the low resistance of B1 to E.
