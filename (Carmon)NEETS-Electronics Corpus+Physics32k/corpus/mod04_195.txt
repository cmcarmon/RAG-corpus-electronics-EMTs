A narrow, flat tape should be used wherever possible for lacing and tying. This tape is not an 
adhesive type of tape. Round cord may also be used, but its use is not preferred because cord has a 
tendency to cut into wire insulation. Use cotton, linen, nylon, or glass fiber cord or tape, according to the 
temperature requirements. Cotton or linen cord or tape must be prewaxed to make it moisture and fungus 
resistant. Nylon cord or tape may be waxed or unwaxed; glass fiber cord or tape is usually not waxed.
