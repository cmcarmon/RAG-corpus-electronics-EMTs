One ingenious way to reduce the impact that a current-measuring device has on a circuit
is to use the circuit wire as part of the ammeter movement itself. All current-carrying wires
produce a magnetic ﬁeld, the strength of which is in direct proportion to the strength of the
current. By building an instrument that measures the strength of that magnetic ﬁeld, a no-
contact ammeter can be produced. Such a meter is able to measure the current through a
conductor without even having to make physical contact with the circuit, much less break
continuity or insert additional resistance.
