Harassment is continually annoying an individual 
by creating an unpleasant or hostile environment 
through verbal or physical conduct. Any behavior that 
is unwelcomed or discriminatory is considered harass-
ment and can have a negative impact on performance 
and productivity in the workplace. Harassment can 
also affect an employeeâ€™s advancement opportunities 
or pay status.
