There are three main reasons for price points to appear:
Substitution price points
price points occur at the price of a close substitute
when an item's price rises above the cost of a close substitute, the quantity demanded drops sharply

Customary price points
the market grows accustomed to paying a certain amount for a type of product
increasing the price beyond this amount will cause sales to drop dramatically

Perceptual price points (also referred to as "psychological pricing" or as "odd-number pricing")
raising a price above 99 cents will cause demand to fall disproportionately because people perceive $1.00 as a significantly higher price
