Consider the arbitrarily shaped sample shown in Fig. 22.36(a). Here, a current I ﬂows between contacts 1
and 2, and a voltage Vc is measured between contacts 3 and 4. Let Rij,kl ≡ Vkl/Iij, where the current enters contact i
and  leaves  contact  j,  and Vkl = Vk  – Vl.  (These  deﬁnitions,  as  well  as  the  contact  numbering,  correspond  to
ASTM Standard F76.) The resistivity, ρ, with B = 0, is then calculated as follows:
