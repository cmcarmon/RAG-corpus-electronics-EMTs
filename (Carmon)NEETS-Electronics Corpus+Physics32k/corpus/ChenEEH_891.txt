of the short and long path delays ( ^DDi, j
PM ) for every
local data path Ri?Rj. Second, provided the path delay infor-
mation is predictable, correct circuit operation is contingent
upon the accurate implementation of the computed clock
schedule tcd. Both of these factors must be considered if reliable
circuit operation under various operating conditions is to be
attained.
