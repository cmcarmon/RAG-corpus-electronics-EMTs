In the case of longitudinal harmonic sound waves, the frequency and wavelength can be described by the formula

{\displaystyle y(x,t)=y_{0}\cos {\Bigg (}\omega \left(t-{\frac {x}{c}}\right){\Bigg )}}

where:
y is the displacement of the point on the traveling sound wave;
x is the distance the point has traveled from the wave's source;
t is the time elapsed;
y0 is the amplitude of the oscillations,
c is the speed of the wave; and
ω is the angular frequency of the wave.
The quantity x/c is the time that the wave takes to travel the distance x.
The ordinary frequency (f) of the wave is given by

{\displaystyle f={\frac {\omega }{2\pi }}.}

The wavelength can be calculated as the relation between a wave's speed and ordinary frequency.

{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {c}{f}}.}

For sound waves, the amplitude of the wave is the difference between the pressure of the undisturbed air and the maximum pressure caused by the wave.
Sound's propagation speed depends on the type, temperature, and composition of the medium through which it propagates.
