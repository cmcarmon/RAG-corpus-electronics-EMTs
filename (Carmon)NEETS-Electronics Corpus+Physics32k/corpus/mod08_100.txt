The inductors that make up the primary and secondary of the transformer have very little dc 
resistance, so the efficiency of the amplifiers is very high. Transformer coupling is very often used for the 
final output (between the final amplifier stage and the output device) because of the impedance-matching 
qualities of the transformer. The frequency response of transformer-coupled amplifiers is limited by the 
inductive reactance of the transformer just as it was limited in impedance coupling.
