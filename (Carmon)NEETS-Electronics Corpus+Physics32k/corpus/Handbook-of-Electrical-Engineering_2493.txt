As VGS ﬁ 0, rds ﬁ rds(on), and as VGS ﬁ VP ,rds ﬁ ¥. This latter condition corresponds to the channel being
pinched off in its entirety all the way from source to drain. This is like having a big block of insulator (i.e., the
depletion  region)  between  source  and  drain.  When  VGS  =  0,  rds  is  reduced  to  its  minimum  value  of  rds(on),
