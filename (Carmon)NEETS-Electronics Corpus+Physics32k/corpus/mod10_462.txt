Figure 3-17, view A, illustrates how the characteristic impedance of an infinite line can be
calculated. Resistors are added in series parallel across terminals K and L in eight steps, and the resultant
impedances are noted. In step 1 the impedance is infinite; in step 2 the impedance is 110 ohms. In step 3
the impedance becomes 62.1 ohms, a change of 47.9 ohms. In step 4 the impedance is 48.5 ohms, a
change of only 13.6 ohms. The resultant changes in impedance from each additional increment become
progressively smaller. Eventually, practically no change in impedance results from further additions to the
line. The total impedance of the line at this point is said to be at its characteristic impedance; which, in
this case, is 37 ohms. This means that an infinite line constructed as indicated in step 8 could be
effectively replaced by a 37-ohm resistor. View B shows a 37-ohm resistor placed in the line at various
points to replace the infinite line of step 8 in view A. There is no change in total impedance.
