In reflection seismology, a polarity reversal or phase change is a local amplitude seismic attribute anomaly that can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons and is therefore known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. It primarily results from the change in polarity of the seismic response when a shale (with a lower acoustic impedance) overlies a brine-saturated zone (with a high acoustic impedance), that becomes invaded with an oil/gas sand (with the lowest acoustic impedance of the three). This changes the acoustic impedance contrast from an increase to a decrease, resulting in the polarity of the seismic response being reversed - as per the normal convention adopted by the SEG.
