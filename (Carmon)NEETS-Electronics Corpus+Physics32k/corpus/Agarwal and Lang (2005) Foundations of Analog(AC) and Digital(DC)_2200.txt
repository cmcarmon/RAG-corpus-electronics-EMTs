Find the Th√©venin output resistance of the circuit shown in
Figure 15.62. That is, find the resistance seen looking in at the terminals X X, the
terminals that drive the load resistance RL. (Resistor RL should not be included when you
make this calculation.) Do not assume v
, as it leads to trouble here. Now, state a
condition on the value of RS to ensure that the circuit acts as a current source driving RL.
