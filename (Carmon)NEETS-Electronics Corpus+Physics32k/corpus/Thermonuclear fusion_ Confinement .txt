The key problem in achieving thermonuclear fusion is how to confine the hot plasma. Due to the high temperature, the plasma can not be in direct contact with any solid material, so in fact it has to be located in a vacuum. Also, high temperatures imply high pressures. Moreover, the plasma tends to expand immediately and some force is necessary to act against it. This force can be either gravitation in stars, magnetic forces in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, or the fusion reaction may occur before the plasma starts to expand, so in fact the plasma's inertia is keeping the material together.
