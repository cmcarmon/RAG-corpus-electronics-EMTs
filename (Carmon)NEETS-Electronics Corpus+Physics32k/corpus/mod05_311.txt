It works this way once itâ€™s started. However, one of the disadvantages of a synchronous motor is that
it cannot be started from a standstill by applying three-phase ac power to the stator. When ac is applied to
the stator, a high-speed rotating magnetic field appears immediately. This rotating field rushes past the
rotor poles so quickly that the rotor does not have a chance to get started. In effect, the rotor is repelled
first in one direction and then the other. A synchronous motor in its purest form has no starting torque. It
has torque only when it is running at synchronous speed.
