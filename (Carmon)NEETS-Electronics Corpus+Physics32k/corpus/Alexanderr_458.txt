linear  function.  The  attributes  of  V1  are  set  as 
T2 ⫽ 0.001,
and so on. To be able to plot both
input  and  output  voltages,  we  insert  two  voltage  markers  as  shown.  We
select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient Analysis dialog
box  and  set  Final  Time as  6  s.  Once  the  schematic  is  saved,  we  select
Analysis/Simulate to run and obtain the plots shown in Fig. 8.55(b).
