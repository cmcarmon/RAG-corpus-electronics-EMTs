Deflection sensitivity for a given CRT might typically be 0.2 millimeters per volt. This means the
spot on the screen will be deflected 0.2 millimeters (about 0.008 inch) when a difference of 1 volt exists
between the plates. Sometimes the reciprocal of deflection sensitivity (called DEFLECTION FACTOR)
is given. The deflection factor for the example given would be 125 volts per inch (1/0.008).
