Prior to October 1940 the Royal Air Force instructed bomber crews to bring unexpended bombs home. From 9 October 1940, they were instructed to attack any target of opportunity if they could not locate their assigned targets.
The United States Department of Defense and NATO defined a nuclear target of opportunity as "a nuclear target detected observed or detected after an operation begins that has previously not been considered, analyzed or planned for a nuclear strike. Generally fleeting in nature, it should be attacked as soon as possible within the time limitations imposed for coordination and warning of friendly troops and aircraft."
