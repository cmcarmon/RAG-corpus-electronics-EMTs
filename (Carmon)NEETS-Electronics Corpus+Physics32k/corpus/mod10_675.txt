A parasitic element is sometimes placed so it will produce maximum radiation (during transmission) 
from its associated driver. When it operates to reinforce energy coming from the driver toward itself, the 
parasitic element is referred to as a DIRECTOR. If a parasitic element is placed so it causes maximum 
energy radiation in a direction away from itself and toward the driven element, that parasitic element is 
called a REFLECTOR.
