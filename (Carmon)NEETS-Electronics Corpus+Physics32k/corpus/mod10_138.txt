Light radiates from its source in all directions until absorbed or diverted by some substance (fig.
1-17). The lines drawn from the light source (a light bulb in this instance) to any point on one of these
waves indicate the direction in which the waves are moving. These lines, called radii of the spheres, are
formed by the waves and are called LIGHT RAYS.
