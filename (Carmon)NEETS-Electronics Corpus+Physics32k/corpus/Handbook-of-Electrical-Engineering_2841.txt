It may be desirable to segment the board into areas based on function: RF, low power, high power, etc. using
all SMDs where appropriate, and mixed-technology components as needed. Power and connector portions of
the  circuit  may  point  to  the  use  of  through-hole  components,  although  as  mentioned  both  these  issues  are
being addressed by circuit board material and connector manufacturers. Using one solder technique (reﬂow
or wave) simpliﬁes processing, and may outweigh other considerations.
