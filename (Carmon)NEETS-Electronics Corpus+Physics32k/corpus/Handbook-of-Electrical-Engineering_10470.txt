A virtual reality calibration technique was developed for reliable and accurate matching of a graphically
simulated  environment  in  3D  geometry  with  actual  video  camera  views.  The  system  was  designed  for
predictive  displays  with  calibrated  graphics  that  overlay  in  live  video  for  telerobotics  applications.  For
example, the system allows an operator to designate precise movements of a robot arm before sending the
command to execute.
