From the expression of y(t), one sees that the term xw
The effects of the damping coefÔ¨Åcient on the transient response are seen in Fig. 100.7.
The effects of the natural frequency of oscillation w
n increases, the frequency of oscillation increases.
For the case when 0 < x < 1, the underdamped case, one can analyze the critical transient response parameters.
