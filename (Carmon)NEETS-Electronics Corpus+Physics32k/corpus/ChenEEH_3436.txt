current distribution is such that the fault currents are the
highest for the faults closest to the source and the current
decays as the fault gets farther away from the source. This
property allows the use of the fault current magnitudes as the
main criterion for the relaying action. The overcurrent relaying
principle is combined with the inverse-time operating charac-
teristic, as shown in Figure 9.11, and this represents the
relaying solution for radial distribution feeders in most cases.
The inverse-time property designates the relationship between
the current magnitude and the relay operating time (the higher
the fault current magnitude, the shorter the relay operation
time). Further discussion is related to the setting procedures
for the overcurrent relays with inverse-time characteristics.
