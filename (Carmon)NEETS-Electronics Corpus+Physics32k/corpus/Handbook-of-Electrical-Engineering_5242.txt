The larger generators are unit-connected. In this arrangement the generator is directly connected, without
a circuit breaker, to the main transformer. A conceptual one-line diagram is shown in Fig. 59.7. The generator
supplies main and auxiliary transformers without circuit breakers. The units are connected in parallel at the
high-voltage side of the main transformers by a busbar. The transmission lines are also supplied from this bus.
Circuit breakers are installed at the secondary side of the main and auxiliary transformer. The application of
generator  circuit  breaker  is  not  economical  in  the  case  of  large  generators.  Because  of  the  generatorâ€™s  large
short-circuit  current,  special  expensive  circuit  breakers  are  required.  However,  the  transformers  reduce  the
short-circuit  current  and  permit  the  use  of  standard  circuit  breakers  at  the  secondary  side.  The  disconnect
switches permit visual observation of the off state and are needed for maintenance of the circuit breakers.
