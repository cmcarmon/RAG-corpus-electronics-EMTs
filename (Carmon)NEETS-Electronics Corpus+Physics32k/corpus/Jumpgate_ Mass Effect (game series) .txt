In the Mass Effect series of games, a system of mass relays that link planetary systems were created by a civilization that vanished thousands of years ago. The relays use the mass effect of element zero (related to dark energy) to create a virtually mass-free "corridor" of space-time between each other, allowing virtually instantaneous travel between any two points. They come in two versions, one version links to all nearby relays while the other links to only one relay but has greater range. Ships also have FTL-cores that use the same principle, but don't have the energy capacity of a relay. The bigger the ship, the more mass must be neutralized and the slower it can travel per unit of element zero.
