A group of auxiliary controls covered by a hinged panel is used for special tests and for calibration
of the tester. Two of these controls, labeled SIGNAL CAL (R152 and R155, fig. 2-2), are used with
special test cards for adjusting the regulation and amplitude of the signal voltage. A pushbutton labeled
CATH ACT (S302D) is used for making cathode activity tests. When this button is pressed, DS106 on the
front panel (fig. 2-1) lights, and the filament voltage of the tube under test is reduced by 10%. Results of
the test are read as a change in reading on the numerical meter scale.
