is the tendency of a power tool to rotate around its axis. 
Before using a power tool, determine how the torque 
influences the device as it is moved around, before ap-
plying it to the task it was designed to do. Make sure 
to apply a good grip on the tool and balance yourself 
before using it as intended. When you are finished with 
the tool, disconnect it and store it properly.
