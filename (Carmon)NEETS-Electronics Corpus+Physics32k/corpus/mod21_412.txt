When the unknown signal is relatively weak, such as the signal from a klystron oscillator, the 
wavemeter is usually used as an absorption type of device. Connection is made to the instrument at input  
D. Rf loop C then acts as an injection loop to the cavity. When the cavity is tuned to the resonant 
frequency of the klystron, maximum energy is absorbed by the cavity, and the current indicated on the 
meter dips. When the cavity is not tuned to the frequency of the klystron, high current is indicated on the 
current meter. Therefore, the cavity is tuned for a minimum reading, or dip, in the meter; and the resonant 
frequency is determined from the micrometer setting and the calibration chart.
