In this study, a run consists of a maximum of 100 consecu-
tive trials. It is considered successful if the last trial (trial
number less than 100) of the run has lasted 800 time-steps
(with a step size of 0.05 sec). Otherwise, if the NDP controller
is unable to swing up and keep the pendulum balanced at the
top within 100 trials (i.e., none of the 100 trails has lasted over
800 time-steps), then the run is considered unsuccessful. In
this discussionâ€™s simulations, a trial is either terminated at the
end of the 800 times-steps or when the angular velocity of the
pendulum is greater than 2p (i.e., v > 2p).
