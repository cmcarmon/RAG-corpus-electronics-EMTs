requests into messages, and transmits them via a communications interface (such as the Computer Interconnect
port  driver)  to  the  Disk  Class  Server  resident  within  a  controller  in  the  I/O  subsystem.  The  command  set
supported  by  the  Class  Server  includes  such  relatively  device-independent  operations  as  read  logical  block,
write logical block, bring on-line, and request status. The Disk Class Server1 interprets the transmitted com-
mands,  handles  the  scheduling  of  command  execution,  tracks  their  progress,  and  reports  status  back  to  the
Class Driver. Note the absence of seek or select head commands. This interface can be used equally well for
solid-state disks as for conventional magnetic disks. Device-speciÔ¨Åc commands are issued at a lower level of
the architecture, i.e., between the Device Client (disk controller) and Device Server (disk device). The former
provides the path for moving commands and data between hosts and drives, and it is usually realized physically
by a piece of hardware that corresponds to the device controller. The latter coincides with the physical drives
used for storing and retrieving data.
