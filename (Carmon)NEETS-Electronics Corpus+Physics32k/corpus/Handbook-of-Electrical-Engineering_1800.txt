Block Matching
Block  matching  methods  estimate  the  displacement  within  an
M 3 N block in an image frame. The estimate is determined by
ﬁnding the best match between the M 3 N block in a frame at
time t and its best match from frame at t –  TS . An underlying
assumption in the block matching techniques is that each pixel
within  a  block  has  the  same  displacement.  A  general  block
matching algorithm is given as follows:
