In a step-index fiber, the refractive index of the core is uniform and undergoes an abrupt change at
the core-cladding boundary. Step-index fibers obtain their name from this abrupt change called the step
change in refractive index. In graded-index fibers, the refractive index of the core varies gradually as a
function of radial distance from the fiber center.
