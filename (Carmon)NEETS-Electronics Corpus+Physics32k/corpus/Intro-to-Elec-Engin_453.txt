Analog Computers
Although not used as much as the digital computer (which nowadays forms the basic tool for
numerical analysis and the solution of algebraic as well as differential equations), the analog
computer still retains some signiÔ¨Åcant advantages over the digital computer. A physical system
can be represented by a set of differential equations which can be modeled on an analog computer
that uses continuously varying voltages to represent system variables. The differential equation
is solved by the computer, whereas the modeled quantities are readily varied by adjusting passive
components on the computer. The mathematical functions (integration, addition, scaling, and
inversion) are provided by op amps.
