The switched networks discussed in this section, automatic voice network, automatic secure voice 
communications, automatic digital network, and the defense special security communications system, are 
part of the DCS and are managed by the Defense Communications Agency (DCA). You should not 
confuse these DCS networks with the HICOM (high-command communications network) and NORATS 
(Navy operational radio and telephone switchboard) networks. We will discuss both of these Navy-only 
networks later in this chapter.
