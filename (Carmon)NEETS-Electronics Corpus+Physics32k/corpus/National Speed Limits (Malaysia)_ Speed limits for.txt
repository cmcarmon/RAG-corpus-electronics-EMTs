Special speed limits are applied to heavy vehicles, and all heavy vehicles have speed limit stickers describing the allowed speed limits. However, many heavy vehicles especially express buses do not obey these speed limits.
The speed limits for heavy vehicles are as follows:-
Expressways: 80–90 km/h (50-56 mph)
Federal and state roads: 70–80 km/h (43-50 mph) by default, 60 km/h (37 mph) in urban areas
