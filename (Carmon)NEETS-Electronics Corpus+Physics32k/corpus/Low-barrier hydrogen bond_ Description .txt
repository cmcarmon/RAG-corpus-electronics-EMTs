Standard hydrogen bonds are longer (e.g. 2.8 Å for an O···O h-bond), and the hydrogen ion clearly belongs to one of the heteroatoms. When pKa of the heteroatoms is closely matched, a LBHB becomes possible at a shorter distance (~2.55 Å). When the distance further decreases (< 2.29 Å) the bond is characterized as a single-well or short-strong hydrogen bond.
