Consequently, the gain provided by our circuit is entirely determined by our choice of the feedback resistor
RF and the input resistor R.
It is always negative, and can be less than one or greater than one in
magnitude. It cannot exceed the op-amp’s inherent gain and should not produce such large outputs that
distortion results (remember the power supply!). Interestingly, note that this relationship does not depend
on the load resistance. This eﬀect occurs because we use load resistances large compared to the op-amp’s
output resistance. Thus observation means that, if careful, we can place op-amp circuits in cascade, without
incurring the eﬀect of succeeding circuits changing the behavior (transfer function) of previous ones; see this
problem (Problem 3.43).

As long as design requirements are met, the input-output relation for the inverting ampliﬁer also applies
when the feedback and input circuit elements are impedances (resistors, capacitors, and inductors).
