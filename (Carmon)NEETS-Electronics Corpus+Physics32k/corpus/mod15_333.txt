The above quantities are related to vectors so that the relative directions may be easily compared. 
The SPIN VECTOR lies along the spin axis of the rotor with an arrow indicating the direction of rotation. 
The TORQUE VECTOR represents the axis about which the applied force is felt. The PRECESSION 
VECTOR represents the axis about which precession occurs. In all the above cases the direction of the 
vector is such that the quantity (spin, torque, or precession) is in a clockwise direction if viewed from the 
tail of the vector.
