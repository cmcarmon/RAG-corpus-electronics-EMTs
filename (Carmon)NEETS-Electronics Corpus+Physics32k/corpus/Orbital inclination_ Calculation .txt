In astrodynamics, the inclination i can be computed from the orbital momentum vector h (or any vector perpendicular to the orbital plane) as




i
=
arccos

{\displaystyle i=\arccos {h_{z} \over \left|\mathbf {h} \right|}}
,
where hz is the z-component of h.
Mutual inclination of two orbits may be calculated from their inclinations to another plane using cosine rule for angles.
