Discrete Arrays for Beamforming
An array of sensors could be distributed at distinct points in space in various ways. Line arrays, planar arrays,
and volumetric arrays could be either uniformly spaced or nonuniformly spaced, including the possibility of
placing  sensors  randomly  according  to  some  probability  distribution  function.  Uniform  spacing  along  each
coordinate axis permits one to exploit the well-developed multidimensional signal processing techniques con-
cerned with ﬁlter design, DFT computation via FFT, and high-resolution spectral analysis of sampled signals
[Dudgeon, 1977]. Nonuniform spacing sometimes might be useful for reducing the number of sensors, which
otherwise  might  be  constrained  to  satisfy  a  maximum  spacing  between  uniformly  placed  sensors  to  avoid
grating lobes due to aliasing, as explained later. A discrete array, uniformly spaced, is convenient for the synthesis
of a digital ﬁlter or beamformer by the performing of digital signal processing operations (namely delay, sum,
and  multiplication  or  weighting)  on  the  signal  received  by  a  collection  of  sensors  distributed  in  space.  The
sequence of the nature of operations dictates the types of beamformer. Common beamforming systems are of
