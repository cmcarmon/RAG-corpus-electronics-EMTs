Therefore, the work done by a force F on an object that travels along a curve C is given by the line integral:

{\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {x} =\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt,}

where dx(t) defines the trajectory C and v is the velocity along this trajectory. In general this integral requires the path along which the velocity is defined, so the evaluation of work is said to be path dependent.
The time derivative of the integral for work yields the instantaneous power,
