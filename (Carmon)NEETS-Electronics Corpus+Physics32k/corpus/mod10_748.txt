A LONG-WIRE ANTENNA is an antenna that is a wavelength or longer at the operating frequency. 
In general, the gain achieved with long-wire antennas is not as great as the gain obtained from the 
multielement arrays studied in the previous section. But the long-wire antenna has advantages of its own. 
The construction of long-wire antennas is simple, both electrically and mechanically, with no particularly 
critical dimensions or adjustments. The long-wire antenna will work well and give satisfactory gain and 
directivity over a frequency range up to twice the value for which it was cut. In addition, it will accept 
power and radiate it efficiently on any frequency for which its overall length is not less than 
approximately 1/2 wavelength. Another factor is that long-wire antennas have directional patterns that are 
sharp in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Also, they tend to concentrate the radiation at the low 
vertical angles. Another type of long-wire antenna is the BEVERAGE ANTENNA, also called a WAVE 
ANTENNA. It is a horizontal, long-wire antenna designed especially for the reception and transmission 
of low-frequency, vertically polarized ground waves. It consists of a single wire, two or more 
wavelengths long, supported 3 to 6 meters above the ground, and terminated in its characteristic 
impedance, as shown in figure 4-34.
