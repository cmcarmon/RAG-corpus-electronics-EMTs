In chemistry it is known that increased temperature increases the rate or reaction of an experiment, however vibrational bonds are not formed like covalent bonds where electrons are shared between the two bonding atoms. Vibrational bonds are created at high energy where the muonium bounces to and from bromine atoms "like a ping pong ball bouncing between two bowling balls," according to Donald Fleming. This bouncing action lowers the potential energy of the BrMuBr molecule, and therefore slows the rate of the reaction.
This type of bond has been confirmed in the BrMuBr molecules but in the heavier isotopes of hydrogen (protium, deuterium, and tritium), the vibrational bonding can only occur as the van der Waals forces are overcome and the vibrational bond is formed.
