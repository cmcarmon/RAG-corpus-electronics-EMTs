Direct  Thermal  Printing.  The  key  aspects  to  this  technology
are the thin-ﬁlm resistive serial printhead and the special paper
required.  A  typical  array  structure  (see  Fig. 89.31)  consists  of
photolithographically  deﬁned  and  deposited  heater  material
(e.g., Ta2N or TaAl) on a contoured insulating substrate. One or
more protective layers (e.g., SiO2, Ta2O5 or SiC) are deposited on
top of the heater layer for abrasion resistance and electrical insu-
lation.  Contours  (raised  areas  or  bumps)  on  the  surface  under
the heater areas are constructed by a raised glass “glaze” of about
40 mm and provide both improved contact with the paper and
short  time  constant  thermal  insulation  to  the  substrate.  This
structure  is  often  called  the  thin-ﬁlm  head  structure. Alternates
include (1) the silicon mesa technology, where a two-dimensional
array of silicon mesas is fabricated from monolithic silicon, and
(2) the thick-ﬁlm technology. With the former, each mesa contains
its own resistor-transistor/diode on the base of the silicon chip.
Joule heating occurs when voltage is applied to the resistor via
the  transistor/diode.  With  the  thick-ﬁlm  approach,  a  resistor
