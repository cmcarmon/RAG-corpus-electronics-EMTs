POTENTIOMETERâ€”An electromechanical device, used as a position sensor in servo systems,
having a terminal connected to each end of a restrictive element, and a third connected to a
wiper contact. The output is a voltage that is variable depending upon the position of the
wiper contact. The potentiometer is commonly referred to as a variable voltage divider. It, in
effect, converts mechanical information into an electrical signal.
