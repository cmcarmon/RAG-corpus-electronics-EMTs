Another precision rectiﬁer circuit is shown in Fig. 5.18. In this circuit, the load voltage is an ampliﬁed and
inverted version of the negative variations in the input signal, and is 0 when the input is positive. Also in contrast
with the previous circuit, the ampliﬁer in this rectiﬁer is not driven to one of its output extremes. When vin is
negative, the ampliﬁer output, vo, is positive, so diode D1 is reverse biased and diode D2 is forward biased. D1
is  open  and  D2  connects  the  ampliﬁer  output  through  Rf  to  v –.  Thus,  the  circuit  behaves  like  an  ordinary
inverting  ampliﬁer  with  gain  –R f/R1.  The  load  voltage  is  an  ampliﬁed  and  inverted  (positive)  version  of  the
negative  variations  in  vin.  When  vin  becomes  positive,  vo  is  negative,  D1  is  forward  biased,  and  D2  is  reverse
biased. D1 shorts the output vo to  v–, which is held at virtual ground, so vL is 0.
