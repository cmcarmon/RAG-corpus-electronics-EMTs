elegraphy  captivated  George  Hamilton’s
interest while he was still a boy — to the
extent that he built a small telegraph line
himself,  from  sinking  the  poles  to  making  the
necessary  apparatus.  By  the  time  he  was  17,  he
was  the  manager  of  the  telegraph  ofﬁce  of  the
Atlantic  &  Great  Western  Railroad  at  Ravenna,
Ohio.  Hamilton  continued  to  hold  managerial
positions  with  telegraph  companies  until  1873
when he became assistant to Moses G. Farmer in
his  work  on  general  electrical  apparatus  and
machinery.
