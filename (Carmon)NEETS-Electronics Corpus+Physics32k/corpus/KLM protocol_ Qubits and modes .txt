To avoid losing generality, the discussion below does not limit itself to a particular instance of mode representation. A state written as

,

⟩

V
H




{\displaystyle |0,1\rangle _{VH}}
means a state with zero photons in mode



V


{\displaystyle V}
(could be the "vertical" polarization channel) and one photon in the mode



H


{\displaystyle H}
(could be the "horizontal" polarization channel).
In the KLM protocol, each of the photons is usually in one of two modes, and the modes are different between the photons (the possibility that a mode is occupied by more than one photon is zero). This is not the case only during implementations of controlled quantum gates such as CNOT. When the state of the system is as described, the photons can be distinguished, since they are in different modes, and therefore a qubit state can be represented using a single photon in two modes, vertical (V) and horizontal (H): for example,

and

≡

{\displaystyle |1\rangle \equiv |1,0\rangle _{VH}}
. It is common to refer to the states defined via occupation of modes as Fock states.
Such notations are useful in quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum cryptography. For example, it is very easy to consider a loss of a single photon using these notations, simply by adding the vacuum state

{\displaystyle |0,0\rangle _{VH}}
containing zero photons in those two modes. As another example, when having two photons in two separated modes (e.g. two time bins or two arms of an interferometer), it is easy to describe an entangled state of the two photons. The singlet state (two linked photons with overall spin quantum number

{\displaystyle s=0}
) can be described as follows: if
