Assuming that, on average, a simulation program executes 50 computer instructions per event on a computer
capable of processing 50 million instructions per second (MIP), Eq. 34.1 also shows that processing 400 billion
events  requires  140  h  or  just  short  of  6 days.  Fig. 34.14  shows  how  simulation  computation  generally  scales
with design complexity.
