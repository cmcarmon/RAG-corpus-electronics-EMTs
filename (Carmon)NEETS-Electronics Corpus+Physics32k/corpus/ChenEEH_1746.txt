Audio media is sound/speech converted into digital form using
sampling and quantization. Digitized audio media is trans-
mitted as a stream of discrete packets over the network. The
bandwidth requirements of digitized audio depend on its
dynamic range and/or spectrum. For example, telephone-
grade voice uses dynamic range reduction using the logarith-
mic A-law (Europe) or m-law (North America) capable of
reducing the linear range of 12 bits to nonlinear range of
only 8 bits. This reduces the throughput from 96 kbps to
64 kbps. A number of compression schemes (Garg, 1999)
along with their bit rates, as illustrated in Table 7.2, are com-
monly used for audio media types.
