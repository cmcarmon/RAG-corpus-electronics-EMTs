Row IE denotes the additional equation 3.2 added to nodal
analysis, and Col. IE is the additional column in matrix due to
the current through the voltage source. The vector RHS denotes
the right-hand side and contains known values of sources. This
method is called modiﬁed nodal analysis (MNA) because of
the modiﬁcations made to nodal analysis to allow different
