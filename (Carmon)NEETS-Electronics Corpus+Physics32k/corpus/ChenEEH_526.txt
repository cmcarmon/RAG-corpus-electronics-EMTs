Often, the hole contribution to the conductivity of an n-type
semiconductor can be neglected because the hole concentra-
tion is many orders of magnitude smaller than the electron
concentration. Likewise, the electron contribution to the con-
ductivity of a p-type semiconductor can often be neglected.
