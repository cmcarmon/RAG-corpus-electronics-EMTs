Evolution  has  played  a  role  in  the  development  of  these  unique  neurons  and  in  the  arrangement  and
development of interconnections between nerve cells in the various parts of the brain. Since the brain is a most
complex organ, it contains numerous regions designed for speciﬁc tasks. One might, in fact, consider it to be
a collection of organs arranged together to act in the harmony of activity we recognize as the individual’s state
of consciousness or as life itself. Over the years, anatomists and physiologists have identiﬁed and named most
pathways  (tracts),  most  groups  of  neurons  (nuclei),  and  most  of  the  major  parts  of  the  human  brain.  Such
attention to detail is certainly not necessary here. It will serve our purpose to simply provide a broad overview of
the organization of the brain and speak of three general regions: the brainstem, cerebellum, and the cerebral cortex.
The brainstem, or old brain, is really an extension and elaboration of the spinal chord. This section of the
brain evolved ﬁrst and is the location of all the centers that control the regulatory systems, such as respiration,
necessary  for  physical  survival  of  the  organism.  In  addition,  all  sensory  pathways  ﬁnd  their  way  into  the
brainstem, thereby permitting the integration of complex input patterns to take place within its domain.
