For Q greater than five, the radicals in the expressions for the two 0.707 fre-
quencies are within 1/2 percent of unity. In such a case,
it is reasonable to
neglect the small offset, and assume that the resonant curve is symmetric about
Ï‰o, as illustrated Figure 14.11b, and as summarized in the following equations:
