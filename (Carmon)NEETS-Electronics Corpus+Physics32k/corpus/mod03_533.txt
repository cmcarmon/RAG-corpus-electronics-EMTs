A thermal time-delay relay (fig. 3-23) is constructed to produce a delayed action when energized. Its
operation depends on the thermal action of a bimetallic element similar to that used in a thermal circuit
breaker. A heater is mounted around or near the element. The movable contact is mounted on the element
itself. As the heat causes the element to bend (because of the different thermal expansion rates), the
contacts close.
