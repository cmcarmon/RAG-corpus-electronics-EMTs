you to horizontal beam movement. However, in the oscilloscope this is not how horizontal deflection is
accomplished. Beam movement voltages are produced much faster by sawtooth circuitry. You may want
to review the sawtooth generation section in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and
Wave-Shaping Circuitry before continuing. Nearly all oscilloscopes with electrostatic deflection apply a
sawtooth voltage to the horizontal plates to produce horizontal deflection of the beam, as shown in
figure 6-12.
