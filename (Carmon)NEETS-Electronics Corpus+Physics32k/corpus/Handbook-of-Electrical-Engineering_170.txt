Fuse Performance
average  melting
Fuse  performance  characteristics  under  overload  conditions  are  published  in  the  form  of 
Fuses are tested with a variety of currents, and
timeâ€“current characteristic curves, 
the melting times are recorded. The result is a graph of time versus current coordinates that are plotted on log-
log scale, as illustrated in Fig. 1.33.
