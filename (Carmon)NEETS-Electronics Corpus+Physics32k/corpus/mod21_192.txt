3,000 volts can be easily generated, especially under low-humidity conditions. ESD damage of ESDS
parts or circuit assemblies is possible whenever two or more pins of any of these devices are electrically
exposed or have low impedance paths. Similarly, an ESDS device in a printed-circuit board or even in
another pcb that is electrically connected in a series can be damaged if it provides a path to ground. ESD
damage can occur during the manufacture of equipment or during the servicing of the equipment. Damage
can occur anytime devices or assemblies are handled, replaced, tested, or inserted into a connector.
