somewhat conﬁning because of one needs to make payment
arrangements and also obtain a password for each use. Differ-
ent hot spots are also often run by different Internet service
providers, so paying just one provider will not always guaran-
tee service at all hot spot zones. In addition, most hot spots
only offer minimal if any security. Most clerks at these places
have no idea of how to turn on the security features of their
deployed WLAN. IEEE 802.11 network architecture can be
conﬁgured in two different ways. One way is the independent
basic service set (IBSS), also often referred to as an ad hoc
network or even a peer-to-peer mode (see Figure 6.5). In an ad
hoc network, 802.11 wireless stations in the same cell or in the
transmission range of each other communicate directly with
one another without using any connection to a wired network.
This kind of network is usually only formed on a temporary
basis and put up and taken down rather quickly. These net-
works usually are of small size and have a focused purpose. A
business meeting in a conference room where employees bring
laptops to share information is a good example of this type of
network.
