If the physical size of a cell has no impact on its voltage, then what does it affect? The
answer is resistance, which in turn affects the maximum amount of current that a cell can
provide. Every voltaic cell contains some amount of internal resistance due to the electrodes
and the electrolyte. The larger a cell is constructed, the greater the electrode contact area with
the electrolyte, and thus the less internal resistance it will have.
