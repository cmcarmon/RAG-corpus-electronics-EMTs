schematic  capture
techniques.  Schematic  capture  deﬁnes  hierarchical  structures,  commonly  called 
,  of  components.  A
designer  creates  instances  of  components  supplied  from  a  library  of  predeﬁned  components  and  connects
component pins or ports via wires [Douglas-Young, 1988; Pechet, 1991].
