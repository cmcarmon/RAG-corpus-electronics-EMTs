Take this circuit as an example. If we label four points in this circuit with the numbers 1,
2, 3, and 4, we will Ô¨Ånd that the amount of current conducted through the wire between points
1 and 2 is exactly the same as the amount of current conducted through the lamp (between
points 2 and 3). This same quantity of current passes through the wire between points 3 and
4, and through the battery (between points 1 and 4).
