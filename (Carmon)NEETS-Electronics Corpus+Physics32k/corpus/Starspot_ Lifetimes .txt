The lifetime for a starspot depends on its size.
For small spots the lifetime is proportional to their size, similar to spots on the Sun.
For large spots the sizes depend on the differential rotation of the star, but there are some indications that large spots which give rise to light variations can survive for many years even in stars with differential rotation.
