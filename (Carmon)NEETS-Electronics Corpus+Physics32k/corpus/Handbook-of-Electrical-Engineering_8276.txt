  occur  when  two  or  more  lines  are  shorted  together.  There  are  two  main  problems  in  the
analysis  of  bridging  faults:  (1)  the  theoretical  number  of  possible  such  faults  is  extremely  high  and  (2)  the
operational  effect  is  of  a  wired  logic  AND  or  OR,  depending  on  technology,  and  it  can  even  have  different
effects in complex CMOS gates.
