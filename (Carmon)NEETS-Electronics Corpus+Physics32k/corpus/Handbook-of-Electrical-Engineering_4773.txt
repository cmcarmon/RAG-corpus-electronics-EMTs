When PZT ceramic material is prepared, the crystallites and domains are randomly oriented, and therefore
the material does not exhibit any piezoelectric behavior [Fig. 49.2(a)]. The random nature of the displacements
for the individual crystallites causes the net displacement to average to zero when an external ﬁeld is applied.
The tetragonal axis has three equivalent directions 90(cid:176) apart and the material can be poled by reorienting the
polarization of the domains into a direction nearest the applied ﬁeld. When a sufﬁciently high ﬁeld is applied,
some but not all of the domains will be rotated toward the electric ﬁeld through the allowed angle 90(cid:176) or 180(cid:176).
If the ﬁeld is raised further, eventually all domains will be oriented as close as possible to the direction of the
ﬁeld. Note however, that the polarization will not point exactly in the direction of the ﬁeld [Fig. 49.2(b)]. At
this  point,  no  further  domain  motion  is  possible  and  the  material  is  saturated.  As  the  ﬁeld  is  reduced,  the
majority of domains retain the orientation they had with the ﬁeld on leaving the material in an oriented state
which now has a net polarization. Poling is accomplished for commercial PZT by raising the temperature to
