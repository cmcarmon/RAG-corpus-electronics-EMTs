Typically, ﬁlter applications have sharp transitions between
passbands and stopbands and have complex poles close to
the jv axis; that is, their quality factors, Qi, are large. The
realization of such high-Q poles requires circuit impedances
that change their values with frequency very rapidly. This
problem has been solved traditionally with resonance: the
implementation requires inductors, L, and capacitors, C,
because RC circuits have poles only on the negative real axis
in the s-plane where Q  1=2. Because inductors are large and
bulky, LC circuits cannot easily be miniaturized (except at the
highest frequencies) so that other approaches are needed for
ﬁlters in modern communications and controls systems. A
popular and widely used solution that avoids bulky inductors
makes use of the fact that complex high-Q pole pairs can be
implemented by combining RC circuits with gain. Gain in
active circuits is most commonly provided by the operational
ampliﬁer, the op-amp, or sometimes by the operational trans-
conductance ampliﬁer (OTA). It is very easy to see that com-
plex poles can indeed be obtained from active RC circuits.
Consider an inverting lossy integrator, as shown in Figure
4.2(A), and a noninverting lossless (ideal) integrator, as
shown in Figure 4.2(B). Using conductances, G ¼ 1=R, and
assuming the op-amps are ideal, the lossy and lossless integra-
tors, respectively, realize the functions:
