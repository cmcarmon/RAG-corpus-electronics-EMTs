When the voltage across a capacitor is increased, it draws current from the rest of the
circuit, acting as a power load. In this condition the capacitor is said to be charging, because
there is an increasing amount of energy being stored in its electric Ô¨Åeld. Note the direction of
electron current with regard to the voltage polarity:
