There  are  a  large  number  of  organic  esters,  but  only  a  few  are  suitable  for  electrical  applications.  Their
properties  are  adversely  affected  by  hydrolysis,  oxidation,  and  water  content.  Due  to  their  reduced  dielectric
losses at elevated frequencies, they have been used in high-frequency capacitors. Castor oil has found specialized
application  in  energy  storage  capacitors  due  to  its  exceptional  resistance  to  partial  discharges.  The  dielectric
constants of esters are substantially higher than those for mineral oils.
