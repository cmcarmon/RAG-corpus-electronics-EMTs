Phase Distortion
When the phase shift (q) in the output signal of an ampliÔ¨Åer is not proportional to the frequency, the output
does not preserve the form of the input signal, resulting in phase distortion. If the phase shift is proportional
to frequency, different frequency components have a constant delay time (q/w) and no distortion is observed.
In TV applications phase distortion can result in a smeared picture.
