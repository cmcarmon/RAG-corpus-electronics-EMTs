Raw multimedia data require vast amount of storage, and,
therefore, they are usually stored in a compressed format.
Slow storage devices (e.g., CD-ROMs and hard disk drives)
do not support playback/display of uncompressed multimedia
data (especially of video and audio) in real-time. The term
compression refers to removal of redundancy from data. The
more redundancy in the data is reduced, the higher the com-
pression ratio is achieved. The method by which redundancy
is eliminated to increase data compression is known as source
coding. In essence, the same (or nearly the same) information
is represented using fewer data bits. There are several other
reasons behind the popularity of compression techniques and
standards for multimedia data:
