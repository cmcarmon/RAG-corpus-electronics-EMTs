The  above  properties  are  particularly  useful  in  CT  system  analysis  and  design,  especially  when  the  system
characteristics are easily speciﬁed in the frequency domain, as in linear ﬁltering. Note that Properties 1, 6, and
7 are useful for solving differential or integral equations. Property 4 (time-domain convolution) provides the
