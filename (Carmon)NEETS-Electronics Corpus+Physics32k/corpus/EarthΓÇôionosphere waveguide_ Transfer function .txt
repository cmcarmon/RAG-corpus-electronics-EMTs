The prototype of a short vertical rod antenna is a vertical electric Hertz dipole in which electric alternating currents of frequency f flow. Its radiation of electromagnetic waves within the Earth-ionospheric waveguide can be described by a transfer function T(ρ,ω):
(2)   Ez(ρ,ω) = T(ρ,ω) Eo(ρ,ω)
where Ez is the vertical component of the electric field at the receiver in a distance ρ from the transmitter, Eo is the electric field of a Hertzian dipole in free space, and ω = 2πf the angular frequency. In free space, it is T = 1. Evidently, the Earth–ionosphere waveguide is dispersive because the transfer function depends on frequency. This means that phase- and group velocity of the waves are frequency dependent.
