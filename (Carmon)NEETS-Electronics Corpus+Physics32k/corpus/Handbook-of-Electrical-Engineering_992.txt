Step 8 is the only step that ﬁts in the saturation region. The use of parameters VMAX and KAPPA is obvious,
but one may question using ETA to ﬁt in the saturation region. The parameter ETA adjusts the threshold voltage
with respect to Vds , and as such one could argue that ETA should be used to ﬁt measurements of Ids sweeping
Vg s  and stepping Vds  to high values. In doing so, one will corrupt the ﬁt in the saturation region, and usually
we want to ﬁt the saturation region better at the expense of the linear region.
