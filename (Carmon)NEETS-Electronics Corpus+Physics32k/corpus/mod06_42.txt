One basic difference in electronic circuits that will at first seem to violate the basic laws is that
electrons flow across a gap, a break in the circuit in which there appears to be no conductor. A large part
of the field of electronics and the entire field of electron tubes are concerned with the flow and control of
these electrons "across the gap." The following paragraphs will explain this interesting phenomenon.
