  BJT.  Unlike  the  TTL  family,
however, which switches the transistors into saturation when turning them on, ECL switching is designed to
prevent driving the transistors into saturation. Whenever bipolar transistors are driven into saturation, their
switching speed will be limited by the charge carrier storage delay, a transistor operational characteristic. Thus,
the switching speed of ECL circuits will be signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than for TTL circuits. ECL operation is based
