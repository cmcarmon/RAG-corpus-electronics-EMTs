Urine flow rate or urinary flow rate is the volumetric flow rate of urine during urination. It is a measure of the quantity of urine excreted in a specified period of time (per second or per minute). It is measured with uroflowmetry, a type of flowmetry.
The letters "V" (for volume) and "Q" (a conventional symbol for flow rate) are both used as a symbol for urine flow rate. The V often has a dot (overdot), that is, VÌ‡ ("V-dot"). Qmax indicates the maximum flow rate. Qmax is used as an indicator for the diagnosis of enlarged prostate. A lower Qmax may indicate that the enlarged prostate puts pressure on the urethra, partially occluding it.
Uroflowmetry is performed by urinating into a special urinal, toilet, or disposable device that has a measuring device built in. The average rate changes with age.
