FET switches offer signiﬁcant advantages over BJT switches. An FET switch does not draw
current from a previous stage because the gate current of an FET is practically zero. Consequently,
no signiﬁcant power-loading effects are present, whereas BJTs, in contrast, do load down previous
stages. Another advantage of FETs is that their logic voltage levels (typically, VDD = 15 V) are
higher than those of the BJTs (typically, VCC = 5 V). Thus, the FET logic circuits tend to tolerate
more noise than the comparable BJT logic circuits. However, their switching speeds tend to be
somewhat smaller than those for BJTs in view of the larger inherent capacitances of the FETs.
