As we have seen before, the rotor is never able to reach synchronous speed. If it did, there would be
no voltage induced in the rotor. No torque would be developed. The motor would not operate. The
difference between rotor speed and synchronous speed is called slip. The difference between these two
speeds is not great. For example, a rotor speed of 3400 to 3500 rpm can be expected from a synchronous
speed of 3600 rpm.
