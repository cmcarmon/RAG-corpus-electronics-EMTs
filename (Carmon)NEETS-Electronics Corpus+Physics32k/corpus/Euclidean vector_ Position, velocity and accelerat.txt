The position of a point x = (x1, x2, x3) in three-dimensional space can be represented as a position vector whose base point is the origin

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }=x_{1}{\mathbf {e} }_{1}+x_{2}{\mathbf {e} }_{2}+x_{3}{\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}

The position vector has dimensions of length.
Given two points x = (x1, x2, x3), y = (y1, y2, y3) their displacement is a vector

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {y} }-{\mathbf {x} }=(y_{1}-x_{1}){\mathbf {e} }_{1}+(y_{2}-x_{2}){\mathbf {e} }_{2}+(y_{3}-x_{3}){\mathbf {e} }_{3}.}

which specifies the position of y relative to x. The length of this vector gives the straight-line distance from x to y. Displacement has the dimensions of length.
The velocity v of a point or particle is a vector, its length gives the speed. For constant velocity the position at time t will be

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {x} }_{t}=t{\mathbf {v} }+{\mathbf {x} }_{0},}

where x0 is the position at time t=0. Velocity is the time derivative of position. Its dimensions are length/time.
Acceleration a of a point is vector which is the time derivative of velocity. Its dimensions are length/time2.
