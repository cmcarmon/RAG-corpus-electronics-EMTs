The receiver converts the optical signal exiting the fiber back into an electrical signal. The receiver
consists of two parts, the optical detector and the signal-conditioning circuits. An optical detector detects
the optical signal. The signal-conditioning circuit conditions the detector output so that the receiver output
matches the original input to the transmitter. The receiver should amplify and process the optical signal
without introducing noise or signal distortion. Noise is any disturbance that obscures or reduces the
quality of the signal. Noise effects and limitations of the signal-conditioning circuits cause the distortion
of the receiver's electrical output signal.
