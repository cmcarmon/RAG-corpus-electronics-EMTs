In summary, the most important point to remember about the PN junction diode is its ability to offer
very little resistance to current flow in the forward-bias direction but maximum resistance to current flow
when reverse biased. A good way of illustrating this point is by plotting a graph of the applied voltage
versus the measured current. Figure 1-20 shows a plot of this voltage-current relationship (characteristic
curve) for a typical PN junction diode.
