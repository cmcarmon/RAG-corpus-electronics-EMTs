by a local hospital-based institutional review board. The FDA OfÔ¨Åce of Device Evaluation does approve some
new  devices,  after  careful  review,  for  clearly  limited  clinical  trials.  However,  information  on  such  limited,
temporary approval is not made available. Table 113.2 therefore shows only those devices which are presently
(July 1, 1996) approved and does not include experimental systems which may be undergoing currently limited
clinical trials. Some of the latter are discussed further on, based only on information furnished by manufacturers
or available from the published medical literature.
