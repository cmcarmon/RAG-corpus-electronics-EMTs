arithmetic and DSP functions. The literature describes many
adder cells with different characteristics such as transistor
count, speed, power consumption, and driving capabilities.
The choice of a library element not only depends on its
power characteristics but depends on the other characteristics
of the chosen component and the design speciﬁcation (such as
area and speed). The choice also depends on the context in
which such an element is used, which speciﬁes the inputs
driving the library element and the output loads of the driven
components.
