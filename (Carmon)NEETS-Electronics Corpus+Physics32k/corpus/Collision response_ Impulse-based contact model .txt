v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} (t)=m\mathbf {v} (t)}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (t)}
is the resulting change in velocity. The change in momentum, termed an impulse and denoted by

{\displaystyle j\in \mathbb {R} ^{3}}
is thus computed as

For fixed impulse

{\displaystyle t_{1}\rightarrow t_{0}\Rightarrow \left|\mathbf {f} \right|\rightarrow \infty }
, that is, a smaller time interval must be compensated by a stronger reaction force to achieve the same impulse. When modelling a collision between idealized rigid bodies, it is impractical to simulate the compression and expansion phases of the body geometry over the collision time interval. However, by assuming that a force




f



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} }
can be found which is equal to



0


{\displaystyle 0}
everywhere except at




t

{\displaystyle t_{0}}
, and such that the limit

exists and is equal to




j



{\displaystyle \mathbf {j} }
, the notion of instantaneous impulses may be introduced to simulate an instantaneous change in velocity after a collision.
