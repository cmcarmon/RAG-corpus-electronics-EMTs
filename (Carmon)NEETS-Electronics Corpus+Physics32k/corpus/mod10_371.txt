As the lowest region of the Earth's atmosphere, the troposphere extends from the Earth's surface to a 
height of slightly over 7 miles. Virtually all weather phenomena occur in this region. Generally, the 
troposphere is characterized by a steady decrease in both temperature and pressure as height is increased. 
However, the many changes in weather phenomena cause variations in humidity and an uneven heating of 
the Earth's surface. As a result, the air in the troposphere is in constant motion. This motion causes small 
turbulences, or eddies, to be formed, as shown by the bouncing of aircraft entering turbulent areas of the 
atmosphere. These turbulences are most intense near the Earth's surface and gradually diminish with 
height. They have a refractive quality that permits the refracting or scattering of radio waves with short 
wavelengths. This scattering provides enhanced communications at higher frequencies.
