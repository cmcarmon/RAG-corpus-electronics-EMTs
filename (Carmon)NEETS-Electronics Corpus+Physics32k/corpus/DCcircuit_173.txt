Ohmâ€™s Law is a simple and powerful mathematical tool for helping us analyze electric cir-
cuits, but it has limitations, and we must understand these limitations in order to properly
apply it to real circuits. For most conductors, resistance is a rather stable property, largely
unaffected by voltage or current. For this reason we can regard the resistance of many circuit
components as a constant, with voltage and current being directly related to each other.
