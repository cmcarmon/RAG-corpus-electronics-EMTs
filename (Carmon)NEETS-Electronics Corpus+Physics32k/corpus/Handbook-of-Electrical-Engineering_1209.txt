The weak-point convergence theorem (1) was ﬁrst proven by Bregman [1965], while the strong-point conver-
gence theorem (2) was developed by Stiles [1965]. It is important to appreciate what this theorem does and
does not say. Speciﬁcally, although it ensures that sequence (14.95) converges to a vector contained in the set
intersection C, this convergent point need not minimize the original signal restoration criterion (14.73). This
is the price paid when considering the more general case of closed convex attribute sets. Nonetheless, it is found
that the vector to which sequence (14.95) converges often provides a satisfactory approximation.
