The state of the system at any time



t


{\displaystyle t}
is given by the phase space of all the classical particles, the quantum amplitudes, and the adiabatic state. The simulation broadly consists of the following steps:
Step 1. Initialize the state of the system. The classical positions and velocities are chosen based on the ensemble required.
Step 2. Compute forces using Hellmann-Feynman theorem, and integrate the equations of motion by time step



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
to obtain the classical phase space at time

Step 3. Integrate the Schrödinger equation to evolve quantum amplitudes from time

to

t


{\displaystyle t+\Delta t}
in increments of

{\displaystyle \delta t}

{\displaystyle \delta t}
is typically much smaller than

Step 4. Compute probability of hopping from current state to all other states. Generate a random number, and determine whether a switch should take place. If a switch does occur, change velocities to conserve energy. Go back to step 2, till trajectories have been evolved for the desired time.
