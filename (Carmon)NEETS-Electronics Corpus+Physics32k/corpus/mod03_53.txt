In the discussion and explanation of electrical and electronic circuits, the quantities in the circuit
(voltage, current, and resistance) are important. If you can measure the electrical quantities in a circuit, it
is easier to understand what is happening in that circuit. This is especially true when you are
troubleshooting defective circuits. By measuring the voltage, current, capacitance, inductance, impedance,
and resistance in a circuit, you can determine why the circuit is not doing what it is supposed to do. For
instance, you can determine why a radio is not receiving or transmitting, why your automobile will not
start, or why an electric oven is not working. Measurement will also assist you in determining why an
electrical component (resistor, capacitor, inductor) is not doing its job.
