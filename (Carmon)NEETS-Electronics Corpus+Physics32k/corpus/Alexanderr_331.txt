Consider a series combination of a resistor and an initially charged
capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. (The resistor and capacitor may be the
equivalent  resistance  and  equivalent  capacitance  of  combinations  of
resistors  and  capacitors.)  Our  objective  is  to  determine  the  circuit
response,  which,  for  pedagogic  reasons,  we  assume  to  be  the  voltage
