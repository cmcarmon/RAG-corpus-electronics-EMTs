This law is also called Kirchhoff's first law, Kirchhoff's point rule, or Kirchhoff's junction rule (or nodal rule).
The principle of conservation of electric charge implies that:
At any node (junction) in an electrical circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node
or equivalently
The algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero.
Recalling that current is a signed (positive or negative) quantity reflecting direction towards or away from a node, this principle can be stated as:





∑

k
=
1


n




I


k


=
0


{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}{I}_{k}=0}

n is the total number of branches with currents flowing towards or away from the node.
This formula is valid for complex currents:





∑

k
=
1


n






I
~




k


=
0


{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}{\tilde {I}}_{k}=0}

The law is based on the conservation of charge whereby the charge (measured in coulombs) is the product of the current (in amperes) and the time (in seconds).
