If the open-loop transfer function



G
(
s
)


{\displaystyle G(s)}
has a zero pole of multiplicity



l


{\displaystyle l}
, then the Nyquist plot has a discontinuity at



ω
=
0


{\displaystyle \omega =0}
. During further analysis it should be assumed that the phasor travels



l


{\displaystyle l}
times clock-wise along a semicircle of infinite radius. After applying this rule, the zero poles should be neglected, i.e. if there are no other unstable poles, then the open-loop transfer function



G
(
s
)


{\displaystyle G(s)}
should be considered stable.
If the open-loop transfer function



G
(
s
)


{\displaystyle G(s)}
is stable, then the closed-loop system is unstable for any encirclement of the point -1.
If the open-loop transfer function



G
(
s
)


{\displaystyle G(s)}
is unstable, then there must be one counter clock-wise encirclement of -1 for each pole of



G
(
s
)


{\displaystyle G(s)}
in the right-half of the complex plane.
The number of surplus encirclements (greater than N+P) is exactly the number of unstable poles of the closed-loop system.
However, if the graph happens to pass through the point



−
1
+
j
0


{\displaystyle -1+j0}
, then deciding upon even the marginal stability of the system becomes difficult and the only conclusion that can be drawn from the graph is that there exist zeros on the



j
ω


{\displaystyle j\omega }
axis.
