Code Performance
The improvement in the performance of a digital communication system that can be achieved by the use of
coding is illustrated in Fig. 70.4. It is assumed that a digital signal plus channel noise is present at the receiver
input. The performance of a system that uses binary-phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) signaling is shown both for the
case when coding is used and for the case when there is no coding. For the BPSK no code case, Pe = Q (
).
For the coded case a (23,12) Golay code is used; Pe is the probability of bit error—also called the bit error rate
(BER)—that is measured at the receiver output.
