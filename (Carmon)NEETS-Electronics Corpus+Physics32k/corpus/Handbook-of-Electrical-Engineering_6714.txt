In the case of data transmission, a lost cell will result in an unusable frame unless the data is encoded to
guard against cell loss prior to transmission. Coding might be provided by the AAL, for example. The trade-
offs involved in coding and retransmission and their impact upon network throughput, delay and complexity
are not well understood at the time of this writing. Part of the reason for this is that cell loss probability and
