is predictable only when these simple circuits are con-
nected to resistances greater than they are. For exam-
ple, if the 1-volt drop in Figure 17-13 were supplying a 
load less than approximately 10 kÎ©, then, because it is 
in parallel with R3, the load would reduce its value, thus 
changing the voltage divider action (Figure 17-15).
