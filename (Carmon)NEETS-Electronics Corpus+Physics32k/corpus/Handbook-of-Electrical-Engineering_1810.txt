Comparison  methods  require  the  subjects  to  compare  a  distorted  test  picture  with  a  reference  picture.
Distortion is added to the test picture until both pictures appear of the same quality to the subject. Viewing
conditions can have a great impact on the results of such tests. Care must be taken in the experimental design
to avoid biases in the results.
