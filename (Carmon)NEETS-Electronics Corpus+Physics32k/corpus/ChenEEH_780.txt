Experimental Results
We now present
the experimental results on the above
described vocoder algorithm. Here, the initial algorithm repre-
sents the reference initial algorithm, the in-place mapped
algorithm represents the initial algorithm with in-place data
mapping, and the globally optimized algorithm comprises
both in-place data mapping and loop transformations.
