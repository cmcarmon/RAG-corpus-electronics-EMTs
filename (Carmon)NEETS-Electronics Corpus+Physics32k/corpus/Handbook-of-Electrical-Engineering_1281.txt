where † designates the pseudo matrix inverse operator while x(q)
r are the ﬁrst and remaining p columns,
respectively, of the rank-q approximation matrix X (q). In a very similar fashion, the Tufts-Kumaresan method
is obtained by ﬁrst determining the rank-q approximation of submatrix Xr which is here denoted by X (q)
rkt [Tufts
and Kumaresan, 1982]. The corresponding coefﬁcient vector is then given by
