Air cylinders are available in a variety of sizes and can typically range from a small 2.5 mm (1‚ÅÑ10 in) air cylinder, which might be used for picking up a small transistor or other electronic component, to 400 mm (16 in) diameter air cylinders which would impart enough force to lift a car. Some pneumatic cylinders reach 1,000 mm (39 in) in diameter, and are used in place of hydraulic cylinders for special circumstances where leaking hydraulic oil could impose an extreme hazard.
