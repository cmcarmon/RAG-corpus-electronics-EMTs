Normalization
Another important signal processing function for the detection of weak signals in the presence of unknown
and (temporal and spatial) varying noise is normalization. The statistics of noise or reverberation for oceans
typically varies in time, frequency, and/or bearing from measurement to measurement and location to location.
To detect a weak signal in a broadband, nonstationary, and inhomogeneous background, it is usually desirable
to  make  the  noise  background  statistics  as  uniform  as  possible  for  the  variations  in  time,  frequency,  and/or
bearing. The noise background estimates are Ô¨Årst obtained from a window of resolution cells (which usually
surrounds the test data cell). These estimates are then used to normalize the test cell, thus reducing the effects
of the background noise on detection. Window length and distance from the test cell are two of the parameters
that can be adjusted to obtain accurate estimates of the different types of stationary or nonstationary noise.
