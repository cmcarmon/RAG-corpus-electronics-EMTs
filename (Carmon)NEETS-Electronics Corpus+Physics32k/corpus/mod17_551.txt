Satellite communications are becoming well established in the Navy. In October 1983 the 
Department of the Navy established the Naval Space Command, which assumed operational 
responsibility for Navy space systems plus coordination responsibility with other operational activities. 
Most ships have satellite communications capability. New systems have been installed on ships and are 
fully compatible with other electronic systems and equipment. Communications via satellite has increased 
existing Navy communications capabilities for the command and control of naval forces. Satellite 
communications has not replaced all existing means of radio communications. However, it is a major step 
in modernizing Navy communications. It has relieved the Navy of its total dependence on hf radio 
transmission and reduced the need for many hf ground stations overseas.
