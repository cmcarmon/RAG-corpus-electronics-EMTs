Physical faults can be temporary or permanent.
Permanent faults lead to a continuing error and are typically due to some physical failure such as metal electromigration or dielectric breakdown.
Temporary faults include transient and intermittent faults.
Transient (a.k.a. soft) faults lead to independent one-time errors and are not due to permanent hardware faults: examples include alpha particles flipping a memory bit, electromagnetic noise, or power-supply fluctuations.
Intermittent faults occur due to a weak system component, e.g. circuit parameters degrading, leading to errors that are likely to recur.
