The two CISCs do almost all of their passing and saving on the stack. The call block will be built on the
stack;  the  return  address  will  be  put  on  the  stack;  saved  registers  will  be  put  on  the  stack.  Only  a  few  stack
references are passed forward in register; the value returned by the function will be passed back in register.
