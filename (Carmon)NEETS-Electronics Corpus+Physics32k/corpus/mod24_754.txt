The simplest fiber optic receivers consist of only the optical detector and a load resistor. However,
the output signal of these simple receivers is not in a suitable form for most types of interfacing circuitry.
To produce a suitable signal, a preamplifier, a post amplifier, and other circuitry are generally included in
the receiver.
