There are three "classical" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are:
gravitational redshift
gravitational lensing (generally tested around the Sun)
anomalous perihelion advance of the planets (see Tests of general relativity)
Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity.
In 1964, Irwin I. Shapiro found a fourth test, called the Shapiro delay. It is usually regarded as a "classical" test as well.
