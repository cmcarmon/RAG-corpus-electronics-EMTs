Avionics (aviation electronics) systems perform many functions: (1) for both military and civil aircraft, avionics
are  used  for  ﬂight  controls,  guidance,  navigation,  communications,  and  surveillance;  and  (2)  for  military
aircraft, avionics also may be used for electronic warfare, reconnaissance, ﬁre control, and weapons guidance
and control. These functions are achieved by the application of the principles presented in other chapters of
this  handbook,  e.g.,  signal  processing,  electromagnetic,  communications,  etc.  The  reader  is  directed  to  these
chapters  for  additional  information  on  these  topics.  This  section  focuses  on  the  system  concepts  and  issues
unique to avionics that provide the traditional functions listed in (1) above.
