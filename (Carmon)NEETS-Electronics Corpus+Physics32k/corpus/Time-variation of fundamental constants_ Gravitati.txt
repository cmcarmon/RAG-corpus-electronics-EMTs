The gravitational constant G is difficult to measure with precision, and conflicting measurements in the 2000s have inspired the controversial suggestions of a periodic variation of its value in a 2015 paper. However, while its value isn't known to great precision, the possibility of observing type Ia supernovae which happened in the universe's remote past, paired with the assumption that the physics involved in these events is universal, allows for an upper bound of less than 10âˆ’10 per year for the gravitational constant over the last nine billion years.
As a dimensional quantity, the value of the gravitational constant and its possible variation will depend on the choice of units; in Planck units, for example, its value is G=1 by definition. A meaningful test on the time-variation of G is equivalent to the test on the time-variation of the gravitational coupling constant, the ratio of gravitational attraction and electrostatic repulsion between two electrons (or, equivalently, the square of the electron mass in Planck units).
