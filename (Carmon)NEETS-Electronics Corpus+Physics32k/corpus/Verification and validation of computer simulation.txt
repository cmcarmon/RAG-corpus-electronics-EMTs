A model that has face validity appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system. Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies. An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases. Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity. For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.
