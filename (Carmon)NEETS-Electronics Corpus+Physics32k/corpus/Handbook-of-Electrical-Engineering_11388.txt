Ultrasound is typically used to image soft body tissues such as liver, but the sound beam often travels through
ﬂuids, for example, through amniotic ﬂuid when imaging the fetus. Generally, bone and lung are not imaged
with ultrasound. The attenuation processes include absorption, which is the conversion of acoustic energy to
heat, and scattering, which will be addressed later. The attenuation increases roughly linearly with frequency
in the 2- to 10-MHz range typically used for medical imaging. This range represents a compromise between
increased penetration at lower frequencies (because of decreased attenuation) and improved resolution asso-
ciated with higher frequencies as discussed below. Thus, the lower frequencies are used when greater penetration
is required, such as for fetal imaging in the obese patient, and higher frequencies for lesser penetration, such
as the examination of peripheral vascular ﬂow.
