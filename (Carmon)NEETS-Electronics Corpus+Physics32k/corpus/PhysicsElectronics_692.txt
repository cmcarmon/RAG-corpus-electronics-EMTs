(e) Suppose now that the impedance Z1 is replaced with a capacitor with a capaci-
tance C (Z2 = 10 kΩ). For frequencies much greater than 4 Hz, the 741 op-amp
will attenuate the signal if the product RC is greater than some maximum value.
For a frequency of 50 kHz, what is the maximum value for C for which the op-
amp [A(ω)] will not attenuate the output signal at high frequencies? Hint: If you
sketch A(ω) and G(ω), you will be able to see the constraint on G(ω).
