The armature is wound for a three-phase output, which will be covered later in this chapter.
Remember, a voltage is induced in a conductor if it is stationary and a magnetic field is passed across the
conductor, the same as if the field is stationary and the conductor is moved. The alternating voltage in the
ac generator armature windings is connected through fixed terminals to the ac load.
