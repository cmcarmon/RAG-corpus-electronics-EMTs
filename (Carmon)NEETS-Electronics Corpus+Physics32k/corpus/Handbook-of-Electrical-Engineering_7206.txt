In  CDMA  no  frequency  reuse  is  required.  Therefore,  every  cell  can  have  the  same  120  channels:  number  of
channels/cell  (in  CDMA).  In  cellular,  because  the  frequency  reuse  factor  is  applied  on  FDMA  and  TDMA
schemes but not on CDMA, therefore, cellular CDMA has a greater spectrum efÔ¨Åciency than cellular FDMA
or TDMA [Lee, May 1991].
