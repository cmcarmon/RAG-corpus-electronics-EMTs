the source. When only the drain-to-source voltage 
(EDS) is applied, a drain current does not flow. This 
is  because there is no conducting channel between 
the source and drain. When the gate is made negative 
with  respect to the source, holes are drawn toward the 
gate, where they gather to create a P-type channel that 
allows current to flow from the drain to the source. 
When the negative gate voltage is increased, the size of 
the channel increases, allowing even more current to 
flow. An increase in gate voltage tends to enhance the 
drain current.
