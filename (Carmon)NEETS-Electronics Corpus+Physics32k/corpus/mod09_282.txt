One version of a SERIES-FED HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is shown in figure 2-13. The tank circuit 
consists of the tapped coil (L1 and L2) and capacitor C2. The feedback circuit is from the tank circuit to 
the base of Q1 through the coupling capacitor C1. Coupling capacitor C1 prevents the low dc resistance 
of L2 from placing a short across the emitter-to-base junction and resistor RE. Capacitor C3 bypasses the 
sine-wave signal around the battery, and resistor RE is used for temperature stabilization to prevent 
thermal runaway. Degeneration is prevented by CE in parallel with RE. The amount of bias is determined 
by the values of RB, the emitter-to-base resistance, the small amount of dc resistance of coil L1, and the 
resistance of RE.
