in shape. Connections to these electrodes form the electrical port for the transducer and the voltage between
them creates a spatially uniform electric ﬁeld in the active region, and this time-varying electric ﬁeld couples
to  the  acoustic  waves  propagating  between  the  electrodes.  If  the  planar  electrodes  are  many  wavelengths  in
transverse dimensions and the active region is much thinner, and if the axial direction is a pure mode direction
for the piezoelectric, the waves in the active region can be considered as plane waves. We then have the one-
dimensional geometry considered earlier. The transducer may be in contact with another elastic medium on
either side, as indicated in Fig. 48.2, so that the plane waves propagate in and out of the active regions in the
cross-sectional region shown. Thus, the transducer has in general two acoustic ports for coupling to the outside
world as well as the electrical port.
