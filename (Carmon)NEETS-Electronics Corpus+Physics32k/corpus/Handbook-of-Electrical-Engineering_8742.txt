One of the most difﬁcult concepts to adjust to when using the procedural paradigm is the idea that all things
are  functions.  The  most  signiﬁcant  implication  of  this  kind  of  thinking  is  the  replacement  of  loops  with
recursion and branches with guards. Recall that everything is a function that must return a value—even control
structures. To illustrate, consider the functional (non-LISP) equivalent of the summation loop in FORTRAN,
below.
