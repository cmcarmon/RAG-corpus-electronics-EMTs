It is obvious that the initially unknown echo path H(z) has to be “learned” by the canceller. It is also clear
that for adaptation to work there needs to be a nonzero input signal x(t) that excites all the eigenmodes of the
system (resonances, or “peaks” of the system magnitude response *H(jv)*). Another important problem is how
to handle double-talk (speakers at both ends are talking simultaneously). In such a case, the canceller could
easily get confused by the speech from the near end that acts as an uncorrelated noise in the adaptation. Finally,
the convergence rate, that is, how fast the canceller adapts to a change in the echo path, is an important measure
to compare different algorithms.
