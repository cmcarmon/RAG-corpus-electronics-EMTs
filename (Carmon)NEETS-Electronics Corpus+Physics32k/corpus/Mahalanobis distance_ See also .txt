Bregman divergence (the Mahalanobis distance is an example of a Bregman divergence)
Bhattacharyya distance related, for measuring similarity between data sets (and not between a point and a data set)
Hamming distance identifies the difference bit by bit of two strings
Hellinger distance, also a measure of distance between data sets
Similarity learning, for other approaches to learn a distance metric from examples.
