Decade resistors (also referred to as decade boxes) typically are precision devices. Depending on the
make and model of the decade resistor, it may be capable of providing you with a selection of resistors
ranging in value from a small fraction of an ohm to hundreds of megohms. Decade resistors are
commonly used in calibration laboratories and in engineering design applications. Like the fixed rf
attenuator, most decade resistors are capable of handling only small amounts of current. They are very
limited in respect to frequency capabilities and are commonly used in dc-circuit applications. You may
encounter specific equipment that requires the use of a decade resistor in performing your maintenance
tests or alignments. To test a decade resistor, you can connect a standard multimeter or digital multimeter
directly across its resistance terminals and read its resistance on the meter. This test will only indicate
gross errors in the decade resistor such as an open or a badly damaged resistor. If you are performing a
precision measurement or an alignment using a decade resistor and have any doubt as to its accuracy, you
should submit it to your servicing calibration laboratory. Figure 2-29 shows a typical decade resistor.
