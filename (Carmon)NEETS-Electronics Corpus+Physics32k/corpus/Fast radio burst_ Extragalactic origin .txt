Fast radio bursts have pulse dispersion measurements which are much larger (> 100 pc cmâˆ’3) than expected for a source inside the Milky Way; and consistent with propagation through an ionized plasma, and furthermore their distribution is isotropic (not especially coming from the galactic plane), thus they are conjectured to be of extragalactic origin.
The interferometer UTMOST has also put a lower limit of 10,000 kilometers for the distance to the FRBs it has detected, supporting the case for an astronomical origin (because signal sources on earth are ruled out as being closer than this limit). This limit can be determined from the fact that closer sources would have a curved wave front that could be detected by the multiple antennas of the interferometer.
