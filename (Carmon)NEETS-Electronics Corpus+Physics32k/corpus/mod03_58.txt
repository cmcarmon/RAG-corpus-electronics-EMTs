While an in-circuit meter will indicate that an electrical device is not functioning properly, the cause
of the malfunction is determined by troubleshooting. Troubleshooting is the process of locating and
repairing faults in equipment after they have occurred. Since troubleshooting is covered elsewhere in this
training series, it will be mentioned here only as it applies to circuit measurement.
