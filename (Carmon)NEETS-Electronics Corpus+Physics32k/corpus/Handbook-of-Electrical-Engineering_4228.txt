The common form of the radar range equation uses power gain rather than directivity. Antenna gain is equal
to the directivity divided by the antenna losses. In the design and analysis of modern radars, directivity is a
more convenient measure of performance because it permits designs with distributed active elements, such as
solid-state phased arrays, to be assessed to permit direct comparison with passive antenna systems. Beamwidth
and directivity are inversely related; a highly directive antenna will have a narrow beamwidth. For typical design
parameters,
