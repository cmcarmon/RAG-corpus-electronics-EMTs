The speed at which energy or signals travel down a cable is actually the speed of the electromagnetic wave, not the movement of electrons. Electromagnetic wave propagation is fast and depends on both the permeability and the permittivity of the material. In a vacuum the wave travels at the speed of light and almost that fast in air.
