In contrast to the resistor, which exhibits an algebraic relation between its
branch current and voltage, the inductor does not. Rather, like the capacitor, it
exhibits an algebraic relation between its branch current and its flux linkage. Had
the core not been magnetically linear, this relation would have been nonlinear.
While most inductors exhibit such nonlinear behavior for sufficiently high B,
we will focus only on linear inductors.
