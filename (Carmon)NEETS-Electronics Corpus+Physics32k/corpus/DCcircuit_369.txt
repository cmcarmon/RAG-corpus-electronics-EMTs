The AFCI contains electronic circuitry to sense this intermittent resistive short circuit.
It protects against both hot to neutral and hot to ground arcs. The AFCI does not protect
against personal shock hazards like a GFCI does. Thus, GFCIs still need to be installed in
kitchen, bath, and outdoors circuits. Since the AFCI often trips upon starting large motors,
and more generally on brushed motors, its installation is limited to bedroom circuits by the
U.S. National Electrical code. Use of the AFCI should reduce the number of electrical Ô¨Åres.
However, nuisance-trips when running appliances with motors on AFCI circuits is a problem.
