their low sensitivities to component tolerances and to ﬁnite
vt-values of the op-amps. The ﬁrst is the four-ampliﬁer
Ackerberg-Mossberg biquad that may be called a universal
ﬁlter because it can implement any kind of second-order
transfer function. Then we shall consider the more restrictive
two-ampliﬁer GIC section that is derived from an RLC proto-
type and has been found to have excellent performance.
Finally, we shall present
the single-ampliﬁer Delyiannis-
Friend biquad, which is more sensitive than the previous
two circuits but may be used in applications where consider-
ations of cost and power consumption are critical.
