To simplify the equations, Newton writes F(r) in terms of a new function C(r)

{\displaystyle F(r)={\frac {C(r)}{Rr^{3}}}}

where R is the average radius of the nearly circular orbit. Newton expands C(r) in a series—now known as a Taylor expansion—in powers of the distance r, one of the first appearances of such a series. By equating the resulting inverse-cube force term with the inverse-cube force for revolving orbits, Newton derives an equivalent angular scaling factor k for nearly circular orbits：

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{k^{2}}}=\left({\frac {R}{C}}\right)\left.{\frac {dC}{dr}}\right|_{r=R}}

In other words, the application of an arbitrary central force F(r) to a nearly circular elliptical orbit can accelerate the angular motion by the factor k without affecting the radial motion significantly. If an elliptical orbit is stationary, the particle rotates about the center of force by 180° as it moves from one end of the long axis to the other (the two apses). Thus, the corresponding apsidal angle α for a general central force equals k×180°, using the general law θ2 = k θ1.
