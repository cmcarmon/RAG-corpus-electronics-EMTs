With  these  two  items,  we  obtain  the  response  as  the  capacitor  voltage
vC(t) ⫽ v(t) ⫽ v(0)e⫺t兾t.
Once  the  capacitor  voltage  is  ﬁrst  obtained,
other variables (capacitor current 
and resistor cur-
rent 
R is
often the Thevenin equivalent resistance at the terminals of the capacitor;
that is, we take out the capacitor C and ﬁnd
