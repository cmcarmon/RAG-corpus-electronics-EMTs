Next, the magnetic field around L2 collapses as the current from C2 stops. The action of the 
collapsing magnetic field causes the top of L2 to become negative at this instant. The negative charge 
causes capacitor C2 to begin to charge in the opposite direction. This negative potential is coupled to the 
base of Q1, opposing its forward bias. Most transistor oscillators are operated class A; therefore, the 
positive and negative signals applied to the base of Q1 will not cause it to go into saturation or cutoff. 
When the tank circuit reaches its maximum negative value, the collector and the emitter currents will still 
be present but at a minimum value. The magnetic field will have collapsed and the oscillator will have 
completed 3/4 cycle.
