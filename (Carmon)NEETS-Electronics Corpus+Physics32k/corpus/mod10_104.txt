Sounds may be broadly classified into two general groups. One group is NOISE, which includes
sounds such as the pounding of a hammer or the slamming of a door. The other group is musical sounds,
or TONES. The distinction between noise and tone is based on the regularity of the vibrations, the degree
of damping, and the ability of the ear to recognize components having a musical sequence. You can best
understand the physical difference between these kinds of sound by comparing the waveshape of a
musical note, depicted in view A of figure 1-13, with the waveshape of noise, shown in view B. You can
see by the comparison of the two waveshapes, that noise makes a very irregular and haphazard curve and
a musical note makes a uniform and regular curve.
