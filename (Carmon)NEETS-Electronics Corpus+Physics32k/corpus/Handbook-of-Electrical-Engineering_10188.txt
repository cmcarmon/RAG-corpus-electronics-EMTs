A choice of a robot for a selected application can be a very difÔ¨Åcult decision. Vendor information, expert
opinion,  and  various  sources  such  as  the  Robotics  Product  Database  [Flora,  1989]  can  aid  in  the  selection.
Selection  needs  to  consider  the  appropriate  combination  of  parameters  suitable  for  the  application.  These
parameters or technical features include the degrees of freedom, the type of drive and control system, sensory
capability, programming features, accuracy and precision requirements, and load capacity of the selected robot.
Various point or weighing schemes can be applied to rate different robot models.
