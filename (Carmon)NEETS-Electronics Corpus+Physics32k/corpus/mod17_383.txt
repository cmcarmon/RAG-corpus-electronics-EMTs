If the desired tty equipment is wired in the same looping channel as the radio adapter used, no 
patching is required. But, if the desired tty is not wired in the same looping channel as the keyer or 
converter, it must be patched. For example, let's put a tty on channel 1 and a converter on channel 3. If 
you want to receive, you must insert one end of the patch cord in the set jack for channel 1 and the other 
end in either one of the two looping jacks of channel 3.
