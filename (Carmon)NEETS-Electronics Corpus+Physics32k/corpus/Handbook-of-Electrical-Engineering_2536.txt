The reverse-biased junction that exists from b9 to the collector ensures that the associated dynamic resistance
rb9c will be very large indeed, which is fortunate, otherwise signal feedback from the output to the input would
modify the gain characteristics of the ampliﬁer. Typically, rb¢c will be some tens of megohms.
