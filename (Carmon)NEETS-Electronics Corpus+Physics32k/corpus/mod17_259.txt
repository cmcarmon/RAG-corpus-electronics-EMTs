The tone of the sound reproduced in the audio section of a receiver depends on several factors. The
frequency response of the audio amplifiers determines the degree of amplification provided to different
frequencies in the sound spectrum. The size and quality of any loudspeaker used will determine its
response to various frequencies. Response of the human ear is the final judge of tonal quality, and that
varies with the individual.
