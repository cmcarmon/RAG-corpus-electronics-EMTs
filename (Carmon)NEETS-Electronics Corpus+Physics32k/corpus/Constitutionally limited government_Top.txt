A constitutionally limited government is a system of government that is bound to certain principles of action by a state constitution. This system of government is dialectically opposed to pragmatism, on the basis that no state action can be made that conflicts with its constitution, regardless of the action's possible consequences.
An example of a constitutionally limited government is the United States, which is a constitutionally limited republic.
Inherent in any constitutionally limited government, is an accepted code of values, used to define its constitutional view of justice, making it a value social system.
