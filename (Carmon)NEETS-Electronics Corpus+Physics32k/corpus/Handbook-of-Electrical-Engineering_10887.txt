Scalability
This simply means that account should always be taken of the limitations of numerical algorithms. The package
should warn the user when limits are reached and the algorithms should thereafter ‘degrade gracefully’. It is
surprising how many applications have been programmed with artiﬁcial limits set on various arrays which is
ﬁne so long as the user never presents the package with a problem that its designer never believed would ever
be tackled (an inevitable event). Most matrix environments are limited only by the available memory.
