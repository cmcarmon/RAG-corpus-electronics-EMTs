The "theorem" is given as a restatement of the consequences of the first, second, and third laws of thermodynamics, with regard to the usable energy of a closed system:
You can't win. (consequence of first law of thermodynamics)
You can't break even. (consequence of second law of thermodynamics)
You can't even get out of the game. (consequence of third law of thermodynamics)
It is sometimes stated as a general adage without specific reference to the laws of thermodynamics.
