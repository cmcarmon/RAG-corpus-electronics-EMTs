Each component can be thought of as a ﬁxed-frequency sinusoid multiplied by a square wave of period
2T that alternates between one and zero. This baseband square wave has the same Fourier spectrum as
our BPSK example, but with the addition of the constant term c0. This quantity’s presence changes the
number of Fourier series terms required for the 90% bandwidth: Now we need only include the zero and ﬁrst
1
harmonics to achieve it. The bandwidth thus equals, with f0 < f1, f1 +
.
