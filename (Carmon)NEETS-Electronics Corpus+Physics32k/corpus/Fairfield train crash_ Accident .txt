At 18:01 local time (22:01 UTC), a Metro-North Railroad passenger train from Grand Central Terminal, New York City to Union Station, New Haven, Connecticut derailed between the Fairfield Metro and Bridgeport stations. The derailed train, 8 cars, came to rest foul of the track used by trains traveling in the opposite direction and was hit by a train traveling on that track. The engineer of the second train applied emergency brakes and was able to slow from 70 mph to 23 mph before the collision occurred. Both of the involved trains consisted of Kawasaki M8 railcars, which first entered service in 2011 and were still being delivered at the time of the accident. There were about 250 people on each of the two trains. The crash blocked both tracks in use – two others were out of service for maintenance – resulting in Amtrak canceling its Northeast Corridor service between New York and Boston, Massachusetts. This was the first major accident on any of the MTA commuter rail systems in more than a decade, and it is also the first involving the M8 railcars.
