The central force F that varies in strength as the inverse square of the distance r between them:





F

=


k

r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {k}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} }

where k is a constant and






r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
represents the unit vector along the line between them. The force may be either attractive (k<0) or repulsive (k>0). The corresponding scalar potential (the potential energy of the non-central body) is:
