So long as the ratio between RM and RN is equal to the ratio between Rm and Rn, the
balance equation is no more complex than that of a regular Wheatstone bridge, with Rx/Ra
equal to RN /RM , because the last term in the equation will be zero, canceling the effects of all
resistances except Rx, Ra, RM , and RN .
