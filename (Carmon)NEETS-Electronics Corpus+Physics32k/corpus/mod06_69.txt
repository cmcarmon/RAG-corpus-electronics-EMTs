As you know, it is impossible to have a voltage at one point, because voltage is defined as a
DIFFERENCE of POTENTIAL between two points. In our explanation above we referred to plate
voltage. To be exactly right, we should refer to plate voltage as the VOLTAGE BETWEEN PLATE
and FILAMENT. Plate voltages, and others that you will learn about soon, are often referred to as if they
appear at one point. This should not confuse you if you remember your definition of voltage and realize
that voltage is always measured between two points. M1 and M2 in figure 1-5 measure plate voltage and
filament voltage, respectively.
