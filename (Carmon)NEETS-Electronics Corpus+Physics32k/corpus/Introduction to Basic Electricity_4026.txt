must be tuned to the crystal frequency or the oscillator 
will not work. The advantage of the Butler oscillator 
is that a small voltage exists across the crystal, reduc-
ing stress on the crystal. By replacing the tank-circuit 
components, the oscillator can be tuned to operate on 
one of the crystalâ€™s overtone frequencies.
