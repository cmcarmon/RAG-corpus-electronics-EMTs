OGLE-2003-BLG-235L/MOA-2003-BLG-53L is the designation given to the star in the lens system. In 2004, analysis of the light curve produced as it passed in front of the source star allowed detection of an exoplanet orbiting the star with a mass 0.0039 times that of the host star (this would put it in the jovian mass range). The star was originally assumed to be a red dwarf star, since they are the most common type of star in the galaxy.
By 2006, the source and lens star had moved far enough apart (as viewed from Earth) that their light could be separated. Observations by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed that in fact the lens star was actually brighter and less red than expected, matching the expected spectra for a K dwarf of about 0.63 solar masses, more massive than the average star in the galaxy. This enables an estimate of the distance to the lens star, which puts it at around 5.8 kiloparsecs (19,000 light years) away.
