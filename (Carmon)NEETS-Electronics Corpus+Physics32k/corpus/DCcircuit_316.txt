With the disconnect switch in the ”open” position as shown (no continuity), the circuit is
broken and no current will exist. There will be zero voltage across the load, and the full voltage
of the source will be dropped across the open contacts of the disconnect switch. Note how there
is no need for a disconnect switch in the lower conductor of the circuit. Because that side of
the circuit is ﬁrmly connected to the earth (ground), it is electrically common with the earth
and is best left that way. For maximum safety of personnel working on the load of this circuit,
a temporary ground connection could be established on the top side of the load, to ensure that
no voltage could ever be dropped across the load:
