With a high-frequency generator (a transmitter) connected to the antenna, the induction field is 
produced as described in the previous section. However, the generator potential reverses before the 
electrostatic field has had time to collapse completely. The reversed generator potential neutralizes the 
remaining antenna charges, leaving a resultant E field in space.
