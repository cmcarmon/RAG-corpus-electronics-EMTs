. Lobe switching: In the lobe switching mode, the antenna
beam is switched alternately between two positions. The
difference in amplitude between the voltages obtained
in the two positions is a measure of the angular displace-
ment of the target from the switching axis. The sign of
the difference determines the direction that the antenna
must be moved. When the switching axis is in the direc-
tion of the target, the voltages in the two positions are
equal. Another two additional positions can be used to
determine the direction of the target in the orthogonal
plane.
