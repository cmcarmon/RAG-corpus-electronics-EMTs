be employed to use this frequency-to-voltage relationship to operate an indicator. The block diagram in  
view (A) of figure 4-44 represents one simple circuit which may be used to perform this function. In this 
circuit, the basic counter is fed into a low-pass filter and an amplifier with a meter that is calibrated in 
units of frequency.
