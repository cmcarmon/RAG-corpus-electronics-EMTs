The coupling capacitor, C2, has charged to approximately the same voltage as C1. As C1 discharges, 
C2 discharges. The primary discharge path for C2 is through R2 (shown by the dashed arrow). As C2 
discharges, the voltage drop across R2 opposes the forward bias on Q1 and collector current begins to 
decrease. This is caused by the decreasing positive potential at the base of Q1.
