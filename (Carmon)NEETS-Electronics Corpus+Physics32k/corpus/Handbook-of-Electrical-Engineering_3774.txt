If g < 1/8, specular reﬂection is dominant; if g > 1/8, diffuse scattering results. This criterion, known as Rayleigh
criterion, should only be used as a guideline since the dividing line between a specular and diffuse reﬂection
or between a smooth and a rough surface is not well deﬁned [Beckman and Spizzichino, 1963]. The roughness
is  taken  into  account  by  the  roughness  coefﬁcient  (0  < rs  <  1),  which  is  the  ratio  of  the  ﬁeld  strength  after
reﬂection with roughness taken into account to that which would be received if the surface were smooth. The
roughness coefﬁcient is given by
