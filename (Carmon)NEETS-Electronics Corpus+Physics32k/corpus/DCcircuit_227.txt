To invoke SPICE (tell it to process the contents of the circuit1.cir netlist ﬁle), we have
to exit from the text editor and access a command prompt (the ”DOS prompt” for Microsoft
users) where we can enter text commands for the computer’s operating system to obey. This
”primitive” way of invoking a program may seem archaic to computer users accustomed to a
”point-and-click” graphical environment, but it is a very powerful and ﬂexible way of doing
things. Remember, what you’re doing here by using SPICE is a simple form of computer pro-
gramming, and the more comfortable you become in giving the computer text-form commands
to follow – as opposed to simply clicking on icon images using a mouse – the more mastery you
will have over your computer.
