s o u r c e As another example of node analysis applied to a circuit with a floating
independent voltage source, consider the circuit shown in Figure 3.22. In this circuit, the
voltage source having value V3 is the only floating independent voltage source. Because
the source having value V1 is connected to ground at Node 5 it is not a floating source,
hence Node 1 is labeled with the node voltage V1. Similarly, the source having value V2
is not a floating source because it is connected to ground through the known voltage
V1, hence Node 2 is labeled with the known node voltage V1 + V2. Thus, only the
voltages at Nodes 3 and 4 in the super node are unknown. In Figure 3.22, Node 3 is
labeled with the unknown node voltage e, and so Node 4 is labeled with the node voltage
e + V3.
