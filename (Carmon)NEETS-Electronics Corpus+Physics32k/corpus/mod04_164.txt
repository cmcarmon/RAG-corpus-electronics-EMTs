Overheating small or delicate wiring can easily occur when a soldering gun is used. For most jobs, 
even the LOW position of the trigger overheats the gun after 10 seconds. With practice, the heat can be 
controlled by pulsing the gun on and off with its trigger. The HIGH position is used only for fast heating 
and for soldering heavy connections.
