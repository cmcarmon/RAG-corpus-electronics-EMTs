The compass and conducting wire meter can be considered a fixed-conductor moving-magnet device
since the compass is, in reality, a magnet that is allowed to move. The basic principle of this device is the
interaction of magnetic fields-the field of the compass (a permanent magnet) and the field around the
conductor (a simple electromagnet).
