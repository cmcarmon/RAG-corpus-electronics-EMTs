The timing functions are performed by counting the output cycles of a timing oscillator,
which generates a square wave with a precise period of 0.1 s. The digital signals produced by the
counter are passed on to a digital comparator, which compares them with signals from a reference
count generator and decides when the pulse generator is to deliver an output pulse of a speciÔ¨Åed
amplitude and duration.
