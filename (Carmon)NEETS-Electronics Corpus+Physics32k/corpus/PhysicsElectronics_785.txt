Decoders (octal decoder) can also convert a 3-bit binary number to an output on one of
eight lines. Hexadecimal decoders are 4-line to 16-line devices. When the decoder is disabled
the outputs will be high. A decoder would normally be disabled while the address lines were
changing to avoid glitches on the output lines.
