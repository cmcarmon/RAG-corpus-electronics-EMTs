Elimination of undesired measurement errors beneﬁts from a systematic approach to identifying and solving
noise problems. Source, interconnect, and response elements of a measurement system can be treated individ-
ually. Some techniques, such as shielding, are applicable to all three. Various combinations of techniques should
be tried to achieve best results. There are many choices of grounding techniques that vary depending on whether
elements are ﬂoating or ground-referred, and based on bandwidth. In general, multiple ground connections
  should  be  avoided.  Difﬁcult  ground  loop  problems  may  require  isolation  or  other
that  create 
techniques to interrupt the ground connection between elements. Table 108.4 summarizes a checklist of noise
reduction techniques.
