In many practical applications of complex circuits, various combinations of direct, low-frequency, 
audio-frequency, and radio-frequency currents may exist. It is frequently necessary to have a means for 
separating these component currents at any desired point. An electrical device for accomplishing this 
separation is called a FILTER.
