generating resources on-line and to perform appropriate line-switching operations. The time to repair a failed
transmission  line  typically  varies  from  2  to  10  days,  depending  on  the  type  of  line  (overhead,  underground
cable in conduit, or pipe-type cable). The time required to replace a failed bulk-power-system transformer is
typically 30 days. As such, ratings of each transmission line or transformer may include normal, 2-h emergency,
2- to 10-day emergency, and in some cases 30-day emergency ratings.
