Thus,  the  power  spectral  density  of  a  discrete-time  process  is  periodic.  Such  a  process  can  be  obtained  by
sampling a continuous-time process at t = kT, *k* = 0 ﬁ ¥, and if the original continuous-time process is band-
limited with a two-sided bandwidth equal to 2wb = 2p/T, then the set of discrete samples so obtained is equivalent
to the original process in a mean-square sense.
