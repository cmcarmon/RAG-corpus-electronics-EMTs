terms of router resources (e.g., buffer and bandwidth), in
terms of their priority relative to other PHBs, or in terms of
their relative trafﬁc properties (e.g., delay and loss). Multiple
PHBs can be lumped together to form a PHB group. A par-
ticular PHB group can be implemented in a variety of ways
because PHBs are deﬁned in terms of behavior characteristics
and are not implementation dependent. Thus PHBs can be
considered as basic building blocks for creating services. A
PHB for a packet is selected at the ﬁrst node on the basis of
its DS code point. The mapping from the DS code point to
PHB may be 1 to 1 or N to 1. Examples of the parameters of
the forwarding behavior that each trafﬁc should receive are
bandwidth partition and the drop priority. Examples of these
implementations are weighted fair queuing (WFQ) for band-
width partition and random early detect (RED) for drop
priority. Two commonly used PHBs deﬁned by IETF are the
following:
