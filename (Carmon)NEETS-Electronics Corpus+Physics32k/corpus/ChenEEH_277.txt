The impact of noise differs for analog and digital systems
and leads to unique equivalent circuit models and analytical
techniques. Analog noise is treated by linearized expressions
that correspond to small-signal equivalent circuit parameters.
Digital noise is analyzed by large-signal expressions that deÔ¨Åne
logic transitions. In this chapter, the characteristics of noise are
presented for both systems. Several examples are included for
each type of system.
