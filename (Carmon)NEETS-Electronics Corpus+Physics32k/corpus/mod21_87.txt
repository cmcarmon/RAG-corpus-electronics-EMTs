You have probably learned the hard way that some capacitors can retain a charge long after the
voltage has been removed. The electrical charge retained by capacitors in de-energized electronic circuits
is, in many cases, sufficient to cause a lethal shock. Be sure you and those working with you consider this
hazard before performing any type of maintenance on any electrical or electronic circuit and before
making connections to a seemingly dead circuit. Use extreme caution prior to working on or near de-
energized circuits that employ large capacitors. Be safeâ€”discharge and ground all high-voltage
capacitors and exposed high-voltage terminal leads by using only an authorized shorting probe, as shown
in figure 1-11. Repeat discharge operations several times to make sure that all high-voltage terminations
are completely discharged. It is of the utmost importance that you use only an authorized safety shorting
probe to discharge the circuits before performing any work on them. An authorized general-purpose
safety shorting probe for naval service application may be requisitioned using the current stock number
listed in the ELECTRONICS INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE BOOK (EIBM), General
NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0100, Section 3, Safety Equipment. Certain electronic equipment are provided
with built-in, special-purpose safety shorting probes. These probes are not considered general purpose.
Use them only with the equipment for which they are provided and only in a manner specified by the
technical manuals for the equipment. It is considered to be poor practice to remove them for use
elsewhere.
