The advantages of the double bus–double breaker scheme
include (a) two dedicated breakers in each circuit, (b) breakers
that can be taken out of service for maintenance, (c) high
reliability, and (d) ﬂexibility in allowing feeder circuits to be
connected to either bus. Its disadvantages include high cost
and the loss of half the circuits for breaker failure if circuits are
not connected to both busses.
