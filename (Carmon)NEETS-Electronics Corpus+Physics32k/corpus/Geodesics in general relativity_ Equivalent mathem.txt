So far the geodesic equation of motion has been written in terms of a scalar parameter s. It can alternatively be written in terms of the time coordinate,



t
≡

x

0




{\displaystyle t\equiv x^{0}}
(here we have used the triple bar to signify a definition). The geodesic equation of motion then becomes:

{\displaystyle {d^{2}x^{\mu } \over dt^{2}}=-\Gamma ^{\mu }{}_{\alpha \beta }{dx^{\alpha } \over dt}{dx^{\beta } \over dt}+\Gamma ^{0}{}_{\alpha \beta }{dx^{\alpha } \over dt}{dx^{\beta } \over dt}{dx^{\mu } \over dt}\ .}

This formulation of the geodesic equation of motion can be useful for computer calculations and to compare General Relativity with Newtonian Gravity. It is straightforward to derive this form of the geodesic equation of motion from the form which uses proper time as a parameter, using the chain rule. Notice that both sides of this last equation vanish when the mu index is set to zero. If the particle's velocity is small enough, then the geodesic equation reduces to this:

{\displaystyle {d^{2}x^{n} \over dt^{2}}=-\Gamma ^{n}{}_{00}.}

Here the Latin index n takes the values [1,2,3]. This equation simply means that all test particles at a particular place and time will have the same acceleration, which is a well-known feature of Newtonian gravity. For example, everything floating around in the international space station will undergo roughly the same acceleration due to gravity.
