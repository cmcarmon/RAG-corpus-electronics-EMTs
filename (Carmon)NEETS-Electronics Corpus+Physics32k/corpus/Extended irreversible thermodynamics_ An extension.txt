EIT can be viewed as the natural extension of Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics (CIT).
Mainly developed by the Belgian-Dutch school headed by I. Prigogine, working on a simple hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium, CIT assumes the existence of field laws of the diffusion type. Mathematically, these are parabolic partial differential equations. They entail that a locally applied disturbance propagates at infinite velocity across the body. This contradicts both experimental evidence and the principle of causality. The latter requires that an effect comes after the application of its cause.
In EIT, the idea of local thermodynamic equilibrium is abandoned. In contrast with CIT, the field equations of EIT are hyperbolic circumventing the paradox of signals moving at infinite velocity.
