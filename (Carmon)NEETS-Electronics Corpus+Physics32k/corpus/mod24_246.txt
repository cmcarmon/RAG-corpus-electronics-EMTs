Multimode step-index fibers have relatively large core diameters and large numerical apertures. A
large core size and a large numerical aperture make it easier to couple light from a light-emitting diode
(LED) into the fiber. Multimode step-index fiber core size is typically 50 m m or 100 m m. Unfortunately,
multimode step-index fibers have limited bandwidth capabilities. Dispersion, mainly modal dispersion,
limits the bandwidth or information-carrying capacity of the fiber. System designers consider each factor
when selecting an appropriate fiber for each particular application.
