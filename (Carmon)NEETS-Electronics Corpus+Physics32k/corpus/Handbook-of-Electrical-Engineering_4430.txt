Over the past two decades, microwave active circuits have evolved from individual solid state transistors and
passive elements housed in conventional waveguides and/or coaxial lines to fully integrated planar assemblies,
including active and passive components and interconnections, generically referred to as a microwave integrated
  (HMIC)  consists  of  an  interconnect  pattern  and
circuit  (MIC).  The 
distributed circuit components printed on a suitable substrate, with active and lumped circuit components (in
packaged or chip form) attached individually to the printed interconnect circuit by the use of soldering and
wire bonding techniques. The solid state active elements are either silicon or gallium arsenide (or other III–V
 (MMIC) approach
compound) devices. More recently, the solid state 
has  become  commonplace.  In  MMICs,  all  interconnections  and  components,  both  active  and  passive,  are
fabricated simultaneously on a semi-insulating semiconductor substrate (usually gallium arsenide, GaAs) using
deposition and etching processes, thereby eliminating discrete components and wire bond interconnects. The
term MMIC is used for circuits operating in the millimeter wave (30–300 GHz) region of the frequency spectrum
as  well  as  the  microwave  (1–30  GHz)  region.  Major  advantages  of  MMICs  include  low  cost,  small  size,  low
weight, circuit design ﬂexibility, broadband performance, elimination of circuit tweaking, high-volume man-
ufacturing capability, package simpliﬁcation, improved reproducibility, improved reliability, and multifunction
performance on a single chip.
