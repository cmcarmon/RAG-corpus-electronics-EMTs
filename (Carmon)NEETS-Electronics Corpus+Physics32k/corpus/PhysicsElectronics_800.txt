We ﬁrst consider the static clocked (level-sensitive) RS ﬂip-ﬂop shown in ﬁgure 7.20. The
symbol x in the following tables represents either the binary state 0 or 1.
The ﬁrst ﬁve lines in the truth table give the static input and output states. The last four
lines show the state of the outputs after a complete clock pulse p.
