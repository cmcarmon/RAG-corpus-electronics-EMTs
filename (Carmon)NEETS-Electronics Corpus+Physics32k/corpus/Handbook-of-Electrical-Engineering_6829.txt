There are several basic signal detection structures that can be derived from Eqs. (73.1) to (73.3) under the
assumption that the noise sequence consists of a set of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian
Thus,
random variables with zero means. Such a sequence is known as 
until further notice, we will make this assumption about the noise. It should be noted that this assumption is
physically justiÔ¨Åable in many applications.
