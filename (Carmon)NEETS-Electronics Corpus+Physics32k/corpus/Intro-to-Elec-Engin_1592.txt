MOS-controlled thyristors (MCT) are rated for 3 kV, capable of interrupting around 300 A with
a recovery time of 5 Âµs. Gate turn-off (GTO) thyristors can control 1 to 3 kA with a blocking
voltage capability of 6 to 8 kV. Table 16.1.3 gives the symbols and the v-i characteristics of the
commonly used power semiconductor devices.
