The charge ﬂow through the sample is due to the rearrangement of the polarization vectors in the domains
(the polarization) and contributions from the static capacity and losses (Co and Rd in Fig. 49.3). The charge is
integrated by the measuring capacitor which is in series with the sample. The measuring capacitor is sufﬁciently
large to avoid a signiﬁcant voltage loss. The polarization is plotted on a X-Y scope or plotter against the applied
voltage and therefore the applied ﬁeld.
