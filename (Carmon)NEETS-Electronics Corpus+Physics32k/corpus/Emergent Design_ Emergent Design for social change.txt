Emergent Design is also being used in social change movements, such as a group of Canadian NGOs that are bringing together a group of civic leaders to discuss how their work scales up and scales deep. A series of events are being organized by the Carold Institute and Ashoka Canada in 2013 through to 2015. The project goals currently include, but are not limited to:
Engage emerging leaders in redefining models and systems that will support a vibrant and dynamic civil society in Canada.
Strengthen and broaden the impact of their leadership
Discover and disseminate new knowledge related to systems change and emerging systems
Share key learning, insights, innovative strategies and new models of engagement among participants and with key stakeholders and sponsoring organizations
