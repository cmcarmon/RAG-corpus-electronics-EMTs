Other forms of astable oscillator 
 
the  circuit  diagram  of  an 
Figure  9.9  shows 
form  of  astable  oscillator  which 
alternative 
produces 
a 
output  waveform. 
Operational  amplifier  IC1  forms  an  integrating 
stage  while  IC2 
is  connected  with  positive 
feedback to ensure that oscillation takes place. 
  Assume  that  the  output  from  IC2  is  initially  at, 
or near, +VCC and capacitor, C, is  uncharged. The 
voltage at the output of IC2 will be passed, via R,
to  IC1.  Capacitor,  C, will  start  to  charge  and  the 
output voltage of IC1 will begin to fall.
