establish contact with the electrolyte (the salt, acid, or 
alkaline solution) and the circuit. The electrolyte pulls 
the free electrons from the copper electrode, leaving it 
with a positive charge. The zinc electrode attracts free 
electrons in the electrolyte and thus acquires a nega-
tive charge. Several of these cells can be connected 
together to form a battery. Figure 12-4 shows the sche-
matic symbol for a cell and battery. Many types of cells 
and batteries are in use today (Figure 12-5).
