Unit  commitment  calculates  the  necessary  generating  units  that  should  be  connected  (committed)  at  any
time  in  order  to  supply  the  demand  and  losses  plus  allow  sufﬁcient  reserve  capability  to  withstand  a  load
increase or accidental loss of a generating unit. Several operating restrictions must be taken into account when
determining which machines to commit or decommit. These include maximum and minimum running times
for  a  unit  and  the  time  needed  to  commit  a  unit.  Fuel  availability  constraints  must  also  be  considered.  For
example, there may be limited fuel reserves such as coal stocks or water in the dam. Other fuel constraints may
be minimum water ﬂows below the dam or agreements to purchase minimum amounts of fuel. Determining
unit commitment for a speciﬁc time cannot be evaluated without consideration of the past operational con-
ﬁguration or the future operating demands.
