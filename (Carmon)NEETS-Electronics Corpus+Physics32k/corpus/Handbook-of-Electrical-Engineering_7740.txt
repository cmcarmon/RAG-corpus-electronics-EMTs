Further, unlike conventional devices, a transfer between memory and expanded storage is performed syn-
chronously with the CPU. This is viewed as acceptable, because the transfer requires so little time and does not
involve the usual operating system overheads of I/O set-up and interrupts. Note that to transfer data from ES
to disk requires the data to be Ô¨Årst staged into main memory.
