A circle-throw vibrating screen with a shaft and bearing system requires consideration of the loading the unit will undergo. The extra loading to the screen box created by the centrifugal force, due to the circular motion of the load as it passes through the unit is also a factor. Bearings must be designed to accommodate the extra stress. Bearing load due to screen box centrifugal force (Fr) is
