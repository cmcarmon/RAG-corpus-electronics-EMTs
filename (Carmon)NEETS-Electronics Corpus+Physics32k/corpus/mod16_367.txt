Notice that the zero point on the ohmmeter scale (as opposed to the zero points for voltage and
current) is located at the extreme right side of the scale. With the test leads shorted, the zero-adjust
potentiometer is set so that the pointer rests on the zero mark. Therefore, a full-scale deflection indicates
zero resistance between the leads.
