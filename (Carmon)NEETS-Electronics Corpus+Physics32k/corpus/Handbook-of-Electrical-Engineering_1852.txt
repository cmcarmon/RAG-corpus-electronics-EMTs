Linear arrays are subject to the limitation that the source is required to be located on the extended line of
sensors so that plane wavefronts approaching the array site at a particular velocity excite the individual sensors,
assumed equispaced, at arrival times which are also equispaced. In seismology, the equispaced interval between
successive sensor arrival times is called a move-out or step-out and equals (D sin u)/v = D/V. However, when
the sensor-to-source azimuth varies, two or more independent signal move-outs may be present. Planar (2-D)
arrays  are  then  required  to  discriminate  between  velocities  as  well  as  azimuth.  Spatial  (3-D)  arrays  provide
additional scope to the enhancement of discriminating capabilities when sensor/source locations are arbitrary.
In such cases, an array origin is chosen and the mth sensor location is denoted by a vector (x1m x2m x3m)t and
the frequency wavenumber response of an array of sensors is given by
