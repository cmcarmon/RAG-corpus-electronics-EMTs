Induction Motor Analysis
The  characteristic  algebraic  equations  for  the  steady-state  power,  torque,  and  efﬁciency  of  the  ac  induction
motor are derived from the per-phase equivalent circuit of Fig. 66.16. All voltages and currents are in sinusoidal
steady state. The derivation of the equations can be simpliﬁed by deﬁning the complex motor impedance as
