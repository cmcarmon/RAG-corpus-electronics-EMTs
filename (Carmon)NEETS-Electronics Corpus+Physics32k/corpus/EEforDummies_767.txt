Hundreds of microcontrollers are avail-
able, but a handful are geared specifically 
for first‐timers. Some, such as the one 
shown on the PCB in Figure 11-22, can be 
purchased as part of a complete develop-
ment package: You get a pre‐assembled 
printed circuit board populated with the 
microcontroller IC, discrete components, 
and standard connectors so that you can 
connect the microcontroller to a circuit 
during operation or to your computer 
for programming. Many of these kits 
also include an integrated development 
environment (IDE), which contains soft-
ware tools for programming the micro-
controller. (See Chapter 18 for more on 
micro controller kits.)
