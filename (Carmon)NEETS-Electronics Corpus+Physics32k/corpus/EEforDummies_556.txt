Conducting current through a diode
After current starts flowing through a diode, the forward voltage drop across 
the diode remains fairly constant — even if you increase the forward current. 
For instance, most silicon diodes have a forward voltage of between 0.6 V 
and 0.7 V over a wide range of forward currents. If you’re analyzing a circuit 
that contains a silicon diode (such as the circuit on the left in Figure 9­5),  
you can assume that the voltage drop across the diode is about 0.7 V — even 
if you increase the source voltage from 6 V to 9 V. Increasing the source 
 voltage increases the current through the circuit, but the diode voltage  
drop remains the same, so the increased source voltage is dropped across 
the lamp.
