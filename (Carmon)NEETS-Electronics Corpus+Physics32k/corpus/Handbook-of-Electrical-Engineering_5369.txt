Amorphous silicon-based solar cells and modules have
serious  problems  with  several  stability  mechanisms.  The
stabilized efﬁciencies of research solar cells are about 33%
less  than  other  thin-ﬁlm  options  (i.e.,  12%  vs.  18%).
Although  solar  cell  and  module  engineering  have  mini-
mized  the  Staebler-Wronski  effect,  the  stability  issue
remains a major research, manufacturing, and consumer
acceptance issue. Module design has requirements beyond
those for crystalline Si and the ingress of any environmental
entity has major inﬂuence because of the large surface-to-
volume ratios involved. Stability and reliability of a device
is  the  major  issue  relating  to  amorphous  Si  technology.
