Since the amplitude of the rotating ﬁelds is one-half of the alternating ﬂux, as seen from Equation
(12.3.10), the total magnetizing and leakage reactances of the motor can be divided equally so
as to correspond to the forward and backward rotating ﬁelds. In the equivalent circuit shown in
Figure 13.2.11(a), then, R1 and Xl1 are, respectively, the resistance and the leakage reactance of
(cid:7)
l2 are the standstill values of
the main winding, Xm is the magnetizing reactance, and R
the rotor resistance and the leakage reactance referred to the main stator winding by the use
of the appropriate turns ratio. The core loss, which is omitted here, can be accounted for later
as if it were a rotational loss. The resultant torque of a single-phase induction motor can thus be
expressed as
