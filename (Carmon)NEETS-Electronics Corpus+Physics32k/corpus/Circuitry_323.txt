typical  example, 
the  LM78S40.  This  device 
contains  two  operational  amplifiers  (IC1  and  IC2) 
designed to work as comparators, and a two-stage 
Darlington transistor switch comprising an emitter-
follower  driver,  Q1,  and  output  switch,  Q2.  The 
LM78S40 is supplied in a 16-pin dual-in-line (DIL) 
package. 
  The LM78S40 can be configured to provide step-
up 
inverting 
operation.  The  frequency  of  the  internal  current 
controlled oscillator is set by the value of capacitor 
connected  to  pin-12.  Oscillator  frequencies  of 
between 100 Hz and 100 kHz are possible but most 
practical  applications  operate  at 
frequencies 
between  20  kHz  and  50  kHz.  The  oscillator  duty 
cycle  is  internally  set  to  6:1  but  can  be  varied  by 
means of the current sensing circuit which normally 
senses the current in an external resistor connected 
between pins-12 and 13. 
reference 
  An 
provides a stable voltage reference of 1.3 V at pin-
8. The internal reference voltage source is capable 
of providing a current of up to 10 mA drawn from 
pin-8.  The  output  transistor,  Q2,  is  capable  of 
carrying  a  peak  current  of  up  to  1.5  A  and  has  a 
maximum collector-emitter voltage rating of 40 V. 
The 
is 
accessible  between  pins-1  and  2  and  this  has 
similar  ratings  to  Q2.  Both  D1  and  Q2  have 
switching times of between 300 and 500 ns. IC1 is 
used to compare the 1.3 V voltage reference (pin-
10  connected  to  pin-8)  with  a  proportion  of  the 
output (derived from a simple two-resistor potential 
divider).
