The following are categorized as being part of quantum mechanics:
Schr√∂dinger wave mechanics, used to describe the movements of the wavefunction of a single particle.
Matrix mechanics is an alternative formulation that allows considering systems with a finite-dimensional state space.
Quantum statistical mechanics generalizes ordinary quantum mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive thermodynamic properties.
Particle physics, the motion, structure, and reactions of particles
Nuclear physics, the motion, structure, and reactions of nuclei
Condensed matter physics, quantum gases, solids, liquids, etc.
