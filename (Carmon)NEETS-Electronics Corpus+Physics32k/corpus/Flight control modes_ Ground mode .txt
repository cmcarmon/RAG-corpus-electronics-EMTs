The aircraft behaves as in direct mode: the autotrim feature is turned off and there is a direct response of the elevators to the sidestick inputs. The horizontal stabilizer is set to 4° up but manual settings (e.g. for center of gravity) override this setting. After the wheels leave the ground, a 5-second transition occurs where normal law – flight mode takes over from ground mode.
