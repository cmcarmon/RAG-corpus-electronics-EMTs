Calculating the effect of weather on radio wave propagation would be comparatively simple if there 
were no water or water vapor in the atmosphere. However, some form of water (vapor, liquid, or solid) is 
always present and must be considered in all calculations. Before we begin discussing the specific effects 
that individual forms of precipitation (rain, snow, fog) have on radio waves, you should understand that 
attenuation because of precipitation is generally proportionate to the frequency and wavelength of the 
radio wave. For example, rain has a pronounced effect on waves at microwave frequencies. However, rain 
hardly affects waves with long wavelengths (hf range and below). You can assume, then, that as the 
wavelength becomes shorter with increases in frequency, precipitation has an increasingly important 
attenuation effect on radio waves. Conversely, you can assume that as the wavelength becomes longer 
with decreases in frequency, precipitation has little attenuation effect.
