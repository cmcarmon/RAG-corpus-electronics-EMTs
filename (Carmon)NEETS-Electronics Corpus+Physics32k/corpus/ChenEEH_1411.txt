The Trianus system (Gehring and Ludwig, 1996) is an inte-
grated tool set consisting of a layout editor, circuit checker,
technology mapper, placer, router, and bit-stream generator
and loader for the Xilinx 6200 FPGA. The back ends of the
Trianus tool set have been incorporated with the IRIS tools
(Woods et al., 1997), allowing designs to be changed at the
architectural level in IRIS rather than at the FPGA layout level.
Lysaght and his groups have developed a framework called
dynamic circuit switching for specifying, simulating, and de-
bugging reconﬁgurable designs (Lysaght, 1997; Lysaght and
Stockwood, 1996; McGregor et al., 1998; Robinson et al.,
1998). Their tools can estimate the reconﬁguration time be-
fore low-level tools are invoked; this information is used in
their compilation process to produce efﬁcient reconﬁgurable
designs.
