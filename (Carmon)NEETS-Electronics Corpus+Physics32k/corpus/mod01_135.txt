A pattern of this directional force can be obtained by performing an experiment with iron filings. A
piece of glass is placed over a bar magnet and the iron filings are then sprinkled on the surface of the
glass. The magnetizing force of the magnet will be felt through the glass and each iron filing becomes a
temporary magnet. If the glass is now tapped gently, the iron particles will align themselves with the
magnetic field surrounding the magnet just as the compass needle did previously. The filings form a
definite pattern, which is a visible representation of the forces comprising the magnetic field. Examination
of the arrangements of iron filings in figure 1-13 will indicate that the magnetic field is very strong at the
poles and weakens as the distance from the poles increases. It is also apparent that the magnetic field
extends from one pole to the other, constituting a loop about the magnet.
