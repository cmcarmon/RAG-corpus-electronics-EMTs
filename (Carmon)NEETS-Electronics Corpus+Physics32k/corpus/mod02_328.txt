POWER FACTOR CORRECTIONâ€”To reduce losses in a circuit the power factor should be as 
close to unity or 100% as possible. This is done by adding capacitive reactance to a circuit when the total 
reactance is inductive. If the total reactance is capacitive, inductive reactance is added in the circuit.
