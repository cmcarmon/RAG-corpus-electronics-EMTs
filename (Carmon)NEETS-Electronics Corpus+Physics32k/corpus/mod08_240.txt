In this circuit, the secondary of T1 and capacitor C1 form a tuned circuit which is the input-signal-
developing impedance. The primary of T2 and capacitor C2 are a tuned circuit which acts as the output
impedance of Q1. (Both T1 and T2 must be rf transformers in order to operate at rf frequencies.)
