We will learn that ﬁnding a linear, time-invariant system’s output in the time domain can be most easily
calculated by determining the input signal’s spectrum, performing a simple calculation in the frequency
domain, and inverse transforming the result. Furthermore, understanding communications and information
processing systems requires a thorough understanding of signal structure and of how systems work in both
the time and frequency domains.
