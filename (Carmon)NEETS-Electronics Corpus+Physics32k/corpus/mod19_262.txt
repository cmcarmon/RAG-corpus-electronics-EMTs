A corrosive atmosphere can damage unprotected electric and electronic equipment. You should be 
aware of the harmful effects of moisture and, in particular, salt spray and salt-impregnated air. To prevent 
corrosion, you should maintain an effective cleaning and lubricating schedule. Standard preventive 
maintenance (PMS) procedures provide only minimum protection. Any schedule should include dusting 
and cleaning, lubrication of moving parts, and the use of approved solvents or wetting agents to remove 
any dust, dirt, oil film, salt, or other contaminant.
