Circuit Switching
A connection between the calling station and the called station
is established on demand for exclusive use of the physical
connection. Three phases of a circuit switching connection
exist; (1) connection establishment phase requires a separate
setup signal to send and the acknowledgement signal to re-
ceive; (2) The data transfer phase has no interruption to the
data transfer; and (3) the termination phase allows the release
of the resource so that other connection, can use the resource.
The switching technique does not require buffers or queues
and is free of congestion. Long setup time may cause undesir-
able delay, which is rather inefﬁcient if no data are being
transferred. Appropriate applications may have relatively con-
tinuous ﬂow, such as voice, sensor, and telemetry inputs.
