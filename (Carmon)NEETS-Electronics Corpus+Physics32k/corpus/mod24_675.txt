Fiber optic transmitters using LDs require more complex circuitry than transmitters using LEDs. The
basic requirement for digital systems is for drive circuitry to switch the optical output on and off at high
speeds in response to logic voltage levels at the input of the source drive circuit. Because LDs are
threshold devices, LDs are supplied with a bias just below the threshold in the off state. This bias is often
referred to as prebias. One reason for prebiasing the LD is to reduce the turn-on delay in digital systems.
