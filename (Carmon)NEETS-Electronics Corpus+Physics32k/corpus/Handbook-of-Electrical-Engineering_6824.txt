 problems are concerned
primarily with situations in which the information to be extracted from a signal is discrete in nature. That is,
signal detection procedures are techniques for deciding among a discrete (usually Ô¨Ånite) number of possible
alternatives. An example of such a problem is the demodulation of a digital communication signal, in which
the task of interest is to decide which of several possible transmitted symbols has elicited a given received signal.
Estimation
 problems, on the other hand, deal with the determination of some numerical quantity taking values
in a continuum. An example of an estimation problem is that of determining the phase or frequency of the
carrier underlying a communication signal.
