Given a segment of a curve, another frequently defined quantity is the (kinetic) energy of the curve:

{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\int _{a}^{b}\sum _{i,j=1}^{n}g_{ij}(\gamma (t))\left({\frac {d}{dt}}x^{i}\circ \gamma (t)\right)\left({\frac {d}{dt}}x^{j}\circ \gamma (t)\right)\,dt\,.}

This usage comes from physics, specifically, classical mechanics, where the integral E can be seen to directly correspond to the kinetic energy of a point particle moving on the surface of a manifold. Thus, for example, in Jacobi's formulation of Maupertuis' principle, the metric tensor can be seen to correspond to the mass tensor of a moving particle.
In many cases, whenever a calculation calls for the length to be used, a similar calculation using the energy may be done as well. This often leads to simpler formulas by avoiding the need for the square-root. Thus, for example, the geodesic equations may be obtained by applying variational principles to either the length or the energy. In the latter case, the geodesic equations are seen to arise from the principle of least action: they describe the motion of a "free particle" (a particle feeling no forces) that is confined to move on the manifold, but otherwise moves freely, with constant momentum, within the manifold.
