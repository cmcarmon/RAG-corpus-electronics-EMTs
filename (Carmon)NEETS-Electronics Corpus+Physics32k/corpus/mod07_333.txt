An older device that uses light in a way similar to the photodiode is the photoconductive cell, or 
PHOTOCELL, shown with its schematic symbol in figure 3-34. Like the photodiode, the photocell is a 
light-controlled variable resistor. However, a typical light-to-dark resistance ratio for a photocell is 
1:1000. This means that its resistance could range from 1000 ohms in the light to 1000 kilohms in the 
dark, or from 2000 ohms in the light to 2000 kilohms in the dark, and so forth. Of course, other ratios are 
also available. Photocells are used in various types of control and timing circuits as, for example, the 
automatic street light controllers in most cities.
