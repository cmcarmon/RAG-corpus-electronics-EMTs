Most computers simply stop running when they break. We take this as a given. There are many environments,
however,  where  it  is  not  acceptable  for  the  computer  to  stop  working.  The  space  shuttle  is  a  good  example.
There are other environments where you would simply prefer if the system continued to operate. A business
using a computer for order entry can continue to operate if the computer breaks, but the cost and inconvenience
may be high. Fault-tolerant systems are composed of specially designed hardware and software that are capable
of continuous operation.
