Figure  7.4  shows  the  effect  of  moving  the  bias 
point  down  the  transfer  characteristic  and,  at  the 
same  time,  increasing  the  amplitude  of  the  input 
signal.  From  this,  you  should  notice  that  the 
extreme  negative  portion  of  the  output  signal  has 
become distorted. This effect arises  from the non-
linearity  of  the  transfer  characteristic  that  occurs 
near  the  origin  (i.e.  the  zero  point).  Despite  the 
obvious  non-linearity  in  the  output  waveform,  the 
active  device(s)  will  conduct  current  during  a 
complete cycle of the signal waveform. 
  Now consider the case of reducing the bias even 
further while further increasing the amplitude of the 
input signal (see Fig. 7.5). Here the bias point has 
been set at the projected cut-off point. The negative 
portion  of  the  output  signal  becomes  cut  off  (or 
clipped) and  the  active  device(s)  will  cease  to 
conduct  for  this  part  of  the  cycle.  This  mode  of 
operation is known as Class AB.
