Electrons  are  caused  to  flow  from  an  NPN 
 transistor emitter by a forward bias. Forward bias is 
a positive voltage on the base terminal with respect 
to the  emitter terminal. A positive potential attracts 
 electrons, creating an electron flow from the  emitter. 
The electrons that are attracted into the base are now 
influenced by the positive potential applied to the 
 collector. The majority of electrons are attracted to 
the collector and into the positive side of the reverse- 
biased voltage source. A few electrons are absorbed 
into the base region and support a small electron flow 
from it. For this action to occur, the base region must 
be extremely thin. In a properly biased PNP transistor, 
the batteries must be reversed (Figure 31-6).
