When pinch-off occurs, the voltage at the pinch-off point is
pinned at VP even when the channel length is continually
reduced at higher drain biases. In long channel MESFETs, the
length of the pinch-off region is negligibly small and can be
ignored. This results in saturation of the drain current for
voltages beyond VP. In smaller devices, however, the length
and the resistance of the channel decreases as the pinch-off
region becomes wider. Similar to channel length modulation
in MOSFETs, this results in a gradual increase in drain current
with applied drain bias.
