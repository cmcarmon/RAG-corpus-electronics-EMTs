At any instant, the algebraic sum of the voltages (v) around a
loop is equal to zero. In going around a loop, a useful conven-
tion is to take the voltage drop (going from positive to nega-
tive) as positive and the voltage rise (going from negative to
positive) as negative. In Figure 1.2, application of KVL around
the loop ABCEA gives the following equation:
vAB þ vBC þ vCE þ vEA ¼ 0:
