Conversely, if l > j, the surface energy associated with the boundary is negative and lowers the total system
energy. It is therefore thermodynamically favorable for a normal–superconducting interface to form inside these
type II materials. Consequently, this class of superconductors does not exhibit the simple Meissner effect as do
type I materials. Instead, there are now two critical ﬁelds: for applied ﬁelds below the lower critical ﬁeld, Hc1,
a type II superconductor is in the Meissner state, and for applied ﬁelds greater than the upper critical ﬁeld,
Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. The three critical ﬁeld are related to each other by Hc »
