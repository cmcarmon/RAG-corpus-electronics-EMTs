In figure 2-32, observe the relative time for individual rf cycles. The time for each cycle is the same
in views (A) and (B). Since this time is the same, we can assume that the carrier frequency is the same.
But in view (C) the time for each cycle is about half that in views (A) and (B). Therefore, the frequency
of the carrier in view (C) is nearly twice that of the other two. This illustration shows that carrier
frequencies in pulse systems can vary.
