A variety of standard and proprietary interfaces are deﬁned for transferring the data recorded on the disk
to or from the host. We concentrate on industry standards here. On the disk surface, information is represented
as  alternating  polarities  of  magnetic  ﬁelds.  These  signals  need  to  be  sensed,  ampliﬁed,  and  decoded  into
synchronized pulses by the read electronics. For example, the pulse-level protocol ST506/412 standard describes
the way pulses can be extracted from the alternating ﬂux ﬁelds. The bit-level ESDI, SMD, and IPI-2 standards
describe the bit encoding of signals. At the packet level, these bits must be aligned into bytes, error correcting
codes need to be applied, and the extracted data must be delivered to the host. These “intelligent” standards
include SCSI (small computer standard interface) and IPI-3.
