Like electric charges, there were only two types of poles to be found: north and south (by
analogy, positive and negative). Just as with electric charges, same poles repel one another,
while opposite poles attract. This force, like that caused by static electricity, extended itself
invisibly over space, and could even pass through objects such as paper and wood with little
effect upon strength.
