Here, A and B are experimentally determined constants, different for each type of impurity (x, +, –, =). B
is the activation energy for the process. This expression derives from the Maxwellian distribution of particle
energies and will be seen many times in process simulation. It is easily seen that the diffusion process is strongly
inﬂuenced by temperature. The term FIV is an enhancement factor which is dependent on the concentration
of interstitials and vacancies within the crystal lattice (an interstitial is an extra silicon atom which is not located
on a regular lattice site; a vacancy is a missing silicon atom which results in an empty lattice site) FIV (cid:181) CI +
Cv .  The  concentration  of  vacancies,  Cv ,  and  interstitials,  CI ,  are  in  turn  determined  by  their  own  diffusion
