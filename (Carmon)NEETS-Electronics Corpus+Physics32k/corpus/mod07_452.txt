The inductor (also referred to as the filter choke or coil) serves to maintain the current flow to the 
filter output (RL) at a nearly constant level during the charge and discharge periods of the filter capacitor. 
The inductor (L1) and the capacitor (C1) form a voltage divider for the ac component (ripple) of the 
applied input voltage. This is shown in views A and B of figure 4-21. As far as the ripple component is 
concerned, the inductor offers a high impedance (Z) and the capacitor offers a low impedance (view B). 
As a result, the ripple component (Er) appearing across the load resistance is greatly attenuated (reduced). 
The inductance of the filter choke opposes changes in the value of the current flowing through it;
