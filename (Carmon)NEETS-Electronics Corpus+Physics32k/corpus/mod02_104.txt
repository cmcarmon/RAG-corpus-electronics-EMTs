 During the second time constant, current again increases by 63.2% (.632) of the difference in value 
between the current flowing in the inductor and the maximum current. This difference is 10 amperes 
minus 6.32 amperes and equals 3.68 amperes; 63.2% of 3.68 amperes is 2.32 amperes. This increase in 
current during the second time constant is added to that of the first time constant. Thus, upon completion 
of the second time constant, the amount of current in the LR circuit is 6.32 amperes + 2.32 amperes = 
8.64 amperes.
