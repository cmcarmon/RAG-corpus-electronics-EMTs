As odd as it may seem, the actual mathematical relationship between pressure, ﬂow, and
resistance is actually more complex for ﬂuids like water than it is for electrons. If you pursue
further studies in physics, you will discover this for yourself. Thankfully for the electronics
student, the mathematics of Ohm’s Law is very straightforward and simple.
