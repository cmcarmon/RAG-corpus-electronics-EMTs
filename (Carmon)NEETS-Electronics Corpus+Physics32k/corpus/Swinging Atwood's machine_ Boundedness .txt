For any initial position, it can be shown that the swinging mass is bounded by a curve that is a conic section. The pivot is always a focus of this bounding curve. The equation for this curve can be derived by analyzing the energy of the system, and using conservation of energy. Let us suppose that



m


{\displaystyle m}
is released from rest at



r
=

r

0




{\displaystyle r=r_{0}}
and



θ
=

θ

0




{\displaystyle \theta =\theta _{0}}
. The total energy of the system is therefore:

However, notice that in the boundary case, the velocity of the swinging mass is zero. Hence we have:

To see that it is the equation of a conic section, we isolate for

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r&={\frac {h}{1-{\frac {\cos {\theta }}{\mu }}}}\\h&=r_{0}\left(1-{\frac {\cos {\theta _{0}}}{\mu }}\right)\end{aligned}}}

Note that the numerator is a constant dependent only on the initial position in this case, as we have assumed the initial condition to be at rest. However, the energy constant



h


{\displaystyle h}
can also be calculated for nonzero initial velocity, and the equation still holds in all cases. The eccentricity of the conic section is





1
μ




{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\mu }}}
. For



μ
>
1


{\displaystyle \mu >1}
, this is an ellipse, and the system is bounded and the swinging mass always stays within the ellipse. For



μ
=
1


{\displaystyle \mu =1}
, it is a parabola and for



μ
<
1


{\displaystyle \mu <1}
it is a hyperbola; in either of these cases, it is not bounded. As



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
gets arbitrarily large, the bounding curve approaches a circle. The region enclosed by the curve is known as the Hill's region.
