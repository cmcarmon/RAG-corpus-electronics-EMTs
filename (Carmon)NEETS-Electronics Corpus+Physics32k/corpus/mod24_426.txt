Passive fiber optic coupler fabrication techniques can be complex and difficult to understand. Some
fiber optic coupler fabrication involves beam splitting using microlenses or graded-refractive-index
(GRIN) rods and beam splitters or optical mixers. These beamsplitter devices divide the optical beam into
two or more separated beams. Fabrication of fiber optic couplers may also involve twisting, fusing, and
tapering together two or more optical fibers. This type of fiber optic coupler is a fused biconical taper
coupler. Fused biconical taper couplers use the radiative coupling of light from the input fiber to the
output fibers in the tapered region to accomplish beam splitting. Figure 4-29 illustrates the fabrication
process of a fused biconical taper coupler.
