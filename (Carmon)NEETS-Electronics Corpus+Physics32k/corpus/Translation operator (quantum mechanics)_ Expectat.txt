Consider a single particle in one dimension. Unlike classical mechanics, in quantum mechanics, a particle neither has a well defined position nor a well defined momentum. In the quantum formulation the expectation values play the role of the classical variables. For example, if a particle is in state




|

ψ
⟩


{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
, then the expectation value of position is



⟨
ψ

|




r
^




|

ψ
⟩


{\displaystyle \langle \psi |\mathbf {\hat {r}} |\psi \rangle }
, where






r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
is the position operator.
If a translation operator






T
^



(

x

)


{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )}
acts on the state




|

ψ
⟩


{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
, creating a new state




|


ψ

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |\psi _{2}\rangle }
then the expectation value of position for




|


ψ

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |\psi _{2}\rangle }
is equal to the expectation value of position for




|

ψ
⟩


{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle }
plus the vector x. This result is consistent with what you would expect from an operation that shifts the particle by that amount.

On the other hand, when the translation operator acts on a state, the expectation value of momentum is not changed. This can be proven in a similar way as the above, but using the fact that translation operators commute with the momentum operator. This result is again consistent with expectations: Translating a particle does not change its velocity or mass, so its momentum should not change.
