inherent limitation is the inﬂuence of the current in-feed from
the other end as described earlier. The other source of possible
error is the fault resistance, which cannot be measured online.
Therefore, it has to be assumed at the time of the relay setting
computation, when a value different from what is actually
present during the fault may be picked up. The anticipated
value of the fault resistance is selected arbitrarily and may be a
cause for a gross error when computing the impedance for a
ground fault. Yet another source of error is the mutual
coupling between adjacent transmission line or phases, which
if signiﬁcant, can adversely affect relay operation if not taken
adequately into account when computing the fault impedance.
The distance relaying becomes particularly difﬁcult and some-
times unreliable if applied to some special protection case,
such as multiterminal lines, lines with series compensation,
very short lines, and parallel lines. In all of the cases, selecting
relay settings is quite involved and prone to errors due to
some arbitrary assumptions about the value of the fault im-
pedance.
