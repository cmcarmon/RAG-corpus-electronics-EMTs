This  relationship  is  more  broadly  valid  and  is  the  foundation  of  energy  spectroscopy  of  gamma-rays  using
semiconductors,  gases,  and  cryogenic  liquids  (ε  depending  on  the  material).  While  ε  is  independent  of  the
gamma-ray energy (and is also virtually the same for energy deposited by charged particles), ε in germanium
does increase slightly with decreasing temperature, as does the energy gap. At 77K, ε is 2.96 eV and the energy
gap is 0.72 eV.
