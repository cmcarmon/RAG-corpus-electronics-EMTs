Again we have a relation between the input and the output voltage that is
almost independent of the unreliable gain A, and dependent only on resistor
ratios. But this time the output signal is inverted compared to the input signal,
as indicated by the minus sign. Equation 15.14 for the inverting connection
and the corresponding equation for the non-inverting case, Equation 15.9, are
encountered so frequently that they rapidly become primitives in our circuit
analysis repertoire, as with the voltage-divider and current-divider relations.
