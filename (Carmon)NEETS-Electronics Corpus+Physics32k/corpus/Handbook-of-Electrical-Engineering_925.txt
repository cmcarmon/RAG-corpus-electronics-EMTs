Here H is a constant, P is the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas, and C0 is the concentration of oxidant in
the oxide at the surface and h is of the form A exp(â€“B/kT). Finally, the movement of the oxidant within the
already existing oxide is governed by diffusion: F = D0 (cid:209)C . When all these equations are combined, it is found
that (in the one-dimensional case) oxides grow linearly dy/dt (cid:181) t when the oxide is thin and the oxidant can
move easily through the existing oxide. As the oxide grows thicker dy/dt (cid:181) 
 because the movement of the
oxidant through the existing oxide becomes the rate-limiting step.
