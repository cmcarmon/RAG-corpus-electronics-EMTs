The communication path between two LANs/MANs can be
connected either by a single bridge or multiple bridges. In the
case of connecting with multiple bridges, a point-to-point
protocol, like High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) or an
X.25 connection, can be used between two bridges. Bridges do
not modify the content of the frames they receive but must
contain addressing and routing intelligence. The bridge can also
act as a multiple port switch connecting more than two LANs.
The routing approaches of bridges are as complicated as
routers. The basic routing operation is to avoid forwarding
frames in a closed loop. Each bridge should make a decision
about whether the frame should be forwarded and what LAN
should forward the frame next. The following approaches are
used for routing with bridges:
