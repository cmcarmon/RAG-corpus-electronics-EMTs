In either case, heat dissipated by the resistor constitutes energy leaving the circuit, and
as a consequence the reactive component loses its store of energy over time, resulting in a
measurable decrease of either voltage (capacitor) or current (inductor) expressed on the graph.
The more power dissipated by the resistor, the faster this discharging action will occur, because
power is by deÔ¨Ånition the rate of energy transfer over time.
