Leakage currents are, at room temperature, typically 1 to 10 nA cm–2 active area and per 100-µ depletion
depth. These values represent an order of magnitude reduction in leakage current with respect to surface barrier
detectors. Two factors are relevant. Passivation of silicon surfaces by thermal oxidation is extremely effective in
reducing  leakage  current  around  the  rectifying  contact.  Also,  the  bulk  generation  current  is  reduced  by  the
gettering of metal impurities during the high-temperature oxidation. Float zone silicon for radiation detectors
usually has a minority carrier lifetime longer than 1 ms, and this can be increased an order of magnitude during
detector fabrication [25]. Thus, not only is leakage current reduced, but potential charge collection problems
are also eliminated.
