In the ISO International standard ISO 80000-4(2006), describing the basic physical quantities and units in mechanics as a part of the International standard ISO/IEC 80000, the definition of weight is given as:

Definition





F

g


=
m
g



{\displaystyle F_{g}=mg\,}
,
where m is mass and g is local acceleration of free fall.
Remarks
When the reference frame is Earth, this quantity comprises not only the local gravitational force, but also the local centrifugal force due to the rotation of the Earth, a force which varies with latitude.
The effect of atmospheric buoyancy is excluded in the weight.
In common parlance, the name "weight" continues to be used where "mass" is meant, but this practice is deprecated.

The definition is dependent on the chosen frame of reference. When the chosen frame is co-moving with the object in question then this definition precisely agrees with the operational definition. If the specified frame is the surface of the Earth, the weight according to the ISO and gravitational definitions differ only by the centrifugal effects due to the rotation of the Earth.
