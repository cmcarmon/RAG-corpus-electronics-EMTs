A ﬁlter with the transfer functions in equation 2.18 will
always be stable because it does not have poles outside the
unit circle. FIR ﬁlters can be designed to have a linear phase. A
linear phase is a desirable feature in a number of signal pro-
cessing applications (e.g., image processing). FIR ﬁlters can be
designed by using optimization packages or by using approxi-
mations based on different types of windows. The main draw-
back is that to satisfy demanding magnitude speciﬁcations, the
FIR ﬁlter requires a relatively high number of multiplications,
additions, and storage elements. These facts make FIR ﬁlters
potentially more expensive than IIR ﬁlters in applications
where the number of arithmetic operations or number of
storage elements are expensive or limited. However, FIR ﬁlters
are widely used because they are suitable for designing linear-
phase ﬁlters.
