The secondary system is the part of the electric power system
between the primary system and the consumerâ€™s property. The
secondary distribution system includes distribution transform-
ers, secondary circuits (secondary mains), consumer services
(or service drops), and meters to measure consumer energy
consumption. Usually, the secondary systems are designed in
single phase for areas of residential consumers and in three
phase for areas of industrial or commercial consumers with
high load densities. Secondary voltages are provided by distri-
bution transformers that are connected to the primary system,
