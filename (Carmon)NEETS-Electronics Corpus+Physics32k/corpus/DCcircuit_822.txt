In many Kelvin Double bridge circuits, RM =Rm and RN =Rn. However, the lower the re-
sistances of Rm and Rn, the more sensitive the null detector will be, because there is less
resistance in series with it. Increased detector sensitivity is good, because it allows smaller
imbalances to be detected, and thus a Ô¨Åner degree of bridge balance to be attained. Therefore,
some high-precision Kelvin Double bridges use Rm and Rn values as low as 1/100 of their ratio
arm counterparts (RM and RN , respectively). Unfortunately, though, the lower the values of
Rm and Rn, the more current they will carry, which will increase the effect of any junction
resistances present where Rm and Rn connect to the ends of Ra and Rx. As you can see, high
