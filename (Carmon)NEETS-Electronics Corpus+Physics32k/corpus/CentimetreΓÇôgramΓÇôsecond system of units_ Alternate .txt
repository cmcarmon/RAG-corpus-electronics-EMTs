Electromagnetic relationships to length, time and mass may be derived by several equally appealing methods. Two of them rely on the forces observed on charges. Two fundamental laws relate (seemingly independently of each other) the electric charge or its rate of change (electric current) to a mechanical quantity such as force. They can be written in system-independent form as follows:
The first is Coulomb's law,



F
=

k


C






q
⋅

q

′




d

2






{\displaystyle F=k_{\rm {C}}{\frac {q\cdot q^{\prime }}{d^{2}}}}
, which describes the electrostatic force F between electric charges



q


{\displaystyle q}
and




q

′




{\displaystyle q^{\prime }}
, separated by distance d. Here




k


C





{\displaystyle k_{\rm {C}}}
is a constant which depends on how exactly the unit of charge is derived from the base units.
The second is Ampère's force law,

k

I


I

d




{\displaystyle {\frac {dF}{dL}}=2k_{\rm {A}}{\frac {I\,I^{\prime }}{d}}}
, which describes the magnetic force F per unit length L between currents I and I′ flowing in two straight parallel wires of infinite length, separated by a distance d that is much greater than the wire diameters. Since



I

{\displaystyle I=q/t\,}
and




I

′



/

t


{\displaystyle I^{\prime }=q^{\prime }/t}
, the constant




k


A





{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}}
also depends on how the unit of charge is derived from the base units.
Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism relates these two laws to each other. It states that the ratio of proportionality constants




k


C





{\displaystyle k_{\rm {C}}}
and




k


A





{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}}
must obey




k


C




/


k


A



=

c

2




{\displaystyle k_{\rm {C}}/k_{\rm {A}}=c^{2}}
, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Therefore, if one derives the unit of charge from the Coulomb's law by setting




k


C



=
1


{\displaystyle k_{\rm {C}}=1}
then Ampère's force law will contain a prefactor



2

/


c

2




{\displaystyle 2/c^{2}}
. Alternatively, deriving the unit of current, and therefore the unit of charge, from the Ampère's force law by setting




k


A



=
1


{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}=1}
or




k


A



=
1

/

2


{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}=1/2}
, will lead to a constant prefactor in the Coulomb's law.
Indeed, both of these mutually exclusive approaches have been practiced by the users of CGS system, leading to the two independent and mutually exclusive branches of CGS, described in the subsections below. However, the freedom of choice in deriving electromagnetic units from the units of length, mass, and time is not limited to the definition of charge. While the electric field can be related to the work performed by it on a moving electric charge, the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the moving charge, and thus the work performed by the magnetic field on any charge is always zero. This leads to a choice between two laws of magnetism, each relating magnetic field to mechanical quantities and electric charge:
The first law describes the Lorentz force produced by a magnetic field B on a charge q moving with velocity v:





F

=

α


L



q


v

×

B


.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\alpha _{\rm {L}}q\;\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \;.}


The second describes the creation of a static magnetic field B by an electric current I of finite length dl at a point displaced by a vector r, known as Biot–Savart law:




d

=

α

l

r

r

,


{\displaystyle d\mathbf {B} =\alpha _{\rm {B}}{\frac {Id\mathbf {l} \times \mathbf {\hat {r}} }{r^{2}}}\;,}
where r and






r
^





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
are the length and the unit vector in the direction of vector r respectively.

These two laws can be used to derive Ampère's force law above, resulting in the relationship:




k


A



=

α


L



⋅

α


B






{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}=\alpha _{\rm {L}}\cdot \alpha _{\rm {B}}\;}
. Therefore, if the unit of charge is based on the Ampère's force law such that




k


A



=
1


{\displaystyle k_{\rm {A}}=1}
, it is natural to derive the unit of magnetic field by setting




α


L



=

α


B



=
1



{\displaystyle \alpha _{\rm {L}}=\alpha _{\rm {B}}=1\;}
. However, if it is not the case, a choice has to be made as to which of the two laws above is a more convenient basis for deriving the unit of magnetic field.
Furthermore, if we wish to describe the electric displacement field D and the magnetic field H in a medium other than vacuum, we need to also define the constants ε0 and μ0, which are the vacuum permittivity and permeability, respectively. Then we have (generally)




D

{\displaystyle \mathbf {D} =\epsilon _{0}\mathbf {E} +\lambda \mathbf {P} }
and

M



{\displaystyle \mathbf {H} =\mathbf {B} /\mu _{0}-\lambda ^{\prime }\mathbf {M} }
, where P and M are polarization density and magnetization vectors. The units of P and M are usually so chosen that the factors λ and λ′ are equal to the "rationalization constants"

{\displaystyle c^{2}=1/(\epsilon _{0}\mu _{0}\alpha _{\rm {L}}^{2})}
. If they are equal to one, then the system is said to be "rationalized": the laws for systems of spherical geometry contain factors of 4π (for example, point charges), those of cylindrical geometry – factors of 2π (for example, wires), and those of planar geometry contain no factors of π (for example, parallel-plate capacitors). However, the original CGS system used λ = λ′ = 4π, or, equivalently,

{\displaystyle k_{\rm {C}}\epsilon _{0}=\alpha _{\rm {B}}/(\mu _{0}\alpha _{\rm {L}})=1}
. Therefore, Gaussian, ESU, and EMU subsystems of CGS (described below) are not rationalized.
