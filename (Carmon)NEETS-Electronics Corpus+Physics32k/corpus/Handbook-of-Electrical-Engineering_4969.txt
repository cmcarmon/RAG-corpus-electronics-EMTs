Dielectrics 
are materials that are used primarily to isolate components electrically from each other or ground
or  to  act  as  capacitive  elements  in  devices,  circuits,  and  systems.  Their  insulating  properties  are  directly
attributable to their large energy gap between the highest ﬁlled valence band and the conduction band. The
number of electrons in the conduction band is extremely low, because the energy gap of a dielectric (5 to 7 eV)
is sufﬁciently large to maintain most of the electrons trapped in the lower band. As a consequence, a dielectric,
subjected to an electric ﬁeld, will evince only an extremely small conduction or loss current; this current will
be  caused  by  the  ﬁnite  number  of  free  electrons  available  in  addition  to  other  free  charge  carriers  (ions)
associated usually with contamination by electrolytic impurities as well as dipole orientation losses arising with
polar molecules under ac conditions. Often the two latter effects will tend to obscure the miniscule contribution
of the relatively few free electrons available. Unlike solids and liquids, vacuum and gases (in their nonionized
state) approach the conditions of a perfect insulator—i.e., they exhibit virtually no detectable loss or leakage
current.
