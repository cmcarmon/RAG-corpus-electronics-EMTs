When current flows through a wire, magnetic lines of force are set up around the wire. As the current
increases and decreases in amplitude, the field around the wire expands and collapses accordingly. The
energy produced by the magnetic lines of force collapsing back into the wire tends to keep the current
flowing in the same direction. This represents a certain amount of inductance, which is expressed in
microhenrys per unit length. Figure 3-10 illustrates the inductance and magnetic fields of a transmission
line.
