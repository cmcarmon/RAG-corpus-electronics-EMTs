Magnets produced from magnetic materials are called ARTIFICIAL MAGNETS. They can be made
in a variety of shapes and sizes and are used extensively in electrical apparatus. Artificial magnets are
generally made from special iron or steel alloys which are usually magnetized electrically. The material to
be magnetized is inserted into a coil of insulated wire and a heavy flow of electrons is passed through the
wire. Magnets can also be produced by stroking a magnetic material with magnetite or with another
artificial magnet. The forces causing magnetization are represented by magnetic lines of force, very
similar in nature to electrostatic lines of force.
