There may be great variations in the strength of the radio signal received because of variations in distance
between transmitter and receiver or because of the interposition of metallic objects. In industrial radio telemetry
transmission, these effects can be prevented from disturbing the data by resorting to FM of both the subcarrier
and the carrier so that the telemetered signal is unchanged by undesirable amplitude variations. This method
is called FM/FM telemetry.
