where the phase term f now includes the kx term, and all of the constants of proportionality are included in
the amplitude A. Basically, the assumption is that oscillating currents produce oscillating ﬁelds. The description
of a receiving antenna is analogous: an oscillating ﬁeld induces a periodic current in the conductor.
