harmonic distortion factors. In order to determine the distortion generation in actual circuits one must fabricate
the circuit and then use a harmonic analyzer for sine curve inputs to determine the harmonics present in the
output. An attractive alternative is the use of circuit simulation programs that allow one to investigate circuit
performance  before  fabricating  the  circuit.  In  this  section  a  brief  overview  of  the  techniques  used  in  circuit
simulators for distortion characterization is provided.
