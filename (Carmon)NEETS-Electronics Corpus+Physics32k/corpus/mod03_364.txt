A circuit breaker is a circuit protection device that, like a fuse, will stop current in the circuit if there
is a direct short, excessive current, or excessive heat. Unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker is reusable. The
circuit breaker does not have to be replaced after it has opened or broken the circuit. Instead of replacing
the circuit breaker, you reset it.
