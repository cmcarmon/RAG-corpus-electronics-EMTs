Compensation: The  process  of  physically  altering  a  closed-loop  system  such  that  the  system  has  speciÔ¨Åed
characteristics.  This  alteration  is  achieved  either  by  changing  certain  parameters  in  the  system  or  by
adding a physical system to the closed-loop system; in some cases both methods are used.
