AVCON has been able to develop a unique “homopolar” approach to permanent magnet type bearings
that the company says are signiﬁcantly smaller than prior designs, their control electronics are a fraction
of the weight of previous systems, and power consumption is much lower than in all electromagnetic
designs. Among other advantages cited are virtually zero friction and therefore no lubricant requirement,
no wear, no vibration, longer service life, and very high reliability because single point failure modes are
eliminated. (Courtesy of National Aeronautics and Space Administration.)
