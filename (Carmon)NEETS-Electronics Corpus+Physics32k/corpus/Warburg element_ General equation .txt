The Warburg diffusion element (ZW) is a constant phase element (CPE), with a constant phase of 45° (phase independent of frequency) and with a magnitude inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency by:

{\displaystyle {|Z_{W}|}={\sqrt {2}}{\frac {A_{W}}{\sqrt {\omega }}}}

where AW is the Warburg coefficient (or Warburg constant), j is the imaginary unit and ω is the angular frequency.
This equation assumes semi-infinite linear diffusion, that is, unrestricted diffusion to a large planar electrode.
