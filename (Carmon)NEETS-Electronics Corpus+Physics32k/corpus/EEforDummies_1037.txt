Don’t overdo it when buying a solderless breadboard. You don’t need a 
breadboard the size of Wyoming if you’re making small‐ to medium‐sized 
circuits, such as the ones I show you in Chapter 17. And if you get into the 
middle of designing a circuit and find that you need a little more breadboard 
real estate, you can always make connections between two breadboards. 
Some solderless breadboards have interlocking ridges so you can put several 
together to make a larger breadboard.
