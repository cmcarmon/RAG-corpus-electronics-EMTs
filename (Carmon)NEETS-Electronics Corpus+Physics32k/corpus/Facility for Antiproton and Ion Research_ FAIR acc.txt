Beams of protons will be prepared in the proton linear accelerator, p-LINAC, while heavy ions will be prepared in the UNILAC. Both of them will be fed into the SIS18. From there they will be directed into SIS100 (and SIS300 if applicable). Protons will be used either to produce antiproton beams by directing them on a dedicated production target or directly used for experiments within APPA. These antiprotons will be captured and cooled in the Collector Ring, CR (and RESR when available) before being injected into HESR, where they will be utilised within the PANDA experiment. High energetic heavy ions will either be used directly for studies with the CBM or APPA experiments or to produce unstable ion beams. The latter will be produced in the Rare Isotope Production Target and filtered the Super-FRS, where the NUSTAR experiments will take place.
