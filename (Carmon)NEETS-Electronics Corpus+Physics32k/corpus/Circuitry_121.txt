where  L is  the  inductance  (in  Henries),  µ0 is  the 
permeability  of  free  space,  µr
is  the  relative 
permeability  of  the  magnetic  core,  l is  the  mean 
length  of  the  core  (in  metres),  and  A is  the  cross-
sectional area of the core (in square metres). 
 
Example 2.29 
 
An  inductor  of  100  mH  is  required.  If  a  closed 
magnetic core of length 20 cm, cross-sectional area 
15  cm2 and  relative  permeability  500  is  available, 
determine the number of turns required.
