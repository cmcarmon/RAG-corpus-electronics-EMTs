Multipaths
The ocean contains multiple acoustic paths that split the acoustic energy. When the receiving system can resolve
these  multiple  paths  (or  multipaths),  then  they  should  be  recombined  by  optimal  signal  processing  to  fully
exploit the available acoustic energy for detection [Chan, 1989]. It is also theoretically possible to exploit the
geometrical  properties  of  multipaths  present  in  the  bottom  bounce  path  by  investigation  of  the  apparent
aperture created by the different path arrivals to localize the energy source. In the case of Ô¨Årst-order bottom
bounce transmission, i.e., only one bottom interaction, there are four paths (from source to receiver):
