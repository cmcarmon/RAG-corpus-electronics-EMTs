Forward
 is the computation of the Cartesian position and orientation of the robot end-effector given
kinematics
  is  the  computation  of  the  joint  coordinates  given  the
the  set  of  joint  coordinates. 
Cartesian position and orientation of the end-effector. The inverse kinematic computation may not be
possible in closed form, may have no solution, or may have multiple solutions.
