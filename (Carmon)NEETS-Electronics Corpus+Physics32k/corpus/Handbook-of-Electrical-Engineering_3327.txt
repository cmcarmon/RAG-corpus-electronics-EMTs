Image-Intensiﬁer Tubes
An  image-intensiﬁer  tube  is  a  vacuum  device  which  consists  of  a  photoemissive  surface  onto  which  a  light
image is projected, an electron accelerator, and a phosphor material to view the image. This device, shown in
Fig. 31.14, can have a number of applications, for example, brightening a very weak image for night vision or
converting an infrared image into a visible one.
