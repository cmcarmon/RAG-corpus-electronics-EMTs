It is important to compute the variance of MOS values. A large variance, which indicates an unreliable test,
  mean.  It  is  sometimes
can  occur  because  participants  do  not  known  what  categories  such  as 
useful to present examples of good and bad speech to the listeners before the test to calibrate the 5-point scale
[Papamichalis, 1987]. The MOS values for a variety of speech coders and noise conditions are given in [Daumer,
1982].
