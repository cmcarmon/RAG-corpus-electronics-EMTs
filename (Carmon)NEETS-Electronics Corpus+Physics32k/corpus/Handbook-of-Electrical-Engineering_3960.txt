Microwave Resonators
In a lumped element resonant circuit, stored energy is transferred between an inductor which stores magnetic
energy and a capacitor which stores electric energy, and back again every period. Microwave resonators function
the same way, exchanging energy stored in electric and magnetic forms but with the energy stored spatially.
Resonators are described in terms of their quality factor
