and an entropy of 1.75 bits (Example 6.1). Let’s see if we can ﬁnd a codebook for this four-letter
alphabet that satisﬁes the Source Coding Theorem. The simplest code to try is known as the
simple binary code: convert the symbol’s index into a binary number and use the same number
of bits for each symbol by including leading zeros where necessary.
