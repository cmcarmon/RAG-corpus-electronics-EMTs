A real inductor exhibits richer behavior than that described here. For exam-
ple, it can exhibit a significant coil resistance. The practical significance of this
resistance is that it eventually dissipates any energy stored in the inductor.
Unfortunately, this resistance is usually significant so that inductors make poor
memory devices. When it is necessary to model this energy loss, the coil
resistance can be modeled as a resistor in series with the ideal inductor.
