The UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR (UJT) is a three-terminal, solid-state device with only one 
PN junction. The block diagram below shows the difference in construction between normal transistors 
and the UJT. The area between base 1 and base 2 of the UJT acts as a variable resister. The emitter of the 
UJT acts as the wiper arm. The sequential rise in voltage between the bases is called a voltage gradient. 
The UJT conducts when the emitter is more positive than the voltage gradient at the emitter/base contact 
point. There are many variations of the UJT which are used in switching circuits, oscillators, and wave-
shaping circuits.
