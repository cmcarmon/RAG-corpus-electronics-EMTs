containing the numerical solution of Poisson’s equation as
reference. At high reverse bias, the SCR of the lightly-doped
side of the junction extends to the highly doped access region;
this punchthrough effect results in an (almost) constant de-
pletion capacitance CjPT ¼ eA=Wn (for NA  ND) and is
shown in Figure 5.2(B);
