Here, F is the ﬂux of oxidant (#/cm2/s), N is the number of oxidant atoms required to make up a cubic centimeter
of oxide, and dy/dt is the velocity with which the Si-SiO2 interface moves into the silicon. In general the greater
the concentration of oxidant (C0), the faster the growth of the oxide and the greater the ﬂux of oxidant needed
at the Si-SiO2 interface. Thus, F = ksC0. The ﬂux of oxidant into the oxide from the gaseous environment is
given by:
