Two natural questions relevant to the system design are what
are the dominant error sources causing the growth of the INS
errors between the 1-Hz corrections during the ﬁrst 60 sec, and
what are the dominant error sources that cause the INS error
growth during the period when the position aiding is no
longer available. Both of these question are answerable by the
error budgeting analysis described in Section 4.5.1. The error
budget analysis plot for the position estimate is shown in
Figure 4.5(D). This ﬁgure shows the error contributions from
v, n, n, and the total error from all sources. The plot for the
error contribution from P(0) has not been included because it
is insigniﬁcant for the time period shown. Note that the ﬁgure
plots the standard deviations (STDs). To perform the super-
position check that the errors from the individual sources
add up to the total error at every time instant, the plotted
