Closed-loop capstan drive tape transports were designed to overcome the drawbacks of the open-
loop drive design. They use more than one capstan and/or pinch roller to clamp the magnetic tape in the 
area around the magnetic heads. This keeps tape tension constant and improves the quality of the 
recording or the playback. Figure 4-10 shows the basic arrangement of the closed-loop capstan drive.
