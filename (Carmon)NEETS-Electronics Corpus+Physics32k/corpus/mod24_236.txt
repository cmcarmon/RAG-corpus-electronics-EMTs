Single mode and multimode fibers can have a step-index or graded-index refractive index profile.
The performance of multimode graded-index fibers is usually superior to multimode step-index fibers.
However, each type of multimode fiber can improve system design and operation depending on the
intended application. Performance advantages for single mode graded-index fibers compared to single
mode step-index fibers are relatively small. Therefore, single mode fiber production is almost exclusively
step-index. Figure 3-1 shows the refractive index profile for a multimode step-index fiber and a
multimode graded-index fiber. Figure 3-1 also shows the refractive index profile for a single mode step-
index fiber. Since light propagates differently in each fiber type, figure 3-1 shows the propagation of light
along each fiber.
