Figure 74.1  depicts  several  kinds  of  satellite  links  and  orbits.  The  geostationary  earth  orbit  (GEO)  is  in  the
equatorial plane at an altitude of 35,786 km with a period of one sidereal day (23h 56m 4.09s). This orbit is
sometimes called the Clarke orbit in honor of Arthur C. Clarke who Ô¨Årst described its usefulness for commu-
nications in 1945. GEO satellites appear to be almost stationary from the ground (subject to small perturbations)
and the earth antennas pointing to these satellites may need only limited or no tracking capability.
