To estimate one's own pace, a measure of known distance, such as 66 ft (one chain) or 132 ft (two chains), should be marked in a straight line on level ground. One pace is defined as two footsteps. The distance is paced several times and the number of paces that it takes to walk the distance each time is recorded.
If the distance paced is longer than one chain, the number of paces is divided by the number of chains paced. To determine the average distance of one pace, the total distance walked is divided by the number of paces that it takes to pace that distance. This pacing chart has paces per chain and feet per pace.
Pacing can also be applied to the more commonly used metric system by simply walking 100 m and marking down the number of paces required. Doing that several times and using the average will give a good idea of how many paces are made every 100 m. In the field, paces are counted until the target number for 100 m, which is then repeated.
It is commonly done with pacing beads, with every 100 m being counted with a bead. As noted above, terrain alters pacing and requires practice to master.
