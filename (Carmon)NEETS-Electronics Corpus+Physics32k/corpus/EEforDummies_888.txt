▶✓ Third hand: No, this isn’t a body 
part from your buddy. It’s a tool 
that clamps onto your worktable 
and has adjustable clips that 
hold small parts while you’re 
working. A third hand makes 
tasks such as soldering a heck of 
a lot easier. See Figure 13-4 for an 
example of a third hand that also 
sports a magnifying glass.
