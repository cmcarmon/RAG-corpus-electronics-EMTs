Most of us have experienced some form of electric ”shock,” where electricity causes our body
to experience pain or trauma. If we are fortunate, the extent of that experience is limited to
tingles or jolts of pain from static electricity buildup discharging through our bodies. When we
are working around electric circuits capable of delivering high power to loads, electric shock
becomes a much more serious issue, and pain is the least signiﬁcant result of shock.
