Under normal circumstances, every atom has an equal number of protons and 
electrons, and the atom is said to be electrically neutral. (Note that the helium 
atom has 2 protons and 2 electrons and that the copper atom has 29 of each.) 
The attractive force between the protons and electrons acts like invisible 
glue, holding the atom together, in much the same way that the gravitational 
force of the Earth keeps the moon within sight.
