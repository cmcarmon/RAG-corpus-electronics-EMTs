Pacejka gives a rule of thumb that "at nominal vertical load the relaxation length is of the order of magnitude of the wheel radius" or "approximately equal to half the contact length of the tyre". Relaxations lengths have been found to be between 0.12 and 0.45 meters, with higher values corresponding to higher velocities and heavier loads. Tests on motorcycle tires have found that the ratio of cornering stiffness over lateral stiffness produces values 20-25% higher than those calculated as 63% of the steady state-value. The relaxation length associated with camber thrust has been found to be nearly zero.
