Phonograph pickups use the electromagnetic prin-
ciple. A magnetic field is produced by a permanent 
magnet that is attached to a stylus (needle). The per-
manent magnet is placed inside a small coil. As the 
stylus is tracked through the groove of a record, it 
moves up and down and from side to side in response 
to the audio signal recorded. The movement of the 
magnet in the coil induces a small voltage that varies at 
the audio signal response. The induced voltage is then 
amplified and used to drive a loudspeaker, reproduc-
ing the audio signal.
