The electrical transformer was invented by an American electrical engineer, William Stanley, in 1885 and was
used in the ﬁrst ac lighting installation at Great Barrington, Massachusetts. The ﬁrst transformer was used to
step up the power from 500 to 3000 V and transmitted for a distance of 1219 m (4000 ft). At the receiving end
the voltage was stepped down to 500 V to power street and ofﬁce lighting. By comparison, present transformers
are designed to transmit hundreds of megawatts of power at voltages of 700 kV and beyond for distances of
several hundred miles.
