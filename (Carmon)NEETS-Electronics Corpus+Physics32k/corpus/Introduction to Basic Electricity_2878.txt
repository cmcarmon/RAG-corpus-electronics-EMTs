An autotransformer is a device used to step 
up or step down applied voltage. It is a special type 
of transformer in which the primary and secondary 
windings are both part of the same core. Figure 27-8A  
shows an autotransformer stepping down a volt-
age. Because the secondary consists of fewer turns, 
the voltage is stepped down. Figure 27-8B shows 
an autotransformer stepping up a voltage. Because 
the secondary has more turns than the primary, the 
voltage is stepped up. A disadvantage of the auto-
transformer is that the secondary is not isolated 
from the primary. The advantage is that the auto-
transformer is cheaper and easier to construct than 
a transformer.
