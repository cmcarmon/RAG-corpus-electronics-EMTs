The presence of the on resistance RON complicates the design of logic gates
slightly, but adds more realism to the model. Let us analyze our familiar inverter
circuit shown in Figure 6.14 using the SR model of the MOSFET. In particular,
let us derive its input-output transfer characteristic. Figure 6.39 shows the circuit
model of the inverter using the SR model of the MOSFET.
