Letâ€™s examine the reason for this apparent change in pitch. Assume that the transmitter emits an
audio signal at a frequency of 60 hertz and that the transmitter is traveling at a velocity of 360 feet per
second (fps). At the end of 1 second, the transmitter will have moved from point P to point P1 as shown
in view A of figure 1-20. The total distance from point P to the observer is 1,080 feet. The velocity of
sound is 1,080 feet per second; thus, a sound emitted at point P will reach the observer in 1 second. To
find the wavelength of this transmitted signal, you divide the velocity of the signal (1,080 fps) by the
frequency (60 hertz). The result is 18 feet, as shown below:
