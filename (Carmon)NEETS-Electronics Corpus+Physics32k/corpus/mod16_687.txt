The converter section actually consists of three frequency converters, made up of a mixer, local
oscillator (LO), and required filters. Only one frequency can be converted at a time and pass through the
filters to reach the next converter. The analysis frequency can, however, be changed by altering the
frequency of the LO and adjusting the FREQUENCY control knob.
