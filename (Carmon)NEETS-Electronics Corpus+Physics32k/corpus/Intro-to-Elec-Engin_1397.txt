As the electromagnetic ﬁelds associated with v1(t) and i1(t) propagate down the line, they carry
along the associated voltages and currents that are no different from v1(t) and i1(t) except for a
delay in time, because the charges (and therefore current) move down the line at ﬁnite velocity
vg. Thus, at output terminals c and d in Figure 15.1.3, which are a distance l apart, the voltage
