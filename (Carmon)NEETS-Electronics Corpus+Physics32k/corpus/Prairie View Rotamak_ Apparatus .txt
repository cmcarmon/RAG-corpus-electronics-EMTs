The experimental apparatus consists of a vacuum vessel, electromagnetic coils, a high-power radio-frequency (RF) generation system to run the rotating magnetic field (RMF), and diagnostics. The vacuum vessel is made of Pyrex glass and is 80 cm long and 40 cm in diameter. The electromagnetic coils can produce up to 230 Gauss (0.023 Tesla) magnetic fields center of the vacuum vessel. Another electromagnetic coil running through the axis of the vacuum vessel can produce the magnetic field necessary to make the apparatus a spherical tokamak. The RF generation system can deliver 400 kW of power to the plasma in the form of a rotating magnetic field at a frequency of 500 kHz. The RMF can run for 40ms at a time.
