Gate-assisted turn-off techniques are used to even further reduce the turn-off time of an ASCR. The appli-
cation of a negative voltage to the gate during turn-off helps to evacuate stored charge in the device and aids
the recovery mechanisms. This will in effect reduce the turn-off time by a factor of up to 2 over the conventional
device.
