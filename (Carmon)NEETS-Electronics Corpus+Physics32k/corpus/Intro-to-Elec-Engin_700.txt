7.2.21 For the zener diode regulator of Figure P7.2.20,
assuming that VS varies between 40 and 60 V, with
RS = 100  and RL = 1 k, select a zener diode
and its regulator resistor such that VL is maintained
at 30 V. You may assume zero zener resistance.
7.2.22 Choose R and ﬁnd the smallest load resistance
allowed in Figure P7.2.20 when VZ = 12 V and
the source is 25 V ± 20% with RS = 0. Assume
a maximum desired diode current of 20 mA and a
minimum of 1 mA.
*7.2.23 Two zener diodes are connected as shown in Fig-
ure P7.2.23. For each diode VZ = 5 V. Reverse
saturation currents are 2 µA for D1 and 4 µA for
D2. Calculate v1 and v2: (a) when VS = 4 V, and
(b) if VS is raised to 8 V.
