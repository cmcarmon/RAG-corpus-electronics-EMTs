Both editions have used retro packaging as part of the "throwback" theme. The first release featured the 1940s Pepsi-Cola script in royal blue on a modern navy blue background with the word "throwback" written in the modern font, while the 1973–1996 Mountain Dew logo was featured on a modern green background.
With the second release in December 2009, more accurate retro packaging was used. Pepsi used an exact replica of the 1973–1987 logo, while Mountain Dew used its original hillbilly theme. The use of Mountain Dew's original theme is a stark reversal of Pepsi's decision to distance the drink from its Appalachia origins, as well as a stark contrast from the drink's current male demographic, particularly those that participate in extreme sports or are involved with the gamer culture.
All subsequent releases of the Throwback drinks have used the second release's packaging.
