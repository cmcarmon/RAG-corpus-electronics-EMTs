Cascading a ﬁlter with the preampliﬁer will result in better performance by eliminating noise. Active ﬁlters
are commonly used because of their compact design, but passive ﬁlters are still in use. The cut-off frequency,
,  is  one  of  the  important  performance  indices  of  a  ﬁlter  that  has  to  be  designed  to  match  the  channel’s
f
c
 is a function of the preampliﬁer bandwidth, its output SNR, and the output SNR
requirements. The value
