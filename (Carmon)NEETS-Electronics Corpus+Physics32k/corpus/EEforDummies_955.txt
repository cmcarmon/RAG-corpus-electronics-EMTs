If you drag your feet across a carpeted floor, your body takes on a static 
charge. If you then touch a metal object, such as a doorknob or a metal sink, 
the static quickly discharges from your body, and you feel a slight shock. This 
is known as electrostatic discharge (ESD), and can run as high as 50,000 V. The 
resulting current is small — in the μA range — because of the high resistance 
of the air that the charges arc through as they leave your fingertips, and it 
doesn’t last very long. So static shocks of the doorknob variety generally 
don’t inflict bodily injury — but they can easily destroy sensitive electronic 
components.
