The preceding paragraph addresses nonuniqueness in determining an input-output system description. In
addition, state models developed from input-output descriptions are not unique. Suppose the transfer function
of a single-input, single-output linear system is known exactly. The state variable model of this system is not
unique for at least two reasons. An arbitrarily high-order state variable model can be found that will have this
same  transfer  function.  There  is,  however,  a  unique  minimal  or  irreducible  order nmin  from  among  all  state
models that have the speciÔ¨Åed transfer function. A state model of this order will have the desirable properties
of controllability and observability. It is interesting to point out that the minimal order may be less than the
actual order of the physical system.
