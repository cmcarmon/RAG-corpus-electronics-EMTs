2. For the equation of node B, a similar situation exists. Notice the coefﬁcient of VB to be
the positive sum of the conductances connected to node B; the coefﬁcient of VA is the
negative sum of the conductances connected between B and A. The right-hand side of the
equation is the sum of the current sources feeding into node B.
