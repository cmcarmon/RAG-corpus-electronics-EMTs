A main source of extrinsic coupling loss in fiber-to-fiber connections is poor fiber alignment. The
three basic coupling errors that occur during fiber alignment are fiber separation (longitudinal
misalignment), lateral misalignment, and angular misalignment. Most alignment errors are the result of
mechanical imperfections introduced by fiber jointing techniques. However, alignment errors do result
from installers not following proper connection procedures.
