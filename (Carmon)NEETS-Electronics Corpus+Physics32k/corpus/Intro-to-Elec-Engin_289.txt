which is the equation of the universal resonance curve plotted in Figure 3.4.9. The curve
applies equally well to the parallel GLC circuit with ¯Z/Z0 as the ordinate, when the value of
Qp = ω0C/G. The bandwidth and the half-power points in a resonant circuit (either series or
parallel) correspond to ω0/Q and 2δQ = ±1 when the magnitude Y/Y0 or Z/Z0 is 0.707.
