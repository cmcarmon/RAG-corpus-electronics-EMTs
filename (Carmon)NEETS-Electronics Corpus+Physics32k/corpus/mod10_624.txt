When antennas are located near dense forests or among buildings, horizontally polarized waves 
suffer lower losses than vertically polarized waves, especially above 100 megahertz. Small changes in 
antenna locations do not cause large variations in the field intensity of horizontally polarized waves. 
When vertical polarization is used, a change of only a few meters in the antenna location may have a 
considerable effect on the received signal strength. This is the result of interference patterns that produce 
standing waves in space when spurious reflections from trees or buildings occur.
