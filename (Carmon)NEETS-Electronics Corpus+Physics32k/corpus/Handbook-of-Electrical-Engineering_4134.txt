Conducted  Emission  Testing. Measurements  are  recommended  to  be  performed  inside  of  an  RF  shielded
room in order to eliminate interference from ambient electromagnetic ﬁelds. The system units are placed on
a nonconducting table 0.8 m high and 10 cm from the rear wall of the RF shielded enclosure. The measurements
are performed with a line impedance stabilization network (LISN). This type of network is speciﬁcally designed
to present a known impedance to the device under test, ﬁlter the noise present on the power line, and to match
impedances  with  the  measurement  receiver.  Figure  40.17  shows  the  typical  FCC  LISN  circuit,  applicable  for
monitoring the conducted noise present on either the phase or neutral line. Data is collected across phase and
neutral  to  ground  over  the  450-kHz  to  30-MHz  frequency  range  and  is  compared  with  the  aforementioned
limits.
