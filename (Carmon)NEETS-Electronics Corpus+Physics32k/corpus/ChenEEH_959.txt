Consider again the example circuit C1 introduced in Section
4.3 (the graph of C1 is shown in Figure 4.7). A modiﬁed
version of C1 with one additional edge—the edge e6—is
shown in Figure 4.12. Also shown with thicker edges in Figure
4.12 is a spanning tree for the modiﬁed circuit C1. Note that
the basis edge e6 does not belong to any of the fundamental
cycles of the circuit depicted in Figure 4.12. In fact, the edge e6
does not belong to any cycles of the circuit in Figure 4.12 at all.
Such basis edges that do not belong to any cycles are called
isolated while the rest of the basis edges are called main. Note
that any isolated edge must necessarily by deﬁnition be a basis
edge.23
