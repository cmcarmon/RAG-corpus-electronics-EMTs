Electric field strength 
 
The strength of an electric field (5) is proportional 
to  the  applied  potential  difference  and  inversely  
proportional  to  the  distance  between  the  two 
conductors. The electric field strength is given by: 
 
E = V / d
where E is the electric field strength (V/m), V is the 
applied  potential  difference  (V)  and  d is  the 
distance (m). 
 
Example 1.22 
 
Two parallel conductors are separated by a distance 
of  25  mm.  Determine  the  electric  field  strength  if 
they are fed from a 600 V d.c. supply.
