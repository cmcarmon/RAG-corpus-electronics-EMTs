The likelihood of head-on collision is at its greatest on roads with narrow lanes, sharp curves, no separation of lanes of opposing traffic and high volumes of traffic. Crash severity, measured as risk of death and injury, and repair costs to vehicles, increases as speed increases.
Therefore the roads with the greatest risk of head-on collision are busy single-carriageway roads outside urban areas where speeds are highest.
Contrast this with motorways, which rarely have a high risk of head-on collision in spite of the high speeds involved, because of the median separation treatments such as cable barriers, concrete step barriers, Jersey barriers, metal crash barriers, and wide medians.
