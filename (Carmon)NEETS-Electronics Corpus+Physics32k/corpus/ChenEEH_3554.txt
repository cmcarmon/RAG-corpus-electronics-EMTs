encloses the origin. To compute the inverse z-transform, we
need information not only about the functional form of the z-
transform but also about the region of convergence. In fact,
two identical functions with different regions of convergence
have different inverse transforms.
Let us consider the case of a z-transform X(z) with two
poles located at z ¼ a and z ¼ b, aj j < bj j. There are three
possible regions of convergence:
. ROC1—the region zj j < aj j
. ROC2—the annulus aj j < zj j < bj j
. ROC3—the region zj j > bj j
Figure 1.13 shows the three possible regions of convergence
for a ¼ 1=2 and b ¼ 2. To select the correct region of conver-
gence, we need further information about the signal.
