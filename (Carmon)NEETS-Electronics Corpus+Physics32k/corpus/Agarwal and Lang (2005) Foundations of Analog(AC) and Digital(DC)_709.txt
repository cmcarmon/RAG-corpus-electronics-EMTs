A sender wishing to place a logical 0 on a wire can therefore output the
voltage VL, which falls within the valid range for a logical 0. Receivers observing
the value VL transmitted on the wire will correctly interpret it as a logical 0.
However, the presence of even the smallest amount of (positive) noise will force
the voltage signal on the wire into the forbidden region, thereby causing the
signal to become invalid. Thus, we say that the representation of Figure 5.5
offers no margin for noise.
