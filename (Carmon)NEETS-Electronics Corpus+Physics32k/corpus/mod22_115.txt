When labeling the outside of a floppy disk, write the label before attaching it to the disk. Never use a 
pencil or ballpoint pen to write on a label once that label has been attached to a disk. When you use an 
instrument with a sharp point to write on the label, you can actually etch into the surface of the disk 
underneath the protective sheath, thereby destroying that disk. If you must write on a label once it has 
been attached to a disk, use a felt-tip marker.
