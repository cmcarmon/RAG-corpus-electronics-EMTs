For power factors (leading or lagging) greater than 0.5, both wattmeters read positive, and the
sum of the two readings gives the total power. For a power factor less than 0.5 (leading or lagging),
the smaller reading wattmeter should be given a negative sign and the total real power absorbed by
the load (which has to be positive) is given by the difference between the two wattmeter readings.
Figure 4.3.2 shows a plot of the load power factor versus the ratio Wl /Wh, where Wl and Wh are
the lower and higher readings of the wattmeters, respectively.
