The band-stop class of ﬁlters is designed to reject signals over
the selected bandwidth and pass all other frequencies. There-
fore, these ﬁlters are also called band rejection ﬁlters. They can
be used, for example, to reject only the harmonics generated by
a nonlinear circuit or to cancel out interferences at selected
frequencies. The basic strategy of band-stop ﬁlter design is to
place resonators in parallel with the main transmission line.
When these resonators are in resonance, they short-circuit the
signal at that particular frequency. At other frequencies, they
do not load the main transmission line and are therefore
invisible to the signal.
