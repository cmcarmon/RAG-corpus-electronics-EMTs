BCA v. Singh and several other high-profile cases prompted three organizations (Sense About Science, Index on Censorship, and English PEN) - all concerned about free speech and scientific debate - to join forces in the Libel Reform Campaign. On 25 April 2013, the Defamation Act 2013 received Royal Assent and became law. The purpose of the reformed law of defamation is to ‘ensure that a fair balance is struck between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation’. Under the new law, plaintiffs must show that they suffer serious harm before the court will accept the case. Additional protection for website operators, defence of ‘responsible publication on matters of public interest’, and new statutory defences of truth and honest opinion are also part of the key areas covered by the new law.
