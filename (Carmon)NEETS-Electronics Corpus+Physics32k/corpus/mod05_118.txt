The next step is to add another set of brushes. These now become the output brushes of the 
amplidyne. They are placed against the commutator in a position perpendicular to the original brushes, as 
shown in figure 1-24. The previously shorted brushes are now called the "quadrature" brushes. This is 
because they are in quadrature (perpendicular) to the output brushes. The output brushes are in line with 
the armature flux. Therefore, they pick off the voltage induced in the armature windings at this point. The 
voltage at the output will be the same as in the original generator, 115 volts in our example.
