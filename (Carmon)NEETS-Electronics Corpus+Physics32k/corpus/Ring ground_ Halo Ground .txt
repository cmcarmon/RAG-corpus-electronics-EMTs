A halo ground is a type of ring ground that, instead of being installed outside and underground, is installed inside, near the top of a building or structure. The ground reference for all equipment inside the area being protected is separate from the halo. The halo is connected to the main building ground, which may include an underground ring ground outside the building, with vertical conductors especially in the corners of the building. Electrical equipment is also often placed in fully enclosed metal cabinets, which function as Faraday cages to further protect the equipment. The halo may be connected to structural metallic elements such as door frames, building steel, window frames, and air conditioning vents.
A typical halo ground is constructed of #2 insulated copper wire and is installed six inches below the ceiling, and entirely encircles the area that it is protecting.
