There are two main differences between sound waves and light waves. The first difference is in
velocity. Sound waves travel through air at the speed of approximately 1,100 feet per second; light waves
travel through air and empty space at a speed of approximately 186,000 miles per second. The second
difference is that sound is composed of longitudinal waves (alternate compressions and expansions of
matter) and light is composed of transverse waves in an electromagnetic field.
