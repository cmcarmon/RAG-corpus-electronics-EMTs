Multiplication  and  division  using 
exponents 
 
Exponent notation really comes into its own when 
values  have  to  be  multiplied  or  divided.  When 
multiplying two values expressed using exponents, 
you  simply  need  to  add  the  exponents.  Here’s  an 
example: 
 
(2 × 102) × (3 × 106) = (2 × 3) × 10(2+6)
Similarly,  when  dividing  two  values  which  are 
expressed  using  exponents,  you  only  need  to 
subtract the exponents. As an example: 
 
(4 × 106) ÷ ( 2 × 104) = 4/2 × 10(6(cid:1)4) = 2 × 102
In either case it’s important to remember to specify 
the units, multiples and sub-multiples in which you 
are working (e.g. A, k<, mV, µF, etc). 
 
Example 1.11 
 
A current of 3 mA flows in a resistance of 33 k<.
Determine the voltage dropped across the resistor. 
 
Solution 
 
Voltage is equal to current multiplied by resistance
(see page 7). Thus: 
 
V = I × R = 3 mA × 33 k<
Expressing this using exponent notation gives: 
 
V = (3 × 10(cid:1)3) × (33 × 103) V
Separating the exponents gives: 
 
V = 3 × 33 × 10(cid:1)3 × 103 V
Thus V = 99 × 10((cid:1)3+3)
 
Example 1.12 
 
A current of 45 µA flows in a circuit. What charge 
is transferred in a time interval of 20 ms? 
 
Solution 
 
Charge is equal to current  multiplied by  time (see 
the definition of the ampere on page 3). Thus: 
 
Q = I t = 45 µA × 20 ms
