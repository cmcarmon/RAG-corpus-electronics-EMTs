1. With a wire stripper, trim the insulation from the wire about one thirty-second of an inch longer 
than the length of the terminal barrel. When using a wire stripper, be sure to use the correct size 
stripping slot for the wire size used. Otherwise, all the insulation will not be removed or, if the 
slot is too small, the outside strands of the conductor will be nicked and consequently weakened. 
When a knife is used for stripping wire, care should be used to prevent nicking the strands. Slip 
the spaghetti or heat-shrinkable tubing over the wire and back far enough to be out of the way of 
the crimping operation.
