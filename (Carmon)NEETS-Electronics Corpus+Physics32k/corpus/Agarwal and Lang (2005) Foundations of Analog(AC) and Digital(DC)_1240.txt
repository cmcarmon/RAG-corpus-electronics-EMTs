1. Although we will focus primarily on linear, time-invariant capacitors in this text, we note that
some interesting transducers such as electric microphones and speakers, and other electric sensors
and actuators, are appropriately modeled with time-varying capacitors. Similarly, most capacitors
used in electronic equipment (paper, mica, ceramic, etc.) are linear, but often vary a small amount
with temperature (a part of 104 per degree centigrade). But many are nonlinear. The charge
associated with a reverse-biased semiconductor diode, for example, varies as the 2/3 power of
voltage, because the distance d, the effective width of the space-charge layer,
is a function of
voltage
