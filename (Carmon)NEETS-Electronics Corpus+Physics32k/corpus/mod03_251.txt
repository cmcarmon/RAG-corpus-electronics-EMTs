A MULTIMETER is a single meter that combines the functions of a dc ammeter, a dc voltmeter, an
ac ammeter, an ac voltmeter, and an ohmmeter. It is more convenient to have one meter with several
functions than several meters each with a single function. The various functions of a multimeter are
selected by use of the appropriate function switch positions, jacks, and meter scales. A mirror may be
used on the scale of a multimeter to eliminate parallax error.
