KIRCHHOFF’S LAWS—(1) The algebraic sum of the currents flowing toward any point and the
current flowing from that point in an electric network is zero. (2) The algebraic sum of the products
of the current and resistance in each of the conductors in any closed path in a network is equal to the
algebraic sum of the electromotive forces in the path.
