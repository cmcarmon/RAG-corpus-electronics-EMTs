Pure sine waves are basic wave shapes from which other wave shapes can be constructed. Any 
waveform that is not a pure sine wave consists of two or more sine waves. Adding the correct frequencies 
at the proper phase and amplitude will form square waves, sawtooth waves, and other nonsinusoidal 
waveforms.
