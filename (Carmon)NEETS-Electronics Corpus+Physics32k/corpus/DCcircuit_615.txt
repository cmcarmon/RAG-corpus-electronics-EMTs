First, we need to determine what happens to the resistances of parallel subsections R1//R2
and R3//R4. If neither R3 nor R4 have changed in resistance value, then neither will their
parallel combination. However, since the resistance of R2 has decreased while R1 has stayed
the same, their parallel combination must decrease in resistance as well:
