reliability in high-moisture and high-strain environments. Manufacturers also design radiation-hard fibers
for nuclear power, space, and military systems. Radiation resistant fibers operate after exposure to nuclear
radiation. Shipboard system performance requirements determine whether the use of hermetic and
radiation resistant fibers or less costly commercial optical fibers is necessary.
