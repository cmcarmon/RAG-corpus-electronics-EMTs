The Boltzmann constant kB (often abbreviated k) may be used in place of the gas constant by working in pure particle count, N, rather than amount of substance, n, since




R
=

N


A




k


B



,



{\displaystyle R=N_{\rm {A}}k_{\rm {B}},\,}

where NA is the Avogadro constant. For example, the ideal gas law in terms of Boltzmann's constant is




P
V
=

k


B



N
T
.




{\displaystyle PV=k_{\rm {B}}NT.\,\!}

where N is the number of particles (molecules in this case), or to generalize to an inhomogeneous system the local form holds:




P
=

k


B



n
T
.




{\displaystyle P=k_{\rm {B}}nT.\,\!}

where n is the number density.
