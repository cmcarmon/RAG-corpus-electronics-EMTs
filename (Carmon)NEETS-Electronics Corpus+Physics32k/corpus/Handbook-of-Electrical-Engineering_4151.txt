10-kHz and the CIGRE 500-Hz and (2) the use of networks of wideband magnetic direction ﬁnders, networks
of  wideband  time-of-arrival  detectors,  and  networks  combining  the  two  technologies,  such  networks  now
covering  the  U.S.,  Canada,  Japan,  Korea,  Taiwan,  most  of  Europe,  and  parts  of  many  other  countries.  The
average ﬂash density varies considerably with geographical location, generally increasing with decreasing lati-
tude.  Typical  ground  ﬂash  densities  are  1  to  5  km–2 yr–1,  with  the  world’s  highest  being  30  to  50  km–2 yr–1.
Signiﬁcant  variations  in  ﬂash  density  are  observed  with  changes  in  local  meteorological  conditions  within
distances of the order of 10 km, for example, perpendicular to and inland from the Florida coastline. A ground
ﬂash density map of the U.S. for 1989, obtained from the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network of 114
wideband magnetic direction ﬁnders, is given by Orville [1991]. Flash densities in the U.S. are maximum in
Florida  with  10  to  15  km–2 yr–1  and  minimum  along  portions  of  the  Paciﬁc  coast  which  has  essentially  no
lightning.
