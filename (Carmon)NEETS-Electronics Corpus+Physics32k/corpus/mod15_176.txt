This voltage is normally about 2.5 volts and is commonly termed "stickoff" voltage. It is obtained 
from the secondary of a small transformer. The voltage induced in the secondary of the transformer shifts 
the 0º position of the coarse CT To reestablish a new 0º position, the stator of the coarse CT must be 
turned through an angle that induces an opposing 2.5 volts in the rotor to cancel the stickoff voltage. 
Therefore, at 0º the two voltages cancel and no input exists to drive the servo amplifier. Should the rotor 
of the CT stop at 180º, the same 2.5 volts would be induced in the rotor. However, it would be in phase 
with the stickoff voltage and no cancellation would occur. The end result is an error signal at 180º that 
drives the dual-speed synchro system out of any false synchronizations.
