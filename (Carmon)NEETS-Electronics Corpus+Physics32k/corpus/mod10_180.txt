When a capacitor is connected across a source of voltage, such as a battery, it is charged by a
particular amount, depending on the voltage and the value of capacitance. (See figure 1-25.) Because of
the emf (electromotive force) of the battery, negative charges flow to the lower plate, leaving the upper
plate positively charged. Along with the growth of charge, the electric field is also building up. The flux
lines are directed from the positive to the negative charges and at right angles to the plates. When the
capacitor is fully charged, the voltage of the capacitor is equal to the voltage of the source and opposite in
polarity. The charged capacitor stores the energy in the form of an electric field. It can be said, therefore,
that an electric field indicates voltage.
