Example  6.2.10  As  an  example,  the  circuit  of  Fig.  6.12  is  absolutely  stable,  since  from  Eq.  (6.15)  the  only
poles of its transfer function are s = –1, –3, which are both in the left half-plane. There are countless examples
of conditionally stable circuits that are extremely useful, for example, a network consisting of a single capacitor
with C = 1 F with input current I(s) and output voltage V(s). The transfer function is H(s) = Z(s) = 1/Cs =
1/s,  which  has  the  simple  pole  s  =  0  on  the  jw-axis.  Figure  6.13  illustrates  a  circuit  which  is  unstable.  The
transfer function is
