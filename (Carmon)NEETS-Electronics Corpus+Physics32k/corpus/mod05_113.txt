Assume that the characteristics of this generator enable it to produce approximately 87 amperes of 
armature current at 115 volts at the output terminals. This represents an output power of approximately 
10,000 watts (P = IE). You can see that the power gain of this generator is 100. In effect, 100 watts 
controls 10,000 watts.
