band trunk lines, which carry speech signals from many users. When the two parties hang up
upon completion of the telephone call, the radio channel then becomes available for another user.
During the telephone conversation, if the signal strength drops below a preset threshold, the
MTSO monitors and Ô¨Ånds a neighboring cell that receives a stronger signal and automatically
switches (in a fraction of a second) the mobile user to the base station of the adjacent cell. If a
mobile user is outside of the assigned service area, the mobile telephone may be placed in a roam
mode, which allows the user to initiate and receive calls.
