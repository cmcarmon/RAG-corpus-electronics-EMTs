The negative effect of environmental extremes on tape can also cause tape failure. Magnetic tape is
very flexible and can be used in a wide range of environmental conditions. It’s designed for use in a
temperature range of about 2 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 20 to 55 degrees Celsius), and in a relative
humidity range of about 10 to 95%. Of course, these numbers are the extreme. Ideally, magnetic tape
should be used and stored at a temperature of about 60 to 80º F (room temperature), and in a relative
humidity of about 40 to 60%.
