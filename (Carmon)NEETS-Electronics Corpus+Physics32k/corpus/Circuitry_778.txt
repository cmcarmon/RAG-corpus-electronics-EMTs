16.2  Sketch  circuit  diagrams  to  show  how  the 
following  devices  can  be  interfaced  to  a 
 
logic  circuit  based  on  conventional  LS-
 
 
TTL logic: 
(a) an LED 
 
(b) a normally-open push button 
 
(c) a relay 
 
 
(d) a piezoelectric audible transducer. 
16.3  With  the  aid  of  a  circuit  diagram,  explain  
the  operation  of  a  threshold  light  level 
 
sensor. Specify the type of sensor used and 
 
explain  how  the  response  might  vary  with 
 
 
light of different wavelengths.
