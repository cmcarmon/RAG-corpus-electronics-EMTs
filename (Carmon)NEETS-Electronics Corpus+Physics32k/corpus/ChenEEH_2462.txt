Comparing the radiation resistances of a small slot in equation
6.186 to that of a small dipole antenna in equation 6.140, one
sees that Rrad(dipole)  Rrad(slot) ¼ Z2
4 , which is consistent with
the general impedance relationship of equation 6.180. As shown
in equation 6.184, a narrow slot antenna (see Figure 6.16) has
the same sin2 u power pattern as that of a small dipole antenna.
The small slot antenna has Ef and Hu radiation ﬁelds, in con-
trast with the Eu and Hf radiation ﬁelds of its complementary
small dipole antenna.
