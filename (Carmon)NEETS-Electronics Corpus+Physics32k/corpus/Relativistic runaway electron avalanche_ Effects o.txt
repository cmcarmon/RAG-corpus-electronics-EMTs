The large population of energetic electrons produced in RREA will produce a correspondingly large population of energetic photons by bremsstrahlung. These photons are proposed as the source of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. Large RREA events in thunderstorms may also contribute rare but large radiation doses to commercial airline flights. The American physicist Joseph Dwyer has coined the term "dark lightning" for this phenomenon, which is still the subject of research.
