Magnetic Tape
Magnetic  tape  currently  provides  the  cheapest  form  of  storage  for  large  quantities  of  computer  data  in  a
nonvolatile form. The tape is arranged on a reel and has several different packaging styles. It is made from a
polyester  transportation  layer  with  a  deposited  layer  of  oxide  having  a  property  similar  to  a  ferrite  material
with a large hysteresis. Magnetic tape is packaged either in a cartridge, on a reel, or in a cassette. The magnetic
cartridge is manufactured in several tape lengths and cartridge sizes capable of storing up to 2 G (giga) bytes
of data. These can be purchased in many popular preformatted styles.
