These are some difficulties faced in centrifugal pumps:

Cavitation—the net positive suction head (NPSH) of the system is too low for the selected pump
Wear of the impeller—can be worsened by suspended solids
Corrosion inside the pump caused by the fluid properties
Overheating due to low flow
Leakage along rotating shaft.
Lack of prime—centrifugal pumps must be filled (with the fluid to be pumped) in order to operate
Surge
