Token bucket algorithm (Tanenbaum, 1996) is almost
always used for trafﬁc shaping. Token bucket is synonymous
to a bucket with depth b, in which tokens are collected at a rate
r. When the bucket becomes full, extra tokens are lost. A source
can send data only if it can grab and destroy sufﬁcient tokens
from the bucket.
