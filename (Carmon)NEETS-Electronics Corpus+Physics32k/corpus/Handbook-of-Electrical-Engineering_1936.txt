Retiming
Retiming
 is similar to pipelining but yet different in some ways [Leiserson et al., 1983]. Retiming is the process
of moving the delays around in the data ﬂow graph. Removal of one delay from all input edges of a node and
insertion  of  one  delay  to  each  outgoing  edge  of  the  same  node  is  the  simplest  example  of  retiming.  Unlike
pipelining, retiming does not increase the latency of the system. However, retiming alters the number of delay
elements in the system. Retiming can reduce the critical path of the data ﬂow graph. As a result, it can lead to
clock  period  reduction  in  hardware  implementations  or  critical  path  of  the  acyclic  precedence  graph  or  the
iteration period in programmable software system implementations.
