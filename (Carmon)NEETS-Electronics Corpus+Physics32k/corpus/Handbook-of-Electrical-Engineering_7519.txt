When a low logic level is applied to the inverter’s input, Q1’s base-emitter junction will be forward biased
and the base-collector junction will be reverse biased. This circuit condition will turn on Q1 so that the collector
terminal is shorted to the emitter and, therefore, to ground (low level). This low voltage is also on the base of
Q2 and turns Q2 off. With Q2 off, there will be insufﬁcient base current into Q3, turning it off also. Q2 leakage
current is shunted to ground with a resistor to prevent the partial turning on of Q3. The collector voltage of
