In the preceding section (“Calculating RC time constants”), you find out that 
a capacitor in a simple RC circuit reaches nearly its full charge at approxi-
mately five times the RC time constant, T. T is simply the value of the resis-
tance (in ohms) times the value of the capacitance (in farads). So you can 
calculate the time it takes to charge and discharge the capacitor in your 
 circuit as follows:
