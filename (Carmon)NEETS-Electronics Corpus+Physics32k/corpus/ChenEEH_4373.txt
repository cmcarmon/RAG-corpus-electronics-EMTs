Equation 2.3 describes a dynamical system in R2. The x1
denotes the angle of the pendulum from the vertical position,
and x2 denotes the angular velocity. This system has two
equilibrium points. One of them is located as shown in
Figure 2.7(left), and the other is located as shown in Figure
2.7(right). Mathematically, these two equilibrium points can
be represented by (2kp, 0) and (2kp þ p, 0), respectively, for
k ¼ 0,  1,  2, . . ., N .
