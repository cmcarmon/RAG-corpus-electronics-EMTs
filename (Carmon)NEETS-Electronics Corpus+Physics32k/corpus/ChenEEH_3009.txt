Figure 11.17 along with its geometry. By looking at the fre-
quency scale of the plot, it is apparent that higher resonances
do not correspond to harmonic frequency of active devices
that may be integrated with the antenna. Note that the input
impedance was obtained by full-wave analysis. Measured radi-
ation patterns of these types of antenna are comparable to that
of a standard rectangular geometry patch antenna. In addition,
circular geometry patch antennas are often more compact than
rectangular geometry patch antennas. Note that the antenna is
fabricated on a standard RT/Duroid of permittivity 2.33 and a
thickness of 31 mils. A 1208 sector of the antenna has been
removed for optimal impedance. A microstrip feed is placed
308 from the edge of the voided sector. The radius of the
antenna is 740 mils.
