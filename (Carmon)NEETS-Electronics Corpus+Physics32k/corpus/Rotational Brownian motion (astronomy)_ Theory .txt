Consider a binary that consists of two massive objects (stars, black holes etc.) and that is embedded in a stellar system containing a large number of stars. Let




M

{\displaystyle M_{1}}
and




M

2




{\displaystyle M_{2}}
be the masses of the two components of the binary whose total mass is

{\displaystyle M_{12}=M_{1}+M_{2}}
. A field star that approaches the binary with impact parameter

the latter expression is valid in the limit that gravitational focusing dominates the encounter rate. The rate of encounters with stars that interact strongly with the binary, i.e. that satisfy

{\displaystyle V_{\rm {bin}}}
is the relative velocity of the two stars in the binary. The change in the field star's specific angular momentum with respect to the binary,



l


{\displaystyle l}
, is then Δl ≈ a Vbin. Conservation of angular momentum implies that the binary's angular momentum changes by Δlbin ≈ -(m/μ12)Δl where m is the mass of a field star and μ12 is the binary reduced mass. Changes in the magnitude of lbin correspond to changes in the binary's orbital eccentricity via the relation e = 1 - lb2/GM12μ12a. Changes in the direction of lbin correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary, leading to rotational diffusion. The rotational diffusion coefficient is

where ρ = mn is the mass density of field stars.
Let F(θ,t) be the probability that the rotation axis of the binary is oriented at angle θ at time t. The evolution equation for F is

Hence, trel is the time constant for the binary's orientation to be randomized by torques from field stars.
