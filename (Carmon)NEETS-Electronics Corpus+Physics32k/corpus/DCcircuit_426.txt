To express a quantity in a different metric preﬁx that what it was originally given, all we need
to do is skip the decimal point to the right or to the left as needed. Notice that the metric preﬁx
”number line” in the previous section was laid out from larger to smaller, left to right. This
layout was purposely chosen to make it easier to remember which direction you need to skip
the decimal point for any given conversion.
