Figure 112.1 (adapted and updated from Rimvall [1987,1988]) illustrates the development of CACSD pack-
ages over the last four decades. In order to put events into proper context, other key inﬂuencing factors, chieﬂy
hardware  and  software  developments,  are  also  shown.  In  this  section  we  describe  the  background  to  the
emergence of CACSD tools in more detail, starting with technological developments and then moving on to
user interface aspects. The aim is to understand the current state-of-the-art by examining the historical context
in which these tools have been developed.
