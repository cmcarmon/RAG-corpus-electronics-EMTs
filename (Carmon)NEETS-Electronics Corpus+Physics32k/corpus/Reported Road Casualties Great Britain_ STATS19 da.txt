The police collect details of all incidents which they attend or become aware of within 30 days which occur on the highway in which one or more person is killed or injured and involving one or more vehicles using the STATS19 data collection system.
STATS19 is the reference number for the police form used to record incidents. STATS20 describes how to complete the form giving examples of how to correctly record different situations. STATS21 describes how the STATS19 data should be checked for accuracy.
Additional information for RCGB is gathered from death registrations, coroners' reports and traffic and vehicle registrations.
STATS19 data are used in European Union road safety studies.
