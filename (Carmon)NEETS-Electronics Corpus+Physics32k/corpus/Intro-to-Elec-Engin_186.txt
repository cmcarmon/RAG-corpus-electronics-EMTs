A word of caution is appropriate if this is the student’s ﬁrst experience with simulation. Just as the
proliferation of calculators did not eliminate the need to understand the theory of mathematics,
circuit simulation programs do not eliminate the need to understand circuit theory. However,
computer-aided tools can free the engineer from tedious calculations, thereby freeing more time
for doing the kind of creative work a computer cannot do.
