Common Collector Ampliﬁer
The ﬁnal canonic cell of linear BJT ampliﬁers is the common collector ampliﬁer. The ac schematic diagram of
this stage, which is often referred to as an emitter follower, is given in Fig. 28.18(a). In emitter followers, the
input signal is applied to the base, and the resultant small signal output voltage is extracted at the transistor
emitter.
