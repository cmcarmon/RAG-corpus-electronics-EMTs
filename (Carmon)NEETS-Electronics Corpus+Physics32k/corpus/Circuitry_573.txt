When  the  voltage  at  the  threshold  input  (pin-6) 
exceeds two-thirds of the supply voltage the output 
of the upper comparator, IC1, will change state and 
the  bistable  will  become  reset  due  to  voltage 
transition that appears at R. This, in turn, will make 
the inverted Q output go high, turning TR1 at the 
same time. Due to the inverting action of the buffer, 
IC4, the final output (pin-3) will go low.
