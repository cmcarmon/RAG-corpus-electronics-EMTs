To illustrate the communication procedure, consider the
guidance module that requires altitude information. It sub-
scribes to this data from the software substrate. When
subscribing, it declares the data that it needs and the rate at
which it must receive the data. The GPS and the altimeter both
publish this data, so the middleware must have a strategy for
deciding which of these sensors to use in retrieving data. One
strategy is to give both sensors weight values (Pardo-Castellote
et al., 1999). The middleware sends data to the subscriber from
the publisher that has a higher weight. These weights can be
changed in real-time by the middleware so that alternate
sensors can be used based on current ﬂight conditions. The
subscribers themselves are not changed in this process. In a
similar manner, an additional sensor might be added to the
system with a prescribed weight. If that weight is higher than
the existing publishers of that data, the subscribers will receive
the data from the new component. Note that this is a simpli-
ﬁed example; in reality, there is usually a ﬁltering module
between the sensors and controllers that may be used to fuse
sensor data. This module may be integrated as a separate com-
ponent that both publishes and subscribes to data.
