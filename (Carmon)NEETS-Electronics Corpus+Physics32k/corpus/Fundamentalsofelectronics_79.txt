The subtlest interconnection conﬁguration has a system’s output also contributing to its input. Engineers
would say the output is “fed back” to the input through system 2, hence the terminology. The mathematical
statement of the feedback interconnection (Figure 2.12) is that the feed-forward system produces the output:
y (t) = S1 [e (t)]. The input e (t) equals the input signal minus the output of some other system’s output to
y (t): e (t) = x (t) − S2 [y (t)]. Feedback systems are omnipresent in control problems, with the error signal
used to adjust the output to achieve some condition deﬁned by the input (controlling) signal. For example,
in a car’s cruise control system, x (t) is a constant representing what speed you want, and y (t) is the car’s
speed as measured by a speedometer. In this application, system 2 is the identity system (output equals
input).
2.6 Simple Systems9
Systems manipulate signals, creating output signals derived from their inputs. Why the following are cate-
gorized as “simple” will only become evident towards the end of the course.
2.6.1 Sources
Sources produce signals without having input. We like to think of these as having controllable parameters,
like amplitude and frequency. Examples would be oscillators that produce periodic signals like sinusoids and
square waves and noise generators that yield signals with erratic waveforms (more about noise subsequently).
Simply writing an expression for the signals they produce speciﬁes sources. A sine wave generator might
be speciﬁed by y (t) = A sin (2πf0t) u(t), which says that the source was turned on at t = 0 to produce a
sinusoid of amplitude A and frequency f0.
2.6.2 Ampliﬁers
An ampliﬁer (Figure 2.13) multiplies its input by a constant known as the ampliﬁer gain.
