The Parshall Flume acts essentially as a constriction, a downward step, and then an expansion: the upstream section is uniformly converging and flat, the throat is a short parallel section that slopes downward, and the downstream section is uniformly diverging and slopes upward to an ending elevation that is less than the upstream starting elevation. The width of the throat determines the flume size; 22 standardized sizes have been developed, ranging from 1 in. to 50 ft. (0.005 ft3/s to 3,280 ft3/s).
There are two conditions of flow that can occur in a Parshall Flume: free flow and submerged flow. When free flow conditions exist, the user only needs to collect one head measurement (Ha, the primary point of measurement) to determine the discharge. For submerged flow a secondary head measurement (Hb) is required to determine the flume is submerged and the degree of submergence.
The primary point of measurement (Ha) is located in the inlet of the flume, two-thirds of the length of the converging section from the flume crest. The secondary point of measurement (Hb) is located in the throat of the flume.
A hydraulic jump occurs downstream of the flume for free flow conditions. As the flume becomes submerged, the hydraulic jump diminishes and ultimately disappears as the downstream conditions increasingly restrict the flow out of the flume.

The free-flow discharge can be summarized as




Q
=
C

H

a


n




{\displaystyle Q=CH_{a}^{n}}

Where
Q is flow rate
C is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
Ha is the head at the primary point of measurement
n varies with flume size (e.g. 1.55 for a 1-inch flume)
