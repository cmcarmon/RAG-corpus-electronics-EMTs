A linear phase characteristic ensures that a ﬁlter has a constant group delay independent of frequency. Thus,
all  frequency  components  in  the  signal  are  delayed  by  the  same  amount,  and  the  only  signal  distortion
introduced is that imposed by the ﬁlter’s frequency-selective characteristics. Since a FIR ﬁlter can only approx-
imate a desired frequency-selective characteristic, some measures of the accuracy of approximation are needed
to  describe  the  quality  of  the  design.  These  are  the  passband  ripple dp,  the  stopband  attenuation d s,  and  the
transition  bandwidth  Dw.  These  quantities  are  illustrated  in  Fig. 14.10  for  a  prototype  low-pass  ﬁlter.  The
passband ripple gives the maximum deviation from the desired amplitude (typically unity) in the region where
the input signal spectral components are desired to be passed unattenuated. The stopband attenuation gives
the maximum deviation from zero in the region where the input signal spectral components are desired to be
blocked. The transition bandwidth gives the width of the spectral region in which the frequency characteristics
