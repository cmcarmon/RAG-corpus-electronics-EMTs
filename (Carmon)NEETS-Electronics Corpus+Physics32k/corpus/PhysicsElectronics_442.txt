If the collector, emitter, and base of an NPN transistor are shorted together as shown in
ﬁgure 5.2a, the diﬀusion process described earlier for diodes results in the formation of two
depletion regions that surround the base as shown. The diﬀusion of negative carriers into
the base and positive carriers out of the base results in a relative electric potential as shown
in ﬁgure 5.2b.
