RGF-distance compares the frequencies of the appearance of all 3-5-node graphlets in two networks. Let Ni(G) be the number of graphlets of type



i


{\displaystyle i}
(



i

}


{\displaystyle i\in \{1,\ldots ,29\}}
) in network G, and let



T

G

=

∑

{\displaystyle T(G)=\sum _{i=1}^{29}N_{i}(G)}
be the total number of graphlets of G. The "similarity" between two graphs should be independent of the total number of nodes or edges, and should depend only upon the differences between relative frequencies of graphlets. Thus, relative graphlet frequency distance D(G,H) between two graphs G and H is defined as:



D

H
)

{\displaystyle F_{i}(G)=-\log(N_{i}(G)/T(G))}
. The logarithm of the graphlet frequency is used because frequencies of different graphlets can differ by several orders of magnitude and the distance measure should not be entirely dominated by the most frequent graphlets.
