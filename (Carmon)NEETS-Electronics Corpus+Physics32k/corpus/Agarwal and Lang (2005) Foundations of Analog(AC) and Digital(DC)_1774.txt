Prior to a falling transient, vTH is assumed to equal 5.0 V for a long time. Since the
capacitor and inductor, respectively, behave as an open circuit and a short circuit after
long periods of time, the circuit states will have settled to vC = 5.0 V and iL = 0 prior to
the transient. These are then the initial states for the falling transient. For simplicity, we
will assume that the falling transient begins at t = 0. Therefore, the varying component
of the circuit states begin a falling transient from
