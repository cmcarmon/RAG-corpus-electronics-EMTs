meter and reconnect the resistor to the 
LEDs. Then disconnect the positive lead 
of LED1 from the resistor. Insert the mul-
timeter leads into the circuit, as shown 
in the photo on the left in Figure 4-6.  
Because the multimeter is in series with 
LED1, you’re measuring the current 
that flows through LED1. This current is 
labeled I1 (refer to Figure 4-3).
