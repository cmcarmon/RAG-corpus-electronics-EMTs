To analyze the operation of the circuit in view (A), assume that the amplifier is a common-emitter 
configuration. The signal on the collector (M) is 180 degrees out of phase with the signal (input) on the 
base (R). For the circuit to produce regenerative feedback, the RC network must provide a 180-degree 
phase shift of the collector signal. When power is applied to the circuit, a noise voltage (noise contains 
many different frequencies) will appear on the collector. This noise signal is represented by vector LM in 
view (B). As the signal couples through C1 and across R1 (view (A)), a phase shift occurs. The voltage 
across R1 (E R1), represented by vector LN, has been shifted in phase (about 60 degrees) and reduced in 
amplitude. The signal at point N (view (A)) is then coupled to the next RC section (R2 and C2). Using the 
same size resistor and capacitor as before will cause another 60-degree phase shift to take place. The 
signal at point P is the voltage across R2, represented by vector LP. Now the signal at point P has been 
shifted about 120 degrees and its amplitude is reduced still further. The same actions occur for the last 
section (R3 and C3). This signal experiences another 60-degree phase shift and has further amplitude 
reduction. The signal at point R (ER3) has been shifted 180 degrees and is represented by vector LR.
