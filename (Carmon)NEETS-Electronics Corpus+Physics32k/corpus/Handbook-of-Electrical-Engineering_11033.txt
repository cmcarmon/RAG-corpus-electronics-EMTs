The Normal EEG
In the normal resting adult, the EEG displays a ï¬‚uctuating
electrical activity having a dominant frequency of about
10  Hz  and  an  amplitude  in  the  range  of  20  to  200 mV.
This  activity  is  called  the  alpha  rhythm  and  ranges  in
frequency from about 8 to 12 Hz, being most prominent
in the occipital and parietal areas. It may occupy as much
as  half  the  record.  The  alpha  rhythm  increases  in  fre-
quency with age from birth and attains its adult form by
about 15 to 20 years. The alpha rhythm is most prominent
when the eyes are closed and in the absence of concen-
tration. Opening the eyes, engaging in patterned vision, or performing such cerebral activity as mental arithmetic
diminishes or abolishes the alpha rhythm. Figure 113.20 presents a good example of this phenomenon.
