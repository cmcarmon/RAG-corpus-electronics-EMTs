Determining the cutoff wavelength of a single mode fiber involves finding the wavelength above
which the power transmitted through the fiber decreased abruptly. This power decrease occurs when the
second-order mode propagating in the fiber is cut off. The cutoff wavelength of single mode fibers
depends on the fiber length and bend conditions. The effects of length and bending are different on
different fibers depending on whether they are matched-clad or depressed-clad in design. The cutoff
wavelength of matched-clad fibers is more sensitive to bends than the cutoff wavelength of depressed-
clad fibers. The cutoff wavelength of depressed-clad fibers is more sensitive to length than the cutoff
wavelength of matched-clad fibers.
