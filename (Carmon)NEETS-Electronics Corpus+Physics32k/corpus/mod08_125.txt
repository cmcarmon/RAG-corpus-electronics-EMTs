The feedback network in this amplifier is made up of R2 and C2. The value of C2 should be large so 
that the capacitive reactance (X C) will be low and the capacitor will couple the signal easily. (This is also 
the case with the input and output coupling capacitors C1 and C3.) The resistive value of R2 should be 
large to limit the amount of feedback signal and to ensure that the majority of the output signal goes on to 
the next stage through C3.
