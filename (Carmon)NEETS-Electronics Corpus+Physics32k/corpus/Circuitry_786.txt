Pole-zero analysis 
 
The pole-zero analysis  facility computes the poles 
and/or  zeros 
transfer 
function.    The  program  first  computes  the  DC 
operating point and then determines the linearized, 
small-signal models for all the non-linear devices in 
the  circuit.    This  circuit  is  then  used  to  find  the 
poles and zeros of the transfer function.
