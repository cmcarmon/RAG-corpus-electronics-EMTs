pointing (Alewine et al., 1992). Full checkpointing maintains
snapshots of the entire state of the system (essentially all register,
cache, and memory contents) at the checkpoints, whereas in-
cremental checkpointing maintains only the changes to the state
from the immediately preceding checkpoint (e.g., contents of
registers written between the checkpoints). Rollback in full
checkpointing schemes involves setting the current state to be
the desired checkpointed state, while in incremental check-
pointing, rollback involves undoing or backing out of the state
changes made after the desired checkpointed state. We will
focus on incremental checkpointing in the discussion of hard-
ware microrollback in the rest of this section.
