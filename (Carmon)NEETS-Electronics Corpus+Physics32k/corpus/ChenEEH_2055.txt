State Functions, Predicates, and Transitions
A state function is an expression built from values, state
variables, rigid function, and predicate symbols. For example,
[p(c) þ 1] is a state function, where c and 1 are values, p is a
state variable, and þ is a rigid function symbol. Since the
meanings of rigid symbols are not affected by any state, for
any given state M , M[p(c) þ 1] ¼ M[p(c)] þ 1.
