An important utilization of robotics has traditionally been in manufacturing operations. By their very design
and reprogrammable features, robots have enhanced the capabilities for ﬂexibility in automation. Robot appli-
cations initially focused on replacing repetitive, boring, and hazardous manual tasks. Such initial applications
required  minimal  control,  programming,  or  sensory  capability  and  have  evolved  to  applications  that  use
enhanced controller designs and sophisticated sensory capability. The ﬁrst recorded commercial application of
an industrial robot was at the Ford Motor Company in 1961 that used a Unimate robot to unload a die-casting
machine.  Since  then,  robots  have  been  used  in  various  manufacturing  processes,  fabrication,  and  assembly
operations. Current issues relate to the degree of integration with the total manufacturing system and to the
degree of autonomy and/or complexity one wishes to implement for a robotic system. In potential applications,
it is necessary to determine the degree of sophistication that one wishes to implement coupled with a detailed
economic analysis. The focus in this section is to present a practical implementation strategy for robots within
a  manufacturing  environment,  to  review  particular  applications,  and  to  discuss  issues  relevant  to  enhancing
robot applications on the manufacturing shop ﬂoor. Such issues include sensors and their integration within
an intelligent control system, the development of grippers for enhanced dexterity, and integration topics within
a ﬂexible cellular manufacturing system.
