The inverse second, reciprocal second, or per second (s−1) is a unit of frequency, defined as the multiplicative inverse of the second (a unit of time). It is dimensionally equivalent to:
the unit hertz – the SI unit for cycles per second
the unit becquerel – the SI unit for aperiodic or stochastic radionuclide events per second
the unit baud – the unit for symbol rate over a communication link
strain rate – the velocity gradient (comprising the shear rate and directional expansion rate) of a fluid or solid
It also provides the denominator for temporal rates, such as that of angular frequency in radians per second.
