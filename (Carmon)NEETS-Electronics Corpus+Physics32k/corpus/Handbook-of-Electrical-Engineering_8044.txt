Universal  Product  Code. The  use  of  the  Universal  Product  Code  (UPC)  has  enabled  the  development  of
intelligent POS terminals which can “read’’ the UPC symbol and determine the identity of the item. The UPC
symbol consists of ten decimal digits, split into two ﬁelds of ﬁve digits each. Each digit is encoded using a 7-bit
binary number, represented by a group of 7 dark (binary 1) and light (binary 0) bars. The ﬁve left-hand digits
are  encoded  using  odd  parity  and  the  right-hand  digits  are  encoded  using  even  parity.  This  allows  correct
recognition of the symbol, independent of its orientation.
