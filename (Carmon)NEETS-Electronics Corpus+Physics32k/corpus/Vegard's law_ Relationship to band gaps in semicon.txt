In many binary semiconducting systems, the band gap in semiconductors is approximately a linear function of the lattice parameter. Therefore, if the lattice parameter of a semiconducting system follows Vegard's law, one can also write a linear relationship between the band gap and composition. Using InPxAs(1-x) as before, the band gap energy,






E

g






{\displaystyle {\mathit {E_{g}}}}
, can be written as:







E

I

{\displaystyle {\mathit {E_{g,\mathrm {InPAs} }}}={\mathit {x}}{\mathit {E_{g,\mathrm {InP} }}}+(1-{\mathit {x}}){\mathit {E_{g,\mathrm {InAs} }}}}

Sometimes, the linear interpolation between the band gap energies is not accurate enough, and a second term to account for the curvature of the band gap energies as a function of composition is added. This curvature correction is characterized by the bowing parameter, b:
