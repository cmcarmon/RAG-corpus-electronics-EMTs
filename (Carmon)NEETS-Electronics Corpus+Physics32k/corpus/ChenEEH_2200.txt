In this chapter, the fundamental relationship between source
and ﬁeld is between the electric charge q (measured in cou-
lombs) and the electric ﬂux density D (measured in coulombs
per meter squared) because that relationship has the form of a
conservation law. The electric ﬁeld E (measured in volts per
meter) is introduced with the concept of the electrostatic
potential F (measured in volts) as the quantity involved in
the dynamics of electrostatic systems (i.e., their interaction
forces and energies). In this way, e (measured in farads per
meter), the permittivity of the material medium through
which the ﬂux traverses, appears as a proportionality constant
that gauges the amount of energy stored in a given electrostatic
system. Capacitance C (measured in farads) is then a purely
geometric expression of the arrangement of that energy inside
the system. The concepts of electrostatics are extended to the
