This assumes that all addend bits are presented to the adder simultaneously. It is important to note that in the
least signiﬁcant full adder, tpd represents the time to compute c1 from x0 and y0 and in the most signiﬁcant full
adder the time to compute sn–1 after cn–1 is received. In the intermediate stages, tpd is the time needed to compute
ci+l  from  ci.  The  propagation  delay  is  approximately  equal  to  the  delay  of  a  three-level  logic  circuit  which  is
consistent with the realization of a full adder given in Fig. 81.48.
