A random process X(t, s) can be viewed as a function of two
variables: sample space s, and time t. We show N sample
functions of time, {Xk(t )} (see Figure 1.1). Each of the sample
functions can be considered as the output of a different noise
generator. For a Ô¨Åxed sample point sk, the graph of the func-
tion X(t , sk) versus time t is called a realization or sample
function of the random process. To simplify the notation, we
denote this sample function as:
