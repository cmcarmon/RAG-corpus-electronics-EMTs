DQDB
The DQDB forms the basis of the 
for MANs. DQDB is descended from the earlier QPSX,
which was developed at the University of Western Australia and Telecom Australia. DQDB uses two unidirec-
tional  linear  ﬁber-optic  buses.  Stations  are  connected  to  both  buses.  Through  the  clever  use  of  counters  the
DQDB protocol provides approximate ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out (FIFO) service to arriving packets. There are no collisions
in DQDB, so utilization can approach 100%. Bus speeds of 150 Mbps are possible.
