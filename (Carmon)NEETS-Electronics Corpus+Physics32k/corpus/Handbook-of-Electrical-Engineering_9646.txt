In the micro-kernel architecture shown in Fig. 96.5, notice that subsystems traditionally within the operating
system are now at the same level as an application program. An application program wishing to, for example,
open a ﬁle makes its request to the ﬁle system program, rather than the micro-kernel. The ﬁle system may call
upon other OS subsystems or on the micro-kernel to perform an operation.
