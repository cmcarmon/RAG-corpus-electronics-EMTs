As long as C2 has no discharge path, the voltage across its terminals increases with each successive 
step until it is equal in amplitude to the applied pulse. The voltage across C2 could be applied to a 
blocking-oscillator circuit to cause the oscillator to pulse after a certain amount of voltage is applied to it.
