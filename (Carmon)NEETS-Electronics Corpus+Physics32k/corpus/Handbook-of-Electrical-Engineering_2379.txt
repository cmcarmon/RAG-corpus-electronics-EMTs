The  huge  electronics  and  computer  industries  exist  primarily  because  of  the  unique  electrical  properties  of
semiconductor materials, such as Si and GaAs. These materials usually contain impurities and defects in their
crystal  lattices;  such  entities  can  act  as  donors  and  acceptors,  and  can  strongly  inﬂuence  the  electrical  and
optical properties of the charge carriers. Thus, it is extremely important to be able to measure the concentration
and mobility of these carriers, and the concentrations and energies of the donors and acceptors. All of these
quantities can, in principle, be determined by measurement and analysis of the temperature-dependent resis-
tivity and Hall effect. On the simplest level, Hall-effect measurements require only a current source, a voltmeter,
and a modest-sized magnet. However, the addition of temperature-control equipment and computer analysis
produce  a  much  more  powerful  instrument  that  can  accurately  measure  concentrations  over  a  range  104  to
1020 cm–3. Many commercial instruments are available for such measurements; this chapter section reveals how
to make full use of the versatility of the technique.
