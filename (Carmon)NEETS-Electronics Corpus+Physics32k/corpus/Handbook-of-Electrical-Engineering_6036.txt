The losses in the power system are a function of the generation pattern, and they are taken into account by
multiplying  the  generator  incremental  costs  by  the  appropriate  penalty  factors.  The  penalty  factor  for  each
generator  is  a  reï¬‚ection  of  the  sensitivity  of  that  generator  to  system  losses,  and  these  sensitivities  can  be
obtained from the transmission loss factors (Section 67.6).
