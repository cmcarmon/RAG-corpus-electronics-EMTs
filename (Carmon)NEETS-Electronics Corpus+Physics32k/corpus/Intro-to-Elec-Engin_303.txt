where ωCHP = ωC1 is the cutoff frequency of the high-pass ﬁlter and ωCLP = ωC2 is the cutoff
frequency of the low-pass ﬁlter.
In order to design a bandpass ﬁlter with a passband gain of 0 dB and cutoff frequencies of
ωC1 = 10 rad/s and ωC2 = 50 rad/s, with the stopband gains of less than −20 dB at 2 rad/s and
250 rad/s, one has chosen the following low-pass and high-pass transfer functions:
