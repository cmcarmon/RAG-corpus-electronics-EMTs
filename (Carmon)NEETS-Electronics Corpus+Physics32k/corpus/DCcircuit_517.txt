Production printed circuit boards have traces of copper laid down on the phenolic or ﬁber-
glass substrate material to form pre-engineered connection pathways which function as wires
in a circuit. An example of such a board is shown here, this unit actually a ”power supply”
circuit designed to take 120 volt alternating current (AC) power from a household wall socket
and transform it into low-voltage direct current (DC). A resistor appears on this board, the
ﬁfth component counting up from the bottom, located in the middle-right area of the board.
