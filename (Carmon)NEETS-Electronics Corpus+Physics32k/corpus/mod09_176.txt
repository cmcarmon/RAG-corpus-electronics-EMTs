The capacitance of the capacitor must be such that its reactance will offer little opposition to 
frequencies above a definite value, and great opposition to frequencies below this value. By combining 
the series inductance and bypass capacitance, as shown in view (C), the simplest type of low-pass filter is 
obtained. At point P, a much higher opposition is offered to the low frequencies by the capacitor than by 
the inductor, and most of the low-frequency current takes the path of least opposition. On the other hand,
