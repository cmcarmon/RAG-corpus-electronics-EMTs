A typical frequency synthesizer consists of a bank of oscillators producing different fixed
frequencies. The outputs of a relatively few fixed oscillators can be mixed in various combinations to
produce a wide range of frequencies. In mti systems the selected oscillator frequencies are mixed with a
coherent oscillator frequency to provide a stable reference for the mti circuits. The frequency synthesizer
also produces the local oscillator signals for the receiver system. Because the transmitted pulse changes
frequency on each transmission, the local oscillator signal to the receiver must also change and be
included in the transmitted frequency. A system of this type is frequency-programmed by select gates
from the synchronizer.
