Heat is provided by turning on a relay that supplies power to a heater coil. The on-off signal to the relay can
be supplied by 1 bit of an output port of the microprocessor (typically the port would be 8 bits wide). A second
bit of the port can be used to turn a fan on and off to supply cooling air to the chamber. An analog-to-digital
(A/D) converter is employed to convert the ampliÔ¨Åed thermocouple signal to a digital word that is then supplied
to the input port of the microprocessor. The program being executed by the microprocessor reads the temper-
ature data supplied to the input port and compares the binary number representing the temperature to a binary
