Intrinsic photoconduction effect is when a photon with energy hu, which is greater than the bandgap energy,
excites an electron from the valence band into the conduction band, creating a holeâ€“electron pair. This increases
the conductivity of the material. The spectral response of this type of detector is governed by the bandgap of
the semiconductor.
