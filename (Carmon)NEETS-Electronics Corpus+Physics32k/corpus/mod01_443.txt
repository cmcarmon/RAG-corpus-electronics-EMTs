Before you study a schematic representation of the flashlight, it is necessary to define certain terms.
The LOAD is any device through which an electrical current flows and which changes this electrical
energy into a more useful form. Some common examples of loads are a lightbulb, which changes
electrical energy to light energy; an electric motor, which changes electrical energy into mechanical
energy; and the speaker in a radio, which changes electrical energy into sound. The SOURCE is the
device which furnishes the electrical energy used by the load. It may consist of a simple dry cell (as in a
flashlight), a storage battery (as in an automobile), or a power supply (such as a battery charger). The
SWITCH, which permits control of the electrical device, interrupts the current delivered to the load.
