We have used the above more complicated procedure to
prepare the reader for synthesis of two-ports with ﬁnite trans-
fer zeros. We could have achieved the same by dividing the
numerator by the denominator in each of the steps. In fact, if
the reader knows expansions into continued fractions, he or
she should try it on 1=Z1. It is the fastest way for the removal
of transfer zeros at inﬁnity.
