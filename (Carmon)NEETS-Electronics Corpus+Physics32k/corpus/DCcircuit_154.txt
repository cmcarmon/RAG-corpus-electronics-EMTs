Because the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in any circuit is so regular,
we can reliably control any variable in a circuit simply by controlling the other two. Perhaps
the easiest variable in any circuit to control is its resistance. This can be done by changing the
material, size, and shape of its conductive components (remember how the thin metal Ô¨Ålament
of a lamp created more electrical resistance than a thick wire?).
