The inductance and resistance of a coil form a series RL circuit. The voltage drop across this 
inductance and resistance must be added to obtain the voltage waveform required to produce a linear rise 
in current. A linear rise of current produces a linear rise of voltage across the resistance of the coil and a 
constant voltage drop across the inductance of the coil.
