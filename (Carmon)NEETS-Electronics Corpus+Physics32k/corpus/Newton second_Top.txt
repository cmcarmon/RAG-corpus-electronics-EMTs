The newton second (also newton-second, symbol Ns or N·s) is the derived SI unit of impulse. It is dimensionally equivalent to the momentum unit kilogram metre per second (kg·m/s). One newton second corresponds to a one-newton force applied for one second.

It can be used to identify the resultant velocity of a mass if a force accelerates the mass for a specific time interval.
