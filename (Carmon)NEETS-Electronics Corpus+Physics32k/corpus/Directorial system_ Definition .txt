A Directorial System is a system of government in which the executive power is split a select number of individuals who are, or de facto are, equals. Some have argued that diarchies such as Andorra are directorial as executive power is held between more than one person. Israel's Parliamentary System, a codified, streamlined variant of the Westminster System under which executive power is vested directly in the Multi-person Cabinet, as opposed to the President acting on the advice of the Cabinet in a normal Westminster System, can be seen as semi-directorial.
