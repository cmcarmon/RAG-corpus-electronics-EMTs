Consider the example burning of magnesium ribbon (Mg). When magnesium burns, it combines with oxygen (O2) from the air to form magnesium oxide (MgO) according to the following equation:
2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)
Magnesium oxide is an ionic compound containing Mg2+ and O2− ions whereas Mg(s) and O2(g) are elements with no charges. The Mg(s) with zero charge gains a +2 charge going from the reactant side to product side, and the O2(g) with zero charge gains a -2 charge. This is because when Mg(s) becomes Mg2+, it loses 2 electrons. Since there are 2 Mg on left side, a total of 4 electrons are lost according to the following oxidation half reaction:
2Mg(s) → 2Mg2+ + 4e−
On the other hand, O2 was reduced: its oxidation state goes from 0 to -2. Thus, a reduction half-reaction can be written for the O2 as it gains 4 electrons:
O2(g) + 4e− → 2O2−
The overall reaction is the sum of both half-reactions:
2Mg(s) + O2(g) + 4e− →2Mg2+ + 2O2− + 4e−
When chemical reaction, especially, redox reaction takes place, we do not see the electrons as they appear and disappear during the course of the reaction. What we see is the reactants (starting material) and end products. Due to this, electrons appearing on both sides of the equation are canceled. After canceling, the equation is re-written as
2Mg(s) + O2(g) →2Mg2+ + 2O2−
Two ions, positive (Mg2+) and negative (O2−) exist on product side and they combine immediately to form a compound magnesium oxide (MgO) due to their opposite charges (electrostatic attraction). In any given oxidation-reduction reaction, there are two half-reactions – oxidation half- reaction and reduction half-reaction. The sum of these two half-reactions is the oxidation- reduction reaction.
