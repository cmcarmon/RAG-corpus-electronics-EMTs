The microstrip antenna is a relatively modern invention. It
was invented to allow convenient integration of an antenna
and other driving circuitry of a communication system on a
common printed-circuit board or a semiconductor chip
(Carver and Mink, 1981; Pozar, 1992). Besides other resulting
advantages, the integrated-circuit technology for the antenna
fabrication allowed high dimensional accuracy, which was

methods. The geometry of a microstrip antenna consists of a
dielectric substrate of certain thickness d, having a complete
metalization on one of its surfaces and of a metal ‘‘patch’’ on
the other side. The substrate is usually thin (d  l). The metal
patch on the front surface can have various shapes, although a
rectangular shape, as shown in Figure 6.17, is commonly used.
The antenna may be excited using various methods (Pozar,
1992; Pozar and Schawbert, 1995). One common approach is
to feed from a microstrip line, connecting the microstrip
antenna at the center of one of its edges. The microstrip line
