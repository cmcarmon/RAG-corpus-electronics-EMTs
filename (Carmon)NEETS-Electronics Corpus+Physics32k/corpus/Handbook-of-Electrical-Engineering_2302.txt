td is thus current dependent. At small ID the rdCj product is predominant. For high-speed operation rdCj must
be kept much smaller than tF. This is achieved by a large operating current ID. The diode behaves to a ﬁrst
approximation as a frequency-dependent element. In the reverse operation, the diode behaves as a high ohmic
resistor Rp » VR/IG in parallel with the capacitor Cj. In forward small-signal operation, the diode behaves as a
resistor rd in parallel with the capacitors Cj and Cd (Rp is neglected). Thus, the diode is in a ﬁrst approximation,
a low-pass network.
