An up slope runway will allow an aircraft to land in a shorter distance. A down slope runway will require a greater landing distance. It will take longer for the aeroplane to touch down from 50 ft above the runway threshold, as the runway is falling away beneath the aeroplane and of course braking while going downhill is not as effective as on a level or up slope runway.
