The electromagnetic energy of light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Light and similar forms
of radiation are made up of moving electric and magnetic forces. A simple example of motion similar to
these radiation waves can be made by dropping a pebble into a pool of water. In this example, the water is
not actually being moved by the outward motion of the wave, but rather by the up-and-down motion of
the water. The up-and-down motion is transverse, or at right angles, to the outward motion of the waves.
This type of wave motion is called transverse-wave motion. The transverse waves spread out in
expanding circles until they reach the edge of the pool, in much the same manner as the transverse waves
of light spread from the sun. However, the waves in the pool are very slow and clumsy in comparison
with light, which travels approximately 186,000 miles per second.
