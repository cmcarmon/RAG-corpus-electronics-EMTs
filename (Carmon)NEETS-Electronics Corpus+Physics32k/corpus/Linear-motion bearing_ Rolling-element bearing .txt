A rolling-element bearing is generally composed of a sleeve-like outer ring and several rows of balls retained by cages. The cages were originally machined from solid metal and were quickly replaced by stampings. It features smooth motion, low friction, high rigidity and long life. They are economical, and easy to maintain and replace. Thomson (currently owned by Danaher) is generally given credit for first producing [what is now known as] a linear ball bearing.
Rolling-element bearings can only run on hardened steel or stainless steel shafting (raceways).
Rolling-element bearings are more rigid than plain bearings.
Rolling-element bearings do not handle contamination well and require seals.
Rolling-element bearings require lubrication.
Rolling-element bearings are manufactured in two forms: ball bearing slides and roller slides.
