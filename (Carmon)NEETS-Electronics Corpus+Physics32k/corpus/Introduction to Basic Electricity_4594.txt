Multiplexers handle two basic types of data: analog 
and digital. For analog applications, multiplexers are 
built of relays and transistor switches. For digital appli-
cations, multiplexers are built from standard logic gates.
Digital multiplexers allow digital data from sev-
eral individual sources to be routed through a com-
mon line for transmission to a common destination. 
A basic multiplexer has several input lines with a 
single  output line. The input lines are activated by data 
 selection input that identifies the line the data are to 
be received on. Figure 45-13 shows the logic circuit for 
an eight-input multiplexer. Notice that there are three 
 input-control lines, labeled A, B, and C. Any of the 
eight input lines can be selected by the proper expres-
sion of the input-control line. The symbol used to rep-
resent a digital multiplexer is shown in Figure 45-14.
