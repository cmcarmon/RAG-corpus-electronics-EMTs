A single-vehicle collision is when a single road vehicle has a collision without involving any other vehicle.
They usually have similar root causes as head-on collisions, but no other vehicle happened to be in the path of the vehicle leaving its lane. Severe collisions of this type can happen on motorways, since speeds are extra high, increasing the severity.
