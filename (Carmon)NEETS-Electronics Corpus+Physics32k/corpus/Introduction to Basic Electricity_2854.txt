A transformer that produces a secondary voltage 
less than its primary voltage is called a step-down	
transformer. The amount the voltage is stepped 
down is determined by the turns ratio. In a step-down 
transformer, the turns ratio is always less than 1.
EXamPlE:	 A transformer has 500 turns on the pri-
mary and 100 turns on the secondary. If 120 volts AC 
are applied across the primary, what is the voltage in-
duced in the secondary?
