The wiper contact is the left-facing arrow symbol drawn in the middle of the vertical resistor
element. As it is moved up, it contacts the resistive strip closer to terminal 1 and further away
from terminal 2, lowering resistance to terminal 1 and raising resistance to terminal 2. As it is
moved down, the opposite effect results. The resistance as measured between terminals 1 and
2 is constant for any wiper position.
