Recall that the propagation delay results from the finite amount of time
required for the output to transition from a given valid output voltage level to
another when the input to the circuit transitions. The slower transition at the
output is attributable to RC effects. Figure 10.18 replaces the inverters with
their internal circuits comprising MOSFETs and resistors. Figure 10.19 further
replaces the MOSFETs with their SRC circuit model when vIN1 applied to the
inverter A corresponds to a logical 1. For this vIN1, the MOSFET in inverter A
will be on, and the MOSFET in inverter B will be off. Similarly, Figure 10.20
shows the circuit model when vIN1 applied to inverter A corresponds to a
logical 0. For this vIN1, the MOSFET in inverter A will be off, and the MOSFET
in inverter B will be on. Thus, when alternating logical 1’s and 0’s are applied
to the input to the inverter pair, and the inverters are allowed to reach steady
state after each transition, the equivalent circuit model alternates between the
two circuits in Figures 10.19 and 10.20.
