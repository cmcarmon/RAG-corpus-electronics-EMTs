Even after the dimension of the data set has been reduced,
the data set is still almost always fairly high-dimensional. There
have been contributions from three major research commu-
nities in this direction: computational geometry, database
management, and pattern recognition. The history of multi-
dimensional
indexing techniques can be tracked back to
middle 1970s when cell methods, quadtree and k-d tree were
ﬁrst introduced. However, their performance was far from
satisfactory. Pushed by the then urgent demand of spatial
indexing from GIS and CAD systems, Guttman proposed the
R-tree indexing structure in 1984. Some good reviews of vari-
ous indexing techniques in the context of image retrieval can
be found in (White and Jain, 1996). Khokhar et al. (1999) have
dealt with the feature vector formation and its efﬁcient index-
ing as one problem and suggest a solution in which query
response time is relatively independent of the database size.
