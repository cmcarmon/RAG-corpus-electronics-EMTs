The clearance to ground is determined by the induced
electric Ô¨Åeld with a magnitude that reduces with distance
from the conductor. The clearances of the line from the
tower are dependent on overvoltage produced by lightning
surges and switching events. Transmission lines at 230 kV and
below are governed by lightning overvoltages, whereas for lines
at 345 kV and above, overvoltage produced by switching surges
is the determining factor.
