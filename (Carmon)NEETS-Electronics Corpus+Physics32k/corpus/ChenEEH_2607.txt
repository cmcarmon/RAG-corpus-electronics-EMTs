High-pass ﬁlters are complementary to low-pass ﬁlters. From
an equivalent network point of view, the design of a high-pass
network is quite straightforward as it is sufﬁcient to inter-
change the topological position of inductors and capacitors
of the low-pass ﬁlter. Thus, high-pass ﬁlters consist of a series
capacitor elements with joint shunt inductors. As a matter of
fact, a metallic waveguide itself is a natural high-pass ﬁlter
because the signal
is completely rejected below the cutoff
frequency of the guide. Figure 7.40 shows two representative
examples of stopband ﬁlters made of planar elements and
waveguide sections, respectively.
