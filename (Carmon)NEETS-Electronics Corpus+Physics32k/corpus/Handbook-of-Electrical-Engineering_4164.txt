The horizontal component of the electric ﬁeld has not been as well studied or characterized as the vertical.
For the case of a ﬁnite-conducting earth and lightning beyond a few kilometers, Thomson et al. [1988] give
wideband measurements of the three perpendicular components of the electric ﬁeld about 1 m above ground
level. An example is shown in Fig. 40.22. The horizontal ﬁeld waveshapes are more impulsive and vary on a
faster time scale than their associated vertical electric ﬁeld waveshapes. In fact, the horizontal ﬁeld appears to
be a crude derivative of the vertical. The peak amplitudes of the horizontal electric ﬁelds are on the order of
30 times smaller than those of the vertical ﬁelds for ground conductivities of the order of 10-2 mho/m, this
ratio being roughly proportional to the square root of the ground conductivity. The horizontal ﬁeld, although
considerably smaller for distant lightning, can be as important as the vertical electric ﬁeld in inducing voltages
on an overhead horizontal wire because of the greater horizontal extent of the wire relative to its height above
ground, a fact well established by recent research, whereas in the earlier literature on power line coupling, for
example, only the vertical ﬁeld was considered to be important.
