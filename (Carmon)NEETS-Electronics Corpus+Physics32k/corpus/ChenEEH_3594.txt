Most digital Ô¨Ålters can be described by difference equations
that are suitable for implementation in digital machines. It is
important to guarantee that the difference equation represents
a system that is linear, time-invariant, and causal. This is
guaranteed if the auxiliary conditions for the underlying dif-
ference equation correspond to its initial conditions, and the
system is initially relaxed.
