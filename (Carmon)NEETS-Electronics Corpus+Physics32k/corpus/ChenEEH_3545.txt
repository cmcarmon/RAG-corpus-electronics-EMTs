The frequency response of a discrete-time system is deﬁned
as the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) of its impulse
response h[n], as shown in equation 1.36. If an input x[n] is
applied to the system, the output is the convolution sum
y[n] ¼ x[n]  h[n]. From the property of the DTFT of convo-
lution sums discussed above, the DTFT, Y (ejv), of the output,
