The use of equivalent weights in general chemistry has largely been superseded by the use of molar masses. Equivalent weights may be calculated from molar masses if the chemistry of the substance is well known:
sulfuric acid has a molar mass of 98.078(5) g mol−1, and supplies two moles of hydrogen ions per mole of sulfuric acid, so its equivalent weight is 98.078(5) g mol−1/2 eq mol−1 = 49.039(3) g eq−1.
potassium permanganate has a molar mass of 158.034(1) g mol−1, and reacts with five moles of electrons per mole of potassium permanganate, so its equivalent weight is 158.034(1) g mol−1/5 eq mol−1 = 31.6068(3) g eq−1.
Historically, the equivalent weights of the elements were often determined by studying their reactions with oxygen. For example, 50 g of zinc will react with oxygen to produce 62.24 g of zinc oxide, implying that the zinc has reacted with 12.24 g of oxygen (from the Law of conservation of mass): the equivalent weight of zinc is the mass which will react with eight grams of oxygen, hence 50 g × 8 g/12.24 g = 32.7 g.
