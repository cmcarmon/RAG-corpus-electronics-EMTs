Parallel  conÔ¨Åguration  can  be  either  radial-connected  [Fig. 61.10(a)]  or  mesh-connected  [Fig. 61.10(b)].  In  a
parallel-connected multiterminal dc system, all converters operate at the same nominal dc voltage, similar to
ac  system  interconnections.  In  this  operation,  one  converter  determines  the  operating  voltage,  and  all  other
terminals operate in a current-controlling mode.
