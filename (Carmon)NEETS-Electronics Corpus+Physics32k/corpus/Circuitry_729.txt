Logic probes 
 
The  simplest,  and  by  far  the  most  convenient, 
method of tracing logic states involves the use of a 
logic  probe.  This  invaluable  tool  comprises  a 
compact  hand-held  probe  fitted  with  LEDs  that 
indicate the logical state of its probe tip. 
  Unlike  multi-range  meters,  logic  probes  can 
distinguish  between 
lines  which  are  actively 
pulsing  and  those  which  are  in  a  permanently  tri-
state condition. In the case of a line which is being 
pulsed, the logic 0 and logic 1 indicators will both 
be  illuminated  (though  not  necessarily  with  the 
same brightness) whereas, in the case of a tri-state 
line neither indicator should be illuminated. 
  Logic  probes  usually  also  provide  a  means  of 
displaying  pulses  having  a  very  short  duration 
which  may  otherwise  go  undetected.  This  is 
accomplished by the inclusion of a pulse stretching 
circuit  (i.e.  a  monostable).  This  elongates  short 
duration  pulses  so  that  a  visible  indication  is 
produced on a separate ‘pulse’ LED. 
  Logic  probes  invariably  derive  their  power 
supply from the circuit under test and are connected 
by means of a short length of twin flex fitted with 
insulated  crocodile  clips.  While  almost  any 
convenient  connecting  point  may  be  used,  the 
positive  supply  and  ground  terminals  make  ideal 
connecting points which can be easily identified. 
  A  typical  logic  probe  circuit  is  shown  in  
Fig.  15.16.  This  circuit  uses  a  dual  comparator  to 
sense the logic 0 and logic 1 levels and a timer that 
acts  as  a  monostable  pulse  stretcher  to  indicate 
the  presence  of  a  pulse  input  rather  than  a 
continuous  logic  0  or  logic  1  condition.  Typical 
logic  probe  indications  and  waveforms  are  shown 
in Fig. 15.18.
