Using your multimeter set to measure resistance 
in ohms, you can verify the equivalent resistance 
of resistors in series and resistors in parallel.
The  following  photos  show  how  to  measure 
the equivalent resistance of three resistors in 
series (left), two resistors in parallel (center), 
and a combination of one resistor in series with 
two parallel resistors (right). Select any three 
resistors and try this out for yourself!
The resistors in the photos have nominal values 
of 220 kΩ, 33 kΩ, and 1 kΩ. In both the center and 
right photos, the parallel resistors are the 220 kΩ 
and 33 kΩ resistors. The lone resistor in series in 
the photo on the right is the 1 kΩ resistor.
For the series resistors (left photo), the cal­
culated  equivalent  resistance  in  kΩ  was
