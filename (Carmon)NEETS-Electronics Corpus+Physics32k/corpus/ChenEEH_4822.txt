these methods. These methods form the interface that all
other objects can use to interact with these sensors (such as a
control algorithm reading the current data). A Java example
of a method call made from a control algorithm is y Â¼
gps.readData(), where gps is an object of the GPS class and
readData() is the method within the object that can be
accessed publicly by other objects.
