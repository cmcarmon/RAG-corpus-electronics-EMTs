It is obvious that these ‘‘defects’’ in the models could be corrected by making
the models more complicated. But the considerable increase in complexity
might not be justified by the improvement in model accuracy. Unfortunately,
it is not always obvious in a given problem how to find a reasonable balance
between simplicity and accuracy. In this text we will always strive for simplicity
on the following basis: Computer solutions for any of the problems we discuss
are always available, and these can be structured to have great accuracy. So
it makes sense in modeling with circuit elements, as opposed to computer
modeling, to strive for insight rather than accuracy, for simplicity rather than
complexity.
