Consider the two-stage MOSFET amplifier shown in Figure 13.19. When biased
properly, this circuit behaves as a linear amplifier for small signals. This example
was used in Section 13.1 (Figure 13.2) to motivate the study of methods based
on the sinusoidal steady state. There we made the experimental observation
that the presence of the capacitor CGS makes the gain of the amplifier fall off
rapidly at high frequencies. We now explain why.
