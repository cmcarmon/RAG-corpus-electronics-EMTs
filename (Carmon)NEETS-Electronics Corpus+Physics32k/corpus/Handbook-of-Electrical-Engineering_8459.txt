Number Representation
The  only  way  to  represent  information  in  a  digital  computer  is  via  a  string  of  bits,  i.e.,  zeros  and  ones.  The
number of bits being used depends on the length of the computer word, which is a quantity of bits on which
hardware is capable of operating (sometimes also a quantity that is brought to the CPU from memory in a
single access). The ﬁrst question is what relationship to use in establishing correspondence between those bits
and a number. Second, we need to make sure that certain properties that exist in the corresponding number
representation  system are  satisﬁed  and  that  they  directly  correspond  to  the  operations  being  performed  in
hardware over the taken string of bits.
