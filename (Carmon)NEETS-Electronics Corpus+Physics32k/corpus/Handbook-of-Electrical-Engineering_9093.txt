By default, 8-bit processor maximum memory space is 64 kilobytes (216), but in most manufactured ICCs
that space is not fully used. Why so, if even 64k seems to be today less than nothing? The answer is simple:
price. The device being sold yearly in hundreds of millions must be cheap, but memory forms a considerable
part of the overall cost of the chip. So, as much software as possible is needed in as little memory as a developer
can possibly accept.
