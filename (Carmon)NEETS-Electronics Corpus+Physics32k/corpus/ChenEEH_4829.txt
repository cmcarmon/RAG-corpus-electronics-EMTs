In a layered architecture, objects are designed using a building
block mentality. The bottom layer is composed of objects that
perform low-level, often tedious functions. The next layer has
somewhat higher functionality and makes calls to the objects
in the lower layer. Each successive layer upward is more high-
level in its functionality. A common way of explaining this
layering is that the details are ‘‘abstracted away,’’ meaning that
some of the tedious details needed to perform the function
are hidden from the higher level objects simply by delegating
them to the lower levels. In a layered architecture, the object
calls are all downward. This architecture is the motivation
for the libraries of common function calls that are available
including the application
