Euler's first law states that the linear momentum of a body, p (also denoted G) is equal to the product of the mass of the body m and the velocity of its center of mass vcm:





p

=
m


v



c
m





{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} _{\rm {cm}}}
.
Internal forces between the particles that make up a body do not contribute to changing the total momentum of the body as there is an equal and opposite force resulting in no net effect. The law is also stated as:





F

=
m


a



c
m





{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} _{\rm {cm}}}
.
where acm = dvcm/dt is the acceleration of the centre of mass and F = dp/dt is the total applied force on the body. This is just the time derivative of the previous equation (m is a constant).
