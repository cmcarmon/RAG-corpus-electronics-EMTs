Congratulations! You have just finished the last chapter in Introduction to Digital Computers. In this 
chapter you learned about many things that were mentioned in other chapters, without a detailed 
explanation. This was done intentionally, as some of the subjects would have been too difficult and hard 
to understand without background knowledge. Through your study of chapters 1, 2, and 3, you gained 
enough knowledge to understand chapter 4. This chapter should have answered a lot of questions for you 
and made certain subjects more clear.
