15.2.3 Figure P15.2.3 illustrates a way to generate an
AM wave of the form of Equation (15.2.2), using
a nonlinear device and an appropriate bandpass
Ô¨Ålter. Comment on the nature of the BPF to be
used.
15.2.4 If the nonlinear device in Problem 15.2.3 pro-
duces z = ay2, determine how the system must
be augmented to obtain an AM wave in the form
of Equation (15.2.2).
