Although  DFE  provides  a  systems-based,  life  cycle  approach,  its  true  value  to  the  system  designer  is  lost
unless the impact of DFE decisions on other relevant economic and performance measures (i.e., cost, electrical
performance,  reliability,  etc.)  can  be  quickly  and  accurately  assessed.  Trade-off  analysis  tools  that  have  DFE
embedded can perform process ï¬‚ow-based environmental analysis (energy/mass balance, waste stream analysis,
etc.) concurrently with non-environmental cost and performance analysis so that system designers can accu-
rately evaluate the impact of critical design decisions early.
