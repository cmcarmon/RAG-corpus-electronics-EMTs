Science fiction and fantasy avenues suggest a number of potential uses of force fields
A barrier allowing workers to function in areas exposed to the vacuum of space. The atmosphere inside would be habitable by humans, while at the same time allowing permissible objects to pass through the barrier
A walkable surface between two points without the necessity of building a bridge.
An emergency quarantine area to service those afflicted by harmful biological or chemical agents
A fire extinguisher where oxygen is exhausted by the use of a space confined by a force field thereby starving the fire
As a shield to protect against damage from natural forces or an enemy attack
A temporary habitable space in an area otherwise unsuitable for sustaining life
As a security apparatus used to confine or contain a captive
The capabilities and functionality of force fields vary; in some works of fiction (such as in the Star Trek universe), energy shields can nullify, or mitigate the effects of both energy and particle (e.g. phasers) and conventional weapons, as well as super natural forces. In many fictional scenarios, the shields function primarily as a defensive measure against weapons fired from other spacecraft. Force fields in these stories also generally prevent transporting. There are generally two kinds of force fields postulated; one in which energy is projected as a flat plane from emitters around the edges of a space craft; and another where energy surrounds a ship like a bubble.
