where q is the charge on each conductor, and v is the potential difference between the two
perfect conductors. With v being proportional to q, C is a constant determined by the geometric
conﬁguration of the two conductors. Figure 1.2.5(a) illustrates a two-conductor system carrying
+q and −q charges, respectively, forming a capacitor.
