The reactance type of inductance measuring equipment makes use of the following principle: If an ac
voltage of fixed frequency is applied across an inductor (and a resistor in series), the voltage drop
produced across the reactance of the inductor by the resulting current flow is directly proportional to the
value of the inductance. An inductance measurement using the reactance method is identical to
capacitance measurements using the same method, except that current flow is directly proportional to the
value of inductance, rather than inversely proportional as in the case of capacitance. It follows then that if
a reactance-type capacitance measuring equipment is provided with a chart that converts the capacitance
readings to equivalent inductance values and a proper range multiplying factor, the same test setup can be
used to measure both capacitance and inductance. In practice, test equipment using the reactance method
for capacitance measurements usually provides an inductance conversion chart. Because the current
flowing through the inductance under test is directly proportional to the value of inductance, the
reciprocals of the capacitance range multipliers must be used; for example, a multiplier of 0.1 becomes
