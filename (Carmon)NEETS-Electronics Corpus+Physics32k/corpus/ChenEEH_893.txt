Note that most of the clock skews (speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst four)
listed in Table 1 are at one end of the corresponding permis-
sible range. This positioning is due to the inherent feature of
linear programming that seeks the objective function ex-
tremum at a vertex of the solution space. In practice, however,
this situation can be dangerous since correct circuit operation
is strongly dependent on the accurate implementation of a
large number of clock delays—effectively, the clock skews—
across the circuit. It is quite possible that the actual values of
some of these clock delays may ﬂuctuate from the target
values—due to manufacturing tolerances as well as variations
in temperature and supply voltage—thereby causing a cata-
strophic timing failure of the circuit. Observe that while zero
clocking failures can be corrected by operating the circuit at a
slower speed (higher clock period TCP), double clocking viola-
tions are race conditions that are catastrophic and render the
circuit nonfunctional.
