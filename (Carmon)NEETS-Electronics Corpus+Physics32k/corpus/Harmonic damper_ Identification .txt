The damper will be fitted at the front of the engine (opposite the clutch or transmission) just beyond the cover of the timing chain, gears, or belt, and behind the accessory drive pulley (which may carry one or more V, serpentine or cogged belts. In older vehicles the pulley and damper were separate units that were bolted together. In late model vehicles the two have been combined into one unit. Timing marks are almost always engraved for purposes of setting the ignition timing.
