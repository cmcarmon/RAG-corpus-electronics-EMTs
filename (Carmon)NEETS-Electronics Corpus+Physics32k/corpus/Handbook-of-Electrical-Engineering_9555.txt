Expert systems is probably the most practical application of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI). Artiﬁcial intelligence,
as a ﬁeld, has two major thrusts: (1) to supplement human brain power with intelligent computer power and
(2) to better understand how we think, learn, and reason. Expert systems are one application of AI, and they
are being developed and used throughout the world [Feigenbaum et al., 1988; Liebowitz, 1990]. Other major
applications of AI are robotics, speech understanding, natural-language understanding, computer vision, and
neural networks.
