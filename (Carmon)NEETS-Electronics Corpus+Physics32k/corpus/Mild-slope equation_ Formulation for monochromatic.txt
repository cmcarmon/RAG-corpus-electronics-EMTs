{\displaystyle (x,y)}
is the horizontal position;




ω

is the angular frequency of the monochromatic wave motion;




i

is the imaginary unit;

{\displaystyle \Re \{\cdot \}}

{\displaystyle c_{g}}

The phase and group speed depend on the dispersion relation, and are derived from Airy wave theory as:
