A different concept than the nonlinear logarithmic transfor-
mation is followed by mapping of data to appropriately selec-
ted ﬁnite ﬁelds. This may be achieved through the use of one of
the many available versions of the residue number system
(RNS) (Szabo and Tanaka, 1967). RNS arithmetic faces difﬁ-
culties with sign detection, division, and magnitude compari-
son. These difﬁculties may outweigh the beneﬁts it presents
for addition, subtraction, and multiplication as far as general
computing is concerned. Its use in specialized computations,
like those for signal processing, offers many advantages. RNS
has been used to offer superior fault tolerance capabilities
as well as high-speed, small-area, and/or signiﬁcant power-
dissipation savings in the design of signal processing architec-
tures for FIR ﬁlters (Freking and Parhi, 1997) and other cir-
cuits (Chren, 1998). RNS may even reduce the computational
load in complex-number processing (Taylor et al., 1985), thus
