In convective form (i.e., the form with the convective operator made explicit in the momentum equation), the incompressible Euler equations in case of density constant in time and uniform in space are:

where:






u




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {u}}}
is the flow velocity vector, with components in an N-dimensional space

{\displaystyle u_{1},u_{2},\dots ,u_{N}}

D

t





{\displaystyle {D \over Dt}}
denotes the material derivative in time,




⋅


{\displaystyle \cdot }
denotes the scalar product,




∇


{\displaystyle \nabla }
is the nabla operator, here used to represent the specific thermodynamic work gradient (first equation), and




∇
⋅

u



{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} }
is the flow velocity divergence (second equation),




w


{\displaystyle w}
is the specific (with the sense of per unit mass) thermodynamic work, the internal source term.





g



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} }
represents body accelerations (per unit mass) acting on the continuum, for example gravity, inertial accelerations, electric field acceleration, and so on.
The first equation is the Euler momentum equation with uniform density (for this equation it could also not be constant in time). By expanding the material derivative, the equations become:

In fact for a flow with uniform density

{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
the following identity holds:

∇
p


{\displaystyle \nabla w\equiv \nabla \left({\frac {p}{\rho _{0}}}\right)={\frac {1}{\rho _{0}}}\nabla p}

where



p


{\displaystyle p}
is the mechanic pressure. The second equation is the incompressible constraint, stating the flow velocity is a solenoidal field (the order of the equations is not casual, but underlines the fact that the incompressible constraint is not a degenerate form of the continuity equation, but rather of the energy equation, as it will become clear in the following). Notably, the continuity equation would be required also in this incompressible case as an additional third equation in case of density varying in time or varying in space. For example, with density uniform but varying in time, the continuity equation to be added to the above set would correspond to:







∂
ρ


∂
t



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}=0}

So the case of constant and uniform density is the only one not requiring the continuity equation as additional equation regardless of the presence or absence of the incompressible constraint. In fact, the case of incompressible Euler equations with constant and uniform density being analyzed is a toy model featuring only two simplified equations, so it is ideal for didactical purposes even if with limited physical relevancy.
The equations above thus represent respectively conservation of mass (1 scalar equation) and momentum (1 vector equation containing



N


{\displaystyle N}
scalar components, where



N


{\displaystyle N}
is the physical dimension of the space of interest). In 3D for example

{\displaystyle N=3}

and
