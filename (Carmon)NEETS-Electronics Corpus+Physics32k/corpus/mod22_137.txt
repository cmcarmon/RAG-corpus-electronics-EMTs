Computer programs may be so complex that the number of instructions plus the parameters 
necessary for program execution will exceed the memory capacity of a stored-program computer. When 
this occurs, the program may be sectionalized; that is, broken down into modules. One or more modules 
are then stored in computer memory and the rest in an easily accessible auxiliary memory. Then as each 
module is executed producing the desired results, it is swapped out of internal memory and the next 
succeeding module read in.
