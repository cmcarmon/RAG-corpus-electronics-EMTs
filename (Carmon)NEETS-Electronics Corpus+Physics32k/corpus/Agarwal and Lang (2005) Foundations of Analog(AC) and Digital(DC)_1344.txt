e x e r c i s e 9.3 Consider a power line on a computer backplane that is 2.5 mm
wide, and separated from its underlying ground plane by 25 µm. Let the permittivity
and permeability of the separating insulator be 2◦ and µ◦, respectively. What is the
capacitance and inductance of the line per 10 cm of length?
