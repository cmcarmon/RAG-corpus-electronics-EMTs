The fundamental observation behind the simpliﬁcation pro-
cess is that quantities present in the realization for GG1
i reappear
in the realizations for GG1
j , j > i. The motivation behind the
simpliﬁcation process is that in computing the output of a
given controller component GG1
i , the most efﬁcient algorithm
is to compute these repeated quantities only once, store them
in memory, and then reuse them as needed. The reduction
process is thus a problem of identifying a set G of elements
i , i ¼ 1,
common to a sequence of controller components GG1
2, 3, . . . , n, and determining which ones to save for later reuse.
