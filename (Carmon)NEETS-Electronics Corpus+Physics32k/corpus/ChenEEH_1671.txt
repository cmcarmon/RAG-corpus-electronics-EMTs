Discrete cosine transform (DCT) is at the heart of the JPEG
still-image compression standard and many of the video com-
pression standards, like MPEG-1, MPEG-2, and H.261. Shen
and Sethi (1996) have used DCT coefﬁcients of encoded blocks
to mark areas of interest in the image. This distinction can be
used to give more preference to these areas when processing
the image for content representation. Locations of areas of
interest are those parts of the image that show sufﬁciently
large intensity changes. This is achieved by computing the
variance of pixels in a rectangular window around the current
pixel. In the DCT domain, this translates to computing the ac
energy according to the relationship:
