is not ordinarily seen in the ECG because it is obscured by the ventricular QRS wave. During the QRS wave the
ventricles contract, then relax following their recovery potential, the T wave; Fig. 113.12 summarizes this sequence.
Ordinarily the Tp wave is not visible. However, if the propagation of excitation from the atria to the ventricles
is  blocked,  the  Tp  wave  can  be  seen.  Figure 113.13  is  a  record  of  the  ECG  from  a  limb  lead  and  a  recording
from a lead within the right atrium in a subject with transient AV block. Note that the sharp P wave in the
atrial lead coincides with the P wave in the limb recording and that the atrial lead shows both P and Tp waves,
easily identiÔ¨Åed during AV block.
