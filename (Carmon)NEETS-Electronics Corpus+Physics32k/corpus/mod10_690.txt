When two collinear half-wave elements are connected directly so their currents are in the same 
phase, the effect is the same as that of a full-wave antenna, as shown in figure 4-22, view A. The current 
in the first 1/2 wavelength is exactly 180 degrees out of phase with that in the second 1/2 wavelength. 
This is the opposite of the desired condition. In the illustration, arrows are used to indicate the direction of 
current flow in the antenna. (Using arrows is a convenient means of determining the phase on more 
complicated arrays.)
