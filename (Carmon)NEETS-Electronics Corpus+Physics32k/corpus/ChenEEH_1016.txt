The capacitance load of a circuit is made of two compon-
ents: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic capacitance refers to
internal parasitic capacitances of the circuit, and they consist
of drain and source to substrate and overlap capacitances. The
extrinsic capacitances are the parasitic capacitances of the
fan-out, driven by the circuit (normally gate and overlap
capacitances) and the routing capacitances resulting from the
routing between the circuit and its fanout gates (Rabaey,
1996). Accordingly, capacitances can be kept at a minimum
by using less logic, smaller devices, and fewer and shorter
interconnects.
