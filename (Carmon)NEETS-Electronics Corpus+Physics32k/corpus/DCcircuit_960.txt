Notice how current is being pushed backwards through battery 2 (electrons ﬂowing “up”)
due to the higher voltage of battery 1 (whose current is pointed “down” as it normally would)!
Despite the fact that battery B2’s polarity is trying to push electrons down in that branch of the
circuit, electrons are being forced backwards through it due to the superior voltage of battery
B1. Does this mean that the stronger battery will always “win” and the weaker battery always
get current forced through it backwards? No! It actually depends on both the batteries’ relative
voltages and the resistor values in the circuit. The only sure way to determine what’s going on
is to take the time to mathematically analyze the network.
