If a column is loaded suddenly and then the load released, the column can sustain a much higher load than its static (slowly applied) buckling load. This can happen in a long, unsupported column used as a drop hammer. The duration of compression at the impact end is the time required for a stress wave to travel along the column to the other (free) end and back down as a relief wave. Maximum buckling occurs near the impact end at a wavelength much shorter than the length of the rod, and at a stress many times the buckling stress of a statically-loaded column. The critical condition for buckling amplitude to remain less than about 25 times the effective rod straightness imperfection at the buckle wavelength is

{\displaystyle \sigma }
is the impact stress,



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the length of the rod,



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the elastic wave speed, and

{\displaystyle h}
is the smaller lateral dimension of a rectangular rod. Because the buckle wavelength depends only on

and
