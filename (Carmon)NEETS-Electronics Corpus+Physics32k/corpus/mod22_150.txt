Semiconductor memory consists of hundreds of thousands of tiny electronic circuits etched on a 
silicon chip (fig. 2-4). Each of these electronic circuits is called a bit cell and can be in either an off or on 
state to represent a 0 or 1 bit, depending on whether or not current is flowing in that cell. Another name 
you will hear used for semiconductor memory chips is integrated circuits (ICs). Developments in 
technology have led to large scale integration (LSI), which means that more and more circuits can be 
squeezed onto the same silicon chip. Companies are even manufacturing very large scale integrated 
circuits (VLSI), which means even further miniaturization.
