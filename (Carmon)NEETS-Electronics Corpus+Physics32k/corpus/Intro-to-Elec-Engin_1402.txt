where the Gs are the power gains of the ampliﬁers, and the Ls are the transmission losses of the
two parts of the line. Equation (15.1.15) reveals that we can compensate for the line loss and get
Pout ≥ Pin if G1G2G3 ≥ L1L2. Noise considerations often call for a preampliﬁer to boost the signal
level before the noise becomes signiﬁcant. As in the case of transcontinental telephone links,
several repeaters are generally required for long-distance transmission.
