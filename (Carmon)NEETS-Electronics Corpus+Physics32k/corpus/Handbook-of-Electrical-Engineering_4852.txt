For  a  multivalley  semiconductor,  e.g.,  n-type  silicon,  the  energy  minima  (ellipsoids  of  revolutions)  of  the
unstrained  state  in  momentum  space  are  along  the  six  <100>  cubic  symmetry  directions;  they  possess  the
symmetry group Oh(m3m). A tensile stress in the x-direction, for example, will strain the lattice in the xy-plane
and  destroy  the  three-fold  symmetry,  thereby  lifting  the  degeneracy  of  the  energy  minima.  However,  the
four-fold symmetry along the x-direction will be preserved. Thus, the two valleys along the direction of stress
will be shifted relative to the four valleys in the perpendicular directions.
