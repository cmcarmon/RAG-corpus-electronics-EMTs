Jupiter mass, also called Jovian mass is the unit of mass equal to the total mass of the planet Jupiter. This value may refer to the mass of planet Jupiter alone, or the mass of the entire Jovian system to include the Moons of Jupiter. Jupiter is by far the most massive planet in the solar system. It is approximately 2.5 times more massive than all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.
Jupiter mass is a common unit of mass in astronomy that is used to indicate the masses of other similarly-sized objects, including the outer planets and extrasolar planets. It may also be used to describe the masses of brown dwarfs, as this unit provides a convenient scale for comparison.
