The JMA announced the hit rate of the Earthquake Early Warning for the 2011 fiscal year on 31 May 2012. The hit rate is defined as the percentage occurrence of the warning issued immediately upon P-waves detected having a Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale (震度, shindo) number (range 0 to 7) that falls within plus-minus 1 Magnitude-Shindo Number of ten Magnitude-Shindo Numbers measured for that earthquake.
Fiscal year 2007: 75%
Fiscal year 2008: 82%
Fiscal year 2009: 76%
Fiscal year 2010: 28%
Fiscal year 2011: 56%
For the fiscal years 2007 to 2009 the hit rate was over 75%. In fiscal year 2010, the hit rate came down to 28% due to the number of aftershocks following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which occurred near the end of fiscal year 2010. The hit rate for that year had been 72% until the Tohoku earthquake. Measurement techniques have subsequently been refined to ignore small scale earthquakes; the hit rate for fiscal year 2011 increased to 56%. The JMA aimed to increase the hit rate to over 85% in fiscal year 2015.
