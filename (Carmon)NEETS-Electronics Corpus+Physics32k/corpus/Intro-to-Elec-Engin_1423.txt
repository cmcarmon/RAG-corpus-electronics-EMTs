Figure 15.1.11(a) shows a typical receiving system with noise. The antenna is a source of noise
with effective noise temperature Ta, known as the antenna temperature. Whatever receiving path
components (such as transmission lines, waveguides, and ﬁlters) are present prior to the receiver’s
ampliﬁer, their noise effect is represented by a noisy loss Lr (≥ 1) between points A and B, while
the loss is assumed to have a physical temperature TL. The noisy receiver is supposed to operate at
a nominal center frequency f 0, and have available power gain Ga(f ) as a function of the frequency,
with Ga(f 0) as center-frequency power gain. Nao represents the total available output noise power
in Figure 15.1.11(a).
