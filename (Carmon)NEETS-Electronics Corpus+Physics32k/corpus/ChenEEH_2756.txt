We again consider the possibility of ~vvp exceeding c. From
our previous discussion of equations 9.53a and 9.53b,
the minimum free space wavelength that can be sampled
without aliasing is l0; min ¼ c=fmax ¼ 2cDt , and the corres-
ponding minimum spatial-sampling density is Nl; min ¼
l0; min=D ¼ 2S. Then from equation 9.62,
ﬃﬃﬃ
the maximum
numerical phase velocity is given by:
