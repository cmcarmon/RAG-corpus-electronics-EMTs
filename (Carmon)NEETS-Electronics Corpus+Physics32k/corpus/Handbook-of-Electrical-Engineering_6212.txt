Skywave  propagation  necessarily  involves  some  fading  and  less  predictable  ﬁeld  intensities  and  is  most
appropriately described in terms of statistics or the percentage of time a particular ﬁeld strength level is found.
Figure 69.10 shows skywave propagation for a 100-mV/m ﬁeld strength at a distance of 1 km for midpoint path
latitudes of 35 to 50 degrees.
