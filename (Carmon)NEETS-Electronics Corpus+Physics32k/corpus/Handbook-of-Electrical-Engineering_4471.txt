Statics Limit
In the statics limit (dc) the time-dependent terms in Eq. (44.1) vanish, and the ﬁeld can be described entirely
by  the  Poisson  equation  in  terms  of  a  single  component  scalar  potential,  which  will  be  economic  from  the
numerical point of view. In this case the deﬁning equation is
