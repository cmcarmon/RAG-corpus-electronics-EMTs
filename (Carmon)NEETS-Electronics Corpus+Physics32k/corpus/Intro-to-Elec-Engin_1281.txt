The heart of any communication system consists of three basic elements: transmitter, trans-
mission medium or channel, and receiver. The transmitter (input processor) converts the electric
signal into a form that is suitable for transmission through the physical channel or transmis-
sion medium. For example, in radio and TV broadcasts, since the FCC (Federal Communi-
cations Commission) speciÔ¨Åes the frequency range for each transmitting station, the trans-
mitter must translate the information signal to be transmitted into the appropriate frequency
range that matches the frequency allocation assigned to the transmitter. This process is called
modulation, which usually involves the use of the information signal to vary systematically
the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a sinusoidal carrier. Thus, in general, carrier modula-
tion such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation
