Indeed, Figure 1.27b is one example of a model. We have modeled a
physical device, namely, a length of copper wire, by a pair of ideal two-terminal
elements: a perfect conductor and a linear resistance. Obviously this model
is not exact. For example,
if 1000 A of current flowed through a piece of
14-gauge copper wire (standard house wire designed to carry 15 A), the wire
would become hot, glow brightly, and probably melt, thereby converting itself
from a resistor with a very small resistance, for example, 0.001 , to an infinite
resistor. Our model, consisting of an ideal conductor in series with an ideal
0.001- resistor, shows no such behavior: With 1000 A flowing, a one-volt
drop would develop across the resistor, and one thousand watts of power
would be dissipated, presumably in heat, as long as the current flowed. No
smoke, no burnout.
