tors. The parasitic parameters play very important roles. The
capacitor should be considered as an ideal capacitor in series
with an ESR and an ESL, as shown in Figure 1.6 (Wong, 1997).
There are interconnection parasitic inductances and resist-
ances between bulk capacitors and decoupling capacitors and
between decoupling capacitors and packaging capacitors.
Future microprocessor load transitions will have a 5-A/ns
slew rate. In this case, all these parasitics have a signiÔ¨Åcant
