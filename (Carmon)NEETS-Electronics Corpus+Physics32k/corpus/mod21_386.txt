When using a stroboscope to measure the speed of rotating or reciprocating mechanisms, hold the 
instrument so that the light from the stroboscope lamp falls directly on the part to be observed. If the part 
is uniform, or symmetrical, place an identification mark with chalk or a grease pencil on the portion to be 
observed. This method provides a positive means of identification, because if only one reference mark is 
observed during measurement, you can be sure that either the fundamental synchronization or a 
submultiple thereof has been obtained. If the approximate speed of rotation is known, the stroboscope 
controls may be set to the appropriate positions prior to actual measurement. The main frequency control 
that determines the rate of the flashing light is then varied until the reference mark on the moving part 
appears to be standing still. The calibrated scale of the stroboscope will then show the speed directly in 
revolutions per minute (rpm).
