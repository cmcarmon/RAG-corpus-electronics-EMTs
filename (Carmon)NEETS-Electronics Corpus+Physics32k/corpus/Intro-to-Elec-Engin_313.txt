in Figure P3.2.17 as a sum of step functions.
3.2.18 The voltage waveform of Figure P3.2.18 is applied
to an RLC series circuit with R = 2 , L = 2 H,
and C = 1 F. Obtain i(t) in the series circuit. (Note
that the capacitor and inductor values are chosen
here for calculational ease, although they are too
big and not typical.)
3.2.19 (a) Let a unit impulse of current i(t ) = Î´(t ) be
applied to a parallel combination of R = 3 
and C = 1
2 F. Determine the voltage vC(t)
across the capacitor.
