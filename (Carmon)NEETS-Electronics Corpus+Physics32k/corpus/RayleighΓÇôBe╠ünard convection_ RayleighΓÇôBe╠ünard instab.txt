Since there is a density gradient between the top and the bottom plate, gravity acts trying to pull the cooler, denser liquid from the top to the bottom. This gravitational force is opposed by the viscous damping force in the fluid. The balance of these two forces is expressed by a non-dimensional parameter called the Rayleigh number. The Rayleigh number is defined as:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} _{L}={\frac {g\beta }{\nu \alpha }}(T_{b}-T_{u})L^{3}}

where
Tu is the temperature of the top plate
Tb is the temperature of the bottom plate
L is the height of the container
g is the acceleration due to gravity
ν is the kinematic viscosity
α is the Thermal diffusivity
β is the Thermal expansion coefficient.
As the Rayleigh number increases, the gravitational forces become more dominant. At a critical Rayleigh number of 1708, instability sets in and convection cells appear.
The critical Rayleigh number can be obtained analytically for a number of different boundary conditions by doing a perturbation analysis on the linearized equations in the stable state. The simplest case is that of two free boundaries, which Lord Rayleigh solved in 1916, obtaining Ra = ​27⁄4 π4 ≈ 657.51. In the case of a rigid boundary at the bottom and a free boundary at the top (as in the case of a kettle without a lid), the critical Rayleigh number comes out as Ra = 1,100.65.
