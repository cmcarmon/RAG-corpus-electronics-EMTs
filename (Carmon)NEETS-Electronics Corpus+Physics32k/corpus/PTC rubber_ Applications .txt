The PTC rubber can be rolled into thin sheets and laminated with copper. The copper is in turn connected to a voltage to provide the electrical field inside the material necessary to trigger the tunneling effect. The sheets can be formed into any shape and size.
PTC rubber sheets can be used as thin flexible PTC heaters. These heaters will provide high power when they are cold and rapidly heat up themselves to a constant temperature and remain there virtually unaffected by changes in the ambient conditions. They can be powered with any voltage between 5 and 400 V, AC or DC.
The PTC rubber material is a self-regulating heater. It produces the same amount of heat in each point of the heater as is conducted and radiated away from the heater to the object it is attached to, and its surroundings. It is in constant thermal equilibrium with the environment, point by point. A measure of the power produced by the heater is actually a measurement of the heat transfer between the heater and the object. Hence, it can be used as a heat transfer sensor.
