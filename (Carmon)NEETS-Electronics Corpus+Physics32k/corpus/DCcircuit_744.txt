We still have a question of range for our ohmmeter, though. What value of resistance
between the test leads will cause exactly 1/2 scale deﬂection of the needle? If we know that the
movement has a full-scale rating of 1 mA, then 0.5 mA (500 µA) must be the value needed for
half-scale deﬂection. Following our design with the 9 volt battery as a source we get:
