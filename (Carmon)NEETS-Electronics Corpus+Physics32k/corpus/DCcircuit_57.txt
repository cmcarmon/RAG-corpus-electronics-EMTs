It is interesting to note that no ”wear” occurs within wires due to this electric current, unlike
water-carrying pipes which are eventually corroded and worn by prolonged ﬂows. Electrons do
encounter some degree of friction as they move, however, and this friction can generate heat in
a conductor. This is a topic we’ll explore in much greater detail later.
