Ionization occurs when high energy ultraviolet light waves from the sun enter the ionospheric region 
of the atmosphere, strike a gas atom, and literally knock an electron free from its parent atom. A normal 
atom is electrically neutral since it contains both a positive proton in its nucleus and a negative orbiting 
electron. When the negative electron is knocked free from the atom, the atom becomes positively charged 
(called a positive ion) and remains in space along with the free electron, which is negatively charged. This 
process of upsetting electrical neutrality is known as IONIZATION.
