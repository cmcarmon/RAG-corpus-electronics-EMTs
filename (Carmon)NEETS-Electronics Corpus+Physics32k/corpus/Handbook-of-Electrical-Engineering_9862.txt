2. Figure 100.20 illustrates this rather general approximation
to  a  compensated  system  Bode  diagram  in  the  vicinity  of  the  crossover  frequency.  We  will  conclude  this
subsection by determining some general design requirements for a system with this transfer function and the
associated Bode asymptotic gain magnitude diagram of Fig. 100.20.
