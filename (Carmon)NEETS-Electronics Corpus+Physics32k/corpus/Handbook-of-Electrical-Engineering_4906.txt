where 
is typically
on  the  order  of  1  meV,  and  we  see  that  these  materials  must  be  kept  below  temperatures  of  about  10  K  to
exhibit their unique behavior. High critical temperature superconductors, in contrast, will superconduct up to
temperatures  of  about  100  K,  which  is  attractive  from  a  practical  view  because  the  materials  can  be  cooled
cheaply using liquid nitrogen. Other types of depairing energy are kinetic, resulting in a critical current density
J
. To summarize, a superconductor must be maintained under
c
the  appropriate  temperature,  electrical  current  density,  and  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld  conditions  to  exhibit  its  special
 
properties. An example of this phase space is shown in Fig.
