In properly designed ﬁn structure, h  can be expected to fall in the range of 0.5 to 0.8 [Kraus and Bar-Cohen,
1983]. Relatively thick ﬁns in a low velocity ﬂow of gas are likely to yield ﬁn efﬁciencies approaching unity.
This same unity value would be appropriate, as well, for an unﬁnned surface and, thus, serve to generalize the
use of Eq. (33.18) to all package conﬁgurations.
