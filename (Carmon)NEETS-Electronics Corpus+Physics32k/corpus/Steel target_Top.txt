Steel targets are shooting targets for firearms made out of hardened (martensitic) steel, and are used in sports such as cowboy action shooting, practical/dynamic shooting and for long range shooting, as well as recreational plinking. They are popular in both training and competitions because the shooter gets instant feedback on a hit in the form of sound, and one can also often see the bullet getting pulverized and the target moving. Hanging or self-resetting targets also have the advantage that the shooter need not go forward to tape the targets, making it a good option for shooting ranges that otherwise have electronic targets. Steel targets also are weather proof, contrary to paper targets that do not hold up when wet.
