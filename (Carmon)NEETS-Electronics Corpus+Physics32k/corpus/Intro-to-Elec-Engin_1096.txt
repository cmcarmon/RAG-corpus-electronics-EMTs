Let us consider the rotor speed given by Equation (13.1.5) and the same phase sequence of
sources. A rotating magnetic ﬁeld of constant amplitude, rotating at ωs rad/s relative to the
stator, is produced because of polyphase stator excitation. A rotating magnetic ﬁeld of constant
amplitude, rotating at ωs rad/s relative to the rotor, is also produced because of polyphase rotor
excitation. The speed of rotation of the rotor magnetic ﬁeld relative to the stator is ωm + ωr, or
ωs, if the rotor is rotating with a positive speed of rotation ωm in the direction of the rotating
ﬁelds. If so, the condition for energy conversion at constant torque is satisﬁed. Such a situation
is illustrated diagrammatically in Figure 13.1.5. Under these conditions the machine is operating
as a double-fed polyphase machine. Normally, in an induction machine with polyphase stator
and rotor windings, only a source to excite the stator is employed, and the rotor excitation at
the appropriate frequency is induced from the stator winding. The device is thus known as an
induction machine.
