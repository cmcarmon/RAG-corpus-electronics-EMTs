Conjugate Complex Poles
It is possible that some of the poles of Equation (3.3.10) are complex. Since the coefÔ¨Åcients ak
in Equation (3.3.9) are real, complex poles occur in complex conjugate pairs and will always be
even in number. Let us consider a pair of complex poles for which case Equation (3.3.10) may be
written as
