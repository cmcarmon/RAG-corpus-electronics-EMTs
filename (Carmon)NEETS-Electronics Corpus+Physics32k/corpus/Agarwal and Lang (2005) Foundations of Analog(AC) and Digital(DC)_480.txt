By the same argument, the effect of V2 and I on e1 can be calculated
using the subcircuits shown in Figure 3.34b and 3.34c, respectively. For V2,
sources V1 and I are set to zero, as shown in Figure 3.34b. Clearly circuits 3.34a
and 3.34b are identical in topology, so the effect of V2 on e1 can be written from
Equation 3.103 by interchanging R1 and R2, or G1 and G2 in Equation 3.104.
This will give us e1B, the component of e1 due to voltage source V2.
