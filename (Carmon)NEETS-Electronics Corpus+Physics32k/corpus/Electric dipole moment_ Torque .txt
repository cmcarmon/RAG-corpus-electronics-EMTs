An object with an electric dipole moment is subject to a torque τ when placed in an external electric field. The torque tends to align the dipole with the field. A dipole aligned parallel to an electric field has lower potential energy than a dipole making some angle with it. For a spatially uniform electric field E, the torque is given by:





τ

=


p


×


E



,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\mathbf {p} }\times {\mathbf {E} }\ ,}

where p is the dipole moment, and the symbol "×" refers to the vector cross product. The field vector and the dipole vector define a plane, and the torque is directed normal to that plane with the direction given by the right-hand rule.
A dipole oriented co- or anti-parallel to the direction in which a non-uniform electric field is increasing (gradient of the field) will experience a torque, as well as a force in the direction of its dipole moment. It can be shown that this force will always be parallel to the dipole moment regardless of co- or anti-parallel orientation of the dipole.
