The strength of polymer chains can be enhanced by cross-linking, which increases the interactions between chains through bonding with another reactant. The high mechanical strength of soil/polymer mixtures after cross-linking can make many polymers more suited for soil stabilization projects. Curing time after polymer addition can also affect the strength of the polymer-soil structures formed. After seven days of curing, the liquid polymer SS299 resulted in soil with two times the compressive strength of untreated soil. Some polymers can also acquire strength much more rapidly during curing than traditional, non-polymeric chemical additives.
