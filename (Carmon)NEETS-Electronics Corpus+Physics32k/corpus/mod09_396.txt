At T1, a negative trigger is applied to both bases through C1 and C2. The trigger does not affect Q1 
since it is already conducting. The trigger overcomes cutoff bias on Q2 and causes it to conduct. As Q2 
goes into conduction, its collector voltage becomes positive. The positive-going change at the Q2 
collector causes a reverse bias on the base of Q1. As the conduction of Q1 decreases to the cutoff point, 
the collector voltage becomes negative. This switching action causes a very rapid change of state with Q2 
now conducting and Q1 cut off.
