If n pulses (all having the same signal-to-noise ratio and
phase) were coherently integrated, the resultant signal-to-noise
ratio would be n times that of a single pulse. If the same pulses
are incoherently integrated, the resultant signal-to-noise ratio
would be less than n times that of a single pulse.
