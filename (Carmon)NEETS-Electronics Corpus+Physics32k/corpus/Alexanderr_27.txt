Unless  otherwise  stated,  we  will  follow  the  passive  sign  conven-
tion throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits of
Fig. 1.9 has an absorbing power of 
W because a positive current
enters  the  positive  terminal  in  both  cases.  In  Fig.  1.10,  however,  the
W because a positive current enters
element is supplying power of 
the  negative  terminal.  Of  course,  an  absorbing  power  of 
W is
equivalent to a supplying power of
