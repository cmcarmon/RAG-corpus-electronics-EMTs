For each topology, one should consider the characteristics,
reliability, expandability, and performance. The characteris-
tics of a topology should consider the connectivity of devices,
the components required (e.g., tap or splitter, etc.), and the
transmission. The reliability addresses how a node failure or
cable break would affect the operation of the network. The
expandability addresses the ease of adding a new station to the
network, and the performance should consider the delay char-
acteristics of the topology. The topologies used in the local
networks are star, ring, and bus/tree. Table 6.1 summaries these
topologies.
