Numerical solutions for the Ô¨Åeld equations are now routine for a large number of problems encountered in
magnet design; these include, for example, two-dimensional models taking into account nonlinear, anisotropic,
and even hysteretic effects. Their use for complete three-dimensional models is not so widespread because of
the escalating computer resources needed as the problem size increases. Nevertheless, 3-D solutions for non-
linear  statics  devices  are  regularly  obtained  in  industry,  and  time-dependent  solutions  are  rapidly  becoming
more cost effective as computer hardware architectures develop.
