Open-Architectures of Block-Diagram Editors
Flexible block-diagrams have the capability of allowing users to develop or modify the graphical representation
of  symbols  to  meet  the  needs  of  various  applications.  In  addition,  it  must  be  possible  to  add  or  modify  the
semantical meaning of the new or changed graphical symbols for simulation- or code-generation purposes.
