As with the capacitor, associated with the ability to exhibit memory is the
property of energy storage, which is often exploited by circuits that process
energy. To determine the magnetic energy wM stored in an inductor, we rec-
ognize that the power iv is the rate at which energy is delivered to the inductor
through its port. Thus,
