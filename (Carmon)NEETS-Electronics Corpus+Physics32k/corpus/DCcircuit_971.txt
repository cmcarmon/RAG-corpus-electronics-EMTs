This change of current direction from what was Ô¨Årst assumed will alter the polarity of the
voltage drops across R2 and R3 due to current I2. From here, we can say that the current
through R1 is 5 amps, with the voltage drop across R1 being the product of current and resis-
tance (E=IR), 20 volts (positive on the left and negative on the right). Also, we can safely say
that the current through R3 is 1 amp, with a voltage drop of 1 volt (E=IR), positive on the left
and negative on the right. But what is happening at R2?
