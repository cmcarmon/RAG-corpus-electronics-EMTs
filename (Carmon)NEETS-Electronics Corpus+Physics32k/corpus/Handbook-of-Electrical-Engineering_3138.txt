Power conversion deals with the process of converting electric power from one form to another. The power
 Because they contain no
electronic apparatuses performing the power conversion are called 
  power  converters.  The  power  conversion  is  achieved  using
moving  parts,  they  are  often  referred  to  as 
power semiconductor devices, which are used as switches. The power devices used are SCRs (silicon controlled
rectiﬁers, or thyristors), triacs, power transistors, power MOSFETs, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs),
and MCTs (MOS-controlled thyristors). The power converters are generally classiﬁed as:
