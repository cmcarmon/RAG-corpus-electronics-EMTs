Notice something very important here: at resistor R4, the polarities for the respective mesh
currents do not agree. This is because those mesh currents (I2 and I3) are going through R4 in
different directions. This does not preclude the use of the Mesh Current method of analysis,
but it does complicate it a bit. Though later, we will show how to avoid the R4 current clash.
