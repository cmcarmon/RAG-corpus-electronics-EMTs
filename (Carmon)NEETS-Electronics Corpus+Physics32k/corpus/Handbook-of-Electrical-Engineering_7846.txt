Magneto-Optical Readout
The  information  recorded  on  a  perpendicularly  magnetized  medium  may  be  read  with  the  aid  of  the  polar
magneto-optical Kerr effect. When linearly polarized light is normally incident on a perpendicular magnetic
medium,  its  plane  of  polarization  undergoes  a  slight  rotation  upon  reﬂection.  This  rotation  of  the  plane  of
polarization,  whose  sense  depends  on  the  direction  of  magnetization  in  the  medium,  is  known  as  the  polar
Kerr effect. The schematic representation of this phenomenon in Fig. 80.32 shows that if the polarization vector
suffers a counterclockwise rotation upon reﬂection from an up-magnetized region, then the same vector will
rotate clockwise when the magnetization is down. A magneto-optical medium is characterized in terms of its
reﬂectivity R and its Kerr rotation angle qk . R is a real number (between 0 and 1) that indicates the fraction
of the incident power reﬂected back from the medium at normal incidence. qk is generally quoted as a positive
number,  but  is  understood  to  be  positive  or  negative  depending  on  the  direction  of  magnetization;  in  MO
readout, it is the sign of qk that carries the information about the state of magnetization, i.e., the recorded bit
pattern.
