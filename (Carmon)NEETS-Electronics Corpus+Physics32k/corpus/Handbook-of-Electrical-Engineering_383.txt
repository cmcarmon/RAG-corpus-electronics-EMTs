The last two of the conditions that make the circuit less than ideal (line and source impedances) introduce
algebraic complications, but nothing fundamental is changed in the preceding theory. If these two conditions
are taken into account, the appropriate circuit takes the form shown in Fig. 3.31. Here the internal impedance
of a source and the line impedance connecting that source to its load are both connected in series with the
corresponding load. Thus, instead of the impedance in each phase being Z, it is Z + Zw + Zl, where w and l are
subscripts standing for “winding” and “line,” respectively. Hence, the rms value of each current is
