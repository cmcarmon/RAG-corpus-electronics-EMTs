The length and width of the slot, as well as material charac-
teristics, determine the operating characteristics of the an-
tenna. The planar slot antenna is typically operated at the
ﬁrst or second resonance. To estimate the proper length of
the antenna, it is necessary to know the effective permittivity of
the slot. For very thick dielectric substrates, the average of the
dielectric permittivity and air is used (i.e., eeff ¼ (er þ 1)=2).
This may be inaccurate for thin substrates, however. In this
case, it may be more suitable to use the effective permittivity of
a slot line transmission line with proper width. The width of
the antenna is often chosen as 10% of the length, allowing
fairly large input return loss bandwidths.
