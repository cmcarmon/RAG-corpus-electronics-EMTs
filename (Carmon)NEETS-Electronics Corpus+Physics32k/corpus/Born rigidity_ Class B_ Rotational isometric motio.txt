Herglotz defined this class in terms of equidistant curves which are the trajectories of a one-parameter motion group (this was called "group motion" by Salzmann & Taub and was identified with isometric Killing motion by Felix Pirani & Gareth Williams (1962)). He pointed out that they consist of worldlines whose three curvatures are constant (known as curvature, torsion and hypertorsion), forming a helix. Worldlines of constant curvatures in flat spacetime were also studied by Kottler (1912), Petrův (1964), John Lighton Synge (1967, who called them timelike helices in flat spacetime), or Letaw (1981, who called them stationary worldlines) as the solutions of the Frenet-Serret formulas.
Herglotz further separated class B using four one-parameter groups of Lorentz transformations (loxodromic, elliptic, hyperbolic, parabolic) in analogy to hyperbolic motions (i.e. isometric automorphisms of a hyperbolic space), and pointed out that Born's hyperbolic motion (which follows from the hyperbolic group with



α
=
0


{\displaystyle \alpha =0}
in the notation of Herglotz and Kottler,



λ
=
0


{\displaystyle \lambda =0}
in the notation of Lemaître,



q

0


{\displaystyle q=0}
in the notation of Synge; see the following table) is the only Born rigid motion that belongs to both classes A and B.
