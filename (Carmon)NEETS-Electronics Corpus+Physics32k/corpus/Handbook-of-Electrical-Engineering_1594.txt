From Eq. (16.13), the unknowns could be anywhere inside a sequence of circles with center zk and radius
Rk, and as a result, there are an inﬁnite number of solutions to this problem. Schur and Nevanlinna have given
an analytic characterization to these solutions in terms of bounded function extensions. A bounded function
r(z) is analytic in *z * < 1 and satisfies the inequality *r(z)* £ 1 everywhere in *z* < 1.
