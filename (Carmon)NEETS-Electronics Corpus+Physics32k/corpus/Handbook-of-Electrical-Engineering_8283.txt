. When the short signature is formed, a
loss of information occurs, and it can be the case that a faulty circuit produces the same signature of a fault-
free  circuit,  thus  remaining  undetected.  The  design  method  for  data  compaction  aims  at  minimizing  the
probability of aliasing. Using the compactors explained below, the probability of aliasing has been theoretically
k
 is the length of the compactor (and thus the length of the signature). It is important
proven to be 2
to note that (1) the result is asymptotically independent of the size and complexity of the circuit under test;
 and thus quite acceptable; and (3) the empirical
(2) for 
results show that in practice this method is even more effective. Most of all, this is the chosen methodology
when BIST is required for its effectiveness, speed, and small area overhead.
