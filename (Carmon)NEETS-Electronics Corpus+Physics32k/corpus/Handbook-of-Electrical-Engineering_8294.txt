Up  to  two  inputs  can  be  trivially  connected  to  an  LCAR,  or  it  can  be  easily  converted  to  accept  multiple
inputs  fed  through  the  cell  rules.  There  are  some  advantages  of  using  LCARs  instead  of  LFSRs:  ﬁrst,  the
localization  of  all  connections,  and  second,  and  most  importantly,  it  has  been  shown  that  LCARs  are  much
“better” pseudo-random pattern generators when used in autonomous mode, as they do not show the corre-
lation of bits due to the shifting of the LFSRs. Finally, the better pattern distribution provided by LCARs as
input stimuli has been shown to provide better detection for delay faults and open faults, normally very difﬁcult
to test.
