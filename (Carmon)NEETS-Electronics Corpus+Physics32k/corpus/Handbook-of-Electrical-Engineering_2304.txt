where Wn   <<  Lpn  is  assumed. tF  is  minimized  by  making Wn   very  small. Very  low-lifetime tF  is  required  for
high-speed  diodes.  Carrier lifetime tF  is  reduced  by  adding  a  large  concentration  of  recombination  centers
into the junction. This is common practice in the fabrication of high-speed computer diodes [Phillips, 1962].
The charge Qd is stored mainly in the n region in the form of a concentration gradient of holes in Fig. 22.21(a).
The diode is turned off by moving the switch from position (a) into position (b) [Fig. 22.21(a)]. The removal
of carriers is done in three time intervals. During the time interval t1, also called the recovery phase, a constant
* = VR/R ﬂows in the diode. During the time interval t2 – t1 the charge in the diode is reduced
reverse current *IR
by about 1/2 of the original charge. During the third interval t3 – t2, the residual charge is removed.
