Note that the damping factor for the quadratic term in the denominator is z = 0.35. If drawing the response
curves  by  hand,  the  resonance  peak  near  the  breakpoint  at  w  =  100  would  be  estimated  from  Fig.  11.5.
Figure 11.7 shows the exact gain and phase frequency response curves for G(s).
