You can determine several facts about fm signals by studying the frequency spectrum. For example,
table 2-1 was developed from the information in figure 2-9. Notice in the top spectrums of both views (A)
and (B) that the modulation index is 0.5. Also notice as you look at the next lower spectrums that the
modulation index is 1.0. Next down is 5.0, and finally, the bottom spectrums have modulation indexes of
