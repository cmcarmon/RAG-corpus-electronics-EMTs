A leg mechanism (walking mechanism) is an assembly of links and joints (a linkage) intended to simulate the walking motion of humans or animals. Mechanical legs can have one or more actuators, and can perform simple planar or complex motion.
Compared to a wheel, a leg mechanism is potentially better fitted to uneven terrain, as it can step over obstacles.
