A simple single degree of freedom system (a mass, M, on a spring of stiffness k, for example) has the following equation of motion:




M



x
¨



+
k
x
=
F
(
t
)


{\displaystyle M{\ddot {x}}+kx=F(t)}

where






x
¨





{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}}
is the acceleration (the double derivative of the displacement) and x is the displacement.
If the loading F(t) is a Heaviside step function (the sudden application of a constant load), the solution to the equation of motion is:




x
=



F

0


k


[
1
−
c
o
s

(
ω
t
)

]


{\displaystyle x={\frac {F_{0}}{k}}[1-cos{(\omega t)}]}

where



ω
=



k
M





{\displaystyle \omega ={\sqrt {\frac {k}{M}}}}
and the fundamental natural frequency,



f
=


ω

2
π





{\displaystyle f={\frac {\omega }{2\pi }}}
.
The static deflection of a single degree of freedom system is:





x

s
t
a
t
i
c


=



F

0


k




{\displaystyle x_{static}={\frac {F_{0}}{k}}}

so you can write, by combining the above formulae:




x
=

x

s
t
a
t
i
c


[
1
−
c
o
s
(
ω
t
)
]


{\displaystyle x=x_{static}[1-cos(\omega t)]}

This gives the (theoretical) time history of the structure due to a load F(t), where the false assumption is made that there is no damping.
Although this is too simplistic to apply to a real structure, the Heaviside Step Function is a reasonable model for the application of many real loads, such as the sudden addition of a piece of furniture, or the removal of a prop to a newly cast concrete floor. However, in reality loads are never applied instantaneously - they build up over a period of time (this may be very short indeed). This time is called the rise time.
As the number of degrees of freedom of a structure increases it very quickly becomes too difficult to calculate the time history manually - real structures are analysed using non-linear finite element analysis software.
