Connecting a zener diode in series with a P–N 
junction diode, with the P–N junction diode forward 
biased and the zener diode reverse biased, forms a 
temperature-compensated zener diode. By careful 
selection of the diodes, temperature coefficients can 
be selected that are equal and opposite. More than 
one P–N junction diode may be needed for proper 
compensation.
