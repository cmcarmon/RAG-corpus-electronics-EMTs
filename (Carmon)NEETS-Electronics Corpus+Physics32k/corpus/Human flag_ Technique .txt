The bottom arm is usually turned to grip the pole and is straight to "push" the body up. The top arm faces forward and grips on the pole. This arm "pulls" the body to maintain a parallel position to the ground. Easier variations include hooking one arm over the pole or by having the legs straddled, tucked or raised.
Learning the hold is generally done by starting with the legs parallel to the pole and then slowly lowering them to the ground. Tucking or straddling the legs alleviates pressure on the abdomen, also making the move much easier to hold.
