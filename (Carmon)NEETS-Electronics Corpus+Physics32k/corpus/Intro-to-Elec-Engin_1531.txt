Digital Transmission on Fading Multipath Channels
We have discussed thus far digital modulation and demodulation methods for the transmission
of information over two types of channels, namely, an additive noise channel and a linear Ô¨Ålter
channel. While these channel models are appropriate for a large variety of physical channels, they
become inadequate in characterizing signal transmission over radio channels whose transmission
characteristics vary with time. Time-varying behavior of the channel is exhibited by the following:
