Energy-Saving Lighting Techniques
Fluorescent  Systems  Considerations.  Fluorescent  lamps  are  sensitive  to  ambient  temperatures.  By  using
reduced wattage lamps or low-loss ballasts, less heat will be generated and the operating temperature point of
the lamp will probably change. The critical area is the coldest spot on the bulb surface. Most ﬂuorescent lamps
will peak in light output at around a 100(cid:176)F cold-spot temperature. For enclosed luminaire types that ordinarily
operate the lamp at higher temperature, replacing standard lamps with high-efﬁcacy, reduced wattage lamps
may result in a net increase in luminaire output even though the reduced wattage lamps are rated for less output
than are standard lamps.
