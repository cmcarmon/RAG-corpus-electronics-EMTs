Figure 4.2 illustrates a cross section of some common trans-
mission lines. The transmission lines are assumed to be uniform
along the direction of propagation, so discontinuity effects are
not considered in the ﬁeld distribution. All these lines, except
the microstrip, support electric and magnetic ﬁeld distribu-
tions, which are entirely transverse to the direction of propaga-
tion. Thus, they can be described mathematically in terms of
transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves. The microstrip line
has a small longitudinal ﬁeld component relative to the trans-
verse component because of ﬂux leakage across the air–dielec-
tric interface. Such a transmission line can be considered as
quasi-TEM. The coaxial line and the stripline are completely
shielded and do not have any leakage under ideal conditions.
