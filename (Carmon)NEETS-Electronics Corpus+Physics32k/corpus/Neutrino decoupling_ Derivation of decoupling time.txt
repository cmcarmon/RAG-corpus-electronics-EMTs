Neutrinos are scattered (interfering with free streaming) by their interactions with electrons and positrons, such as the reaction

The approximate rate of these interactions is set by the number density of electrons and positrons, the averaged product of the cross section for interaction and the velocity of the particles. The number density



n


{\displaystyle n}
of the relativistic electrons and positrons depends on the cube of the temperature



T


{\displaystyle T}
, so that



n

{\displaystyle n\propto T^{3}}
. The product of the cross section and velocity for weak interactions for temperatures (energies) below W/Z boson masses (~100 GeV) is given approximately by

ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the energy density of the universe. At this point in cosmic history, the energy density is dominated by radiation, so that



ρ

{\displaystyle \rho \propto T^{4}}
. As the rate of weak interaction depends more strongly on temperature, it will fall more quickly as the universe cools. Thus when the two rates are approximately equal (dropping terms of order unity, including an effective degeneracy term which counts the number of states of particles which are interacting) gives the approximate temperature at which neutrinos decouple:

While this is a very rough derivation, it illustrates the important physical phenomena which determined when neutrinos decoupled.
