is the
measurement process module. If we assume sources can char-
acterize their trafﬁc accurately using trafﬁc descriptors, the
admission control unit can simply use parameters in the trafﬁc
descriptors. It is observed, however, that real-time trafﬁc
sources are very difﬁcult to characterize, and the leaky bucket
parameters may only provide a very loose upper bound of the
trafﬁc rate. When the real trafﬁc becomes bursty, the network
utilization can get very low if admission control is solely based
on the parameters provided at call setup time. Therefore, the
admission control unit should monitor the network dynamics
and use measurements such as instantaneous network load
and packet delay to make its admission decisions.
