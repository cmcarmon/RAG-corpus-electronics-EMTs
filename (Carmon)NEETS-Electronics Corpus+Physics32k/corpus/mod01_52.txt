However, the big call for operators and technicians in the U.S. Navy came in the early part of the
20th century, when power sources, means of communication, modes of detection, and armaments moved
with amazing rapidity toward involved technical development. Electric motors and generators by then had
become the most widely used sources of power. Telephone systems were well established on board ship,
and radio was being used more and more to relay messages from ship to ship and from ship to shore.
Listening devices were employed to detect submarines. Complex optical systems were used to aim large
naval rifles. Mines and torpedoes became highly developed, effective weapons, and airplanes joined the
Navy team.
