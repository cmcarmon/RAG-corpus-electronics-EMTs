each  step,  check  that  the  voltage  is  exactly  1  V 
(adjust the signal generator output if necessary). 
  Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 4.26 (resonant 
circuit).  As  before,  set  the  voltmeter  and  ammeter 
respectively to the 2 V and 20 mA  ranges. Set the 
signal  generator  to  produce  a  sine  wave  output  at 
100 Hz.
