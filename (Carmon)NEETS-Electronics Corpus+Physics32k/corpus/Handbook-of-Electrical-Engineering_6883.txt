Thermal noise is the same in a 1000-W carbon resistor as it is in a 1000-W tantalum thin-ﬁlm resistor [see Ott,
1988]. While the intrinsic noise may never be less, it may be higher because of other superimposed noise (described
in later sections). We model the thermal noise in a resistor by an internal source (generator), as shown in Fig. 73.6.
Capacitance  cannot  be  ignored  at  high  f,  but  pure  reactance  (C  or  L)  cannot  dissipate  energy,  and  so  cannot
generate  thermal  noise.  The  white  noise  model W(t)  for  thermal  noise  N(t)  has  a  constant  psdf  SWW(w)  =  no
W/(rad/s) for –‘ < w < ‘. By Eq. 73.21, the white noise mean power over the frequency bandwidth B is
