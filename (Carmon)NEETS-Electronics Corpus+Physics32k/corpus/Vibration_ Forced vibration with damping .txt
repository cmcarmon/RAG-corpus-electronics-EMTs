The behavior of the spring mass damper model varies with the addition of a harmonic force. A force of this type could, for example, be generated by a rotating imbalance.

The plot of these functions, called "the frequency response of the system", presents one of the most important features in forced vibration. In a lightly damped system when the forcing frequency nears the natural frequency (



r
≈
1


{\displaystyle r\approx 1}
) the amplitude of the vibration can get extremely high. This phenomenon is called resonance (subsequently the natural frequency of a system is often referred to as the resonant frequency). In rotor bearing systems any rotational speed that excites a resonant frequency is referred to as a critical speed.
If resonance occurs in a mechanical system it can be very harmful – leading to eventual failure of the system. Consequently, one of the major reasons for vibration analysis is to predict when this type of resonance may occur and then to determine what steps to take to prevent it from occurring. As the amplitude plot shows, adding damping can significantly reduce the magnitude of the vibration. Also, the magnitude can be reduced if the natural frequency can be shifted away from the forcing frequency by changing the stiffness or mass of the system. If the system cannot be changed, perhaps the forcing frequency can be shifted (for example, changing the speed of the machine generating the force).
The following are some other points in regards to the forced vibration shown in the frequency response plots.
At a given frequency ratio, the amplitude of the vibration, X, is directly proportional to the amplitude of the force




F

0




{\displaystyle F_{0}}
(e.g. if you double the force, the vibration doubles)
With little or no damping, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio r < 1 and 180 degrees out of phase when the frequency ratio r > 1
When r ≪ 1 the amplitude is just the deflection of the spring under the static force




F

0


.


{\displaystyle F_{0}.}
This deflection is called the static deflection




δ

t


.


{\displaystyle \delta _{st}.}
Hence, when r ≪ 1 the effects of the damper and the mass are minimal.
When r ≫ 1 the amplitude of the vibration is actually less than the static deflection




δ

s
t


.


{\displaystyle \delta _{st}.}
In this region the force generated by the mass (F = ma) is dominating because the acceleration seen by the mass increases with the frequency. Since the deflection seen in the spring, X, is reduced in this region, the force transmitted by the spring (F = kx) to the base is reduced. Therefore, the mass–spring–damper system is isolating the harmonic force from the mounting base – referred to as vibration isolation. Interestingly, more damping actually reduces the effects of vibration isolation when r ≫ 1 because the damping force (F = cv) is also transmitted to the base.
whatever the damping is, the vibration is 90 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency when the frequency ratio r =1, which is very helpful when it comes to determining the natural frequency of the system.
whatever the damping is, when r ≫1, the vibration is 180 degrees out of phase with the forcing frequency
whatever the damping is, when r ≪ 1, the vibration is in phase with the forcing frequency
