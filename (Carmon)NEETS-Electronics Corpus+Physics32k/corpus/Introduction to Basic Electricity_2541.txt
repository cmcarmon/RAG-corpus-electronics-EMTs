The Bode plotter measures the ratio of magni-
tudes (voltage gain in decibels) between two points 
(V1 and V2). It also measures the phase shift (in 
degrees) between two points. A logarithmic base is 
used when the compared values have a large range, 
which is typical when analyzing frequency response. 
The horizontal axis, or xâ€“axis, always shows fre-
quency in hertz.
