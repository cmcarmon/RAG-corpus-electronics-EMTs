The only operating controls are a three-position selector switch and a push-button telegraph key. A 
hand crank screws into a socket in the top of the cabinet. The generator, automatic keying, and automatic 
frequency changing are all operated by turning the hand crank. While the hand crank is being turned, the 
set automatically transmits the distress signal SOS in Morse code. The code consists of six groups of SOS 
followed by a 20-second dash. It is transmitted alternately on 500 kilohertz and 8,364 kilohertz. The 
frequency automatically changes every 50 seconds. These signals are intended for reception by two 
groups of stations, each having distinct rescue functions. Direction-finding stations cooperating in long-
range rescue operations normally use 8,364 kilohertz, whereas aircraft or ships locally engaged in search 
and rescue missions use 500 kilohertz.
