inside the glass CRT. The electron gun generates electrons and focuses them into a narrow beam. The
deflection system moves the beam horizontally and vertically across the screen. The screen is coated with
a phosphorous material that glows when struck by the electrons. Figure 6-1 shows the construction of a
CRT.
