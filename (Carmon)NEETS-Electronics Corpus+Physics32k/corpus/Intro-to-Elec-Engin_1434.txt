in which the overbar represents the time average, and f (t) is assumed to have no dc component,
c /2R0 is the power in the carrier, and Pf = f 2(t )/2R0 is the added
as is the usual case. Pc = A2
power caused by modulation. Pf is called the useful power, since only this power caused by the
message contributes toward message quality. Pc, the carrier power, is not useful power in the
sense that it carries no information. However, it is important to the receiver’s ability to recover
the message with low-cost circuitry. Modulation efﬁciency ηAM of the transmitted signal is deﬁned
as the ratio of the useful power to the total power,
