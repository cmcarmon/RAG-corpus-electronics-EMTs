If the system is not homogeneous in a given volume the above (volume averaged) pressure is not a good measure for the pressure. In inhomogeneous systems the pressure depends on the position and orientation of the surface on which the pressure acts. Therefore in inhomogeneous systems a definition of a local pressure is needed. As a general example for a system with inhomogeneous pressure you can think of the pressure in the atmosphere of the earth which varies with height.
