Here, LS is the target-radiated signal strength (for passive) or transmitted signal strength (for active), and LN is
the total background noise level. NDI, or DI, is the directivity index, which is a measure of the capability of a
receiving array to discriminate against unwanted noise. NTS is the received echo level or target strength. Under-
water objects with large values of NTS are more easily detectable with active sonar than are those with small
values  of  NTS.  In  general,  NTS  varies  as  a  function  of  object  size,  aspect  angle,  (i.e.,  the  direction  at  which
impinging  acoustic  energy  reaches  the  underwater  object),  and  reﬂection  angle  (the  direction  at  which  the
impinging  acoustic  energy  is  reﬂected  off  the  underwater  object).  NRD  is  the  recognition  differential  of  the
processing system.
