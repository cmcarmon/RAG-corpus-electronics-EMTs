Slip Power Recovery Drive of Induction Motor
In a cage-type induction motor, the rotor current at slip frequency reacting with the airgap ﬂux develops the
torque. The corresponding slip power is dissipated in the rotor resistance. In a wound rotor induction motor,
the slip power can be controlled to control the torque and speed of a machine. Figure 30.49 shows a popular
slip  power-controlled  drive,  known  as  a  static  Kramer  drive.  The  slip  power  is  rectiﬁed  to  dc  with  a  diode
rectiﬁer  and  is  then  pumped  back  to  an  ac  line  through  a  thyristor  phase-controlled  inverter.  The  method
permits speed control in the subsynchronous speed range. It can be shown that the developed machine torque
is  proportional  to  the  dc  link  current  Id  and  the  voltage  Vd  varies  directly  with  speed  deviation  from  the
synchronous  speed.  The  current  Id  is  controlled  by  the  ﬁring  angle  of  the  inverter.  Since Vd  and VI  voltages
balance at steady state, at synchronous speed the voltage Vd is zero and the ﬁring angle is 90 degrees. The ﬁring
angle increases as the speed falls, and at 50% synchronous speed the ﬁring angle is near 180 degrees. This is
practically the lowest speed in static Kramer drive. The transformer steps down the inverter input voltage to
get  a  180-degree  ﬁring  angle  at  lowest  speed.  The  advantage  of  this  drive  is  that  the  converter  rating  is  low
compared  with  the  machine  rating.  Disadvantages  are  that  the  line  power  factor  is  low  and  the  machine  is
expensive. For limited speed range applications, this drive has been popular.
