RADIATION PATTERN.â€”The characteristic radiation pattern of a given array is obtained at the 
frequency or band of frequencies at which the system is resonant. The gain and directivity characteristics 
are lost when the antenna is not used at or near this frequency and the array tunes too sharply. A collinear 
antenna is more effective than an end-fire array when used off its tuned frequency. This feature is 
considered when transmission or reception is to be over a wide frequency band. When more than two 
elements are used, this advantage largely disappears.
