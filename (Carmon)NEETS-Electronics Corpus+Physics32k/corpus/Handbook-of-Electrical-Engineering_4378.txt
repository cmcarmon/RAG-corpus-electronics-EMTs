A  lightwave  communication  system  (Fig.  42.13)  consists  of  a  transmitter,  a  transmission  medium,  and  a
receiver.  The  transmitter  takes  the  coded  electronic  signal  (voice,  video,  or  data)  and  converts  it  to  the  light
signal, which is then carried by the transmission medium (an optical ﬁber cable) to either a repeater or the
receiver. At the receiving end the signal is detected, converted to electrical pulses, and decoded to the proper
output. This article provides a brief overview of the different components used in an optical ﬁber system, along
with examples of various applications of optical ﬁber systems.
