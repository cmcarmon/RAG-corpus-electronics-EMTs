Thus, the MLE for a DC signal embedded in additive zero
mean white Gaussian noise is the sample mean. As it turns
out, this sample mean is the sufﬁcient statistic for estimating
u. The concept of the sufﬁcient statistic is critical to the
optimum properties of MLE and, in general, to Fisherian
statistics. Generally speaking, the likelihood function is directly
related to sufﬁcient statistics, and the MLE is usually a func-
tion of sufﬁcient statistics.
