The dc shunt generators are often used as exciters to provide dc supply. The series generator
is employed as a voltage booster and also as a constant-current source in welding machines. In
applications for which a constant dc voltage is essential, the cumulative-compound generator
Ô¨Ånds its use. The differential-compound generator is used in applications such as arc welding,
where a large voltage drop is desirable when the current increases.
