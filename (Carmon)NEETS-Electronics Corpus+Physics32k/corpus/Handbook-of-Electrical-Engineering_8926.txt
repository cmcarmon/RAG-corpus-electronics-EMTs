Keyboards
Keyboards are essentially electromechanical devices, and are still ubiquitous, in spite of the inroads of other
input devices. The primary type of keyboard in use as an input device is the alphanumeric (A/N) form, well
known  in  its  typewriter  application,  but  with  various  additions  and  expansions  consisting  of  numeric  and
special  function  keys.  This  type  of  keyboard  is  shown  in  Fig. 89.1(b)  with  a  standard  QWERTY  format,  so
named because of the layout of the top left alpha keys, for the A/N portion, a separate numeric set to the right,
and a group of function keys at the top. Other layouts for the A/N portion have been proposed and at least
one (Dvorak) accepted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), but it has not received much use
in spite of its advantages in increased efÔ¨Åciency. At present, the overwhelming majority of system keyboards
still use the QWERTY layout, and it is the only one considered here.
