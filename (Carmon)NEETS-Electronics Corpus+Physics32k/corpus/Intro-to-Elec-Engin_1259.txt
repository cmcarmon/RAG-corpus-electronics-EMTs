13.3.13 A three-phase, wye-connected, cylindrical-rotor,
synchronous motor, with negligible armature re-
sistance and a synchronous reactance of 1.27 
per phase, is connected in parallel with a three-
phase, wye-connected load taking 50 A at 0.707
lagging power factor from a three-phase, 220-V,
60-Hz source. If the power developed by the mo-
tor is 33 kW at a power angle of 30Â°, determine:
(a) The overall power factor of the motor and
