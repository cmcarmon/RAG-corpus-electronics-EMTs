Resonant shorted lines, like open-end lines, also may act as pure capacitances or inductances. The
illustration shows that a shorted line less than 1/4 wavelength long acts as an inductance. A shorted line
with a length of from 1/4 to 1/2 wavelength acts as a capacitance. From 1/2 to 3/4 wavelength, the line
acts as an inductance; and from 3/4 to 1 wavelength, it acts as a capacitance, and so on. The equivalent
circuits of shorted lines of various lengths are shown in the illustration. Thus, properly chosen line
segments may be used as parallel-resonant, series-resonant, inductive, or capacitive circuits.
