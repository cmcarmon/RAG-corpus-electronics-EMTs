The Komar mass (named after Arthur Komar) of a system is one of several formal concepts of mass that are used in general relativity. The Komar mass can be defined in any stationary spacetime, which is a spacetime in which all the metric can be written so that they are independent of time. Alternatively, a stationary spacetime can be defined as a spacetime which possesses a timelike Killing vector field.
The following discussion is an expanded and simplified version of the motivational treatment in (Wald, 1984, pg 288).
