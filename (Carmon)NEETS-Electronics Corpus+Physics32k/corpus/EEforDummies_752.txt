Monostable multivibrator (one‐shot)
By configuring the 555 timer as shown in Figure 11-17, you can use it as a 
monostable multivibrator that generates a single pulse when triggered. This 
configuration is sometimes called a one‐shot. Without a trigger, this circuit 
produces a low (zero) voltage; this is its stable state. When triggered by clos-
ing the switch between pin 2 and ground, this circuit generates an output 
pulse at the level of the supply voltage, VCC. The width of the pulse, T, is 
determined by the values of R1 and C1, as follows:
