The design of embedded systems is a highly complex task due
to the tight interaction of their functional units, which, in
general, originate from several engineering domains. Gener-
ation and assessment of models play an important role in the
whole design process. When dealing with modeling issues,
questions about concepts,
representation, efÔ¨Åciency, and
accuracy have to be addressed.
