Voltage control is either (1) manual or (2) automatic. In most cases the process involves changing 
the resistance of the field circuit. By changing the field circuit resistance, the field current is controlled. 
Controlling the field current permits control of the output voltage. The major difference between the 
various voltage control systems is merely the method by which the field circuit resistance and the current 
are controlled.
