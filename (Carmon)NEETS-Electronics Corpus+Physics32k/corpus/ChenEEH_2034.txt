(1) The thresholded ﬂoating point checksum test is
used with the lower 24 bits masked in the checksum
comparison for matrix multiplication and 12 bits for
LU decomposition. The threshold of the ﬂoating
point checksum test component of
the hybrid
checksum test was chosen to correspond to masking
the lower 24 (12) bits, which guarantees almost
zero false alarm in matrix multiplication (LU decom-
position).
