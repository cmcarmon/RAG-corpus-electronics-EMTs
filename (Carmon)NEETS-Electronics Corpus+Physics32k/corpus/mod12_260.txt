Another application of fsk is at low and very low frequencies (below 300 kilohertz). At these
frequencies, keying speeds are limited by the "flywheel" effect of the extremely large capacitance and
inductance of the antenna circuits. These circuits tend to oscillate at their resonant frequencies.
Frequency-shifting the transmitter and changing the antenna resonance by the same keying impulses will
result in much greater keying speeds. As a result, the use of these expensive channels is much more
efficient.
