One method uses a vent on the cell to permit the hydrogen to escape into the air. A disadvantage of 
this method is that hydrogen is not available to reform into the electrolyte during recharging. This 
problem is solved by adding water to the electrolyte, such as in an automobile battery. A second method 
is to use material that is rich in oxygen, such as manganese dioxide, which supplies free oxygen to 
combine with the hydrogen and form water.
