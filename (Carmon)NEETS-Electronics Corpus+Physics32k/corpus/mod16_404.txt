Where conditions are such that the shipâ€™s structure cannot be used as the return path, one of the other
conductors (known to be good) may be used. For example, to check D, you can connect a jumper from
pin D to pin A of plug 1 (female) and the ohmmeter leads to pins D and A of plug 2 (female). This
technique will also reveal the open in the circuit.
