The origin of enamel tufts is not fully understood. It appears, however, that they may arise during enamel development in areas where enamel rods are crowded at the boundaries where they are bundled together, creating periodic weakened mineral reduced planes. These weaknesses then produce transient longitudinal cracks in the transverse plane of the developing enamel.
Their formation has been attributed to stress and are considered a form of defect. However, stress upon the enamel is not needed to produce them since they occur in impacted third molars that are not affected by biting forces.
