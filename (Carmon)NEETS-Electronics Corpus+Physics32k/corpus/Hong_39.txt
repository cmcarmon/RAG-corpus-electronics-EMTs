 
A  simple  low-pass  filter  circuit,  which  allows  low  frequency  signals  to  pass 
through the circuit while attenuating high-frequency signals, can be made using a resistor 
and capacitor in series as shown in Figure 3.2. The transfer function of this filter can be 
determined by analyzing the circuit as a voltage divider,
