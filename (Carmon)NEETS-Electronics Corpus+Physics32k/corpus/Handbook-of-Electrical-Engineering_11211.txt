Sophisticated  FM  cassette  recording  and  playback  systems  allow  clinicians  to  review  long  EEG  recordings
over a greatly reduced time, compared to that required to ﬂip through stacks of paper or observe recordings
as they occur in real time. Such systems take advantage of time compensation schemes, whereby a signal recorded
at one speed (speed of the tape moving past the recording head of the cassette drive) is played back at a different,
faster speed. The ratio of playback to recording speed is known, so the appropriate correction factor can be
applied to played-back data to generate a properly scaled video display. A standard ratio of 60:1 is often used.
Thus, a trained clinician can review each minute of real-time EEG in 1 s. The display appears to be scrolled at
a high rate horizontally across the display screen. Features of these instruments allow the clinician to freeze a
segment of EEG on the display and to slow down or accelerate tape speed from the standard playback as needed.
A time mark channel is usually displayed as one of the traces as a convenient reference (vertical “tick” mark
displayed at periodic intervals across the screen).
