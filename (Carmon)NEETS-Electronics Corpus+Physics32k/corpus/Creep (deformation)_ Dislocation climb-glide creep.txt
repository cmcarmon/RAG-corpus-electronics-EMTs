Dislocation climb-glide creep is observed in materials at high temperature. The initial creep rate is larger than the steady-state creep rate. Climb-glide creep could be illustrated as follows: when the applied stress is not enough to for a moving dislocation to overcome the obstacle on its way via dislocation glide alone, the dislocation could climb to a parallel slip plane by diffusional processes, and the dislocation can glide on the new plane. This process repeats itself each time when the dislocation encounters an obstacle. The creep rate could be written as:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\varepsilon }{dt}}={\frac {A_{CG}D_{L}}{M^{1/2}}}({\frac {\sigma \Omega }{kT}})^{4.5}}

where ACG includes details of the dislocation loop geometry, DL is the lattice diffusivity, M is the number of dislocation sources per unit volume,



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
is the applied stress, and



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
is the atomic volume. The exponent m for dislocation climb-glide creep is 4.5 if M is independent of stress and this value of m is consistent with results from considerable experimental studies.
