In accordance with both Newtonian mechanics and SR, three-acceleration or coordinate acceleration

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\left(a_{x},\ a_{y},\ a_{z}\right)}
is the first derivative of velocity




u

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\left(u_{x},\ u_{y},\ u_{z}\right)}
with respect to coordinate time or the second derivative of the location

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={\frac {d\mathbf {u} }{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}}

However, the theories sharply differ in their predictions in terms of the relation between three-accelerations measured in different inertial frames. In Newtonian mechanics, time is absolute by




t
′

=
t


{\displaystyle t'=t}
in accordance with the Galilean transformation, therefore the three-acceleration derived from it is equal too in all inertial frames:





a

=


a

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} =\mathbf {a} '}
.
On the contrary in SR, both




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
and



t


{\displaystyle t}
depend on the Lorentz transformation, therefore also three-acceleration




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
and its components vary in different inertial frames. When the relative velocity between the frames is directed in the x-direction by



v
=

v

{\displaystyle v=v_{x}}
with

{\displaystyle \gamma _{v}=1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}

or for arbitrary velocities

In order to find out the transformation of three-acceleration, one has to differentiate the spatial coordinates




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
and





r

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} '}
of the Lorentz transformation with respect to



t


{\displaystyle t}
and




t
′



{\displaystyle t'}
, from which the transformation of three-velocity (also called velocity-addition formula) between




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
and





u

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '}
follows, and eventually by another differentiation with respect to



t


{\displaystyle t}
and




t
′



{\displaystyle t'}
the transformation of three-acceleration between




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
and





a

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} '}
follows. Starting from (1a), this procedure gives the transformation where the accelerations are parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity:

or starting from (1b) this procedure gives the result for the general case of arbitrary directions of velocities and accelerations:

This means, if there are two inertial frames



S


{\displaystyle S}
and




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}
with relative velocity




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
, then in



S


{\displaystyle S}
the acceleration




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
of an object with momentary velocity




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
is measured, while in




S
′



{\displaystyle S'}
the same object is accelerated by





a

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} '}
and has the momentary velocity





u

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '}
. As with the velocity addition formulas, also these acceleration transformations guarantee that the resultant speed of the accelerated object can never reach or surpass the speed of light.
