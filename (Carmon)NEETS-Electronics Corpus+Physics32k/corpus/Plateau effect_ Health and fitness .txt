In fitness, the plateau is commonly referenced when a person's body no longer responds to certain stimulus because it becomes accustomed to it. Overcoming the plateau usually involves a change in the person's workout, including adding periods of rest, changing volume of exercises, or increasing/decreasing the weight used in strength exercises.
