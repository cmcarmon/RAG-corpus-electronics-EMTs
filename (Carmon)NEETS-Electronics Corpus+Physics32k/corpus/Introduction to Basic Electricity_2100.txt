In Chapter 13, the concept of connecting resistors in 
series was presented. Ohm’s law (presented in Chapter 14)  
is one of the most important concepts to understand 
because power formulas, voltage dividers, current 
 dividers, and so on can all be traced back to and solved 
by it. Ohm’s law states that the current through a circuit 
is directly proportional to the voltage across the circuit 
and inversely proportional to the resistance.
