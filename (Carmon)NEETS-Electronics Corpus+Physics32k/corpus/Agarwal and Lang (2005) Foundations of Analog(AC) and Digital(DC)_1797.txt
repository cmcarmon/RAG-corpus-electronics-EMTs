Notice that the voltage waveform in Figure 12.45 first increases and the current wave-
form first decreases. This corresponds to the observation we made earlier that the current
canâ€™t change direction within an inductor instantaneously. Thus, if we close S1 and open
S2 quickly, (for example, before t1, which is the instant that the inductor current goes
to zero as seen in Figure 12.46), we can accumulate more charge, and hence more volt-
age, on the capacitor during each cycle. In this situation, the waveform of the capacitor
voltage vOUT (where vOUT = vC) will look like that shown in Figure 12.47.
The value of the voltage vOUT at the end of the nth cycle can be calculated iteratively.
Let vOUT[n] denote the value of vOUT at the end of the nth cycle. In the first iteration,
we compute vOUT[1] = vC by substituting v0 = 0 and t = t1 in Equation 12.197. In
the second iteration, we compute vOUT[2] by substituting v0 = vOUT[1] and t = t1 in
