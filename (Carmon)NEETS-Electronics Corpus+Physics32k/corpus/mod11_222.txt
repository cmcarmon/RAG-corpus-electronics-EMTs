The basic theory of parametric amplification centers around a capacitance that varies with time. 
Consider the simple series circuit shown in figure 2-43. When the switch is closed, the capacitor charges 
to value (Q). If the switch is opened, the isolated capacitor has a voltage across the plates determined by 
the charge Q divided by the capacitance C.
