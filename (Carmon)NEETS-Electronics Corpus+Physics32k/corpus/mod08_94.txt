The formula for XC also shows that the value of capacitance (C) should be relatively high so that 
capacitive reactance (XC) can be kept as low as possible. So, when a capacitor is used as a coupling 
element, the capacitance should be relatively high so that it will couple the entire signal well and not 
reduce or distort the signal.
