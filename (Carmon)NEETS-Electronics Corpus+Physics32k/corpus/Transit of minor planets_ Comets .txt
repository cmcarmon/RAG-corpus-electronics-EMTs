Comets may also transit the Sun; for example, Halley's Comet transited on 19 May 1910.
Another example was C/1819 N1, the Great Comet of 1819, but occurrence of that transit was not known until after it had happened, when the orbit was calculated, and although some observers later claimed to have seen the comet transiting the Sun at the time, these observations seem dubious.
