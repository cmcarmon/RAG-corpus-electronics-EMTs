Organizing (also spelled organising) for structure is the act of rearranging elements following one or more rules.
Commonly, anything is considered organized when it looks like everything has a correct order or placement, and is in a specific location. But it's only ultimately organized if any element has no difference on time taken to find it. In that sense, organizing can also be defined as to place different objects in logical arrangement for better searching.
