To the ear, a bar may seem like one singular beat. For example, a fast waltz, notated in 34 time, may be described as being one in a bar. Correspondingly, at slow tempos, the beat indicated by the time signature could in actual performance be divided into smaller units.
On a formal mathematical level, the time signatures of, e.g., 34 and 38 are interchangeable. In a sense, all simple triple time signatures, such as 38, 34, 32, etc.—and all compound duple times, such as 68, 616 and so on, are equivalent. A piece in 34 can be easily rewritten in 38, simply by halving the length of the notes.

Other time signature rewritings are possible: most commonly a simple time signature with triplets translates into a compound meter.

Though formally interchangeable, for a composer or performing musician, by convention, different time signatures often have different connotations. First, a smaller note value in the beat unit implies a more complex notation, which can affect ease of performance. Second, beaming affects the choice of actual beat divisions. It is, for example, more natural to use the quarter note/crotchet as a beat unit in 64 or 22 than the eight/quaver in 68 or 24. Third, time signatures are traditionally associated with different music styles—it might seem strange to notate a rock tune in 48 or 42.
