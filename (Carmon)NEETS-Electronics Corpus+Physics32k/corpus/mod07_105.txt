When a pentavalent (donor) impurity, like arsenic, is added to germanium, it will form covalent
bonds with the germanium atoms. Figure 1-10 illustrates this by showing an arsenic atom (AS) in a
germanium (GE) lattice structure. Notice the arsenic atom in the center of the lattice. It has 5 valence
electrons in its outer shell but uses only 4 of them to form covalent bonds with the germanium atoms,
leaving 1 electron relatively free in the crystal structure. Pure germanium may be converted into an
N-type semiconductor by "doping" it with any donor impurity having 5 valence electrons in its outer
shell. Since this type of semiconductor (N-type) has a surplus of electrons, the electrons are considered
MAJORITY carriers, while the holes, being few in number, are the MINORITY carriers.
