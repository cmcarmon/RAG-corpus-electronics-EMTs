produced by the brain. Since 1924, when Hans Berger reported the measurements of rhythmic electrical activity
on the human scalp, it has been suggested that these patterns of bioelectrical origin may provide clues regarding
the neuronal bases for speciﬁc behaviors and has offered great promise to reveal correlations between patho-
logical processes and the electrical activity of speciﬁc regions of the brain.
