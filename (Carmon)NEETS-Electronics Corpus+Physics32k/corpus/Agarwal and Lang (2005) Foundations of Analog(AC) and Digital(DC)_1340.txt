(cid:1) Through our analysis of capacitors and inductors, and several simple circuits
that contained them, we have seen that these elements exhibit memory and
are capable of reversible energy storage. A simple experiment will illustrate.
As illustrated in Figure 9.53, charge up a capacitor by connecting it to a
power supply (position 1), then disconnect the supply (position 2). The
capacitor will ‘‘remember’’ the voltage of the supply for hours if a high-
quality capacitor is used. A similar experiment performed with a resistor
produces no memory; when the power supply is disconnected, the resistor
voltage instantly falls to zero.
