source is connected to a 12-volt lamp, the source sup-
plies a 12-volt voltage rise, and the lamp produces a 
12-volt voltage drop. All the energy is consumed in the 
circuit. If two identical 6-volt lamps are connected in 
series to the same 12-volt source (Figure 12-25), each 
lamp produces a 6-volt drop, for a total of 12 volts. If 
two different lamps are connected in series, such as 
a 9-volt lamp and a 12-volt lamp (Figure 12-26), the 
9-volt lamp produces a voltage drop of 9 volts, and the 
3-volt lamp produces a voltage drop of 3 volts. The sum 
of the voltage drops equals the voltage rise of 12 volts.
