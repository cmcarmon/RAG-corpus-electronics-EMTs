is the sum of the resistances
Note in Eq. (3.13) that the coefﬁcient of 
i1
in the ﬁrst mesh, while the coefﬁcient of 
is the negative of the resis-
i2
tance  common  to  meshes  1  and  2.  Now  observe  that  the  same  is  true
in  Eq.  (3.14).  This  can  serve  as  a  shortcut  way  of  writing  the  mesh
equations. We will exploit this idea in Section 3.6.
