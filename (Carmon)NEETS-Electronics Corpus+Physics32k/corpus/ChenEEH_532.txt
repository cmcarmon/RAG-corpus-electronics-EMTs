As can be seen from Figure 6.9, in Si, the drift velocity
saturates in high electric ﬁelds, as expected. In many com-
pound semiconductors, such as GaAs, InP, and InGaAs, the
electron velocity decreases with an electric ﬁeld in a certain
range of high electric ﬁelds. (In this range of the electric ﬁelds,
the electron differential mobility, mdn ¼ dvn=dF, is negative.)
In these semiconductors, the central valley of the conduction
band (G) is the lowest as shown in Figure 6.8. In high electric
ﬁelds, hot electrons acquire enough energy to transfer from the
central valley of the conduction band (where the effective mass
and, hence, the density of states is relatively small) into the
satellite valleys, where electrons have a higher effective mass
and, hence, a larger density of states but a smaller drift velocity.
As can be seen from Figure 6.9, compound semiconductors
have a potential for a higher speed of operation than silicon
because electrons in these materials may move faster. The
negative differential mobility observed in many compound
semiconductors can be used for generating microwave oscilla-
tions at very high frequencies.
