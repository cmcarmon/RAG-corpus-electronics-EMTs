Large-Signal Switching Behavior of a pn-Diode
When a forward-biased diode is switched from the forward into the reverse direction, the stored charge Qd of
minority carriers must Ô¨Årst be removed. The charge of minority carriers in the forward-biased unsymmetrical
diode is from Eqs. (22.55) and (22.58)
