Frequency Distortion
Ideally an ampliﬁer circuit should provide the same ampliﬁcation for all input frequencies. However, due to
the presence of energy storage elements the gain of the ampliﬁer is frequency dependent. Consequently different
frequency components have different ampliﬁcations resulting in frequency distortion. The distortion is spec-
iﬁed by a frequency response curve in which the ampliﬁer output is plotted as a function of frequency. An ideal
ampliﬁer has a ﬂat frequency response over the frequency range of interest.
