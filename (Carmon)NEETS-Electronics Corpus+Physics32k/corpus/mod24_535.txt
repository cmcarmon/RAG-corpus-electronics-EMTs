Initial power measurements at the detector (P0) and at the source monitoring equipment (PM0) are
taken before inserting the interconnecting device into the test setup. The test fiber is then cut at the
location specified by the end user. The cut results in a fiber of lengths L1 and L2 before and after the
interconnection device that simulates the actual system configuration. After interconnection, the power at
