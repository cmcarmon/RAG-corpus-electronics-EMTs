Each of the two NAND gates on the left functions as a NOT gate (or inverter). 
Each NAND gate ties the inputs together so that a low input produces a high 
output, and a high input produces a low output. The NAND gate on the right 
produces a high output when either or both of its inputs are low, which hap-
pens when either or both switches (SW3 and SW4) are closed. The bottom 
line is that if either or both switches are closed, the output of the circuit is 
high. Thatâ€™s an OR gate!
