 
When laying out the front panel of the equipment, 
it is important to bear in mind the basic principles 
of  ergonomic  design.  All  controls  should  be 
accessible.  They  should  be  logically  arranged 
(grouping  related  functions  together)  and  clearly 
labelled. Consideration should be given to the type 
rotary 
of  controls  used 
potentiometers,  push-button 
toggle 
switches). 
It  is  also  important  to  wire  controls  such  that 
 
their  action  follows  the  expected  outcome.  Rotary 
‘gain’  and  ‘volume’  controls,  for  example,  should 
produce  an  increase  in  output  when  turned  in  a 
clockwise direction. Indicators should operate with 
adequate brightness and should be viewable over an 
appropriate angle. Indicators and controls should be 
arranged so that it is possible to ascertain the status 
of  the  instrument  at  a  glance.  If  necessary,  a 
number  of  opinions  should  be  sought  before 
arriving at a final layout for the front panel; one’s 
own  personal  preferences  are  unlikely  to  coincide 
exactly with those of the ‘end user’.
