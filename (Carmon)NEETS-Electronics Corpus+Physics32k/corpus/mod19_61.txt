BACK PRESSURE ARM LIFT.Â—This method is an alternate technique used when other methods 
are not possible. Place the victim on the stomach, face to one side, neck hypo-extended, with hands under 
the head. Quickly clear the mouth of any foreign matter. Kneel at the victim's head and place your hands 
on the victim's back so that the heels of the hands lie just below a line between the armpits, with thumbs 
touching and fingers extending downward and outward. Rock forward, keeping your arms straight, and 
exert pressure almost directly downward on the victim's back, forcing air out of the lungs. Then rock 
backward, releasing the pressure and grasping the arms just above the elbows. Continue to rock 
backward, pulling the arms upward and inward (toward the head) until resistance and tension in the 
victim's shoulders are noted. This expands the chest, causing active intake of air (inspiration). Rock 
forward and release the victim's arms. This causes passive exiting of air (expiration). Repeat the cycle of 
press, release, lift, and release 10 to 12 times a minute until the victim can breathe naturally.
