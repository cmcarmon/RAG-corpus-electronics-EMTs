Origin of Bioelectricity
Cell  membranes  resemble  charged  capacitors  operating  near  the  dielectric  breakdown  voltage.  Assuming  a
typical  value  of  90  mV  for  the  transmembrane  potential  and  a  membrane  thickness  of  100  Å,  the  voltage
gradient across the membrane is 0.9 · 105 V/cm. A typical value for the capacitance is about 1 mF/cm2.
