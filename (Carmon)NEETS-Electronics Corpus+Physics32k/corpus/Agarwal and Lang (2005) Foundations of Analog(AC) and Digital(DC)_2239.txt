properties change dramatically. Add a part per million of a Group V element,
such as phosphorus, to the Group IV element silicon, and we obtain a crystal
that has many ‘‘mobile’’ electrons not involved in covalent bonds. Hence the
material is now a good conductor. We call this material n-type silicon (n stand-
ing for negative, indicating mobile negative charge carriers, that is, electrons).
Similarly, if we add small amounts of a Group III element such as aluminum
to the pure silicon, the resulting crystal will have a large deficit of electrons in
the bonding structure. One useful way of visualizing the effect of this deficit is
to imagine that we have created not a deficit of negative charges, but a surplus
of positive charges, which we call holes. (A hole is thus a convenient way of
representing the absence of an electron.) This is called p-type silicon, signifying
mobile positive charge carriers. Both n-type and p-type silicon are electrically
neutral, because the constituents were electrically neutral. But unlike pure sili-
con, both are relatively good conductors of electricity. You may recall the use
of both p-type and n-type silicon in the fabrication of MOSFETs.
