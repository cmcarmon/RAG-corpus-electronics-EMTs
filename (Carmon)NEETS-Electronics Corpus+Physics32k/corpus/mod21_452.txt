As a technician, you need not be concerned with designing coaxial transmission lines. It is, however,
our feeling that you should be familiar with the parameters that go into making a transmission line. It can
readily be seen by the above formulas that transmission lines cannot be randomly selected without
consideration of system requirements. NAVSHIPS 0967-000-0140, EIMB, Reference Data, section 3,
lists the characteristics of most common transmission lines.
