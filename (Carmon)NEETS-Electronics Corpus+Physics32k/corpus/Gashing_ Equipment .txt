Gashers are large, heavy-duty machine tools. They have horizontal and vertical slideways, precise indexing, large diameter ballscrews, and spindle drive motors up to 100 hp (75 kW). They are usually controlled via computer numerical control (CNC) or a microprocessor. While they are usually used for rough cutting, they are also sometimes used for finishing. For example, gashers are used for the production of large roller-chain sprockets.
