The composite-coil wattmeter uses the upscale torque, produced by the ac power being measured, in 
opposition to the torque produced by an adjustable dc current in a set of windings intermingled or wound 
within the ac windings. Greater reading precision is obtained with this method than is possible with 
straightforward wattmeters, and errors caused by elasticity of the spring suspension carrying the moving-
coil system are avoided. The torsion-head wattmeter is used to restore the movable coil to its original 
position after deflection and to remove the mutual inductance error.
