In an isotropic medium the thermal conductivity is the parameter k in the Fourier expression for the heat flux







q

k



∇

T


{\displaystyle {\vec {q}}=-k{\vec {\nabla }}T}

where






q
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {q}}}
is the heat flux (amount of heat flowing per second and per unit area) and






∇
→



T


{\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla }}T}
the temperature gradient. The sign in the expression is chosen so that always k > 0 as heat always flows from a high temperature to a low temperature. This is a direct consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.
In the one-dimensional case q = H/A with H the amount of heat flowing per second through a surface with area A and the temperature gradient is dT/dx so

{\displaystyle H=-kA{\frac {\mathrm {d} T}{\mathrm {d} x}}.}

In case of a thermally insulated bar (except at the ends) in the steady state H is constant. If A is constant as well the expression can be integrated with the result

{\displaystyle HL=A\int _{T_{\text{L}}}^{T_{\text{H}}}k(T)\mathrm {d} T}

where TH and TL are the temperatures at the hot end and the cold end respectively, and L is the length of the bar. It is convenient to introduce the thermal-conductivity integral
