Hence,  the  overall  gain  with  negative  feedback 
applied will be less than the gain without feedback. 
Furthermore, if Av is very large (as is the case with 
an operational amplifier, see Chapter 8) the overall 
gain  with  negative  feedback  applied  will  be  given 
by: 
 
G = 1/J (when Av is very large)  
 
Note,  also,  that  the  loop  gain  of  a  feedback 
amplifier is defined as the product of J and Av.
