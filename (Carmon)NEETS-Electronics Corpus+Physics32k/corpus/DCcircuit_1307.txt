An electromagnet is a piece of wire intended to generate a magnetic ﬁeld with the passage of
electric current through it. Though all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic ﬁelds, an
electromagnet is usually constructed in such a way as to maximize the strength of the magnetic
ﬁeld it produces for a special purpose. Electromagnets ﬁnd frequent application in research,
industry, medical, and consumer products.
