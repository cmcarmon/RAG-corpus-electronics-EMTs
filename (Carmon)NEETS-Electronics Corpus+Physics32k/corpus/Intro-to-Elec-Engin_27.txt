Part 1: Electric Circuits This part provides the basic circuit-analysis concepts and tech-
niques that will be used throughout the subsequent parts of the text. Three-phase circuits have
been introduced to develop the background needed for analyzing ac power systems. Basic notions
of residential circuit wiring, including grounding and safety considerations, are presented.
