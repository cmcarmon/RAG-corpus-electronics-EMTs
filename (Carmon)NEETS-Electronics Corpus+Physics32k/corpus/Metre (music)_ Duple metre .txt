In duple metre, each measure is divided into two beats, or a multiple thereof (quadruple metre).
For example, in the time signature 24, each bar contains two (2) quarter-note (4) beats. In the time signature 68, each bar contains two dotted-quarter-note beats. Corresponding quadruple metres are 44, which has four quarter-note beats per measure, and 128, which has four dotted-quarter-note beats per bar.
