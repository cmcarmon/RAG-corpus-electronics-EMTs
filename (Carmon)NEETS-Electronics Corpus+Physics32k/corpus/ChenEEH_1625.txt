This explosive growth of multimedia data accessible to users
poses a whole new set of challenges relating to data storage and
retrieval. The current technology of text-based indexing and
retrieval implemented for relational databases does not pro-
vide practical solutions for this problem of managing huge
multimedia repositories. Most of the commercially available
multimedia indexing and search systems index the media
based on keyword annotations and use standard text-based
indexing and retrieval mechanisms to store and retrieve multi-
media data. There are often many limitations with this method
of keyword-based indexing and retrieval, especially in the
context of multimedia databases. First, it is often difﬁcult to
describe with human languages the content of a multimedia
object (e.g., an image having complicated texture patterns).
Second, a manual annotation of text phrases for a large data-
base is prohibitively laborious in terms of time and effort.
Third, since users may have different interests in the same
multimedia object, it is difﬁcult to describe it with a complete
set of keywords. Finally, even if all relevant object characteris-
tics are annotated, difﬁculty may still arise due to the use of
different indexing languages or vocabularies by different users.
As recently as the 1990s, these major drawbacks of searching
visual media based on textual annotations were recognized as
unavoidable, and this prompted a surging increase in interest
in content-based solutions (Goodrum, 2000). In content-based
retrieval, manual annotation of visual media is avoided, and
