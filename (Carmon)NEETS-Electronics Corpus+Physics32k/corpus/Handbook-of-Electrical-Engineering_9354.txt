Color  may  be  achieved  in  several  ways,  depending  on  the  device.  Some  devices  use  multicolored  ribbons
with single print heads, multiple print heads with different ribbons, or overstriking to combine colors. Other
devices  use  color  pens,  spray  (e.g.,  ink  jet),  toner  (e.g.,  laser  printer,  electrostatic  plotters),  or  pigment  from
colored wax paper (e.g., thermal transfer).
