Outputs 
 
Having dealt at some length with input sensors, we 
shall  now  focus  our  attention  on  output  devices 
(such  as  relays,  loudspeakers  and  LED  indicators) 
and 
them. 
Integrated  circuit  output  drivers  are  available  for 
more  complex  devices,  such  as  LCD  displays  and 
stepper  motor.  Many  simple  applications  will, 
however, only require a handful of components in 
order to provide an effective interface.
