	
Are	you	familiar	with	FABS	or	Semi-conductor	fabrication	facilities?
FABS	are	places	where	circuit	designs,	even	complex	ones,	can	be	put	together;	they	are
usually	extensive	since	they	are	meant	to	accommodate	bulk	circuit	projects.	Inside	them
are	various	equipment	for	EDA,	which	is	why	circuit-production	is	rapid.
With	the	productivity	level	of	FABS,	semi-conductors	are	continuously	becoming	popular.
And,	since	semi-conductors	are	components	in	a	circuit,	circuits	grew	in	popularity,	too.
