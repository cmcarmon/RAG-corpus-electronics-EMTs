Circuits usually don’t look as neat and geometric as you might expect. The 
shape of a circuit is usually not important for its operation. What matters 
about any circuit — and what you should concern yourself with when build-
ing one — is how the components are connected, because the connections 
show you the path the current takes through the circuit.
