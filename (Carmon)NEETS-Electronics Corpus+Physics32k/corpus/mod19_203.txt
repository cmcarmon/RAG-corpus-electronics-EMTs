Baby N connector (BNC) series connectors are small, lightweight, and feature a quick 
connect/disconnect, bayonet-lock coupling. The connectors use small rf cables such as  RG-58/U or RG-
59/U  and operate up to peak voltages of 500 volts. Manufacture is under Military Specification C-3608A 
(MIL-C-3608A). Figure 1-25 shows three typical BNC connectors. Figure 1-26 shows you how to attach 
BNC connectors to coaxial cable. Table 1-14 indicates which BNC connector to use with what coaxial 
cable type.
