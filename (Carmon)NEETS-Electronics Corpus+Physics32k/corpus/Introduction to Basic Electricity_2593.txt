All current and voltage values are the effective 
 values. These values are used the same way DC values 
are used.
eXaMPLe:	 If an AC circuit has an effective voltage 
of 120 volts applied across two parallel resistors of  
470 ohms and 1000 ohms, respectively, what is the 
current flowing through each of the resistors?
