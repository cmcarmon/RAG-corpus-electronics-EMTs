One last technological recourse to try to alleviate the energy-
delay bottleneck is to embed the memories as much as possible
on-chip. This has been the focus of several recent activities,
such as in the Mitsubishi announcement of an SIMD processor
with a large distributed DRAM in 1996 (Tsuruda et al., 1996),
followed by the offering of the ‘‘embedded DRAM’’ technology
by several other vendors, and the IRAM initiative of Dave
Patterson’s group at U.C. Berkeley (Patterson et al., 1997).
