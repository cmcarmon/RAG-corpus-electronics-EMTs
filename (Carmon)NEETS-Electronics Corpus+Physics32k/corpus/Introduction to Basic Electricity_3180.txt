As with the diode, a barrier voltage exists within 
the transistor. In a transistor, the barrier voltage is 
 produced across the emitter-base junction. This voltage 
must be exceeded before electrons can flow through the 
 junction. The internal barrier voltage is determined by 
the type of semiconductor material used. As in  diodes, 
the internal barrier voltage is 0.3 V for  germanium 
transistors and 0.7 V for silicon transistors.
