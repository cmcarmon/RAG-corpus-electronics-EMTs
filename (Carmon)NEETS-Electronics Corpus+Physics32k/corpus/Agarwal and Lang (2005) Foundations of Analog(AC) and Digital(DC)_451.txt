Interestingly, the SPICE software package uses the node method to solve
circuits. The program takes as input a file containing a description of the circuit
topology and by systematically following the node method produces a matrix
equation such as that in Equation 3.27. It then solves for the vector of unknowns
Â¯e using standard linear algebraic techniques.
