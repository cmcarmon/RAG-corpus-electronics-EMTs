The constant factor rule in integration is a dual of the constant factor rule in differentiation, and is a consequence of the linearity of integration. It states that a constant factor within an integrand can be separated from the integrand and instead multiplied by the integral. For example, where k is a constant:




∫
k



d
y


d
x



d
x
=
k
∫



d
y


d
x



d
x
.



{\displaystyle \int k{\frac {dy}{dx}}dx=k\int {\frac {dy}{dx}}dx.\quad }
