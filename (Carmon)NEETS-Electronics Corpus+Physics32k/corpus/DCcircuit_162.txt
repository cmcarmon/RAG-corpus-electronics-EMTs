Although it may seem pointless now to have a device doing nothing but resisting electric
current, resistors are extremely useful devices in circuits. Because they are simple and so
commonly used throughout the world of electricity and electronics, weâ€™ll spend a considerable
amount of time analyzing circuits composed of nothing but resistors and batteries.
