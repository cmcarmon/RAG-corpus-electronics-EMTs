The  process  of  generating  the  solution  set  P(xk–1)  from  xk–1  is  to  be  interpreted  in  the  following  sequential
manner. First, the set Pm(xk–1) is found. This set consists of all signals possessing the mth attribute that lie closest
to xk–1 in the given signal metric. Next, the set Pm–1(Pm(xk–1)) is formed and consists of all signals possessing
the (m – 1)th attribute that lie closest to each of the signals in set Pm(xk–1). It is to be noted that although each
of the signals in Pm–1(Pm(xk–1)) possess the (m – 1)th attribute, they need not possess the mth attribute. This
process  is  continued  in  this  fashion  until  the  set  P(xk–1)  is  generated.  Finally,  we  arbitrarily  select  one  signal
from P(xk–1) to be equal to x k. When the individual projection mappings Pk are each point-to-point mappings,
the signal xk generated in this fashion will be unique.
