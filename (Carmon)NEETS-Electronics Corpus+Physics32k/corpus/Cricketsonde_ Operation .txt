In preparing the rocket for launch, the propellant chamber was first partially filled with acetone, then liquid CO2 was pumped in to a pressure of 400psi, being dissolved by the acetone in the process. After propellant charging was completed, the rocket was loaded tail-first into the launch breech, and a valved plug inserted into the nozzle. The launch chamber below the breech was charged with gaseous CO2 under pressure, and a launch tube added to the breech.
At launch, a valve released the gaseous CO2 to expel the rocket. As the rocket left the launch tube, the plug in the rocket nozzle dropped off, allowing the rocket's fins to be deployed and the propellent charge to be released through the nozzle. The propellent discharge lasted about two seconds, giving the rocket a velocity of about 550fps (167 meters per second) and about 75g's acceleration for a .75 lbs payload.
After the propellant was exhausted, the rocket coasted to apogee, obtained approx 13â€“14 seconds after launch (with a .75 lbs payload). A timer device then opened the parachute compartment, deploying the 5 foot parachute, and the rocket descended at about 10fps (3 meters per second).
