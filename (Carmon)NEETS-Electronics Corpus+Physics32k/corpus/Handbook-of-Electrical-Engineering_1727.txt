Figure 17.5 shows the essential components of an image compression system. At the system input, the image
is  encoded  into  its  compressed  form  by  the  image  coder.  The  compressed  image  may  then  be  subjected  to
further digital processing, such as error control coding, encryption, or multiplexing with other data sources,
before being used to modulate the analog signal that is actually transmitted through the channel or stored in
a storage medium. At the system output, the image is processed step by step to undo each of the operations
that was performed on it at the system input. At the Ô¨Ånal step, the image is decoded into its original uncom-
pressed  form  by  the  image  decoder.  Because  of  the  role  of  the  image  encoder  and  decoder  in  an  image
compression  system,  image coding  is  often  used  as  a  synonym  for  image  compression.  If  the  reconstructed
image is identical to the original image, the compression is said to be lossless. Otherwise, it is lossy.
