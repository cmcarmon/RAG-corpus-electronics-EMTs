Rehabilitation engineering lies at the interface of a wide variety of technical, biological, and other concerns. A
user might (and often does) put aside a technically sophisticated rehabilitation device in favor of a simpler device
that is cheaper and easier to use and maintain. The cosmetic appearance of the device (or cosmesis) sometimes
becomes the overriding factor in acceptance or rejection of a device. A key design factor often lies in the use of
 to accomplish the task adequately, given the extent of the resources available to solve
the 
the problem and the residual capacity of the client. Adequacy can be veriÔ¨Åed by determining that increasing the
technical  content  of  the  solution  results  in  disproportionately  diminishing  gains  or  escalating  costs.  Thus,  a
rehabilitation engineer must be able to distinguish applications where high technology is required from those
where such technology results in an incremental gain in cost, durability, acceptance, and other factors. Further,
appropriateness very much depends on location. What is appropriate to a client near a major medical center in
a highly developed country might not be appropriate to one in a rural setting or in a developing country.
