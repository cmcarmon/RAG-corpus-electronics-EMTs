We have compared the following programming paradigms: procedural, functional, declarative, and object-
oriented.  Procedural  programming  has  the  longest  history  because  the  Ô¨Årst  HLLs  were  based  on  low-level
abstractions that are procedural. FORTRAN, COBOL, C, and Pascal are classical examples of the procedural
languages.
