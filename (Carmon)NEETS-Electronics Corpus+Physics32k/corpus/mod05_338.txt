The speed of induction motors is dependent on motor design. The synchronous speed (the speed at
which the stator field rotates) is determined by the frequency of the input ac power and the number of
poles in the stator. The greater the number of poles, the slower the synchronous speed. The higher the
frequency of applied voltage, the higher the synchronous speed. Remember, however, that neither
frequency nor number of poles are variables. They are both fixed by the manufacturer.
