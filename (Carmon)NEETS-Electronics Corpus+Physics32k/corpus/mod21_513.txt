The leading and trailing edges of the radiated pulse-modulated signal must have a sharp rise time and 
decay time and a constant amplitude between them. Incorrect pulse shape will cause frequency spread and 
pulling, which results in less available energy at the frequency to which the receiver is tuned. The primary 
reason for analyzing the spectrum is to determine the exact amount of amplitude and frequency 
modulation present. The amount of amplitude modulation determines the increase in the number of 
sidebands within the applied pulse spectrum; an increase in frequency modulation increases the amplitude 
of the side-lobe frequencies. In either case, the energy available to the main spectrum lobe is decreased.
