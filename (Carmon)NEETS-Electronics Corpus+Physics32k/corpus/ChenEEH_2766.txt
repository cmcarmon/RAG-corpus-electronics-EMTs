To see these artifacts more easily, Figure 9.9(B) shows an
expanded view of the leading edge of the wave. Consider Ô¨Årst
the oscillatory jitter. Similar to the results shown in Figure 9.7,
the jitter is due to short-wavelength numerical modes in the
grid generated at the step-function wave front. According to
our dispersion theory, these numerical modes are poorly
