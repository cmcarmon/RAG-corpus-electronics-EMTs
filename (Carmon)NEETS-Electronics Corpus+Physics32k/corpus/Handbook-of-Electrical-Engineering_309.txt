The Ô¨Årst method involves the direct calculation of Zeq = ZT = ZN by looking into the terminals of the network
after all independent sources have been nulled. Independent sources are nulled in a network by replacing all
independent voltage sources with a short circuit and all independent current sources with an open circuit.
