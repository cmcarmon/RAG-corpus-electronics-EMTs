Initially, the material properties of semiconductor optical sources provided for optical emission in
the 850-nm wavelength region. An 850-nm operational wavelength avoids fiber absorption loss from OH-
impurities near the 900-nm wavelength. Light sources for 850-nm systems were originally semiconductor
LEDs and lasers. Currently, most 850-nm systems use LEDs as a light source. LEDs operating at 850-nm
provide sufficient optical power for short-distance, low-bandwidth systems. However, multimode fiber
dispersion, the relatively high fiber attenuation, and the LED's relatively low optical output power prevent
the use of these devices in longer-distance, higher bandwidth systems.
