The conventional radio station is a prototype of a broadcasting system in which a single transmitter sends
the same message to multiple receivers. Chapter 69 reviews the basic notions of modulation needed to match
the transmitted signal to the propagation and noise characteristics of the transmission medium and outlines
recent developments in systems for high-deÔ¨Ånition television (HDTV) and digital audio broadcasting (DAB).
The chapter on digital techniques emphasizes the coding techniques used to detect and correct transmission
errors (which are inevitable even if systems can be designed to reduce their frequency of occurrence). Since the
rate of pulse transmission over a channel can be maximized by having an accurate model for the channel, such
systems  are  improved  by  continually  readjusting  the  channel  model  as  the  characteristics  change  with  time.
This chapter also discusses adaptive equalizers that match electrical pulse shapes to changing channels.
