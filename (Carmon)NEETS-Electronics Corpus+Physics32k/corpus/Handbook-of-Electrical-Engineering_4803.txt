PZT: Generic name for piezoelectric materials of the lead (Pb) zirconate titanate family.
Remanent polarization: The residual or remanent polarization of a material after an applied ﬁeld is reduced
to zero. If the material was saturated, the remanent value is usually referred to as the polarization, although
even at smaller ﬁelds a (smaller) polarization remains.
