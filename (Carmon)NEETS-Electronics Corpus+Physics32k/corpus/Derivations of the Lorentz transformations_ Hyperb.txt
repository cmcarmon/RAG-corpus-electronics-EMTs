The Lorentz transformations can also be derived by simple application of the special relativity postulates and using hyperbolic identities.
Relativity postulates
Start from the equations of the spherical wave front of a light pulse, centred at the origin:




(
c
t

)

2


−
(

x

+

y

+

z

=

−
(

2



+

y

′

2



+

z

′

2



)
=
0


{\displaystyle (ct)^{2}-(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})=(ct')^{2}-(x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2})=0}

which take the same form in both frames because of the special relativity postulates. Next, consider relative motion along the x-axes of each frame, in standard configuration above, so that y = y′, z = z′, which simplifies to




(
c
t

)

2


−

x

=
(
c

t

)

2


−

x

{\displaystyle (ct)^{2}-x^{2}=(ct')^{2}-x'^{2}}

Linearity
Now assume that the transformations take the linear form:









x
′




=
A
x
+
B
c
t




c

t
′




=
C
x
+
D
c
t






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=Ax+Bct\\ct'&=Cx+Dct\end{aligned}}}

where A, B, C, D are to be found. If they were non-linear, they would not take the same form for all observers, since fictitious forces (hence accelerations) would occur in one frame even if the velocity was constant in another, which is inconsistent with inertial frame transformations.
Substituting into the previous result:

c
t

)

{\displaystyle (ct)^{2}-x^{2}=[(Cx)^{2}+(Dct)^{2}+2CDcxt]-[(Ax)^{2}+(Bct)^{2}+2ABcxt]}

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-1=C^{2}-A^{2}&\Rightarrow &A^{2}-C^{2}=1\\c^{2}=(Dc)^{2}-(Bc)^{2}&\Rightarrow &D^{2}-B^{2}=1\\2CDc-2ABc=0&\Rightarrow &AB=CD\end{aligned}}}

Hyperbolic rotation
The equations suggest the hyperbolic identity

{\displaystyle \cosh ^{2}\phi -\sinh ^{2}\phi =1.}

Introducing the rapidity parameter ϕ as a hyperbolic angle allows the consistent identifications

sinh

ϕ


{\displaystyle A=D=\cosh \phi \,,\quad C=B=-\sinh \phi }

where the signs after the square roots are chosen so that x and t increase. The hyperbolic transformations have been solved for:

+
c
t
cosh
⁡
ϕ






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=x\cosh \phi -ct\sinh \phi \\ct'&=-x\sinh \phi +ct\cosh \phi \end{aligned}}}

If the signs were chosen differently the position and time coordinates would need to be replaced by −x and/or −t so that x and t increase not decrease.
To find how ϕ relates to the relative velocity, from the standard configuration the origin of the primed frame x′ = 0 is measured in the unprimed frame to be x = vt (or the equivalent and opposite way round; the origin of the unprimed frame is x = 0 and in the primed frame it is at x′ = −vt):

{\displaystyle 0=vt\cosh \phi -ct\sinh \phi \,\Rightarrow \,\tanh \phi ={\frac {v}{c}}=\beta }

and manipulation of hyperbolic identities leads to the relations between β, γ, and ϕ,
