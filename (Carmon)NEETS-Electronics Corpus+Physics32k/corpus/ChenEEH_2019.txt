The susceptibility of the ﬂoating point checksum test to round
off inaccuracies can be largely mitigated by applying integer
checksums to various (linear) computations that are ‘‘mantissa
preserving.’’ This results in high error coverage and zero false
alarms because integer checksums do not have to contend with
the roundoff error problem of ﬂoating point checksums. The
integers involved are derived from the mantissas of the inter-
mediate ﬂoating point results of the ﬂoating point computa-
tion. To date, we have successfully applied integer checksums
(hereafter also called mantissa checksums) to two important
matrix computations: matrix–matrix multiplication and LU
decomposition (using the GE algorithm) (Assaad and Dutt,
1992; Dutt and Assaad, 1996). We will brieﬂy discuss the
general theory of mantissa checksums and how they are
applied to these two computations.
