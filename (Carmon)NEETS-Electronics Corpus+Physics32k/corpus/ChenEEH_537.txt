FIGURE 6.13 Recombination Processes According to Electron-Hole Pair Generation. The Ô¨Ågures show (A) direct (band-to-band) radiative
recombination, (B) radiative band-to-impurity recombination, (C) nonradiative recombination via impurity (trap) levels, and (D) surface
recombination. Figure adapted from Shur (1996).
