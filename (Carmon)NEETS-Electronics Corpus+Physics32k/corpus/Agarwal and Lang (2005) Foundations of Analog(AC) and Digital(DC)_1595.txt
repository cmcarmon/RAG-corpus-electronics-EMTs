What is the amount of energy dissipated by the resistor? Since the voltage
source supplies an amount of energy equal to CV2, and the amount of energy
stored in the capacitor is 1/2CV2, the remaining half of the energy supplied by
the voltage source must have been dissipated in the resistor. We can verify this
by explicitly computing the energy dissipated in the resistor as follows. The
instantaneous power for the resistor is given by
