There are a variety of different applications for trajectory optimization within the field of walking robotics. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving at a low speed and running is energetically favorable for moving at a high speed.  Like in many other applications, trajectory optimization can be used to compute a nominal trajectory, around which a stabilizing controller is built.  Trajectory optimization can be applied in detailed motion planning complex humanoid robots, such as Atlas.  Finally, trajectory optimization can be used for path-planning of robots with complicated dynamics constraints, using reduced complexity models.
