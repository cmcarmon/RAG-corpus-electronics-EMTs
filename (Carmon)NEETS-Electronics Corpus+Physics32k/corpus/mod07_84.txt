Up to this point in our discussion, we have spoken only of isolated atoms. When atoms are spaced
far enough apart, as in a gas, they have very little influence upon each other, and are very much like lone
atoms. But atoms within a solid have a marked effect upon each other. The forces that bind these atoms
together greatly modify the behavior of the other electrons. One consequence of this close proximity of
atoms is to cause the individual energy levels of an atom to break up and form bands of energy. Discrete
(separate and complete) energy levels still exist within these energy bands, but there are many more
energy levels than there were with the isolated atom. In some cases, energy levels will have disappeared.
Figure 1-5 shows the difference in the energy arrangement between an isolated atom and the atom in a
solid. Notice that the isolated atom (such as in gas) has energy levels, whereas the atom in a solid has
energy levels grouped into ENERGY BANDS.
