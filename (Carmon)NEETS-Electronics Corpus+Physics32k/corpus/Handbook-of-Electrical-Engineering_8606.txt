Both heap and stack provide a mechanism to obtain large (or small) amounts of storage dynamically. Thus,
large structures which are created only at run time need not have static space stored for them in programs that
are  stored  on  disk  nor  need  they  occupy  great  chunks  of  memory  when  the  program  does  not  need  them.
Dynamic allocation is very useful and all modern HLLs provide for it.
