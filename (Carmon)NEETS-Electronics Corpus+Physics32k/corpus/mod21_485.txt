Measurements peculiar to sideband technology also include special modulation-amplitude and 
modulation-distortion checks. If the sideband modulator is overdriven or mistuned or the associated linear 
amplifiers are improperly loaded or overdriven, spurious output frequencies are produced. These are 
harmonically related to the driving signals and can cause splatter over a large range of frequencies, thus 
causing interference to other transmitting stations.
