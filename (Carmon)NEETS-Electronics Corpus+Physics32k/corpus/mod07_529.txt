The purpose of a current regulator is to provide a constant current regardless of changes in the input 
voltage or load current. The schematic shown in figure 4-42 is that of a circuit designed to provide a 
constant current of 400 milliamperes. Voltmeters are shown in the schematic to emphasize the voltage 
drops across specific components. These voltages will help you understand how the current regulator 
operates. The voltage drop across the base-emitter junction of Q1 is 0.6 volt. This voltage is the difference 
between the Zener voltage and the voltage drop across R1. The 0.6-volt forward bias of Q1 permits 
proper operation of the transistor. The output voltage across RL is 6 volts as shown by the voltmeter. With 
a regulated current output of 400 milliamperes, the transistor resistance (RQ1) is 9 ohms. This can be 
proved by using Ohm's law and the values shown on the schematic. In this case, current (I) is equal to the 
voltage drop (E) divided by the resistance (R). Therefore: 12 volts divided by 30 ohms equals 0.4 ampere, 
or 400 milliamperes.
