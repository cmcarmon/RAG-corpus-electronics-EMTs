To conform to the convention that R  0 for passive conduc-
tors, the path of integration c is from the surfaces of higher to
lower potential through the conductor, and ds is in the direc-
tion of current, as shown in Figure 1.1. If the conductor in this
Figure is homogeneous with a cross-sectional area A, then
from equation 1.11:
