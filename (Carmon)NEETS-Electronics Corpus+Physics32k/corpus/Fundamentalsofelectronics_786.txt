As expected, the signal that emerges from the channel is corrupted, but does contain the transmitted signal.
Communication system design begins with detailing the channel model, then developing the transmitter and
receiver that best compensate for the channel’s corrupting behavior. We characterize the channel’s quality
by the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The ratios are computed
according to the relative power of each within the transmitted signal’s bandwidth. Assuming the
signal x (t)’s spectrum spans the frequency interval [fl, fu], these ratios can be expressed in terms of power
spectra.
