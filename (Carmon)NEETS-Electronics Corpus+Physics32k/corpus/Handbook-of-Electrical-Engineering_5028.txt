Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is an extraordinary dielectric in that below 120(cid:176)C it behaves as a ferroelectric. That
is, the electric displacement is both a function of the ﬁeld as well as its previous history. Due to spontaneous
polarization of the crystal, a dielectric hysteresis loop is generated. The dielectric constant is different in the x
and z axis of the crystal (e.g., at 20(cid:176)C, e¢ > 4000 perpendicular to the z axis and e¢ < 300 in the x-axis direction.
Porcelain  is  a  multiphase  ceramic  material  that  is  obtained  by  heating  aluminum  silicates  until  a  mullite
(3Al2O3 · 2SiO2) phase is formed. Since mullite is porous, its surface must be glazed with a high-melting-point
glass  to  render  it  smooth  and  impervious  and  thus  applicable  for  use  in  overhead  line  insulators.  For  high-
frequency applications, low-loss single-phase ceramics, such as steatite (3MgO · 4SiO2 · H2O), are preferred.
