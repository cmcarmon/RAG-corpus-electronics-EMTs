The hallmark electromagnetic properties of a superconductor are its ability to carry a static current without
any resistance and its ability to exclude a static magnetic ﬂux from its interior. It is this second property, known
as  the  Meissner  effect,  that  distinguishes  a  superconductor  from  merely  being  a  perfect  conductor  (which
conserves the magnetic ﬂux in its interior). Although superconductivity is a manifestly quantum mechanical
phenomenon, a useful classical model can be constructed around these two properties. In this section, we will
outline the rationale for this classical model, which is useful in engineering applications such as waveguides
and high-ﬁeld magnets.
