Information and Resource Sharing
The  success  of  LAN  computing  was  predictable.  It  started  with  the  basic  tenet  of  sharing  resources  and/or
information. The need to amortize and justify the purchase of expensive resources, such as printers and storage,
was an obvious factor which supported LAN growth. The need for knowledge workers to exchange data was
and is imperative. Furthermore, the ability to share applications supported the growth of network computing.
