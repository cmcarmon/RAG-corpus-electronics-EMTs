Now the top two Ewire voltage drops are of no effect to the null detector, and do not inﬂuence
the accuracy of Rx’s resistance measurement. However, the two remaining Ewire voltage drops
will cause problems, as the wire connecting the lower end of Ra with the top end of Rx is now
shunting across those two voltage drops, and will conduct substantial current, introducing
stray voltage drops along its own length as well.
