Traditionally sound-absorbing materials have been used quite effectively to reduce noise levels in
aircraft, amphitheaters, and other locations. An alternate way is to develop an electronic system
that cancels the noise. Ear doctors and engineers have successfully developed ear devices that
will nearly eliminate the bothersome and irritating noise (so-called tinnitus) experienced by
patients suffering from M´eni`ere’s disease. For passengers in airplanes, helicopters, and other
ﬂying equipment, a proper headgear is being developed in order to eliminate the annoying noise.
