While Lamb's analysis assumed a straight wavefront, it has been shown that the same characteristic equations apply to cylindrical plate waves (i.e. waves propagating outwards from a line source, the line lying perpendicular to the plate). The difference is that whereas the "carrier" for the straight wavefront is a sinusoid, the "carrier" for the axisymmetric wave is a Bessel function. The Bessel function takes care of the singularity at the source, then converges towards sinusoidal behavior at great distances.
These cylindrical waves are the eigenfunctions from which the plate's response to point disturbances can be composed. Thus a plate's response to a point disturbance can be expressed as a combination of Lamb waves, plus evanescent terms in the near field. The overall result can be loosely visualized as a pattern of circular wavefronts, like ripples from a stone dropped into a pond but changing more profoundly in form as they progress outwards. It should be noted always that Lamb wave theory relates only to motion in the (r,z) direction; transverse motion is a different topic.
