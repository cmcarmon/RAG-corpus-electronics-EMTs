13.4.21 A 10-kW, 250-V dc shunt generator, having an
armature resistance of 0.1  and a ﬁeld resistance
of 250 , delivers full load at rated voltage and
800 r/min. The machine is now run as a motor
while taking 10 kW at 250 V. Neglect the brush-
contact drop. Determine the speed of the motor.
13.4.22 A 10-hp, 230-V dc shunt motor takes a full-
load line current of 40 A. The armature and ﬁeld
resistances are 0.25 and 230 , respectively. The
total brush-contact drop is 2 V, and the core and
rotational losses are 380 W. Assume that stray-
load loss is 1% of output. Compute the efﬁciency
of the motor.
