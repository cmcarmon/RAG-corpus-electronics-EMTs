Deﬁnitions and Style of Computation
An ANN is an adaptive, most often nonlinear system that learns to perform a function (an input/output map)
from  data.  Adaptive  means  that  the  system  parameters  are  changed  during  operation,  normally  called  the
training phase
. After the training phase the ANN parameters are ﬁxed and the system is deployed to solve the
). The ANN is built with a systematic step-by-step procedure to optimize a
problem at hand (the 
performance  criterion  or  to  follow  some  implicit  internal  constraint,  which  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the
learning  rule
.  The  input/output  training  data  are  fundamental  in  neural  network  technology,  because  they
convey the necessary information to “discover” the optimal operating point. The nonlinear nature of the neural
network processing elements (PEs) provides the system with lots of ﬂexibility to achieve practically any desired
input/output map, i.e., some ANNs are
