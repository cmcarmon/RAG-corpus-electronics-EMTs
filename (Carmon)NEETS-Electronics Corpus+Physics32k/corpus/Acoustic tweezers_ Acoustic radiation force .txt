When a particle is suspended in the field of a sound wave, a so-called acoustic radiation force, which arises from the scattering of the acoustic waves on the particle, will exert on the particle. The studies of acoustic radiation forces on suspended particles have a long history. The force was first modelled and analyzed for incompressible particles in an ideal fluid by King in 1934. Yosioka and Kawasima calculated the acoustic radiation force on compressible particles in a plane wave field in 1955. Gorkov summarized the previous work and proposed equations to determine the average force acting on a particle in an arbitrary acoustical field when its size is much smaller than the wavelength of the sound. Recently, Bruus revisited the problem and gave detailed derivation for the acoustic radiation force.

As shown in Figure 1, the acoustic radiation force on a small particle results from a non-uniform flux of momentum in the near-field region around the particle,

which is caused by the incoming acoustic waves and the scattering on the surface of the particle when acoustic waves propagate through it. For a compressible spherical particle with a diameter much smaller than the wavelength of acoustic waves in an ideal fluid, the acoustic radiation force can be calculated by
