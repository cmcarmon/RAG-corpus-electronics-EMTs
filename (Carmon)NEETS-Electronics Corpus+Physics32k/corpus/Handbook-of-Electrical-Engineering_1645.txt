The Kalman Ô¨Ålter is a linear recursive algorithm that solves the least squares problem for time-varying linear
systems with non-stationary noise. It estimates the state of a linear dynamical system given linear measurements
corrupted by additive noise. It is an optimal estimator, assuming that the measurement noise is Gaussian, and
assuming that all other relevant probability densities are also Gaussian.
