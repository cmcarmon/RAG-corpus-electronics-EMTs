The multivibrator frequency modulator has the advantage over the reactance-type modulator of a
greater linear frequency deviation from a given carrier frequency. However, multivibrators are limited to
frequencies below about 1 megahertz. Both systems are subject to drift of the carrier frequency and must,
therefore, be stabilized. Stabilization may be accomplished by modulating at a relatively low frequency
and translating by heterodyne action to the desired output frequency, as shown in figure 2-14. A
1-megahertz signal is heterodyned with 49 megahertz from the crystal-controlled oscillator to provide a
stable 50-megahertz output from the mixer. If a suitably stable heterodyning oscillator is used, the
frequency stability can be greatly improved. For instance, at the frequencies shown in figure 2-14, the
