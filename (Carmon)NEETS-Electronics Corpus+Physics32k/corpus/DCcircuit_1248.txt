To store more energy in a capacitor, the voltage across it must be increased. This means
that more electrons must be added to the (-) plate and more taken away from the (+) plate,
necessitating a current in that direction. Conversely, to release energy from a capacitor, the
voltage across it must be decreased. This means some of the excess electrons on the (-) plate
must be returned to the (+) plate, necessitating a current in the other direction.
