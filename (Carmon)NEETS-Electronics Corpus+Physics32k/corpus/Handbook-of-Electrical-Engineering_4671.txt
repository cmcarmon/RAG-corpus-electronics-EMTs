There is also a secondary effect of apodization when attempting to extract energy. Not all of the power of a
nonuniform SAW beam can be extracted by an a uniform transducer, and reciprocally, not all of the energy of
a uniform SAW beam can be extracted by an apodized transducer. The transducer efÔ¨Åciency is calculated at
center frequency as
