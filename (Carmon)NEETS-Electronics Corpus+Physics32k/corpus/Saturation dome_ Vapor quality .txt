Vapor quality refers to the vapor–liquid mixture that is contained underneath the dome. This quality is defined as the fraction of the total mixture which is vapor, based on mass. A fully saturated vapor has a quality of 100% while a saturated liquid has a quality of 0%. Quality can be estimated graphically as it is related to the specific volume, or how far horizontally across the dome the point exists. At the saturated liquid state, the specific volume is denoted as vf, while at the saturated vapor stage it is denoted as vg.
Quality can be calculated by the equation:
