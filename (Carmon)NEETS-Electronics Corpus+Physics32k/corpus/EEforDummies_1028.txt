zontally in blocks of five called terminal strips, as indicated by the yellow 
lines on the photo in Figure 15-2. For instance, the holes in row 1, col-
umns a, b, c, d, and e are electrically connected to each other, as are the 
holes in row 1, columns f, g, h, i, and j. There are no vertical connections 
within these two center sections, so, for instance, hole 1a is not electri-
cally connected to hole 2a.
