water using various plumbing devices and other components? Some of the 
things you can do are restrict the flow, cut off the flow completely, adjust 
the pressure, allow water to flow in one direction only, and store water. 
(This water analogy may help but it isn’t 100% valid; you don’t need a 
closed system for water to flow — and you do need a closed system to make 
 electric current flow.)
