A special meter movement designed especially for power measurement is called the dy-
namometer movement, and is similar to a D’Arsonval or Weston movement in that a lightweight
coil of wire is attached to the pointer mechanism. However, unlike the D’Arsonval or Weston
movement, another (stationary) coil is used instead of a permanent magnet to provide the
magnetic ﬁeld for the moving coil to react against. The moving coil is generally energized by
the voltage in the circuit, while the stationary coil is generally energized by the current in the
circuit. A dynamometer movement connected in a circuit looks something like this:
