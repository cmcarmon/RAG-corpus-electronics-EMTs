where J is the current density at a given point within the filament. Note that
J is a vector. If we choose the surface of the filament Sx at the terminal x,
then we get the amount of current entering the filament. Alternatively, if we
choose the surface Sy at the y terminal, then we get the amount of current
leaving the filament. What can we say about the current entering and leaving the
filament?
