A transformer is a static device used for transforming electric
energy from one circuit to another magnetically (e.g., by
induction rather than conduction). Normally, this transfor-
mation is accomplished between circuits of different voltages of
the same frequency. A power transformer will have a magnetic
core surrounded by two or more windings. These windings are
insulated from each other and from the ground. The windings
