Self-mixing interferometry is a measurement technique, in which a laser beam is reflected from an object, back into the laser. The reflected light interferes with the light generated inside the laser, and this causes changes in the optical and electrical properties of the laser. Information about the target object and the laser itself can be obtained by analysing these changes in behaviour. The technique is also known as feedback interferometry, induced-modulation interferometry, or backscatter modulation interferometry.
