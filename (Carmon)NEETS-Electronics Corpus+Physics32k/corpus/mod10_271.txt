The attenuation that a surface wave undergoes because of induced voltage also depends on the 
electrical properties of the terrain over which the wave travels. The best type of surface is one that has 
good electrical conductivity. The better the conductivity, the less the attenuation. Table 2-2 gives the 
relative conductivity of various surfaces of the Earth.
