During  the  late  1960s,  many  forward-looking  thinkers  began  to  recognize  that  signiﬁcant  computing
resources (that is, supercomputers) would be expensive and unlikely to be affordable by many of the researchers
needing  this  kind  of  computer  power.  In  addition,  they  realized  that  signiﬁcant  computing  resources  would
not  be  needed  all  of  the  time  by  those  having  local  access.  If  the  computing  resource  could  be  shared  by  a
number of research sites, then the cost of the resource could be shared by its users.
