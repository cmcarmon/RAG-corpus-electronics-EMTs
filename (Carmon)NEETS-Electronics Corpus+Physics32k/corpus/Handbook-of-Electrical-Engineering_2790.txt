The  distance  over  which  the  clock  signal  can  travel  before  incurring  a  delay  greater  than  the  clock  skew
deÔ¨Ånes isochronous regions (illustrated in Fig. 25.35(a) as shaded regions) within the IC. If the external clock
can be provided to such regions with zero clock skew, then clock routing within the isochronous region is not
critical. Figure 25.35(a) illustrates the H-tree approach, whose clock paths have equal lengths to terminal points,
ideally delivering clock pulses to each of the terminal points (leaf nodes) of the tree simultaneously (zero skew).
In a real circuit, precisely zero clock skew is not achieved since different network segments encounter different
environments of data lines coupled electrically to the clock line segment.
