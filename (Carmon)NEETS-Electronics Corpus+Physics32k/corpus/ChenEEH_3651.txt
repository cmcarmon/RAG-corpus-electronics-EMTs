One of the main challenges in speech processing is that the
dynamics of the speech system are constantly changing. This
is evident in Figure 3.2. A conservative rule of thumb is that
speech frames remain quasistationary for intervals of 10 to
20 ms. Moreover, speech is not a string of discrete, well-formed
sounds but rather a series of steady-state or target sounds
(sometimes quite brief, if achieved at all) with intermediate
transitions. The preceding and/or succeeding sound in a string
can affect whether a target is reached, how long it is held, and
other ﬁner acoustic details. This interplay among sounds in an
utterance is called coarticulation. Changes witnessed in the
speech waveform are a direct consequence of movements of the
speech system articulators that rarely remain ﬁxed for any
sustained period of time. On the other hand, the articulators
have mass and cannot be moved instantaneously from one
target to the next without a period of transition.
