For  n  =  1,  the  intensity  is  constant—i.e.,  independent  of  angle.  For  l  >  L,  both  the  numerator  and
denominator of Eq. (38.32) have no zeros and as the length of an array shortens (relative to a wavelength), the
intensity pattern converges to a constant (n = 1 case). As shown in Fig. 38.9, a separation of l/4 has an intensity
rolloff  less  than  1 dB  over  p/2  radians  (a  l/2  separation  rolls  off  3 dB).  This  implies  that  placing  antenna
elements closer than l/4 does not signiﬁcantly change the intensity pattern. Many microwave antennas exploit
this and use a mesh or parallel wire (for polarization sensitivity) design rather than covering the entire aperture
with  conductor.  This  reduces  both  weight  and  sensitivity  to  wind  loading.  Note  that  the  analysis  has  not
accounted for phase variations from position errors in the element placement where the required accuracy is
typically better than l/10.
