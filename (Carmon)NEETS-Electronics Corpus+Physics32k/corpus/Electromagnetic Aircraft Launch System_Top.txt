The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), is a type of aircraft launching system currently under development by General Atomics for the United States Navy. EMALS launches carrier-based aircraft from an aircraft catapult using a linear motor drive instead of the conventional steam piston drive. EMALS was developed for the Navy's Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers.
Its main advantage is that it accelerates aircraft more smoothly, putting less stress on their airframes. Compared to steam catapults, EMALS also weighs less, is expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch aircraft that are heavier or lighter. It uses far less fresh water, reducing the need for energy-intensive desalination.
China is reportedly developing a similar system.
