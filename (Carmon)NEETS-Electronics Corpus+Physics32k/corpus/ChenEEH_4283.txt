WCDMA
The WCDMA scheme was developed as a joint effort between
ETSI and ARIB in 1997. The ETSI WCDMA scheme was
developed from the FMA2 scheme in Europe and the ARIB
WCDMA from the Core-A scheme in Japan. The uplink of the
WCDMA scheme is based mainly on the FMA2 scheme and
the downlink on the Core-A scheme. Table 7.2 lists the main
parameters of WCDMA.
