CCS can be perceived as a dynamically reconﬁgurable data
path for special-purpose tasks that cannot be efﬁciently imple-
mented by software. There have been several examples of
CCSs,
including CHAMP (Patriguin and Gurevich, 1995),
national adaptive processing architecture (NAPA) (Rupp
et al., 1998), and Splash-2 (Buell et al., 1996).
