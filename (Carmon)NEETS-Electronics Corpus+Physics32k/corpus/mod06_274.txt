You might think that a grid with a negative potential placed close to the plate would interfere with
the electron stream. However, this is not the case. Because the suppressor grid is negatively charged, it
will not draw grid current. Additionally, the wide spacing within the mesh of the suppressor and its
location between two positive elements of the tube ensures that the suppressor gridâ€™s effect on the electron
stream will be minimum. Only the electrons emitted by secondary emission from the plate are affected by
the suppressor grid.
