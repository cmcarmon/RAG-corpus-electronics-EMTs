It  is  to  be  noted  that  the  vector  u  used  in  this  linear  variety  formulation  is  not  unique.  In  fact,  any  vector
contained  in V  could  have  been  used  in  place  of u. When  subspace  C  is  closed,  there  exists  a  unique  vector
contained in V of minimum norm that is of particular interest in many applications. It is formally speciÔ¨Åed by
