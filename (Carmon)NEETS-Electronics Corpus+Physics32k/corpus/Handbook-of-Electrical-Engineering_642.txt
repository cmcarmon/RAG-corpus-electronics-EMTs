A further advantage results from the fact that the reference- and information-bearing sample functions pass
through the same channel, thereby rendering the modulation scheme insensitive to channel distortion. DCSK
can also operate over a time-varying channel if the parameters of the channel remain constant for half the bit
duration T.
