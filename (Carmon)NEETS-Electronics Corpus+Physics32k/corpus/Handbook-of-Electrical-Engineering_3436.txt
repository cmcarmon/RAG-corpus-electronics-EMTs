 A/D conversion process where the analog signal is sampled at
rates much higher (typically 64 times) than the sampling rates that would be required with a Nyquist
converter. Sigma-delta modulators integrate the analog signal before performing the delta modulation.
The integral of the analog signal is encoded rather than the change in the analog signal, as is the case
for traditional delta modulation. A digital sample rate reduction ﬁlter (also called a digital decimation
ﬁlter) is used to provide an output sampling rate at twice the Nyquist frequency of the signal. The overall
result of oversampling and digital sample rate reduction is greater resolution and less distortion compared
to a Nyquist converter process.
