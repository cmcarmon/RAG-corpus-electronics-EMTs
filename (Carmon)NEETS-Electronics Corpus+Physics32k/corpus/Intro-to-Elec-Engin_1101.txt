Let us assume that the rotor is turning at a steady speed of n r/min in the same direction as
the rotating stator ﬁeld. Let the synchronous speed of the stator ﬁeld be n1 r/min, as given by
Equation (12.2.9), corresponding to the applied stator frequency fs Hz, or ωs rad/s. It is convenient
to introduce the concept of per-unit slip S given by
