The mechanism by which optical detectors convert optical power into electrical current requires
knowledge of semiconductor material and device properties. As stated in chapter 6, providing a complete
description of these properties is beyond the scope of this manual. In this chapter we only discuss the
general properties of semiconductor PINs and APDs.
