A MESFET is very similar to a metal-semiconductor Ô¨Åeld
transistor (MOSFET). The main difference is that
effect
the MOS gate is replaced by a metal-
in a MESFET,
(Schottky)
semiconductor
junction. A self-aligned GaAs
MESFET structure is shown in Figure 3.21. The heavily
doped source and drain junctions are formed in an n-type
epitaxial layer formed on semi-insulating GaAs, which pro-
vides low parasitic capacitance. The n-type channel region has
a thickness, a, which is typically less than 200 nm. The source
