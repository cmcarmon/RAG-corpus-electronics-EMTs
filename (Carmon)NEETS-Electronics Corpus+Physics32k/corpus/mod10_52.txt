Basic wave motion can be shown by dropping a stone into a pool of water (see figure 1-1). As the
stone enters the water, a surface disturbance is created, resulting in an expanding series of circular waves.
Figure 1-2 is a diagram of this action. View A shows the falling stone just an instant before it strikes the
water. View B shows the action taking place at the instant the stone strikes the surface, pushing the water
that is around it upward and outward. In view C, the stone has sunk deeper into the water, which has
closed violently over it causing some spray, while the leading wave has moved outward. An instant later,
the stone has sunk out of sight, leaving the water disturbed as shown in view D. Here the leading wave
has continued to move outward and is followed by a series of waves gradually diminishing in amplitude.
Meanwhile, the disturbance at the original point of contact has gradually subsided.
