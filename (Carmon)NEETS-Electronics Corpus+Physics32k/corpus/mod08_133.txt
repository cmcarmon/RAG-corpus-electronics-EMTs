Negative feedback is used to improve fidelity of an amplifier by limiting the input signal. Negative 
feedback can also be used to increase the frequency response of an amplifier. The gain of an amplifier 
decreases when the limit of its frequency response is reached. When negative feedback is used, the 
feedback signal decreases as the output signal decreases. At the limits of frequency response of the 
amplifier the smaller feedback signal means that the effective gain (gain with feedback) is increased. This 
will improve the frequency response of the amplifier.
