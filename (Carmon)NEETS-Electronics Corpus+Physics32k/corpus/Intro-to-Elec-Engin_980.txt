when a current-carrying conductor of length l is located in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂux
density B, and the direction of the current in the conductor is perpendicular to the direction of the
magnetic ﬁeld. The direction of the force is orthogonal (perpendicular) to the directions of both
the current-carrying conductor and the magnetic ﬁeld. Equation (12.1.4) is often used in electric
machine analysis.
