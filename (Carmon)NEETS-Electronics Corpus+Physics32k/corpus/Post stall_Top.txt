In aircraft flight dynamics, post stall is a flight condition in which the aircraft velocity has become lower than stall speed, in order to overcome stalling in the aircraft. In this state —below the low-velocity limit of the flight domain— the wings no longer provide enough lift to compensate the aircraft weight. Some aircraft, such as fighter jets, have enough engine thrust to maintain flight at those speeds. Normal flight controls, such as ailerons and elevators, may then no longer be sufficient to maintain full control of the aircraft.
