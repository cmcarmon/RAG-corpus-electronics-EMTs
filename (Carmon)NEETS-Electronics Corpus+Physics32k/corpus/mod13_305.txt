One method of constructing a full adder is to use two half adders and an OR gate as shown in figure
3-8. The inputs A and B are applied to gates 1 and 2. These make up one half adder. The sum output of
this half adder and the carry-from a previous circuit become the inputs to the second half adder. The carry
from each half adder is applied to gate 5 to produce the carry-out for the circuit.
