where  e(k)  ∆  x(k)  – ˆx(k)  and  e(t)  ∆  x(t)  – ˆx(t).  Thus,  the  size  of  these  matrices  is  an  indicator  of  the  error
variance in various components in the estimates, and it can be seen in Eq. (100.161) and (100.167) that as these
covariances decrease, the estimators rely less and less on the innovations term and more on the system dynamics
for an accurate estimate. Early in the estimation process, the situation is usually reversed, with the innovations
having the larger effect.
