The static output characteristics of the BJT has three distinct
regimes of conduction. From its off-state current, the transis-
tor enters a forward active region when the base–emitter (B–E)
junction is forward biased by a base current. With the base-
collector (B–C) junction reverse biased, a collector current of
magnitude bF IB ﬂows through the device. For the same base
current, if the collector voltage is reduced such that the B–C
junction is barely forward biased, the device enters the quasi-
saturation mode of operation. The boundary for this transi-
tion is VCE ¼ VBE, on þ IC RD, where RD is the resistance of the
drift region. Forward biasing the B–C junction results in mi-
nority carrier injection into the collector drift region. The
increase in effective base width reduces the transistor current
gain and, hence, the collector current. The device conducts in
hard saturation when the entire collector drift region is in
high-level
injection. Any additional reduction in collector
voltage drives the transistor further into hard saturation. The
transistor has very little on-state voltage in hard saturation and
quasisaturation and is operated in this condition for practical
application.
