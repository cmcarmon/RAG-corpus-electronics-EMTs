To capture hominal behavior analytically, a framework delineating the intrinsic features of a C3 environment
is  required. At  the  macrolevel,  the  important  attributes  of  a  command  and  control  environment  are  tempo,
uncertainty,  and  complexity.  The  mission  directed  decisionmaker  model  (MDDM)  described  in  Clapp  and
Sworder [1992] decomposes the C2 model in the hybrid form suggested by Athans. One block in the MDDM,
the stimulus-hypothesis evaluation model (SHEM), quantiÔ¨Åes relevant features of an engagement while repre-
senting  the  observation  and  situation  assessment  tendencies  of  the  decisionmaker  in  terms  of  a  few  natural
parameters. Because of its simple structure, the SHEM lends itself to the analysis of systems containing human
decisionmakers.
