The quantities containing noise terms cause errors in the receiver’s decision-making process. Because they
involve noise, the values of these integrals are random quantities drawn from some probability distribution
that vary erratically from bit interval to bit interval. Because the noise has zero average value and has an
equal amount of power in all frequency bands, the values of the integrals will hover about zero. What is
important is how much they vary. If the noise is such that its integral term is more negative than αA2T ,
then the receiver will make an error, deciding that the transmitted zero-valued bit was indeed a one. The
probability that this situation occurs depends on three factors:
