The latest versions of communications satellites use a stationary platform with four high-gain 
antennas. Two steerable narrow beam antennas are used for communications between and within regions 
of high traffic density. Two horn antennas provide for earth communications between facilities outside 
the narrow beam coverage. The antenna arrangement for these types of communications satellites is 
shown in figure 4-7.
