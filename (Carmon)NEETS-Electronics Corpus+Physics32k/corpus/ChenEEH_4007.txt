. A CORDIC arithmetic processor performing polar to
Cartesian coordinate transformation is
reported by
Andraka (1998). The 52-MHz CORDIC processor fea-
tures pipelined 14-bit 5 iterations per transformation
and occupies only 50% of a Xilinx XC4013E-2 FPGA.
. An 8  8-pixel 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) im-
plementation is reported (Woods et al., 1996). The 2-D
DCT is separated into two passes of 1-D DCT, each
consisting of bit-serial arithmetic 12 multipliers and 32
adders/subtractors. The 2-D DCT consumes about 70%
of a Xilinx XC6216 FPGA. At maximum clock frequency
of 38 MHz, it can achieve 30 frames/second at 720  480
pixels.
