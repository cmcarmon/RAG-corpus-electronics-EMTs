of thermally activated electrons can be thermally excited to move from the valence to the conduction band and
that under the inﬂuence of an external ﬁeld they will be impelled to move in the direction of the ﬁeld, colliding
with the lattice of the crystalline dielectric and dissipating their energy by phonon interactions [Bartnikas and
Eichhorn, 1983]. Accordingly, breakdown is said to occur when the average rate of energy gain by the electrons,
A(E, T, Te, j), exceeds that lost in collisions with the lattice, B(T, Te, j). Hence, the breakdown criterion can
be stated as
