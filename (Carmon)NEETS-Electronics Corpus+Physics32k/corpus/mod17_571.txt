Antenna designs vary with the amount and type of land available, desired signal coverage, and 
bandwidth requirements. Figure 5-2 shows a simplified transmit antenna. The Navy uses TOP-HAT (flat-
top) capacitive loading with one or more radiating elements. Typical top hat antennas consist of two or 
more lengths of wire parallel to each other and to the ground, each fed at or near its mid point. The 
lengths of wire are usually supported by vertical towers. These antennas may take many shapes. The 
matching network shown is in the helix house. Figure 5-3 shows the installation at the naval 
communications unit in Cutler, Maine. The Navy has several of these types of installations. They are used 
primarily for fleet broadcasts and have power outputs in the .25- to 2-megahertz range. You should notice 
the transmitter, the location of the helix houses, and the dual antennas. You should also notice the 
transmission line tunnel. It is underground and over a half-mile long. Figure 5-4, view (A) and view (B), 
shows another antenna configuration. This array of monopoles (quarter-wave, vertically polarized stubs) 
is referred to as a TRIATIC antenna. A triatic antenna is a special form of a rhombic-arranged monopole 
array. This type of array is designed to transmit from a particular location. Triatics are all basically the 
same but have some design differences at each site. The physical differences compensate for differences 
in terrain. Now that we have looked at the transmit side, let's look at the receive side.
