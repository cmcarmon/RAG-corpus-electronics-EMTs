(reset) of the 555 timer goes low.
If the transistor is not conducting current, no current is flowing through 
resistor R2, so the voltage drop across R2 is 0, and the voltage where the 
collector of transistor Q1 (that is, the terminal on the lower right side of 
the transistor in Figure 17-4) meets pin 4 of the 555 timer is 0.
