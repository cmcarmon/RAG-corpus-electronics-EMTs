Video Broadcast
Video  broadcast  over  satellite  is  attractive  for  industry  segments  such  as  educational  TV,  distance  learning,
business television, and television receive-only (TVRO) applications. Business television allows users to transmit
broadcast-quality video programming from a studio to any number of speciÔ¨Åed locations equipped with TVROs.
A video broadcast capability, as an overlay to interactive data networks, is becoming increasingly popular for
corporate presentations, education, and training.
