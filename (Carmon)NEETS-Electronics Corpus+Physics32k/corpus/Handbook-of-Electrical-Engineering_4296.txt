Police Radars
Down-the-road police radars, which are of the CW Doppler type, operate at 10.525, 24.150, or in the 33.4 to
36.0 GHz range, frequencies approved in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. Half-
power  beamwidths  are  typically  in  the  0.21  to  0.31  radian  range.  The  sensitivity  is  usually  good  enough  to
provide  a  range  exceeding  800  meters.  Target  size  has  a  dynamic  range  of  30  dB  (from  smallest  cars  or
motorcycles to large trucks). This means that a large target can be seen well outside the antenna 3-dB point at
a  range  exceeding  the  range  of  a  smaller  target  near  the  center  of  the  beam.  Thus  there  can  be  uncertainty
about which vehicle is the target. Fisher [1992] has given a discussion of a number of the limitations of these
systems, but in spite of these factors probably a hundred thousand have been built.
