As figure 2-3 illustrates, the opposite condition is also true. An electron traveling in the same 
direction as the electrostatic lines of force will decelerate by giving up energy to the field. The negatively 
charged body will repel the electron and cause it to decrease in velocity. When the velocity is reduced, the 
energy level is also reduced. The energy lost by the electron is gained by the electrostatic field.
