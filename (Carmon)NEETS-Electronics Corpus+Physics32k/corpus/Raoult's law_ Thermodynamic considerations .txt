Raoult's law was originally discovered as an idealised experimental law. Using Raoult's law as the definition of an ideal solution, it is possible to deduce that the chemical potential of each component of the liquid is given by

{\displaystyle \mu _{i}=\mu _{i}^{\star }+RT\ln x_{i}\,}
,
where




μ

i


⋆




{\displaystyle \mu _{i}^{\star }}
is the chemical potential of component i in the pure state. This equation for the chemical potential may then be used to derive other thermodynamic properties of an ideal solution. (see Ideal solution)
However, a more fundamental thermodynamic definition of an ideal solution is one in which the chemical potential of each component is given by the above formula. Assuming also that the vapor mixture acts as an ideal gas, it is then possible to re-derive Raoult's law as follows.
If the system is at equilibrium, then the chemical potential of the component i must be the same in the liquid solution and in the vapor above it. That is,

{\displaystyle \mu _{i,{\rm {liq}}}=\mu _{i,{\rm {vap}}}.\,}

Assuming the liquid is an ideal solution, and using the formula for the chemical potential of a gas, gives:
