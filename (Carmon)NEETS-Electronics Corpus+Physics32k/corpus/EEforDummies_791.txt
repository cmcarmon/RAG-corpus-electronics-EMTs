Many schematics use the symbol for a cell to represent 
a battery. Cells are relatively lightweight and portable, 
and by combining multiple cells in series, you can 
create a variety of DC voltage sources. Everyday cells, 
such as garden‐variety AAA‐, AA‐, C‐, and D‐cells, all pro-
duce about 1.5 volts each. A 9‐volt battery (sometimes 
called a transistor battery or PP3 battery) is shaped like a 3‐D rectangle and 
ordinarily contains six 1.5‐volt cells. (Some cheap brands may contain only 
five 1.5‐volt cells.) A lantern battery (a big boxy thing that can power a flash-
light the size of a boom box) produces about 6 volts.
