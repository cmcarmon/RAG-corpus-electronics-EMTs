(16.2.17)
where cf(t) represents the transient response of the output variable with feedback. Comparing
Equations (16.2.15) and (16.2.17), it is clear that the time constant with feedback is smaller by
the factor 1/(1 + H K), and hence the transient decays faster.
By treating the differential operator p as the sinusoidal frequency variable jω, i.e., p = j ω =
j (1/τ ), it follows from Equation (16.2.14) that the bandwidth of the open-loop system spreads
over a range from zero to a frequency of 1/τ rad/s. On the other hand, for the system with feedback,
Equation (16.2.16) reveals that the bandwidth spreads from zero to (1 + H K)/τ rad/s, showing
that the bandwidth has been augmented by increasing the upper frequency limit by 1 + KH .
