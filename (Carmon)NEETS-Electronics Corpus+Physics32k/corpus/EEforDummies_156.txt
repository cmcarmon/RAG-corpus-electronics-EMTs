The lines in the circuit diagram show how the circuit components are con-
nected, using wire or other connectors. (I discuss various kinds of wire and 
connectors in Chapter 12.) Electronic components are usually made with 
leads — protruding wires connected to the innards of the component that 
provide the means to connect the component to other circuit elements.
