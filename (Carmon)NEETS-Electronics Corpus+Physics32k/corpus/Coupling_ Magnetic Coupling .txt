A magnetic coupling uses magnetic forces to transmit the power from one shaft to the other without any contact, this allows for full medium separation. Therefore can provide the ability to hermetically separate two areas whilst continuing to transmit mechanical power from one to the other making these couplings ideal for applications where prevention of cross contamination is essential.
