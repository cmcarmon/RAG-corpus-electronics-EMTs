The sum 11112 is the binary equivalent of 1510; however, 1111 is not a valid BCD number. You
cannot exceed 1001 in BCD, so a correction factor must be made. To do this, you add 610 (0110BCD) to the
sum of the two numbers. The "add 6" correction factor is added to any BCD group larger than 10012.
Remember, there is no 10102, 10112, 11002, 11012, 11102, or 11112 in BCD:
