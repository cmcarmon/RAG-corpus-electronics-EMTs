One of the most difﬁcult problems for band-pass ﬁlters
(especially for narrow-band types) is the need for postfabrica-
tion tuning. Fabrication tolerances and material uncertainties
as well as inaccurate design techniques may all contribute to
the need for tuning. Field theory-based design techniques may
alleviate this problem to some degree.
