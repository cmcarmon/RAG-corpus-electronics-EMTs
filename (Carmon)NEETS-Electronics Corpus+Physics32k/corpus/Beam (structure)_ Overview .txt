Historically beams were squared timbers but are also metal, stone, or combinations of wood and metal such as a flitch beam. Beams can carry vertical gravitational forces but are primarily used to carry horizontal loads (e.g., loads due to an earthquake or wind or in tension to resist rafter thrust as a tie beam or (usually) compression as a collar beam). The loads carried by a beam are transferred to columns, walls, or girders, which then transfer the force to adjacent structural compression members and eventually to ground. In light frame construction, joists may rest on beams.
In carpentry, a beam is called a plate as in a sill plate or wall plate, beam as in a summer beam or dragon beam.
