The decay constant of






Lu




176





{\displaystyle {{\ce {^{176}Lu}}}}
can be obtained through direct counting experiments and by comparing Lu–Hf ages with other isotope system ages of samples whose ages are determined. The commonly accepted decay constant has the value of 1.867 (± 0.007) × 10−11 yr−1. However, there remain discrepancies on the value of decay constant.
