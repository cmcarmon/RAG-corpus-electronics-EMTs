We note that the base current is approximated by the sum of a constant term and a term that is ﬁrst order
in the small variation in base-emitter voltage, vbe. The multiplier of this small voltage is the linearized conduc-
tance, gbe. If we were interested only in small changes in currents and voltages, only this conductance would be
required  in  the  model.  Thus,  the  input  (base-emitter)  circuit  can  be  represented  for  the  small-signal  base
variables, ib and vbe, by either equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.12.
