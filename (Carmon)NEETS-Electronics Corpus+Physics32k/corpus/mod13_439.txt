At CP1, a CLEAR pulse is applied to all the FFs, resetting the register to a count of 0. The number
01012 is applied to the parallel inputs at CP2, causing FF1 and FF3 to set. At this point, the J inputs of
FF2 and FF4 are HIGH. AND gate 2 has a LOW output since the FF4 output is LOW. This LOW output
represents the first digit of the number 01012 to be output in serial form. At the same time we have
HIGHs on the K inputs of FF1 and FF3. (Notice the NOT symbol on FF1 at input K. With no serial input
to AND gate 1, the output is LOW; therefore, the K input to FF1 is held HIGH). With these conditions
CP3 causes FF1 and FF3 to reset and FF2 and FF4 to set. The HIGH output of FF4, along with CP3,
causes AND gate 2 to output a HIGH. This represents the second digit of the number 01012.
