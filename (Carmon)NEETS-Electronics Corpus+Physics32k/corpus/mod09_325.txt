The output frequency can be determined by controlling how long the tank circuit will oscillate. For 
example, suppose a negative input gate of 500 microseconds and a positive input gate of 999,500 
microseconds (total of 1 second) are applied. The transistor will be cut off for 500 microseconds and the 
tank circuit will oscillate for that 500 microseconds, producing an output signal. The transistor will then 
conduct for 999,500 microseconds and the tank circuit will not oscillate during that time period. The 500 
microseconds that the tank circuit is allowed to oscillate will allow only 500 cycles of the 1-megahertz 
tank frequency.
