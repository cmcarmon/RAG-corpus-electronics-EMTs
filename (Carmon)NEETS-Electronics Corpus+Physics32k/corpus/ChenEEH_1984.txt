Cerberus–16 is the ﬁrst synchronous scheme that checks
processors by a reference program (Mahmood and McCluskey,
1988). The WD is implemented by a specialized processor
that has a restricted instruction set. The program executed
by the WD has the same CFG structure as that of the the
program being checked. Each instruction of the WD includes
the number of instructions in the corresponding node, a justi-
fying signature, and the label of the next instruction in the
WD. The reference signature of a path is computed at the end
of a node and the justifying signature is fed to this unit to be
compared to the run-time one. When a branch is executed at the
end of a node, a signal is activated, and the WD takes the same
branch as well; otherwise, the next instruction is executed.
