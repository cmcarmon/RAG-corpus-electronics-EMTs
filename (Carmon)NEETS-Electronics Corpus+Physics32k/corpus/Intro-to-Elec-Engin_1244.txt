13.2.19 A large induction motor is usually started by
applying a reduced voltage across the motor; such
a voltage may be obtained from an autotrans-
former. A motor is to be started on 50% of full-
load torque, and the full-voltage starting current
is 5 times the full-load current. The full-load slip
is 4%. Determine the percentage reduction in the
applied voltage (i.e., the percentage tap on the
autotransformer).
