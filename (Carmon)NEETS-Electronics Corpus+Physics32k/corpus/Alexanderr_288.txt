Equation (6.9) or (6.10) represents the energy stored in the electric ﬁeld
that  exists  between  the  plates  of  the  capacitor.  This  energy  can  be
retrieved, since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. In fact, the
word capacitor is derived from this element’s capacity to store energy
in an electric ﬁeld.
