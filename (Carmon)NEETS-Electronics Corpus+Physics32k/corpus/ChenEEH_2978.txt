Figures of merit for an ampliﬁer depend on a particular
application. Gain and stability are important for all ampliﬁers.
Another ﬁgure of merit is noise ﬁgure (NF), which is of
primary importance for a low-noise ampliﬁer in a typical
ampliﬁer. In a power ampliﬁer, efﬁciency may be of primary
concern if the system has a limited supply of dc power, such as
in satellite transmitters or handheld phones. The ﬁrst topic
of discussion is general ampliﬁer concepts. Issues relevant to
LNA and PA design will be discussed separately.
