The repeaters include the following main elements (see Fig. 74.2): a low noise ampliﬁer (LNA) ampliﬁes the
received signal and establishes the uplink noise. The G/T of the satellite receiver includes the effect of losses in
the satellite antenna, the noise ﬁgure of the LNA, and the noise temperature of the earth seen from space (from
150 to 290 K depending on the percentage of the beam area over oceans and clouds). In a conventional repeater,
the overall frequency band is down-converted by a local oscillator (LO) and mixer from the uplink band to the
downlink  band.  It  is  channelized  by  an  input  multiplexer  into  a  number  (e.g.,  12)  of  transponder  channels.
