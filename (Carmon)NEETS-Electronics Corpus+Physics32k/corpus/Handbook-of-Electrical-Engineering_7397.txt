A  nickel-cadmium  battery  supplies  the  power  to  the  transmitter.  For  the  BCO,  the  resistance  change  of  the
strain  gauge  changes  the  frequency  of  the  subcarrier.  In  the  case  of  the  VCO,  the  millivolt  output  of  the
thermocouple changes the frequency of the subcarrier. This change modulates the radio frequency transmitted
by the antenna. The receiving antenna picks up the signal and conducts it by wire link to the radio receiver,
which is tuned to the transmitting frequency. The radio receiver demodulates the FM carrier to reproduce the
subcarrier signal. The subcarrier signal is then fed to the discriminator, which demodulates this signal to obtain
a dc voltage, which is then ampliﬁed by the dc ampliﬁer and recorded on the oscillograph. The oscillograph
record,  properly  calibrated,  is  then  a  display  of  the  strain  in  microinches  per  inch  for  the  BCOs,  or  the
temperature in degrees for the VCO. At the same time the dc signal can be read on a VTVM and can be used
as a check on the oscillograph.
