• Form a binary tree to the right of the table. A binary tree always has two branches at each node.
Build the tree by merging the two lowest probability symbols at each level, making the probability of
the node equal to the sum of the merged nodes’ probabilities. If more than two nodes/symbols share
the lowest probability at a given level, pick any two; your choice won’t aﬀect B (A).
• At each node, label each of the emanating branches with a binary number. The bit sequence obtained
