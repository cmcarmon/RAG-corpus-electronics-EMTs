Additional Two-Port Parameters and Conversions
We deﬁned the z parameters by establishing I1 and I2 as the independent variables and V1 and V2 as the dependent
variables.  Other  choices  of  independent  and  dependent  variables  lead  to  deﬁnitions  of  alternative  two-port
parameters. The total number of combinations one can make with the four variables, taking two at a time as
independent variables, is six. Table 3.2 deﬁnes the six possibilities as well as the names and symbols given to
the parameters.
