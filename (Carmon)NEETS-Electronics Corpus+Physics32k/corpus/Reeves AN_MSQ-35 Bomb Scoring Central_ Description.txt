The central had a 20 rpm Acquisition Radar System with a variable "fan-shaped beam" in elevation and an Interrogator Set AN/TPX-27 for identification friend or foe. The central's trailer van for operations had the separate AN/MSQ-54 Bomb Scoring Set with an automatic tracking radar group (OA-450/FSA-4 Receiver-Transmitter Control Group), a computer group with analog vacuum tube circuitry and on the roof, the antenna group. A communications group provided a link for receiving the aircraft's signal at simulated bomb release, and additional vehicles included a V-280 maintenance van and a V-287 flatbed trailer for transporting the radar/IFF antennas.
