power supply is often shown using two separate symbols. These symbols 
are a small circle at the end of a line representing one side of the supply, 
with or without a specific voltage label, and the symbol for ground (verti-
cal line with three horizontal lines at the bottom) representing the other 
side of the supply, with a value of 0 volts. In complex circuits with mul-
tiple connections to power, you may see the positive side of the supply 
represented by a rail labeled +V extending across the top of the sche-
matic. These split symbols that represent power supplies are used to 
eliminate a lot of (otherwise confusing) wire connections in a schematic.
