Common-Collector (CC) Conﬁguration
A common-collector (CC) ampliﬁer is also known as an emitter follower (or a voltage follower)
due to the fact that the output voltage “follows” the input by being approximately equal to the
input voltage. The ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 8.3.2(a), in which the collector forms a common
terminal between the input and output circuits, and resistors R1, R2, and RE are determined by
biasing. Capacitors CB and CE are chosen large enough to appear as short circuits at the lowest
frequency of interest in the input signal vS. The output voltage vL is taken across the load resistor
RL. The small-signal ac equivalent circuit of the ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 8.3.2(b), whose
analysis yields the following results:
