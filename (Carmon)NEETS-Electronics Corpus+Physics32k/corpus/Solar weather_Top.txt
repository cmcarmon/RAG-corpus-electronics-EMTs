Solar weather is branch of meteorology, which studies the behavior of the sun and how those behaviors can be predicted. Solar weather research involves developing and running simulations of solar behavior, as well as observing the sun using observation equipment.
Due to the enormous size and mass of the sun, solar weather predictions arenâ€™t as precise as earth-weather predictions.
Solar weather is closely related to space weather and often included in same category.
