Imagine a disk of radius R rotating with constant angular velocity



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
.

The reference frame is fixed to the stationary center of the disk. Then the magnitude of the relative velocity of any point in the circumference of the disk is



ω
R


{\displaystyle \omega R}
. So the circumference will undergo Lorentz contraction by a factor of

c

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {1-(\omega R)^{2}/c^{2}}}}
.
However, since the radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion, it will not undergo any contraction. So

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {circumference} }{\mathrm {diameter} }}={\frac {2\pi R{\sqrt {1-(\omega R)^{2}/c^{2}}}}{2R}}=\pi {\sqrt {1-(\omega R)^{2}/c^{2}}}}
. This is paradoxical, since in accordance with Euclidean geometry, it should be exactly equal to



π


{\displaystyle \pi }
.
