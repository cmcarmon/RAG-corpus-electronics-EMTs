Algorithm 2 (Decomposition of LLS Problem)
Let A 2 Rmn have full column rank. Decompose A into
A ¼ [A1, A2], with A1 2 Rmp and A2 2 Rmq. Let the unique
QR factorization of A1 be A1 ¼ Q1R1. Then the unique solu-
tion x of the LLS problem of equation 6.30 has the form
x ¼ [xT
1 being the unique solutions
of the following LLS problems:
