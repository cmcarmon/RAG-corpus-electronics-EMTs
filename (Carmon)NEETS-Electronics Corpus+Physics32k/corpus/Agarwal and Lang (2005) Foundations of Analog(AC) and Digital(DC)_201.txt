In principle, an electronic circuit can have one or more ports, although in
practice it is common to define only a few ports to simplify matters. For exam-
ple, an amplifier may be described in terms of its input port, its output port,
and one or more ports for connection to power supplies. Even simple network
elements such as sources, resistors, capacitors, and inductors can be thought of
as one-port devices. Voltages are defined across the ports and currents through
the ports as illustrated in Figure 1.36. Observe that the assignment of refer-
ence directions related to v and i follows the associated variables convention
discussed in Section 1.5.2.
