A first-order rational difference equation is a nonlinear difference equation of the form





w

t
+
1


=



a

w

t


+
b


c

w

t


+
d



.


{\displaystyle w_{t+1}={\frac {aw_{t}+b}{cw_{t}+d}}.}

When



a
,
b
,
c
,
d


{\displaystyle a,b,c,d}
and the initial condition




w

0




{\displaystyle w_{0}}
are real numbers, this difference equation is called a Riccati difference equation.
Such an equation can be solved by writing




w

t




{\displaystyle w_{t}}
as a nonlinear transformation of another variable




x

t




{\displaystyle x_{t}}
which itself evolves linearly. Then standard methods can be used to solve the linear difference equation in




x

t




{\displaystyle x_{t}}
.
