increases as the height of the scatter volume is increased; (2) the amount of turbulence decreases with 
height. As the distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas is increased, the height of the 
scatter volume must also be increased. The received signal level, therefore, decreases as circuit distance is 
increased.
