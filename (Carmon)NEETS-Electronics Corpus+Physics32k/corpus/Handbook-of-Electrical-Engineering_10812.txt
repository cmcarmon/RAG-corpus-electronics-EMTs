The second group of DFE activities can be thought of as “speciﬁc DFE”. Here, DFE is considered as a module
of  existing  product  realization  processes,  speciﬁcally  the  “Design  for  X”,  or  DFX,  systems  used  by  many
electronics manufacturers. The method involves creation of software tools and checklists, similar to those used
in  Design  for  Manufacturability,  Design  for  Testability,  or  Design  for  Safety  modules  that  ensure  relevant
environmental considerations are also included in the design process from the beginning. The challenge is to
create modules which, in keeping with industrial ecology theory, are broad, comprehensive, and systems-based,
yet can be deﬁned well enough to be integrated into current design activities.
