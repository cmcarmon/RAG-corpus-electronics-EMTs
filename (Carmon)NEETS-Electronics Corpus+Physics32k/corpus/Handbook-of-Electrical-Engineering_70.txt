The  dielectric  constant  of  a  material  determines  the  electrostatic
energy which may be stored in that material per unit volume for a given
voltage.  The  value  of  the  dielectric  constant  expresses  the  ratio  of  a
capacitor in a vacuum to one using a given dielectric. The dielectric of
air is 1, the reference unit employed for expressing the dielectric constant.
As the dielectric constant is increased or decreased, the capacitance will
increase or decrease, respectively. Table 1.4 lists the dielectric constants
of various materials.
