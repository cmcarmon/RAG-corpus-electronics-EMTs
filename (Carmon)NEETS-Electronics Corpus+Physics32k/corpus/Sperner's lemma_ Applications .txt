Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of fixed points. A Sperner coloring can be constructed such that fully labeled simplices correspond to fixed points of a given function. By making a triangulation smaller and smaller, one can show that the limit of the fully labeled simplices is exactly the fixed point. Hence, the technique provides a way to approximate fixed points.
For this reason, Sperner's lemma can also be used in root-finding algorithms and fair division algorithms; see Simmonsâ€“Su protocols.
Sperner's lemma is one of the key ingredients of the proof of Monsky's theorem, that a square cannot be cut into an odd number of equal-area triangles.
Fifty years after first publishing it, Sperner presented a survey on the development, influence and applications of his combinatorial lemma.
