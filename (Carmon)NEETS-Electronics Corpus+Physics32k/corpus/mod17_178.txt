Point-to-Point.â€”Most point-to-point, long-haul circuits between naval communications stations
quickly use up the available frequency spectrum that ssb provides. Independent sideband (isb)
transmission is normally used to compensate for the deficiency. Isb is used extensively in naval
communications to expand our traffic capabilities. You will find there is a similarity between ssb and isb.
Isb uses outputs from two sideband generators; it suppresses both carriers and then filters out an upper
sideband from one and a lower sideband from the other. We then combine the two remaining sidebands
and transmit an envelope with upper and lower sidebands that contain different intelligence. Isb can be
used with MULTIPLEXING (a method for simultaneous transmission of two or more signals over a
common carrier wave) to transmit a lot of intelligence on one circuit. Independent sideband and
multiplexing will be discussed in more detail in chapter 3.
