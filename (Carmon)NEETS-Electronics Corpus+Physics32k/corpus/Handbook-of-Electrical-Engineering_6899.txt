noise power E[We (t)2] = 4kTeRdf yields the extra “input” noise power. Let V(t) = W(t) + We (t). Then PVV (df ) =
4kToRdf + 4kTeRdf = 4k(To + Te)Rdf W, from Eq. (73.24). Te is called the equivalent input noise temperature. It
is related to the noise factor F by Te = 290(F – 1). In cascaded ampliﬁers with gains G1, G2 , . . . and equivalent
input noise temperatures Te1, Te2 , . . ., the total equivalent input noise temperature is
