THE AMPERE is the basic unit used to indicate an electric current. A current of one ampere is said
to flow when one coulomb of charge (6.28 x 1018 electrons) passes a given point in one second of time.
Current measurements may be expressed in the following units: ampere (A), milliampere (mA), and
microampere ( $���&XUUHQW�LQ�D�FLUFXLW�LQFUHDVHV�LQ�GLUHFW�SURSRUWLRQ�WR�WKH�YROWDJH��emf) applied across
the circuit.
