What we need to solve every circuit problem are mathematical statements that express how the circuit
elements are interconnected. Said another way, we need the laws that govern the electrical connection of
circuit elements. First of all, the places where circuit elements attach to each other are called nodes.
Two nodes are explicitly indicated in Figure 3.6; a third is at the bottom where the voltage source and
resistor R2 are connected. Electrical engineers tend to draw circuit diagrams—schematics— in a rectilinear
fashion. Thus the long line connecting the bottom of the voltage source with the bottom of the resistor
is intended to make the diagram look pretty. This line simply means that the two elements are connected
together. Kirchhoﬀ’s Laws, one for voltage and one for current, determine what a connection among
circuit elements means. These laws can help us analyze this circuit.
3.4.1 Kirchhoﬀ’s Current Law
At every node, the sum of all currents entering a node must equal zero. What this law means physically is
that charge cannot accumulate in a node; what goes in must come out. In our example circuit depicted in
Figure 3.6, we have a three-node circuit and thus have three KCL equations.
