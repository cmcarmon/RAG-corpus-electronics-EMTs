Remember that a current source is a component whose job is to provide a constant amount
of current, outputting as much or as little voltage necessary to maintain that constant current.
As with Thevenin’s Theorem, everything in the original circuit except the load resistance
has been reduced to an equivalent circuit that is simpler to analyze. Also similar to Thevenin’s
Theorem are the steps used in Norton’s Theorem to calculate the Norton source current (IN orton)
and Norton resistance (RN orton).
