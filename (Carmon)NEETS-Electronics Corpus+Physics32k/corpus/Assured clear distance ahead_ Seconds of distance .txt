Drivers and law enforcement alike can apply elementary level arithmetic towards a rule of thumb to estimate minimal stopping distance in terms of how many seconds of travel ahead at their current speed. For speed "v" in miles per hour, this rule of thumb is as follows:






t
â‰ˆ


v
20


+
1


(Seconds of distance to stop rule)





{\displaystyle \color {Sepia}{t\approx {\frac {v}{20}}+1\quad {\text{(Seconds of distance to stop rule)}}}}


If this distance is greater than the ACDA, they need to slow down. While most experienced drivers develop a broad intuition required by everyday braking, this rule of thumb can still benefit some to recalibrate expectations for rare hard braking, particularly from high speeds. Additional simple corrections can be made to compensate for the environment and driving ability. Read more about the Seconds of Distance to Stop Rule.
