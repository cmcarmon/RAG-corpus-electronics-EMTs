Figure 1.2: On the left is the classic Lena image, which is used ubiquitously as a test image. It contains
straight and curved lines, complicated texture, and a face. On the right is a perspective display of the
Lena image as a signal: a function of two spatial variables. The colors merely help show what signal
values are about the same size. In this image, signal values range between 0 and 255; why is that?
