In the United States, steering columns are governed by several federal regulatory requirements, notably FMVSS 108, 114 and 208. The Chinese directive GB15740- 2006 obligates Chinese car manufacturers to incorporate anti-theft mechanisms in their vehicles. European Union Commission Directive 95/56/EC (1995) mandates all cars exported to European markets must be fitted with anti-theft security devices. This regulation also requires that a steering lock must be able to withstand forces of 100Nm applied to the steering wheel without failing.
