Conclusion
The diverse product variety of the electronics industry offers numerous opportunities to curtail the environ-
mental  impact  of  the  industry.  These  opportunities  are  multidimensional.  Services  made  possible  through
telecommunications technology enable people to work from home reducing emissions that would be generated
by traveling to work. Smaller, faster computers and the Internet require less material usage, reducing the energy
demand  during  processing  and  waste  generated  during  fabrication. All  these  represent  examples  of  how  the
electronics industry provides enablers of sustainability.
