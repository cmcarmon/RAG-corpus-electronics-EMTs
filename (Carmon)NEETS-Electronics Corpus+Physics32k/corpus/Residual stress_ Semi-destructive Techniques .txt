Similarly to the destructive techniques, these also function using the "strain release" principle. However, they remove only a small amount of material, leaving the overall integrity of the structure intact. These include:
Deep Hole Drilling – measures the residual stresses through the thickness of a component by relaxing the stresses in a "core" surrounding a small diameter drilled hole.

Centre Hole Drilling – measures the near-surface residual stresses by strain release corresponding to a small shallow drilled hole with a strain gauge rosette. Centre hole drilling is appropriate for up to 4 mm in depth. Alternatively, blind hole drilling can be used for thin parts. Center hole drilling can also be performed in the field for on-site testing.
Ring Core – similar to Centre Hole Drilling, but with greater penetration, and with the cutting taking place around the strain gauge rosette rather than through its centre.
