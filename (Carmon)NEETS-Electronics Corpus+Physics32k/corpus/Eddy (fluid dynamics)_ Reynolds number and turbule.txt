In 1883, scientist Osborne Reynolds conducted a fluid dynamics experiment involving water and dye, where he adjusted the velocities of the fluids and observed the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, characterized by the formation of eddies and vortices. Turbulent flow is defined as the flow in which the system's inertial forces are dominant over the viscous forces. This phenomenon is described by Reynolds number, a unit-less number used to determine when turbulent flow will occur. Conceptually, the Reynolds number is the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces.

The transition from laminar to turbulent flow in a fluid is defined by the critical Reynolds number:

{\displaystyle Re_{c}\approx 2000}

In terms of the critical Reynolds number, the critical velocity is represented as:
