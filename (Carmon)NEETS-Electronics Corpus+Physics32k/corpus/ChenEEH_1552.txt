During the development of MYCIN, the importance of
separating a knowledge base and an inference engine was recog-
nized. Shortly afterwards, EMYCIN (Buchanan and Shortliffe,
1984),
the domain-independent version of MYCIN, was
produced by removing speciﬁc domain knowledge about in-
fectious blood disease. It became the forerunner of expert
system shells. The impact of EMYCIN was immediate in the
development of subsequent expert systems. For example, PUFF
(Aikens et al., 1983), a program for analyzing pulmonary prob-
lems, was developed based on EMYCIN in about 5 years, a
signiﬁcant improvement over the 20 years required to develop
MYCIN.
