The time required for tr recovery is determined by the time taken by the tr switch (tube) to deionize 
after each transmitter pulse. It is usually defined as the time required for the receiver to return to within 6 
dB of normal sensitivity after the end of the transmitter pulse. However, some manufacturers use the time 
required for the sensitivity to return to within 3 dB of normal sensitivity. Tr recovery time is a factor that 
limits the minimum range of a radar because the radar receiver is unable to receive until the tr switch is 
deionized. In various radars, the recovery time may differ from less than 1 microsecond to about 20 
microseconds.
