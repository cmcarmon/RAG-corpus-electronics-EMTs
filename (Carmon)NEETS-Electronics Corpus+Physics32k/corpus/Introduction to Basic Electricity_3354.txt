Because a TRIAC can control current flowing in 
 either direction, it is widely used to control application 
of AC power to various types of loads. It can be turned 
on by applying a gate current and turned off by reduc-
ing the operating current to below the holding level. 
It is designed to conduct forward and reverse current 
through the terminals.
