Similarly,  we  can  obtain  mesh-current  equations  by  inspection
when  a  linear  resistive  circuit  has  only  independent  voltage  sources.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17, shown again in Fig. 3.26(b) for con-
venience. The  circuit  has  two  nonreference  nodes  and  the  node  equa-
tions were derived in Section 3.4 as
