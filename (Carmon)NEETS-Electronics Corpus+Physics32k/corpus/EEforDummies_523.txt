Isolating circuits from a power source
If the number of turns of wire in the primary winding 
of a transformer is the same as the number of turns in 
the secondary winding, theoretically, all of the volt-
age across the primary will be induced across the secondary. This is known 
as a 1:1 transformer, because there is a 1:1 (read “one‐to‐one”) relationship 
between the two coils. (In reality, no transformer is perfect, or lossless, and 
some of the electrical energy gets lost in the translation.)
