experienced not only in one subcircuit or block of the chip
but throughout the entire design. Because of this, designers are
often willing to sacriÔ¨Åce increased physical capacitance or
circuit activity for reduced voltage. Unfortunately, a speed
penalty is paid for supply voltage reduction, with delays dras-
tically increasing as Vdd approaches the threshold voltage Vt
of the devices. This tends to limit the useful range of Vdd to a
minimum of about 2 to 3 Vt (Pedram, 1995; Chandraksan et
al., 1992). Effectively, speed optimization techniques are ap-
plied and then the supply voltage is scaled which bring the
design back to its original timing but with a lower power
requirement Benini et al., 2001.
