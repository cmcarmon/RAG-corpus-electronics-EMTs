generally is an astable multivibrator. The multivibrator is either ASYMMETRICAL or SYMMETRICAL.
If the multivibrator is asymmetrical, it generates rectangular waves. If the multivibrator is symmetrical, it
generates square waves. In either case, the timing trigger pulses are equally spaced after a limiter removes
undesired positive or negative lobes.
