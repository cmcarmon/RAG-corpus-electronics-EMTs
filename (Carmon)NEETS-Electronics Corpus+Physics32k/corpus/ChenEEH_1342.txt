The cache coherent nonuniform memory access (CC-NUMA)
paradigm, as employed in the Sequent NUMA-Q (Lovett and
Clapp, 1996), for example, is a relatively recent idea compared
to SMP. CC-NUMA systems strike a balance between the
tightly coupled SMP systems and more loosely coupled clusters
of communicating computers. The idea behind CC-NUMA
systems is that while all processors have access to all portions
of the main memory, the memory access time is allowed to
vary depending on the part of main memory that is being
