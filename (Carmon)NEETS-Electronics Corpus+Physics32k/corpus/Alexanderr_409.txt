First—as always in circuit analysis—we must carefully handle the
across the capacitor and the direction of the cur-
polarity of voltage 
through  the  inductor.  Keep  in  mind  that  v and  i are  deﬁned
rent 
strictly according to the passive sign convention (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.23).
One  should  carefully  observe  how  these  are  deﬁned  and  apply  them
accordingly.
