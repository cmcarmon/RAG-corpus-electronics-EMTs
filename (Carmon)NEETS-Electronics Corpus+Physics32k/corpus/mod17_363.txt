The Navy uses two basic radio teletypewriter (ratt) systems. These are the TONE-MODULATED 
SYSTEM, referred to as audio-frequency tone shift (afts), and the CARRIER-FREQUENCY SHIFT 
SYSTEM, referred to as radio-frequency-carrier shift (rfcs). The rfcs system is also called frequency-shift 
keying (fsk).
