Other processing applications for robot use include spray coating and various machining or cutting opera-
tions.  Spray  coating  is  a  major  application  in  the  automotive  industry  where  robots  have  proven  suitable  in
overcoming various hazards such as fumes, mist, nozzle noise, ﬁre, and possible carcinogenic ingredients. The
advantages of robotic spray coating are lower energy consumption, improved consistency of ﬁnish, and reduced
paint quantities used. To install a robotic painting application, one needs to consider certain manual require-
ments. These include continuous-path control to emulate the motion of a human operator, a hydraulic drive
system to minimize electrical spark hazards, and manual lead-through programming with multiple program
storage  capability  [Groover,  et al.,  1986].  Newer  schemes  have  considered  geometric  modeling,  painting
mechanics, and robot dynamics to output an optimal trajectory based on CAD data describing the objects [Suh
et al.,  1991].  The  objective  of  such  work  is  to  plan  an  optimal  robot  trajectory  that  gives  uniform  coating
thickness and minimizes coating time.
