Many power plants generate AC by rotating conductive coils inside a strong 
horseshoe‚Äêshaped magnet. The coils are attached to a rotating turbine, which 
turns as water or steam applies pressure to its fins. As the coils make one full 
rotation inside the magnet, the magnet pulls electrons first in one direction 
and then in the other direction, producing alternating current.
