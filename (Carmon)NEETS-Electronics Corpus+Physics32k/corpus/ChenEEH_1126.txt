Most MEMS sensors involve moving elements. However,
detectors with no moving parts for sensing optical, infrared,
and microwave signals are also made by micromachining. We
will review important newly developed infrared sensor arrays
before turning to the more familiar and already commercially
successful micromechanical MEMS sensors.
