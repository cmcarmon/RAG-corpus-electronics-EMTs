diode reverse biased. The resistor allows a small cur-
rent to flow to keep the zener diode in its zener 
 breakdown region. The input voltage must be higher 
than the  zener breakdown voltage of the diode. The 
voltage across the zener diode is equal to the zener 
diode’s voltage rating. The voltage dropped across the 
 resistor is equal to the difference between the zener 
 diode’s voltage and the input voltage.
