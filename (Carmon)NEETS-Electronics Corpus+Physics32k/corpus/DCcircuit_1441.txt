This may be analogously understood by considering capacitive and inductive energy storage
in mechanical terms. Capacitors, storing energy electrostatically, are reservoirs of potential
energy. Inductors, storing energy electromagnetically (electrodynamically), are reservoirs of
kinetic energy. In mechanical terms, potential energy can be illustrated by a suspended mass,
