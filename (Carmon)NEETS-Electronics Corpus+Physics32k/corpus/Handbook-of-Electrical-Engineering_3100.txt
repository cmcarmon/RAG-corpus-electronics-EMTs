The  Ô¨Ålter  in  Fig.  29.30(a)  contains  an  inductor.  This  inductor  can  be  implemented  as  a  simulated  inductor.
Since neither node of the inductor is grounded, it is necessary to use the current conveyor simulated inductor.
The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 29.30(b). The inductance of the simulated inductor is given by Eq. (29.29).
Substituting this equation into Eq. (29.30) gives the transfer function of the circuit in Fig. 29.30(b)
