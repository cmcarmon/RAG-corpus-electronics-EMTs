The Earth's plates are slowly moving in different directions, except at plate boundaries, where energy builds up in any rock mass that overlays them. Thus, if a road is built straight across the fault as in Time 1 of the figure panel, it is perpendicular to the fault trace at point E, where the fault is locked. The overall plate movement (large arrows) causes the rocks across the locked fault to accrue elastic deformation, as in Time 2. This deformation may build at the rate of a few centimeters per year. When the accumulated strain is great enough to overcome the strength of the rocks, the result is a sudden break, or a springing back to the original shape as much as possible, a jolt which is felt on the surface as an earthquake. This sudden movement results in the shift of the roadway's surface, as shown in Time 3. The stored energy is released partly as heat, partly in alteration of the rock, and partly as a seismic wave.
