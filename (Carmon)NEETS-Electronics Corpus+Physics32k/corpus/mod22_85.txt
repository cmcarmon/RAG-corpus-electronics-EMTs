A further breakthrough came with the development of word-processing application programs for 
microcomputers. These programs cost a fraction of their office machine counterparts, and could be run on 
general-purpose microcomputers. This was unique because general-purpose microcomputers could be 
used for functions such as spreadsheets, data base management systems, and programming in common 
computer languages.
