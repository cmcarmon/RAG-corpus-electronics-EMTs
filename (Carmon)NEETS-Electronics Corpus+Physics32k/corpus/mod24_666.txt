LDs are also much more temperature sensitive than either SLEDs or ELEDs. Increases in the laser
temperature significantly reduce laser output power. Increases in laser temperature beyond certain limits
result in the loss of lasing. When lasers are used in many applications, the temperature of the laser must
be controlled. Typically, electronic coolers, called thermo-electric (TE) coolers, are used to cool LDs in
system applications.
