Programmer
The programmer provides a bi-directional wireless link to the implanted pacemaker through a telemetry wand.
The  physician  can  program  parameters  that  customize  functions,  check  battery  capacity,  send  functional
commands  to  the  pacemaker,  check  for  past  events,  and  monitor  realtime  or  stored  electrograms  measured
from the implanted electrodes. Diagnostics provide an invaluable tool for the physician to assess patient welfare,
and a well-designed programmer will effectively display this information. Because of the overwhelming avail-
ability of parameters and functions built into modern pacemakers, the programmer is an essential part of the
pacemaker system. The major problem associated with current telemetry systems is the speed of data transfer.
Transfer speeds will need to be signiÔ¨Åcantly increased in the future to keep pace with the increasing number
of available diagnostics.
