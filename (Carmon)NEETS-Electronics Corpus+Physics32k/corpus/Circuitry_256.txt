Current gain 
 
The  current  gain  offered  by  a  transistor  is  a 
measure  of  its  effectiveness  as  an  amplifying 
device.  The  most  commonly  quoted  parameter  is 
that  which  relates  to  common-emitter  mode. In 
this  mode,  the  input  current  is  applied  to  the  base 
and the output current appears in the collector (the 
emitter is effectively common to both the input and 
output circuits). 
  The common-emitter current gain is given by:
