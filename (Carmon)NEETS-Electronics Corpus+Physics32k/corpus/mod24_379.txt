A fiber optic splice is a permanent fiber joint whose purpose is to establish an optical connection
between two individual optical fibers. System design may require that fiber connections have specific
optical properties (low loss) that are met only by fiber-splicing. Fiber optic splices also permit repair of
optical fibers damaged during installation, accident, or stress. System designers generally require fiber
splicing whenever repeated connection or disconnection is unnecessary or unwanted.
