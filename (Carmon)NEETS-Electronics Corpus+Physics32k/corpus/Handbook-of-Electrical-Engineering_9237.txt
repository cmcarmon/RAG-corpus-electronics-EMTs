 is often used to deﬁne a very rigorous form of manual analysis [Fagan, 1976]. Ideally,
the inspection team will have received formal training before participating in their ﬁrst inspection. Also, the
inspection team will follow formal protocols in terms of preparation, execution, recording of defects encoun-
tered,  and  follow-up  of  the  inspection  session.  The  normal  complement  for  a  formal  inspection  includes  a
moderator,  a  recorder,  a  reader  to  paraphrase  the  material  being  inspected,  the  developer  whose  work  is
undergoing inspection, and often one or more additional inspectors.
