In phase modulation (pm) the intelligence is contained in the amount and rate of phase shift in a
carrier wave. You should recall from your study of pm that there is an incidental shift in frequency as the
phase of the carrier is shifted. Because of this incidental frequency shift, fm demodulators, such as the
Foster-Seeley discriminator and the ratio detector, can also be used to demodulate phase-shift signals.
