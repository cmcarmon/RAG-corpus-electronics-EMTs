When current flows through a wire, it generates a 
magnetic field around the wire (Figure 18-7). This 
can be shown by placing a compass next to a wire 
that has no current flowing through it. The compass 
aligns itself with the earthâ€™s magnetic field. When cur-
rent passes through the wire, however, the compass 
needle is deflected and aligns itself with the magnetic 
field generated by the current. The north pole of the 
compass indicates the direction of the flux lines. The 
 direction of the flux lines can also be determined if 
the direction of the current flow is known, using 
the left-hand	rule	for	conductors. If the wire is 
grasped with the left hand, with the thumb pointing 
in the direction of current flow, the fingers point in 
the direction of the flux lines (Figure 18-8). When the 
polarity of the voltage source is reversed, the flux lines 
are also reversed.
