In figure 2-42A, two materials are brought together to form a pn-junction diode. The different energy 
levels in the two materials cause a diffusion of the holes and electrons through both materials which tends 
to balance their energy levels. When this diffusion process stops, the diode is left with a small area on 
either side of the junction, called the depletion area, which contains no free electrons or holes. The 
movement of electrons through the materials creates an electric field across the depletion area that is 
described as a barrier potential and has the electrical characteristics of a charged capacitor.
