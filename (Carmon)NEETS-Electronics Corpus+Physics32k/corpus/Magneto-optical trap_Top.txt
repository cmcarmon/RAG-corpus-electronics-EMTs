A magneto-optical trap (abbreviated MOT) is an apparatus that uses laser cooling with magneto-optical trapping in order to produce samples of cold, trapped, neutral atoms at temperatures as low as several microkelvins, two or three times the recoil limit (see Doppler cooling limit). By combining the small momentum of a single photon with a velocity and spatially dependent absorption cross section and a large number of absorption-spontaneous emission cycles, atoms with initial velocities of hundreds of metres per second can be slowed to tens of centimetres per second.
Although charged particles can be trapped using a Penning trap or a Paul trap using a combination of electric and magnetic fields, those traps do not work for neutral atoms.
