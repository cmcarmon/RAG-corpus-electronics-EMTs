connected to the supply voltage and two nMOS transistors in
series connected to ground (Johnson, 1989). If the source and
drain of one of the pMOS transistors is shorted, then it always
conducts irrespective of its gate voltage; the output of the
NAND gate is always connected to the supply voltage and
thus always at logic 1. Thus, this fault can be modeled by the
NAND gate output being stuck-at-1.
