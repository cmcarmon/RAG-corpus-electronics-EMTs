Like resistors, inductors in parallel combine by adding the reciprocals of 
each individual inductance, and then taking the reciprocal of that sum. (You 
may remember from math class that the reciprocal is the multiplicative 
inverse of a number, or the number that you multiply by so that the result 
equals 1. So for any integer x, 1/x is its reciprocal.)
