, the hermitian conjugate of the displacement operator can also be interpreted as a displacement of opposite magnitude (

The product of two displacement operators is another displacement operator, apart from a phase factor, has the total displacement as the sum of the two individual displacements. This can be seen by utilizing the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula.

{\displaystyle e^{\alpha {\hat {a}}^{\dagger }-\alpha ^{*}{\hat {a}}}e^{\beta {\hat {a}}^{\dagger }-\beta ^{*}{\hat {a}}}=e^{(\alpha +\beta ){\hat {a}}^{\dagger }-(\beta ^{*}+\alpha ^{*}){\hat {a}}}e^{(\alpha \beta ^{*}-\alpha ^{*}\beta )/2}.}

{\displaystyle e^{(\alpha \beta ^{*}-\alpha ^{*}\beta )/2}}
