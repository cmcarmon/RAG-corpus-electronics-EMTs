speech system. Tube models and their differential equations of
wave propagation proved to be remarkably useful tools in
understanding the speech production system. Although the
prevailing DT ‘‘all-pole’’ model of speech production was not
derived directly from the acoustic tube theory, important in-
sights and interpretations of the DT model have been obtained
from classical theory (Deller, 2000; Rabiner and Schafer, 1978).
A general linear, time-invariant DT model for speech produc-
tion is shown in the block-diagram form in Figure 3.4. The model
is a terminal analog, and it is understood to represent only short
intervals of speech over which signal dynamics are assumed to be
stationary. Frequent updating or adaptation of model param-
eters is necessary to properly model the quickly time-varying
nature of speech. With this caveat, such a system produces
reasonable quality speech for coding and synthesis purposes
and serves as a useful analysis model for recognition and related
tasks, in spite of the fact that there are no provisions for coupling
or nonlinear effects among subsystems in the model.
