Moving coil meters are designed to measure DC 
current. To measure AC current on this meter, the AC 
current must first be converted to DC current. This is 
accomplished with diodes called rectifiers. The pro-
cess of converting AC to DC is called rectification. 
The rectifiers are placed between the meter input and
