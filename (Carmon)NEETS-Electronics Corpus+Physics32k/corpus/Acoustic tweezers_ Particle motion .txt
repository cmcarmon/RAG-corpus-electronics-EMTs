The motion of a suspended particle whose gravity is balanced by the buoyance force in an acoustic field is determined by two forces: the acoustic radiation force and Stokes drag force. By applying the Newton’s law, the motion can be described as:

.

where
•





v




{\displaystyle {\textit {v}}}
is the fluid velocity,
•





u




{\displaystyle {\textit {u}}}
is the velocity of particle.
For applications in a static flow, the fluid velocity comes from the acoustic streaming. The magnitude of acoustic streaming depends on the power and frequency of input. Also, the properties of fluid media affect the value as well. For typical acoustic-based microdevices, the operating frequency ranges from ~kHz to ~MHz. The vibration amplitude is in range of 0.1 nm~1 µm. The fluid used is water. The estimated magnitude of acoustic streaming is in range of 1 µm/s~ 1 mm/s. Thus, the acoustic streaming should be smaller than the main flow for most continuous flow applications. The drag force is mainly induced by the main flow in those applications.
