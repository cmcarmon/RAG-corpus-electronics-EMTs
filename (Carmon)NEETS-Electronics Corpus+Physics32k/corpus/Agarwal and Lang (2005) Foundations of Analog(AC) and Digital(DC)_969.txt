We make one final observation about our amplifier. Although vB is an
amplified version of the input signal vA when the input signal is boosted with
a DC offset, vB is not linearly related to vA. Notice from Equation 7.14
that our amplifier is nonlinear even when the MOSFET operates in the
saturation region. Fortunately, the MOSFET amplifier behaves as an approxi-
mately linear amplifier for small signals; in other words, when the desired input
signal vA is very small. However, we will postpone a more detailed analysis of
