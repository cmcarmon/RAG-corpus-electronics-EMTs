Unlike vacuum tubes, transistors are very rugged in that they can tolerate vibration and a rather large
degree of shock. Under normal operating conditions, they will provide dependable operation for a long
period of time. However, transistors are subject to failure when they are subjected to relatively minor
overloads. Crystal detectors are also subject to failure or deterioration when subjected to electrical
overloads and will deteriorate from a long period of normal use. To determine the condition of
semiconductors, you can use various test methods. In many cases you may substitute a transistor of
known good quality for a questionable one to determine the condition of a suspected transistor. This
method is highly accurate and sometimes efficient. However, you should avoid indiscriminate
substitution of semiconductors in critical circuits. When transistors are soldered into equipment,
substitution becomes impractical - generally, you should test these transistors while they are in their
circuits.
