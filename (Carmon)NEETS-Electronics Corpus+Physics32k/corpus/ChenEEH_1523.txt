next 3 bits apply to other members of the owner’s group (e.g.,
department or project). The last 3 bits pertain to everyone else;
these 3 bits control reading, writing, and executing the ﬁle,
respectively. Thus a mode of 640 (octal) means that the owner
can read and write the ﬁle, other members of the owner’s
group can read it, and outsiders have no access at all. A
mode of 777 (octal) allows everyone to do everything to the
ﬁle. On the screen, these two example modes are displayed as
rw-r----- and rwxrwxrw, respectively.
