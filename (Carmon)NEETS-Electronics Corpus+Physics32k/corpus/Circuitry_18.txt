Unit of electric 
current (a current of 1 
A flows when a charge 
of 1 C is transported in 
a time interval of 1 s) 
Unit of electric charge 
or quantity of 
electricity 
Unit of capacitance 
(a capacitor has a 
capacitance of 1 F 
when a potential of 1 V 
across its plates 
produced a charge of  
1 C)  
Unit of inductance 
(an inductor has an 
inductance of 1 H 
when an applied 
current changing at  
1 A/s produces a 
potential difference of 
1 V across its 
terminals) 
Unit of frequency 
(a signal has a 
frequency of 1 Hz if 
one cycle occurs in an 
interval of 1 s) 
Unit of energy 
Unit of resistance 
Unit of time 
Unit of conductance 
(the reciprocal of 
resistance) 
Unit of magnetic flux 
density (a flux density 
of 1 T is produced 
when a flux of 1 Wb is 
present over an area of  
1 square metre) 
Unit of electric 
potential (e.m.f. or 
p.d.) 
Unit of power 
(equivalent to 1 J of 
energy consumed in  
1 s) 
Unit of magnetic flux
