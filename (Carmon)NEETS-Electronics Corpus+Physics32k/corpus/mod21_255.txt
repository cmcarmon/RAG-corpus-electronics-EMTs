NICADs are also subject to a phenomenon commonly referred to as cell memory. If a NICAD is
consistently discharged to a minor extent (for example, 30 minutes per day) and then recharged after each
use, the useful capacity of the cell will eventually be reduced to that level. To keep this from happening,
you should fully discharge (1.1 volts) NICADs on a regular basis. In fact, some maintenance requirement
cards and calibration laboratory procedures require this periodic full discharge of equipment containing
NICADs.
