Cycloconverter Induction Motor Drive
A phase-controlled cycloconverter can be used for speed control of an ac machine (induction or synchronous
type).  Figure 30.48  shows  a  drive  using  a  three-pulse  half-wave  or  18-thyristor  cycloconverter.  Each  output
phase group consists of positive and negative converter components which permit bidirectional current ﬂow.
The ﬁring angle of each converter is sinusoidally modulated to generate the variable-frequency, variable-voltage
output required for ac machine drive. Speed reversal and regenerative mode operation are easy. The cyclocon-
verter  can  be  operated  in  blocking  or  circulating  current  mode.  In  blocking  mode,  the  positive  or  negative
converter is enabled, depending on the polarity of the load current. In circulating current mode, the converter
components  are  always  enabled  to  permit  circulating  current  through  them.  The  circulating  current  reactor
between the positive and negative converter prevents short circuits due to ripple voltage. The circulating current
mode gives simple control and a higher range of output frequency with lower harmonic distortion.
