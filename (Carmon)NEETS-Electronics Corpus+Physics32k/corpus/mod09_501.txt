A SQUARE WAVE is identified by, two alternations equal in time that are square in appearance. 
One alternation is called a PULSE. The time for one complete cycle is called the PULSE REPETITION 
TIME (prt). The number of times in one second that the cycle repeats itself is called PULSE 
REPETITION RATE (prr) or PULSE REPETITION FREQUENCY (prf). The length of the pulse 
measured in the figure (T0 to T1) is referred to as the PULSE WIDTH (pw). The left side of the pulse is 
referred to as the LEADING EDGE and the right side as the TRAILING EDGE.
