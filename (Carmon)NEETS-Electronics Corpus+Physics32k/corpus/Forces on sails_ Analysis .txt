Sail design differs from wing design in several respects, especially since on a sail air flow varies with wind and boat motion and sails are usually deformable airfoils, sometimes with a mast for a leading edge. Often simplifying assumptions are employed when making design calculations, including: a flat travel surfaceâ€”water, ice or land, constant wind velocity and unchanging sail adjustment.
The analysis of the forces on sails takes into account the aerodynamic surface force, its centre of effort on a sail, its direction, and its variable distribution over the sail. Modern analysis employs fluid mechanics and aerodynamics airflow calculations for sail design and manufacture, using aeroelasticity models, which combine computational fluid dynamics and structural analysis. Secondary effects pertaining to turbulence and separation of the boundary layer are secondary factors. Computational limitations persist. Theoretical results require empirical confirmation with wind tunnel tests on scale models and full scale testing of sails. Velocity prediction programs combine elements of hydrodynamic forces (mainly drag) and aerodynamic forces (lift and drag) to predict sailboat performance at various windspeed for all points of sail
