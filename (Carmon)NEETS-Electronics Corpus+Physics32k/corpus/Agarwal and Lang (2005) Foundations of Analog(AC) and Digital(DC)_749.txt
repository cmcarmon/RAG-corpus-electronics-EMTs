ment the logic expression Output = AB + C + D using gates. Notice that we have a
choice in implementing this expression. We can use one two-input AND gate, a three-
input OR gate, and an inverter as shown in Figure 5.18. We can also replace the OR
gate-inverter pair with a NOR gate. Alternatively, by rewriting the expression as
