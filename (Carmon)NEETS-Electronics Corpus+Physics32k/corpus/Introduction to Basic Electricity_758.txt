Printed circuit board (PCB) design process requires 
specific component models as well as autorouting for 
the traces. autorouting is a technique for saving time 
and money when designing a PCB. Historically, auto-
routing is faster than manual routing, but the percep-
tion is that the results are not always satisfactory or do 
not look the same as manual routing.
