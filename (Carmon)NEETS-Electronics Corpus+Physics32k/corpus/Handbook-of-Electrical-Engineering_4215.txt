Transmitter
The transmitter function is to amplify waveforms to a power level sufﬁcient for target detection and estimation.
There is a general trend away from tube-based transmitters toward solid-state transmitters. In particular, solid-
state transmit/receive modules appear attractive for constructing phased array radar systems. In this case, each
radiating element is driven by a module that contains a solid-state transmitter, phase shifter, low-noise ampliﬁer,
and associated control components. Active arrays built from such modules appear to offer signiﬁcant reliability
advantages over radar systems driven from a single transmitter. However, microwave tube technology continues
to  offer  substantial  advantages  in  power  output  over  solid-state  technology.  Transmitter  technologies  are
summarized in Table 41.2.
