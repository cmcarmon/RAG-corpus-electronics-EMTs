PLANEWAVES.—The mode theory suggests that a light wave can be represented as a plane wave.
A plane wave is described by its direction, amplitude, and wavelength of propagation. A plane wave is a
wave whose surfaces of constant phase are infinite parallel planes normal to the direction of propagation.
The planes having the same phase are called the wavefronts. The wavelength (ÿ) of the plane wave is
given by:
