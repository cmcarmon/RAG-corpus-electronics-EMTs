The receiver you will study here is fundamentally the same as those we covered in chapter 2. A 
receiver used in this frequency range is about the same electrically as one used in any other range. Figure 
5-5 shows the receiver we will discuss. It is a highly sensitive, special purpose receiver because it is 
capable of splitting-out multiplex signals for detection and reproduction. This receiver covers the 
frequency range of 3 kilohertz to 810 kilohertz in five bands. It will receive most types of signals, 
including AM, cw, ssb, fm, and fsk. All operator controls are on the front panel, and a speaker and 
headset jack permit monitoring.
