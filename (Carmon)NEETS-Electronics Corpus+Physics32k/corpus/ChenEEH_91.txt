e2, e3, e4, e5, e6 is a circuit. In the directed graph of Figure
2.3(B) P: e1, e2, e7, e5 is a directed path and C: e1, e2, e7, e6
is a directed circuit. Note that C: e7, e5, e4, e1, e2
is a
circuit in this directed graph, although it is not a directed
circuit. Similarly, P: e9, e6, e3 is a path but not a directed
path.
