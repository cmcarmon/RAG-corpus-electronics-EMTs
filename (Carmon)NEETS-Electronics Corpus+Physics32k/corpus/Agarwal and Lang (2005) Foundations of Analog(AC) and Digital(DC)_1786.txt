Let us first consider the case where S1 is opened and S2 is kept closed for a long period
of time. At the instant that S1 is opened and S2 is closed, the inductor has a current
equal to V/R flowing through it. Since the current flowing through the inductor cannot
change instantaneously, the same current will flow into the capacitor through the closed
switch S2. As the capacitor charges, its voltage rises and the current decreases. After
some amount of time, the current reaches zero. If the capacitor is small enough, or
if there was a large enough initial voltage on it, its voltage might be at a higher value
than the voltage of the source V. Let us assume this is the case. Because the capacitor
voltage reaches a higher value than V, it begins to supply energy and a current begins to
flow through the inductor in the reverse direction. This process continues as the energy
oscillates between the inductor and the capacitor. If the given switch settings exist for
a long enough period of time, the oscillations will die out as the resistor dissipates the
energy.
