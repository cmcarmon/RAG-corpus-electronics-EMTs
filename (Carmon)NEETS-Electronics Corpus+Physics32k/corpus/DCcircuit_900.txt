The measurement electrode’s purpose is to generate the voltage used to measure the solu-
tion’s pH. This voltage appears across the thickness of the glass, placing the silver wire on one
side of the voltage and the liquid solution on the other. The reference electrode’s purpose is to
provide the stable, zero-voltage connection to the liquid solution so that a complete circuit can
be made to measure the glass electrode’s voltage. While the reference electrode’s connection
to the test liquid may only be a few kilo-ohms, the glass electrode’s resistance may range from
ten to nine hundred mega-ohms, depending on electrode design! Being that any current in this
circuit must travel through both electrodes’ resistances (and the resistance presented by the
test liquid itself), these resistances are in series with each other and therefore add to make an
even greater total.
