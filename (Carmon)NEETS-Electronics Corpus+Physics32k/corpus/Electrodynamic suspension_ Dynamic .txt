This form of maglev can cause the levitated object to be subject to a drag induced oscillation, and this oscillation always occurs at a sufficiently high speed. These oscillations can be quite serious and can cause the suspension to fail.
However, inherent system level damping can frequently avoid this from occurring, particularly on large scale systems.
Alternatively, addition of lightweight tuned mass dampers can prevent oscillations from being problematic.
Electronic stabilization can also be employed.
