are performing a nodal analysis on a circuit containing a current-controlled current source. For purposes of
counting  independent  nodes,  the  controlled  current  source  is  treated  as  an  open  circuit. After  equations  are
written  for  the  unknown  node  voltages,  the  current  source  will  introduce  into  at  least  one  equation  its
controlling  current,  which  is  not  one  of  the  nodal  variables.  The  additional  step  required  by  the  controlled
source is that of expressing the controlling current in terms of the nodal variables.
