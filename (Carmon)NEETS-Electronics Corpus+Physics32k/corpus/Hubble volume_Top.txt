In cosmology, a Hubble volume or Hubble sphere is a spherical region of the observable universe surrounding an observer beyond which objects recede from that observer at a rate greater than the speed of light due to the expansion of the Universe. The Hubble volume is approximately equal to 1031 cubic light years.
The proper radius of a Hubble sphere (known as the Hubble radius or the Hubble length) is

{\displaystyle c/H_{0}}
, where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light and




H

{\displaystyle H_{0}}
is the Hubble constant. The surface of a Hubble sphere is called the microphysical horizon, the Hubble surface, or the Hubble limit.
More generally, the term "Hubble volume" can be applied to any region of space with a volume of order

. However, the term is also frequently (but mistakenly) used as a synonym for the observable universe; the latter is larger than the Hubble volume.
