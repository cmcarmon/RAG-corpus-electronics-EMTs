Functional  and  declarative  languages  employ  higher  levels  of  abstraction  by  restricting  the  world  view  to
simple mechanisms: mathematical functions and constraints. It may seem odd that such restrictions increase
the level of abstraction, but languages like LISP and PROLOG hide much of the detail found to be necessary
in the procedural paradigm. This increases the measure of level deÔ¨Åned in this section.
