In 1988 the BVC Medal and Prize was first awarded for distinguished contributions to British scientific research in the fields of vacuum science, surface science, thin films or any related topic in which vacuum science and engineering play an important role. It was presented to Prof R H Williams at the 1st European Vacuum Conference held at Salford in April 1988, immediately before the Annual Address. It was also felt that the presenter of the Annual Address should also receive a medal. Consequently, the John Yarwood Medal was instituted for this purpose and was first presented in 1989 to Prof C T Campbell. The John Yarwood Memorial Medal has been established to honour the memory of Professor John Yarwood - a prominent scientist in the field of vacuum physics and one of the founders of the British Vacuum Council.
Currently the British Vacuum Council awards the Senior Prize, which is associated with the John Yarwood Memorial Medal. The prize is awarded for distinguished contributions to British scientific research in the fields of vacuum science, surface science, thin films or any related topic in which vacuum science and engineering play an important role. Prize winners may be invited to deliver the BVC Annual Address at an appropriate occasion.
