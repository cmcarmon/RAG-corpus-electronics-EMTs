The first method of damping comes from the d’Arsonval meter movement itself. In the d’Arsonval
meter movement, current through the coil causes the coil to move in the magnetic field of the permanent
magnet. This movement of the coil (conductor) through a magnetic field causes a current to be induced in
the coil opposite to the current that caused the movement of the coil. This induced current will act to
damp oscillations. In addition to this method of damping, which comes from the movement itself, most
meters use a second method of damping.
