Austrian philosopher Alexius Meinong (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects. Starting with the “principle of intentionality”, mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object. People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist. Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.
