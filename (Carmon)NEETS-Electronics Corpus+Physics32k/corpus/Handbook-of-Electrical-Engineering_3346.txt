Integrated Optics
Integrated optics can be deﬁned as the monolithic integration of one or more optical guided-wave structures
on a common substrate. These structures can be passive, such as a ﬁxed optical power splitter, or active, such
as  an  optical  switch. Active  devices  are  realized  by  placing  metal  electrodes  in  close  proximity  to  the  optical
waveguides.  Applying  a  voltage  to  the  electrodes  changes  the  velocity  of  the  light  within  the  waveguide.
Depending on the waveguide geometry and the electrode placement, a wide variety of technologically useful
devices and circuits can be realized.
