The most common parasitic inductance is the inductance associated with a
wiring loop. In the lumped circuit abstraction, this inductance is ignored unless
it is explicitly modeled in a circuit using an additional lumped inductor. To
estimate the inductance of a wiring loop, consider the circular loop of wire in
free space shown in Figure 9.26. The loop has a loop radius R and a wire radius
A. Its inductance L is given approximately by2
