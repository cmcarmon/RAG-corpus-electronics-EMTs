Various codes, such as the National Electrical Code, have been established to provide
protection of personnel and property, while specifying requirements for the installation and
maintenance of electrical systems. Only qualiﬁed and properly certiﬁed persons should undertake
installation, alteration, or repair of electrical systems. Safety when working with electric power
must always be a primary consideration. In addition to numerous deaths caused each year due
to electrical accidents, ﬁre damage that results from improper use of electric wiring and wiring
faults amounts to millions of dollars per year.
