Greater accuracy may be obtained by replacing the ammeter with a standard resistor, used
as a current-measuring shunt. There will still be compound error between the standard resis-
tor and the voltmeter used to measure voltage drop, but this will be less than with a voltmeter
+ ammeter arrangement because typical standard resistor accuracy far exceeds typical amme-
ter accuracy. Using Kelvin clips to make connection with the subject resistance, the circuit
looks something like this:
