A ribbon cable consists of optical fiber ribbons stranded down the center of the cable surrounded by
a protective tube, strength members, and an outer jacket. The fiber optic ribbon consists of multiple-
coated, 250 Âµ m diameter fibers sandwiched in a plastic material. Figure 3-17 shows a cross-sectional
view of a 12-fiber ribbon. Cable manufacturers stack these ribbons to form a rectangular cross-sectional
array of fibers. Stacked ribbons are the basic building blocks of the ribbon cable. Figure 3-18 illustrates
this cross-sectional array of ribbons. Manufacturers introduce a controlled twist to the stacked ribbons to
minimize fiber stress when the cable is bent. An inner plastic tube, strength members, and an outer
protective jacket surround the stacked ribbons, providing environmental protection.
