If the machine is brought up to a speed of ωm = ωs − ωr, an average unidirec-
tional torque is established, and continuous energy conversion takes place at the
asynchronous speed of ωm. Again, note that the machine is not self-starting, since
an average unidirectional torque is not developed at ωm = 0 with the speciﬁed
electrical excitations.
