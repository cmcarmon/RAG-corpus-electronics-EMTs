Figure 2-4 shows the arrangement of grids in a conventional pentode. The small circles depict cross
sections of the grids. Notice that each grid is offset, or staggered, from the grid directly behind it. This
arrangement of grids permits each grid to be exposed to the electron stream flowing from cathode to plate.
