Ignoring all factors other than the gravitational force between the body and the object, an object projected vertically at speed

{\displaystyle v}
from the surface of a spherical body with escape velocity

satisfying the equation

Unlike escape velocity, the direction (vertically up) is important to achieve maximum height.
