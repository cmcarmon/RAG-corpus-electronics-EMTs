AC adapters supply currents ranging from hundreds of milliamps to a few 
amps at voltages ranging from 5 volts DC to 20 volts DC. Some provide both a 
positive DC voltage and a negative DC voltage. Different models use different 
types of connectors to deliver power. If you purchase an AC adapter, be sure 
to read the specification sheet (specs) carefully to determine its power rating 
and how to connect it to your circuit.
