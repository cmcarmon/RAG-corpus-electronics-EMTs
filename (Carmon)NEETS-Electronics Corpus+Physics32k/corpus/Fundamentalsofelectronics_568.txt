We usually draw discrete-time signals as stem plots to emphasize the fact they are functions deﬁned only on
the integers. We can delay a discrete-time signal by an integer just as with analog ones. A signal delayed
by m samples has the expression s (n − m).
5.5.2 Complex Exponentials
The most important signal is, of course, the complex exponential sequence.
