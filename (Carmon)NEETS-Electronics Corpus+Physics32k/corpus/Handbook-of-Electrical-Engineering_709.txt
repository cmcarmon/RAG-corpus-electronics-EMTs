Applications to Integrodifferential Equations
If we transform both members of a linear differential equation with constant coefÔ¨Åcients, the result will be an
algebraic equation in the transform of the unknown variable. This follows from Eq. (6.6), which also shows
that the initial conditions are automatically taken into account. The transformed equation may then be solved
for the transform of the unknown and inverted to obtain the time-domain answer.
