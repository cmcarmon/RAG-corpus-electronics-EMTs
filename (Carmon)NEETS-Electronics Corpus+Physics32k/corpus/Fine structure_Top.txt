In atomic physics, the fine structure describes the splitting of the spectral lines of atoms due to electron spin and relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic Schr√∂dinger equation. It was first measured precisely for the hydrogen atom by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887 laying the basis for the theoretical treatment by Arnold Sommerfeld, introducing the fine-structure constant.
