The bifilar dial was invented in April 1922 by the mathematician and maths teacher, Hugo Michnik, from Beuthen, Upper Silesia. He studied the horizontal dial- starting on a conventional XYZ cartesian framework and building up a general projection which he states was an exceptional case of a Steiner transformation. He related the trace of the sun to conic sections and the angle on the dial-plate to the hour angle and the calculation of local apparent time, using conventional hours and the historic Italian and Babylonian hours.  He refers in the paper, to a previous publication on the theory of sundials in 1914.
His method has been applied to vertical near-declinant dials, and a more general declining-reclining dial.
Work has been subsequently done by Dominique Collin.
