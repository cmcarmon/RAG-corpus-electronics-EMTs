. Audio equipment can be easily connected to a computer
system through an interface such as a sound card. Popular
audio equipment is MIDI keyboard. MIDI stands for
musical instrument digital interface. It stores the infor-
mation of how the music should be played back instead of
all the information about the music, with the help of a
wave table in a sound card. Since MIDI skips the storage
of actual sound itself, it saves a lot of memory space.
However, MIDI might not be accurate without a good
wavetable. A wavetable with 32 voices means that the
sound card stores 32 voices in its ROM, and MIDI can
just call the voices without recording the voices again.
