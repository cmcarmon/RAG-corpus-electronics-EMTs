A typical plot of p(t) is shown in Figure 3.1.2, revealing that it is the sum of an average component,
V rmsIrms cos φ, which is a constant that is time independent, and a sinusoidal component, VrmsIrms
cos(2ωt + φ), which oscillates at a frequency double that of the original source frequency and has
zero average value. The average component represents the electric power delivered to the circuit,
whereas the sinusoidal component reveals that the energy is stored over one part of the period
and released over another, thereby denoting no net delivery of electric energy. It can be seen that
the power p(t) is pulsating in time and its time-average value P is given by
