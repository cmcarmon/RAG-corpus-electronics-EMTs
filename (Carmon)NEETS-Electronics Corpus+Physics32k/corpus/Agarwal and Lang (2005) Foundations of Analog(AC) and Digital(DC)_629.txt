We will discuss incremental analysis using the diode as an example.
Suppose we wish to determine the value of the diode current iD in the cir-
cuit in Figure 4.37. Here we have a diode and a pair of voltage sources as in
many previous examples, but in this case one source, VI, is fixed at a value of,
say, 0.7 V, and the other, vI, is a 1-mV sinusoid. Inputs of this form a DC
value plus a small time-varying component
occur frequently in practice, and
so it is important to find a simple way to solve for the circuit response for this
type of input. We could, of course, take the obvious analytical approach and
write
