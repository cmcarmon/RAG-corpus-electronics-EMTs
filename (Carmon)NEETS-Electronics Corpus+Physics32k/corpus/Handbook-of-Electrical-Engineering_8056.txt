manufacturing  typically  have  Ô¨Åve  or  six  joints.  Current  practice  is  to  treat  each  joint  in  the  robot  arm  as  a
separate servomechanism with its own control system. For example, the PUMA 560 robot arm, manufactured
by Unimation, has six rotating joints. Each joint is controlled by an individual microcontroller system. Another
computer calculates paths and sends individual joint motion information to the six joint servomechanisms [Fu
et al., 1987].
