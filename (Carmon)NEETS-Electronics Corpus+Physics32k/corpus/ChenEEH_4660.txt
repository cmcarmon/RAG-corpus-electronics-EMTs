In this section, we describe an extension of an idea that Ô¨Årst
appeared in Fiagbedzi and Pearson (1986, 1987) for transform-
ing delayed systems. Dividing the unstable poles of the delayed
system with a given stability margin into N sets, where each set
contains n unstable poles, N characteristic matrices can be
found that inherit the nN unstable poles. A linear transfor-
mation can then be applied to convert the original delayed
system to a delay-free system with the state matrix being the
direct sum of the N characteristic matrices. The novelty of the
approach described here is in showing that SMC can then be
designed based on the delay-free system, and asymptotic sta-
bility can be shown for both delay-free and delayed systems
on certain sliding surfaces. The reaching condition is proved in
the case of bounded and matched external disturbance, and
the sliding surface is chosen by the means of a Lyapunov
function. It should be noted that the sliding surface is a
function of previous system states and controls and has intui-
tive appeal for time-delay systems.
