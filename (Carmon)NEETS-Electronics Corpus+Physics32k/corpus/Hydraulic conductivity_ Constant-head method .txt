The constant-head method is typically used on granular soil. This procedure allows water to move through the soil under a steady state head condition while the quantity (volume) of water flowing through the soil specimen is measured over a period of time. By knowing the quantity



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
of water measured, length



L


{\displaystyle L}
of specimen, cross-sectional area



A


{\displaystyle A}
of the specimen, time



t


{\displaystyle t}
required for the quantity of water



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
to be discharged, and head



h


{\displaystyle h}
, the hydraulic conductivity can be calculated:

t


=
A
v



{\displaystyle {\frac {Q}{t}}=Av\,}

where



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the flow velocity. Using Darcy's Law:




v
=
K
i



{\displaystyle v=Ki\,}

and expressing the hydraulic gradient



i


{\displaystyle i}
as:




i
=


h
L




{\displaystyle i={\frac {h}{L}}}

where



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the difference of hydraulic head over distance



L


{\displaystyle L}
, yields:

L




{\displaystyle {\frac {Q}{t}}={\frac {AKh}{L}}}

Solving for

gives:
