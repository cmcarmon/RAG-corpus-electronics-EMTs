The integrated circuit (IC) was invented in 1958 (see the sidebar, “The birth 
of the IC”) to solve the problems inherent in manually assembling mass quan-
tities of tiny transistors. Also called chips, integrated circuits are miniaturized 
circuits produced on a single piece of semiconductor. A typical integrated 
circuit contains hundreds of transistors, resistors, diodes, and capacitors; 
the most advanced ICs contain several billion components. Because of this 
circuit efficiency, you can build complex circuits with just a few parts. ICs are 
the building blocks of larger circuits. You string them together to form just 
about any electronic device you can think up.
