Emulation
, veriﬁes a design by realizing the design in “preproduction”
Emulation, also called 
  hardware  means  nonoptimized  hardware
hardware  and  exercising  the  hardware.  The  term 
providing  the  correct  functional  behavior,  but  not  necessarily  the  correct  performance.  That  is,  emulation
hardware may be slower, require more area, or dissipate more power than production hardware. At present,
programmable logic devices
 
(PLDs), typically ﬁeld-
preproduction hardware commonly involves some form of 
(FPGAs). PLDs provide generic combinational and sequential digital system logic
programmable 
that can be programmed to realize a wide variety of designs [Walters, 1991].
