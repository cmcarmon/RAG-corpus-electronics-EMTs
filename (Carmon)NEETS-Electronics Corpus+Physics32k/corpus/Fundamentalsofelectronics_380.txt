Another feature of a signal is its average power. A signal’s instantaneous power is deﬁned to be its
square. The average power is the average of the instantaneous power over some time interval. For a periodic
signal, the natural time interval is clearly its period; for non-periodic signals, a better choice would be entire
time or time from onset. For a periodic signal, the average power is the square of its root-mean-squared
(rms) value. We deﬁne the rms value of a periodic signal to be
