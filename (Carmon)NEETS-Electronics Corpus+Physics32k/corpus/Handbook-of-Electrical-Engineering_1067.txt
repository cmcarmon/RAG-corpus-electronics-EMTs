The  spectrum  S(e jw¢)  is  periodic  in  w¢  with  period  2p.  The  fundamental  period  in  the  range  –p  <  w¢  £  p,
sometimes  referred  to  as  the  baseband,  is  the  useful  frequency  range  of  the  DT  system  because  frequency
components in this range can be represented unambiguously in sampled form (without aliasing error). In much
of the signal-processing literature the explicit primed notation is omitted from the frequency variable. However,
the  explicit  primed  notation  will  be  used  throughout  this  section  because  there  is  a  potential  for  confusion
when so many related Fourier concepts are discussed within the same framework.
