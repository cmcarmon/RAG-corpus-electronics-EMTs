The heterodyning process can be analyzed by using SPECTRUM ANALYSIS (the display of 
electromagnetic energy arranged according to wavelength or frequency). As shown in figure 1-18, 
spectrum analysis is an effective way of viewing the energy in electronic circuits. It clearly shows the 
relationships between the two fundamental frequencies (10 and 11 hertz) and their sum (21 hertz) and 
difference (1 hertz) frequencies. It also allows you to view the BANDWIDTH (the amount of the 
frequency spectrum that signals occupy) of the signal you are studying.
