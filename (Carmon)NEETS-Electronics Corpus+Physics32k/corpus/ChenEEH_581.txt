Several unit cells of the kind shown in Figure 7.11 are con-
nected in parallel to achieve the desired current rating. The
cells are connected in a variety of geometrical layouts, such as
stripes, squares, and hexagonal shapes. The source n√æ region
and p-body region are shorted. This creates a parasitic diode
connected from the drain to the source of the MOSFET. This
integral diode is useful in several power electronics applica-
tions, such as half-bridge and full-bridge PWM converters.
