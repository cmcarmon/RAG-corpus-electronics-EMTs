is the channel conductance without depletion under the
Schottky gate. The variable VP in equation 3.55 is called the
pinch-off voltage, which is the net potential across the gate
junction when the depletion region width under the gate is
exactly equal to the channel depth, a. The pinch-off voltage is
given by:5
