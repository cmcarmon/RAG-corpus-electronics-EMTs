The voltage-controlled oscillator is typically the most critical circuit in determining the overall noise per-
formance of a PLL. For this reason it is often implemented using discrete components, especially at the higher
frequencies. Some digital integrated circuits exist for lower-frequency VCOs, and microwave integrated circuit
VCOs  are  now  available  for  use  to  several  gigahertz.  The  major  design  parameters  for  a  VCO  include  the
operating frequency, tuning range, tuning linearity, and phase noise performance. Further information on the
design of VCOs is contained in the references.
