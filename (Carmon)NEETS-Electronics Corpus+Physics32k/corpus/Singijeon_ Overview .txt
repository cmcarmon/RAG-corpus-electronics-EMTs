Singijeon were divided among three major types: large, medium, and small. The 52 cm long rocket was launched individually on a handheld gun, and the launch was initiated by a fuse in the tube. Even after launch, the fuse would remain in the tube, consuming the black powder until it hit the "warhead" and caused detonation. The fuse length was determined by the amount of gunpowder in the paper tube, and was adjusted depending on the distance that the missile had to cover so that it would explode on the target. Its range was around 1 to 2 kilometers. The medium singijeon was of the same construction and function as the large singijeon, but, due to its smaller size of 13 cm, its range was limited to 150 meters. However, its explosive warhead was still powerful enough to make a 30 cm-deep crater in a patch of sand. The small singijeon was simply an arrow with a gunpowder pouch attached to it, and had no explosive capabilities. It was launched in multiples of 100 by a hwacha, and had a range of 100 meters. All gunpowder weapons including the singijeon used black powder.
