Three forces have to be overcome when conveying with high density solids pumps:
The conveying distance (cf. Record held by Concrete pump)
Friction between material and pipeline, especially in bends and reduction joints.
Inner frictional force caused by deformation of the material.
Calculation example:
Conveyance suspension
Delivery line of 200 mm (8 in) diameter (DN200)
High-density solids with mineral or carbon content as a mixture from coarse and fine grained material.
Maximum particle size 50 mm (1.969 in)
Dry solids content up to 80 percent by weight
Energy consumption = approx. 50 Wh (180 kJ) per tonne of conveyed material and per kilometer (280 Btu per long ton or 250 Btu per short ton per mile).
