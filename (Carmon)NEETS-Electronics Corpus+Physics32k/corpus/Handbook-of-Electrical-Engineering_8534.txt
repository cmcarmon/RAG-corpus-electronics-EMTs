Memory unit: The unit responsible for storing programs and data. There are two main types of units: primary
memory, consisting of millions of bit storage cells fabricated from electronic semiconductor integrated
circuits, used to hold programs and data during program execution; and secondary memory, based on
magnetic disks, diskettes, and tapes, used to store permanent copies of programs and data.
