Records can be placed on tape either separately as single records (unblocked) as shown in figure 
2-15, view A, or multiple records can be grouped together (blocked) as shown in figure 2-15, view B, to 
form a record block. The number of records stored in a record block is the blocking factor. In this 
example, the blocking factor is five.
