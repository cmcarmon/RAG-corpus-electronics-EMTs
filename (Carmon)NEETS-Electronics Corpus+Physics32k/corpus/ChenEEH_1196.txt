Dual Threshold Technique
Dual threshold technique (Kao and Chandrakasan, 2000) is
used to reduce leakage power by assigning high threshold
voltage to some transistors in noncritical paths and using low
threshold transistors in critical paths. To achieve the best
leakage power savings under target performance constraints,
an algorithm is presented for selecting and assigning an opti-
mal high threshold voltage. Results show that dual threshold
technique is good for power reduction.
