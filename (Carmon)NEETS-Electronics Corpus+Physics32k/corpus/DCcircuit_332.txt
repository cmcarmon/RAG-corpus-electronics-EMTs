If you see someone lying unconscious or ”froze on the circuit,” the very ﬁrst thing to do is
shut off the power by opening the appropriate disconnect switch or circuit breaker. If someone
touches another person being shocked, there may be enough voltage dropped across the body
of the victim to shock the would-be rescuer, thereby ”freezing” two people instead of one. Don’t
be a hero. Electrons don’t respect heroism. Make sure the situation is safe for you to step into,
or else you will be the next victim, and nobody will beneﬁt from your efforts.
