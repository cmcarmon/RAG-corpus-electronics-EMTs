Being that the motivation for electrons to move through a cell is chemical in nature, the
amount of voltage (electromotive force) generated by any cell will be speciﬁc to the particular
chemical reaction for that cell type. For instance, the lead-acid cell just described has a nominal
voltage of 2.04 volts per cell, based on a fully ”charged” cell (acid concentration strong) in good
physical condition. There are other types of cells with different speciﬁc voltage outputs. The
Edison cell, for example, with a positive electrode made of nickel oxide, a negative electrode
made of iron, and an electrolyte solution of potassium hydroxide (a caustic, not acid, substance)
generates a nominal voltage of only 1.2 volts, due to the speciﬁc differences in chemical reaction
with those electrode and electrolyte substances.
