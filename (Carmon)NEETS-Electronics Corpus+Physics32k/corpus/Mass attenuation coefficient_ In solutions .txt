In chemistry, mass attenuation coefficients are often used for a chemical species dissolved in a solution. In that case, the mass attenuation coefficient is defined by the same equation, except that the "density" is the density of only that one chemical species, and the "attenuation" is the attenuation due to only that one chemical species. The actual attenuation coefficient is computed by

{\displaystyle \mu =(\mu /\rho _{1})\rho _{1}+(\mu /\rho _{2})\rho _{2}+\ldots ,}

where each term in the sum is the mass attenuation coefficient and density of a different component of the solution (the solvent must also be included). This is a convenient concept because the mass attenuation coefficient of a species is approximately independent of its concentration (as long as certain assumptions are fulfilled).
A closely related concept is molar absorptivity. They are quantitatively related by
(mass attenuation coefficient) × (molar mass) = (molar absorptivity).
