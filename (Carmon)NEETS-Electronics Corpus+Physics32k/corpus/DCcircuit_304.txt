The path current takes through the human body makes a difference as to how harmful it is.
Current will affect whatever muscles are in its path, and since the heart and lung (diaphragm)
muscles are probably the most critical to oneâ€™s survival, shock paths traversing the chest are
the most dangerous. This makes the hand-to-hand shock current path a very likely mode of
injury and fatality.
