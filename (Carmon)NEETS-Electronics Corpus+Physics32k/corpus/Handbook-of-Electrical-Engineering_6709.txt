Another recent innovation is the ATM, usually associated with B-ISDN. The idea of ATM is to partition a
user’s data into many small segments, called cells, for transmission over the network. Independent of the data’s
origin, the cell size is 53 octets, of which 5 octets are for use by the network itself for routing and error control.
Users  of  the  ATM  are  responsible  for  segmentation  and  reassembly  of  their  data.  Any  control  information
required for this purpose must be included in the 48 octets of user information in each cell. In the usual case,
these  cells  would  be  transmitted  over  networks  that  would  provide  users  with  135  Mb/s  and  above  data
transmission capacity (with user overhead included in the capacity).
