Say, for instance, that the secondary consists of 200 turns of wire — twice as 
many as the primary, which consists of 100 turns of wire. If you apply an AC 
voltage with a peak value of 50 V to the primary, the peak voltage induced 
across the secondary will be 100 V, or twice the value of the peak voltage 
across the primary. This type of transformer is known as a step‐up trans-
former, because it steps up the voltage from the primary to the  secondary.
