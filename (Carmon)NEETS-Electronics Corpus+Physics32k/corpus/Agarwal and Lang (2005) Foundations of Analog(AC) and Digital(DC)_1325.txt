This response can also be obtained directly by substituting Equation 9.90 into Equation
9.66, and then making use of Equation 9.82. At first glance it might not appear that
LI◦δ(t) has the units of voltage, but it does because LI◦ has the units of flux linkage, and
δ(t) has the units of reciprocal time. In fact, LI◦ is the total flux linkage delivered by the
impulse voltage.
