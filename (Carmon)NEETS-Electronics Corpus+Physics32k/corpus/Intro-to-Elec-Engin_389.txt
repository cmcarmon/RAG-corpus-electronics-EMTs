In analog systems, a signal voltage or current is made proportional to some physical quantity.
Since voltages (or currents) can take on any values over a continuous range between some
minimum and some maximum, analog systems are also known as continuous-state systems.
These are to be distinguished from digital or discrete-state systems, in which only certain values
of voltage (or current) are allowed.
