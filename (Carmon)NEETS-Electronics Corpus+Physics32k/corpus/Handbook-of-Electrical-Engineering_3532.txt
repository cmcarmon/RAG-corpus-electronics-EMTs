Register  transfer  synthesis  takes  as  input  the  results  of  algorithmic  synthesis  and  addresses  “per-cycle”
behavior, which means the behavior during one clock cycle. Register transfer synthesis selects logic to realize
the hardware computational units generated during algorithmic synthesis, such as realizing an addition oper-
ation with a carry–save adder or realizing addition and subtraction operations with an arithmetic logic unit.
