Sound has three basic characteristics: pitch, intensity, and quality. Each of these three characteristics
is associated with one of the properties of the source or the type of waves which it produces. The pitch
depends upon the frequency of the waves; the intensity depends upon the amplitude of the waves; and the
quality depends upon the form of the waves. With the proper combination of these characteristics, the
tone is pleasant to the ear. With the wrong combination, the sound quality turns into noise.
