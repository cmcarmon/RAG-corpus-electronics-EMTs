The primary system leaving the substation is most often
in the 11,000 to 15,000-V range. A speciÔ¨Åc voltage used is
12,470-V line-to-line and 7,200-V line-to-neutral (conven-
tionally written 12,470Y/7,200 V). Some utilities still use a
lower voltage, such as 4,160Y/2,400 V. In recent years, however,
the use of primary distribution circuits in the 25- and 35-kV
classes is increasing; all of these circuits are four-wire sys-
tems. Single-phase loads are connected line-to-neutral on the
four-wire systems. Congested and heavy-load locations in
metropolitan areas as well as new residential areas are custom-
arily served by underground primary feeders made up of ra-
dial three-conductor cables.
