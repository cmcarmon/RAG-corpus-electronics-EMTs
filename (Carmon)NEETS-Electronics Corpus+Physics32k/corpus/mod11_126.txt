The attenuator is a widely used piece of test equipment that can be used to demonstrate the 
importance of the decibel as a unit of measurement. Attenuators are used to reduce a signal to a smaller 
level for use or measurement. Most attenuators are rated by the number of decibels the signal is reduced. 
The technician's job is to know the relationship between the dB rating and the power reduction it 
represents. This is so important, in fact, that every student of electronics should memorize the 
relationships in table 2-1 through the 60 dB range. The technician will have to apply this knowledge to 
prevent damage to valuable equipment. A helpful hint is to note that the first digit of the source level (on 
the chart) is the same number as the corresponding power of 10 exponent; i.e., 40 dB = 1 Ã— 104 or 10,000. 
A 20 dB attenuator, for example, will reduce an input signal by a factor of 100. In other words, a 100-
milliwatt signal will be reduced to 1 milliwatt. A 30 dB attenuator will reduce the same 100-milliwatt 
signal by a factor of 1,000 and produce an output of 0.1 milliwatt. When an attenuator of the required size 
is not available, attenuators of several smaller sizes may be added directly together to reach the desired 
amount of attenuation. A 10 dB attenuator and a 20 dB attenuator add directly to equal 30 dB of 
attenuation. The same relationship exists with amplifier stages as well. If an amplifier has two stages rated 
at 10 dB each, the total amplifier gain will be 20 dB.
