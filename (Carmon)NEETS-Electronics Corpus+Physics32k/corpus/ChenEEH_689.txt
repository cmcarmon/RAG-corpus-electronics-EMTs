The end result is a very low-power SRAM component (e.g.,
5 mW for 1 M SRAM operating at 10 MHz for a 1-V 0.5-mm
CMOS technology [Morimura and Shibata, 1996], and 10 mW
for 1-M SRAM operating at 100 MHz for a longer term future
0.5-V 0.35-mm CMOS technology [Yamauchi et al., 1996].
Combined with the advance in process technology, all this
has also led to a remarkable reduction of the DRAM-related
power: from several watts for the 16â€“32-Mb generation to
about 100 mW for 100-MHz operation in a 256-Mb DRAM.
