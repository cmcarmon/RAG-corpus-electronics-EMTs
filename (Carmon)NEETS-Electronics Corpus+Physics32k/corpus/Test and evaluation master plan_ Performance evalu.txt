Measures of effectiveness are specific metrics that are used to measure results in the overall mission and execution of assigned tasks.
These may have flexible performance limits associated with the outcome of a specific event. For example, the first round fired from a gun aimed using a radar would not impact a specific location, but the position can be measured using the radar, so the system should be able to deliver a round within a specific radius after several rounds have been fired. The number of rounds required to land one inside the limit is the MOE. The radius would be a Measure Of Performance (MOP).
Measures of performance are specific metrics that have a pass or fail limit that must be satisfied. These are generally identified with the words shall or must in the specification.
One type of MOP is the distance that a vehicle with a specific load must travel at a specific speed before running out of fuel.
Another type of MOP is the distance that a radar can detect a 1 square meter reflector.
Measures of suitability evaluate the ability to be supported in its intended operational environment.
As an example, this may be an evaluation of the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) that is evaluated during other testing. A system with excessive failures may satisfy all other requirements and not be suitable for use. A gun that jams when dirty is not suitable for military use.
These requirements are associated with ilities.
