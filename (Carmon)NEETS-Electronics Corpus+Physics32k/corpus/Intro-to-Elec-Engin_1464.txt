From the viewpoint of ease of implementation, the simplest receiver structure is that of
conventional AM. Standard AM, VSB, and FM are widely used for AM, television, and high-
ﬁdelity FM broadcasting. The relative power inefﬁciency of the AM transmitter is compensated
for by the extremely simple structure of several billions of receivers. The receiver structure
is much more complicated for DSB SC and SSB SC systems, since they require synchronous
demodulation. These systems, therefore, are never used for broadcasting purposes. Note that
DSB SC also suffers from its relative bandwidth inefﬁciency.
