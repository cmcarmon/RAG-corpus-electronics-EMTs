Generally, op-amps are designed to be powered 
by a dual-voltage power supply in the range of 65 
to 615 volts. The positive power source delivers 15 
to 115 volts with respect to ground. The negative 
power source delivers 25 to 215 volts with respect to 
ground. This allows the output voltage to swing from 
positive to negative with respect to ground. However, 
in certain cases, op-amps may be operated from a sin-
gle voltage source.
