The inside of the large end of a CRT is coated with a fluorescent material that gives off light when
struck by electrons. This coating is necessary because the electron beam itself is invisible. The material
used to convert the electronsâ€™ energy into visible light is a PHOSPHOR. Many different types of
phosphor materials are used to provide different colored displays and displays that have different lengths
of PERSISTENCE (duration of display).
