Ratings
Most  fuses  have  three  electrical  ratings:  ampere  rating,  voltage  rating,  and  interrupting rating.  The  ampere
rating indicates the current the fuse can carry without melting or exceeding speciﬁc temperature rise limits.
The voltage rating, ac or dc, usually indicates the maximum system voltage that can be applied to the fuse. The
interrupting rating (I.R.) deﬁnes the maximum short-circuit current that a fuse can safely interrupt. If a fault
current higher than the interrupting rating causes the fuse to operate, the high internal pressure may cause the
fuse to rupture. It is imperative, therefore, to install a fuse, or any other type of protective device, that has an
interrupting  rating  not  less  than  the  available  short-circuit  current.  A  violent  explosion  may  occur  if  the
interrupting rating of any protective device is inadequate.
