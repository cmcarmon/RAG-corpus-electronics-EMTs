Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise in a quantum field theory with both spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking. These two types of symmetry breaking typically occur separately, and at different energy scales, and are not thought to be predicated on each other.
In the absence of explicit breaking, spontaneous symmetry breaking would engender massless Nambu–Goldstone bosons for the exact spontaneously broken chiral symmetries. The chiral symmetries discussed, however, are only approximate symmetries, given their small explicit breaking.
The explicit symmetry breaking occurs at a smaller energy scale. The properties of these pseudo-Goldstone bosons can normally be calculated using chiral perturbation theory, expanding around the exactly symmetric theory in terms of the explicit symmetry-breaking parameters. In particular, the computed mass must be small, mπ ≈ √vmq / fπ .
