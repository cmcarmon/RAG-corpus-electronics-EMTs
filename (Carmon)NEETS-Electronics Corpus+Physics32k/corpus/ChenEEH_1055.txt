FIGURE 5.18
(A) This Part of the Figure Shows Logic Section with Unequal Paths to the Output. (B) One Can Reduce the Supply Voltage
Level of the Units on the Fast Section, in this Case Path Y, to Match the Speed of the Stage Critical Path, Path X. (C) Alternatively, one Can
Downsize the Transistors of the Units on Path Y where Speed Is Bound by that of the Critical Path to Reduce the Capacitances. In either case,
one can achieve a considerable power reduction on path Y.
