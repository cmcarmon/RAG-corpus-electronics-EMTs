■● Management by supportive managers and super-
visors is essential in supporting a  diversity plan to 
get maximum results.
Workplace diversity challenges weigh considerably 
on an employer’s success. These challenges serve to 
improve employee relationships and to promote diver-
sity when handled correctly. These challenges can help 
their employees to decrease workplace tension, foster 
a positive place to work and grow as an employee, im-
prove productivity, and improve their relationships 
with management and fellow employees.
