Conceptually, it is relatively easy to extrapolate from known properties
of a battery to postulate an ideal voltage source as a device that maintains a
constant voltage at its terminals regardless of the amount of current drawn
from those terminals. To distinguish such an ideal element from a battery16
(see Figure 1.26a), we denote a voltage source by a single circle with polarity
