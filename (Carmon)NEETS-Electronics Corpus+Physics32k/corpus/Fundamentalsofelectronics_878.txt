Figure 6.19: Morse and Huﬀman Codes for American-Roman Alphabet. The % column indicates the
average probability (expressed in percent) of the letter occurring in English. The entropy H (A) of the
this source is 4.14 bits. The average Morse codeword length is 2.5 symbols. Adding one more symbol for
the letter separator and converting to bits yields an average codeword length of 5.56 bits. The average
Huﬀman codeword length is 4.35 bits.
