A38. When the waves do not go through their maximum and minimum points at the same time, a PHASE 
DIFFERENCE exists, and the two waves are said to be out of phase. (Two waves are also 
considered to be out of phase if they differ in phase by 180Â°  and their instantaneous voltages are 
always of opposite polarity, even though both waves go through their maximum and minimum 
points at the same time).
