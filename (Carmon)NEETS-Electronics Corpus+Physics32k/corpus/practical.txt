A Łukaszyk–Karmowski metric may be used instead of a metric operator (commonly the Euclidean distance) in various numerical methods, and in particular in approximation algorithms such us radial basis function networks , inverse distance weighting or Kohonen self-organizing maps.
This approach is physically based, allowing the real uncertainty in the location of the sample points to be considered.
