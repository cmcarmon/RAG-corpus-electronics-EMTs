HMS E36 was an E-class submarine built by John Brown, Clydebank for the Royal Navy. She was laid down on 7 January 1915 and was commissioned on 16 November 1916.
E36 was sunk in a collision with E43 off Harwich in the North Sea on 19 January 1917. There were no survivors. On 15 September 2013, Dutch fisherman Hans Eelman found a large metal object near the island of Texel, using sonar. The object was thought to be the wreck of a submarine of the E-type and was thought to be E36, but later reports proved it was not.
