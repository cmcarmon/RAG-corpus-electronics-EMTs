5. Internal organization of the memories: The memory
can be meant for capacities that remain small or that
can become large. Here, a trade-off is usually involved
between speed and area efﬁciency. The registerﬁles in
subsection 2.2.2 constitute an example of the fast small
capacity organizations that are usually also dual-ported
or even multiported. The queues and stacks are meant
for medium-sized capacities. The RAMs in subsection
2.2.3 can become extremely large (up to 256 Mb for
the state-of-the-art RAM) but are also much slower in
random access.
