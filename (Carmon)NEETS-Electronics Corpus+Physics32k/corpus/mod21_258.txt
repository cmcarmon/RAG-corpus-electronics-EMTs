Fixed rf attenuators (shown in fig. 2-28), such as the ones commonly found in power-measuring sets,
are designed to provide a fixed-signal attenuation over a specific frequency range. Frequency ranges can
be in excess of 30 gigahertz, and attenuation factors are typically in 1-, 3-, 6-, and 10-dB steps. Fixed
attenuators can be connected in series to provide you with the desired attenuation. Most fixed rf
attenuators are designed to handle only small amounts of rf power and are extremely susceptible to
damage because of overloading. To test a fixed rf attenuator, you can either substitute it with a known
good attenuator or perform basic measurements on the attenuator itself. With the rf substitution method,
you connect an rf signal generator to a power meter and establish a suitable reference point on the meter
by adjusting the power output of the signal generator. Once you establish the reference point, insert the rf
attenuator between the signal generator and the power meter. You then determine the attenuation by
noting the difference between the power meter reading and the initial reference point.
