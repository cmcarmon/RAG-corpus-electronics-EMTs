According to the theory of special relativity, the frame of the ship has a different clock rate and distance measure, and the notion of simultaneity in the direction of motion is altered, so the addition law for velocities is changed. This change is not noticeable at low velocities but as the velocity increases towards the speed of light it becomes important. The addition law is also called a composition law for velocities. For collinear motions, the speed of the object (e.g. a cannonball fired horizontally out to sea) as measured from the ship would be measured by someone standing on the shore and watching the whole scene through a telescope as

{\displaystyle u={v+u' \over 1+(vu'/c^{2})}.}

The composition formula can take an algebraically equivalent form, which can be easily derived by using only the principle of constancy of the speed of light,

{\displaystyle {c-u \over c+u}=\left({c-u' \over c+u'}\right)\left({c-v \over c+v}\right).}

The cosmos of special relativity consists of Minkowski spacetime and the addition of velocities corresponds to composition of Lorentz transformations. In the special theory of relativity Newtonian mechanics is modified into relativistic mechanics.
