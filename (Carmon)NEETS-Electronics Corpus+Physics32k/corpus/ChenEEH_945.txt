which corresponds to the last row of equations 4.61 and 4.67,
respectively. As mentioned previously in Section 4.4.3, the
symmetric matrix M is always positive-deﬁnite20 and nonsin-
gular, thereby permitting exactly one solution ^ll of the linear
system described by equation 4.75.
This linear system is a large square system of the type
Ax ¼ b, where b 2 Rn is a column vector and where the coef-
ﬁcient matrix A 2 Rnn is dense. Typically, the most effective
approach to computing the solution ^xx 2 Rn of such systems
consists of performing a triangular decomposition21 of the
coefﬁcient matrix A followed by the successive solution of
two relatively ‘‘easy’’ to solve square linear systems of order
n  n. The triangular decomposition of A is of the form
A ¼ LU , where L and U are a lower triangular and an upper
triangular matrix, respectively (Golub and Loan, 1996; For-
sythe and Moler, 1967). The solution of Ax ¼ LUx ¼ b is
obtained next by ﬁrst computing the intermediate solution ^yy
of the system Ly ¼ b. Finally, ^xx is the solution of the system
