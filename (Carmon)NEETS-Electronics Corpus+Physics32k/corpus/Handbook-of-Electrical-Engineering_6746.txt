A  MAC  scheme  that  is  widely  used  with  the  bus  topology  is  carrier-sense  multiple  access  (CSMA).  A
contention protocol, CSMA operates by allowing any station to transmit a buffered packet if it senses that the
bus is idle. If two stations are ready to transmit their packets at nearly the same time, they will both sense that
the bus is idle and their transmissions will collide, i.e., the superimposed bits of the packets will be garbled.
The propagation delay—or time it takes for the packet to travel from one station to the other—dictates the
window  of  vulnerability  for  CSMA;  the  larger  the  window,  the  more  collisions  are  likely.  To  overcome  the
problem of collisions, CSMA is often enhanced with collision detection (CSMA/CD) by enabling stations to
monitor  their  transmissions  for  the  garbled  bits  associated  with  collisions. When  a  collision  is  detected,  the
station aborts its transmission and reschedules it by backing off for a period of time. The binary exponential
backoff algorithm speciﬁes that the random backoff time is drawn uniformly from the interval between 0 and
2n – 1 time units, where n is the number of times the packet has collided.
