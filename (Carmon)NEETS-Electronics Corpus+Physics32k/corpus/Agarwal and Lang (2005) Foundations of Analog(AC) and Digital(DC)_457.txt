which are the individual statements of KCL for Nodes 1 and 2. Following this,
in the second part of Step 3, the currents are eliminated by substituting node
voltages and element parameters in their place. In our example, i1 and i2 are
determined using e1 and the parameters of the elements through which i1 and
i2 flow. Similarly i3 and i4 are determined using e1 + V and the parameters of
the elements through which i3 and i4 flow, with e1 serving as the one unknown
node voltage.
Alternatively, i1 and i2 can be determined using e2âˆ’V, and i3 and i4 can be
determined using e2, with e2 serving as the one unknown node voltage. Finally,
it should be recognized that a floating string of independent voltage sources is
handled in exactly the same manner as a floating isolated independent voltage
source.
