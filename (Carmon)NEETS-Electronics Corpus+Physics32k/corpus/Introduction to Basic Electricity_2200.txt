Magnetic	induction is the effect a magnet has on an 
object without physical contact. For example, a mag-
net may induce a magnetic field in an iron bar (Figure 
18-12). In passing through the iron bar, the magnetic 
lines of force cause the domains in the iron bar to 
align in one direction. The iron bar is now a magnet. 
The domains in the iron bar align themselves with 
their south pole toward the north pole of the magnet, 
 because  opposite poles attract. For the same reason, 
the iron bar is drawn toward the magnet. The flux lines 
now leave from the end of the iron bar; the iron bar is 
an extension of the magnet. This is an effective way to 
increase the length or change the shape of a magnet 
without physically altering it.
