heats  the  water  from  about  550  to  about  650
F.  High  pressure,  at  about  2235  psi,  prevents
boiling. Pressure is maintained by a pressurizer, and the water is circulated by a pump through a heat exchanger.
The heat exchanger evaporates the feedwater and generates steam, which supplies a system similar to a con-
ventional power plant. The advantage of this two-loop system is the separation of the potentially radioactive
reactor cooling ï¬‚uid from the water-steam system.
