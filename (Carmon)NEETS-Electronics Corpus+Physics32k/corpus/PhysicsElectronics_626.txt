6.2.6 Diﬀerential Ampliﬁers
The diﬀerential ampliﬁer ampliﬁes the diﬀerence between two input signals (−) and (+).
This ampliﬁer is also referred to as a diﬀerential-input single-ended output ampliﬁer. It is
a precision voltage diﬀerence ampliﬁer, and forms the central basis of more sophisticated
instrumentation ampliﬁer circuits.
