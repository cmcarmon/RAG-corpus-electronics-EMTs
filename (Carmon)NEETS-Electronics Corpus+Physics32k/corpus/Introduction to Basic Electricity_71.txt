a	circuit
Decibel	–	it	is	a	unit	of	measurement	that	represent	the	gain	in	either
current,	power,	or	voltage;	since	it	is	only	a	tenth	of	the	original	unit,	Bel,	it
is	primarily	reserved	for	denoting	extremely	small	amounts
Time	constant	–	it	is	a	unit	of	measurement	that	describes	the	output	of	a
circuit’s	minimum	or	maximum	output	value;	in	a	way,	it	refers	to	the
measurement	of	time	reaction
Watt-hour	–	it	is	the	unit	of	measurement	that	describes	the	electrical
energy	consumption	over	a	period	of	time
