When apparent temperatures are between 90 and 105 degrees, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and 
heatstroke are possible after prolonged exposure and physical activity. These become likely when 
apparent temperatures are between 105 and 130 degrees. Over 130 degrees, heatstroke is imminent. You 
should note that heatstroke can be fatal if medical care is delayed.
