Devices that convert control signals from one form to another are known as transducers, most
of which have an output signal in the form of electric energy. For example, a potentiometer is used
to convert a mechanical position to an electric voltage, a tachometer generator converts a velocity
into a voltage (dc or ac), and a pressure transducer indicates a pressure drop (or rise) in terms
of a corresponding drop (or rise) in electric potential. Thus, a transducer translates the command
signal appropriately into an electrical form usable by the system, and forms an important part
of control systems. Electromechanical transducers form a link between electric and mechanical
systems.
