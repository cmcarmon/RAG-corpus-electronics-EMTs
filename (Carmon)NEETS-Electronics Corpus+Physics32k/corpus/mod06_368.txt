These same principles also apply to the CRT used in your use of your major tool: the
OSCILLOSCOPE. Remember, the unique function of a CRT is to convert electronic (and electrical)
signals to a visual display. This function of a CRT is used in the oscilloscope to show the waveform of an
electronic signal. To help you understand better how an oscilloscope works, we will discuss the type of
deflection used in oscilloscopes. Bear in mind that the following discussion is only about deflection; we
will cover the actual operation of an oscilloscope in a later NEETS module that deals specifically with
test equipment.
