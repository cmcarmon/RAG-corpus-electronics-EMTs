Solutions to Exercises in Chapter 3
Solution to Exercise 3.1 (p. 32)
One kilowatt-hour equals 3,600,000 watt-seconds, which indeed directly corresponds to 3,600,000 joules.
Solution to Exercise 3.2 (p. 36)
KCL says that the sum of currents entering or leaving a node must be zero. If we consider two nodes together
as a “supernode,” KCL applies as well to currents entering the combination. Since no currents enter an entire
circuit, the sum of currents must be zero. If we had a two-node circuit, the KCL equation of one must
be the negative of the other, We can combine all but one node in a circuit into a supernode; KCL for the
supernode must be the negative of the remaining node’s KCL equation. Consequently, specifying n− 1 KCL
equations always speciﬁes the remaining one.
