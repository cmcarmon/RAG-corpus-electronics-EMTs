A typical red LED requires a current of around 
10 mA to provide a reasonably bright display and 
such  a  device  may  be  directly  driven  from  a 
buffered  digital  output  port.  Different  connections 
are used depending upon whether the LED is to be 
illuminated  for  a  logic  0  or  logic  1  state.  Several 
possibilities are shown in Fig. 16.25.
