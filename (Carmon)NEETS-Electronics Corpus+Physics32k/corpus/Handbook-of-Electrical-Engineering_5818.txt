For a comprehensive coverage of general transformer theory, see Chapter 2 of Electric Machines by G.R. Slemon
and A. Straughen (Addison-Wesley, 1980). For transformer standards, see ANSI Standard C57. For a detailed
explanation of transformer per-unit scaling, see Chapter 5 of Power Systems Analysis by C.A. Gross (John Wiley,
1986). For design information see Practical Transformer Design Handbook by E. Lowden (TAB, 1989).
