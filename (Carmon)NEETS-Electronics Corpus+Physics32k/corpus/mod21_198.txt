 3. Prior to opening an electrostatic unit package of an ESDS device or assembly, clip the free end of
the grounded test lead to the package. This will cause any static electricity that may have built up
on the package to discharge. The other end remains connected to the equipment frame or other
ESD ground. Keep the unit package grounded until the replacement device or assembly is placed
in the unit package.
