In Figure 8.6, CLv and CLa are the victim and the aggressor
load capacitances respectively. Rdv and Rda are the victim and
the aggressor drivers modeled by resistances. Cc1 and Cc2
are the coupling capacitance between the two wires distributed
to the beginning and the end of the wires. Cv1, Cv2, Ca1, and
Ca2 are the distributed area capacitances for the victim and
aggressor wires respectively. In the 4p model found in Becer
