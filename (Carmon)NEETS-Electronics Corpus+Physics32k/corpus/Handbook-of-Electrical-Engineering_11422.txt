Leakage Current
Germanium detectors need to be cooled to reduce leakage current. There are several potential sources of leakage
current, including diffusion of minority carriers from either doped contact into the depletion region, thermal
generation  of  carriers  at  either  bulk  or  surface  defects  in  the  depletion  region,  and  electrical  breakdown  at
points  where  the  electrical  Ô¨Åeld  is  concentrated  due  to  irregularities  in  the  contact  geometry,  large-scale
inhomogeneities  in  the  bulk,  or  surface  states.  Current  will  also  be  generated  if  the  detector  is  not  shielded
from room-temperature infrared radiation. Background nuclear radiation from materials near the detector and
cosmic radiation also generate current.
