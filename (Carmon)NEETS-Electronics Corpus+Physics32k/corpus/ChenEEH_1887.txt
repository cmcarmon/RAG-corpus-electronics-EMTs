The trustworthiness of a computer system is characterized by
its dependability. A system is dependable if ‘‘reliance can
justiﬁably be placed on the service it delivers’’ (Laprie, 1992).
There are many aspects under which a system can be depend-
able: two of the most important ones are reliability and safety.
The ﬁrst, reliability, is the ability to guarantee the continuity of
the service provided, and the last, safety, is the certainty of
avoidance of catastrophic consequences on the environment,
either people or the system itself (Yu and Johnson, 2002;
Johnson, 1989; Prasad, 1989). The reliability of a system is a
time-dependent function and, unfortunately, cannot be always
assured. System failures occur when the service of the system
does not comply with the speciﬁcation, and the behavior of the
system deviates from that required by the user.
