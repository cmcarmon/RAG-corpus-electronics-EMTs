In the Viterbi approach, the mean vectors and covariance
matrices for the observation densities are reestimated by
simple averaging, similarly to what is done in the discrete-
observation procedure. This is easily described when there is
only one mixture component per state. In this case, for a given
M, the recognition experiment is performed on the observa-
tion sequence. Each observation vector is then assigned to the
state that produced it on the optimal path by examining the
backtracking information. The vectors assigned to each state
are then used to update the mean vector and covariance matrix
for that state, and the process is repeated.
