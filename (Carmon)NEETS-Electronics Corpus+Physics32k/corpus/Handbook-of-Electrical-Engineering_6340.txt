The Need for DAB
In the years since the early 1980s, the consumer marketplace has undergone a great shift toward digital electronic
technology.  The  explosion  of  personal  computer  use  has  led  to  greater  demands  for  information,  including
multimedia integration. Over the same time period, compact disc (CD) digital audio technology has overtaken
long-playing records (and has nearly overtaken analog tape cassettes) as the consumer audio playback media
of choice. Similar digital transcription methods and effects also have been incorporated into commonly available
audio and video equipment. Additionally, it is virtually certain that the upcoming transition to a high-deÔ¨Ånition
television broadcast system will incorporate full digital methods for video and audio transmission. Because of
these  market  pressures,  the  radio  broadcast  industry  has  determined  that  the  existing  analog  methods  of
broadcasting must be updated to keep pace with the advancing audio marketplace.
