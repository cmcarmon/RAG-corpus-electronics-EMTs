If required, farmers' responses to waterlogging and soil salinity can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:
The amount of irrigation water applied when the water table becomes shallower depending on the kind of crop (paddy rice and non-rice)
The fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce;
The fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a stochastic interpretation;
The groundwater abstraction by pumping from wells when the water table drops.
The farmers' responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in turn, slows down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately a new equilibrium situation will arise.
The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect first and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.
