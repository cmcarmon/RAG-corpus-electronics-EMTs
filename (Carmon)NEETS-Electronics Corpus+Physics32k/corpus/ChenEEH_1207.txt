The current trend of technology scaling is predicted to con-
tinue. Feature sizes will continue to shrink and clock frequen-
cies will continue to increase. Shrinking feature size implies
not only shorter gate lengths but also decreasing interconnect
pitch and device threshold voltages (Shepard and Narayanan,
1998). The total wire area capacitance will decrease due to the
reduction of the areas of a minimum-width wire. Resistance,
however, is increasing faster despite efforts not to scale metal
thickness. Moreover, the crosscoupling capacitance between
neighboring wires will increase due to the decrease in spacing
between wires. The expectation for the die sizes is to remain
constant in spite of the feature size shrinking. This is due to the
integration of more functionality on a single chip. Practical
efforts to control RC delays through the use of a low-resistivity
metal (copper), low-dielectric-constant insulators, and thick
wiring that is wide will require interconnection analysis to
consider inductance and inductive coupling. Figures 8.1 and
8.2 show the difference between older silicon technology and
the current deep submicron technology.
