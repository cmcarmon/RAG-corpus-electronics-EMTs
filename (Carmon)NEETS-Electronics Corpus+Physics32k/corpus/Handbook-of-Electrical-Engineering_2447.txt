In the nonsaturated region IDS is a function of both VGS and VDS, and in the lower portion of the nonsaturated
region where VDS is small compared to VP ,  IDS becomes an approximately linear function of VDS. This linear
portion of the nonsaturated is called the voltage-variable resistance (VVR) region, for in this region the JFET
acts like a linear resistance element between source and drain. The resistance is variable in that it is controlled
by the gate voltage. This region and VVR application will be discussed in a later section. The JFET can also be
operated in this region as a switch, and this will also be discussed in a later section.
