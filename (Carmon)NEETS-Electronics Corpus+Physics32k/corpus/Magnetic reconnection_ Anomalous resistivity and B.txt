In the Sweet-Parker model, the common assumption is that the magnetic diffusivity is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
and electric charge



e


{\displaystyle e}
:

v


,


{\displaystyle {d{\mathbf {v} } \over dt}={e \over m}{\mathbf {E} }-\nu {\mathbf {v} },}

where



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state,

{\displaystyle d{\mathbf {v} }/dt=0}
, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current,

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {J} }=en{\mathbf {v} }}
, where



n

is the electron number density, yields

{\displaystyle \eta =\nu {c^{2} \over \omega _{pi}^{2}}.}

Nevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity,

{\displaystyle \eta _{anom}}
, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet-Parker model by a factor of

{\displaystyle \eta _{anom}/\eta }

Another proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with

{\displaystyle v_{A}^{2}(mc/eB)}
, however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations.
