Figure 3-29 shows how both of these transfers occur. In each case, the four-bit word 1101 is being
transferred to a storage device. In view A, the data moves along a single line. Each bit of the data will be
stored by an individual control pulse. In view B, each bit has a separate input line. One control pulse will
cause the entire word to be stored.
