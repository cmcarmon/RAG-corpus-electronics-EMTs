High power gyrotron from CPI. The 110-GHz gyrotron is the current world record holder
for high frequency power generation. This gyrotron is used in electron cyclotron reso-
nance  heating  (ECRH)  by  producing  extremely  high  frequencies  of  microwaves  which
heat a hydrogen gas — “plasma” — to very high levels in experimental fusion reactors.
In  the  photo,  the  lower  section  is  the  electron  gun  region  that  generates  extremely
high-powered electron beam. Shown in the middle section of the gyrotron is an interactive
window.  The  produced  microwave  power  is  transformed  into  a  microwave  beam  that
then passes through the high power interaction window. The large upper section is a fully
instrumented collector of the “spent” electron beam. (Photo courtesy of Communications
