In terms of visual stargazing with a large amateur telescope, this object may not jump out at the viewer. As of June 25, 2011, it was holding reasonably steady at magnitude 12.7. At that time, the supernova was about 300 times fainter than the naked eye magnitude of 6.5. The supernova is an easy target for an amateur telescope equipped with a modern CCD camera under a dark sky.
