Graphics and animation include static media types like digital
images and dynamic media types like ï¬‚ash presentations. An
uncompressed, digitally encoded image consists of an array of
pixels, with each pixel encoded in a number of bits to represent
luminance and color. Compared to text or digital audio, digital
images tend to be large in size. For example, a typical 4  6
inch digital image, with a spatial resolution of 480  640 pixels
and color resolution of 24 bits requires  1 MB of storage. To
transmit this image on a 56.6 Kbps line will take at least 2 min.
If the image is compressed at the modest 10:1 compression
ratio, the storage is reduced to  100 KB, and transmission
time drops to  14 sec. Thus, some form of compression
schemes is always used that cashes on the property of high
spatial redundancy in digital images. Some popular compres-
sion schemes (Salomon, 1998) are illustrated in Table 7.3. Most
modern image compression schemes are progressive and have
