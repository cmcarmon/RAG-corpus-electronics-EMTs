The second law follows instantly from the second of the three equations to calculate the absolute value of the specific relative angular momentum.
If one connects this form of the equation

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} t={\frac {r^{2}}{h}}\ \mathrm {d} \theta }
with the relationship

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} A={\frac {r^{2}}{2}}\ \mathrm {d} \theta }
for the area of a sector with an infinitesimal small angle




d

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \theta }
(triangle with one very small side), the equation

{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} t={\frac {2}{h}}\ \mathrm {d} A}

comes out, that is the mathematical formulation of the words:

The line joining the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
