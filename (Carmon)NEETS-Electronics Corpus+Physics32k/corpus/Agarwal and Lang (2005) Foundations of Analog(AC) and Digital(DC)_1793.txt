S1 Open, S2 Closed: Series RLC Circuit When S1 is open and S2 is closed, we
have the driven, series RLC circuit shown in Figure 12.44, which is identical to the
circuit in Figure 12.26. This time around, we will analyze this circuit from first principles
following the method shown in Section 12.2. First, let us collect our information on the
drive voltage and the initial conditions. We know that the drive voltage for the circuit is V.
Let us now determine the initial conditions. For convenience, we will take t = 0 as
the instant that S1 is opened and S2 is closed. The state of the circuit at t = 0 is
given by
