As previously mentioned, digital multimeters present a high input impedance to the circuit under test
and are fairly accurate. Many earlier models had very limited frequency responses. Even today the upper
frequency limitations of digital multimeters vary from 20 kilohertz to over 300 kilohertz, depending on
the model. Their upper frequency limitations can, however, be significantly extended by using optional rf
probes. When you perform ac voltage measurements with a digital multimeter, remember that they are
true rms indicating devices.
