where w(n) is Gaussian white noise whose real and imaginary components have standard deviation 0.05. When
estimation procedures (14.136) and (14.137) are applied to the original data with p = 17 (the choice advocated
by  Tufts  and  Kumaresan  [1982])  and  m  =  3,  the  spectral  estimates  shown  in  Fig. 14.20  arise.  Each  estimate
