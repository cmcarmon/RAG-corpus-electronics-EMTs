extract useful information from it. Image restoration tech-
niques aim at processing corrupted images from which there
is a statistical or mathematical description of the degradation so
that it can be reverted. Image analysis techniques permit that an
image be processed so that information can be automatically
extracted from it. Examples of
image analysis are image
segmentation, edge extraction, and texture and motion analysis.
An important characteristic of images is the huge amount
of
information required to represent them. Even a gray-
scale image of moderate resolution, say 512  512, needs
512  512  8  2  106 bits for its representation. Therefore,
to be practical to store and transmit digital images, one needs to
perform some sort of image compression, whereby the redun-
dancy of the images is exploited for reducing the number of bits
needed in their representation.
