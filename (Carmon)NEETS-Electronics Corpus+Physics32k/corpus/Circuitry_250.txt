Bipolar junction transistors 
 
Transistor  is  short  for  transfer  resistor,  a  term 
which provides something of a clue as to how the 
device  operates;  the  current  flowing  in  the  output 
circuit is determined by the current flowing in the 
input  circuit.  Since  transistors  are  three-terminal 
devices,  one  electrode  must  remain  common  to 
both the input and the output. 
  Transistors fall into two main categories: bipolar 
junction  transistors  (BJT) and field  effect  tran-
sistors  (FET) and  are  also  classified  according  to 
the  semiconductor  material  employed  (silicon  or 
germanium)  and  to  their  field  of  application  (e.g. 
general-purpose,  switching,  high-frequency,  etc.). 
Various classes of transistor are available according 
to the application concerned (see Table 5.8).
