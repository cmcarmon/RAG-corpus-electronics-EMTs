We begin with the magnitude of the electrostatic force (in newtons) between two point charges



q


{\displaystyle q}
and



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
(in coulombs). It is convenient to label one of these charges,



q


{\displaystyle q}
, as a test charge, and call



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
a source charge. As we develop the theory, more source charges will be added. If



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance (in meters) between two charges, then the force is:

{\displaystyle F={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {qQ}{r^{2}}}=k_{0}{\frac {qQ}{r^{2}}}\,,}

where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, or permittivity of free space:

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}\approx {10^{-9} \over 36\pi }\;\;\mathrm {C^{2}\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}} \approx 8.854\ 187\ 817\times 10^{-12}\;\;\mathrm {C^{2}\ N^{-1}\ m^{-2}} .}

The SI units of ε0 are equivalently  A2s4 kg−1m−3 or C2N−1m−2 or F m−1. Coulomb's constant is:

{\displaystyle k_{0}\approx {\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}\approx 8.987\ 551\ 787\times 10^{9}\;\;\mathrm {N\ m^{2}\ C} ^{-2}.}

The use of ε0 instead of k0 in expressing Coulomb's Law is related to the fact that the force is inversely proportional to the surface area of a sphere with radius equal to the separation between the two charges.
A single proton has a charge of e, and the electron has a charge of −e, where,

These physical constants (ε0, k0, e) are currently defined so that ε0 and k0 are exactly defined, and e is a measured quantity.
