with boundary conditions M(tF ) ¼ QF and V(tF ) ¼ 0. Once
again, if g approaches zero, classic LQG results are obtained.
This MCV idea can be generalized to minimize any cost
cumulants. Viewing the cost function as a random variable
and optimizing any cost cumulant is called cost-cumulant or
statistical control.
