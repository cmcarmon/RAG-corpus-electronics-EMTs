The  mapping  between  the  three  levels  of  abstraction  is  the  task  of  the
DBMS. When changes to the internal level (such as a change in ﬁle organi-
zation) do not affect the conceptual and external levels, the system is said to
prevents
provide  for 
users’  views.  Both  types  of  data
changes  to  the  conceptual  level  to  affect
independence are desired features in a database system.
