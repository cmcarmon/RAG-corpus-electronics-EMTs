Figure 2.55b introduces our shorthand notation. First, batteries that serve as power
supplies are often not shown explicitly and use the upwards pointing arrow notation
instead. VS represents the power supply voltage. Often, we are also interested in mea-
suring voltages with respect to a common reference node, termed the ground node. This
node is represented with an upside-down ‘‘T’’ symbol as shown in the figure. The polar-
ity symbols corresponding to voltages that are referenced from this node are not shown
explicitly. Rather, the negative symbol is associated with the ground node and the plus
symbol is associated with the node adjacent to which the voltage variable appears.4
Now, referring to Figure 2.55b, suppose R1 = R2 = R3 = 10 k, how do we choose
RL such that VO < 1 V?
