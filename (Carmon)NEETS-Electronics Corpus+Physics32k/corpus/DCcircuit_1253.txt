Conversely, when the voltage across a capacitor is decreased, the capacitor supplies current
to the rest of the circuit, acting as a power source. In this condition the capacitor is said to
be discharging. Its store of energy – held in the electric ﬁeld – is decreasing now as energy
is released to the rest of the circuit. Note the direction of electron current with regard to the
voltage polarity:
