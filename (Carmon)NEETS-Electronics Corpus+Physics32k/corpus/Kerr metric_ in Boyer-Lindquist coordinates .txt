The Kerr metric describes the geometry of spacetime in the vicinity of a mass M rotating with angular momentum J. The line element in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates is

where the coordinates

are standard spherical coordinate system, which are equivalent to the cartesian coordinates

and rs is the Schwarzschild radius

and where the length-scales a, Σ and Δ have been introduced for brevity

A key feature to note in the above metric is the cross product

term. There is coupling between time and motion in the plane of rotation that disappears when the black hole's angular momentum goes to zero.
In the non-relativistic limit where M (or, equivalently, rs) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the oblate spheroidal coordinates

The total mass equivalent M (the gravitating mass) of the body (including its rotational energy) and its irreducible mass Mirr are related by

{\displaystyle M_{\rm {irr}}={\sqrt {\frac {{\sqrt {M^{4}-a^{2}M^{2}}}+M^{2}}{2}}}\ \to \ M=2{\sqrt {\frac {M_{\rm {irr}}^{4}}{4M_{\rm {irr}}^{2}-a^{2}}}}}
.
If the complete rotational energy Erot=c²(M-Mirr) of a black hole is extracted, for example with the Penrose process, the remaining mass cannot shrink below the irreducible mass. Therefore, if a black hole rotates with the spin a=M, its total mass-equivalent M is higher by a factor of √2 in comparison with a corresponding Schwarzschild black hole where M is equal to Mirr. The reason for this is that in order to get a static body to spin, energy needs to be applied to the system. Because of the mass–energy equivalence this energy also has a mass-equivalent, which adds to the total mass-energy of the system, M.
