(cid:1) We have chosen to model the Op Amp by the dependent source of
Figure 15.6, which is a voltage-controlled voltage source, for obvious
reasons.
(cid:1) Although the +12 volt and âˆ’12 volt DC power supplies are obviously
necessary for Op Amp operation, (they power the voltage-controlled
voltage source), their inclusion in the circuit model we use for analysis is
not very helpful, because the KCL calculation does not yield a
