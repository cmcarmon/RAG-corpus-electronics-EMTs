AND logic 
 
Now consider the circuit with two switches shown 
in Fig. 10.3. Here the lamp will only operate when 
switch  A  is  closed  and  switch  B  is  closed. 
However, letâ€™s look at the operation of the circuit in 
a little more detail.  
  Since there are two switches (A and B) and there 
are  two  possible  states  for  each  switch  (open  or 
closed), there is a total of four possible conditions 
for the circuit. We can summarize these conditions 
in Table 10.2. 
  Since each switch can only be in one of the two 
states  (i.e.  open  or  closed)  at  any  given  time,  the 
open and closed conditions are mutually exclusive. 
Furthermore, since the switches cannot exist in any 
other  state  than  completely  open  or  completely 
closed  (i.e.  there  are  no  intermediate  states)  the 
circuit uses binary logic. We can thus represent the 
logical  states  of  the  two  switches  by  the  binary 
digits, 0 and 1. 
  Once  again,  if  we  adopt  the  convention  that  an 
open switch can be represented by 0 and a closed 
switch by 1, we can rewrite the truth table in terms 
of the binary states shown in Fig. 10.4 where:
