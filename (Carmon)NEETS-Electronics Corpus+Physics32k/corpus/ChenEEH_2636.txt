theory in the low-frequency limit where approximate analyses
of many complex geometries have been obtained with as-
tounding success. At the other end of the spectrum, high-
frequency ray theory, diffraction theory, and perturbation
theory were developed to provide approximate solutions to
Maxwellâ€™s equations. Recently, with the advent of computer
technology, numerical methods were developed in the 1960s to
allow more versatility and accuracy in the solution methods.
