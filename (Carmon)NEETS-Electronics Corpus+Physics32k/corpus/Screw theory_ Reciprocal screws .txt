If the virtual work of a wrench on a twist is zero, then the forces and torque of the wrench are constraint forces relative to the twist. The wrench and twist are said to be reciprocal, that is if

,


{\displaystyle \delta W={\mathsf {W}}[\Pi ]{\mathsf {T}}\delta t=0,}

then the screws W and T are reciprocal.
