Plane-Wave Solution in the Berenger Medium
The next step is to derive the plane-wave solution in the
Berenger medium. To this end, equation 9.97a is differentiated
with respect to y and equation 9.97b with respect to x. Substi-

x=qy from equations
y=qx and qE
tuting the expressions for qE
9.95c and 9.95d leads to:
