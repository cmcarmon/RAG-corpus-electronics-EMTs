Light that is reflected from a magnetized surface can change in both polarization and reflected intensity. The effect is similar to the Faraday effect: the Faraday effect describes changes to light transmitted through a magnetic material, while the Kerr effect describes changes to light reflected from a magnetic surface. Both effects result from the off-diagonal components of the dielectric tensor



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
. These off-diagonal components give the magneto-optic material an anisotropic permittivity, meaning that its permittivity is different in different directions. The permittivity affects the speed of light in a material:

{\displaystyle v_{p}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\varepsilon \mu }}}}

where




v

p




{\displaystyle v_{p}}
is the velocity of light through the material,



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
is the material permittivity, and



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the magnetic permeability; and thus the speed of light varies depending on its orientation. This causes fluctuations in the phase of polarized incident light.
