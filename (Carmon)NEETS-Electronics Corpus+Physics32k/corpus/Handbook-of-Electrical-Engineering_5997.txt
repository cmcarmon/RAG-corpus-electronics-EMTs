Figure 66.34 shows a circuit representation of an idealized synchronous machine with damper windings, kd
and kq, and Ô¨Åeld winding, f, on the rotor. The equivalent circuit representation and equations of the machine
in its own rotor qd0 reference frame and in motor convention are shown in Fig. 66.35 and Table 66.3, respectively.
