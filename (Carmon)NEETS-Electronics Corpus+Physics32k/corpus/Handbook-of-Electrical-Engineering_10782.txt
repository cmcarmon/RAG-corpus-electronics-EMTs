The expected residence time in a state is the mean value of the passage time from the state in question to any
other state. Cycle time is the time required to complete an “in” and “not-in” cycle for that state. Frequency of
occurrence (or encounter) for a state is the reciprocal of its cycle time. It can be shown that the frequency of
occurrence of a state is equal to the steady-state probability of being in that state times the total rate of departure
from it. Also, the expected value of the residence time is equal to the reciprocal of the total rate of departure
from that state.
