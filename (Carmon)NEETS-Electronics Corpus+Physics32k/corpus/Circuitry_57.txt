at these curves you will notice that they flatten off 
due  to  magnetic  saturation  and  that  the  slope  of 
the curve (indicating the value of Âµ corresponding 
to a particular value of H) falls as the magnetizing 
force  increases.  This  is  important  since  it  dictates 
the  acceptable  working  range  for  a  particular 
magnetic material when used in a magnetic circuit.
