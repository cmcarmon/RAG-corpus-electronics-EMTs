Daisy-wheel printers have the most professional-looking, pleasing-to-the-eye print of all the printers 
in the character-at-a-time impact printer class. Daisy-wheel printers are often used in an office or word 
processing environment, where crisp, sharp, high-quality (letter quality) characters are a must. The daisy-
wheel printer uses a round disk, with embossed characters located at the end of each petal-like projection 
(one character per petal), similar to the petals of a daisy, as shown in figure 2-24. A drive motor spins the 
wheel at a high rate of speed. When the desired character spins to the correct position, the print hammer 
strikes that character causing it to be printed on the paper. Once printed, the daisy wheel continues to 
move, searching out the next character to be printed, until the line is completed. The speeds of daisy-
wheel printers range from 30 to 60 characters per second (cps).
