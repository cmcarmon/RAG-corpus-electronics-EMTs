Depletion Capacitances
For reverse and forward biases the capacitances CjEi and CjCi
follow the classical voltage dependence given in equation 5.4.
For typical capacitance curves as a function of bias, see
Figure 5.2. In BJTs, the correct description of CjEi is of most
importance for the forward bias region up to the peak value
