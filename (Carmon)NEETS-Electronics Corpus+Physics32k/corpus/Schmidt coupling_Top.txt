A Schmidt coupling is a type of coupling designed to accommodate large radial displacement between two shafts. Consisting of an arrangement of links and discs—three discs rotating in unison, interconnected in series by six or more links—a Schmidt coupling can adapt to wide variations in radial displacement while running under load.
