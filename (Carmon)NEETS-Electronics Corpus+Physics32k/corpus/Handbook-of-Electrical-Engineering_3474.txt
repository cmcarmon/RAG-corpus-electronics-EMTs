where Tj  and Tf  are the junction and coolant (ï¬‚uid) temperatures, respectively, and qc is the chip heat dissipation.
Unfortunately, however, most measurement techniques are incapable of detecting the actual junction tem-
perature, i.e., the temperature of the small volume at the interface of p-type and n-type semiconductors, and,
hence, this term generally refers to the average temperature or a representative temperature on the chip. Because
