APDU: Application  Protocol  Data  Unit  is  a  set  of  bytes  forming  a  unitary “container”  used  to  send  to  or
receive data from a card. There are two types of APDUs: command APDU (sent to a card) and response
APDU (sent by a card). Formats of both APDUs are different, however, no mismatch is possible as the
communication between a card and the reader is ruled by a sequence: command (reader)-response (card).
API: Application Programming Interface. In general terms, API is a set of functionalities (library) loadable
or preloaded available for a programmer developing the application. In smart card technology, APIs are
found on board the card (e.g., Java Card) as well as on the system side (reader APIs). The goal of creating
API  is  to  free  the  developer  from  card-related  speciﬁc  knowledge  allowing  him/her  to  develop  on  the
higher level of abstraction.
