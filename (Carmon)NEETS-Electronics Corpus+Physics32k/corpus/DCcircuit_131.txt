As stated before, voltage is the measure of potential energy per unit charge available to
motivate electrons from one point to another. Before we can precisely deﬁne what a ”volt”
is, we must understand how to measure this quantity we call ”potential energy.” The general
metric unit for energy of any kind is the joule, equal to the amount of work performed by a
force of 1 newton exerted through a motion of 1 meter (in the same direction). In British units,
this is slightly less than 3/4 pound of force exerted over a distance of 1 foot. Put in common
terms, it takes about 1 joule of energy to lift a 3/4 pound weight 1 foot off the ground, or to
drag something a distance of 1 foot using a parallel pulling force of 3/4 pound. Deﬁned in these
scientiﬁc terms, 1 volt is equal to 1 joule of electric potential energy per (divided by) 1 coulomb
of charge. Thus, a 9 volt battery releases 9 joules of energy for every coulomb of electrons
moved through a circuit.
