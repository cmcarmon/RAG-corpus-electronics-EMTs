Astrophysics employs physical principles "to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in space."

A landmark article of stellar physics, analysing several key processes that might be responsible for the synthesis of chemical elements in nature and their relative abundances; it is credited with originating what is now the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis.
