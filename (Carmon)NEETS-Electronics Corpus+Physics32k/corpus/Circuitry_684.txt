Square waveforms (single-channel operation) 
The  procedure  for  displaying  a  repetitive  square 
waveform is shown in Fig. 14.28. Once again, the 
signal is connected to the Channel 1 input (but this 
time with ‘DC’ input selected) and the mode switch 
in  the  Channel  1  position.  ‘Channel  1’  must  be 
selected as the trigger  source and the trigger level 
control adjusted for a stable display (which can be 
triggered on the positive or negative going edge of 
the waveform according to the setting of the trigger 
polarity button). Any DC level present on the input 
can  be  measured  from  the  offset  produced  on  the 
Y-axis. To do this, you must first select ‘GND’ on 
the input selector then centre the trace along the Y-
axis  before  switching  to  ‘DC’  and  noting  how  far 
up or down the trace moves (above or below 0 V). 
This  may  sound  a  little  difficult  but  it  is  actually 
quite easy to do! The same technique can be used 
for  measuring  any  DC  offset  present  on  a 
sinusoidal signal.
