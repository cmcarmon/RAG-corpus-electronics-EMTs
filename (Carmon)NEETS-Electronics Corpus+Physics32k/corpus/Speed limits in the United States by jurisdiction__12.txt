The US territory of Puerto Rico regulates and posts speed limits in miles per hour, although highway signage for distances are in kilometers. Some people are hoping to have the speed limit in autopistas raised to 70 mph, along with 60 mph for trucks. Tolled Autopistas as of 2015, can have speed limits up to 65 mph, while other expressways have speed limits up to 60 mph. The rural default speed limit is 45 mph but may be increased to 55 mph. In residential areas, only multilane roads have limits up to 35 mph, other roads are restricted to a maximum speed of 25 mph. Only rural school zones have the higher 25 mph limit. Speed limits for "heavy motor vehicles", such as school buses, are always 10 mph lower than that allowed for lighter vehicles, except in urban school zones where the limit is 20 mph. Vehicles carrying hazardous materials are limited to 30 mph in rural areas and 20 mph in urban ones.
