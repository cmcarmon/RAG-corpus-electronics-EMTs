Hierarchical Databases
The hierarchical data model [Elmasri and Navathe, 1994] uses a tree data structure to conceptualize associations
between different record types. In this model, record types are represented as nodes and associations as links.
Each record type, except the root, has only one parent; that is, only parent-child (or one-to-many) relationships
are allowed. This restriction gives hierarchical databases their simplicity. Since links are only one way, from a
parent to a child, the design of hierarchical database management systems is made simpler, and only a small
set of data manipulation commands are needed.
