Feedback is used to control and stabilize the ampliﬁer gain. The open-loop gain is too
large to be useful since noise will causes the circuit to clip. Stabilization is obtained by
feeding the output back into the input (closed negative feedback loop).
In this way the
closed-loop gain does not depend on the ampliﬁer characteristics.
