This chapter introduces devices that are made from 
materials that are neither conductors nor insulators. 
These  semiconductor  materials  form  the  basis  of 
diodes,  thyristors,  triacs,  transistors  and  integrated 
circuits.  We  start 
this  chapter  with  a  brief 
introduction  to  the  principles  of  semiconductors 
before  going  on  to  examine  the  characteristics  of 
each of the most common types of semiconductor. 
 
the  simplified 
structure  of  an  atom  and  showed  that  it  contains 
both  negative  charge  carriers  (electrons)  and 
positive  charge  carriers  (protons).  Electrons  each 
carry a single unit of negative electric charge while 
protons  each  exhibit  a  single  unit  of  positive 
charge.  Since  atoms  normally  contain  an  equal 
number  of  electrons  and  protons,  the  net  charge 
present  will  be  zero.  For  example,  if  an  atom  has 
eleven electrons, it will also contain eleven protons. 
The  end  result  is  that  the  negative  charge  of  the 
electrons  will  be  exactly  balanced  by  the  positive 
charge of the protons.  
  Electrons  are  in  constant  motion  as  they  orbit 
around the nucleus of the atom. Electron orbits are 
organized  into  shells.  The  maximum  number  of 
electrons present in the first shell is 2, in the second 
shell 8, and in the third, fourth and fifth shells it is 
18, 32 and 50, respectively. In electronics, only the 
electron  shell  furthermost  from  the  nucleus  of  an 
atom  is  important.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 
movement of electrons only involves those present 
in the outer valence shell.
