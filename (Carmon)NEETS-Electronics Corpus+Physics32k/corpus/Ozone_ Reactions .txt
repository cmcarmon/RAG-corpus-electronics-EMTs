Ozone is among the most powerful oxidizing agents known, far stronger than O2. It is also unstable at high concentrations, decaying to ordinary diatomic oxygen. It has a varying half-life length, depending upon atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity, and air movement). In a sealed chamber with a fan that moves the gas, ozone has a half-life of approximately a day at room temperature. Some unverified claims imply that ozone can have a half life as short as a half an hour under atmospheric conditions.
2 O3 → 3 O2
This reaction proceeds more rapidly with increasing temperature and increased pressure. Deflagration of ozone can be triggered by a spark, and can occur in ozone concentrations of 10 wt% or higher.
Ozone can also be produced electrochemically at the anode of an electrochemical cell from oxygen. This reaction can be used to create smaller quantities of ozone for research purposes.
O3(g) + 2H+ + 2e− ←→ O2(g) + H2O E°= 2.075V
This reaction can be observed as an unwanted reaction in a Hoffman gas apparatus during the electrolysis of water when the voltage is set above the necessary voltage.
