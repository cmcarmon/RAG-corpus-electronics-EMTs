If S1 is closed, as shown in figure 3-31, view (B), the current will follow curve 1 as shown in figure 
3-32, view (A). The time required for the current to reach maximum depends on the size of L and RE. If 
RE is small, then the RL circuit has a long time constant. If only a small portion of curve 1 (C to D of 
view (A)) is used, then the current increase will have maximum change in a given time period. Further, 
the smaller the time increment the more nearly linear is the current rise. A constant current increase 
through the coil is a key factor in a blocking oscillator.
