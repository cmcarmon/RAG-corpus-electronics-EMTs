Exact analysis of resonant converters is complex due to the nonlinear loading on the resonant tanks.
The  rectiﬁer-ﬁlter-load  resistor  block  can  be  replaced  by  a  square-wave  voltage  source  [for  SRC,
Fig. 30.32(a)] or a square-wave current source [for PRC and SPRC, Fig. 30.32(b) and (c)]. Using fun-
damental components of the waveforms, an approximate analysis [Bhat, 1991; Steigerwald, 1988] using
a phasor circuit gives a reasonably good design approach. This analysis approach is illustrated next for
the SPRC.
