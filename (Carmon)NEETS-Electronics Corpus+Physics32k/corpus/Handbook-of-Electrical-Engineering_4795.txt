B-site: Analogous to the deﬁnition of the A-site.
Coercive ﬁeld: When  a  ferroelectric  material  is  cycled  through  the  hysteresis  loop  the  coercive  ﬁeld  is  the
electric  ﬁeld  value  at  which  the  polarization  is  zero. A  material  has  a  negative  and  a  positive  coercive
ﬁeld and these are usually, but not always, equal in magnitude to each other.
