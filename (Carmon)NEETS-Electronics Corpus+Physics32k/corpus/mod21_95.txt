 X. This loss is balanced by the calibrated resistor R S. Rather than calibrate this
control in terms of resistance, it is convenient to calibrate it in terms of the dissipation factor (the ratio of
the energy dissipated to the energy stored in a capacitor). The RS  control then provides the means for
completing the capacitance balance, and its dial reading indicates a loss figure for the capacitor under test.
