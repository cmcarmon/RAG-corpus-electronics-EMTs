electronic	circuit	simulation software can model 
electronic circuit performance and is a vital resource 
for checking circuit proper operation. Electronic circuit 
simulation software uses mathematical algorithms to 
duplicate the operation of electronic circuits. Due to 
its highly accurate modeling capability, many educa-
tional programs use simulation software for teaching 
electronics for various programs, including electronics 
engineering and electronic technology.
