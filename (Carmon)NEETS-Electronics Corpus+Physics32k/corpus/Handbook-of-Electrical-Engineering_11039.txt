Anesthesia  dramatically  alters  the  EEG  in  a  manner  that
depends  on  the  type  and  amount  of  anesthetic  given.  Despite
differences among anesthetic agents, some important similarities
accompany anesthesia. The ﬁrst change is replacement of the alpha
rhythm with low-voltage high-frequency activity that accompanies the analgesia and delirium stages. Thus the
EEG resembles that of an alert or excited subject, although the subject is not appropriately responsive to stimuli;
usually  the  response  is  excessive  and/or  inappropriate.  From  this  point  on,  the  type  of  EEG  obtained  with
deepening anesthesia depends on the type of anesthetic. However, when a deeper level of anesthesia is reached,
the EEG waveform becomes less dependent on the type of anesthetic. Large-amplitude low-frequency waves
begin to dominate the record, and with deepening anesthesia their frequency is reduced and they begin to occur
intermittently.  With  very  (dangerously)  deep  anesthesia,  the  record  is  ﬂat  (i.e.,  isoelectric).  Complicating
interpretation of the EEG in anesthesia are the effects of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and hypoglycemia, all of which
mimic deep anesthesia.
