Consider a cubic parcel of fluid with a density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, a height



d
z


{\displaystyle dz}
, and a surface area



d
A


{\displaystyle dA}
. The mass of the parcel can be expressed as,



m
=
ρ
⋅
d
A
⋅
d
z


{\displaystyle m=\rho \cdot dA\cdot dz}
. Using Newton's second law,



F
=
m
⋅
a


{\displaystyle F=m\cdot a}
, we can then examine a pressure difference



d
P


{\displaystyle dP}
(assumed to be only in the



z


{\displaystyle z}
-direction) to find the resulting force,



F
=
−
d
P
⋅
d
A
=
ρ
⋅
d
A
⋅
d
z
⋅
a


{\displaystyle F=-dP\cdot dA=\rho \cdot dA\cdot dz\cdot a}
.
The acceleration resulting from the pressure gradient is then,




a
=



−
1

ρ





d
P


d
z





{\displaystyle a={\frac {-1}{\rho }}{\frac {dP}{dz}}}
.
The effects of the pressure gradient are usually expressed in this way, in terms of an acceleration, instead of in terms of a force. We can express the acceleration more precisely, for a general pressure



P


{\displaystyle P}
as,







a
→



=



−
1

ρ





∇
→



P


{\displaystyle {\vec {a}}={\frac {-1}{\rho }}{\vec {\nabla }}P}
.
The direction of the resulting force (acceleration) is thus in the opposite direction of the most rapid increase of pressure.
