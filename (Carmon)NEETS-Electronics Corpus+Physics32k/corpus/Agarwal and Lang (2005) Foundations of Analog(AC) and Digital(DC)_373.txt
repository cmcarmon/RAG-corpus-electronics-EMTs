Section 1.6 introduced the voltage source and the current source as ideal mod-
els for energy sources. We call these independent sources because their values
are independent of circuit operation. But many sources have values that are
dependent on, that is, controlled by some other parameters in the system. For
example, the accelerator pedal in an automobile controls the power delivered
by the engine; the handle on a sink faucet controls the flow of water; and
