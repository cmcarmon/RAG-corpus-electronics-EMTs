In choosing a particular sensor for a given application, there are many factors to be considered. These deciding
factors or speciﬁcations can be divided into three major categories: environmental factors, economic factors,
and the sensor characteristics. The most commonly encountered factors are listed in Table 56.2, although not
all of these factors may be pertinent to a particular application. Most of the environmental factors determine
the packaging of the sensor, with packaging meaning the encapsulation or insulation which provides protection
and isolation and the input/output leads or connections and cabling. The economic factors determine the type
of manufacturing and materials used in the sensor and to some extent the quality of the materials (with respect
to lifetime). For example, a very expensive sensor may be cost effective if it is used repeatedly or for very long
periods of time. On the other hand, a disposable sensor, such as is desired in many medical applications, should
be inexpensive. The sensor characteristics of the sensor are usually the speciﬁcations of primary concern. The
Normally, a sensor is only useful if all
most important parameters are 
three  of  these  parameters  are  tightly  speciﬁed  for  a  given  range  of  measurand  and  time  of  operation.  For
example, a highly sensitive device is not useful if its output signal drifts greatly during the measurement time
and the data obtained is not reliable if the measurement is not repeatable. Other output characteristics, such
as selectivity and linearity, can often be compensated for by using additional, independent sensor input or with
signal conditioning circuits. In fact, most sensors have a response to temperature, since most tranducing effects
are temperature dependent.
