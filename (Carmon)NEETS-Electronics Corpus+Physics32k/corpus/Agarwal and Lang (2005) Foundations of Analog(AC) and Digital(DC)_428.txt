One choice of ground node and a corresponding set of node voltages is
defined in the figure. Node 3 is a good choice because it has three branches
and it connects directly to the voltage source. Since the independent voltage
source has a known voltage V, we can directly label the voltage of Node 1 as V
using the element law for an independent voltage source. Thus, we have one
unknown node voltage e. Because node voltages identically satisfy KVL, it is not
necessary to write KVL. To demonstrate this point, let us write KVL around
the loops. Doing so, we find
