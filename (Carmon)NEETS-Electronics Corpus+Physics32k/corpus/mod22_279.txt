In the early 1950s, mnemonic instruction codes and symbolic addresses were developed. This 
improved the program preparation process by substituting letter symbols (mnemonic codes) for basic 
machine language instruction codes. Each computer has mnemonic codes, although the symbols vary 
among the different makes and models of computers. The computer still uses machine language in actual 
processing, but it translates the symbolic language into machine language equivalent. Symbolic languages 
have many advantages over machine language coding. Less time is required to write a program. Detail is 
reduced. Fewer errors are made. Errors which are made are easier to find, and programs are easier to 
modify.
