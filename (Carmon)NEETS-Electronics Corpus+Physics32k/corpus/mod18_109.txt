The indicator uses the received signals routed from the radar receiver to produce a visual indication
of target information. The cathode-ray oscilloscope is an ideal instrument for the presentation of radar
data. This is because it not only shows a variation of a single quantity, such as voltage, but also gives an
indication of the relative values of two or more quantities. The sweep frequency of the radar indicator is
determined by the pulse-repetition frequency of the radar system. Sweep duration is determined by the
setting of the range-selector switch. Since the indicator is so similar to an oscilloscope, the term RADAR
SCOPE is commonly used when referring to radar indicators.
