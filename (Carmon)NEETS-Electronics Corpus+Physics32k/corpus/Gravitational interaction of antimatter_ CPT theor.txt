The CPT theorem implies that the difference between the properties of a matter particle and those of its antimatter counterpart is completely described by C-inversion. Since this C-inversion doesn't affect gravitational mass, the CPT theorem predicts that the gravitational mass of antimatter is the same as that of ordinary matter. A repulsive gravity is then excluded, since that would imply a difference in sign between the observable gravitational mass of matter and antimatter.
