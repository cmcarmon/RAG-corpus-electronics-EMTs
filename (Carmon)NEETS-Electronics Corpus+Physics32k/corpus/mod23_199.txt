The first arrangement, figure 4-13A, shows a single capstan design. In this method, two tightly 
wound tape reels, without flanges, are pushed against the capstan. As the capstan turns, it forces the tape 
reels to turn in the appropriate direction. Magnetic tape tension is maintained by using either spring 
loading or servo control.
