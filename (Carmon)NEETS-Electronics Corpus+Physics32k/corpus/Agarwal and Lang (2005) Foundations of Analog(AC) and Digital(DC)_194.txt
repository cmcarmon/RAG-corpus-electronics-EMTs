In some fields of engineering, there are two obvious sources of power that
appear to have dual properties. Think, for example, of air pumps. For an
ordinary tire pump, the higher the air pressure, the harder the person at the
pump-handle has to work. But with a household vacuum cleaner, also an air
pump of sorts, you can hear the motor actually speed up if the air flow out of
the machine is blocked, and a measurement of motor current would confirm
that the power to the motor goes down under these conditions.
