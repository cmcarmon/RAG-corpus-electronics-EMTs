The number of active users in a local network is an important
parameter that affects the bound of the performance. Under-
standing the bounds of the performance would help to deter-
mine the size of a LAN. The stability of a LAN can be at the state
of either low delay, where the capacity is greater than the offered
load; of high delay, where more time is spent on controlling
access to network, and little time is spent on actual data trans-
mission; or the unbound delay, where the offered load is greater
than the capacity. The state of the unbound delay must be
avoided in the design. In general, delay is bounded by the
number of users (N) multiplied by the transmission time of
Tmsg. The throughput is bounded by N/(Tidle Ã¾ N Tmsg),
where the Tidle is the mean idle time. The number of active
stations can be determined by the following equation:
