consumes  minimal  operating  current  (120  mA) 
typical for an 18 V supply). Note that, by virtue of 
the  low-power  CMOS  technology  employed,  the 
device does not have the same output current drive 
as  that  possessed  by  its  standard  counterparts.  It 
can, however supply up to two standard TTL loads. 
 
Dual 555 timer (e.g. NE556A) 
 
This  is  a  dual  version  of  the  standard  555  timer 
housed in a 14-pin DIL package. The two devices 
may  be  used  entirely  independently  and  share  the 
same electrical characteristics as the standard 555.  
 
Low-power (CMOS) dual 555 (e.g. ICM75561PA) 
 
This is a dual version of the low-power CMOS 555 
timer contained in a 14-pin DIL package. The two 
devices  may  again  be  used  entirely  independently 
and share the same electrical characteristics as the 
low-power CMOS 555.  
  Pin connecting details for the above devices can 
be found in Appendix 4.
