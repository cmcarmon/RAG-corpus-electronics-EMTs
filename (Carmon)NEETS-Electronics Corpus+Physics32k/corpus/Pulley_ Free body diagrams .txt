The mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analyzed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load. In an ideal system, the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear. In this case, a force balance on a free body that includes the load, W, and n supporting sections of a rope with tension T, yields:




n
T
âˆ’
W
=
0.


{\displaystyle nT-W=0.}

The ratio of the load to the input tension force is the mechanical advantage MA of the pulley system,

{\displaystyle MA={\frac {W}{T}}=n.}

Thus, the mechanical advantage of the system is equal to the number of sections of rope supporting the load.
