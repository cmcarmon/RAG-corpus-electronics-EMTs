1. Direct duty cycle control is the simplest control method. A ﬁxed-frequency ramp is compared with the
control voltage [Fig. 30.19(a)] to obtain a variable duty cycle base drive signal for the transistor. This is
the simplest method of control. Disadvantages of this method are (a) provides no voltage feedforward
to anticipate the effects of input voltage changes, slow response to sudden input changes, poor audio
susceptibility, poor open-loop line regulation, requiring higher loop gain to achieve speciﬁcations; (b)
poor dynamic response.
