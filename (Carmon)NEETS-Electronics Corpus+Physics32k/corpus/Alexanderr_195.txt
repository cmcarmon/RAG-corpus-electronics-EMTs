The simplest approach is to excite the circuit with either a
1-V voltage source or a 1-A current source. Since we will end
up with an equivalent resistance (either positive or negative), I
prefer to use the current source and nodal analysis which will
yield a voltage at the output terminals equal to the resistance
(with 1 A ï¬‚owing in, 
resistance).
