Gradual "dehydration melting"—leakage of water stored in hydrate minerals of Earth's rocks—could have formed a portion of its water. Water may also have come from volcanism: water vapor in the atmosphere that originated in volcanic eruptions may have condensed to form rain, slowly filling Earth's oceanic basins.
