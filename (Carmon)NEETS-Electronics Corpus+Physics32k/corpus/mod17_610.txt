Lasers can be either cw or pulsed. Actually, lasers are little different from conventional oscillators. 
However, the way lasers convert energy from one form to another is quite different. In conventional 
oscillators, dc power from the collector is converted to rf energy. The frequency is for the most part 
independent of the molecular or atomic structure of the generator. This is not true for the laser. Laser 
conversion takes place directly within the molecular structure of a crystal or gas. The external circuits 
have little effect on actual output frequency. The fact that the light from an LED is always the same color 
results from similar conditions. In a laser, incoherent light excites the electrons in the atoms to higher 
energy levels than they normally would have. The new energy states are unstable and the electrons drop 
down to lower energy levels. Energy is then released in the form of light.
