Figure 3.1 portrays the speech system anatomy midway
through the human upper torso as viewed from the left. The
gross components of the system are the lungs, trachea (‘‘wind-
pipe’’), larynx (organ of voice production), pharyngeal cavity
(throat), oral (or buccal) cavity (mouth), and nasal cavity
(nose). In technical discussions, the pharyngeal and oral cav-
ities are grouped into one unit referred to as the vocal tract
and the nasal cavity is often called the nasal tract2. Accord-
ingly, the vocal tract begins at the output of the larynx and
terminates at the input to the lips. The nasal tract begins at the
velum and ends at the nostrils of the nose. Finer anatomical
features that are critical to speech production include the vocal
folds or vocal cords, soft palate or velum, tongue, teeth and
lips. The uvula is the soft tip of the velum that hangs down in
the back of the oral cavity. The glottis is the name given to the
opening between the vocal folds, and the adjective glottal is
frequently used to refer to laryngeal or vocal phenomena (e.g.,
‘‘glottal waveform’’). These ﬁner anatomical components move
to different positions to produce various speech sounds and
are known as articulators by speech scientists. The mandible
(jaw) is also considered to be an articulator because it is
responsible for both gross and ﬁne movements that affect the
size and shape of the vocal tract as well as the positions of the
other articulators.
