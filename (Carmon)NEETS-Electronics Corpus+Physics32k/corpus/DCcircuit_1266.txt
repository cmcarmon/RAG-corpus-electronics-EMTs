When mathematics students ﬁrst study calculus, they begin by exploring the concept of
rates of change for various mathematical functions. The derivative, which is the ﬁrst and most
elementary calculus principle, is an expression of one variable’s rate of change in terms of
another. Calculus students have to learn this principle while studying abstract equations. You
get to learn this principle while studying something you can relate to: electric circuits!
