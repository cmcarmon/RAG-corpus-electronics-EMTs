An accelerometer is a device that gives an indication, usually in the form of a voltage, that is 
proportional to the acceleration to which it is subjected. The operation of an accelerometer is based on the 
property of INERTIA (Newton's First Law of Motion). A simple demonstration of inertia happens to us 
almost every day. You know that if your automobile is subjected to acceleration in a forward direction, 
you are forced back in the seat. If your auto comes to a sudden stop, you are drawn forward. When your
