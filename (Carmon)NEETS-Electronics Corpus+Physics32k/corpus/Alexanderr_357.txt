Rather  than  going  through  the  derivations  above,  there  is  a  sys-
tematic  approach—or  rather,  a  short-cut  method—for  ﬁnding  the  step
response of an RC or RL circuit. Let us reexamine Eq. (7.45), which is
more general than Eq. (7.48). It is evident that 
has two components.
Classically  there  are  two  ways  of  decomposing  this  into  two  compo-
nents.  The  ﬁrst  is  to  break  it  into  a  “natural  response  and  a  forced
response’’ and the second is to break it into a “transient response and
a steady-state response.’’ Starting with the natural response and forced
response, we write the total or complete response as
