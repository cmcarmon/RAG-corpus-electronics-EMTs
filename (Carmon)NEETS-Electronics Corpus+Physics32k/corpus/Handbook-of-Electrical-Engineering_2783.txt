Distributed RC Model: If the line is sufﬁciently long, the signal sees a decreasing resistance and capacitance
toward the destination as the signal traverses the line. To represent this changing RC, the distributed RC
model divides the overall line into shorter segments, each of which can be represented by the lumped
RC model above. The transfer function of the overall line is then the product of the transfer functions
of  the  sections.  The  propagation  delay  is  negligible,  though  the  rise/fall  times  increase  as  the  signal
propagates toward the far-end gates (signiﬁcant if the line is tapped along its length to drive multiple
gates).
