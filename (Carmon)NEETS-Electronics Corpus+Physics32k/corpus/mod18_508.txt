the electronics dry-air branch is to provide several electronic equipments with air that is dry enough for 
proper operation. Microwave components, such as waveguides, cavities, and power amplifiers, require 
dry air to prevent arcing and internal corrosion. The electronics dry-air branch must satisfy the dry-air 
requirements of the electronic user equipment. Dry air of less than the required specifications will degrade 
equipment performance. It may also incur major repairs, overhaul, or replacement of expensive electronic 
components.
