Sensors  provide  us  with  a  means  of  generating 
signals  that  can  be  used  as  inputs  to  electronic 
circuits.  The  things  that  we  might  want  to  sense 
include  physical  parameters  such  as  temperature, 
light level, and pressure. Being able to generate an 
electrical  signal  that  accurately  represents  these 
quantities allows us not only to measure and record 
these  values  but 
them.  
  Sensors are, in fact, a subset of a larger family of 
devices known as transducers so we will consider 
these  before  we  look  at  sensors  and  how  we 
condition  the  signals  that  they  produce  in  greater 
detail.  We  begin,  however,  with  a  brief 
introduction  to  the  instrumentation  and    control 
systems  in  which  sensors,  transducers,  and  signal 
conditioning circuits are used.
