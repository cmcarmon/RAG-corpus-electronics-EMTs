Inductors are used primarily in tuned circuits, to select or reject signals of 
specific frequencies, and to block (or choke) high‐frequency signals, such 
as eliminating radio frequency (RF) interference in cable transmissions. In 
audio applications, inductors are also commonly used to remove the 60 Hz 
hum known as noise (often created by nearby power lines). Here’s a list that 
explains some of the amazing things a simple coil of wire can do:
