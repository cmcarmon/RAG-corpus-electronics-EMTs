: A D/A conversion process where the output signal is the product of a digital code multiplied
times an analog input reference signal. This allows the analog reference signal to be scaled by a digital code.
: A/D converters that sample analog signals that have a maximum frequency that is
less than the Nyquist frequency. The Nyquist frequency is deÔ¨Åned as one-half of the sampling frequency.

If  a  signal  has  frequencies  above  the  Nyquist  frequency,  a  distortion  called 
aliasing, an
