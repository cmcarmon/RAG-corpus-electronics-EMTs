Details  on  the  construction  of  maximum  entropy  models,  techniques  for  the  selection  of  features  to  be
included in models and the computations of the parameters of these models are addressed in [34]. Techniques
for computing the parameters of such models such as, hill climbing, iterative projection and iterative scaling
algorithms are described in [25].
