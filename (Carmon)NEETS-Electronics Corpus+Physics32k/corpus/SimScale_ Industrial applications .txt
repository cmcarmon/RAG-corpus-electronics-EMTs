SimScale's CAE software finds application in a wide range of industries — such as HVAC, wind engineering, automotive, aerospace, electronics, industrial equipment and machinery, heat sinks, consumer products, biomechanics etc. Its use cases are very diverse. Japan-based Tokyowheel — a company that engineers technical carbon fiber racing wheels for competitive cyclists — used SimScale's CFD software component to determine the most aerodynamic wheel profile. QRC Technologies performed thermal simulations on SimScale to test multiple variations of their RF tester. Carlsson Autotechnik optimized the aerodynamics of their vehicle with the help SimScale's CFD module. Malaika, a company specialized in designing and producing car seats, employed SimScale's FEA simulation functionality to design safer car seats for children.
