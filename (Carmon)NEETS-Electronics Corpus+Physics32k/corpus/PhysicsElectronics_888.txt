It is possible to digitize relatively long time intervals by incrementing a counter with a
repetitive signal derived from an oscillator. For short time intervals the time-to-digital
converter (TDC) circuit shown in ﬁgure 8.8 can be used.
The resulting voltage on the capacitor is proportional to the time between the START and
STOP pulses as shown in ﬁgure 8.9.
