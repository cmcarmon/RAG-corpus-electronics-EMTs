The astronomical unit of length is now defined as exactly 149 597 870 700 meters. It is approximately equal to the mean Earth–Sun distance. It was formerly defined as that length for which the Gaussian gravitational constant (k) takes the value 0.01720209895 when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time. The dimensions of k2 are those of the constant of gravitation (G), i.e., L3M−1T−2. The term “unit distance” is also used for the length A while, in general usage, it is usually referred to simply as the “astronomical unit”, symbol au or ua.
An equivalent formulation of the old definition of the astronomical unit is the radius of an unperturbed circular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with a mean motion of 0.01720209895 radians per day. The speed of light in IAU is the defined value c0 = 299792458 m/s of the SI units. In terms of this speed, the old definition of the astronomical unit of length had the accepted value: 1 ua = c0τA = 1.49597870700×1011 ± 3 m, where τA is the transit time of light across the astronomical unit. The astronomical unit of length was determined by the condition that the measured data in the ephemeris match observations, and that in turn decides the transit time τA.
