Philippine Standard Time (Filipino: Pamantayang Oras ng Pilipinas, abbreviated PST or PhST), also known as Philippine Time (PHT) and informally Juan Time, is the official name for the time in the Philippines. The country only uses one time zone (UTC+08:00), and for a short period, it also used daylight saving time.
