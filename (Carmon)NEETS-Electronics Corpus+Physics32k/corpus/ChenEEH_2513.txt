can yield high capacitances. The tolerance of interdigital ca-
pacitors can be well controlled, and they are ideal for tuning,
coupling, and matching element design where a small capaci-
tance and a high precision are required. The Q-factors for the
MIM and interdigital capacitors are mainly limited by insula-
tor dielectric loss and ohmic effects of the Ô¨Ångers. Figure 7.8
illustrates some typical lumped element values for the inter-
digital capacitor (Zhu and Wu, 2000).
