Figure 3-31 shows a photodiode with its schematic symbol. The arrows pointing toward the symbol 
indicate that light is required for operation of the device. A light source is aimed at the photodiode 
through a transparent "window" placed over the semiconductor chip. Switching the light source on or off 
changes the conduction level of the photodiode. Varying the light intensity controls the amount of 
conduction. Because photodiodes respond quickly to changes in light intensity, they are extremely useful 
in digital applications such as computer card readers, paper tape readers, and photographic light meters. 
They are also used in some types of optical scanning equipment.
