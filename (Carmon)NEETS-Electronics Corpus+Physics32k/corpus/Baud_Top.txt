In telecommunication and electronics, baud (; symbol: Bd) is a common measure of the speed of communication over a data channel. Technically speaking, it is the unit for symbol rate or modulation rate in symbols per second or pulses per second. It is the number of distinct symbol changes (signaling events) made to the transmission medium per second in a digitally modulated signal or a line code.
Baud was the prevalent measure for data transmission speed until replaced by the term bps (bits per second), to which it closely approximates.
Baud is related to gross bit rate or symbol rate expressed as bits per second.
