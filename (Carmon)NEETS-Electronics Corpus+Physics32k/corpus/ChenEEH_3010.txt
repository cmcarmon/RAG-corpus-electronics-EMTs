The slot antenna, consisting of a narrow slit in a ground plane,
is a very versatile antenna. With modiﬁcation, it is amenable to
waveguide, coplanar waveguide (CPW), coaxial, slot line, or
microstrip feeding schemes and has been used in all aspects
of wireless and radar applications. The planar form of the
slot antenna with CPW feeding is shown in Figure 11.18.
Unlike the waveguide slot antenna that is excited from one
side, the planar slot antenna demonstrates bidirectional radi-
ation, which limits the application of this antenna. Alterna-
tively, the slot may be either cavity- or reﬂector-backed to
eliminate backside radiation at the cost of additional bulk
and complexity.
