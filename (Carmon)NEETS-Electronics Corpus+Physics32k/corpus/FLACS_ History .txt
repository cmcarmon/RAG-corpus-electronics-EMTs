FLACS software development started in-house in the early 1980s under the sponsorship program, Gas Explosion Safety (GSP), funded by the oil companies BP, Elf Aquitaine, Esso, Mobil, Norsk Hydro and Statoil. FLACS-86 was released to GSP sponsors in 1986. Continuous research and development from then onwards resulted in many commercial releases. In 2006, FLACS v8.1 was released to customers. Till then FLACS was developed for Unix and Linux platforms. In 2008, however, FLACS v9.0 was released for Microsoft Windows platform. FLACS v9.1 and FLACS-Wind was developed in 2010. A fully parallelized FLACSv10.0 (using OpenMP) with a new solver for incompressible flows was released in 2012. FLACSv10.0 also constitutes a Homogeneous Equilibrium Model (HEM) for two-phase flow calculations.
