To obtain a data sequence that is exactly representable by a  qth-order exponential model, we continue this
iterative  process  in  an  obvious  manner.  In  particular,  one  sequentially  computes  the  data  matrices  Xk+1  =
PTP(q)(Xk)  for  k  =  0,  1,  2,  .  .  .  until  the  rank  of  data  matrix  Xk  +  1  is  deemed  sufÔ¨Åciently  close  to  q.  Since  the
projection operator P(q) and PT are each closed, we are assured that this iterative process will eventually converge
to a Toeplitz-structured data matrix of rank q. It has been empirically determined that the algorithmic process
converges in a rapid fashion and typically takes from three to ten iterations for small-dimensioned matrices.
Furthermore, the resulting enhanced data matrix has data elements that generally provide a better representation
of the underlying signal components than did the original data. The restoration process has therefore effectively
stripped away noise that contaminates the original data. We will now examine a special case of data restoration
that has important practical applications.
