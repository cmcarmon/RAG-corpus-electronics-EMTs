Figure 3-33 illustrates the schematic symbols for the various types of phototransistors. 
Phototransistors may be of the two-terminal type, in which the light intensity on the photodiode alone 
determines the amount of conduction. They may also be of the three-terminal type, which have an added 
base lead that allows an electrical bias to be applied to the base. The bias allows an optimum transistor 
conduction level, and thus compensates for ambient (normal room) light intensity.
