The next decade should see the emergence of several multi-tonne mass direct detection experiments, which will probe WIMP-nucleus cross sections orders of magnitude smaller than the current state-of-the-art sensitivity. Examples of such next-generation experiments are LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), which will start as a several tonne mass liquid xenon experiment before moving up to twenty tonnes, and DARWIN, another proposed liquid xenon direct detection experiment which will have a target mass approaching twenty tonnes.
Such multi-tonne experiments will also face a new background in the form of neutrinos, which will limit their ability to probe the WIMP parameter space beyond a certain point, known as the neutrino floor. However although its name may imply a hard limit, the neutrino floor represents the region of parameter space beyond which experimental sensitivity can only improve at best as the inverse square root of exposure (the product of detector mass and running time). For WIMP masses below 10 GeV the dominant source of neutrino background is from the sun, while for higher masses the background contains contributions from atmospheric neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background.
