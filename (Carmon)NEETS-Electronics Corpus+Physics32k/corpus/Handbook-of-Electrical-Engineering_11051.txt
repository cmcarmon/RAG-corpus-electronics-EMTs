Figure 113.24 shows the motor pathways from the motor cortex to a typical muscle. The cortical motor areas
are represented by Penﬁeld’s homunculus. A train of 250 stimuli were applied between electrodes on the scalp
and  in  the  mouth.  The  motor-evoked  potentials  were  recorded  with  skin-surface  electrodes  over  the  spinal
column. The MEP of a patient in whom the muscles were paralyzed is also shown in Fig. 113.24. Because the
muscles were paralyzed, the MEPs shown in the ﬁgure represent action potentials in the spinal cord. Note the
prominent peaks at 7 and 14 ms. These peaks provide information on the path taken by the nerve impulses
initiated in the motor cortex.
