The first case is when natural convection aids forced convection. This is seen when the buoyant motion is in the same direction as the forced motion, thus enhancing the heat transfer. An example of this would be a fan blowing upward on a hot plate. Since heat naturally rises, the air being forced upward over the plate adds to the heat transfer.
