Multi-range meters 
 
For practical measurements on electronic circuits it 
is often  convenient  to  combine  the  functions  of  a 
voltmeter,  ammeter  and  ohmmeter  into  a  single 
instrument  (known  as  a  multi-range  meter  or 
simply 
conventional 
multimeter  as  many  as  eight  or  nine  measuring 
functions may be provided with up to six or eight 
ranges  for  each  measuring  function.  Besides  the 
normal  voltage,  current  and  resistance  functions, 
some  meters  also  include  facilities  for  checking 
transistors and measuring capacitance. Most multi-
range  meters  normally  operate  from 
internal 
batteries  and  thus  they  are  independent  of  the 
mains  supply.  This  leads  to  a  high  degree  of 
portability  which  can  be  all-important  when 
measurements  are  to  be  made  away  from  a 
laboratory or workshop.
