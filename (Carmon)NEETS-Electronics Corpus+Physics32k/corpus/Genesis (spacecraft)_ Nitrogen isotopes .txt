Nitrogen was a key target element because the extent and origin of its isotopic variations in Solar System materials remain unknown. Target material showed that implanted solar wind nitrogen has a 15N/14N ratio of 2.18 × 10−3 (that is, ≈40% poorer in 15N relative to terrestrial atmosphere). The 15N/14N ratio of the protosolar nebula was 2.27 × 10−3, which is the lowest 15N/14N ratio known for Solar System objects. This result demonstrates the extreme nitrogen isotopic heterogeneity of the nascent Solar System and accounts for the 15N-depleted components observed in Solar System reservoirs.
