and V2. Show that the conservation of power is
satisﬁed by the circuit.
*1.3.6 The current sources in Figure P1.3.6 are given to
be IA = 30 A and IB = 50 A. For the values of
R1 = 20 , R2 = 40 , and R3 = 80 , ﬁnd:
(a) The voltage V.
(b) The currents I1, I2, and I3.
(c) The power supplied by the current sources
and check whether conservation of power is
satisﬁed.
