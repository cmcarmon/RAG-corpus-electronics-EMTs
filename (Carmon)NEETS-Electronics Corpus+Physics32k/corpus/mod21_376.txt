Of considerable importance in the measurements of frequency or wavelength are the standards 
against which frequency-measuring devices are compared and calibrated. Frequency standards belong to 
two general categories: primary and secondary standards. The PRIMARY FREQUENCY STANDARD 
maintained by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards has long-term stability and an accuracy of 1 part in 
1012, using an atomic clock. A SECONDARY FREQUENCY STANDARD is a highly stable and 
accurate standard that has been calibrated against the primary standard. Secondary standards are 
maintained by calibration laboratories that service your test equipment.
