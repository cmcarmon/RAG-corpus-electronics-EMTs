CK Vulpeculae (also Nova Vulpeculae 1670) may be the oldest cataloged nova variable. It consists of a central dim object with gas flowing out (~ 210 kilometres per second) into a bi-polar nebulous blob. It is either inside of a cloud of cold (~ 15 K) dust or the cloud is in front of it from the Earth's perspective. Molecular gas in the vicinity is rich in nitrogen relative to oxygen. Models suggest CK Vulpeculae may not be a classic nova; rather it may be classified as a Luminous red nova which is the result of two main sequence stars colliding and merging.
