The simplest modes of operation for this register are the parallel inputs and outputs. Parallel data is
applied to the SET inputs of the FFs and results in either a 1 or 0 output, depending on the input. The
outputs of the FFs may be sampled for parallel output. In this mode, the register functions just like the
parallel register covered earlier in this section.
