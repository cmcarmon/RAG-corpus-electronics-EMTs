Bedside Terminals/Point-of-Care Systems
Patient information is generated on an ongoing basis, wherever the patient may be. Almost two decades ago
with the creation of the Ô¨Årst programmable calculators, a trend started in terms of calculating hemodynamic
variables in the OR, etc. This approach was improved with the creation of personal computers, ending with
the  development  of  what  are  now  called  bedside  terminals.  Companies  such  as  Clinicom,  Emtek,  Hewlett-
Packard,  Hospitronics,  and  Spacelabs  offer  systems  that  can  go  from  doing  simply  patient  monitoring,  to  a
complete data acquisition, data management, and data analysis system that incorporates in some cases diagnosis
and treatment therapy.
