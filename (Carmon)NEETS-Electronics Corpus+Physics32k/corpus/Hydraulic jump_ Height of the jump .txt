The height of the jump is derived from the application of the equations of conservation of mass and momentum. There are several methods of predicting the height of a hydraulic jump.
They all reach common conclusions that:
The ratio of the water depth before and after the jump depend solely on the ratio of velocity of the water entering the jump to the speed of the wave over-running the moving water.
The height of the jump can be many times the initial depth of the water.
For a known flow rate

,


{\displaystyle q,}
as shown by the figure below, the approximation that the momentum flux is the same just up- and downstream of the energy principle yields an expression of the energy loss in the hydraulic jump. Hydraulic jumps are commonly used as energy dissipators downstream of dam spillways.

Applying the continuity principle
In fluid dynamics, the equation of continuity is effectively an equation of conservation of mass. Considering any fixed closed surface within an incompressible moving fluid, the fluid flows into a given volume at some points and flows out at other points along the surface with no net change in mass within the space since the density is constant. In case of a rectangular channel, then the equality of mass flux upstream (



ρ

v

0



h

0




{\displaystyle \rho v_{0}h_{0}}
) and downstream (



ρ

v

1



h

1




{\displaystyle \rho v_{1}h_{1}}
) gives:

or

{\displaystyle v_{1}=v_{0}{h_{0} \over h_{1}},}

with

and

{\displaystyle v_{1}}
the depth-averaged flow velocities upstream and downstream, and




h

{\displaystyle h_{0}}
and




h

{\displaystyle h_{1}}
the corresponding water depths.
Conservation of momentum flux
For a straight prismatic rectangular channel, the conservation of momentum flux across the jump, assuming constant density, can be expressed as:

{\displaystyle \rho v_{0}^{2}h_{0}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_{0}^{2}=\rho v_{1}^{2}h_{1}+{1 \over 2}\rho gh_{1}^{2}.}

In rectangular channel, such conservation equation can be further simplified to dimensionless M-y equation form, which is widely used in hydraulic jump analysis in open channel flow.

{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}={\frac {{\sqrt {1+{8Fr^{2}}}}-1}{2}},}

This produces three solution classes:
When

{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}=1}
, then






h

h

{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}=1}
(i.e., there is no jump)
When






v

g

h

<

{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}<1}
, then






h

1



h

<
1


{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}<1}
(i.e., there is a negative jump – this can be shown as not conserving energy and is only physically possible if some force were to accelerate the fluid at that point)
When






v

0


2



g

h

0





>
1


{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{0}^{2}}{gh_{0}}}>1}
, then






h

1



h

0




>
1


{\displaystyle {h_{1} \over h_{0}}>1}
(i.e., there is a positive jump)
This is equivalent to the condition that




F
r
>
1


{\displaystyle \ Fr>1}
. Since the






g

h

0






{\displaystyle \ {\sqrt {gh_{0}}}}
is the speed of a shallow gravity wave, the condition that



F
r
>
1


{\displaystyle Fr>1}
is equivalent to stating that the initial velocity represents supercritical flow (Froude number > 1) while the final velocity represents subcritical flow (Froude number < 1).
Undulations downstream of the jump
Practically this means that water accelerated by large drops can create stronger standing waves (undular bores) in the form of hydraulic jumps as it decelerates at the base of the drop. Such standing waves, when found downstream of a weir or natural rock ledge, can form an extremely dangerous "keeper" with a water wall that "keeps" floating objects (e.g., logs, kayaks, or kayakers) recirculating in the standing wave for extended periods.
