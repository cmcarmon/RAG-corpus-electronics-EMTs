 is when
one  computer  directly  dials  up  another.  As  phone  lines  in  and  out  of  locations  began  to  become “busy”  at
 idea was born. This allows an electronic cue system where computers may line up to
times, the 
access the next available line when one computer is done. Various forms of multiplexing have been developed
to  hold  the  data  to  be  transmitted  until  an  outgoing  line  is  available,  then  delivering  it.  This  eliminates  the
need for the entire computer waiting for a path. Other tasks can be undertaken while the outgoing data is in
the hold position.
