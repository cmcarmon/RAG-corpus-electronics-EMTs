When the voltage drop across the plates is equal to the battery voltage, the 
capacitor is said to be fully charged. (Itâ€™s really the capacitor plates that are 
charged; the capacitor as a whole has no net charge.) Even if the battery 
remains connected, the capacitor will no longer charge because there is no 
voltage differential between the battery and the capacitor. If you remove the 
battery from the circuit, current will not flow and the charge will remain on 
the capacitor plates. The capacitor looks like a voltage source, as it holds the 
charge, storing electrical energy.
