Magnetic fields interact with an electron in a manner that alters velocity independently of kinetic energy (velocity magnitude). Electrons move according to the cross product of the magnetic field and the electron propagation vector, such that, in an infinite uniform field moving electrons take a circular motion at a constant radius dependent upon electron velocity and field strength according to the following equation, which can be derived from circular motion:




r

m

v


e

{\displaystyle r={\frac {2mcv}{eH}}}

where r is the orbit radius, m is the mass of an electron, v is the electron velocity, e is the charge on the electron and H is the applied magnetic field. Electrons that have a velocity component that is parallel to the magnetic field will rather "stretch out" the circle and form helical paths, the pitch of which is subject to the rotation period and the parallel velocity component.
In the case of an applied electrostatic field, an electron will deflect towards the positive gradient of the field. Notably, this crossing of electrostatic field lines means that electrons, as they move through electrostatic fields change the magnitude of their velocity, whereas in magnetic fields, only the velocity direction is modified.
As electrons can exhibit non-particle (wave-like) effects such as diffraction, a full analysis of electron paths can be obtained by solving Maxwell's equationâ€”however in many situations, the particle interpretation may provide a sufficient approximation with great reduction in complexity.
One further property of electrons is that they interact strongly with matter as they are sensitive to not only the nucleus, but also the matter's electron charge cloud. Therefore, electrons require vacuum to propagate any reasonable distance, such as would be desirable in electron optic system.
Penetration in vacuum is dictated by mean free path, a measure of the probability of collision between electrons and matter, approximate values for which can be derived from Poisson statistics.
