Instructions and data are separated. 
Software design is linear, e.g., it progresses from design through 
coding and testing. This means change is difÔ¨Åcult to 
accommodate.
Programs are top-down decompositions of procedures, e.g., 
trees.
Program components are the real world, thus making 
programming more of a magic art.
