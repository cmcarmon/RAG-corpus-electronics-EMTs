rely on the linear region of
the element’s characteristic
(logic gates and arithmetic circuits) to designs that rely on
the element’s nonlinear behavior (ﬂip-ﬂops, static memory
cells, and Schmitt triggers). A circuit symbol of the bipolar
junction transistor and its simpliﬁed characteristics are shown
in Figure 5.2. The large-signal behavior of a bipolar junction
transistor is usually speciﬁed graphically by a pair of graphs
with families of curves. A variety of ﬁeld-effect transistors
(the most popular being a metal-oxide semiconductor) are
voltage-controlled nonlinear elements used in a similar design
fashion as the bipolar junction transistors (Massobrio and
Antognetti, 1993).
