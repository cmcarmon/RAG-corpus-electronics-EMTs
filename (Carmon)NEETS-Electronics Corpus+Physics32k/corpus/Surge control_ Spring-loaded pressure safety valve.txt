Spring-loaded pressure safety valves use a compressed spring to hold the valve closed. The valve will remain closed until the process pressure exceeds the set point of the spring pressure. The valve will open 100% when the set point is reached and will remain open until a certain blow down factor is reached. Oftentimes the blow down is a percentage of the set point, such as 20% of the set point. That means that the valve will remain open until the process pressure decreases to 20% below the set point of the spring-loaded relief valve.
Advantages:
1) Opens 100% when set point is reached.
2) Easy to install and maintain.
3) High flow capacity or Cv value in gas service.
Disadvantages:
1) Has a blow down factor inherent to the design of the valve.
2) The spring takes a set, making the set point drift over time.
3) May release product to atmosphere.
