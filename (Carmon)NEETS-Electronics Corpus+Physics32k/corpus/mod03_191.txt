The use of the jacks will be discussed first. The COMMON or -jack is used in all functions is
plugged into the COMMON jack. The +jack is used for the second meter lead for any of the functions
printed in large letters beside the FUNCTION SWITCH (the large switch in the center). The other jacks
have specific functions printed above or below them and are self-explanatory (the output jack is used with
the dB scale, which will not be explained in this chapter). To use one of the special function jacks, except
+10 amps, one lead is plugged into the COMMON jack, and the FUNCTION SWITCH is positioned to
point to the special function (small letters). For example, to measure a very small current (20
microamperes), one meter lead would be plugged into the COMMON jack, the other meter lead would be
plugged into the 50A AMPS jack, and the FUNCTION SWITCH would be placed in the 50V/IA AMPS
position. To measure currents above 500 milliamperes, the +10A and - 10A jacks would be used on the
meter with one exception. One meter lead and the FUNCTION SWITCH would be placed in the
10MA/AMPS position.
