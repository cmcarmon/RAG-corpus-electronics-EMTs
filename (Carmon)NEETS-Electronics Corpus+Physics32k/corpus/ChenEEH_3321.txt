By using the constant matrices B and B in equation 7.60, the
time taken for evaluating one iteration for the fast decoupled
algorithm is considerably less than that of
the Newton-
Raphson algorithm. In repeated power ﬂow runs of the same
power system, the inverses of the matrices B and B can directly
be stored, which enables the implementation to be very fast.
However, the convergence speed of the fast decoupled algo-
rithm is not quadratic, and it takes considerably more iter-
ations to converge to an accurate power ﬂow solution. Fast
decoupled algorithm is used in applications where quick
approximate estimates of power ﬂow solutions are required.
