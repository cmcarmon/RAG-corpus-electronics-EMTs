AC electric motors can be run in fixed-speed operation determined by the number of stator pole pairs in the motor and the frequency of the alternating current supply. AC motors can be made for "pole changing" operation, reconnecting the stator winding to vary the number of poles so that two, sometimes three, speeds are obtained. For example a machine with 8 physical pairs of poles, could be connected to allow running with either 4 or 8 pole pairs, giving two speeds - at 60 Hz, these would be 1800 RPM and 900 RPM. If speed changes are rare, the motor may be initially connected for one speed then re-wired for the other speed as process conditions change, or, magnetic contactors can be used to switch between the two speeds as process needs fluctuate. Connections for more than three speeds are uneconomic.
The number of such fixed-speed-operation speeds is constrained by cost as number of pole pairs increases. If many different speeds or continuously variable speeds are required, other methods are required.
Direct-current motors allow for changes of speed by adjusting the shunt field current. Another way of changing speed of a direct current motor is to change the voltage applied to the armature.
An adjustable speed drive might consist of an electric motor and controller that is used to adjust the motor's operating speed. The combination of a constant-speed motor and a continuously adjustable mechanical speed-changing device might also be called an adjustable speed drive. Power electronics based variable frequency drives are rapidly making older technology redundant.
