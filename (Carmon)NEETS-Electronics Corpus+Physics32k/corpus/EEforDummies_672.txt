▶✓ Mixed signal ICs: These ICs contain a combination of analog and digi-
tal circuits and are commonly used to convert analog signals to digital 
signals for use in digital devices. Analog‐to‐digital converters (ADCs), 
digital‐to‐analog converters (DACs), and digital radio processors are 
examples of mixed signal chips.
