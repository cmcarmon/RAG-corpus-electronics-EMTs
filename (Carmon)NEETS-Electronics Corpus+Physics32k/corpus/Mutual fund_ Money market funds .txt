Money market funds invest in money market instruments, which are fixed income securities with a very short time to maturity and high credit quality. Investors often use money market funds as a substitute for bank savings accounts, though money market funds are not insured by the government, unlike bank savings accounts.
In the United States, money market funds sold to retail investors and those investing in government securities may maintain a stable net asset value of $1 per share, when they comply with certain conditions. (Other money market funds must compute a net asset value based on the value of the securities held in the funds.)
In the United States at the end of 2016, assets in money market funds were $2.7 trillion, representing 14% of the industry.
