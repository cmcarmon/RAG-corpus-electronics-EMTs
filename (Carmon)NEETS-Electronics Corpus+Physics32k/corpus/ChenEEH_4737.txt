The direct approach presented here has several advantages
with respect to indirect approaches such as in KrsticÂ´ et al.
(1995), Polycarpou (1996), and Polycarpou and Mears
(1998). In particular, bounds on the input functions cj
i are
only assumed to exist and need neither to be known nor to be
estimated. This is because the ideal law is formulated so that
there is not an explicit need to include information about the
bounds in the actual control law. Moreover, although assump-
tion of equation 12.2 appears to be more restrictive than what
is needed in the indirect adaptive case, it is in fact not so
