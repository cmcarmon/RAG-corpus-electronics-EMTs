One of the salient features of a full-bridge converter is that by using proper control technique it can
be operated in zero-voltage switching (ZVS) mode. This type of operation results in negligible switching
losses.  However,  at  reduced  load  currents,  the  ZVS  property  is  lost.  Recently,  there  has  been  a  lot  of
effort to overcome this problem.
