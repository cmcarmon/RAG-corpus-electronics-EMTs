If a rocket is launched to deliver a payload from a planetary surface into space it is called a launch vehicle.
There are several broad categories that launch vehicles fall under, including:
Expendable launch system
Reusable launch system
Single stage to orbit
Two stage to orbit
Three stage to orbit
For the launch vehicles currently in use for human spaceflight, see that article. There were over 70 orbital launches in 2010.
