Operating Systems
Operating system (OS) is the next layer of technology that makes the microprocessor card a smart card. The
term  operating  system  applied  to  a  smart  card  is  in  some  sense  misleading  as  in  many  cases  even  highly
experienced programmer/analysts would not be able to ﬁnd a clear borderline between “system” and “applica-
tive” layers. Due to continuous memory constraints smart card software designers chose the formula of “nested
functionalities” that ﬁnally resulted in placing real functionality inside OS services (or the opposite, depending
on  your  point  of  view).  Each  card  manufacturer  has  its  own  family  of  operating  systems  offering  different
dedicated functionalities to the user that are characteristic of the speciﬁc manufacturer. That type of OS forms
a vast group of software products called proprietary OS.
