Quantum gravity effects are notoriously difficult to measure because the Planck length is so incredibly small. However recently physicists have started to consider the possibility of measuring quantum gravity effects mostly from astrophysical observations and gravitational wave detectors.The energy of those fluctuations at scales this small cause space-perturbations which are visible at higher scales.
