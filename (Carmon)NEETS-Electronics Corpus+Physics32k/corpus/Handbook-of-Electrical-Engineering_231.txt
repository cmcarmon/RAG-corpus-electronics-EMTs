The  classical  methods  of  nodal  and  loop  (mesh)  analysis  incorporate  controlled  sources  without  great
difÔ¨Åculty. For purposes of determining the number of independent variables required, that is, in establishing
the  topology  of  the  circuit,  the  controlled  sources  are  treated  as  ordinary  voltage  or  current  sources.  The
equations  are  then  written  according  to  the  usual  procedures.  Before  the  equations  are  solved,  however,  the
controlling variables must be expressed in terms of the unknowns of the problem. For example, let us say we
