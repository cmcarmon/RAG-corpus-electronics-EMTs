of their nominal values. Markings on the resistor package will tell you 
just how far off the actual resistance may be (for instance, ±2%, ±5%, 
±10%, or ±20%). You use standard‐precision resistors in most hobby 
projects because (more often than not) you’re using resistors to limit 
current or divide voltages to within an acceptable range. Resistors with 
5% or 10% tolerance are commonly used in electronic circuits.
