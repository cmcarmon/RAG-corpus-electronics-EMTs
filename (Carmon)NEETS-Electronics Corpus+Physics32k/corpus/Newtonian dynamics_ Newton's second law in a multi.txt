particles with masses

{\displaystyle \displaystyle m_{1},\,\ldots ,\,m_{N}}
in the regular three-dimensional Euclidean space. Let






r

r


N





{\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{1},\,\ldots ,\,\mathbf {r} _{N}}
be their radius-vectors in some inertial coordinate system. Then the motion of these particles is governed by Newton's second law applied to each of them

The three-dimensional radius-vectors

In terms of the multidimensional vectors (2) the equations (1) are written as

i. e they take the form of Newton's second law applied to a single particle with the unit mass

Definition. The equations (3) are called the equations of a Newtonian dynamical system in a flat multidimensional Euclidean space, which is called the configuration space of this system. Its points are marked by the radius-vector





r




{\displaystyle \displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
. The space whose points are marked by the pair of vectors




(

v

)



{\displaystyle \displaystyle (\mathbf {r} ,\mathbf {v} )}
is called the phase space of the dynamical system (3).
