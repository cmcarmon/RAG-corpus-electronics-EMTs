When two atoms are connected by a chemical bond, they tend to maintain a fixed distance. The fixed distance depends on the atoms that forms the bond. Any variation from this fixed distance which is the equilibrium point adds additional potential energy to the protein. This is similar to the concept of Hooke's Law, so the bond can be envisaged as a spring connecting the atoms together. Total potential energy based on bond length is over set Sbond set of pairs of atoms that are connected by chemical bond defined as;
Ebond = Σ (i,j) E Sbond kijb(αij-αij0)2
where:
kijb is the force constant
αij0 is the equilibrium length
αij is the current length
for the bond between ith and jth atoms.
Just as the potential energy can be written as a quadratic form in the internal coordinates, so it can also be written in terms of generalized forces. The resulting coefficients are termed compliance constants.
