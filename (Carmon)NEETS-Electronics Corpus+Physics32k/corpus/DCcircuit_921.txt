Typically, the rheostat arm of the bridge (R2 in the diagram) is set at a value equal to the
strain gauge resistance with no force applied. The two ratio arms of the bridge (R1 and R3)
are set equal to each other. Thus, with no force applied to the strain gauge, the bridge will
be symmetrically balanced and the voltmeter will indicate zero volts, representing zero force
on the strain gauge. As the strain gauge is either compressed or tensed, its resistance will
decrease or increase, respectively, thus unbalancing the bridge and producing an indication at
the voltmeter. This arrangement, with a single element of the bridge changing resistance in
response to the measured variable (mechanical force), is known as a quarter-bridge circuit.
