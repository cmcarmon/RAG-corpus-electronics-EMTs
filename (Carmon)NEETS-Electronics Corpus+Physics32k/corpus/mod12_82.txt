The amplitude, on the other hand, may differ from the amplitude of the applied voltage. Furthermore, 
the phase of the voltage developed by any of the impedances may not be identical to the phase of the 
voltage across any of the other impedances or the phase of the applied voltage. If an impedance is a 
reactive component (coil or capacitor), voltage or current may lead or lag, but the wave shape will remain 
the same. In a linear circuit, the output of the generator is not distorted. The frequency remains the same 
throughout the entire circuit and no new frequencies are generated.
