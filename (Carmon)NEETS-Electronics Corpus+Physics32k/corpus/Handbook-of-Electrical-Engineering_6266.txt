At the completion of each line scan in a receiver or monitor, a horizontal synchronizing (H-sync) pulse in
the composite video signal triggers the scanning circuits to return the beam rapidly to the left of the screen for
the start of the next line scan. During the return time, a horizontal blanking signal at a level lower than that
corresponding to the blackest portion of the scene is added to avoid the visibility of the retrace lines. In a similar
manner, after completion of each ﬁeld, a vertical blanking signal blanks out the retrace portion of the scanning
beam as it returns to the top of the picture to start the scan of the next ﬁeld. The small-level difference between
video reference black and blanking level is called setup. Setup is used as a guard band to ensure separation of the
synchronizing and video-information functions and adequate blanking of the scanning retrace lines on receivers.
The waveforms of Fig. 69.18 show the various reference levels of video and sync in the composite signal. The
unit of measurement for video level was speciﬁed initially by the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). These IRE
units are still used to quantify video signal levels. The primary IRE values are given in Table 69.8.
