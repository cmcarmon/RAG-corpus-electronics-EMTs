The two components of electric service are demand and energy. Demand is the maximum
level of real power which the electric utility must supply to satisfy the load requirements of its
customers. Energy is the cumulative use of electric power over a period of time. The demand
component of the electric-rate structure represents the capital investment needed by the utility
to provide the generation, transmission, and distribution facilities in order to meet the maximum
customer demand. The energy component represents the operating costs, which include fuel and
maintenance that must be provided to meet the demand requirements over a period of time.
