(cid:1) This chapter introduced the digital abstraction, which is based on the notion
high and low. Digital circuits
of lumping signal values into two levels
are designed to be more immune to noise than their analog counterparts.
The degree of noise immunity of a digital circuit is governed by the voltage
thresholds of the static discipline to which the circuit adheres.
