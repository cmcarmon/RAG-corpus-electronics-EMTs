Figure 1-4 illustrates a radar system with a 1 millisecond prt. The pulses are shown at the top, and
examples of two transmitted pulses hitting targets and returning are shown at the bottom. In the case of
target A, the pulse travels round trip in 0.5 millisecond, which equates to a target range of 82,000 yards.
Since 0.5 millisecond is less than 1 millisecond, displaying a correct range is no problem. However, target
B is 196,800 yards distant from the radar system. In this case, total pulse travel time is 1.2 milliseconds
and exceeds the prt limitation of 1 millisecond for this radar. While the first transmitted pulse is traveling
to and returning from target B, a second pulse is transmitted and the radar system is reset to 0 again. The
first pulse from target B continues its journey back to the radar system, but arrives during the timing
period for the second pulse. This results in an inaccurate reading. In this case, the first return pulse from
target B arrives 0.2 millisecond into the second timing period. This results in a range of 32,800 yards
instead of the actual 196,800 yards. You should see from this example that pulse returns in excess of the
prt of the radar system result in ambiguous ranges while pulse returns within the prt limits result in
