The  capability  of  equipment  or  systems  to  be  operated  in  their
intended operational environment at designed levels of efÔ¨Åciency without causing or receiving degrada-
tion owing to unintentional electromagnetic interference. Electromagnetic compatibility is the result of
an  engineering  planning  process  applied  during  the  life  cycle  of  the  equipment.  The  process  involves
careful considerations of frequency allocation, design, procurement, production, site selection, installa-
tion, operation, and maintenance.
