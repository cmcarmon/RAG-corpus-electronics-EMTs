The grounded end of the quarter-wave antenna has a low input impedance and has low voltage and 
high current at the input end, as shown in figure 4-18. The ungrounded end has a high impedance, which 
causes high voltage and low current. The directional characteristics of a grounded quarter-wave antenna 
are the same as those of a half-wave antenna in free space.
