The purpose of a voltmeter is to indicate the potential difference between two points in a circuit.
When a voltmeter is connected across a circuit, it shunts the circuit. If the voltmeter has a low resistance,
it will draw a substantial amount of current. This action lowers the effective resistance of the circuit and
changes the voltage reading. When you are making voltage measurements in high-resistance circuits, use
a HIGH-RESISTANCE VOLTMETER to prevent the shunting action of the voltmeter. The effect is less
noticeable in low-resistance circuits because the shunting effect is less. The problem of voltmeter
shunting (sometimes called circuit loading) is illustrated in figure 3-11.
