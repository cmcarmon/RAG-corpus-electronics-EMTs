The cost of the memory organization does not only depend on
the allocation of memories, however, but also on the assignment
of arrays to the memories (the previous discussion assumes an
optimal assignment). When several memories are available, many
ways exist to assign the arrays to them. The paragraph on the cost
of conﬂicts in Subsection 2.6.3 demonstrates some of these issues.
In addition, the optimal assignment of arrays to memories
depends on the memories used. For example, the energy con-
sumption of some memories is very sensitive to their size, while
for others it is not. In the former case, it may be advantageous to
accept some wasted bits to keep the heavily accessed memories
very small, whereas in the latter case, the reverse may be true. To
ﬁnd a (near optimal signal-to-memory assignment, a huge
number of possibilities have to be considered. Therefore, a tool
to explore the memory organization possibilities based on a good
memory library is indispensable for this step.
