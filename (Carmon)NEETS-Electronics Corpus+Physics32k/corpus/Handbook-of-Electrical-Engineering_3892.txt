This is the equation for a parabola. Losses would be minimized if the wave front were specularly reﬂected to
the transceiver. Specular reﬂection occurs when the angles between the normal vector N [or equivalently the
tangent vector T = (x,f¢ ¢(x))] = (1, x/2h) and the vectors A = (0, –1) and B = (–x, h – y) are equal. This is the
same as equality of the inner products of the normalized vectors, which is shown by
