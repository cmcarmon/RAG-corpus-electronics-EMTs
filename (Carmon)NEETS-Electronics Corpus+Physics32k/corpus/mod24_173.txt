In silica glass, the wavelengths of operation range from 700 nanometers (nm) to 1600 nm. Figure
2-21 shows the level of attenuation at the wavelengths of operation. This wavelength of operation is
between two intrinsic absorption regions. The first region is the ultraviolet region (below 400-nm
wavelength). The second region is the infrared region (above 2000-nm wavelength).
