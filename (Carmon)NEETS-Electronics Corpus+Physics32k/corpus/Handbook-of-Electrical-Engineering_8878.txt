Main memories are comprised of a series of semiconductor memory chips. A number of these chips, like caches,
 (or parallel) memory
form a 
 requests
system. Since each bank can service a request, an interleaved memory system with 
  times  the  bandwidth  of  a  single
simultaneously,  increasing  the  peak  bandwidth  of  the  memory  system  to 
n
-bit
bank. In most interleaved memory systems, the number of banks is a power of two, that is, 
m-bit address of a word within a
memory word address is broken into two parts: a 
bank. Though the k bits used to select a bank number could be any k bits of the n-bit word address, typical
interleaved memory systems use the low-order k address bits to select the bank number; the higher order m =
n â€“ k bits of the word address are used to access a word in the selected bank. The reason for using the low-
order k bits will be discussed shortly. An interleaved memory system which uses the low-order k bits to select
the bank is referred to as a low-order or a standard interleaved memory.
