Thus, the output has a Fourier series, which means that it too is periodic. Its Fourier coeﬃcients equal
. To obtain the spectrum of the output, we simply multiply the input spectrum by
ckH
the frequency response. The circuit modiﬁes the magnitude and phase of each Fourier coeﬃcient. Note
especially that while the Fourier coeﬃcients do not depend on the signal’s period, the circuit’s transfer
function does depend on frequency, which means that the circuit’s output will diﬀer as the period varies.
