A common weak link, known as the Josephson tunnel junction, is made by separating two superconducting
ﬁlms  with  a  very  thin  (typically  20  Å)  insulating  layer.  Such  a  structure  is  conveniently  analyzed  using  the
resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model shown in Fig. 53.3. Under the RCSJ model an ideal
lumped junction [described by Eqs. (53.14) and (53.15)] and a resistor Rj represent how the weak link structure
inﬂuences  the  respective  phases  of  the  super  and  normal  electrons.  A  capacitor  Cj  represents  the  physical
capacitance of the sandwich structure. Parasitic capacitance created by the ﬁelds around a device interacting
with a dielectric substrate is also included in this lumped element. If the ideal lumped junction portion of the
circuit is treated as an inductor-like element, many Josephson tunnel junction properties can be calculated with
the familiar circuit time constants associated with the model. For example, the quality factor Q of the RCSJ
circuit can be expressed as
