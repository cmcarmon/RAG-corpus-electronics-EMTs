where N(s) denotes the numerator polynomial and D(s) denotes the denominator polynomial. As
a ﬁrst step in the expansion of the quotient N (s)/D(s), we check to see that the degree of the
polynomial N is less than that of D. If this condition is not satisﬁed, divide the numerator by the
denominator to obtain an expansion in the form
