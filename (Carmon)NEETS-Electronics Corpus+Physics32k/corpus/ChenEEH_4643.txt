plant signal. Control problems in which this performance
measure arise are prevalent in the literature: motor control
problems with electrical (voltage or current) or mechanical
(motion) restrictions and process control problems with
chemical concentration restrictions are two examples. In each
of these examples, violation of the amplitude restrictions can
lead to performance degradation and possibly catastrophic
system failure.
In these types of performance problems,
energy-based design techniques, such as the technique de-
scribed in Subsection 9.3.1 are often inadequate. The problem
considered in this section is that of synthesizing LPV control-
lers so that the controlled system satisÔ¨Åes bounded amplitude
performance constraints; the approach presented here is based
on results reported in Bett and Lemmon (1997).
