In contrast to the resistor, which exhibits an algebraic relation between its
branch current and voltage, the capacitor does not. Rather, it exhibits an alge-
braic relation between its branch voltage and its stored charge. Had the dielectric
not been linear, this relation would have been nonlinear. While some capacitors
exhibit such nonlinear behavior, we will focus only on linear capacitors.
