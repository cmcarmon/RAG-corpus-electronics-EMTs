Now, consider what happens in view D when the TX rotor is turned manually to 75º and the TDX 
rotor is set manually on 30º. When the TX rotor is turned to 75º, magnetic coupling increases between the 
rotor and S1. This, in turn, increases the voltage in S1 and, therefore, the magnetic field surrounding it. At 
the same time, the field in S2 and S3 decreases proportionately. This causes the resultant TX stator field 
to line up in the direction of its rotor. The increased voltage in S1 of the TX also causes an increase in 
current flow through S1 in the TDX, while decreased currents flow through S2 and S3. Therefore, a 
strong magnetic field is established around the S1 winding in the TDX. This field has the greatest effect 
on the resultant TDX stator field and causes it to line up in the same relative direction as the TX stator 
field (75º). The TDX stator field does not move from this 75º position because it is controlled by the 
position of the TX rotor. However, its angular position with respect to the R2 winding decreases by 30 
when the TDX rotor is turned. Therefore, the signal induced into the TDX rotor and transmitted to the TR 
is 45º. The TR rotor responds to the transmitted signal and turns counterclockwise to 45º. This system has 
just solved the equation 75º − 30º  = 45º.
