Computation of dodecatemoria could have helped the ancient astronomer by, simply, giving him more symbolic data to interpret.
The dodecatemoria could also crudely represent the motion of the moon across the ecliptic during the course of one month. Possibly they use a "virtual moon", imagined conjunct with the Sun (i.e., new) at the beginning of a sign, to symbolize divisions within the sign.
A Greek text (found in two existing codicies) connects the dodecatemoria with the homo signorum ("Zodiac Man") in which zodiacal signs are allocated evenly across the body from Aries at the head to Pisces at the feet. In this text, body parts are listed alongside degree numbers 2, 5, 7, 10, etc., corresponding to increments of 2.5Â° rounded down. The order of body parts modifies the usual list to accommodate the special characteristics of the sign; for example, most of the animal signs have "tail" as their final part, while Scorpio has "sting", and the list in Gemini and Pisces is doubled.
Like the 12-part zodiac, division of the signs into body parts (equated at some point with the signs) could have allowed ancient astronomers to describe parts of the sky (and record observations of celestial bodies located therein) with greater precision and convenience. Late Babylonian texts also give rising times for dodecatemoria during the course of a single day.
