Since most cable wires are stranded, it is necessary to use terminal lugs to hold the strands together 
to aid in fastening the wires to terminal studs (see figure 2-11). The terminals used in electrical wiring are 
either of the soldered or crimped type. Terminals used in repair work must be of the size and type 
specified on the electrical wiring diagram for the particular equipment.
