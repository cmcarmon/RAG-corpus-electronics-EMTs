A problem that is even more signiﬁcant than parasitic substrate dynamics stems from the fact that the hybrid-
pi equivalent circuit in Fig. 28.11 is premised on a uniform transistor structure whose emitter-base and base-
collector junction areas are identical. In a monolithic device, however, the effective base-collector junction area
is much larger than that of the emitter-base junction because the base region is diffused or implanted into the
collector [Glaser and Subak-Sharpe, 1977]. The effect of such a geometry is twofold. First, the actual value of
Cm is larger than the value predicated on the physical considerations that surround a simpliﬁed uniform structure
BJT. Second, Cm is not a single lumped capacitance that is incident with only the intrinsic base-collector junction.
Rather,  the  effective  value  of  Cm  is  distributed  between  the  intrinsic  collector  and  the  entire  base-collector
junction  interface. A  ﬁrst-order  account  of  this  capacitance  distribution  entails  partitioning Cm  in  Fig.  28.11
into two capacitances, say Cm1 and Cm2, as indicated in Fig. 28.13. In general, Cm2 is 3 to 5 times larger than Cm1.
Whereas  Cm1  is  proportional  to  the  emitter-base  junction  area,  Cm2  is  proportional  to  the  net  base-collector
junction area, less the area of the emitter-base junction.
