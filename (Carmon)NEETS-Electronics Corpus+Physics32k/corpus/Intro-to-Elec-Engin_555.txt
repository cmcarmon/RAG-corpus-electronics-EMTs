Analog-to-Digital (A/D) Converters
An A/D converter converts analog input signals into digital output data in many areas such as
process control, aircraft control, and telemetry. Being the interface between analog systems and
digital systems, it plays a key role in many industrial, commercial, and military systems. Several
types of A/D converters exist: counter-controlled, successive-approximation, and dual-ramp
(dual-slope) converters. One should understand its basic operation because analog comparators
form the basis of A/D converters. Figure 6.2.12 shows the block diagram of an analog comparator.
The commercially available LM311 is an example that is widely used by designers.
