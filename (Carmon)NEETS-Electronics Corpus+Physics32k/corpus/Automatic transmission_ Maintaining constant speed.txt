Torque converters and CVT transmissions make changes in vehicle speed less apparent by the engine noise, as they decouple the engine speed from vehicle speed.
Lockup torque converters that engage and disengage at certain speeds can make these speeds unstable â€” the transmission wastes less power above the speed at which the torque converter locks up, usually causing more power to the wheels for the same throttle input.
