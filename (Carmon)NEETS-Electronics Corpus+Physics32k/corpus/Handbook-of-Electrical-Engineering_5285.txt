The vigorous growth of PV technology is manifested by a doubling of world PV module shipments in six
years â€” from 42 MW in 1989 to 84 MW in 1995. Tens of thousands of small (<1 kW) systems are in operation
around  the  world.  Thousands  of  kilowatt-size  systems  (1  to  10s  of  kW)  also  have  been  installed  and  are  in
operation. Many intermediate-scale systems (10 to 100s of kW) and large-scale systems (1 MW or larger) are
being installed by utility- and government-sponsored programs as proof-of-concept experiments and to glean
valuable operational data.
