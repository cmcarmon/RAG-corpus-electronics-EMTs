The final approach point on an instrument approach with vertical guidance is glide slope or glide path intercept at the lowest published altitude (ICAO definition).
In the US, it is called the final approach fix (FAF) and marked on a NACO IAP by a lightning bolt symbol and on a Jeppesen terminal chart by the end of the glide slope path symbol. It is the point in space where the final approach segment begins on the instrument approach; the final approach point on a non-precision approach is marked by a maltese cross symbol. In the US, where the approach navigation aid is on the field and there is no depicted, the final approach point is "where the aircraft is established inbound on the final approach course from the procedure turn and where the final approach descent may be commenced".
