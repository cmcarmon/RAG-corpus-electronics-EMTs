The compound then forms in situ on the heated wafer (.500(cid:176)C). Even then, however, a subsequent anneal is
often required. With PVD methods it is much more difﬁcult to change the composition since now the oxide
or metal ratios of the target have to be changed or dopants have to be added. This involves the fabrication of
a new target for each composition ratio. MOCVD is an exception here; the ratio is adjusted by regulating the
carrier gas ﬂow. However, the equipment is very expensive and the substrate temperatures tend to be high (up
to 800(cid:176), uncomfortably high for semiconductor device processing). The laser sputtering method is very attractive
and it has produced very ﬁne ﬁlms. The disadvantage is that the ﬁlms are deﬁned by the plume which forms
when  the  laser  beam  is  directed  at  the  source.  This  produces  only  small  areas  of  good  ﬁlms  and  scanning
methods need to be developed to cover full size silicon wafers. Debris is also a signiﬁcant issue in laser deposition.
However,  it  is  a  convenient  method  to  produce  ﬁlms  quickly  and  with  a  small  investment.  In  the  long  run
MOCVD or Sol-Gel will probably evolve as the method of choice for realistic DRAM devices with state of the
art densities.
