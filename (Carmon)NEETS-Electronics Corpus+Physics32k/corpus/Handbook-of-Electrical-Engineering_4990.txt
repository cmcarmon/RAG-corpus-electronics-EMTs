In  the  case  of  solid  dielectrics  the  breakdown  is  dependent  not  only  upon  the  molecular  structure  and
morphology of the solid but also upon extraneous variables such as the geometry of the material, the temper-
ature,  and  the  ambient  environment.  Since  breakdown  often  occurs  along  some  fault  of  the  material,  the
breakdown  voltage  displays  a  readily  perceptible  decrease  with  area  and  thickness  of  the  specimen  due  to
increased  incidence  of  faults  over  larger  volumes.  This  is  indeed  part  of  the  reason  why  thin-ﬁlm  inorganic
dielectrics,  which  are  normally  evaluated  using  small-diameter  dot  counter  electrodes,  exhibit  exceptionally
high  dielectric  strengths. With  large  organic  dielectric  specimens,  recessed  electrodes  are  used  to  minimize
electrode  edge  effects,  leading  to  greatly  elevated  breakdown  strengths  in  the  order  of  106  to  107  kV  cm–1,  a
range of values which is considered to represent the ultimate breakdown strength of the material or its intrinsic
breakdown strength; as the intrinsic breakdown occurs in approximately 10–8 to 10–6 s, an electronic mechanism
is implicated.
