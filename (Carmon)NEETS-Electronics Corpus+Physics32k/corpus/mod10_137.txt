The electromagnetic energy of light is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Light and similar forms
of radiation are made up of moving electric and magnetic forces and move as waves. Electromagnetic
waves move in a manner similar to the waves produced by the pebble dropped in the pool of water
discussed earlier in this chapter. The transverse waves of light from a light source spread out in expanding
circles much like the waves in the pool. However, the waves in the pool are very slow and clumsy in
comparison with light, which travels approximately 186,000 miles per second.
