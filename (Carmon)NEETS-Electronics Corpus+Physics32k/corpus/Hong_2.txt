A basic understanding of electronic circuits is important even if the designer does 
not  intend  to  become  a  proficient  electrical  engineer.  In  many  real-life  engineering 
projects, it is often necessary to communicate, and also negotiate, specifications between 
engineering teams having different areas of expertise. Therefore, a basic understanding of 
electronic circuits will allow the mechanical engineer to evaluate whether or not a given 
electrical specification is reasonable and feasible.
