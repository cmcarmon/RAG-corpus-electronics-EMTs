Level 9 provides services for long-term storage of ﬁles.
While level 6 deals with disk storage in terms of tracks and
sectors, which are the physical units of the hardware, level 9
deals with more abstract entities of variable length. Indeed, a
ﬁle may be scattered over many noncontiguous tracks and
sectors. To be examined or updated, a ﬁle’s contents must be
copied between virtual memory and the secondary storage
system. If a ﬁle is kept on a different machine, level 9 software
can retrieve it by creating a pipe to level 9 on the ﬁle’s home
machine.
