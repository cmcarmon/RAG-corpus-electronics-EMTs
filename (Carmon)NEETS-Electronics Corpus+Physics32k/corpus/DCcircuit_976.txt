Since the ratios of R1/R4 and R2/R5 are unequal, we know that there will be voltage across
resistor R3, and some amount of current through it. As discussed at the beginning of this
chapter, this type of circuit is irreducible by normal series-parallel analysis, and may only be
analyzed by some other method.
