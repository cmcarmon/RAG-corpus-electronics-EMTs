If the excessive current flow caused by the direct short is left unchecked, the heat in the wire will
continue to increase until some portion of the circuit burns. Perhaps a portion of the wire will melt and
open the circuit so that nothing is damaged other than the wire involved. The probability exists, however,
that much greater damage will result. The heat in the wire can char and burn the insulation of the wire and
that of other wires bundled with it, which can cause more shorts. If a fuel or oil leak is near any of the hot
wires, a disastrous fire might be started.
