FM Spectrum
The monophonic system was initially developed to allow sound transmissions for audio frequencies from 50
to 15,000 Hz to be contained within a â€“75-kHz RF bandwidth. With the development of FM stereo, the original
FM signal (consisting of a left-plus-right channel) is transmitted in a smaller bandwidth to be compatible with
a monophonic FM receiver, and a left-minus-right channel is frequency-multiplexed on a subcarrier of 38-kHz
using  double-sideband  suppressed  carrier.  An  unmodulated  19-kHz  subcarrier  is  derived  from  the  38-kHz
subcarrier to provide a synchronous demodulation reference for the stereophonic receiver. The synchronous
detector at 38 kHz recovers the left-minus-right channel information, which is then combined with the left-
plus-right channel information in sum and difference combiners to produce the original left-channel and right-
channel signals. In addition stations may utilize an SCA in a variety of ways, such as paging, data transmission,
specialized foreign language programs, radio reading services, utility load management, and background music.
An  FM  stereo  station  may  utilize  multiplex  subcarriers  within  the  range  of  53  to  99 kHz  with  up  to  20%
modulation of the main carrier using any form of modulation. The only requirement is that the station does
not exceed its occupied bandwidth limitations.
