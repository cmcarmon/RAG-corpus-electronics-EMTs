Nonsinusoidal oscillators generate complex waveforms, such as square, rectangular, trigger, 
sawtooth, or trapezoidal. Because their outputs are generally characterized by a sudden change, or 
relaxation, they are often referred to as RELAXATION OSCILLATORS. The signal frequency of these 
oscillators is usually governed by the charge or discharge time of a capacitor in series with a resistor. 
Some types, however, contain inductors that affect the output frequency. Thus, like sinusoidal oscillators, 
both RC and LC networks are used for determining the frequency of oscillation. Within this category of 
nonsinusoidal oscillators are MULTIVIBRATORS, BLOCKING OSCILLATORS, SAWTOOTH 
GENERATORS, and TRAPEZOIDAL GENERATORS.
