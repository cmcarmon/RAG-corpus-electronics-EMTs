If a force acts on a particle as it moves from point A to point B, then, for each possible trajectory that the particle may take, it is possible to compute the total work done by the force along the path. The principle of virtual work, which is the form of the principle of least action applied to these systems, states that the path actually followed by the particle is the one for which the difference between the work along this path and other nearby paths is zero (to first order). The formal procedure for computing the difference of functions evaluated on nearby paths is a generalization of the derivative known from differential calculus, and is termed the calculus of variations.
Consider a point particle that moves along a path which is described by a function r(t) from point A, where r(t = t0), to point B, where r(t = t1). It is possible that the particle moves from A to B along a nearby path described by r(t) + δr(t), where δr(t) is called the variation of r(t). The variation δr(t) satisfies the requirement δr(t0) = δr(t1) = 0. The components of the variation, δr1(t), δr2(t) and δr3(t), are called virtual displacements. This can be generalized to an arbitrary mechanical system defined by the generalized coordinates qi , i = 1, ..., n. In which case, the variation of the trajectory qi (t) is defined by the virtual displacements δqi , i = 1, ..., n.
Virtual work is the total work done by the applied forces and the inertial forces of a mechanical system as it moves through a set of virtual displacements. When considering forces applied to a body in static equilibrium, the principle of least action requires the virtual work of these forces to be zero.
