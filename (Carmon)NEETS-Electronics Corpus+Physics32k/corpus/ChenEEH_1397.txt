Schmit et al. (2000) have developed a reconﬁgurable FPGA
targeted toward pipelined designs. Reconﬁguration is per-
formed at the level of individual pipeline stages, similar to
that described in Figure 3.2. Others have shown that commer-
cial partially reconﬁgurable FPGAs can also support efﬁcient
reconﬁguration of pipelined designs (Luk et al., 1997).
