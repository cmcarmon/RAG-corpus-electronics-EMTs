System Software
The development of system software, such as operating systems, programming languages and program execution
environments,  has  been  slower  than  that  of  hardware,  but  is  nonetheless  impressive.  Less  impressive  is  the
steadily  increasing  cost  of  application  software,  estimated  at  about  80%  of  the  total  installation  cost  of  a
computing  system,  which  developments  in  computer  science  have  been  largely  unable  to  reduce. We  are,  in
fact, in the midst of a software crisis, dating from about 1968, which is the result of ever increasing improvements
in  hardware.  Such  improvements  increase  the  possibilities  for  software,  raise  the  expectations  of  users,  and
therefore raise the stakes in software production faster than improvements in software development technology
has been made.
