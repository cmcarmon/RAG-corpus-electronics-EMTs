We see from the above discussion that the solution growth
factor q under conditions of numerical instability is the same,
regardless of the dimensionality of the FDTD space lattice if
the same normalized Courant factor is used. A normalized
Courant factor equal to 1 yields no exponential solution
growth for any dimensionality grid. However, a normalized
Courant factor only 0.05% larger, yields a multiplicative solu-
tion growth of 1.0653 every time-step for each dimensionality
grid:
