If greater permanence is desired without resorting to soldering or wire-wrapping, one could
choose to construct this circuit on a terminal strip (also called a barrier strip, or terminal
block). In this method, components and wires are secured by mechanical tension underneath
screws or heavy clips attached to small metal bars. The metal bars, in turn, are mounted on a
nonconducting body to keep them electrically isolated from each other.
