The bistable multivibrator that most technicians know is commonly known by other names: the 
ECCLES-JORDAN circuit and, more commonly, the FLIP-FLOP circuit (figure 3-18). The flip-flop is a 
bistable multivibrator, "bi" meaning two; that is, the flip-flop has two stable states. The flip-flop (f/f) can 
rapidly flip from one state to the other and then flop back to its original state. If a voltmeter were 
connected to the output of a flip-flop, it would measure either a small positive or negative voltage, or a 
particularly low voltage (essentially 0 volts). No matter which voltage is measured, the flip-flop would be 
stable. Remember, stable means that the flip-flop will remain in a particular state indefinitely. It will not 
change states unless the proper type of trigger pulse is applied.
