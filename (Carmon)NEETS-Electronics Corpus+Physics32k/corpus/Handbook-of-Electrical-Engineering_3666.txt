On removing the applied ﬁeld, the sample does not retrace the magnetization curve, and when the applied
ﬁeld is zero, we can see that a considerable amount of magnetization remains, Mr. Appropriately, this is referred
to as the remanent state, and Mr is the remanent magnetization. By reversing the original direction of the applied
ﬁeld, domains reappear and the magnetization is eventually reduced to zero at the coercive ﬁeld, Hc. It should
be noticed that, at Hc, although the net magnetization is clearly zero, the individual domains may be magnetized
in  directions  that  are  different  from  those  at  the  starting  point.  Figure  36.6  shows  an  incomplete  hysteresis
loop. If the ﬁeld H were increased beyond +Hc the loop would be completed.
