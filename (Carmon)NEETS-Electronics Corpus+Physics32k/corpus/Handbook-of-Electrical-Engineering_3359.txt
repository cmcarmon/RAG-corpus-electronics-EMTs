Active components are realized by placing electrodes in close proximity to the waveguide structures. Depend-
ing on the substrate crystallographic orientation, the waveguide geometry, and the electrode geometry, a wide
variety  of  components  can  be  demonstrated.  The  simplest  active  device  is  the phase modulator,  which  is  a
single waveguide with electrodes on either side as shown in Fig. 31.20. Applying a voltage across the electrodes
induces  an  electric  Ô¨Åeld  across  the  waveguide,  which  changes  its  refractive  index  via  the  electro-optic  effect.
For  800-nm  wavelength  operation,  a  typical  phase  modulator  would  be  6  mm  long  and  would  induce  a p-
phase shift for an applied voltage of 4 V. The transfer function (light out versus voltage in) can be expressed as
