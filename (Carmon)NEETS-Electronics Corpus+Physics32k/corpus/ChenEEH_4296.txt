The separation of call control and services (Figure 8.2) from
the underlying transport network is a key enabling feature of
softswitch-based networks. Indeed, the very approach of build-
ing switched networks with extracted service intelligence rep-
resents a major break-through when compared to the circuit-
switched approach of combining the transport hardware, call
control, and service logic together into a single, proprietary
piece of equipment.
