For very large gears or spline, a vertical broach is used. It consists of a vertical rail that carries a single tooth cutter formed to create the tooth shape. A rotary table and a Y axis are the customary axes available. Some machines will cut to a depth on the Y axis and index the rotary table automatically. The largest gears are produced on these machines.
Other operations such as broaching work particularly well for cutting teeth on the inside. The downside to this is that it is expensive and different broach sticks are required to make different sized gears. Therefore, it is mostly used in very high production runs.
