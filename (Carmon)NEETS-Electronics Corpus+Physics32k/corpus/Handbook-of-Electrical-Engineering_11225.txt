), and consequently,
If process 
)  is  also  zero.  This  property  makes  the  estimated  bispectrum
its  Fourier  transform,  the  bispectrum, 
an immediate measure describing the degree of deviation from gaussian behavior. In our studies [Ning and
Bronzino, 1989a,b], the sum of magnitude of the estimated bispectrum was used as a measure to describe the
EEGâ€™s deviation from gaussian behavior, that is,
