While there are several mechanical cleaving methods to produce boron nitride nanosheets, they employ the same principle: using shear forces to break the Van der Waals interactions between the layers of boron nitride. The advantage of mechanical cleavage is that the nanosheets isolated from these techniques have few defects and retain the lateral size of the original substrate.
Inspired by its use in the isolation of graphene, micromechanical cleavage, also known as the Scotch-tape method, has been used to consistently isolate few-layer and monolayer boron nitride nanosheets by subsequent exfoliation of the beginning material with adhesive tape. However, the disadvantage of this technique is that it is not scalable for large scale production.
Ball milling is another technique used to mechanically exfoliate boron nitride sheets from the parent substrate. In this process, shear forces are applied on the face of bulk boron nitride by rolling balls, which break the Van der Waal interactions between each layer. While the ball milling technique may allow for large quantities of boron nitride nanosheets, it does not allow for control the size or the number of layers of the resulting nanosheets. Furthermore, these nanosheets have more defects due to the aggressive nature of this technique. However, improvements such as the addition of a milling agent such as benzyl benzoate or the use of smaller balls has allowed for a greater yield of higher quality nanosheets.
Boron nitride nanosheets have also been isolated by using a vortex fluidic device, which uses centripetal force to shear off layers of boron nitride.
