Self-gravity is influential in understanding sea level and the ice caps for oceanographers and geologists, which is particularly important as we go forward trying to anticipate the effects of climate change. The deformation on the Earth from the forces of the oceans can be calculated if the Earth is treated as fluid and the effects of self-gravity are taken into account and this allowed for the influence of ocean tide loading to be taken into account when observing the Earth's deformation response to harmonic surface loading. The results of calculating post-glacial sea levels near the ice caps are significantly different when using a flat Earth model that does not take self-gravity into account, as opposed to a spherical Earth where self-gravity is taken into account because of the sensitivity of the data in these regions, which shows how results can drastically change when self-gravity is ignored. There has also been research done to better understand Laplace's Tidal Equations to try to understand how deformation of the Earth and self-gravity within the ocean affect the M2 tidal constituent (the tides dictated by the Moon). There have been suggestions that if the Greenland ice complex melts, the sea level will actually fall around Greenland and rise in areas further away because the effects of self-gravity (see Post-glacial rebound).
