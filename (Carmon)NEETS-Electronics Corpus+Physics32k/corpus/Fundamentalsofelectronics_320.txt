Problem 3.33: Analog “Hum” Rejection
“Hum” refers to corruption from wall socket power that frequently sneaks into circuits. “Hum” gets its name
because it sounds like a persistent humming sound. We want to ﬁnd a circuit that will remove hum from any
signal. A Rice engineer suggests using a simple voltage divider circuit consisting of two series impedances
(Figure 3.72).
