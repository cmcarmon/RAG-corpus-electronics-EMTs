A transformer may at some point be subjected to current in
excess of its rated load current. Current up to approximately
2% of the rated load current can be anticipated from overload
conditions on the system. These currents may last only a few
minutes or several hours. Faults on the system will subject the
transformer to peak overcurrents that may be up to 40 times
the rated load current. These currents may produce either
mechanical or thermal damage to the transformer. Mechanical
forces are proportional to the square of the current and mani-
fest themselves in a number of different failure mechanisms.
These failure mechanisms include loosening of coils, con-
ductor tipping, radial and axial conductor buckling, winding
deformation, core deformation, and telescoping of windings.
