Two-terminal elements are said to be connected in parallel if
the same voltage exists across all the elements and if they have
two distinct common nodes as shown in Figure 1.13. In the case
of a parallel connection, conductances, which are reciprocals of
resistances, sum to give an equivalent conductance of Geq:
