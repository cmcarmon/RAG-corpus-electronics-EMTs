Both impulse and reaction turbines have been employed for small-scale hydro for DG. Several standardized
units are available in the market. Most of the units are operated at constant speed with governor control and
are coupled to synchronous machines to generate utility-grade ac. If the water source is highly variable, it may
be  necessary  to  employ  variable-speed  operation.  If  the  speed  variations  are  not  large,  induction  generators
can be used. Special variable-speed constant-frequency (VSCF) generation schemes may be needed if the range
10%). Permanent magnet generators provide another alternative, especially if
of speed variations is large (> 
the output is to be rectiﬁed and stored for later use in the case of very small units.
