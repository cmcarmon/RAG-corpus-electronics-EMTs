examination of Equations 12.63 and 12.64, for example, with iL(0) = 0, shows
−1(α/ωd).
that the quadrature lead of vC with respect to iL is reduced by φ = tan
Nonetheless, the peaks of vC occur when iL is nearly zero, and vice versa. This
indicates that the energy is sloshing back and forth, stored first in the electric
field of the capacitor, and then in the magnetic field of the inductor. All under-
damped second-order systems have this property. A simple pendulum is an
obvious example. Here the exchange is between kinetic energy and potential
energy: The kinetic energy is maximum when the potential energy is zero, and
vice versa. We defer a more detailed analysis of the stored energy to Section 12.3.
As R → 0, that is, as the corresponding resistor approaches a short circuit,
it is apparent from Equations 12.44 and 12.60 that α → 0 and ωd → ω◦,
respectively. Therefore, as R → 0, remembering that ω◦ = 1/
LC, Equations
12.63 and 12.64 reduce to Equations 12.21 and 12.22, respectively. This is
expected because Figure 12.15 reduces to Figure 12.6 as R → 0. Limiting
behavior such as this can often be used to check the validity of an analysis.
