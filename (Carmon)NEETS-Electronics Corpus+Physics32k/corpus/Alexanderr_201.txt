Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b).
The  proof  of  Norton’s  theorem  will  be  given  in  the  next  section.
For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get 
and  We ﬁnd
In  fact,  from  what  we  know  about
RN
source transformation, the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal;
that is,
