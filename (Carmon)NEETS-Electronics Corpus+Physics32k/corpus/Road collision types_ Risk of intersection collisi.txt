The risk of intersection collisions differs on rural and urban roads, with around 50% of urban crashes and 30% of rural crashes occurring at junctions. In urban areas the likelihood of an intersection collision occurring is high as they typically have a higher density of junctions. On rural roads while the likelihood of a collision may be lower (because of fewer intersections) the outcome of the collision is often significantly worse because of the increased speeds involved.
Because intersection collisions often result in side-impacts they are therefore often fatal because people are seated close to the part of the car that provides little protection.
