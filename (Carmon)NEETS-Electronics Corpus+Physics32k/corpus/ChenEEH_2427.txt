Mp Using ^rr Vectors in Common Coordinates
Consider again the just described situation of aligned coordin-
ates for the two antennas of a communication link. However,
consider that the polarization unit vectors of the two antennas,
^rr1 and ^rr2, are expressed while the two antennas are placed in a
common coordinate system (r, u, f) with origin at the antenna
center:
