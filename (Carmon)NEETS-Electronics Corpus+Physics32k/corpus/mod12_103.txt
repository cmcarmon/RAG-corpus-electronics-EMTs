The use of a cw transmitter can be very simple. All that is required for the transmitter to work 
properly is a device to generate the oscillations, a method of keying the oscillations on and off, and an 
antenna to radiate the energy. Continuous wave was the first type of modulation used. It is still 
extensively used for long-range communications. When Marconi and others were attempting the transfer 
of intelligence between two points, without reliance on a conducting path, they employed the use of a 
practical coding system known as Morse code. You probably know that Morse code is a system of on-off 
keying developed for telegraph that is capable of passing intelligence over wire at an acceptable rate. 
Morse code consists only of periods of signal and no-signal.
