The blocking oscillator discussed is a free-running circuit. For a fixed prf, some means of stabilizing 
the frequency is needed. One method is to apply external synchronization triggers (figure 3-37), view (A) 
and view (B). Coupling capacitor C2 feeds input synchronization (sync) triggers to the base of Q1.
