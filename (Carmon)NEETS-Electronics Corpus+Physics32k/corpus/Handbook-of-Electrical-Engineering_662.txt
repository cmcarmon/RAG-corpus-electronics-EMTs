Multipath Performance of FM-DCSK
In  many  applications,  such  as  mobile  communications  or  indoor  radio,  the  transmitted  signal  arrives  at  the
receiver via multiple propagation paths with different delays, thus giving rise to multipath propagation. The
components arriving via different propagation paths may add destructively, resulting in deep frequency-selective
fading. Conventional narrow-band systems completely fail to operate if a multipath-related null (deÔ¨Åned below)
resulting from deep frequency-selective fading coincides with the carrier frequency. Because of the inherently
broad-band  nature  of  chaotic  signals,  chaotic  modulation  schemes  have  potentially  better  performance  in
multipath environments than narrow-band ones. In this section, the performance degradation of the FM-DCSK
scheme resulting from multipath propagation is determined by computer simulation.
