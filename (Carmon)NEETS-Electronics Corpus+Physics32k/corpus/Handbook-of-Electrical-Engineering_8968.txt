TouchPenâ„¢ was developed by Microtouch Systems, Inc., initially for use in GridPad made by the Grid Systems
Corp. It is essentially a high-resolution digitizer consisting of an all-glass tablet that can be used with a number
of  stylus  input  operating  systems  to  digitize  handwriting.  It  is  basically  a  touch  input  device  using  resistive
techniques to digitize the handwriting appearing on the display surface of pen-based computer systems. The
glass  tablet  is  placed  on  the  display  surface  and  the  system  pen  is  used  to  transmit  the  digitized  data  to  the
computer. As noted previously, the tablet may also be used as a standard touch input device.
