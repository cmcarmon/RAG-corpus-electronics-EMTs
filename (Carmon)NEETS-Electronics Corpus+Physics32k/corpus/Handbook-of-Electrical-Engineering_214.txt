An ideal voltage source is represented by the model of Fig. 2.9(b) with  RS = 0. An actual battery therefore
provides a close approximation of an ideal voltage source since the source resistance  RS is usually quite small.
An ideal current source is represented by the model of Fig. 2.9(c) with RS = Â¥. This is very closely represented
by the bipolar junction transistor (BJT).
