This page lists examples of magnetic induction B in teslas and gauss produced by various sources, grouped by orders of magnitude.
Note:
Traditionally, magnetizing field H, is measured in amperes per meter.
Magnetic induction B (also known as magnetic flux density) has the SI unit tesla [T or Wb/m2].
One tesla is equal to 104 gauss.
Magnetic field drops off as the cube of the distance from a dipole source.
