Section 7.6.2 showed that we could determine the valid range of amplifier
operation under the saturation discipline using the transfer curve of the amplifier.
Alternatively, we can solve for the same limits graphically from the load-line
and the MOSFET device characteristics as illustrated in Figure 7.40.
