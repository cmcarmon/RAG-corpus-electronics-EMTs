Nuclear power plants appeared after the Second World War. The major development occurred during the
sixties; however, by the eighties environmental considerations stopped plant development in the United States
and  slowed  it  down  all  over  the  world.  Presently,  the  future  of  nuclear  power  generation  is  unclear,  but  the
abundance of nuclear fuel and the expected energy shortage in the early part of the next century may rejuvenate
nuclear development if safety issues can be resolved.
