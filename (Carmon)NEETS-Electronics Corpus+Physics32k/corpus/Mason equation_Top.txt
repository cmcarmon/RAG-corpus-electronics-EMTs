The Mason equation is an approximate analytical expression for the growth (due to condensation) or evaporation of a water dropletâ€”it is due to the meteorologist B. J. Mason. The expression is found by recognising that mass diffusion towards the water drop in a supersaturated environment transports energy as latent heat, and this has to be balanced by the diffusion of sensible heat back across the boundary layer, (and the energy of heatup of the drop, but for a cloud-sized drop this last term is usually small).
