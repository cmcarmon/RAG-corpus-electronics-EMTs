For measurement purposes, the voltmeter used in a thermocouple circuit is designed to have
a very high resistance so as to avoid any error-inducing voltage drops along the thermocouple
wire. The problem of voltage drop along the conductor length is even more severe here than
with the DC voltage signals discussed earlier, because here we only have a few millivolts of
voltage produced by the junction. We simply cannot afford to have even a single millivolt of
drop along the conductor lengths without incurring serious temperature measurement errors.
Ideally, then, current in a thermocouple circuit is zero. Early thermocouple indicating in-
struments made use of null-balance potentiometric voltage measurement circuitry to measure
the junction voltage. The early Leeds & Northrup ”Speedomax” line of temperature indica-
tor/recorders were a good example of this technology. More modern instruments use semicon-
ductor ampliﬁer circuits to allow the thermocouple’s voltage signal to drive an indication device
with little or no current drawn in the circuit.
