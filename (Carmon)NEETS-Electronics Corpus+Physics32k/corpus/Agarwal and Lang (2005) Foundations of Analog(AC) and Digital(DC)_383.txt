Figures 2.66c and 2.66d depict the symbols for dependent voltage sources.
A dependent voltage source supplies a branch voltage that is a function of some
other signal within the circuit. Figure 2.66c shows a voltage-controlled voltage
source (VCVS) and Figure 2.66d shows a current-controlled voltage source
(CCVS). The guiding variable for a VCVS is a branch voltage, and that for a
CCVS is a branch current. The diamond shape of their symbols again indicates
that they are dependent sources, and the ± inside indicates that they are voltage
sources. The polarity the ± indicates the polarity of the sourced voltage and
the label next to the symbol indicates the value of the sourced voltage.
