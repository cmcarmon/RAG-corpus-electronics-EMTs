Resistance	is	classified	according	to	the	type	of	resistivity	that	it	can	contain,	along
with	the	amount	of	resistance	that	a	circuit	can	carry.	This	allows	the	opportunity
for	an	opposing	force	to	be	valued,	regardless	of	its	resistivity.	As	the	professional
electrical	engineers	can	attest,	not	every	circuit	component	that	produces	resistance
satisfies	the	rules,	particularly,	Ohmâ€™s	Law.
