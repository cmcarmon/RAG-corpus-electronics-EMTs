4. The  natural  response  of  an  RLC circuit  is  overdamped,  under-
damped, or critically damped, depending on the roots of the char-
acteristic  equation.  The  response  is  critically  damped  when  the
roots  are  equal  (
),  overdamped  when  the  roots

are  real  and  unequal  (
or 
the roots are complex conjugate (
