FORBIDDEN BANDâ€”The energy band in an atom lying between the conduction band and the valence
band. Electrons are never found in the forbidden band but may travel back and forth through it. The
forbidden band determines whether a solid material will act as a conductor, a semiconductor, or an
insulator.
