When relativistic effects are significant, the action of a point particle of mass m travelling a world line C parametrized by the proper time



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is




S
=
−
m

∫

τ
.


{\displaystyle S=-mc^{2}\int _{C}\,d\tau .}

If instead, the particle is parametrized by the coordinate time t of the particle and the coordinate time ranges from t1 to t2, then the action becomes





∫

t

t

{\displaystyle \int _{t1}^{t2}L\,dt,}

where the Lagrangian is

{\displaystyle L=-mc^{2}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}.}
