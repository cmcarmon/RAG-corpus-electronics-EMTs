Inch pedal is a standard pedal used in mobile machinery with a hydraulic pilot pressure output proportional to the pedal position, or an electronic pedal with a proportional electric signal output. The pedal is used in hydrostatic transmissions to temporarily affect the preset characteristics for hydrostatic gear ratio versus diesel engine rpm.
