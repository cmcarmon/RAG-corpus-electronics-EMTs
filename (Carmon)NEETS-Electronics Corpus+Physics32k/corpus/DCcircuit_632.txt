The terminal strip used in the prior example barely has enough terminals to mount all
seven resistors required for this circuit! It will be a challenge to determine all the necessary
wire connections between resistors, but with patience it can be done. First, begin by installing
and labeling all resistors on the strip. The original schematic diagram will be shown next to
the terminal strip circuit for reference:
