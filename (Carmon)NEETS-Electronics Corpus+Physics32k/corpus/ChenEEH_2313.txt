where the voltage and current are given by equations 4.37 and
4.38, respectively, and the asterisk denotes a complex conju-
gate. On a lossless line, since there is no dissipation, the
average power is independent of position z. Therefore, the
voltage and current in equation 4.57 can be calculated at any
point along the line. Using the conditions at the load in
equations 4.37 and 4.38, it follows that:
