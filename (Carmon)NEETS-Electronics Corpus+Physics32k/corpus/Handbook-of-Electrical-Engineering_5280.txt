The output of a PV system is dc and inversion is required for supplying ac loads or for utility-interactive
operation. While the required fuel input to a conventional power plant depends on its output, the input to a
PV system is determined by external factors such as cloud cover, time of day, season of the year, geographic
location, orientation, and geometry of the collector. Therefore, PV systems are operated, as far as possible, at
or near their maximum outputs. Also, PV plants have inertialess generation and are subject to rapid changes
in their outputs due to moving clouds.
