USCT systems designed for medical imaging of soft tissue typically aim for resolution in order of centimeters to millimeters and require therefore ultrasound waves in the order of mega-hertz frequency. This requires typically water as low-attenuating transmission medium between ultrasound transducers and object to retain suitable sound pressures.
USCT systems share with the common tomography the fundamental architectural similarity that the aperture, the active imaging elements, surround the object. For the distribution of ultrasound transducers around the measurement object, forming the aperture, multiple design approaches exist. There exist mono-, bi- and multistatic setups of transducer configurations. Common are 1D- or 2D- linear arrays of ultrasound transducers acting as emitters on one side of the object, on the opposing side of the object a similar array acting as receiver is placed, forming a parallel setup. Sometimes accompanied with the additional ability to be moved to gather more information from additional angles. While cost efficient to build the main disadvantage of such an setup is the limited ability (or inability) of gathering reflectivity information, as such an aperture is limited to only transmission information. Another aperture approach is a ring of transducers, sometimes with the degree of freedom of motorized lifting for gathering additional information over the height for 3D imaging ("stacking"). Full 3D setups, with no inherent need for aperture movements, exist in form of apertures formed by semi-spherical distributed transducers. While the most expensive setup they offer the advantage of nearly-uniform data, gathered from many directions. Also, they are fast in data taking as they don't require time-costly mechanical movements.
