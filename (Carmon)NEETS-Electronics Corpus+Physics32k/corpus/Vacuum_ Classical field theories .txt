The strictest criterion to define a vacuum is a region of space and time where all the components of the stressâ€“energy tensor are zero. It means that this region is empty of energy and momentum, and by consequence, it must be empty of particles and other physical fields (such as electromagnetism) that contain energy and momentum.
