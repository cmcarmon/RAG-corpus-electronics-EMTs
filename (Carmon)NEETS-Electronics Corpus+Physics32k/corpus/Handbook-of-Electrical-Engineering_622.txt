Unlike periodic waveforms, chaotic basis functions are inherently nonperiodic and are different in each interval
of  duration  T.  Chaotic  basis  functions  have  the  advantage  that  each  transmitted  symbol  is  represented  by  a
unique analog sample function, and the correlation between chaotic sample functions is extremely low. How-
ever, it also produces a problem associated with estimating long-term statistics of a chaotic process from sample
functions of Ô¨Ånite duration.
