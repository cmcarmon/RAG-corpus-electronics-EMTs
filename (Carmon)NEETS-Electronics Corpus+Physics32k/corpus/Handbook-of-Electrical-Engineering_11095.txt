Although not used or approved for use in the United States, the German “Magnetodyn” system [Kraus, 1984]
is interesting not only because it employs sinusoidal magnetic ﬁelds between 2 and 20 Hz but also because it
relies on metallic implants that are used for ﬁxation of the bone to act as the “secondary” of a “transformer”
whose primary is the external applicator. Sometimes an implanted pickup coil (“secondary”) is connected to
ﬁxation bars or to screws (electrically insulated from the bars) on each side of a pseudoarthrotic gap. With this
system, peak electric ﬁelds of 40 V/m and current densities of 5 A/m2 have been produced in the gap.
