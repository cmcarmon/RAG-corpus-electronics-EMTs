Estimation and Tracking
Measurement Error Sources
Radars  measure  target  range  and  angle  position  and,  potentially,  Doppler  frequency.  Angle  measurement
performance  is  emphasized  here  since  the  corresponding  cross-range  error  dominates  range  error  for  most
practical applications. Target returns are generally smoothed in a tracking Ô¨Ålter, but tracking performance is
largely determined by the measurement accuracy of the subject radar system. Radar measurement error can be
characterized as indicated in Table 41.7.
