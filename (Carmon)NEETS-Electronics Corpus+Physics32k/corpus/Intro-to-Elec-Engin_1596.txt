Figure 16.1.9 shows a single-phase dcâ€“ac converter, known as an inverter, in which the output
voltage is controlled by varying the conduction time of transistors. Note that the voltage is of
alternating form when transistors Q1 and Q2 conduct for one-half period and Q3 and Q4 conduct
for the other half.
