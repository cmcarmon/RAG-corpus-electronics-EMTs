For each competition UKRoC teams have had to design, construct and successfully launch a rocket to carry one or more raw medium size hen's egg as close to a specified altitude, for a specific flight time, then return the egg and altimeter payload section safely, and undamaged to earth using a specified means of deceleration.
Many teams choose to design their rockets on simulation programs, such as Spacecad and RockSim, which not only enable them to design, but also calculate how well a rocket will perform in different weather conditions.
