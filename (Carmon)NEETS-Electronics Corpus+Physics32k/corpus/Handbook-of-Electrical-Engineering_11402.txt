In principle a measurement of fD, when f, c, and q are known, will yield the speed of the target vt. However, it
is often difﬁcult to determine q because the angle the transducer axis makes with a blood vessel, for example,
is often unknown. Even when that angle is known, the ﬂow is not necessarily along the direction of the vessel
at every location and for all times. Time domain detection of motion, by measuring the movement of speciﬁc
echoes from one pulse to another, is a recently developed alternative to Doppler detection that is not currently
widely used.
