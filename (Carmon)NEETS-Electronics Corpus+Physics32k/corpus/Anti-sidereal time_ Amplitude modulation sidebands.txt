Cosmic rays received on Earth exhibit daily variations in amplitude in solar time due to the distribution of cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere and to the Compton-Getting effect caused by Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun. Other daily variations in amplitude in sidereal time are caused by the anisotropy in the direction from which cosmic rays are received relative to the plane of our Milky Way galaxy. Both are contaminated by an annual seasonal variation. The daily solar variation is amplitude modulated by the seasonal variation of one cycle/year, producing sidebands on either side of the solar frequency, about 365 cycles/year, of 365−1=364 cycles/year and 365+1=366 cycles/year. Similarly, an annual amplitude modulation of one cycle/year of the sidereal frequency, about 366 cycles/year, produces sidebands of 366−1=365 cycles/year and 366+1=367 cycles/year. The upper sideband of the solar frequency contaminates the amplitude of the sidereal frequency, while the lower sideband of the sidereal frequency contaminates the amplitude of the solar frequency. Because the magnitudes of the two sidebands produced by amplitude modulation of the solar frequency are the same and no known natural phenomenon recurs at 364 cycles/year, the spurious amplitude at the sidereal frequency can be corrected by subtracting any signal present at the anti-sidereal frequency. Similarly, the spurious amplitude in the solar frequency of 365 cycles per year can be corrected by subtracting any signal present at the extended-sidereal frequency of 367 cycles per year.
