Each read/write head is shaped from a ferromagnetic material with an air gap 1 mm wide as seen in Fig. 80.18.
The writing head is concerned with converting an electrical pulse into a magnetic state and can be magnetized
in one of two directions. This is done by passing a current through the magnetic coil which sets up a leakage
ﬁeld across the 1-mm gap. When the current is reversed the ﬁeld across the gap is changed, reversing the polarity
of the magnetic ﬁeld on the tape. The head magnetizes the passing magnetic tape recording the state of the
magnetic ﬁeld in the air gap. A logic 1 is recorded as a change in polarity on the tape, and a logic 0 is recorded
as no change in polarity, as seen in Fig. 80.19. Reading the magnetic tape states from the tape and converting
them to electrical signals is done by the read head. The bit sequences in Fig. 80.19 show the change in magnetic
