The predicate part speciﬁes the constraint (invariant) of a
deﬁnition or the precondition (subformulas without dashed
variables) and postcondition (subformulas containing dashed
variables) of some processing in terms of ﬁrst-order logic
formulas. Subformulas on separate lines in the predicate part
are conjoined by default. The predicate thus deﬁnes the prop-
erty of the schema.
