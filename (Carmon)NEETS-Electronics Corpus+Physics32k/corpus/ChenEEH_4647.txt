The preceding result represents the key analytical device for
the synthesis of LPV controllers satisfying prespeciﬁed ampli-
tude performance constraints. Gain-scheduled controller syn-
thesis is accomplished in an iterative fashion: perform a line
search for values of a > 0, solving (at each a) the synthesis
conditions of equations 9.18 through 9.20 for the required
matrices and/or the required performance level, g. When the
required performance has been achieved, the LPV controller is
formed from the realization in equation 9.21.
