The Borda–Carnot equation gives the decrease in the constant of the Bernoulli equation. For an incompressible flow the result is – for two locations labelled 1 and 2, with location 2 downstream to 1 – along a streamline:

with
p1 and p2 the pressure at location 1 and 2,
z1 and z2 the vertical elevation – above some reference level – of the fluid particle, and
g the gravitational acceleration.
The first three terms, on either side of the equal sign are respectively the pressure, the kinetic energy density of the fluid and the potential energy density due to gravity. As can be seen, pressure acts effectively as a form of potential energy.
In case of high-pressure pipe flows, when gravitational effects can be neglected, ΔE is equal to the loss Δ(p+½ρv2):
