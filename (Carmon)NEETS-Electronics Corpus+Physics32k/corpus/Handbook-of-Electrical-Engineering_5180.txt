Structural Engineering Applications
Figure  58.4  illustrates  a  smart  vibration  control  strategy  in  structural  beams.  Normally,  the  parent  beam  is
made  of  conventional  materials,  and  its  vibrational  characteristics  are  decided  by  the  elastic  behavior  of  the
constituent materials. Suppose a smart material is imbedded in the test beam. This material could be one of
the  types  indicated  in  Fig.  58.2.  A  vibration  sensor  yields  an  electric  output  proportional  to  the  vibration.
Suppose the dynamic response of the beam (as observed at the output of the sensor) deviates from the desired
characteristics. Then an error signal can be generated, which in turn can be used to develop an optimal control
signal and this control signal can be fed back to the smart material whose elastic behavior is then altered as a
function  of  the  control  input.  As  a  result,  the  vibration  characteristics  of  the  entire  (parent)  structure  are
modiÔ¨Åed, or the system is dynamically tuned in an adaptive manner.
