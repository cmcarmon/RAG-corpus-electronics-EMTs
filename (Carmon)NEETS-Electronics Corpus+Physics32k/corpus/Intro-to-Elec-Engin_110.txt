Voltmeter
In order to measure the potential difference between two terminals or nodes of a circuit, a voltmeter
is connected across these two points. A practical voltmeter can usually be modeled as a parallel
combination of an ideal voltmeter (through which no current ﬂows) and a shunt resistance RV, as
shown in Figure 1.4.1. The internal resistance RV of an ideal voltmeter is inﬁnite, while its value
in practice is of the order of several million ohms. There are what are known as dc voltmeters
and ac voltmeters. An ac voltmeter usually measures the rms value of the time-varying voltage.
