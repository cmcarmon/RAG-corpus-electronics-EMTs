P-Persistent CSMA
The p-persistent CSMA algorithm takes a moderate approach
between nonpersistent and 1-persistent CSMA. It speciﬁes a
value;
transmission after detecting the
medium is idle. The station ﬁrst checks if the medium is idle,
transmits a frame with the probability P if it is idle, and delays
one time unit of maximum propagation delay with 1-P. If the
medium is busy, the station continues to listen until the
channel is idle and repeats the same procedure when the
medium is idle. In general, at the heavier load, decreasing P
would reduce the number of collisions. At the lighter load,
increasing P would avoid the delay and improve the utilization.
The value of P can be dynamically adjusted based on the trafﬁc
load of the network.
