If an impulsive burn of Δv is performed at periapsis in a parabolic orbit then the velocity at periapsis before the burn is equal to the escape velocity (Vesc), and the specific kinetic energy after the burn is:









e

k

V

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}e_{k}&={\frac {1}{2}}V^{2}\\[4pt]&={\frac {1}{2}}(V_{\text{esc}}+\Delta v)^{2}\\[4pt]&={\frac {1}{2}}V_{\text{esc}}^{2}+\Delta vV_{\text{esc}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\Delta v^{2}\end{aligned}}}

where



V

{\displaystyle V=V_{\text{esc}}+\Delta v}

When the vehicle leaves the gravity field, the loss of specific kinetic energy is:






1

V

esc


2




{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}V_{\text{esc}}^{2}}

so it retains the energy:




Δ

V

esc

Δ

v

{\displaystyle \Delta vV_{\text{esc}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\Delta v^{2}}

which is larger than the energy from a burn outside the gravitational field (

Δ

v

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\Delta v^{2}}
) by:




Δ
v

V

esc




{\displaystyle \Delta vV_{\text{esc}}}

When the vehicle has left the gravity well, it is travelling at a speed of




V
=

{\displaystyle V=\Delta v{\sqrt {1+{\frac {2V_{\text{esc}}}{\Delta v}}}}}

For the case where the added impulse Δv is small compared to escape velocity, the 1 can be ignored and the effective delta v of the impulsive burn can be seen to be multiplied by a factor of simply:








2

V

esc




Δ
v






{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\frac {2V_{\text{esc}}}{\Delta v}}}}

Similar effects happen in closed and hyperbolic orbits.
