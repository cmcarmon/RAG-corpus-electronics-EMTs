L/C, it becomes a signifi-
cant open circuit between the capacitor and inductor. In this way it absorbs the
oscillating voltage that the capacitor and inductor share for smaller values of
R. As a consequence, the energy exchange between the capacitor and inductor
is interrupted, and the circuit ceases to oscillate. Instead, its behavior is more
like that of an independent capacitor and an independent inductor discharging
through the resistor. To see this, let us determine the asymptotic values of s1
and s2 as R becomes large and hence as Î± becomes large. They are
