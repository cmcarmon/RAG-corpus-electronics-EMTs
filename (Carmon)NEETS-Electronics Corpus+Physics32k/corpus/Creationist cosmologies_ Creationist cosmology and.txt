The young Earth creationist website Answers in Genesis dismisses the Big Bang as "entirely fiction", "nothing more than an attempt by men ... to try and explain how they think we might have been created without a Creator."
One of the most common creationist criticisms of the Big Bang concerns the horizon problem and supposed problems with the inflationary theory of the early universe. Creationists have claimed that dark matter and dark energy are doubtful concepts invented by Big Bang theorists in order to uphold the theory. Creationists also point to the Baryon asymmetry problem, i.e., that the big bang is expected to have produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter.
