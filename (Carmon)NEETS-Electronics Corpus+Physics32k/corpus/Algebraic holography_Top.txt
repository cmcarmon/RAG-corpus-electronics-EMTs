Algebraic holography, also sometimes called Rehren duality, is an attempt to understand the holographic principle of quantum gravity within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory, due to Karl-Henning Rehren. It is sometimes described as an alternative formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence of string theory, but some string theorists reject this statement [1]. The theories discussed in algebraic holography do not satisfy the usual holographic principle because their entropy follows a higher-dimensional power law.
