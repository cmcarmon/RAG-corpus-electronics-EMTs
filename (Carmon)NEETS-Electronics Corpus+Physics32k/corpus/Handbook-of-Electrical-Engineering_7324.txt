The speciﬁc steps used to design a PLL depend on the intended application. Typically the architecture of the
loop  will  be  determined  by  the  output  frequency  agility  required  (frequency  synthesizer)  and  the  reference
sources available. Other requirements such as size and cost play important factors, as well as available standard
components. Once the topology has been determined, then the desired loop transfer function must be synthe-
sized.  This  may  be  dictated  by  noise  requirements  as  discussed  above  or  other  factors  such  as  loop  lock-up
time or input signal tracking ability. The design Eqs. (76.11) through (76.15) may then be used to determine
the component values required in the loop ﬁlter.
