The Mesh Current Method, also known as the Loop Current Method, is quite similar to the
Branch Current method in that it uses simultaneous equations, Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, and
Ohm’s Law to determine unknown currents in a network. It differs from the Branch Current
method in that it does not use Kirchhoff’s Current Law, and it is usually able to solve a circuit
with less unknown variables and less simultaneous equations, which is especially nice if you’re
forced to solve without a calculator.
