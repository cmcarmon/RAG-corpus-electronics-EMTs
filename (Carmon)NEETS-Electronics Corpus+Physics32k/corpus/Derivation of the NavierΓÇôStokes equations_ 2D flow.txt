The true utility of this formulation is seen when the flow is two dimensional in nature and the equation is written in a general orthogonal coordinate system, in other words a system where the basis vectors are orthogonal. Note that this by no means limits application to Cartesian coordinates, in fact most of the common coordinates systems are orthogonal, including familiar ones like cylindrical and obscure ones like toroidal.
The 3D flow velocity is expressed as (note that the discussion has been coordinate free up till now):





u

=

u

1




e


1


+

u

e


2

u

3




e


3




{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =u_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+u_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}+u_{3}\mathbf {e} _{3}}

where





e


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{i}}
are basis vectors, not necessarily constant and not necessarily normalized, and




u

i




{\displaystyle u_{i}}
are flow velocity components; let also the coordinates of space be



(

x

1


,

x

2


,

x

3


)


{\displaystyle (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})}
.
Now suppose that the flow is 2D. This doesn't mean the flow is in a plane, rather it means that the component of flow velocity in one direction is zero and the remaining components are independent of the same direction. In that case (take component 3 to be zero):





u

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u_{1}}{\partial x_{3}}}={\frac {\partial u_{2}}{\partial x_{3}}}=0}

The vector function






ψ
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\psi }}}
is still defined via:





u

=
∇
×



ψ
→





{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }}}

but this must simplify in some way also since the flow is assumed 2D. If orthogonal coordinates are assumed, the curl takes on a fairly simple form, and the equation above expanded becomes:

{\displaystyle u_{1}\mathbf {e} _{1}+u_{2}\mathbf {e} _{2}={\frac {\mathbf {e} _{1}}{h_{2}h_{3}}}\left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{2}}}\left(h_{3}\psi _{3}\right)-{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{3}}}\left(h_{2}\psi _{2}\right)\right]+{\frac {\mathbf {e} _{2}}{h_{3}h_{1}}}\left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{3}}}\left(h_{1}\psi _{1}\right)-{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{1}}}\left(h_{3}\psi _{3}\right)\right]+{\frac {\mathbf {e} _{3}}{h_{1}h_{2}}}\left[{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{1}}}\left(h_{2}\psi _{2}\right)-{\frac {\partial }{\partial x_{2}}}\left(h_{1}\psi _{1}\right)\right]}

Examining this equation shows that we can set

{\displaystyle \psi _{1}=\psi _{2}=0}
and retain equality with no loss of generality, so that:

the significance here is that only one component of






ψ
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\psi }}}
remains, so that 2D flow becomes a problem with only one dependent variable. The cross differentiated Navier–Stokes equation becomes two 0 = 0 equations and one meaningful equation.
The remaining component




ψ

=
ψ


{\displaystyle \psi _{3}=\psi }
is called the stream function. The equation for



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
can simplify since a variety of quantities will now equal zero, for example:

if the scale factors




h

{\displaystyle h_{1}}
and




h

2




{\displaystyle h_{2}}
also are independent of




x

{\displaystyle x_{3}}
. Also, from the definition of the vector Laplacian

Manipulating the cross differentiated Navier–Stokes equation using the above two equations and a variety of identities will eventually yield the 1D scalar equation for the stream function:

where




∇

4




{\displaystyle \nabla ^{4}}
is the biharmonic operator. This is very useful because it is a single self-contained scalar equation that describes both momentum and mass conservation in 2D. The only other equations that this partial differential equation needs are initial and boundary conditions.

The assumptions for the stream function equation are listed below:
The flow is incompressible and Newtonian.
Coordinates are orthogonal.
Flow is 2D:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial h_{1}}{\partial x_{3}}}={\frac {\partial h_{2}}{\partial x_{3}}}=0}
, otherwise extra terms appear.
The stream function has some useful properties:
Since

{\displaystyle -\nabla ^{2}{\vec {\psi }}=\nabla \times (\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }})=\nabla \times \mathbf {u} }
, the vorticity of the flow is just the negative of the Laplacian of the stream function.
The level curves of the stream function are streamlines.
