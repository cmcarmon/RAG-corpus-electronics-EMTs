High-voltage substations typically have at least two busses: one
at one voltage level and the other at a different voltage level
with power transformer(s) connecting them. In high-voltage
substations, the breaker-and-a-half arrangement, shown earlier
in Figure 9.3, is used to provide a redundant bus connection at
each voltage level. In addition, in some substation arrange-
ments, there is a provision for separating one portion of the
bus from another, allowing for independent operation of
the two segments. All of those conﬁgurations are important
when deﬁning the bus protection requirements (Blackburn,
1998).
