If  time  is  critical,  the  simpler  models  will  deﬁnitely  be  much  faster  for  use  in  characterization.  The  more
complicated  models  require  more  measurements  over  wider  ranges  of  voltages  as  well  as  wider  ranges  of
geometries. This, coupled with the larger number of parameters, means they will take some time with which
to work. The BSIM2 model will take longer than all the rest, especially if the Gds ﬁtting parameters are to be used.
The  characterization  results  may  need  to  be  used  in  more  than  one  circuit  simulator.  For  example,  if  a
foundry must supply models to various customers, they may be using different circuit simulators. In this case
proprietary models applicable to a single circuit simulator should not be used. Also, circuit designers may want
to check the circuit simulation results on more than one circuit simulator. It is better to use standard Berkeley
models (level 2, level 3, BSIM, BSIM2, and BSIM3) in such cases.
