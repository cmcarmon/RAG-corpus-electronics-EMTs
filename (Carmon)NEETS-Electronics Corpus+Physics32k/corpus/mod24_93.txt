Reflected waves are simply those waves that are neither transmitted nor absorbed, but are reflected
from the surface of the medium they encounter. When a wave approaches a reflecting surface, such as a
mirror, the wave that strikes the surface is called the incident wave, and the one that bounces back is
called the reflected wave (refer to figure 2-4). An imaginary line perpendicular to the point at which the
incident wave strikes the reflecting surface is called the normal, or the perpendicular. The angle between
the incident wave and the normal is called the angle of incidence. The angle between the reflected wave
and the normal is called the angle of reflection.
