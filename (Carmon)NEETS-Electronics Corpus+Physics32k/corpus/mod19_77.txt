The average adult body contains about 5 quarts (4.75 liters) of blood. One pint of blood can usually 
be lost without harmful effectÂ—in fact, this is the amount usually given by blood donors. However, the 
loss of 2 pints (.95 liter) will usually cause shock; shock becomes greater and greater as the amount of 
blood loss increases (shock will be discussed later in this chapter). If half the blood in the body is lost, 
death almost always results.
