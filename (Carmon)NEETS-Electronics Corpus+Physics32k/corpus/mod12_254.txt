FSK SIGNALS.â€”In fsk the rf signal is shifted in frequency (not amplitude) between "key-open"
and "key-closed" conditions. The signal amplitude remains essentially constant. View (A) of figure 2-3
represents the letter "F" keyed as a shift in frequency between mark and space. The normal frequency
condition with the key open is a space. Recall that this may be either the lower or higher frequency. When
the key is closed, the frequency instantly changes to the mark value and remains constant during the
marking interval. Opening the key again returns the frequency to the space frequency. Midway between
the mark and space frequencies is the assigned channel frequency.
