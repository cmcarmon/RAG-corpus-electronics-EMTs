Global concerns and regulations associated with environmental issues are increasingly affecting the manu-
facturing and design of the electronics industry. Environmental management standards, “take back” programs,
ISO  14000  standards  development  activity,  and  eco-label  requirements  represent  a  sample  of  the  initiatives
driving the industries move to more environmentally efﬁcient practices. While the industry has initiated some
activities to address environmental concerns, the future competitiveness of the industry will depend on improve-
ments  in  environmental  technology  in  manufacturing,  accurate  assessment  of  the  environmental  impact  of
products  and  process,  and  design  products  that  employ  design  for  environment,  reuse,  and  recycleability.
Industrial ecology offers a framework for analyzing the environmental effects of the electronics industry which
is complicated by the rapid pace of change.
