(cid:1) The frequency response characterizes the behavior of a network as a func-
tion of frequency. Frequency domain analysis of a network is carried out by
examining the networkâ€™s system function, which is the ratio of the complex
amplitude of the network output to the complex amplitude of the input.
(cid:1) A frequency response plot is a convenient way of summarizing how a
network behaves as function of frequency. A frequency response plot has
two graphics:
