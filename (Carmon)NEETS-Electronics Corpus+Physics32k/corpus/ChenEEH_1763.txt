Need for Higher Bandwidth
Multimedia applications require signiﬁcantly higher band-
widths than conventional textual applications of the past.
Moreover, media streams are transmitted using UDP that
does not have any mechanism to control congestion. The
communication network must be able to handle such high
bandwidth requirements without being unfair to other con-
ventional ﬂows. Table 7.5 summarizes the bandwidth require-
ments of
some common audio/video media types. We
discussed several compression schemes that take advantage of
spatial/temporal redundancy present in audio/video media,
but the compressed media still requires signiﬁcantly higher
bandwidth than what is typically required for text-oriented
services. Moreover, compression schemes cannot be expected
to be used for all multimedia transmissions. There are two
types of compression techniques: lossy and lossless. The lossy
compression techniques eliminate redundant
information
from data and subsequently introduce distortion or noise in
the original data. The lossless compression techniques do
not loose any information, and data received by the user is
exactly identical to the original data. Lossy compression usu-
ally yields signiﬁcantly higher compression ratios than lossless
