Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman.
In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density:




m

∼

ρ

α




{\displaystyle m_{\text{eff}}\sim \rho ^{\alpha }}
, where



α
≃
1


{\displaystyle \alpha \simeq 1}
.
Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external magnetic field.
Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons.
