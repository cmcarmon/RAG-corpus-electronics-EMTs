It is possible to deﬁne sixth-rank and higher-order electrostriction coupling coefﬁcients. The electrostriction
tensor  can  also  be  treated  as  a  complex  quantity,  similar  to  the  dielectric  and  the  piezoelectric  tensors.  The
imaginary part of the electrostriction is also a fourth-rank tensor. Our discussion is conﬁned to the real part
of the quadratic electrostriction tensor.
