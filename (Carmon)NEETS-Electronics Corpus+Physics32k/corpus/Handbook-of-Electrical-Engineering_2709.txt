The sliced-bisection method has two phases. In the Ô¨Årst phase, the layout area is iteratively divided into a
certain number of almost equal subareas in the same direction. In this way, we end up with a set of slices [see
Fig. 25.18(b)].  Similarly,  the  second  phase  divides  the  area  into  a  certain  number  of  subareas;  however,  the
slicing is done in the opposite direction.
