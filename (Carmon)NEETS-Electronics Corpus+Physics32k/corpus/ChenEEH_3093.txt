Equation 4.3 represents a standing wave. The sine term describes
the time variation, while the cosine term describes the space
variation. P is the number of pole pairs around the machine.
At a Ô¨Åxed point on the wave u is constant, and the amplitude is
sinusoidally time varying. The peak of the wave and the nodes or
zero crossings, however, are always located at the same position.
This equation is contrasted with an expression of the form:
