ratio Z =
This quantity is known as the element’s impedance.
The impedance is, in general, a complex-valued, frequency-dependent quantity. For example, the magni-
tude of the capacitor’s impedance is inversely related to frequency, and has a phase of −π/2. This observation
means that if the current is a complex exponential and has constant amplitude, the amplitude of the voltage
decreases with frequency.
