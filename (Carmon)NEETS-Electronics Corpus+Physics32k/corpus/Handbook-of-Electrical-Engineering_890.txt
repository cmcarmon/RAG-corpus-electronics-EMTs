The IC itself contains a voltage reference source and operational ampliﬁer. Simple models for these elements
are used here rather than representing them in their full form, using transistors, to illustrate model development.
The use of simpliﬁed models can also greatly reduce the simulation effort. (For example, the simple op amp
used here requires only eight nodes and ten components, yet realizes many advanced features.)
