This is the quenched product of sulfur melts above 160 °C (at this point the properties of the liquid melt change remarkably, e.g. large increase in viscosity). Its form changes from an initial plastic form gradually to a glassy form, hence its other names of plastic, glassy or vitreous sulfur. It is also called χ-sulfur. It contains a complex mixture of catena-sulfur forms mixed with cyclo-forms.
