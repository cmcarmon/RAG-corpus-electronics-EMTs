When the tube conducts, current flows from the battery through Rk to the cathode, through the tube
to the plate, and through RL to the positive terminal of the battery. The current flowing through Rk will
cause a voltage drop across Rk. The bottom of Rk goes negative while the top goes positive. This positive
voltage at the top of Rk makes the cathode positive relative to the grid.
