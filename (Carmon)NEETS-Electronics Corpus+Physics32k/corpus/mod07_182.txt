SHELLS and SUBSHELLS are the orbits of the electrons in an atom. Each shell can contain a
maximum number of electrons, which can be determined by the formula 2n 2. Shells are lettered K
through Q, starting with K, which is the closest to the nucleus. The shell can also be split into four
subshells labeled s, p, d, and f, which can contain 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively.
