in developing ”high-temperature” superconductors which superconduct at warmer tempera-
tures. One type is a ceramic mixture of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen which transitions
at a relatively balmy -160o Celsius. Ideally, a superconductor should be able to operate within
the range of ambient temperatures, or at least within the range of inexpensive refrigeration
equipment.
