In  trying  to  identify  60-Hz  sources  to  eliminate  or  minimize  their  effect,  it  is  sometimes  useful  to  use  a
 resistor attached to the electrodes. An ampliﬁer output represents only
dummy source, such as a ﬁxed 100-k
contributions from interfering sources. If noise can be reduced to an acceptable level (at least by a factor of 10
less than EEG signals) under this condition, one is likely to obtain uncontaminated EEG records.
