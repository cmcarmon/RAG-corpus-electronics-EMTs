Figure 8.20 indicates how the proposed FDA framework
reacts to the false alarm situation caused by unknown noises.
Once the contaminated measurements trigger the alarm, the
system behavior is immediately examined by failure diagnosis,
and, since the measurements are contaminated by noises, it
will not be recognized as any one of the anticipated failures.
