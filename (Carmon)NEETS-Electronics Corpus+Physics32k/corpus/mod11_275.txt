In this chapter you will study the general characteristics of microwave antennas that are widely used 
in radar and communications applications. The basic principles of operation of microwave antennas are 
similar to those of antennas used at lower frequencies. You might want to review the principles presented 
in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas, at this 
time. Pay particular attention to basic antenna principles in chapter 4 for a review of microwave antennas.
