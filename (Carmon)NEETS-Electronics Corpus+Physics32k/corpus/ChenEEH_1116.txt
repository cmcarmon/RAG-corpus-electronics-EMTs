The third and most important and relevant data on reliabil-
ity of engineering components and systems in general and
MEMS in particular is user ﬁeld data. In the mid-1990s,
signiﬁcant data of this kind only existed on micromachined
pressure sensors. Manifold air pressure sensors had already
proven to be reliable in automobile engines, and disposable
blood pressure sensors also operated satisfactorily in their one-
time uses. The situation for reliability data on MEMS used by
customers has changed quantitatively since the middle of the
last decade, as indicated in Figure 6.6. Tens of millions of
MEMS devices, most notably air bag triggers in cars and
micromirrors in conference room projectors, have proven to
be remarkably reliable. It is now possible to make quantitative
estimates of the reliability of some major MEMS devices in use
by large numbers of customers.
