ics), and the rest consist of both hardware and software (specif-
ically, the software drivers for the actuators and sensors).
Each of these components can be represented entirely by a
software model;
for example, the vehicle dynamics could
be replaced by a simulation for modeling purposes. The
resulting modeled software components could be applied
in numerous aircraft ﬂight control systems, demonstrating
the reusability of software components. Finally, some of the
links shown in the ﬁgure may be made along a communication
network, so these components may be described as distributed
components.
