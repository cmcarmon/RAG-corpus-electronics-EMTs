DSP starter kits (DSK) are inexpensive development systems available from TI and based on both the ﬁxed-
point  TMS320C50  and  the  ﬂoating-point  TMS320C31  processors.  We  will  discuss  both  the  ﬁxed-point
TMS320C25  and  the  ﬂoating-point  TMS320C30  digital  signal  processors,  including  the  development  tools
available for each of these processors and DSP applications.
