  Since the core permeability is not inﬁnite, not all of the ﬂux created by a given winding current will
be conﬁned to the core. The part that escapes the core and seeks out parallel paths in surrounding
structures and air is referred to as 
Also, since the core permeability is not inﬁnite, the magnetic ﬁeld intensity inside the core is not zero.
Therefore, some current ﬂow is necessary to provide this small H. The path provided in the circuit
for this “magnetizing” current is through Xm. The core has internal power losses, referred to as core
loss, due to hystereses and eddy current phenomena. The effect is accounted for in the resistance Rc.
Sometimes Rc and Xm are neglected.
