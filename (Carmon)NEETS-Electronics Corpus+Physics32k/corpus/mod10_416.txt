The rigid coaxial line consists of a central, insulated wire (inner conductor) mounted inside a tubular
outer conductor. This line is shown in figure 3-6. In some applications, the inner conductor is also tubular.
The inner conductor is insulated from the outer conductor by insulating spacers or beads at regular
intervals. The spacers are made of Pyrex, polystyrene, or some other material that has good insulating
characteristics and low dielectric losses at high frequencies.
