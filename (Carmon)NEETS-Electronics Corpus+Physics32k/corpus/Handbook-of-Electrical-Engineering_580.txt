For F0 = 5, Fp/3 = 3.8, Fp/2 = 3.2, F2p/3 = 2.7, Fp = 1, Y0 = 3.17, Y1 = 1.7, Y2 = –0.1, Y3 = 0.3, Y4 = –0.07, and
HD2 = 5.9%, HD3 = 17.6%. This particular method allows calculation of HD3 and also gives a better estimate
of HD2. To obtain higher-order harmonics a detailed Fourier series analysis is required and for such applications
a circuit simulator, such as SPICE, should be used.
