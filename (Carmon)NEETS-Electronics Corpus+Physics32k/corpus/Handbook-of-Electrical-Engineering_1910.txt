Based  on  the  above  assumptions,  a  workplan  was  generated  to  have  the  MPEG-4  Committee  Draft  (CD)
completed  in  1997  to  provide  a  generic  audio  visual  coding  standard  at  very  low  bit  rates.  Several  MPEG-4
seminars  were  held  in  parallel  with  the  WG11  meetings,  many  workshops  and  special  sessions  have  been
organized, and several special issues have been devoted to such topics. However, as of July 1994 in the Norway
WG11 meeting, there was still no clear evidence that a “quantum leap” in compression technology was going
to happen within the MPEG-4 timeframe. On the other hand, ITU-T has embarked on an effort to deﬁne the
H.263  standard  for  videophone  applications  in  PSTN  and  mobile  networks.  The  need  for  deﬁning  a  pure
compression standard at very low bit rates was, therefore, not entirely justiﬁed.
