To minimize fuel consumption, the engine should operate at
a low speed; however, low idle speed could induce large engine
speed variations or even cause the engine to stall in the pres-
ence of torque disturbances. Hence, a suitable control
law
should keep the idle speed as low as possible while minimizing
