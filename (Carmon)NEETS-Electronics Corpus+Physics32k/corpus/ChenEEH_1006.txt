Ideally, the static power consumption of static CMOS circuits
is assumed to be zero, as the PMOS and the NMOS devices are
never on simultaneously in steady-state operation. But in
reality, the drain current through the CMOS transistor does
not drop to zero once the gate voltage goes below the threshold
voltage. There is, unfortunately, always a leakage current,
which is primarily determined by the fabrication technology.
Historically, the contribution of the static power dissipation to
the overall power dissipation is in general very small and can
be ignored. However, with the current technologies, for which
reductions in the device threshold voltage are employed for
achieving better performance, the percentage of the static
power dissipation from the total power has increased as
shown in Figure 5.11.
