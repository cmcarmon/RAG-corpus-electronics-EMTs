Some systems are designed for extremely high availability. For example, the computers used by AT&T to control
its  telephone  exchanges  are  designed  for  an  availability  of  0.9999999,  which  corresponds  to  an  unplanned
downtime of 2 min in 40 years. In order to achieve this level of availability, fault tolerant techniques have to
be used from the design stage, accompanied by a high level of monitoring and maintenance.
