Resistance and reactance together determine the magnitude and phase of the impedance through the following relations:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|Z|&={\sqrt {ZZ^{*}}}={\sqrt {R^{2}+X^{2}}}\\\theta &=\arctan {\left({\frac {X}{R}}\right)}\end{aligned}}}

In many applications, the relative phase of the voltage and current is not critical so only the magnitude of the impedance is significant.
