Increasing Disk Density
As described in the ﬁrst section, the improvements in disk recording density are likely to continue. Higher bit
densities  are  achieved  through  a  combination  of  the  use  of  thinner  ﬁlms  on  the  disk  platters  (e.g.,  densities
improve from 16,000 bpi to 21,000 bpi when thick iron oxide is replaced with thin ﬁlm materials), smaller gaps
between the poles of the read/write head’s electromagnet, and heads which ﬂy closer to the disk surface.
