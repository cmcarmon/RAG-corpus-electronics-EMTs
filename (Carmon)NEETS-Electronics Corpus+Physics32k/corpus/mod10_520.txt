As shown in view D, the amplitude varies along the length of the line. In this case it is zero at the
end and center but maximum at the one-fourth and three-fourths points. The entire diagram of the open-
ended line conditions is shown in view E. The standing waves of voltage and current appear together.
Observe that one is maximum when the other is minimum. The current and voltage standing waves are
one-quarter cycle, or 90 degrees, out of phase with one another.
