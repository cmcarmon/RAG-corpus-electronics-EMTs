The element j^rri  ^rrRj is called the polarization match factor
between the incident wave and the receiving antenna. It can be
shown that the polarization match factor is at the maximum
possible (unity) only when gi ¼ gr , zi ¼ zr , and ARi ¼ ARr
(ai ¼ aR, bi ¼ bR). From equations 6.70 and 6.77, one can see
that the above condition established when ^rri ¼ ^rr
R. Other pos-
sible practical situations may be considered. First, for a given
receiving antenna (given zr and ARr ), a given incident plane
wave (given zi and ARi), and a given load impedance ZL, the
receive power PL can be maximized by just turning the antenna
about the ^rr axis, such that the major axes of the incident and
receive polarization vectors are aligned (gi ¼ gR). Second, every
