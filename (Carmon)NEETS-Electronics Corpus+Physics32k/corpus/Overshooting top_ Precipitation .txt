A storm powerful enough to produce a lasting overshooting top will have the following:
Heavy rain; a deluge of rain could fall from this storm in a short amount of time.
Strong wind; the storm clouds have powerful winds churning inside them. These winds are likely to be felt at the surface as well, possibly in the form of a tornado.
Hail; if the updraft is strong enough to produce an overshooting top it can also carry large hail.
Lightning; this is sure to be a thunderstorm.
