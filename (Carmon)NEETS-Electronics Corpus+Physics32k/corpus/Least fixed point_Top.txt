In order theory, a branch of mathematics, the least fixed point (lfp or LFP, sometimes also smallest fixed point) of a function from a partially ordered set to itself is the fixed point which is less than each other fixed point, according to the set's order. A function need not have a least fixed point, and cannot have more than one.
For example, with the usual order on the real numbers, the least fixed point of the real function f(x) = xÂ² is x = 0 (since the only other fixed point is 1 and 0 < 1). In contrast, f(x) = x+1 has no fixed point at all, let alone a least one, and f(x)=x has infinitely many fixed points, but no least one.
