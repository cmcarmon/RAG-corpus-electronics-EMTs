Figure 12.3 shows the resulting closed-loop behavior, plot-
ted in a solid line with circles, and the bottom plot in Figure
12.4 corresponds to the control input generated by the second
design. Although it cannot be seen from Figure 12.3, the
convergence to zero is about twice as fast with the second
design than with the ﬁrst one, taking less than 4 secs for x1
and x2 to become small enough, versus about 8 sec with the
ﬁrst design. Furthermore, there is now no overshoot for x1.
Note that in the second design, x2 reaches a slightly larger value
