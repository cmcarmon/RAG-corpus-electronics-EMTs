Cycloidal drives are not typically backdrivable, although some commercially produced drives can be backdriven. However, the required torque to backdrive may vary depending on the design of the drive.
Due to the eccentric nature of the drive, if the cycloidal disk is not balanced by a second disk or a counterweight, it will generate vibration which will propagate through the driven shafts. This will cause increased wear on the exterior teeth of the cycloidal disk, as well as component bearings.
