Body image is a subjective picture of one’s own physical appearance established both by self-awareness and by noting the reactions of others. Preoccupation with body image and the physical appearance of one’s body denotes how much value one ascribes to their phenotypical traits. Body image may be valued highly, and more often than not, dissatisfaction with one’s own body image perverts that value with other social effects.
