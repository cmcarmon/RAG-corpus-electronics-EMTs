MANUAL TELEGRAPHY.â€”In manual telegraphy, the most widely used code is the Morse code. 
In this code, two distinctive signal elements are employed-the dot and the dash. The difference between a 
dot and a dash is its duration, a dash being three times as long as a dot. Each character is made up of a 
number of dots and/or dashes. The dot and dash elements making up any character are separated from 
each other by a time interval equal to the duration of one dot. The time interval between the characters for 
each word is equal to the duration of three dots. The interval between words is equal to seven dots. (A 
signal-man uses the Morse code to send visual flashing-light messages. The radioman uses the Morse 
code to send messages electrically.)
