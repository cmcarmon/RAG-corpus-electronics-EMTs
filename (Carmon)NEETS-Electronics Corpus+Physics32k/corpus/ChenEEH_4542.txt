fault isolation problem. Existence conditions for the L matrices
were Ô¨Årst studied by Prasad (Prasad and Reiss, 1970) and later
by Singh (1972) who have shown that the existence of L
matrices is a reasonable assumption. This is essentially the
same type of assumption that one makes when assuming that
the state equations of a system exist. As seen above, if the
components in the system are integrators, then the L matrices
are precisely the state matrices.
