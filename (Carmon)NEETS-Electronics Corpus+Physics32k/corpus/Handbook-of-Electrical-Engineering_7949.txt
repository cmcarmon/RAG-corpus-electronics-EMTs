where A, B, and C are the inputs. The Ô¨Årst equation has four product terms, or products; the second has three.
A PLA enables functions expressed in this form to be directly implemented. Each product term is generated
by a gate which can be programmed to form the AND of any subset of the inputs and their complements, while
subsets of products can be summed in a set of programmable OR gates. The programmable gates are constructed
in the form of arrays, with the input lines being orthogonal to the product lines, which are themselves orthogonal
to the output lines, as shown in Fig. 81.42.
