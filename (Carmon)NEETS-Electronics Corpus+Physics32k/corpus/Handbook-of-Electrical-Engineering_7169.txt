The attitude determination and control system (ADCS) must maintain the proper angular orientation of the
satellite in its orbit in order to keep the antennas pointed to the earth and the solar arrays aimed toward the
sun (for example). The two prevalent stabilization methods are spin stabilization and body stabilization. In the
former,  the  satellite  body  spins  and  the  angular  momentum  maintains  gyroscopic  stiffness.  The  latter  uses
momentum wheels to keep the spacecraft body orientation ﬁxed. Components of this subsystem include the
momentum wheels, torquers (which interact with the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld), gyros, sun and earth sensors, and
thrusters to maintain orientation.
