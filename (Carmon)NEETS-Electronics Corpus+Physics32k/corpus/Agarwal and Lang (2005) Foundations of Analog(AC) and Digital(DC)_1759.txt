In this example we evaluate the step response of the circuit shown in Figure 12.29 with
R = 50 , L = 20 mH, and C = 13 pF. Assume that vIN steps from 0 to V◦ at t = 0,
where V◦ = 1 V. In other words, vIN = V◦u(t) = u(t) V, where u(t) is the unit step
function. Let us suppose that we are interested in obtaining iL, vR, vC, and vL.
Following Equations 12.123, 12.124, and 12.127, respectively, this circuit is character-
ized by α = 1.25 krad/s, ω◦ = 62.017 krad/s, and ωd = 62.005 krad/s.
