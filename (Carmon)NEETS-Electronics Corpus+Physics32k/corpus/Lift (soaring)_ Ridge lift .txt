Ridge lift, or Orographic lift, is caused by rising air on the windward side of a slope. Ridge lift is used extensively by sea birds and by aircraft. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft.
With winds of 20 to 25 knots (46 km/h), it is possible for aircraft to soar at an altitude up to twice the height of the obstacle. Ridge lift can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun.
