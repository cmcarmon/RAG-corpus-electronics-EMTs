At times it is convenient to use the word "ICE" to recall to mind the phase relationship of the current 
and voltage in capacitive circuits. I is the symbol for current, and in the word ICE it leads, or comes 
before, the symbol for voltage, E. C, of course, stands for capacitor. This memory aid is similar to the 
"ELI" used to remember the current and voltage relationship in an inductor. The phrase "ELI the ICE 
man" is helpful in remembering the phase relationship in both the inductor and capacitor.
