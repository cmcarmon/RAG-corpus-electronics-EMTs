The monthly journals IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory Techniques, IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave
Letters, and IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation publish articles on modeling and design of micro-
wave passive circuit components. Articles in the ﬁrst two journals are more circuit and component oriented
while  the  third  focuses  on  ﬁeld  theoretic  analysis.  These  are  published  by  The  Institute  of  Electrical  and
Electronics  Engineers,  Inc.  For  subscription  or  ordering  contact:  IEEE  Service  Center,  445  Hoes  Lane,
