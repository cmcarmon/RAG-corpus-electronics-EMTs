FDDI
The FDDI is similar to a token ring LAN except that two rings, instead of one, may be used. Stations needing
high-reliability communication are connected to both rings. In the case of a break in the rings the network can
be automatically reconﬁgured. FDDI rings operate at 100 Mbps with a maximum of 500 nodes and a maximum
ﬁber  length  of  200  km.  In  fact,  most  actual  FDDI  installations  have  only  a  small  number  of  nodes  (such  as
routers). There is an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard for FDDI.
