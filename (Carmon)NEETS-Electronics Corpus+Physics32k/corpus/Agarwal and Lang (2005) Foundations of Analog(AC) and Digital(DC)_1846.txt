We wish to show in this chapter that the solution to linear circuit problems
is greatly simplified by assuming a drive of the form est as illustrated in the center
panel of Figure 13.1, primarily because under this assumption the differential
equation is transformed into an algebraic equation, and because the response
to a sinusoidal drive can be directly obtained from the response to the est drive.
This leads further to a shorthand solution method involving the concept of
impedance, whereby the algebraic equation can be found directly from the
circuit model, without writing the differential equation at all, as diagrammed in
the lowermost panel of the Figure 13.1.
The insight behind the employment of a drive of the form est, where s = jω,
is the following: Recall, we wish to find the system response in the steady
state1 to a sinusoidal input of the form cos(ωt). We will show that directly
solving system differential equations with a sinusoidal input leads to a tangle of
trigonometry and is very complicated. (You have already seen an example of a
direct solution of an RL circuit for a sinusoidal drive in Section 10.6.7.) Instead,
we employ the following mathematical trick: Realizing that
