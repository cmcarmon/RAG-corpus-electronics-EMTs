Local dehydrators depend on the ship's lp air for an inlet supply, while the local compressor-
dehydrators can operate independently of the ship's air supply. Some units of electronic equipment that 
have local dehydrator units are pressure interlocked within the dehydrator unit. When the outlet air 
pressure is below a set value, the interlock prevents the equipment from going to a full OPERATE 
condition. When the central dry-air system is used, the pressure interlock is bypassed.
