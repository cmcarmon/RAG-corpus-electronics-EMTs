13.2.5 The stator and rotor of a three-phase, 440-V,
15-hp, 60-Hz, eight-pole, wound-rotor induction
motor are both connected in wye and have the
following parameters per phase: R1 = 0.5 ,
R2 = 0.1 , Xl1 = 1.25 , and Xl2 = 0.2 .
The magnetizing impedance is 40  and the core-
loss impedance is 360 , both referred to the sta-
tor. The ratio of effective stator turns to effective
rotor turns is 2.5. The friction and windage losses
total 200 W, and the stray-load loss is estimated
as 100 W. Using the equivalent circuit of Figure
13.2.5(a), calculate the following values for a
slip of 0.05 when the motor is operated at rated
voltage and frequency applied to the stator, with
the rotor slip rings short-circuited: stator input
current, power factor at the stator terminals, cur-
rent in the rotor winding, output power, output
torque, and efÔ¨Åciency.
