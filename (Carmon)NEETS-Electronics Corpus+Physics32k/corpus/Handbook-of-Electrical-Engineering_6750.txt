Monitoring and controlling the LAN are essential elements of station management. By monitoring the media,
stations  maintain  a  record  of  important  measurements,  such  as  the  number  of  a  speciﬁc  type  of  packet
transmitted or received, the number of different kinds of errors, and the source addresses of received packets.
Such measurements are made available to an application in the station or to a management center. Thus are
applications  able  to  monitor  and  collect,  correlate,  and  act  upon  key  LAN  statistics.  Likewise,  designated
applications  are  able  to  effect  changes  in  the  LAN  by  writing  to  speciﬁc  variables  within  stations,  which
collectively comprise the so-called management information base. For instance, station management informs
the MAC sublayer of its unique LAN address by writing the value to a special MAC register.
