The basic circuit of the standard TTL family is typiﬁed by the two-input NAND gate shown in Fig. 79.8(a).
To estimate the operating levels of voltage and current in this circuit, assume that any transistor in saturation
has VCE = 0.2 and VBE = 0.75 V. Let drops across conducting diodes also be 0.75 V and transistor current gains
(when  nonsaturated)  be  about  50. As  a  starting  point,  let  the  voltage  levels  at  both  inputs A  and  B  be  high
enough that T1 operates in the reversed mode. In this case the emitter currents of T1 are negligible, and the
current  into  the  base  of  T1  goes  out  the  collector  to  become  the  base  current  of  T2.  This  current  is  readily
calculated by observing that the base of T1 is at 3 · 0.75 = 2.25 V so there is a 2.75-V drop across the 4-kW
resistor. Thus IBI = IB2 = 0.7 mA, and it follows that T2 is saturated. With T2 saturated, the base of T3 is at VC
+ VBE4 = 0.95 V. If T4 is also saturated, the emitter of T3 will be at VD3 + VCE4 = 0.95 V, and T3 will be cut off.
The voltage across the 1.6-kW resistor is 5 – 0.95 = 4.05 V, so the collector current of T2 is about 2.5 mA. This
means the emitter current of T2 is 3.2 mA. Of this, 0.75 mA goes through the 1-kW resistor, leaving 2.45 mA
as the base current of T4. Since the current gain of T4 is about 50, it will be well into saturation for any collector
current less than 100 mA, and the output at C is a logic 0. The corresponding minimum voltage levels required
at the inputs are estimated from VBE4 + VECI, or about 1.7 V.
