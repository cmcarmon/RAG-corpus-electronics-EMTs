Other  synchronous  machine  models,  besides  that  given  in  Table  66.3,  are  used  in  power  system  analysis.
Typically, when the network is large and the phenomenon of interest is somewhat localized in nature, machines
further away from the action can be represented by simpler models to save computation time. On the other
hand, certain phenomena may require an even more sophisticated model than that given in Table 66.3. Canay
[1993] described reﬁnements in both the rotor circuit representation and the method of parameter determi-
nation to obtain a closer ﬁt of the rotor variables. For studying shaft torsion, the damper circuit representation
should  not  be  ignored.  In  transient  stability  studies,  machines  beyond  the  ﬁrst  two  neighborhoods  of  the
disturbance can be represented by progressively simpler models with distance from the disturbance. Ignoring
just the pψ
e in the stator equations will yield a so-called subtransient
model of two orders less than the above given model. Further simpliﬁcation by setting pψ′
kd to zero
or omitting the damper winding equations will yield a so-called transient model of another two orders less.
Finally, setting pψ ′
f  to zero and holding ﬁeld ﬂux linkage constant yields the constant ﬁeld ﬂux linkage model.
Signiﬁcant savings in computing time can also be made by neglecting the subtransient and transient saliency
of the machine. When rotor saliency is ignored, the effective stator impedances along the rotor’s qr and dr axes
are equal. In other words, the stator impedance in the synchronously rotating reference frame of the network
will not be a function of rotor angle. Because its value need not be updated with the rotor angle at each time
step of the dynamic simulation, the constant stator impedance of this model can be absorbed into the network’s
admittance or impedance representation.
