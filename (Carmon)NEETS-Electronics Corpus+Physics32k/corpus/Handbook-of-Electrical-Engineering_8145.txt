I claim as my invention:
1. In combustion, a cathode ray image transmitting tube provided with an electrode in the form of a mosaic
photosensitive target and with means for developing a ray of electrons and directing the ray at a surface of
said target for scanning the same, a lens system for focusing an optical image of an object on the scanning
portion of the surface of the target, such portion of said surface being concave toward the lens system with
the curvature corresponding substantially to that of an imaginary spherical surface on which the lens system
is able to focus the optical image sharply.
