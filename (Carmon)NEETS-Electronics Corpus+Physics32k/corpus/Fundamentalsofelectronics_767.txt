At the speed of light, a signal travels across the United States in 16 ms, a reasonably small time delay. If a
lossless (zero space constant) coaxial cable connected the East and West coasts, this delay would be two to
three times longer because of the slower propagation speed.
6.5 Line-of-Sight Transmission6
Long-distance transmission over either kind of channel encounters attenuation problems. Losses in wireline
channels can be compensated by repeaters can extend the distance between transmitter and receiver beyond
what passive losses the wireline channel imposes. In wireless channels, not only does radiation loss occur
(p. 201), but also one antenna may not “see” another because of the earth’s curvature.
