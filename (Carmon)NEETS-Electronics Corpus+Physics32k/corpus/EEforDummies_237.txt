Figure 4-17 is a photograph of a 1980’s style dimmer switch circuit. This 
simple electronic device uses just a few components to control current flow 
to a built‐in light fixture in my house. But most electronic systems are a lot 
more complicated than this; they connect lots of individual components in 
one or more circuits to achieve their ultimate goal.
