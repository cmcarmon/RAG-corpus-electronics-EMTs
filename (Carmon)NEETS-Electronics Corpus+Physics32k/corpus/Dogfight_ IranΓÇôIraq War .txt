In the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988 (also known as first Gulf War) many dogfights happened between Iranian Air Force and Saddam Hussein's Iraq Air Force. At early years of the war IRIAF had the superiority (see for example Operation Sultan 10 and Operation Morvarid); however, at the end of the war, Iranian Air Force lost its superiority due to the lack of their western made aircraft spare parts and outdated equipment, while Iraq was introducing new French and Soviet weapons in its air force.
The Iran–Iraq War also saw the only confirmed helicopter dogfights in history, with Iranian Army Aviation's AH-1J Internationals (usually the TOW-capable ones) entering combat against Iraqi Army Air Corps' Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships. Hinds are stronger and faster, while AH-1Js are more agile. The result of the skirmishes are disputed. There were even engagements between Iranian AH-1J and Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft: the AH-1Js scored three confirmed kills against MiG-21s, claimed a Su-20, and shared in the destruction of a MiG-23—all using their 20 mm calibre canon.
