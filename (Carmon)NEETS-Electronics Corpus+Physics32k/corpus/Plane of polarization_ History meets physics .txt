The "vibrations" identified by Fresnel were taken as tangential to the wavefronts.:8,9 In electromagnetic terms, that identifies the direction of vibration as the D direction. In a double-refracting crystal, it was conventional to take the wave-normal direction as the propagation direction to be included in the plane of polarization.:20 So the plane of polarization was normal to the wavefront. As the vibration was in both the plane of vibration and the plane tangential to the wavefront, both planes being normal to the plane of polarization, it followed that the plane of polarization was simply the plane normal to the vibration.:9 In electromagnetic terms, that identifies the plane of polarization as simply the plane normal to D.
Hence the old and new definitions of the plane of polarization may be stated succinctly and precisely as follows:
Under the old definition, the plane of polarization is the plane normal to the D field.
Under the new definition, the plane of polarization is the plane normal to the B field.
The former definition implies that the plane of polarization contains the magnetic vectors; the latter implies that it contains the electric vectors.
As the new electromagnetic theory further emphasized the electric vibrations (because of their interactions with matter), whereas the old "plane of polarization" contained the magnetic vectors, the new theory would have tended to reinforce the convention that the plane of vibration was normal to the plane of polarization â€” but only if one was familiar with the historical definition of the plane of polarization. If one was influenced by physical considerations alone, then, as Feynman and the Britannica illustrate, one would pay attention to the electric vectors, assume that the "plane" of polarization (if one needed such a concept) contained those vectors, and not bother to define a separate "plane of vibration". Moreover, it is not clear that a "plane of polarization" is needed at all: knowing what field vectors are involved, we can specify the polarization by specifying the orientation of a particular vector.
