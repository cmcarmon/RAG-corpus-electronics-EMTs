Transformer Connections
A single-phase transformer has one input (primary) winding and one output (secondary) winding. A conven-
tional three-phase transformer has three input and three output windings. The three windings can be connected
in  one  of  several  different  conÔ¨Ågurations  to  obtain  three-phase  connections  that  are  distinct.  Each  form  of
connection has its own merits and demerits.
