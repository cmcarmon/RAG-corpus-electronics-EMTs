Under the first two constraints, elements do not interact with each other
except through their terminal currents and voltages. Notice that the first two
constraints require that the rate of change of magnetic flux outside the elements
and net charge within the elements is zero for all time.8 It directly follows that
the magnetic flux and the electric fields outside the elements are also zero.
Thus there are no fields related to one element that can exert influence on
the other elements. This permits the behavior of each element to be ana-
lyzed independently.9 The results of this analysis are then summarized by the
