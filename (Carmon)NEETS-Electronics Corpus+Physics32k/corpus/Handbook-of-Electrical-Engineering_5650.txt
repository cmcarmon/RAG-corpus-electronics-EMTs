2. Transient stability programs. Transient stability programs are used to study power systems under dis-
turbance  conditions  to  predict  whether  synchronous  generators  remain  in  synchronism  and  system
stability  is  maintained.  System  disturbances  can  be  caused  by  the  sudden  loss  of  a  generator  or  a
transmission line, by sudden load increases or decreases, and by short circuits and switching operations.
The stability program combines power-ﬂow equations and generator dynamic equations to compute the
angular swings of machines during disturbances. The program also computes critical clearing times for
network faults and allows the planning engineer to investigate the effects of various network modiﬁca-
tions, machine parameters, disturbance types, and control schemes.
