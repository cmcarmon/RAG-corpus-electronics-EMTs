A steady current I flowing along a path ℓ will exert a force on nearby charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by I on a nearby charge q with velocity v is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ),}

where B(r) is the magnetic field, which is determined from I by the Biot–Savart law:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{4\pi }}\int {\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times d{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}{r^{2}}}.}

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a vector potential, A(r):

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )=\nabla \times \mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )}

Gauss's law for magnetism in integral form is

{\displaystyle \iint \mathbf {B} \cdot d\mathbf {S} =0,}

while in differential form it is

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {B} =0.}

The physical interpretation is that there are no magnetic monopoles.
