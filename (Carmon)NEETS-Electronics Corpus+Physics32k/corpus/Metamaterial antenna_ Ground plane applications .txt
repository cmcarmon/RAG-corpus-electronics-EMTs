Metamaterials employed in the ground planes surrounding antennas offer improved isolation between radio frequency, or microwave channels of (multiple-input multiple-output) (MIMO) antenna arrays. Metamaterial, high-impedance groundplanes can also improve radiation efficiency and axial ratio performance of low-profile antennas located close to the ground plane surface. Metamaterials have also been used to increase beam scanning range by using both the forward and backward waves in leaky wave antennas. Various metamaterial antenna systems can be employed to support surveillance sensors, communication links, navigation systems and command and control systems.
