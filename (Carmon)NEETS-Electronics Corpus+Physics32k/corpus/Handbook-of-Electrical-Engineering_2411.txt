Effective mass: The apparent mass of an electron or hole with respect to acceleration in an electric ﬁeld.
Electrical  thickness: The “thickness”  of  a  layer  in  which  the  current  actually  ﬂows.  In  a  thin  sample,  this
dimension may be much less than the physical thickness of the sample because some of the charge carriers
may be immobilized at surface and interface states.
