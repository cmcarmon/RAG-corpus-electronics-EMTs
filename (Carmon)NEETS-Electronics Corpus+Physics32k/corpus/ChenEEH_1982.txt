A similar method is implicit signature checking (Patel and
Fung, 1983), which assigns unique signatures to each basic
block by using the blockâ€™s start address, and obtaining an
implicit signature checking point at the beginning of each
block. Justifying signatures are embedded at each branch
instruction.
