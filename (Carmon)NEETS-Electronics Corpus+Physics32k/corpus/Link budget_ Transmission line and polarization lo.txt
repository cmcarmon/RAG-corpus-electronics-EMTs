In practical situations (Deep Space Telecommunications, Weak signal DXing etc. ...) other sources of signal loss must also be accounted for
The transmitting and receiving antennas may be partially cross-polarized.
The cabling between the radios and antennas may introduce significant additional loss.
Fresnel zone losses due to a partially obstructed line of sight path.
Doppler shift induced signal power losses in the receiver.
