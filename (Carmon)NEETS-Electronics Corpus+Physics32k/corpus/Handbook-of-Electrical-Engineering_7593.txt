More recently, a much faster CMOS has appeared and carries the designations 74ACxx and 74ACTxx. These
operate in the same supply voltage range and bear the same relationship with TTL as the HCMOS. The driving
capabilities (characterized by IOH and IOL) of this series are much greater, such that they can be fanned out to
10 low-power Schottky inputs.
