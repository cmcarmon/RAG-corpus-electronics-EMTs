Sodium only loses one electron, so its charge is +1 in the above example. If an atom loses
more than one electron, the resulting charge can be indicated as +2, +3, +4, etc. or by a Roman
numeral in parentheses showing the oxidation state, such as (I), (II), (IV), etc. Some atoms can
have multiple oxidation states, and it is sometimes important to include the oxidation state in
the molecular formula to avoid ambiguity.
