recording.  Furthermore,  because 
signal 
processing  may  use  digital  rather  than  analogue 
signals an additional stage of analogue-to-analogue 
conversion may be required.  
  Figure  16.1(b)  shows  the  arrangement  of  a 
control  system.  This  uses  negative  feedback  in 
order  to  regulate  and  stabilize  the  output.  It  thus 
becomes possible to set the input or demand (i.e. 
what  we  desire  the  output  to  be)  and  leave  the 
system  to  regulate  itself  by  comparing  it  with  a 
signal  derived  from  the  output  (via  a  sensor  and 
appropriate signal conditioning). 
  A comparator is used to sense the difference in 
these  two  signals  and  where  any  discrepancy  is 
detected  the  input  to  the  power  amplifier  is 
adjusted  accordingly.  This  signal  is  referred  to  as 
an error  signal (it should be zero when the output 
exactly matches the demand). The input (demand) 
is  often  derived  from  a  simple  potentiometer 
connected across a stable d.c. voltage source whilst 
the  controlled  device  can  take  many  forms  (e.g.  a 
d.c. motor, linear actuator, heater, etc.).
