Titan Technologies of Edmonton, AL, Canada, was the ﬁrst to bring to market a product using the
technology  when  they  introduced  storage-tank  ﬂuid  sensors  incorporating  the  system.  The  new  radar
allowed Titan to reduce its devices from the size of an apple crate to the size of a softball, and to sell
them for one-third the cost of a comparable device. The Federal Highway Administration is preparing
to use the radar for highway inspections and the Army Corps of Engineers has contracted with LLNL to
use the system for search and rescue radar. Other applications include a monitoring device to check the
heartbeats  of  infants  to  guard  against  Sudden  Infant  Death  Syndrome  (SIDS),  robot  guide  sensors,
automatic  on/off  switches  for  bathroom  hand  dryers,  hand-held  tools,  automobile  back-up  warning
systems, and home security.
