The equations in Section 6.2.7 may be used here to determine
the various parameters of the incident wave. The major and
minor axes ai and bi, axial ratio ARi, tilt angle gi, the rotation
parameter zi, and the phase angle ai should be replaced for the
corresponding variables in Section 6.27: a, b, AR, g, z, and a,
respectively. However, it may be noted that, in contrast with
equation 6.29, equation 6.70 has a negative sign before zi. This
takes into account the propagation of the incident wave in the
-^rr direction instead of the þ^rr direction of propagation for the
outgoing radiated ﬁeld. The change in the direction of propa-
gation, by deﬁnition, automatically switches the ‘‘handedness’’
(right- or left-hand) of the wave.
