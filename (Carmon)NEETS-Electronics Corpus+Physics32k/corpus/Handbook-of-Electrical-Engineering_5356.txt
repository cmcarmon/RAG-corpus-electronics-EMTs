III-V Semiconductors
Semiconductors such as GaAs, GaAlAs, GaInAsP, InSb, and InP have been receiving attention for photovoltaics
because  they  have  exceptional  characteristics  that  offer  energy  conversions  exceeding  one  third  of  the  sun’s
energy. Although cost is the overriding consideration for terrestrial applications, some compelling arguments
can be made for their use in concentrators. Space markets have expanded for these materials, since solar cell
cost has been less a factor compared to performance. Because of the ability to adjust the electro-optical properties
(e.g.,  bandgap),  these  materials  lend  themselves  extremely  well  to  multiple  bandgap  cell  designs.  Fig. 60.11
presents structures for two-, three-, and four-terminal approaches. Solar cells in the 30 to 34% efﬁciency range
have  been  realized  for  these  structures,  and  research  continues  in  order  to  bring  about  better  performances
with  lower  complexities  [Friedman,  1998].  There  has  been  some  recent  attention  directed  toward  the  two-
terminal, two-junction tandem — with the best efﬁciency of 30.3% under non-concentrator conditions. While
these robust performing solar cells boast the highest efﬁciencies, the cost demands for terrestrial markets are
still impeding their acceptance in competition with other approaches. Dominant issues include:
