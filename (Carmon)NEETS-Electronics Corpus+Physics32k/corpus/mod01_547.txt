This principle is illustrated in figure 3-35, where the internal resistance of a battery is shown as Ri. In
the schematic, the internal resistance is indicated by an additional resistor in series with the battery. The
battery, with its internal resistance, is enclosed within the dotted lines of the schematic diagram. With the
switch open, the voltage across the battery terminals reads 15 volts. When the switch is closed, current
flow causes voltage drops around the circuit. The circuit current of 2 amperes causes a voltage drop of 2
volts across Ri. The 1-ohm internal battery resistance thereby drops the battery terminal voltage to 13
volts. Internal resistance cannot be measured directly with a meter. An attempt to do this would damage
the meter.
