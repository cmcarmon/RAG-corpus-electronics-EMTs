Aside from the switching application in telecommunications, there also is the high-speed laser modulation
application. Using an external LiNbO3-based optic intensity modulator, both analog and digital data transmis-
sion systems have been demonstrated. Analog transmission systems using integrated optic devices are partic-
ularly attractive as remote antenna links because of their high speed and ability to be driven directly by the
received signal without ampliﬁcation. Recently, the use of high-power diode-pumped YAG lasers operating at
1300  nm  and  external  intensity  modulators  based  on  LiNbO3  have  found  wide  application  in  the  cable  TV
industry. In addition, the ability of the Mach–Zehnder intensity modulator to control intensity with a controlled
wavelength change (i.e., chirp) has allowed its use in long-haul telecommunications systems.
