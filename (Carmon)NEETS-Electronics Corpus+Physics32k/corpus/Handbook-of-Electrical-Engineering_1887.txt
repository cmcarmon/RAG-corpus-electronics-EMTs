Practical video signal processors are not pure VLIW machines, however. In general, they are in fact hybrid
machines  that  use VLIW  processing  for  some  operations  and  heterogeneous  multiprocessing  techniques  for
others. This is necessary to meet the high performance demand on video processing; certain critical operations
can be sped up with special-purpose function units, leaving the VLIW processor to perform the rest. An example
