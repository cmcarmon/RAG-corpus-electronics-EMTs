A common type of crystal-diode test set is a combination ohmmeter-ammeter. Measurements of
forward resistance, back resistance, and reverse current can be made with this equipment. Using the
results of these measurements, you can determine the relative condition of these components by
comparing their measured values with typical values obtained from test information furnished with the
test set or from the manufacturerâ€™s data sheets. A check that provides a rough indication of the rectifying
property of a diode is the comparison of the back-and-forward resistance of the diode at a specified
voltage. A typical back-to-forward-resistance ratio is on the order of 10 to 1, and a forward-resistance
value of 50 to 80 ohms is common.
