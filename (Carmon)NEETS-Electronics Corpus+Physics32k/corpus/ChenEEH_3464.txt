frequency deviation, and subsynchronous oscillations. The
conditions of hazardous operation are loss of prime mover
(better known as generator motoring), inadvertent energiza-
tion causing a nonsynchronized connection, overload, out-
of-step or loss of synchronism, and operation at unallowed
frequencies.
