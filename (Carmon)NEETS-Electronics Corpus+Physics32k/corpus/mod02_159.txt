The working voltage of the capacitor is the maximum voltage that can be steadily applied without
danger of breaking down the dielectric. The working voltage depends on the type of material used as the
dielectric and on the thickness of the dialectic. (A high-voltage capacitor that has a thick dielectric must
have a relatively large plate area in order to have the same capacitance as a similar low-voltage capacitor
having a thin dielectric.) The working voltage also depends on the applied frequency because the losses, and
the resultant heating effect, increase as the frequency increases.
