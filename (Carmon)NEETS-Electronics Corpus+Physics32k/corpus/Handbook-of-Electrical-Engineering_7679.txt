Bipolar designs frequently incorporate circuit consolidation unavailable in FET technology, such as the multi-
emitter cell shown in Fig. 80.4(a). Here one of the two lower emitters is normally forward biased, turning one
inverter on and the other off for bistability. The upper emitters can be used either to extract a differential signal
