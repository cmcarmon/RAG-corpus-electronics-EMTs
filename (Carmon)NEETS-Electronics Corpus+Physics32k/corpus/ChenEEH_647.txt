decomposition is implemented by using full adder (FA) arrays.
For all moduli, the FA-based AUms are shown to execute much
faster as well as have much smaller hardware complexity and
time-complexity products than ROM-based general multi-
pliers. Since the AUms use full adders as their basic units, they
lead to modular and regular designs, which are inexpensive and
easy to implement in VLSI.
