The basis of any monitoring and diagnostics system is the underlying maintenance philosophy. Micropro-
cessor controls make it possible to capture any combination of information from the intelligent subsystems.
Information  can  then  be  processed  and  presented  in  a  variety  of  ways,  along  with  data  from  analog  sensors
which are not part of any intelligent system.
