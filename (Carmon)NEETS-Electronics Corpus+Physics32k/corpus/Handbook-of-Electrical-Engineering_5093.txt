The diagonal elements r11 and r22 can be calculated by Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcients and Snell’s law. The off-
diagonal elements r12 and r21 can be derived from the magnetooptic permittivity tensor, the applied magneti-
zation and Maxwell equations with the use of appropriate boundary conditions [Arecchi and Schulz-DuBois,
1972]. It is important to note that all the elements of the reﬂectance matrix rij are dependent on the angle of
incidence between the incident light and the magnetooptic ﬁlm surface.
