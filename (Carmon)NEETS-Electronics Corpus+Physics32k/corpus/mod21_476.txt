From the preceding definitions of percentage of modulation, you should note that methods of 
measuring all three types of modulation percentages must be devised. When differing values are obtained, 
however, the cause may not necessarily be directly related to unequal positive and negative peaks of a 
complex modulation wave. Another possibility is distortion caused by carrier shift. Distortion may also be 
produced by effects other than the modulation process â€” for example, parasitic oscillation, nonlinear 
radio-frequency amplification of modulated signals, and distortion present in the audio amplifiers.
