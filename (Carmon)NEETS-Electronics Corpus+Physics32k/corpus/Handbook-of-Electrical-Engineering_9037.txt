Piezoelectric  Ink-Jet  Printing.  Piezoelectric  ceramic  transducers  are  employed  with  this  technology.  These
materials (e.g., lead zirconate titanate and barium titanate), when polarized, change their physical dimensions
when subject to an electric ﬁeld—usually applied through surface electrodes. Deﬂections of several angstroms
per volt are typical. When the transducer is pulsed with a voltage, the deﬂection generates a pressure wave in
an adjacent ink chamber, resulting in the ejection of a single drop—hence the descriptors, “impulse” or “drop-
on demand”. Four implementations are shown in Fig. 89.29. Often arrays of these devices are integrated into
a  serial  printhead  which  allows  the  printing  of  a  one-character-high-per-head  pass  across  the  paper.  Color
printing can be accomplished by assigning one or more nozzles per color.
