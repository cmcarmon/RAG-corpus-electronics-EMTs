In  addition  to  calculating  defect  removal  efﬁciency,  it  is  also  useful  to  trace  each  incoming  user-reported
defect back to its origin, i.e., whether the defect originated in requirements, design, code, documentation, or
as a result of a “bad ﬁx.” Defect origin analysis also requires a sophisticated tracking system, and full conﬁgu-
ration control and traceability tools are useful adjuncts.
