Now De Forest was getting somewhere. Using his new tube (which he called a triode because it had
3 elements in it), he was able to control relatively large changes of current with very small voltages. But!
was it amplification? Remember, amplification is the process of taking a small signal and increasing its
amplitude. In De Forestâ€™s circuit, the small input signal was 3 volts dc. What De Forest got for an output
