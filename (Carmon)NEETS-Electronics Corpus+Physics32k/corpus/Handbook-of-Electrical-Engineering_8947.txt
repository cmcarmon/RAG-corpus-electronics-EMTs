Finally, there are the true optical mice that use a special surface that is printed with a set of geometric shapes,
usually a grid of lines or dots, that are illuminated and focused on a light detector. The most common form
uses a grid made up of orthogonal lines, with the vertical and horizontal lines printed in different colors. These
colors  absorb  light  at  different  frequencies  so  that  the  optical  detectors  can  differentiate  between  horizontal
