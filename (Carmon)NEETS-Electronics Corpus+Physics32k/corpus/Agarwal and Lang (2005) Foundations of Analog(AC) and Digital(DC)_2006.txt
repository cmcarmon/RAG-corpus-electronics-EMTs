Now let us find the particular solution for this system using the impedance
approach. One possible particular solution is the steady-state response of the
system vp(t) to the cosine signal Io cos
. The impedance model derived
from the original circuit, Figure 14.1, is shown in Figure 14.2. The complex
constants Io and Vp in Figure 14.2 are related to the original time variables by
the expressions:
