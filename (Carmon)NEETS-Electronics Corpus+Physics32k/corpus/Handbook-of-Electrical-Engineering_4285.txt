FM/CW Radar
The most common technique for determining target range is the use of frequency modulation. Typical mod-
ulation  waveforms  include  sinusoidal,  linear  sawtooth,  or  triangular,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 41.9.  For  a  linear
sawtooth, a frequency increasing with time may be transmitted. Upon being reﬂected from a stationary point
target,  the  same  linear  frequency  change  is  reﬂected  back  to  the  receiver,  except  it  has  a  time  delay  which  is
related to the range to the target. The time is T = (2R)/c, where R is the range. The received signal is mixed
with the transmit signal, and the difference or beat frequency (Fb) is obtained. (The sum frequency is much
higher and is rejected by ﬁltering.) For a stationary target this is given by
