Set up the circuit using Figure 7‐11 as your guide. Make sure that you place 
one end of the jumper wire into your breadboard so that it’s electrically con-
nected to the positive side of the capacitor. Then you can use the other end 
to connect the capacitor to R1 (to complete the charging circuit) or to R2 (to 
complete the discharging circuit). You can also leave the other end of the 
jumper wire unconnected (as it is in Figure 7‐11), which I suggest you do later 
in this section. You’ll see why soon.
