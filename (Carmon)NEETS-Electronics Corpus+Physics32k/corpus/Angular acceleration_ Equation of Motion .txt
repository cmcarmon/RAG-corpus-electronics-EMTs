The angular acceleration of a point particle α can be connected to the applied torque τ by the following equation:

{\displaystyle {I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}}={\boldsymbol {\tau }}-2mr{\frac {d{r}}{dt}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
,
where m is the mass of the particle and I is its moment of inertia.
Above relationship indicates that, unlike the relationship between force and acceleration, the angular acceleration need not be directly proportional or even parallel to the torque. In fact, this is true whenever the moment of inertia of the particle changes with time.
