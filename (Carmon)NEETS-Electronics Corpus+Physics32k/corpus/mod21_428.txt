Many types of bridges can be used. For example, an ac bridge that is independent of the applied
frequency can be used. The bridge will become unbalanced when the line is no longer properly
terminated. Improper termination will produce a reactive component as well as a resistive component in
the input impedance of the line and result in a standing wave. The reading of the indicating device
depends on the degree of imbalance, which becomes more severe as the mismatch caused by the
termination becomes worse. The indicating device can be calibrated directly to indicate the standing-wave
ratio. The most common indicator consists of a crystal rectifier, a filtering circuit, and a sensitive dc meter
movement in series with a high resistance.
