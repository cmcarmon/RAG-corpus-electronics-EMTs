These points are best illustrated with an example which is familiar to most readers - the humble motor car.
The first stage of studying the stability of a road vehicle is the derivation of a reasonable approximation to the equations of motion.

The diagram illustrates a four-wheel vehicle, in which the front axle is located a metres ahead of the centre of gravity and the rear axle is b metres aft of the cg. The body of the car is pointing in a direction



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
(theta) whilst it is travelling in a direction



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
(psi). In general, these are not the same. The tyre treads at the region of contact point in the direction of travel, but the hubs are aligned with the vehicle body, with the steering held central. The tyres distort as they rotate to accommodate this mis-alignment, and generate side forces as a consequence.
The net side force Y on the vehicle is the centripetal force causing the vehicle to change the direction it is traveling:

(

{\displaystyle MV{\frac {d\psi }{dt}}=Y\,\cos(\theta -\psi )}

where M is the vehicle mass and V the speed. The angles are all assumed small, so the lateral force equation is:




M
V



d
ψ

=
Y


{\displaystyle MV{\frac {d\psi }{dt}}=Y}

The rotation of the body subjected to a yawing moment N is governed by:

N


{\displaystyle I{\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}=N}

where I is the moment of inertia in yaw. The forces and moments of interest arise from the distortion of the tyres. The angle between the direction the tread is rolling and the hub is called the slip angle. This is a bit of a misnomer, because the tyre as a whole does not actually slip, part of the region in contact with the road adheres, and part of the region slips. We assume that the tyre force is directly proportional to the slip angle (phi). This is made up of the slip of the vehicle as a whole modified by the angular velocity of the body.

This is called a second order linear homogeneous equation, and its properties form the basis of much of control theory.
