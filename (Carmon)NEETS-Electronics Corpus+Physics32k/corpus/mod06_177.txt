The term quiescent identifies the condition of a circuit with NO INPUT SIGNAL applied. With a
given tube, bias supply, and plate supply, an exact amount of plate current will flow with no signal on the
grid. This amount is known as the quiescent value of plate current. The quiescent value of plate voltage is
the voltage between cathode and plate when quiescent current flows.
