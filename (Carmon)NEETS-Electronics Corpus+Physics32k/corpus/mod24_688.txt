For low-frequency applications, analog fiber optic transmitters generally use LEDs operating in
either the 850-nm or 1300-nm window. Typical low frequency applications are analog audio and single
channel video systems. For these systems, sources tend to operate in the 850-nm window. For moderate
frequency applications, sources tend to operate in the 1300-nm window. These types of systems include
multi-channel analog audio and video systems as well as frequency modulated (FM) systems. Laser
sources are almost never used in low- or moderate-frequency analog applications. The main reason for
this is the added circuit complexity that laser sources require. Laser sources are only used if extremely
high transmitter output powers are required in the application. Most low-frequency analog transmitters are
hybrid microcircuit modules, circuit cards, or stand-alone boxes.
