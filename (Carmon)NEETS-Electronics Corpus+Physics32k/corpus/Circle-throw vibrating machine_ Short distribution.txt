On average, 1.5 seconds is required for the screen process to reach a steady state and for particles to cover the screen. This is induced by the circular motion. The rotary acceleration has a loosening effect on the particles on the deck. Centrifugal forces spread particles across the screen. With the combination of the gravitational component, the efficiency of small particle passing through aperture is improved, and large size particles are carried forward towards the discharge end.
