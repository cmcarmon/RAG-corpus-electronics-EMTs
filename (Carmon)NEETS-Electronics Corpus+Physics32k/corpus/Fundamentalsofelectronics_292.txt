Problem 3.7: Detective Work
In the circuit depicted in Figure 3.56, the circuit N1 has the v-i relation v1 = 3i1 + 7 when is = 2.
(a) Find the Thévenin equivalent circuit for circuit N2.
(b) With is = 2, determine R such that i1 = −1.
Problem 3.8: Bridge Circuits
Circuits having the form of one shown in Figure 3.57 are termed bridge circuits.
