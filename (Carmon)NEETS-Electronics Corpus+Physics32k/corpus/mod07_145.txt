Since metallic rectifiers are affected by temperature, atmospheric conditions, and aging (in the case
of copper oxide and selenium), they are being replaced by the improved silicon crystal rectifier. The
silicon rectifier replaces the bulky selenium rectifier as to current and voltage rating, and can operate at
higher ambient (surrounding) temperatures.
