Figure 4.11: The upper plot shows the magnitude of the Fourier series spectrum for the case of T = 1
with the Fourier transform of p (t) shown as a dashed line. For the bottom panel, we expanded the period
to T = 5, keeping the pulse’s duration ﬁxed at 0.2, and computed its Fourier series coeﬃcients.
