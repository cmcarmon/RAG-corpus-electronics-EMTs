Stellar evolution – process by which a star undergoes a sequence of radical changes during its lifetime.
Gravitational collapse – inward fall of a body due to the influence of its own gravity.
Neutron star – type of stellar remnant that can result from the gravitational collapse of a massive star during a Type II, Type Ib or Type Ic supernova event.
Compact star – white dwarfs, neutron stars, other exotic dense stars, and black holes.
Quark star – hypothetical type of exotic star composed of quark matter, or strange matter.
Exotic star – compact star composed of something other than electrons, protons, and neutrons balanced against gravitational collapse by degeneracy pressure or other quantum properties.

Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff – upper bound to the mass of stars composed of neutron-degenerate matter .
White dwarf – also called a degenerate dwarf, is a small star composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter.
Supernova – stellar explosion that is more energetic than a nova.
Hypernova – also known as a Type Ic Supernova, refers to an immensely large star that collapses at the end of its lifespan.
Gamma-ray burst – flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies.
