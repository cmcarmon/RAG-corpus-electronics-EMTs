The TCP/IP network architecture also refers to the Internet
architecture. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a
transport layer protocol, and the Internet Protocol (IP) is
a network layer protocol. Both protocols were evolved from
a earlier packet switching network called ARPANET that was
funded by the Department of Defense. The TCP/IP network
has been the center of many networking technologies and
applications. Many network protocols and applications are
running at the top of the TCP/IP protocol. For example,
the Voice over IP (VOIP) and the Video Conference applica-
tion using MBONE are the applications running over the
TCP/IP network. The TCP/IP network has the corresponding
Ô¨Åve layers in the OSI reference model. Figure 6.2 shows the
