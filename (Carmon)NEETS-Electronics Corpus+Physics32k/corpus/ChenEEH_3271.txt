voltages and currents in the system are most easily seen relative
to their rated values. Thus, most system analysis is done on a
normalization called the per unit system. In the per unit
system, a system power base is established, and the rated
voltages at each point in the network are determined. All
system variables are then given relative to this value. These
base quantities for the currents can be found as:
