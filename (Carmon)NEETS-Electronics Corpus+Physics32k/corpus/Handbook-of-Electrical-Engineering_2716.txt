The initial partition has cost 5 since nets a, b, h, g, f connect the cells in the two sets. Then the algorithm
selects cell 1, which has the maximum gain. The new partition has cost 3 (nets e, g, f), and cell 1 is no longer
free. The Ô¨Ånal partition has no free cells. The best partition in this pass has cost 3.
