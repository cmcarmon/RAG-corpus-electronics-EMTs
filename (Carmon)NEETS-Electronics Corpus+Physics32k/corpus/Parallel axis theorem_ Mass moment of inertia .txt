Suppose a body of mass m is made to rotate about an axis z passing through the body's centre of gravity. The body has a moment of inertia Icm with respect to this axis. The parallel axis theorem states that if the body is made to rotate instead about a new axis z′ which is parallel to the first axis and displaced from it by a distance d, then the moment of inertia I with respect to the new axis is related to Icm by

{\displaystyle I=I_{\mathrm {cm} }+md^{2}.}

Explicitly, d is the perpendicular distance between the axes z and z′.
The parallel axis theorem can be applied with the stretch rule and perpendicular axis theorem to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes.
