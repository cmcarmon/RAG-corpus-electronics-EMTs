turns out to have a peak at approximately v ¼ 1, and the peak
grows with the order n.
The poles of the normalized Butterworth (or maximally
ﬂat) ﬁlter lie on a circle with a radius r ¼ 1. Figure 4.17 shows
the situation for n ¼ 3 and n ¼ 4. Extension to higher degrees is
easy to extrapolate from these two ﬁgures: all odd powers will
have one real pole, and all even powers will have only complex
conjugate poles. The poles of a few ﬁlters are in Table 4.1.
