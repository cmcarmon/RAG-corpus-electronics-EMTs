Component removal and replacement 
 
Care  must  be  exercised  when  removing  and 
replacing printed circuit mounted components (see 
Figs  19.23  to  19.28).  It  is  first  necessary  to 
accurately locate the component to be removed on 
the upper (component) side of the PCB and then to 
correctly  identify  its  solder  pads  on  the  underside 
of  the  PCB.  Once  located,  the  component  pads 
should be gently heated using a soldering iron. The 
soldering iron bit should be regularly cleaned using 
a damp sponge (a small tin containing such an item 
is  a  useful  adjunct  to  any  soldering  work  station). 
The  power  rating  of  the  iron  should  be  the 
minimum  consistent  with  effective  removal  of  the 
components  and  should  therefore  not  normally 
exceed  20  W  for  types  which  do  not  have 
temperature  control  since  excessive  heat  can  not 
only damage components but may also destroy the 
bond between the copper track and the board itself. 
This  latter  effect  causes  lifting  of  pads  and  tracks 
from the surface of the PCB and should be avoided 
at all costs.
