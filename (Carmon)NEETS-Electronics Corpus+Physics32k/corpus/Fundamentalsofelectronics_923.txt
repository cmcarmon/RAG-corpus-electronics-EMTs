practice to keep error rates low, but they remain greater than zero. Until the “magic” code is found, more
important in communication system design is the converse. It states that if your data rate exceeds capacity,
errors will overwhelm you no matter what channel coding you use. For this reason, capacity calculations are
made to understand the fundamental limits on transmission rates.
