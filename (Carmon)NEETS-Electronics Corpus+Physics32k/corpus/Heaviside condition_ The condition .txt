A transmission line can be represented as a distributed element model of its primary line constants as shown in the figure. The primary constants are the electrical properties of the cable per unit length and are: capacitance C (in farads per meter), inductance L (in henries per meter), series resistance R (in ohms per meter), and shunt conductance G (in siemens per meter). The series resistance and shunt conductivity cause losses in the line; for an ideal transmission line,




R
=
G
=
0



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle R=G=0}
.
The Heaviside condition is satisfied when






G
C


=


R
L


.


{\displaystyle {\frac {G}{C}}={\frac {R}{L}}.}

This condition is for no distortion, but not for no loss.
