Consider the problem of a scalar wave produced by a source
f (r) in the presence of an arbitrarily shaped object immersed
in an inﬁnite medium, as illustrated in Figure 8.1. Assume that
both the source and the object have no variation along the z-
axis; thus, we only have to consider a plane perpendicular to
the z-axis. Exterior to the object, the wave function f(r)
satisﬁes the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation:
