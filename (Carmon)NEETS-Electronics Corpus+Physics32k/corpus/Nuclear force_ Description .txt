While the nuclear force is usually associated with nucleons, more generally this force is felt between hadrons, or particles composed of quarks. At small separations between nucleons (less than ~ 0.7 fm between their centers, depending upon spin alignment) the force becomes repulsive, which keeps the nucleons at a certain average separation, even if they are of different types. This repulsion arises from the Pauli exclusion force for identical nucleons (such as two neutrons or two protons). A Pauli exclusion force also occurs between quarks of the same type within nucleons, when the nucleons are different (a proton and a neutron, for example).
