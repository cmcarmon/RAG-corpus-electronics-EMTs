an AC power supply (50 or 60 Hz), setting up a magnetic field that then 
induces a current in a rotor placed in the center of the magnetic field. 
That current then creates another magnetic field that opposes the origi-
nal magnetic field, causing the rotor to spin. Induction motors are com-
monly used in fans and household appliances.
