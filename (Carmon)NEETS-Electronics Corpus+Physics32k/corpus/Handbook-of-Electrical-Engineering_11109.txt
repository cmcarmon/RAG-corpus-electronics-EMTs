Assuming bone tissue with conductivity 10–2 S/m, a physiological temperature of 37(cid:176)C, an interaction volume
of 10–14 m3 (about equal to the volume of a cell with 10-mm radius), and an observation time of 200 ms equal
to the duration of the positive pulse of device A, one obtains from Eq. (113.19) a minimum value of 6.6 V/m.
Unless  v  and s  can  be  assumed  to  be  much  larger,  this  would  indicate  that  the  values  given  in  Table  113.3
should be below thermal noise. If one considers, instead of charge transfer over some as yet unknown path,
the voltage induced by the applied ﬁeld across the membrane of the idealized spherical cell with 10-mm radius,
and  compares  the  energy  of  the  repetitive  pulse  below  100  Hz—where  biological  action  apparently  occurs
[McLead and Rubin, 1990]—with the thermal noise voltage given by
