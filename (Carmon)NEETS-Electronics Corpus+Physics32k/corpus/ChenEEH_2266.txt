In this case, the k vector is proportional to the real vector ^RR,
so the result of equation 3.27 applies. The unit vector ^RR then
gives the direction of time-average power ï¬‚ow and also points
in the direction of the phase and attenuation vectors. That is,
all three vectors point in the same direction for a homoge-
neous plane wave. This direction is, unambiguously, the direc-
tion of propagation of the plane wave. The planes of constant
phase are also then the planes of constant amplitude, being
the planes perpendicular to the ^RR vector. That is, the plane
wave has a uniform amplitude across the plane perpendicular
