The MAC sublayer speciÔ¨Åes the media access protocol that stations use to share the media. In fully broadcast
media no more than one station may transmit at a time, so the MAC sublayer manages exclusive access to the
broadcast media. The ring topology is well suited to a token-passing MAC protocol, which gives transmission
rights to the station holding the token. The token is represented by a special packet that is passed sequentially
from station to station. When a station recognizes the token, it seizes it and begins transmitting buffered packets,
or passes the token to the next station if it has no packet to transmit. To limit the time that a station can hold
the token, the MAC protocol can implement one of several disciplines:
