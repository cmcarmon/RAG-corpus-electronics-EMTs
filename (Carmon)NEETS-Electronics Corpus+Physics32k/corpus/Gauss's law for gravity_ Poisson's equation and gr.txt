Since the gravitational field has zero curl (equivalently, gravity is a conservative force) as mentioned above, it can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential, called the gravitational potential:





g

=
−
∇
ϕ
.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\nabla \phi .}

Then the differential form of Gauss's law for gravity becomes Poisson's equation:





∇

2


ϕ
=
4
π
G
ρ
.


{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =4\pi G\rho .}

This provides an alternate means of calculating the gravitational potential and gravitational field. Although computing g via Poisson's equation is mathematically equivalent to computing g directly from Gauss's law, one or the other approach may be an easier computation in a given situation.
In radially symmetric systems, the gravitational potential is a function of only one variable (namely,



r
=

|


r


|



{\displaystyle r=|\mathbf {r} |}
), and Poisson's equation becomes (see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates):

=

)


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(r^{2}\,{\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial r}}\right)=4\pi G\rho (r)}

while the gravitational field is:





g

=
−

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-\mathbf {e_{r}} {\frac {\partial \phi }{\partial r}}.}

When solving the equation it should be taken into account that in the case of finite densities ∂ϕ/∂r has to be continuous at boundaries (discontinuities of the density), and zero for r = 0.
