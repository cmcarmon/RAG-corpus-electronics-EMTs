L–C circuits 
 
Two  forms  of  L–C  circuits  are  illustrated  in  Fig. 
4.13.  Figure  4.13(a)  is  a  series  resonant  circuit 
while  Fig.  4.13(b)  constitutes  a  parallel  resonant 
circuit. The impedance of both circuits varies in  a 
complex manner with frequency.  
  The impedance of the series circuit in Fig. 4.13
(a) is given by:
