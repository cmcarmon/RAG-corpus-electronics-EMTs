Adaptive-control  systems  are  time-varying  systems.  Therefore,  it  is  usually  difﬁcult  to  prove  that  they  are
stable. Szidarovszky et al. [1990], however, show a technique for doing this. This new result gives a necessary
and sufﬁcient condition for the existence of an asymptotically stable model-following adaptive-control system
based on the solvability of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, and in the case of the existence of such
systems they present an algorithm for ﬁnding the appropriate feedback parameters.
