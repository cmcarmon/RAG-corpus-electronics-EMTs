The schematic circuit symbols for bipolar transistors are shown in Ô¨Ågure 5.1. The arrows
on the schematic symbols indicate the direction of both IB and IC. The collector is usually
at a higher voltage than the emitter. The emitter-base junction is forward biased while the
collector-base junction is reversed biased.
