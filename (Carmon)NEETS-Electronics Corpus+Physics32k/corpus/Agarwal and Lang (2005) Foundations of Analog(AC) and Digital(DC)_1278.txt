Because the SRC model contains a capacitor between the gate and source
terminals of the MOSFET, a current will flow into the gate terminal and out
from the source terminal of that model as the gate-to-source voltage of the
MOSFET varies. This current transports the charge that accumulates within
the MOSFET as seen in Figures 9.22 and 9.23. Following Equation 9.9, the
current is given by
