In  general,  IGBTs  can  be  classiﬁed  as  punch-
through  (PT)  and  nonpunch-through  (NPT)  struc-
tures,  as  shown  in  Fig.  30.6.  In  the  PT  IGBT,  an  N
+
buffer  layer  is  normally  introduced  between  the  P
+
substrate and the N
 epitaxial layer, so that the whole
–
 drift region is depleted when the device is blocking
N
–
the  off-state  voltage,  and  the  electrical  ﬁeld  shape
  drift  region  is  close  to  a  rectangular
inside  the  N
–
 region can be used in the
shape. Because a shorter N
punch-through IGBT, a better trade-off between the
forward  voltage  drop  and  turn-off  time  can  be
achieved. PT IGBTs are available up to about 1200 V.
High  voltage  IGBTs  are  realized  through  non-
punch-through process. The devices are built on a N
–
wafer  substrate  which  serves  as  the  N
  base  drift
–
region. Experimental NPT IGBTs of up to about 4 KV
have been reported in the literature. NPT IGBTs are
more robust than PT IGBTs particularly under short
circuit conditions. But NPT IGBTs have a higher for-
ward voltage drop than the PT IGBTs.
