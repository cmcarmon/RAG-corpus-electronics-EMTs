When the plant is nonlinear, its frequency response also depends on the input sinusoidal amplitude repre-
sented as G ( jw, a). In recent years several approaches [Nanka-Bruce and Atherton, 1990; Taylor and Strobel,
1984] use the DF method to design a nonlinear compensator for the plant, with the objective of closed-loop
performance independent of the input amplitude.
