One type of copper loss is I2R LOSS. In rf lines the resistance of the conductors is never equal to
zero. Whenever current flows through one of these conductors, some energy is dissipated in the form of
heat. This heat loss is a POWER LOSS. With copper braid, which has a resistance higher than solid
tubing, this power loss is higher.
