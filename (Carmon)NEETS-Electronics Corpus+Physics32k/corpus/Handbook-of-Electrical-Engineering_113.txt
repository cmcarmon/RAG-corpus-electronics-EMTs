where K = coupling coefﬁcient; M = mutual inductance, H; and L1 and L2 = inductances of the two coils, H.
An inductor in a circuit has a reactance equal to  j2pf L W. Mutual inductance in a circuit has a reactance
equal  to  j2pf L  W.  The  operator  j  denotes  that  the  reactance  dissipates  no  energy;  however,  it  does  oppose
current ﬂow.
