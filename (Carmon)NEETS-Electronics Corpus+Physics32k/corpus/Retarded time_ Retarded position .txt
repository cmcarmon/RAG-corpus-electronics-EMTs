The retarded position can be obtained from the current position of a particle by subtracting the distance that has travelled in the lapse from the retarded time to the current time. For an inertial particle, this position can be obtained by solving this equation:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} =\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r_{c}} +{\frac {|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r'} |}{c}}\mathbf {v} }

Where rc is the current position of the source charge distribution and v its velocity.
