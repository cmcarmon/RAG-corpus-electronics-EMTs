master-slave ﬂip-ﬂop types. Due to the better design features and popularity of edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops, master-
slave  ﬂip-ﬂops  are  not  recommended  for  newer  designs  and  in  some  cases  have  been  made  obsolete  by
manufacturers, making them difﬁcult to obtain even for repair parts. For this reason only edge-triggered ﬂip-
ﬂops will be discussed.
