A parametric amplifier that is not phase-sensitive, referred to as a NONDEGENERATIVE 
PARAMETRIC AMPLIFIER, uses a pump circuit with a frequency higher than twice the input signal. 
The higher-frequency pump signal mixes with the input signal and produces additional frequencies that 
represent both the sum and difference of the input signal and pump frequencies.
