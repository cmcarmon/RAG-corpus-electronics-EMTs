The parameter is derived from one of the so-called Delaunay standard variables, used to study the perturbed Hamiltonian in a three-body system. Ignoring higher-order perturbation terms, the following value is conserved:

Consequently, perturbations may lead to the resonance between the orbital inclination and eccentricity, known as Kozai resonance. Near-circular, highly inclined orbits can thus become very eccentric in exchange for lower inclination. For example, such a mechanism can produce sungrazing comets, because a large eccentricity with a constant semimajor axis results in a small perihelion.
