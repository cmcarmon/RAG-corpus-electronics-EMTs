Now again numbers: ROM — average 56kb, RAM — 2kb, EEPROM — up to 64kb. The ﬁrst impression we
might  have  is  that  such  a  machine  should  give  the  output  several  tens  of  times  better  than  its  8-bit  sister.
Surprise! The recent benchmarking based on Java Card applications (Java Card will be discussed later) have
shown that the performances of both cards may be comparable, but not the price, as the 32-bit card is several
times more expensive. So why go in this direction?
