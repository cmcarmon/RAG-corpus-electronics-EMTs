The above inner product can also be written in terms of β and its time derivative. Then the relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula is (in CGS units)

This is the Liénard result, which was first obtained in 1898. The

β

{\displaystyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}
is very close to one (i.e.



β
≪
1


{\displaystyle \beta \ll 1}
) the radiation emitted by the particle is likely to be negligible. However, as



β
→
1


{\displaystyle \beta \rightarrow 1}
the radiation grows like




γ

{\displaystyle \gamma ^{6}}
as the particle tries to lose its energy in the form of EM waves. Also, when the acceleration and velocity are orthogonal the power is reduced by a factor of

{\displaystyle 1-\beta ^{2}=1/\gamma ^{2}}
, i.e. the factor

{\displaystyle \gamma ^{6}}
becomes

{\displaystyle \gamma ^{4}}
. The faster the motion becomes the greater this reduction gets.
We can use Liénard's result to predict what sort of radiation losses to expect in different kinds of motion.
