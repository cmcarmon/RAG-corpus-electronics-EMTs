Frequency and Time-Domain Response
Small-Signal CS Model for High-Frequency Response
We will now consider the frequency- and time-domain response of the JFET CS ampliﬁer. In Fig. 24.18 an ac
representation of a CS ampliﬁer is shown, the dc biasing not being shown. In Fig. 24.19 the JFET small-signal
ac  equivalent  circuit  model  is  shown  including  the  junction  capacitances  CGS  and  CGD.  The  gate-to-drain
capacitance CGD is a feedback capacitance in that it is connected between output (drain) and input (gate). Using
