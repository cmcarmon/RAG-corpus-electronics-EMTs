An insulator is actually a system of components consisting of
the dielectric, terminal electrodes or end-ﬁttings, and internal
parts that help attach the dielectric to the electrodes. There are
many details involved in these components and constructional
methods. However, insulators are recognized largely by the
classiﬁcation of the dielectric employed. There are three main
classes of dielectrics that have been used for outdoor HV
insulator construction: porcelain, glass, and polymer. Hence,
the nomenclature of porcelain, glass and polymeric insulators
is well-known. Polymeric insulators are also commonly known
by other names, such as composite (in Europe) and non-
ceramic (in North America).
