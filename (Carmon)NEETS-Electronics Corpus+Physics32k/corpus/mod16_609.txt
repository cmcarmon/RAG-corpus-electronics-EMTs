Assume, for example, that a peak-to-peak value of a known voltage applied to the oscilloscope
indicates that each inch marking on the graticule is equal to 60 volts. Each of the 10 subdivisions will,
therefore, equal a value of 6 volts. Most oscilloscopes have ATTENUATOR controls to decrease or
GAIN controls to increase the strength of a signal before it is placed on the deflection plates. Attenuator
and gain settings must not be disturbed after the calibration has been made. For maximum accuracy, you
should recalibrate the graticule each time a voltage is to be measured.
