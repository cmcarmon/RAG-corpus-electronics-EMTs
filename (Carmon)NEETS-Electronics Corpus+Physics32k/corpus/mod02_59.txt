 The study of inductance presents a very challenging but rewarding segment of electricity. It is 
challenging in the sense that, at first, it will seem that new concepts are being introduced. You will realize 
as this chapter progresses that these "new concepts" are merely extensions and enlargements of 
fundamental principles that you learned previously in the study of magnetism and electron physics. The 
study of inductance is rewarding in the sense that a thorough understanding of it will enable you to 
acquire a working knowledge of electrical circuits more rapidly.
