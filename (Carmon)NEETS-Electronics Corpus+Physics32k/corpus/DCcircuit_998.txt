One more example of a previous circuit follows. The resistance around loop 1 is 6 Ω, around
loop 2: 3 Ω. The resistance common to both loops is 2 Ω. Note the coefﬁcients of I1 and I2 in
the pair of equations. Tracing the assumed counterclockwise loop 1 current through B1 from
(+) to (-) corresponds to an electron current ﬂow voltage rise. Thus, the sign of the 28 V is
positive. The loop 2 counter clockwise assumed current traces (-) to (+) through B2, a voltage
drop. Thus, the sign of B2 is negative, -7 in the 2nd mesh equation. Once again, there are no
polarity markings on the resistors. Nor do they ﬁgure into the equations.
