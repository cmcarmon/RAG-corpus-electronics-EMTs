A Personal Car Communicator (PCC) is a system of protection in a key fob developed by Volvo.
The Personal Car Communicator was first introduced by the company in the new S80 sedan for model year 2007. The personal car communicator uses a two-way radio communicator, allowing the vehicle owner to check such security items as the locking status of the vehicle. Most notable is the ability of a heart beat monitor that checks if someone is left inside the car.
