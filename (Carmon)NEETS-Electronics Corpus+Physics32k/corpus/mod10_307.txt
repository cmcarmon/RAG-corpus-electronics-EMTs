Because the amount of absorption of the sky wave depends on the density of the ionosphere, which 
varies with seasonal and daily conditions, it is impossible to express a fixed relationship between distance 
and signal strength for ionospheric propagation. Under certain conditions, the absorption of energy is so 
great that communicating over any distance beyond the line of sight is difficult.
