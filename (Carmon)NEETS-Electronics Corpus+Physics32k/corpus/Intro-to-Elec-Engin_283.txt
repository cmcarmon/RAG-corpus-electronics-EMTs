where −01,−02, . . . ,−0m are the zeros, and −p1,−p2, . . . ,−pn are the poles of the network
function. Equation (3.4.6) is clearly the product of a constant and a group of terms having the form
(1 + j ω/ω0) or 1/(1 + j ω/ω0). Each of these terms can be considered as an individual phasor,
and ¯H (j ω) has a magnitude given by the product of the individual magnitudes (or the sum of the
individual terms expressed in dB) and an angle given by the sum of the individual angles. Thus
the behavior of functions (1 + j ω/ω0) and 1/(1 + j ω/ω0) is to be clearly understood for the
construction of Bode plots.
¯H1(j ω) = 1 + j ω/ω0. For ω/ω0 << 1 (i.e., low frequencies), the
magnitude H1(ω) ∼= 1, or H1(ω)dB = 20 log 1 = 0 dB. The break frequency is ω = ω0. At high
