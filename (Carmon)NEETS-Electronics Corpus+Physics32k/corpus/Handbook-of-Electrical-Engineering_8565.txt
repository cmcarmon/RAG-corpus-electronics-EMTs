Operating System Support
One  of  the  ﬁrst  applications,  besides  emulation,  was  to  support  some  operating  system  functions.  Since
microprograms are closer to the hardware and programming directly in microcode removes the overhead of
decoding machine-level instructions, it was thought that directly coding operating system (OS) functions would
improve  their  performance.  Success  was  achieved  in  some  areas,  such  as  virtual  memory.  In  general,  people
write most OS functions in assembly language, probably because the cost is not offset by the beneﬁts, especially
with rapidly changing OS versions. The problems raised by the human side of programming have changed the
question “Should  it  be  in  microcode  or  in  assembler?”  to  the  question “Should  it  be  in  assembler  or  in  C?”
This parallels the CISC/RISC debate.
