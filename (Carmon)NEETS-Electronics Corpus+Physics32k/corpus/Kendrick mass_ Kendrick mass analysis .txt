In a Kendrick mass analysis, the Kendrick mass defect is plotted as function of nominal Kendrick mass for ions observed in a mass spectrum. Ions of the same family, for example the members of an alkylation series, have the same Kendrick mass defect but different nominal Kendrick mass and are positioned along a horizontal line on the plot. If the composition of one ion in the family can be determined, the composition of the other ions can be inferred. Horizontal lines of different Kendrick mass defect correspond to ions of different composition, for example degree of saturation or heteroatom content.
A Kendrick mass analysis is often used in conjunction with a Van Krevelen diagram, a two- or three- dimensional graphical analysis in which the elemental composition of the compounds are plotted according to the atomic ratios H/C, O/C, or N/C.
