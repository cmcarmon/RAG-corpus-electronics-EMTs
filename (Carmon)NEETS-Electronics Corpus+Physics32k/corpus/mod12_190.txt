Keeping these factors in mind, you should be able to see that the phase angles between the two 
sideband frequencies, and between each sideband frequency and the carrier frequency, will continually 
shift. At an instant in time (T3), the carrier and sidebands will be in phase [view (E)], causing the 
envelope amplitude [view (F)] to be twice the amplitude of the carrier. At another instant in time (T7), the 
sidebands are out of phase with the carrier [view (E)], causing complete cancellation of the rf voltage. 
The envelope amplitude will become 0 at this point. You should see that, although the carrier and 
sideband frequencies have constant amplitudes, the ever-changing phase differences between them causes 
the modulation envelope to vary continuously in amplitude.
