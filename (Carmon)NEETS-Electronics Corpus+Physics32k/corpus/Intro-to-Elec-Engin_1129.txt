2(1 − S)/S, which corresponds to the load.
(cid:7)
This much power is absorbed by a resistance of R
(cid:7)
2/S has been split into two terms, as in Equation (13.2.4)
For this reason, the resistance term R
and shown in the equivalent circuit of Figure 13.2.6. From Equation (13.2.6) we can see that of
the total power delivered to the rotor, the fraction 1 − S is converted to mechanical power and
the fraction S is dissipated as rotor copper loss. We can then conclude that an induction motor
operating at high slip values will be inefﬁcient.
