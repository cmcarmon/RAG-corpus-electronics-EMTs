BSIM2 Extraction Strategy
We do not cover the BSIM2 strategy in complete detail because it is very similar to the BSIM strategy, except
more parameters are involved. The major difference in the two models is the inclusion of extra terms in BSIM2
for ﬁtting Gds (refer to Fig. 13.15, which shows how badly BSIM typically ﬁts 1/Gds vs. Vds). Basically, the BSIM2
strategy follows the BSIM strategy for the extraction of parameters not related to Gds. Once these have been
obtained, the last part of the strategy includes steps for ﬁtting to Gds with parameters that account for channel
length modulation and hot electron effects. The way this proceeds in BSIM2 is to ﬁt Ids ﬁrst, and then parameters
MU2, MU3, and MU4 are used to ﬁt to 1/Gds vs. Vds curves for families of Vg s and Vbs. This can be a very time
consuming and frustrating experience, because ﬁtting to 1/Gds is quite difﬁcult. Also, the equations describing
how Gds is modeled with MU2, MU3, and MU4 are very unphysical and the interplay between the parameters
makes ﬁtting awkward. The reader is referred to Fig. 13.16, which shows how BSIM2 typically ﬁts 1/Gds vs. Vds.
BSIM2 is certainly better than BSIM but it has its own problems ﬁtting 1/Gds.
BSIM3 Comments
The BSIM3 model is very new and will undoubtedly change in the future [Huang et al., 1993]. We will not list
a BSIM3 strategy here, but focus instead on the features of the model that make it appealing for analog modeling.
BSIM3 has terms for ﬁtting Gds that relate to channel length modulation, drain-induced barrier lowering,
and hot electron effects. They are incorporated completely differently from the Gds ﬁtting parameters of BSIM2.
In  BSIM3  these  parameters  enter  through  a  generalized  Early  voltage  relation,  with  the  drain  current  in
saturation written as
