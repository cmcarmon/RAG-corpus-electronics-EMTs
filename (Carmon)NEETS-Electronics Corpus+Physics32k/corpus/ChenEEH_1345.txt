For many years, cache has been used to speed up memory access
and overcome bottlenecks in a uniprocessor computer systems.
All the reasons for using caches with uniprocessors also exist
with multiprocessor systems but exist more acutely. A typical
shared-bus SMP system will have its performance severely
limited by bus cycle time without using local cache memory.
