▶✓ Place ICs first, straddling the center gap. Allow at least three — and 
preferably ten — columns of holes (that is, terminal strips) between 
each IC. You can use a chip inserter/extractor tool to implant and 
remove ICs to reduce the chances of damaging the IC while handling it.
If you’re working with CMOS chips, be sure that you ground the tool to 
eliminate stray static electricity. (Refer to Chapter 13 for details.)
