An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates



(
σ
,
τ
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau ,z)}
are sometimes used, where



σ
=
cosh
⁡
μ


{\displaystyle \sigma =\cosh \mu }
and



τ
=
cos
⁡
ν


{\displaystyle \tau =\cos \nu }
. Hence, the curves of constant



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
are hyperbolae. The coordinate



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
The coordinates



(
σ
,
τ
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (\sigma ,\tau ,z)}
have a simple relation to the distances to the foci




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}
and




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}
. For any point in the (x,y) plane, the sum




d

1


+

d

2




{\displaystyle d_{1}+d_{2}}
of its distances to the foci equals



2
a
σ


{\displaystyle 2a\sigma }
, whereas their difference




d

1


−

d

2




{\displaystyle d_{1}-d_{2}}
equals



2
a
τ


{\displaystyle 2a\tau }
. Thus, the distance to




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}
is



a
(
σ
+
τ
)


{\displaystyle a(\sigma +\tau )}
, whereas the distance to




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}
is



a
(
σ
−
τ
)


{\displaystyle a(\sigma -\tau )}
. (Recall that




F

1




{\displaystyle F_{1}}
and




F

2




{\displaystyle F_{2}}
are located at



x
=
−
a


{\displaystyle x=-a}
and



x
=
+
a


{\displaystyle x=+a}
, respectively.)
A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the Cartesian coordinates




x
=
a
σ
τ


{\displaystyle x=a\sigma \tau }
