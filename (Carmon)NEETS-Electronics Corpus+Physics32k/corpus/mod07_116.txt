Current flow through the P-type material is illustrated in figure 1-16. Conduction in the P material is
by positive holes, instead of negative electrons. A hole moves from the positive terminal of the P material
to the negative terminal. Electrons from the external circuit enter the negative terminal of the material and
fill holes in the vicinity of this terminal. At the positive terminal, electrons are removed from the covalent
bonds, thus creating new holes. This process continues as the steady stream of holes (hole current) moves
toward the negative terminal.
