Implicit in using the transfer function is that the input is a complex exponential, and the output is also a
complex exponential having the same frequency. The transfer function reveals how the circuit modiﬁes the
input amplitude in creating the output amplitude. Thus, the transfer function completely describes how
the circuit processes the input complex exponential to produce the output complex exponential. The circuit’s
function is thus summarized by the transfer function. In fact, circuits are often designed to meet transfer
function speciﬁcations. Because transfer functions are complex-valued, frequency-dependent quantities, we
can better appreciate a circuit’s function by examining the magnitude and phase of its transfer function
(Figure 3.28).
