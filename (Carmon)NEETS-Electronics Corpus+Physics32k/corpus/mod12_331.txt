Thus far, we have established a carrier and have caused its peaks to increase and decrease as a
modulating square wave is applied. Some pulse-modulation systems modulate a carrier in this manner.
Others produce no rf until pulsed; that is, rf occurs only during the actual pulse as shown in view (A) of
figure 2-30. For example, letâ€™s start with an rf carrier frequency of 1 megahertz. Each cycle of the rf
requires a certain amount of time to complete. If we allow oscillations to occur for a given period of time
only during selected intervals, as in view (B), we are PULSING the system. Note that the pulse
transmitter does not produce an rf signal until one of the positive-going modulating pulses is applied. The
transmitter then produces the rf carrier until the positive input pulse ends and the input waveform again
becomes a negative potential.
