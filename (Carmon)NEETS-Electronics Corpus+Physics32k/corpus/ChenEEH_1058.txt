Transistor Sizing
While building a library, it is quite useful to design the com-
ponents with different sizes for a wide range of gate loads; each
component is thus sized to optimally drive a certain load.
Transistor sizing at the circuit level complements design tech-
niques at the gate level, where logic level sizing can help the
synthesis tool in selecting the component with optimum sizing
for low-power consumption. Another sizing example is to
effectively drive a large load from a source with low driving
capability. One could insert a large buffer between the driving
circuit and the load to effectively drive the load, but this
solution will not solve the problem; it will only change the
problem to effectively drive the large buffer. A traditional
solution for this problem is to use a chain of successively larger
buffers, each driving an appropriate load, as shown in Figure
5.19. Too many buffers result in more stages with large propa-
gation delay and more capacitive nodes with more power
consumption. On the other hand, two few buffers will lead
to output slopes that are not steep, resulting in larger delays
and more short circuit power consumption. One traditional
solution to effectively drive the large load can be found in work
by Mead and Conway (1980) as well as by Cong and Koh
(1994).
