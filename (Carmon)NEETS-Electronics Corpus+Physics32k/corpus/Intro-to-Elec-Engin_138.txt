*1.2.3 A copper conductor has 12 strands with each
strand diameter of 0.1328 in. For this conductor,
ﬁnd the total copper cross-sectional area in cmil
(see Problem 1.2.1 for deﬁnition of cmil), and
calculate the dc resistance at 20°C in (ohms/km),
assuming a 2% increase in resistance due to spi-
raling.
