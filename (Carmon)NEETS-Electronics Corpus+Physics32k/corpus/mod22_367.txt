Using an 8-bit code, it is possible to represent 256 different characters or bit combinations. This 
provides a unique code for each decimal value 0 through 9 (for a total of 10), each uppercase and 
lowercase letter (for a total of 52), and for a variety of special characters. In addition to four numeric bits, 
four zone bit positions are used in 8-bit code as illustrated in figure 4-3. Each group of the eight bits 
makes up one alphabetic, numeric, or special character and is called a byte.
