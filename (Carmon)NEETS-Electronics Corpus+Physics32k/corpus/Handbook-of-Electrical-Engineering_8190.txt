The potential market for large plasma displays is enormous. The most optimistic market projections show
annual world-wide sales of about 10 million plasma displays in the year 2002. While this projection shows a
very rapid growth, it is still only 5% of the slightly less than 200 million television sets that will be sold that
year. More conservative projections still show $5 billion world-wide sales for plasma displays in 2002.
