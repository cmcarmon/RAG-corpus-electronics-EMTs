The input ampliﬁer ampliﬁes the natural heart signals, which have a small amplitude on the
order of 1 mV. Filtering eliminates certain frequency components so that heartbeats can be better
detected. A comparative circuit is then used to compare the ampliﬁed and ﬁltered signal with
a threshold value and detect either a natural heartbeat or an output pacing pulse. This detection
decision is passed on to the counting and timing circuitry through an AND gate. The second input
to the AND gate comes from the counter circuit, such that input signals for 0.4 s after the start of
a natural or forced beat are ignored.
