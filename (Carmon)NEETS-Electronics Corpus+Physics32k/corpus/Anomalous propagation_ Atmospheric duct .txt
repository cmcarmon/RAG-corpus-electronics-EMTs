When the inversion is very strong and shallow, the EM wave is trapped within the inversion layer. The beam will bounce many times inside the layer as within a waveguide. In surface-based ducting, the beam will hit the ground many times, causing return echoes at regular distances toward the emitter. In elevated ducts, the transmission can be extended to very large distances.
