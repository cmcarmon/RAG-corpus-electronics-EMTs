The cepstrum is particularly well-suited to working with a
warped frequency axis since it is based directly on the magni-
tude spectrum of the speech. Suppose one desires to compute
the cepstral parameters at frequencies distributed linearly on
the range 0–1 kHz and logarithmically above 1 kHz. One ap-
proach is to ‘‘oversample’’ the frequency axis with the DFT–
IDFT pair by using, say, a N0 ¼ 1024 or 2048 point DFT, then
selecting those frequency components in the DFT that repre-
sent the appropriate distribution. The remaining components
can be set to zero, or, more commonly, a second psychoacous-
tic principle is invoked.
Loosely speaking, it has been found that the perception of a
particular frequency by the auditory system, say F0, is inﬂu-
enced by energy in a critical band of frequencies around F0
(O’Shaughnessy, 1987). Further, the bandwidth of these crit-
ical bands varies with frequency, beginning at about 100 Hz for
frequencies below 1 kHz, then increasing logarithmically above
1 kHz. Therefore, rather than simply using the mel-distributed
log magnitude frequency components to compute the cep-
strum, it has become common to use the log total energy in
critical bands around the mel frequencies as inputs to the ﬁnal
DFT. The energy components in each critical band are
weighted by a critical band ﬁlter to account for their relative
inﬂuences in the band (Davis and Mermelstein, 1980; Dautrich
