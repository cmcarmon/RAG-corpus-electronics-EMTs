Figure 4.10 shows the output changes as we vary the ﬁlter’s cutoﬀ frequency. Note how the signal’s
spectrum extends well above its fundamental frequency. Having a cutoﬀ frequency ten times higher
than the fundamental does perceptibly change the output waveform, rounding the leading and
trailing edges. As the cutoﬀ frequency decreases (center, then left), the rounding becomes more
prominent, with the leftmost waveform showing a small ripple.
Exercise 4.11
What is the average value of each output waveform? The correct answer may surprise you.
