In vacuum, heat escapes as radiation isotropically. If the source remains stationary in a compressible fluid such as air, flow patterns can form around the source due to convection, leading to an anisotropic pattern of heat loss. The most common form of anisotropy is the formation of a thermal plume above the heat source. Examples:
Geological hotspots on the surface of the Earth which lie at the tops of thermal plumes rising from deep inside the Earth
Plumes of heat studied in thermal pollution tracking.
