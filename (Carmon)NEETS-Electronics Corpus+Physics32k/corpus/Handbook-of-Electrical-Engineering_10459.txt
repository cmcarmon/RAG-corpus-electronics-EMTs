In principle the dynamic behavior of the human element in man-machine systems can be described in terms
similar to those used to describe other system elements. There are, however, major complications in quantiﬁ-
 and
cation because of the enormous versatility of the human engaged, simultaneously, as the on-going 
modiﬁer of the man-machine system itself and as an operating entity within that system. In other words, the
adaptive and learning capabilities of the human permit both set-up and modiﬁcation of the effective system
structure and the subsequent self-improvement and tuning of the human dynamic characteristics within that
structure.
