In chemistry, an oxidising agent (oxidant, oxidiser) is a substance that has the ability to oxidise other substances — in other words to cause them to lose electrons. Common oxidising agents are oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and the halogens.
In one sense, an oxidising agent is a chemical species that undergoes a chemical reaction that removes one or more electrons from another atom. In that sense, it is one component in an oxidation–reduction (redox) reaction. In the second sense, an oxidising agent is a chemical species that transfers electronegative atoms, usually oxygen, to a substrate. Combustion, many explosives, and organic redox reactions involve atom-transfer reactions.
