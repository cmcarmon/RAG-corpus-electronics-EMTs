The general form of Characteristic Energy can be computed as:





C

3


=

v

∞


2






{\displaystyle C_{3}=v_{\infty }^{2}\,\!}

where





v

∞





{\displaystyle v_{\infty }\,}
is the orbital velocity when the orbital distance tends to infinity. Note that, since the kinetic energy is





1
2


m

v

2




{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}
, C3 is in fact equal to twice the magnitude of the specific orbital energy (



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
) of the escaping object.
