Now  that  we  have  mastered  series  and  parallel  RLC circuits,  we  are
prepared  to  apply  the  ideas  to  any  second-order  circuit  having  one  or
more independent sources with constant values. Although the series and
parallel  RLC circuits  are  the  second-order  circuits  of  greatest  interest,
other second-order circuits including op amps are also useful. Given a
second-order  circuit,  we  determine  its  step  response 
(which  may
x(t)
be voltage or current) by taking the following four steps:
