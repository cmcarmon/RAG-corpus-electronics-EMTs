In an electric ﬁeld, the electrons and holes acquire an add-
itional drift velocity caused by the electric ﬁeld, which is
superimposed on the chaotic thermally induced velocities. In
a uniform semiconductor and in a weak electric ﬁeld, F, the
drift velocities, vn and vp, of the electrons and holes are pro-
portional to the electric ﬁeld:
