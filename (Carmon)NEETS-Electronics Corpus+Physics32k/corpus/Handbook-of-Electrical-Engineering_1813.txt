Visual Thresholding and Contrast Sensitivity
Determining how sensitive an observer is to small changes in luminance is important in the design of video
systems. Oneâ€™s sensitivity will determine how visible noise will be and how accurately the luminance must be
represented.  The  contrast  sensitivity  is  determined  by  measuring  the  just-noticeable  difference  (JND)  as  a
