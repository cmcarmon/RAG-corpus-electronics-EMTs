When a certain minimum voltage is placed on the plate, the gas molecules in the envelope ionize.
This happens by a process that will be explained when gas diodes are studied. The positive ions tend to
cancel some of the effects of the space charge that influence plate resistance in a vacuum tube. This
canceling reduces internal plate resistance to a relatively low, constant value. In applications that require a
large plate current, the low plate resistance of a gas-filled diode has an efficiency that cannot be
approached by a high-vacuum diode.
