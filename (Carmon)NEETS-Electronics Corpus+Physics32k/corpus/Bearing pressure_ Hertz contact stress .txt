When the clearance can not be neglected, it is then necessary to know the value of the half contact angle θ0 , which can not be determined in a simple way and must be measured. When this value is not available, the Hertz contact theory can be used.
The Hertz theory is normally only valid when the surfaces can not conform, or in other terms, can not fit each other by elastic deformation; one surface must be convex, the other one must be also convex or plane. This is not the case here, so the results must be considered with great care. The approximation is only valid when the inner radius of the container R1 is far greater than the outer radius of the content R2, in which case the surface container is then seen as flat by the content. However, in all cases, the pressure that is calculated with the Hertz theory is greater than the actual pressure (because the contact surface of the model is smaller than the real contact surface), which affords designers with a safety margin for their design.
In this theory, the radius of the female part (concave) is negative.
A relative diameter of curvature is defined:

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{d^{*}}}={\frac {1}{d_{1}}}+{\frac {1}{d_{2}}}}

where d1 is the diameter of the female part (negative) and d2 is the diameter of the male part (positive). An equivalent module of elasticity is also defined:

where νi is the Poisson's ratio of the material of the part i and Ei its Young's modulus.
