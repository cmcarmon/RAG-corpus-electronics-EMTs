The kx, ky, and kz are complex constants that deﬁne a wave
number vector k. (A time-harmonic dependence of ejvt
is
assumed and suppressed.) The vector E0 deﬁnes the polariza-
tion of the plane wave. The real and imaginary parts of the
wave number vector k deﬁne the phase vector b and an
attenuation vector a. The phase vector has units of radians
per meter and gives the direction of most rapid phase change,
whereas the attenuation vector has units of nepers per meter
and gives the direction of most rapid attenuation. The magni-
tude of the phase vector gives the phase change per unit length
along the direction of the phase vector, and the magnitude of
the attenuation vector determines the attenuation rate along
the direction of the attenuation vector.
