Abstraction
In programming, abstraction refers to the separation of what needs to be done from the details of how to do
it. As it facilitates the separation of unrelated issues, it is a most powerful tool for making complex structures
comprehensible. There are two varieties: functional (procedural) abstraction and data abstraction.
