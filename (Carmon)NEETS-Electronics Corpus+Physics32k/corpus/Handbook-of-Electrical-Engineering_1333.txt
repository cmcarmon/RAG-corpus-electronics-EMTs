An MBE coder decomposes the instantaneous speech spectrum into subbands centered at harmonics of the
fundamental glottal excitation (pitch). The spectral envelope of the signal is approximated by samples taken at
pitch harmonics, and these harmonic amplitudes are compared to adaptive thresholds (which may be determined
via  analysis-by-synthesis)  to  determine  subbands  of  high  spectral  activity.  Subbands  that  are  determined  to  be
“voiced” are labeled, and their energies and phases are encoded for transmission. Subbands having relatively low
spectral activity are declared “unvoiced”. These segments are approximated by an appropriately ﬁltered segment
of white noise, or a locally dense collection of sinusoids with random phase. Careful tracking of the evolution of
individual spectral peaks and phases in successive frames is critical in the implementation of MBE-style coders.
An efﬁcient implementation of an MBE coder was adopted for the International Maritime Satellite (INMAR-
SAT)  voice  processor,  and  is  known  as  Improved-MBE,  or  IMBE  [Hardwick  and  Lim,  1991].  This  coder
optimizes several components of the general MBE architecture, including grouping neighboring harmonics for
subband  voicing  decisions,  using  non-integer  pitch  resolution  for  higher  speaker  ﬁdelity,  and  differentially
encoding the log-amplitudes of voiced harmonics using a DCT-based scheme. The IMBE coder requires high
delay (about 80 msec), but produces very good quality encoded speech.
