Figure 4.6 shows how the error in the Fourier series for the half-wave rectiÔ¨Åed sinusoid decreases as more
terms are incorporated. In particular, the use of four terms, as shown in the bottom plot of Figure 4.5, has
a rms error (relative to the rms value of the signal) of about 3%. The Fourier series in this case converges
quickly to the signal.
