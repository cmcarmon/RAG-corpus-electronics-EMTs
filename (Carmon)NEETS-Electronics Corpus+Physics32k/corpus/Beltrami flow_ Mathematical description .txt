Since the vorticity vector




ω



{\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } }
and the velocity vector




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
are parallel to each other, we can write





ω

v

=

,

ω
=

(

x

t
)

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } \times \mathbf {v} =0,\quad \omega =\alpha (\mathbf {x} ,t)\mathbf {v} }

where



α
(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \alpha (\mathbf {x} ,t)}
is some scalar function. One immediate consequence of Beltrami flow is that it can never be a planar or axisymmetric flow because in those flows, vorticity is always perpendicular to the velocity field. The other important consequence will be realized by looking at the incompressible vorticity equation

f


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\omega -(\omega \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =\nu \nabla ^{2}\omega +\nabla \times f}

where




f



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} }
is an external body forces such as gravitational field, electric field etc., and



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the kinematic viscosity. Since



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
and




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
are parallel, the non-linear terms in the above equation are identically zero

When
