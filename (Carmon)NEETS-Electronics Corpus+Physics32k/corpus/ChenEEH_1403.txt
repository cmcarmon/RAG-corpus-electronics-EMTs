On DISC 25% to 71% of the execution time is spent recon-
ﬁguring. Hauck et al. (1999) have studied techniques for
reducing reconﬁguration time on the Xilinx 6200 by compress-
ing the conﬁguration data stream. They have been able to
reduce reconﬁguration time 4-fold by using a device speciﬁc
feature called wildcarding. The approach by Shirazi et al.
(2000) also takes advantage of wildcarding, and they provide
an example in which reconﬁguration time has been reduced
from linear time with respect to size of the component to
constant time at best and logarithmic time at worst. More
recently, Li and Hauck (2001) described a method for com-
pressing conﬁguration data for Xilinx Virtex FPGAs that
exploits the regularity of the frame-based format of conﬁgu-
ration data.
