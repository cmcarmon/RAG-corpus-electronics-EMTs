The optical fiber is coupled to semiconductor photodiodes similarly to the way optical sources are
coupled to optical fibers. Fiber-to-photodiode coupling involves centering the flat fiber-end face over the
photodiode active area. This is normally done directly by butt coupling the fiber up to the photodiode
surface. As long as the photodiode active area is larger than that of the fiber core, fiber-to-detector
coupling losses are very low. In some cases a lens may be used to couple the fiber end-face to the
detector. However, this is not typically done.
