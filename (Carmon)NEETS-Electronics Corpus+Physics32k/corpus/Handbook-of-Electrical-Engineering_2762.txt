To achieve tight packing of cells within a row, adjacent cells (Fig. 25.29) are abutted against each other. Since
metal  interconnections  are  used  within  cells  (and  most  basic  cells  are  reused  throughout  the  design),  it  is
generally  not  possible  to  route  intercell  metal  interconnections  over  cells.  This  constraint  can  be  relaxed,  as
shown in Fig. 25.30(b), when additional metal layers are available, restricting a subset of the layers for intracell
use and allowing over-the-cell routing [Sherwani et al., 1995] with the other layers.
