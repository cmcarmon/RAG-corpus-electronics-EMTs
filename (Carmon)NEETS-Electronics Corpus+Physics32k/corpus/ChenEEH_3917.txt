Since the Bayesian estimators (MMSE and MAP estimates)
presented in the previous section are usually not linear, it
may be impractical to implement them. An alternative is to
restrict the consideration to only the class of linear estimators
and then ﬁnd the optimum estimatior in that class. As such,
the notion of optimality deviates from that of Bayesian esti-
mation, which minimizes the Bayes’ risk.
