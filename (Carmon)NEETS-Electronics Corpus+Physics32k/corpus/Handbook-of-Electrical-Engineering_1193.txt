If  the  vectors  x1,  x2,  .  .  .,  xq,  that  span  subspace  C  are  linearly  independent,  then  the  Gram  matrix  G  is
invertible and the linear system of equations (14.81) has a unique solution for the coefﬁcient vector a. On the
other hand, this linear system of equations will have an inﬁnity of coefﬁcient vector solutions when the {xk}
vectors are linearly dependent. Nevertheless, each of these coefﬁcient vector solutions lead to the same unique
optimum solution (14.80).
