{\displaystyle \Pi _{D}=-{1 \over A}\left({\frac {\partial G}{\partial x}}\right)_{T,V,A}}

where:
Πd - disjoining pressure, N/m2
A - the surface area of the interacting surfaces, m2
G - total Gibbs energy of the interaction of the two surfaces, J
x - distance, m
indices T, V and A signify that the temperature, volume, and the surface area remain constant in the derivative.

Using the concept of the disjoining pressure, the pressure in a film can be viewed as:




P

P

Π

D




{\displaystyle P=P_{0}+\Pi _{D}}

where:
P - pressure in a film, Pa
P0 - pressure in the bulk of the same phase as that of the film, Pa.
Disjoining pressure is interpreted as a sum of several interactions: dispersion forces, electrostatic forces between charged surfaces, interactions due to layers of neutral molecules adsorbed on the two surfaces, and the structural effects of the solvent.
Classic theory predicts that the disjoining pressure of a thin liquid film on a flat surface as follows,

For a solid-liquid-vapor system where the solid surface is structured, the disjoining pressure is affected by the solid surface profile, ζS , and the meniscus shape, ζL

In the theory of liquid drops and films, the disjoining pressure can be shown to be related to the equilibrium liquid-solid contact angle
