5. The Accelerating Anodeâ€”in the CRT, this anode is used to accelerate the electrons toward the
front of the tube. Its action is similar to the screen grid of tetrodes and pentodes. But remember,
while the screen grid in conventional tubes accelerates electrons toward the plate, its primary
purpose is to reduce interelectrode capacitance, NOT accelerate electrons.
