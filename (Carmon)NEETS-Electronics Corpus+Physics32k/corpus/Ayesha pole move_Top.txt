Ayesha is an advance Pole dance pose, where the dancer, suspends their body weight with two hands in an inverted position, and opens their legs in a V facing the pole.
There are several grip variations for Ayesha, including split grip, twisted grip, and elbow grip. There are different ways to get into Ayesha:
From a basic inversion, do a caterpillar to create space between the torso and the pole.
From an extended butterfly, bring the inside leg around toward your face.
Directly from a handspring.
