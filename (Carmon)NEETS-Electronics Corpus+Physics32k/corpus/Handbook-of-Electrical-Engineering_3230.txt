Phase-Controlled Converter DC Drive
Figure  30.41  shows  a  dc  drive  using  a  three-phase  thyristor  bridge  converter.  The  converter  rectiﬁes  line  ac
voltage to variable dc output voltage by controlling the ﬁring angle of the thyristors. With rated ﬁeld excitation,
as the armature voltage is increased, the machine will develop speed in the forward direction until the rated,
or  base,  speed  is  developed  at  full  voltage  when  the  ﬁring  angle  is  zero.  The  motor  speed  can  be  increased
further  by  weakening  the  ﬁeld  excitation.  Below  the  base  speed,  the  machine  is  said  to  operate  in  constant
