The exact waveform of figure 2-25, view (D), can be obtained by logic operations of timing and
data. This is illustrated in figure 2-26, where a timing signal [view (A)] is used rather than a carrier
frequency. The data (intelligence) is shown in view (B) and is combined with the timing signal to produce
a combination digital modulation signal, as shown in view (C). The square-wave pattern of the digital
modulation is filtered to limit the bandwidth of the signal frequencies, as shown in view (D). This system
has been used in some high-speed data equipment, but it offers no particular advantage over other systems
of modulation, particularly the pulse-modulated systems for high-speed data transmission.
