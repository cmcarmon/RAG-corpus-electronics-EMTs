sion. We can deﬁne similar packet processing delay at the
receiver in the reverse direction. Usually this delay is the
characteristic of the operating system (OS) and the multimedia
application under consideration. For a lightly loaded system,
this delay can be considered as negligible; however, with in-
creasing load, this delay can become signiﬁcant. Packet pro-
cessing delay is independent of the Internet model (whether
best-effort or any other enhanced version), and any reductions
in this delay would imply software enhancements to the OS
kernel—such OSs are called multimedia operating systems
(Steinmetz, 1995) that provide enhanced process-, resource-,
ﬁle-, and memory-management techniques with real-time
scheduling—and the application.
