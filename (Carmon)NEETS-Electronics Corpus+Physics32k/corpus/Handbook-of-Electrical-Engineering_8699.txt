RISC: Reduced instruction set computer, a name coined by Patterson et al. at the University of California at Berkeley
to describe a computer with an instruction set designed for maximum execution speed on a particular class
of  computer  programs.  Such  designs  are  characterized  by  requiring  separate  instructions  for  load/store
operations and arithmetic operations on data in registers. The earliest computers explicitly designed by these
rules were designs by Seymour Cray at CDC in the 1960s. The earliest development of the RISC philosophy
of design was given by John Cocke in the late 1970s at IBM. See CISC above for the contrasting approach.
