Broad dielectric transitions allow for a large operating temperature range. In the case of relaxors, this implies
a  large  difference  between  Tmax  and  Td.  Minimal  Eâ€“P  hysteresis  and  no  remanent  polarization  are  useful  in
achieving a low-loss material that is not susceptible to joule heating effects. These factors are listed in Table 50.2.
