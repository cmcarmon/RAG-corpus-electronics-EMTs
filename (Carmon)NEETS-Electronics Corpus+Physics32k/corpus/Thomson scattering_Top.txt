Thomson scattering is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free charged particle, as described by classical electromagnetism. It is just the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle kinetic energy and photon frequency do not change as a result of the scattering. This limit is valid as long as the photon energy is much less than the mass energy of the particle:

, or equivalently, if the wavelength of the light is much greater than the Compton wavelength of the particle.
