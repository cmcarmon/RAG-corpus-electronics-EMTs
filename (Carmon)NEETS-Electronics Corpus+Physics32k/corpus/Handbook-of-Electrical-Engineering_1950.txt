Look-Ahead Technique
The look-ahead technique is a very powerful technique for pipelining of recursive signal processing algorithms
[Parhi and Messerschmitt, 1989]. This technique can transform a sequential recursive algorithm to an equivalent
concurrent one, which can then be realized using pipelining or parallel processing or both. This technique has
been successfully applied to pipeline many signal processing algorithms, including recursive digital ﬁlters (in
direct  form  and  lattice  form),  adaptive  lattice  digital  ﬁlters,  two-dimensional  recursive  digital  ﬁlters, Viterbi
decoders, Huffman decoders, and ﬁnite state machines. This research demonstrated that the recursive signal
processing algorithms can be operated at high speed. This is an important result since modern signal processing
applications in radar and image processing and particularly in high-deﬁnition and super-high-deﬁnition tele-
vision video signal processing require very high throughput. Traditional algorithms and topologies cannot be
used  for  such  high-speed  applications  because  of  the  inherent  speed  bound  of  the  algorithm  created  by  the
feedback loops. The look-ahead transformation creates additional concurrency in the signal processing algo-
rithms and the speed bound of the transformed algorithms is increased substantially. The look-ahead trans-
formation  is  not  free  from  its  drawbacks.  It  is  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  the  hardware  overhead.  This
difﬁculty has encouraged us to develop inherently pipelinable topologies for recursive signal processing algo-
rithms. Fortunately, this is possible to achieve in adaptive digital ﬁlters using relaxations on the look-ahead or
by the use of relaxed look-ahead [Shanbhag and Parhi, 1992].
