The following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:
a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature.
a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work.
a measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.
In Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the Boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.
