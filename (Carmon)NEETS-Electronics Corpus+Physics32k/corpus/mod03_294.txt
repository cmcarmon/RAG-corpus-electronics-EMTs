As you have read, most of the problems associated with a direct short or excessive current concern
the heat generated by the higher current. The damage to circuit components, the possibility of fire, and the
possibility of hazardous fumes being given off from electrical components are consequences of excessive
heat. It is possible for excessive heat to occur without a direct short or excessive current. If the bearings
on a motor or generator were to fail, the motor or generator would overheat. If the temperature around an
electrical or electronic circuit were to rise (through failure of a cooling system for example), excessive
heat would be a problem. No matter what the cause, if excessive heat is present in a circuit, the possibility
of damage, fire, and hazardous fumes exists.
