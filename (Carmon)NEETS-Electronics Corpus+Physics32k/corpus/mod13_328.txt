Flip-flops are bistable multivibrators. The types used in digital equipment are identified by the
inputs. They may have from two up to five inputs depending on the type. They are all common in one
respect. They have two, and only two, distinct output states. The outputs are normally labeled Q and Q
and should always be complementary. When Q = 1, then Q  = 0 and vice versa.
