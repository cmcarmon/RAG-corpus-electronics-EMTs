Deﬁning Two-Port Networks
Electrical networks can also be used to transfer signals from
one port to another. Under this requirement, connections to
the network are made in two places, the input and the output.
For example, a transistor has an input between the base and
emitter and an output between the collector and emitter. We
can model such circuits as two-port networks as shown in
Fig. 3.50. Here we see the input port, represented by V1 and
I1,  and  the  output  port,  represented  by V2  and  I2.  Currents
are assumed positive if they ﬂow as shown in Fig. 3.50. The
same restrictions about external connections and internal sources mentioned above for the single port also apply.
Now  that  we  have  deﬁned  two-port  networks,  let  us  discuss  how  to  create  a  mathematical  model  of  the
network by establishing relationships among all of the input and output voltages and currents. Many possibilities
exist for modeling. In the next section we arbitrarily begin by introducing the z-parameter model to establish
the technique. In subsequent sections we present alternative models and draw relationships among them.
