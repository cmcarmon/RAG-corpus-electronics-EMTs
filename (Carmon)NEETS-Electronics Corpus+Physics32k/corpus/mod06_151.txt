In view (B), you see De Forest’s tube with +3 volts applied to the control grid. When De Forest
applied this voltage, he found that plate current, Ip, increased by a large amount. (We’ll say it doubled to
simplify the explanation.) You already know that the only way to double the plate current in a diode is to
increase the plate voltage by a large amount. Yet, De Forest had doubled plate current by applying only 3
volts positive to the control grid!
