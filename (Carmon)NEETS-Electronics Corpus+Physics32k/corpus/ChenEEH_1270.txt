Unlike RAM, read-only memory (ROM) cannot have the
contents rewritten once they are installed in a system. To
read from ROM, the random-addressing method similar to
RAM is used. In contrast to RAMs, ROMs have the advantage
of being nonvolatile, which means ROMs do not lose their
contents when the power to the system is turned off.
ROM chips are typically slower than both SRAM and DRAM
chips.
