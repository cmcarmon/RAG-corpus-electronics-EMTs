One device for measuring burning rate is a V shaped metal channel about 1â€“2 feet long wherein a sample is placed, with a cross-sectional dimension of approximately 6 mm or 1/4". The sample is ignited on one end and time is measured until the flame front gets to the other end. Burn rate (typically expressed in 'mm/s' or 'in/s') is the sample length over time at a given pressure and temperature. For solid fuel propellant, the most common method of measuring burn rate is the Crawford Type Strand Burning Rate Bomb System (also known as the Crawford Burner or Strand Burner), as described in MIL-STD-286C.
