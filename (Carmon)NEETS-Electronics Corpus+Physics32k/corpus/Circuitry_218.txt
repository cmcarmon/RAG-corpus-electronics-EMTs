Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To investigate reactance in an a.c. circuit. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  digital  or  analogue  meters  with  a.c. 
voltage  and  current  ranges,  sine  wave  signal 
generator  (with  an  output  impedance  of  50  F, or 
less),  1  ÂµF  capacitor,  60  mH  inductor  (with  low 
series loss resistance), test leads, connecting  wire.
