The difference signal is compressed to form the transmitted video signal (F). This compression is performed
both in the time and transform domains. Entropy coding of the type used in facsimile can be incorporated to
take spatial continuity into account (i.e., a picture usually does not change over the span of a single picture
element,  so  variations  of  “run  length”  coding  can  often  compress  the  data).  The  compression  technique
incorporates the MPEG-2 syntax. The actual compression algorithms (based on the discrete cosine transform)
are adaptive so a variety of formats can be accommodated (e.g., 1080-line interlaced scanning, 720-line pro-
gressive, bi-directional). The main feature is that the data rate is decreased by extracting essential parameters
that describe the waveform.
