Data movement instructions move data from 
one location to another within the microprocessor 
and memory (Figure 46-6). Data are moved 8 bits at 
a time, in a parallel fashion (simultaneously), from 
the source to the destination specified. Microproces-
sor instructions use a symbolic notation that refers to 
how the data are moving. In the 6800 and 6502 micro-
processors, the arrow moves from left to right. In the 
8080A and the Z80, the arrow moves from right to left. 
In either case, the message is the same. The data move 
from the source to the destination.
