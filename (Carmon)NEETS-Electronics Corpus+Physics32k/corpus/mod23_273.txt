Poor tape-to-head contact can seriously degrade the record and reproduce process. Magnetic heads
are designed to reduce tape-to-head gap as much as possible. A tape-to-head gap is extremely degrading at
the higher frequencies. Figure 6-3 shows this. Note how a .1-mil gap causes only a small loss at 10 kHz.
But, at 1 MHz, it causes a 46-dB loss! You must maintain tape-to-head contact. Keeping the magnetic
tape recorder heads and tape transport clean is the best way to do this.
