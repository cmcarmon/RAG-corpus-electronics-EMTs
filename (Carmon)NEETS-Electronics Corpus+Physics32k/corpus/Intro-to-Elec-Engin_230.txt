The circuit analysis techniques presented in Chapter 2 (where only resistive networks are
considered for the sake of simplicity) apply to ac circuits using the phasor method. However,
the constant voltages and currents in dc circuits are replaced by phasor voltages and currents
in ac circuits. Similarly, resistances and conductances are replaced by the complex quantities
for impedance and admittance. Nodal and mesh analyses, being well-organized and systematic
methods, are applied to ac circuits along with the concepts of equivalent circuits, superposition,
and wyeâ€“delta transformation.
