Built-in simulation capabilities.
 Many of today’s commercial systems have a non-linear simulation engine
directly built into the system, avoiding BEACON’s explicit translation step. Simulation results may then
also be directly displayed on or accessed from the original diagram (e.g., in the form of time histories).
This allows the user to see immediately the effects of any changes made to the diagram. One drawback
of this approach is that these non-compiled approaches all have some kind of threaded-code or inter-
pretative  model  execution,  leading  to  much  slower  simulations  than  explicitly  compiled  simulation
models such as those coming out of BEACON. Some systems allow for either of the two approaches.
The avoidance of an explicit netlist.
 Many systems have a monolithic architecture with no direct access
to the information in a modeled system. This prevents users from directly interfacing the block-diagram
editor to other tools or ﬁlters (as often performed on a quite
