The atoms of each element are made up of electrons, protons, and, in most cases, neutrons, which are
collectively called subatomic particles. Furthermore, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of one element
are identical to those of any other element. The reason that there are different kinds of elements is that the
number and the arrangement of electrons and protons within the atom are different for the different
elements
