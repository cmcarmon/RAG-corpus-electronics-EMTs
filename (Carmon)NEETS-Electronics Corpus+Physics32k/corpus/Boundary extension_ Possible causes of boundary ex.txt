There are many possible causes of boundary extension.  For example, source monitoring errors, perceptual schemas, and visual memory all partially can contribute to boundary extension because they are all related to how photos are initially processed and then later remembered.
A variety of types of objects and scenes also help facilitate boundary extension.  For example, simple scenes, a picture with one main object, and complex scenes, a picture with more than one main object, cause people to boundary extend. Photos that are really similar and that have either been zoomed a large amount or a small amount also elicit boundary extension. Furthermore, wide-angled scenes, pictures that show more of the background, and close-angled scenes, pictures that show less of the background, contribute to the boundary extension phenomenon. These scenes can be of animals, landscapes, people, or other objects. Scenes with rotated objects of varying degrees also elicit boundary extension. Moreover, 3-D models of rooms with furniture are conducive to boundary extension compared with 2-D scenes. Even neutral and emotional photos help cause boundary extension. Boundary extension occurs for scene pictures, objects in pictures with blank backgrounds, and line drawings. Outline-scenes and outline-objects elicit boundary extension. So, a variety of different scene stimuli cause boundary extension for the average person.
