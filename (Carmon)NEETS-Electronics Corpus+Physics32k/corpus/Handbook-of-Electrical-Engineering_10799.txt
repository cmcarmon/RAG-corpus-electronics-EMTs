The ideas of industrial ecology, which have begun to take root in the engineering community, have helped
to established a framework within which the industry can move toward realizing sustainable development. The
electrical,  electronics,  and  telecommunications  sectors  are  enablers  of  sustainability  because  they  allow  the
”  and
provision  of  increasing  quality-of-life  using  less  material  and  energy,  respectively,  “
decarbonization
”. This chapter will provide an introduction into industrial ecology and its implications for
“
the electronics industry. Current activities, initiatives, and opportunities will also be explored, illustrating that
the concomitant achievement of greater economic and environmental efﬁciency is indeed feasible in many cases.
