A  method  of  determining  the  direction  of  a 
 current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field uses 
the right-hand	motor	rule: When the thumb, in-
dex finger, and middle finger of the right hand are 
 extended at right angles to each other, the middle 
finger points in the direction of current flow in the 
conductor; the  index finger indicates the magnetic 
field from the north pole to the south pole; the 
thumb points in the direction of the motion of the 
conductor.
