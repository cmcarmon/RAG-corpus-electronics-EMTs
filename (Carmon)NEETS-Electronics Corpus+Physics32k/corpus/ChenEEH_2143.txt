Ohm’s law in equation 1.8 relates the conduction current J to
the electric ﬁeld E at every point in conductive material.
Because of collisions between the charge carriers (electrons)
comprising the current with the lattice of atoms forming the
conductive material, there will be a loss of electrical energy.
The power P delivered to electrical charges in a volume v is
given by Joule’s law:
