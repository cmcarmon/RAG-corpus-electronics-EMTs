Distances expressed in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within a single star system. So, for example:
One astronomical unit (au), the distance from the Sun to the Earth, is just under 5×10−6 parsecs.
The most distant space probe, Voyager 1, was 0.00066 parsecs from Earth as of August 2016. It took Voyager 1 39 years to cover that distance.
The Oort cloud is estimated to be approximately 0.6 parsecs in diameter
