By means of a limiter, either the positive or negative trigger pulses from the RC differentiator are
removed. This leaves trigger pulses of only one polarity. For example, the limiter in view A of figure 2-2
is a negative-lobe limiter; that is, the limiter removes the negative trigger pulses and passes only positive
trigger pulses to the radar transmitter.
