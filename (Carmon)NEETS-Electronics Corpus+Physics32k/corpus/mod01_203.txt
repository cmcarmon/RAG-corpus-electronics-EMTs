There are two types of primary cells, the wet cell and the dry cell. In a wet cell the electrolyte is a
liquid. A cell with a liquid electrolyte must remain in an upright position and is not readily transportable.
An automotive battery is an example of this type of cell. The dry cell, much more commonly used than
the wet cell, is not actually dry, but contains an electrolyte mixed with other materials to form a paste.
Flashlights and portable radios are commonly powered by dry cells.
