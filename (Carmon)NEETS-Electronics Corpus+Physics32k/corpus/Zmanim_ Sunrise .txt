Sunrise (הַנֵץ הַחַמָּה, Hanetz Hachamah) refers to when the ball of the sun rises above the horizon. Technically, it is preferable to pray the morning Shema just before this time and begin the Amidah just afterwards, although this is rarely done nowadays. Most mitzvot that must be performed during the day (such as the Four Species or Hallel) should be done after this time ab initio.
