production process. Because the fundamental equation of acoustics – the wave equation – applies here and
is linear, we can use linear systems in our model with a fair amount of accuracy. The naturalness of linear
system models for speech does not extend to other situations. In many cases, the underlying mathematics
governed by the physics, biology, and/or chemistry of the problem are nonlinear, leaving linear systems
models as approximations. Nonlinear models are far more diﬃcult at the current state of knowledge to
understand, and information engineers frequently prefer linear models because they provide a greater level
of comfort, but not necessarily a suﬃcient level of accuracy.
