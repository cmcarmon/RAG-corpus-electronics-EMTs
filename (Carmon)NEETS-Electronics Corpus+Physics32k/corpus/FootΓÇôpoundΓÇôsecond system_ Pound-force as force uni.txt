The technical or gravitational FPS system, is a coherent variant of the FPS system that is most common among engineers in the United States. It takes the pound-force as a fundamental unit of force instead of the pound as a fundamental unit of mass.
In this sub-system, the unit of mass is a derived unit known as the slug.

In the context of the gravitational FPS system, the pound-force (lbf) is sometimes referred to as the pound (lb).
