In this type of assay the binding of a ligand to cells is followed over time. The obtained signal is proportional to the number of ligands bound to a target structure, often a receptor, on the cell surface. Information about the ligand-target interaction is obtained from the signal change over time and kinetic parameters such as the association rate constant ka, the dissociation rate constant kd and the affinity KD can be calculated. By measuring the interaction directly on cells, no isolation of the target protein is needed, which can otherwise be challenging, especially for some membrane proteins. To ensure that the interaction with the intended target structure is measured appropriate biological controls, such as cells not expressing the target structure, are recommended.
Real-time measurements using label-free or label-based approaches have been used to analyze biomolecular interactions on fixated or on living cells.
The advantage of measuring ligand-receptor interactions in real-time, is that binding equilibrium does not need to be reached for accurate determination of the affinity.
