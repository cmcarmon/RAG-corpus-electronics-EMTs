Often during eyewitness testimonies the witness is interrogated about their particular view of an incident and often the interrogator will use leading questions to direct and control the type of response that is elicited by the witness. This phenomenon occurs when the response a person gives can be persuaded by the way a question is worded. For example, a person could be posed a question in two different forms:
"What was the approximate height of the robber?" which would lead the respondent to estimate the height according to their original perceptions. They could alternatively be asked:
"How short was the robber?" which would persuade the respondent to recall that the robber was actually shorter than they had originally perceived.
Using this method of controlled interrogation, the direction of a witness cross examination can often be controlled and manipulated by the individual who is posing questions in order to fit their own needs and intentions.
