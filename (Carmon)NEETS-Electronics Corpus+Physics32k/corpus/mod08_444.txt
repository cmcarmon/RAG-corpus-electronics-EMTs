Figures 3-36 and 3-37 both represent practical, workable saturable-core reactors. Circuits similar to
these are actually used to control lighting in auditoriums or electric industrial furnaces. These circuits are
sometimes referred to as magnetic amplifiers, but that is NOT technically correct. A magnetic amplifier
differs from a saturable-core reactor in one important aspect: A magnetic amplifier has a rectifier in
addition to a saturable-core reactor.
