When superflares were originally discovered on solar-type stars it was suggested that these eruptions may be produced by the interaction of the star's magnetic field with the magnetic field of a gas-giant planet orbiting so close to the primary that the magnetic fields were linked. Rotation or orbital motion would wind up the magnetic fields until a reconfiguration of the fields would cause an explosive release of energy. The RS Canum Venaticorum variables are close binaries, with orbital periods between 1 and 14 days, in which the primary is an F- or G-type main sequence star, and with strong chromospheric activity at all orbital phases. These systems have brightness variations attributed to large starspots on the primary; some show large flares thought to be caused by magnetic reconnection. The companion is close enough to spin up the star by tidal interactions.
A gas giant however would not be massive enough to do this, leaving the various measurable properties of the star (rotation speed, chromospheric activity) unchanged. If the giant and the primary were close enough for the magnetic fields to be linked, the orbit of the planet would wrap the field lines until the configuration became unstable followed by a violent release of energy in the form of a flare. Kepler discovered a number of closely orbiting gas giants, known as hot Jupiters; studies of two such systems showed periodic variations of the chromospheric activity of the primary synchronised to the period of the companion.
Not all planetary transits can be detected by Kepler, since the planetary orbit may be out of the line of sight to Earth. However, the hot Jupiters orbit so close to the primary that the chance of a transit is about 10%. If superflares were caused by close planets the 279 flare stars discovered should have about 28 transiting companions; none of them actually showed evidence of transits, effectively excluding this explanation.
