Principle of Operation.
For an illustration of the steady-state operation,
refer to Fig. 66.1 which shows a cross section of an ac machine. The rotor
consists of a winding wrapped around a steel body. A dc current is made
to  ﬂow  in  the  rotor  winding  (or  ﬁeld  winding),  and  this  results  in  a
magnetic ﬁeld (rotor ﬁeld). When the rotor is made to rotate at a constant
experience a period-
speed, the three stationary windings
ically varying magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, emf ’s are induced across these wind-
ings  in  accordance  with  Faraday’s  law.  These  emf ’s  are  ac  and  periodic;
each period corresponds to one revolution of the rotor. Thus, for 60-Hz
electricity,  the  rotor  of  Fig.  66.1  has  to  rotate  at  3600  revolutions  per
minute (rpm); this is the synchronous speed of the given machine. Because
are  displaced  equally  in  space  from  each
the  windings 
other (by 120 degrees), their emf waveforms are displaced in time by 1/3
of a period. In other words, the machine of Fig. 66.1 is capable of gener-
ating  three-phase  electricity.  This  machine  has  two  poles  since  its  rotor
ﬁeld resembles that of a bar magnet with a north pole and a south pole.
