It should be noted that with the ongoing increase in usage of various techniques to place IC dice directly on
circuit boards, Type III in some articles means a mix of packaged SMT ICs and bare die on the same board.
A Type I bare board will ﬁrst have solder paste applied to the component pads on the board. Once solder
paste has been deposited, active and passive parts are placed in the paste. For prototype and low-volume lines
this  can  be  done  with  manually  guided  X–Y  tables  using  vacuum  needles  to  hold  the  components,  while  in
medium and high-volume lines automated placement equipment is used. This equipment will pick parts from
