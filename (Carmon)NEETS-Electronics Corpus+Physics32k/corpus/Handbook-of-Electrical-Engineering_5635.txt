Power angle:  The electrical angle between the generated and terminal voltages of a synchronous generator.
Small disturbance:  A disturbance for which the equations for dynamic operation can be linearized for analysis.
Stability: The tendency of a power system (or a part of it) to develop torques to maintain its stable operation
