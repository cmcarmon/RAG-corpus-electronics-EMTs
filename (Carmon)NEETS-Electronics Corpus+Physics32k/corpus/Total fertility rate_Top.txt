The total fertility rate (TFR), sometimes also called the fertility rate, absolute/potential natality, period total fertility rate (PTFR), or total period fertility rate (TPFR) of a population is the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if:
She were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) through her lifetime, and
She were to survive from birth through the end of her reproductive life.
It is obtained by summing the single-year age-specific rates at a given time.
