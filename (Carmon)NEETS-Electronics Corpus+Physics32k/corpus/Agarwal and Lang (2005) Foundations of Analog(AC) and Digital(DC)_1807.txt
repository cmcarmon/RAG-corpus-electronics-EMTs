This exam-
ple shows how the maximum initial amplitude of the decaying sinusoid can be calculated
with ease when an initial state and a driving voltage are not present simultaneously. Sup-
pose we set the voltage drive to zero in our circuit in Figure 12.55, but we let all other
conditions remain the same. In other words, suppose that
