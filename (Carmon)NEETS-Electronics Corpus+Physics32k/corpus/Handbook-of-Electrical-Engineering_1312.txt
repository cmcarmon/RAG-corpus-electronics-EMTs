15.1 Coding, Transmission, and Storage
Stan McClellan and Jerry D. Gibson
Interest in speech coding is motivated by a wide range of applications, including commercial telephony, digital
cellular mobile radio, military communications, voice mail, speech storage, and future personal communica-
tions networks. The goal of speech coding is to represent speech in digital form with as few bits as possible
while maintaining the intelligibility and quality required for the particular application. At higher bit rates, such
as 64 and 32 kbits/s, achieving good quality and intelligibility is not too difﬁcult, but as the desired bit rate is
lowered to 16 kbits/s and below, the problem becomes increasingly challenging. Depending on the application,
many difﬁcult constraints must be considered, including the issue of complexity.
