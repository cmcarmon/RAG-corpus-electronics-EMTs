Stoneley waves are most commonly generated during borehole sonic logging and vertical seismic profiling. They propagate along the walls of a fluid-filled borehole. They make up a large part of the low-frequency component of the signal from the seismic source and their attenuation is sensitive to fractures and formation permeability. Therefore, analysis of Stoneley waves can make it possible to estimate these rock properties. The standard data processing of sonic logs to derive wave velocity and energy content is explained in  and.
