vC in Figure 12.6, vC leads iL by a quarter cycle. Thus, the greatest positive
slope in iL occurs at the positive peaks of vC, and the greatest negative slope
in iL occurs at the negative peaks of vC, in accordance with the constitutive
law for the inductor. Similarly, the greatest positive slope in vC occurs at the
negative peaks of iL, and the greatest negative slope in vC occurs at the positive
peaks of vC, in accordance with the constitutive law for the capacitor. So, each
state drives the growth of the other.
