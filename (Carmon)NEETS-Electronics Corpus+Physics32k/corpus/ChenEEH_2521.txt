The stubs attached to the main section of the transmission
line provide a useful alternative if there is a requirement to
reduce the circuit area. In addition, the use of stub impedance
tuners gives an extra degree of freedom in the choice of match-
ing strategies. This is because the lossless stub (open or short)
represents just a pure reactance to the main line (see Subsection
7.2.1 for more details) and can effectively be used for canceling
the loadâ€™s imaginary part. In general, two stub tuners together
with one line section are always enough to generate a complete
matching condition for any complex load. The position, char-
acteristic impedance, and line length of the stubs and the con-
necting lines are conveniently designed through the use of the
Smith chart. Once again, the bandwidth remains inherently
narrow because of the line length dependence of the impedance
transformer or the matching network in question.
