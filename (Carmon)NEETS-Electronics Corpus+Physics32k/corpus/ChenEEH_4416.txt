The linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem is an
optimal control problem where a quadratic cost function is
minimized when the plant has random initial conditions,
white noise disturbance input, and white measurement noise.
The typical implementation of the LQR solution requires that
the plant states be estimated, which can be posed as an LQG
problem. The plant is described by the following state and
output equations:
