In addition to there being two types of ﬁrst-order circuits (RC and
RL), there are two ways to excite the circuits. The ﬁrst way is by ini-
tial conditions of the storage elements in the circuits. In these so-called
source-free  circuits,  we  assume  that  energy  is  initially  stored  in  the
capacitive  or  inductive  element. The  energy  causes  current  to  ﬂow  in
the circuit and is gradually dissipated in the resistors. Although source-
free  circuits  are  by  deﬁnition  free  of  independent  sources,  they  may
have dependent sources. The second way of exciting ﬁrst-order circuits
is by independent sources. In this chapter, the independent sources we
will consider are dc sources. (In later chapters, we shall consider sinu-
soidal  and  exponential  sources.)  The  two  types  of  ﬁrst-order  circuits
and  the  two  ways  of  exciting  them  add  up  to  the  four  possible  situa-
tions we will study in this chapter.
