Unfortunately, this simple method of interfacing 
has a limitation when the state of a switch is being 
sensed  regularly  (e.g.  during  program  execution). 
However, a typical application which is unaffected 
by this problem is that of using one or more PCB 
mounted  switches  (e.g.  a  DIL  switch  package)  to 
configure  a  logic  system  in  one  of  a  number  of 
preset modes. In such cases, the switches would be 
set once only and the software would read the state 
of  the  switches  and  use  the  values  returned  to 
initially configure the system. Thereafter, the state 
of  the  switches  would  then  only  be  changed  in 
order  to  modify  the  operational  parameters  of  the 
system (e.g. when changing input sensors or output 
transducers).  A  typical  DIL  switch  input  interface 
to a digital input port is shown in Fig. 16.12.
