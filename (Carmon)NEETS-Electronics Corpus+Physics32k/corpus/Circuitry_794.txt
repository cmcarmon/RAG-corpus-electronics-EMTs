analyse logic and also ‘mixed-mode’ (i.e. analogue 
and  digital)  circuits.  Several  examples  of  digital 
logic  analysis  are  shown  in  Figs  17.17,  17.18  and 
17.19.  
  Figure  17.17  shows  a  four-stage  shift  register 
based  on  J-K  bistables.  The  result  of  carrying  out 
an analysis of this circuit is shown in Fig. 17.18.
