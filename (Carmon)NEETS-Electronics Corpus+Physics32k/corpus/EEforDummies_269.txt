Most fixed resistors are color‐coded with their nominal value and tolerance 
(see the “Reading into fixed resistors” section), but some resistors have their 
values stamped right onto the tiny package, along with a bunch of other 
letters and numbers guaranteed to 
cause confusion. If you aren’t sure of 
the value of a specific resistor, pull 
out your multimeter, set it to meas­
ure resistance in ohms, and place its 
probes across the resistor (either 
way), as shown in Figure 5­9. Make sure 
your resistor is not wired into a cir­
cuit when you measure its resistance; 
otherwise, you won’t get an accurate 
reading.
