Any power tool showing evidence of electrical problems should be immediately serviced
as well.
Iâ€™ve heard several horror stories of people who continue to work with hand tools
that periodically shock them. Remember, electricity can kill, and the death it brings can be
gruesome. Like extension cords, a bad power tool can be removed from service by unplugging
it and cutting off the plug at the end of the cord.
