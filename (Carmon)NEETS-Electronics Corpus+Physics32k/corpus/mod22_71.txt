On the other hand, the accuracy of a digital computer is governed by the number of significant 
figures carried in the computations. This, in turn, is determined by the computer's design. In a digital 
computer, the number of decimal places in the constant could be many, depending on the design of the 
computer processing unit. The digital computer is, therefore, capable of higher precision and accuracy. 
However, a computer, regardless of its accuracy, would do you no good if the wrong one were chosen for 
a given task.
