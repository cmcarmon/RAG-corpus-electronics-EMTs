Continuous-wave (cw) modulation consists of on-off keying of a carrier wave. To recover on-off
keyed information, we need a method of detecting the presence or absence of rf oscillations. The CW
DEMODULATOR detects the presence of rf oscillations and converts them into a recognizable form.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the received cw in view (A), the rectified cw from a diode detector in view (B), and
the dc output from a filter that can be used to control a relay or light indicator in view (C).
