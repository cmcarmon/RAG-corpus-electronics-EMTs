is an oriented graph such that the variable xj in S is represented by a node (also denoted by xj) in Gl, and
the coefﬁcient aij of the variable xj in S by a branch with a branch gain aij connected between nodes xi
and xj in Gl and directed from xj to xi. Furthermore, a source node l is included in Gl such that for each
constant bk in S there is a node with gain bk in Gl from node l to node sk. Graph Gij is the subgraph of
Gl obtained by ﬁrst removing all the outgoing branches from node xj and then short-circuiting node l
to  node  xj. A  loop  set  l  is  a  subgraph  of  Gl 0  that  contains  all  the  nodes  of  Gl 0  with  each  node  having
exactly one incoming and one outgoing branch. The product  p of the gains of all the branches in  l is
called a loop-set product. A 2-loop-set l2 is a subgraph of Glj containing all the nodes of Glj with each node
having exactly one incoming and one outgoing branch. The product p2 of the gains of all the branches
in l2 is called a 2-loop-set product.
