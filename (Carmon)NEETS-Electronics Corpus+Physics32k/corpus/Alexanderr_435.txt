2. We turn off the independent sources and Ô¨Ånd the form of the tran-
sient response 
by applying KCL and KVL. Once a second-order
differential  equation  is  obtained,  we  determine  its  characteristic
roots. Depending on whether the response is overdamped, critically
damped, or underdamped, we obtain 
with two unknown con-
xt(t)
stants as we did in the previous sections.
