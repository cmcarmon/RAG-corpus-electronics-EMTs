Signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion are similar to those of shock: the victim will appear ashen 
gray; the skin will be cold, moist, and clammy; and the pupils of the eyes may be dilated (enlarged). The 
vital (blood pressure, temperature, pulse, and respiration) signs usually are normal; however, the victim 
may have a weak pulse together with rapid and shallow breathing. Body temperature may be below 
normal.
