Like their matrix board counterparts, stripboards 
are  also  pierced  with  a  matrix  of  holes  which, 
again,  are  almost  invariably  placed  on  a  0.1  in 
pitch.  The  important  difference,  however,  is  that 
stripboards  have  copper  strips  bounded  to  one 
surface which link together rows of holes along the 
complete length of the board. The result, therefore, 
is  something  of  a  compromise  between  a  ‘naked’ 
matrix  board  and  a  true  printed  circuit.  Compared 
with  the  matrix  board,  the  stripboard  has  the 
advantage 
links  arc 
required and that components can be mounted and 
soldered  directly  to  the  copper  strips  without  the 
need for terminal pins.  
  Conventional  types  of  stripboard  (those  with 
parallel  runs  of  strips  throughout  the  entire  board 
surface)  are  generally  unsuitable  for  relatively 
complex  circuitry  of  the  type  associated  with 
microprocessor 
several 
manufacturers have responded with special purpose 
stripboards.  These  have  strips  arranged  in  groups 
which  not  only  permit  the  mounting  of  DIL 
integrated circuits (including the larger 28-pin and 
40-pin  types)  but  are  also  available  in  a  standard 
range of ‘card’ sizes (both single and double-sided 
and with and without plated through holes). Board 
designed  for  prototyping  using  integrated  circuits  
also tend to have sensibly arranged strips for supply 
distribution  together  with  edge  connectors  (either 
direct or indirect types) for use with microprocessor 
bus systems.
