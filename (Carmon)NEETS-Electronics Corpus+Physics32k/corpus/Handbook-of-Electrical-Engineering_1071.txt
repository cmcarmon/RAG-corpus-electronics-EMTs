Properties of the DTFT
Since  the  DTFT  is  a  close  relative  of  the  classical  CT  Fourier  transform,  it  should  come  as  no  surprise  that
many properties of the DTFT are similar to those of the CT Fourier transform. In fact, for many of the properties
presented  earlier  there  is  an  analogous  property  for  the  DTFT.  The  following  list  parallels  the  list  that  was
presented in the previous section for the CT Fourier transform, to the extent that the same property exists. A
more complete list of DTFT pairs is given in Table 14.4:
