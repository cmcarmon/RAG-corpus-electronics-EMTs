The ventilation rate, for CII buildings, is normally expressed by the volumetric flowrate of subaerial air, introduced to the building. The typical units used are cubic feet per minute (CFM) or liters per second (L/s). The ventilation rate can also be expressed on a per person or per unit floor area basis, such as CFM/p or CFM/ftÂ², or as air changes per hour (ACH).
