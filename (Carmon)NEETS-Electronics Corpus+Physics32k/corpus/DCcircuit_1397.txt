attached to a source of voltage, drawing maximum current as it begins to build a charge. Over
time, the capacitorâ€™s terminal voltage rises to meet the applied voltage from the source, and
the current through the capacitor decreases correspondingly. Once the capacitor has reached
the full voltage of the source, it will stop drawing current from it, and behave essentially as an
open-circuit.
