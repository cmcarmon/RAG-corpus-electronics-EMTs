Another bistable circuit is the schmitt trigger 
(Figure 40-30). One application of the Schmitt trigger 
is to convert a sine wave, sawtooth, or other irregularly 
shaped waveform to a square or rectangular wave. The 
circuit differs from a conventional bistable multivibra-
tor in that a common-emitter resistor (R3) replaces 
one of the coupling networks. This provides additional 
regeneration for quicker action and straighter leading 
and trailing edges on the output waveform.
