An operating system is simply a set of programs and routines that lets you and other programs use 
the computer. A digital computer uses one central set of programs called the operating system to manage 
execution of other programs and to perform common functions like read, write, or print. Other programs, 
or you the user, can order the operating system to perform these common functions. These orders are 
called system calls when other programs use them, or simply commands when you put them through the 
keyboard.
