is limited at lower frequency by the physical size of the planar
antenna;
typically, resonant-type antennas even on high-
permittivity substrates will be a few fractions of a free space
wavelength. However, at microwave- and millimeter-wave fre-
quencies, smaller wavelength causes this approach to be attrac-
tive for an integrated system with maximum performance.
