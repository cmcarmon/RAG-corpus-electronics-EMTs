In mathematics, in the phase portrait of a dynamical system, a heteroclinic orbit (sometimes called a heteroclinic connection) is a path in phase space which joins two different equilibrium points. If the equilibrium points at the start and end of the orbit are the same, the orbit is a homoclinic orbit.
Consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE







x
˙



=
f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}=f(x)}


Suppose there are equilibria at



x
=

x

0




{\displaystyle x=x_{0}}
and



x
=

x

1




{\displaystyle x=x_{1}}
, then a solution



ϕ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \phi (t)}
is a heteroclinic orbit from




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
to




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
if




ϕ
(
t
)
→

x

0




a
s


t
→
−
∞


{\displaystyle \phi (t)\rightarrow x_{0}\quad \mathrm {as} \quad t\rightarrow -\infty }


and




ϕ
(
t
)
→

x

1




a
s


t
→
+
∞


{\displaystyle \phi (t)\rightarrow x_{1}\quad \mathrm {as} \quad t\rightarrow +\infty }


This implies that the orbit is contained in the stable manifold of




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
and the unstable manifold of




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
.
