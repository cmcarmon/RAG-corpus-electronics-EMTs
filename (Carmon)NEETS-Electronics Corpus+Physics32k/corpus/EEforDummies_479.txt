will induce one volt when the current changes its rate of flow by one ampere 
per second. One henry is much too large for everyday electronics, so you’re 
more likely to hear about millihenrys (mH), because inductance measured in 
thousandths of a henry is more commonplace. You’ll also run across micro-
henrys (μH), which are millionths of a henry.
