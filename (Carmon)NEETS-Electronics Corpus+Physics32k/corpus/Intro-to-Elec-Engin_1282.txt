The communication channel (transmission medium) is the physical medium that is utilized to
send the signal from the transmitter to the receiver. In wireless transmission, such as microwave
radio, the transmission medium is usually the atmosphere or free space. Telephone channels, on
the other hand, employ a variety of physical media such as wire lines and optical Ô¨Åber cables.
Irrespective of the type of physical medium for signal transmission, the essential feature is that
the transmitted signal is corrupted in a random manner by a variety of possible mechanisms. For
simplicity, the effects of these phenomena (attenuation, distortion, interference, noise, etc.) are
shown at the center of Figure 14.1.1, since the transmission medium is often the most vulnerable
part of a communication system, particularly over long distances.
