In most three-dimensional electrodynamic problems, the
unknown function of an integral equation is the electric surface
current density, which is a vector function. For such an un-
known, basis functions must be constructed properly based on
the properties of the current density. One of the most popular
basis functions for this purpose is the so-called rooftop func-
tion. For a rectangular mesh in the x–y plane, the basis function
for the x component of the current density is deﬁned as:
