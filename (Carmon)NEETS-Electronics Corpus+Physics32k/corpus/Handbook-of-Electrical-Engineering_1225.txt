Singular Value Decomposition
The singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real- or complex-valued matrix plays an increasingly important
role  in  contemporary  signal  processing  applications.  For  a  generally  complex-valued  matrix  A ˛  Cm  ·  n,  its
associated SVD representation takes the form of the following sum of r weighted outer products,
