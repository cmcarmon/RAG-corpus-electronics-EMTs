One advantage of magnetic tape is that you can erase what you’ve previously recorded, and record
on the same tape again and again. The erasing is done by demagnetizing the magnetic tape. You
demagnetize a magnetic tape by exposing it to a gradually decreasing ac (alternating current) magnetic
field. There are two ways to do this: (1) with an erase head that’s mounted on the magnetic recorder, or
(2) with a separate tape degausser.
