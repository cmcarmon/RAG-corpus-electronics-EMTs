For a particle moving in a curve, the cross product of its angular velocity ω (a pseudovector) and position x give its tangential velocity

which cannot exceed a magnitude of c, since in SR the translational velocity of any massive object cannot exceed the speed of light c. Mathematically this constraint is 0 ≤ |u| < c, the vertical bars denote the magnitude of the vector. If the angle between ω and x is θ (assumed to be nonzero, otherwise u would be zero corresponding to no motion at all), then |u| = |ω||x|sinθ and the angular velocity is restricted by

The maximum angular velocity of any massive object therefore depends on the size of the object. For a given |x|, the maximum upper limit occurs when ω and x are perpendicular, so that θ = π/2 and sinθ = 1.
For a rotating rigid body rotating with an angular velocity ω, the u is tangential velocity at a point x inside the object. For every point in the object, there is a maximum angular velocity.
The angular velocity (pseudovector) is related to the angular momentum (pseudovector) through the moment of inertia tensor I

(the dot · denotes tensor contraction on one index). The relativistic angular momentum is also limited by the size of the object.
