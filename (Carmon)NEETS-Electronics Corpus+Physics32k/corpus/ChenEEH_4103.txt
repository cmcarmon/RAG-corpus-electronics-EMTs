The zero-forcing equations do not account for the effects of
noise. In addition, the ﬁnite-length transversal ﬁlter equalizer
can minimize worst-case ISI only if the peak distortion is less
than 100% of the eye opening. Another type of equalizer is the
minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizer. In these
equalizers, coefﬁcients are selected to minimize the mean
square error that consists of the sum of the square of all the
ISI terms plus noise power at the equalizer output. The MMSE
equalizer maximizes the signal-to-distortion ratio at its output
within the constraints of equalizer length and delay.
