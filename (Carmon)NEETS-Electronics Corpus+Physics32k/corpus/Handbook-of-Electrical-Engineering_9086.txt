That  is  the  frequently  used  expression  describing  intelligent  chip  cards.  The  word  “intelligent”  plays  an
important role, as there are also other, very popular chip cards that can hardly be named that way — memory
cards containing deﬁned amounts of available memory and some access control logic. One can ﬁnd them today
as the most consumed commodity articles: prepaid services cards. A good example would be a telephone card,
preloaded with some electronic “money” when manufactured, debited each time one makes a phone call and,
ﬁnally, thrown out when emptied. Even if interesting as technology solution this type of card won’t be a subject
of next chapters as this article is rather dedicated to intelligent members of chip card’s family — Smart Cards.
