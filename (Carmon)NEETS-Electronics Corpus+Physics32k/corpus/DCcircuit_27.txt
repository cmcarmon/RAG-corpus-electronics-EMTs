One pioneering researcher, Benjamin Franklin, came to the conclusion that there was only
one ﬂuid exchanged between rubbed objects, and that the two different ”charges” were nothing
more than either an excess or a deﬁciency of that one ﬂuid. After experimenting with wax and
wool, Franklin suggested that the coarse wool removed some of this invisible ﬂuid from the
smooth wax, causing an excess of ﬂuid on the wool and a deﬁciency of ﬂuid on the wax. The
resulting disparity in ﬂuid content between the wool and wax would then cause an attractive
force, as the ﬂuid tried to regain its former balance between the two materials.
