Because the matrix Pz depends on K , the covariance analysis
can be repeated for different gain sequences to compare the
predicted performance of the alternative implementations. For
given gain sequences, the covariance analysis can be repeated
for different values of Fx, Qd, and R to determine the sensitiv-
ity of the performance to the design assumptions.
