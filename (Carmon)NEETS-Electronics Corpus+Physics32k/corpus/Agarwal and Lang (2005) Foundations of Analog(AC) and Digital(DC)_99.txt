We cannot make this problem go away by postulating constant currents
and voltages, since we are very much interested in situations such as those
depicted in Figure 1.7, in which a time-varying voltage source drives a circuit.
Instead, we fix the problem created by the finite propagation speeds of
electromagnetic waves by adding the third constraint, namely, that the timescale
of interest in our problem be much larger than electromagnetic propagation
delays through our elements. Put another way, the size of our lumped elements
must be much smaller than the wavelength associated with the V and I signals.10
Under these speed constraints, electromagnetic waves can be treated as if
they propagated instantly through a lumped element. By neglecting propagation
