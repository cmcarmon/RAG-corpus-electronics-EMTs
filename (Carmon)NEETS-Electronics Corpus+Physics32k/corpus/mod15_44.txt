Synchros work in teams. Two or more synchros interconnected electrically form a synchro system. 
There are two general classifications of synchro systemsâ€”TORQUE SYSTEMS AND CONTROL 
SYSTEMS. Torque-synchro systems use torque synchros and control-synchro systems use control 
synchros. The load dictates the type of synchro system, and thus the type of synchro.
