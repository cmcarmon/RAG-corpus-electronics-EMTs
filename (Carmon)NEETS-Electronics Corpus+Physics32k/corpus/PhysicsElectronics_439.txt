The thin and lightly doped central region is known as the base (B) and has majority
charge carriers of opposite polarity to those in the surrounding material. The two outer
regions are known as the emitter (E) and the collector (C). Under the proper operating
conditions the emitter will emit or inject majority charge carriers into the base region, and
because the base is very thin, most will ultimately reach the collector. The emitter is highly
doped to reduce resistance. The collector is lightly doped to reduce the junction capacitance
of the collector-base junction.
