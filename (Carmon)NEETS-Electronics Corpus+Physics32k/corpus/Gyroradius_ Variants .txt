It is often useful to give the gyrofrequency a sign with the definition





Ω

g


=



q
B

m




{\displaystyle \Omega _{g}={\frac {qB}{m}}}

or express it in units of Hertz with





f

g


=

B

π
m





{\displaystyle f_{g}={\frac {qB}{2\pi m}}}
.
For electrons, this frequency can be reduced to

{\displaystyle f_{g,e}=(2.8\times 10^{10}\,\mathrm {Hertz} /\mathrm {Tesla} )\times B}

In cgs units, the gyroradius is given by

{\displaystyle r_{g}={\frac {mcv_{\perp }}{|q|B}}}

and the gyrofrequency is

{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light in vacuum.
