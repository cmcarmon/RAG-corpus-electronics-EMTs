To determine the Norton parameters for some circuit, again two indepen-
dent measurements are required. The source parameter isc could be found by
applying a short to the circuit terminals and measuring the resultant current.
The resistance parameter is measured as before in Equation 3.117. Note that
the source parameters isc, voc are related by Equation 3.122, so measuring or
calculating any two of voc, isc and Rt is sufficient to characterize both the Norton
and the Th√©venin model. In particular, it is often convenient to find Rt from
two simple terminal measurements on the circuit
