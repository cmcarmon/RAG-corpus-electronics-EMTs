Medium-  and  Low-Bay  Areas.
Seeing  tasks  in  medium-  and  low-bay  areas  are  usually  more  difÔ¨Åcult  than
those encountered in the high-bay areas. Increasing the size and reducing the brightness of the luminaires will
improve visual comfort and will improve the visibility of specular objects. It may not improve the visibility of
diffuse three-dimensional objects.
