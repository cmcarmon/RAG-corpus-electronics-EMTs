At the first instant of time, 100 volts is applied to the medium time-constant circuit. In this circuit, 
1TC is exactly equal to the duration of the input pulse. After 1TC the capacitor has charged to 63.2 
percent of the input voltage (100 volts). Therefore, at the end of 1TC (100 microseconds), the voltage 
across the capacitor is equal to 63.2 volts. However, as soon as 100 microseconds has elapsed, and the 
initial charge on the capacitor has risen to 63.2 volts, the input voltage suddenly drops to 0. It remains 
there for 100 microseconds. The capacitor will now discharge for 100 microseconds. Since the discharge 
time is 100 microseconds (1TC), the capacitor will discharge 63.2 percent of its total 63.2-volt charge, a 
value of 23.3 volts. During the next 100 microseconds, the input voltage will increase from 0 to 100 volts 
instantaneously. The capacitor will again charge for 100 microseconds (1TC). The voltage available for 
this charge is the difference between the voltage applied and the charge on the capacitor (100 - 23.3 
volts), or 76.7 volts. Since the capacitor will only be able to charge for 1TC, it will charge to 63.2 percent 
of the 76.7 volts, or 48.4 volts. The total charge on the capacitor at the end of 300 microseconds will be 
23.3 + 48.4 volts, or 71.7 volts.
