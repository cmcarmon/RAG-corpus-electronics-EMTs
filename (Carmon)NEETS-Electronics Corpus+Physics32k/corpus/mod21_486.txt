To determine the proper amplitude so that the modulation will not cause distortion or splatter, you 
use the audio two-tone modulation test. The resulting signals are shown in views A, B, and C of figure 5-
6. The two-tone test is used for initial adjustment and for precise checking because it will indicate 
distortion. The two-tone test corresponds to the wave envelope method of AM modulation checking. Two 
signals of equal amplitude but of slightly different frequencies beating together are applied to the 
sideband modulator input to produce a single tone of approximately 1,000 hertz. On an oscilloscope, the
