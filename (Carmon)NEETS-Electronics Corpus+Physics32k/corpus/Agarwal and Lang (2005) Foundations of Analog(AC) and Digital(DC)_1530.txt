Find and sketch the response for t > 0 in each network in
Figure 10.67. Assume that the input is as shown for t > 0 , and assume an initial zero
state (in other words, show the zero state response).

For the current source shown in Figure 10.68, assume iS
consists of a single rectangular current pulse of amplitude I0 amps and duration t0
seconds.
