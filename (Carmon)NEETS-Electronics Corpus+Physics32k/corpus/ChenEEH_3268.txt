Thus, the voltage gain in an ideal transformer is simply the
ratio of the primary and secondary windings’ turns. A practical
transformer experiences several non-ideal effects. Speciﬁcally,
these include nonzero winding resistance, ﬁnite permeability
of the core, eddy currents that ﬂow in the core, hysteresis (the
effect arising from the energy required to reorient the magnetic
dipoles as the magnetic polarity changes), and magnetic satur-
ation. For steady-state studies of the large system, linear circuit
models are desired. These effects are typically modeled as a
combination of series and parallel impedances in the following
way:
