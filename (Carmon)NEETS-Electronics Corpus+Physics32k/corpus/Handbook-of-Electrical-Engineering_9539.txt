An object is usually a member of a class. The class speciﬁes the internal structure and the external interface
of an object. New object classes can be deﬁned as a specialization of existing ones. For example, in a university
environment,  the  object  type “faculty”  can  be  seen  as  a  specialization  of  the  object  type “employee.”  Since  a
faculty  is  a  university  employee,  it  has  all  the  properties  of  a  university  employee  plus  some  of  its  own.  For
example,  some  of  the  general  operations  that  can  be  performed  on  an  employee  could  be  “raise_salary,”
“ﬁre_employee,” “transfer_employee.”  For  a  faculty,  specialized  operations  such  as “faculty_tenure”  could  be
deﬁned. Faculty can be viewed as a subclass of employee. As a result, faculty (the subclass) will respond to the
same messages as employee (the superclass) in addition to those deﬁned speciﬁcally for faculty. This technique
is known as inheritance. A subclass is said to inherit the behavior of its superclass.
