In the term rf amplifier, the "rf" stands for radio frequency. These amplifiers are designed to amplify 
frequencies between 10 kHz and 100,000 MHz. A single amplifier will not amplify the entire rf range, but 
any amplifier whose frequency band is included in the rf range is considered an rf amplifier.
