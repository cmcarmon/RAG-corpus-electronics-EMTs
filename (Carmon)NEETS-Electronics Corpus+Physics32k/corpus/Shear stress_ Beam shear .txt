Beam shear is defined as the internal shear stress of a beam caused by the shear force applied to the beam.

{\displaystyle \tau ={fQ \over Ib},}

where
f = total shear force at the location in question;
Q = statical moment of area;
b = thickness (width) in the material perpendicular to the shear;
I = Moment of Inertia of the entire cross sectional area.
The beam shear formula is also known as Zhuravskii shear stress formula after Dmitrii Ivanovich Zhuravskii who derived it in 1855.
