In  a  strong  magnetic  ﬁeld  (wct  >>  1)  the  absorption  of  microwave  radiation  is  peaked  at w = wc. At  this
frequency  the  photon  energy  is  equal  to  the  distance  between  two  Landau  levels,  i.e.,  \w  =  ES+1  –  ES  with
reference to Eq. (22.13). This effect, known as cyclotron resonance, is used to measure the effective masses of
charge carriers in semiconductors [in a simplest case of isotropic E(k) dependence, m*n = qB/wc].
