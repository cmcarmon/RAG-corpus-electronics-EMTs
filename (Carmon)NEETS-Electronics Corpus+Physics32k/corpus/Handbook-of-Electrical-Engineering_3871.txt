For general-interest articles on antennas the reader is directed to the IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine.
In addition to providing up-to-date articles on current issues in the antenna ﬁeld, this magazine also provides
easy-to-read  tutorials.  For  the  latest  research  advances  in  the  antenna  ﬁeld  the  reader  is  referred  to  the IEEE
Transactions on Antennas and Propagation. In addition, a number of very good textbooks are devoted to antennas.
The books by Collin and by Stutzman and Thiele were especially useful in the preparation of this section.
