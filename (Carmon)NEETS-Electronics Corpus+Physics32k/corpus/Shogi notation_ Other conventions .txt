Game moves in western notation are always numbered (unlike Japanese game records). Additionally, what is numbered are pairs of two moves – the first move by Black, the second by White – instead of numbering each move by each player. This also differs from the Japanese system. For instance, three pairs of moves (or six individual moves) are numbered as 1. P-76 P-34 2. P-26 P-44 3. S-48 S-32. However, in the British Shogi magazine of the 1970s and 1980s, the pair number convention was not used for tsumeshogi problems, in which case the each player's move is number just as in the Japanese notation conventions.
Following western chess conventions, omitted moves are indicated with an ... ellipsis. As a consequence of the way moves are numbered in the western system, all moves by White are notated with an ellipsis prefix in texts. For example, ...P-55 indicates a move by White while P-55 indicates a move by Black. In handicap games, White plays first, so Black's first move is replaced by an ellipsis. For example, 1. ...G-32 2. P-76 G-72.
Unlike western chess, game states like check or checkmate are not typically notated. However, the use of question marks and exclamation points to indicate questionable and good moves, respectively, are occasionally used.
