The first development allowing the operational wavelength to move from 850 nm to 1300 nm was
the introduction of multimode graded-index fibers. Multimode graded-index fibers have substantially
lower intermodal dispersion than multimode step-index fibers. Systems operating at 850 nm cannot take
full advantage of the fiber's low intermodal dispersion because of high chromatic dispersion at 850 nm.
However, the use of multimode graded-index fibers allow 850-nm LEDs to operate satisfactorily in
short-distance, higher bandwidth systems.
