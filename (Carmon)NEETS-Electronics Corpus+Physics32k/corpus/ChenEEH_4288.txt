Advances in optical networking will increase the capacity of
a core network by stufﬁng vastly more information into each
ﬁber. Next-generation media interface protocols, such as SIP
and MEGACO, have already proven more effective than SS7
and H.323 in a convergence network of wireless systems, wire-
line systems, and the Internet.
