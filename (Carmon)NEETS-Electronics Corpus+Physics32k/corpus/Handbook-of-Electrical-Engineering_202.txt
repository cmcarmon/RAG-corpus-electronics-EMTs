A mathematical model of an electric circuit contains ideal models of physical circuit elements. Some of these
ideal circuit elements (e.g., the resistor, capacitor, inductor, and transformer) were discussed previously. Here
we will deÔ¨Åne and examine both ideal and practical voltage and current sources. The terminal characteristics of
these models will be compared to those of actual sources.
