Three examples of a semiclassical approximation include:
WKB approximation: electrons in classical external electromagnetic fields
semiclassical gravity: quantum field theory within a classical curved gravitational background (see general relativity)
quantum chaos
In quantum field theory, in the semiclassical approximation only Feynman diagrams with at most a single closed loop (see for example one-loop Feynman diagram) are considered, which corresponds to the powers of Planck's constant. In chaos theory, the observation semiclassical approximations is a topic of current research.
