Filter: Filter,  in  smart  card  technology,  deﬁnes  an  additional  block  of  code  loaded  to  the  card’s  EEPROM
whose  function  is  to  either  enhance  the  existing  card’s  functionality  or  patch  found  bugs.  In  the  ﬁrst
case, you can see it as the development “pilot” that allows the manufacturer to check new releases before
its industrial launch. In the second case, a “ﬁlter” is the easiest way to debug and ﬁx existing application
or OS. When checked, veriﬁed, and approved, the “ﬁlter” is moved to ROM and remasked.
