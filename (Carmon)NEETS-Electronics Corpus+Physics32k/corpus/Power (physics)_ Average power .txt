As a simple example, burning one kilogram of coal releases much more energy than does detonating a kilogram of TNT, but because the TNT reaction releases energy much more quickly, it delivers far more power than the coal. If ΔW is the amount of work performed during a period of time of duration Δt, the average power Pavg over that period is given by the formula





P

.


{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {avg} }={\frac {\Delta W}{\Delta t}}\,.}

It is the average amount of work done or energy converted per unit of time. The average power is often simply called "power" when the context makes it clear.
The instantaneous power is then the limiting value of the average power as the time interval Δt approaches zero.

{\displaystyle P=\lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}P_{\mathrm {avg} }=\lim _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\Delta W}{\Delta t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} W}{\mathrm {d} t}}\,.}

In the case of constant power P, the amount of work performed during a period of duration T is given by:

In the context of energy conversion, it is more customary to use the symbol E rather than W.
