Nodal analysis deals routinely with current sources. When we have voltage sources along
with series resistances, the source-transformation technique may be used effectively to convert
the voltage source to a current source, as seen in Example 2.2.1. However, in cases where we have
constrained nodes, that is, the difference in potential between the two node voltages is constrained
by a voltage source, the concept of a supernode becomes useful for the circuit analysis, as shown
in the following illustrative example.
