Assume:
a is the acceleration due to thrust (the time-rate at which delta-v is spent)
g is the gravitational field strength
v is the velocity of the rocket
Then the time-rate of change of the specific energy of the rocket is




v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {a} }

The change of the specific energy of the rocket per unit change of delta-v is

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathbf {v\cdot a} }{|\mathbf {a} |}}}

which is |v| times the cosine of the angle between v and a.
Thus, when applying delta-v to increase specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction of v, and when |v| is large. If the angle between v and g is obtuse, for example in a launch and in a transfer to a higher orbit, this means applying the delta-v as early as possible and at full capacity. See also gravity drag. When passing by a celestial body it means applying thrust when nearest to the body. When gradually making an elliptic orbit larger, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis.
When applying delta-v to decrease specific orbital energy, this is done most efficiently if a is applied in the direction opposite to that of v, and again when |v| is large. If the angle between v and g is acute, for example in a landing (on a celestial body without atmosphere) and in a transfer to a circular orbit around a celestial body when arriving from outside, this means applying the delta-v as late as possible. When passing by a planet it means applying thrust when nearest to the planet. When gradually making an elliptic orbit smaller, it means applying thrust each time when near the periapsis.
