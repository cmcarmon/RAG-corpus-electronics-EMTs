The Bahamas officially observe both Eastern Standard Time during the winter months and Eastern Daylight Time during the summer months. Cuba is usually the same, with Eastern Standard Time in the winter, and Eastern Daylight Time in the summer, but it often changes on different days. Cayman Islands, Haiti, and Jamaica use Eastern Standard Time year-round. The Turks and Caicos Islands used to follow eastern time with daylight saving but switched in 2015 to the Atlantic Time Zone.
