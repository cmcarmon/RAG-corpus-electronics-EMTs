The value of Manning’s n is affected by many variables. Factors like suspended load, sediment grain size, presence of bedrock or boulders in the stream channel, variations in channel width and depth, and overall sinuosity of the stream channel can all affect Manning’s n value. Biological factors have the greatest overall effect on Manning’s n; bank stabilization by vegetation, height of grass and brush across a floodplain, and stumps and logs creating natural dams are the main observable influences.
