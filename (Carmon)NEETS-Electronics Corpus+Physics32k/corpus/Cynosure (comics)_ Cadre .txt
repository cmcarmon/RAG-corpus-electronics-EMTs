Following the Demon Wars, an elite force called Cadre was created. Its simple mandate was to protect the city. As such agencies often do, Cadre grew out of its initial mandate and its members (particularly its leader, Mayfair) became fanatically devoted to acting in accordance with their personal perception of the best interest of the city. Mayfair was one of those demon-possessed during Dancer's second rebellion but was destroyed shortly thereafter.
