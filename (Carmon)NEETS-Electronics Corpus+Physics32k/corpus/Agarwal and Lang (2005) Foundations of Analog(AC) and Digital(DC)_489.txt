Let us first determine the value of e using superposition. By the method of superposi-
tion, the voltage e can be determined by summing the responses of each of the sources
acting alone. We will first obtain ev, the response of the voltage source acting alone.
The subcircuit corresponding to the voltage source acting alone is shown in Figure 3.40.
Notice we have turned the current source off by open-circuiting it.
