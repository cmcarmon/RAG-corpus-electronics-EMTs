Perhaps the most common use of declarative languages is for construction of expert systems [Smith, 1988].
These  kinds  of  applications  are  typically  diagnostic.  That  is,  they  derive  a  conclusion  based  on  assertions  of
fact. An electrical circuit board might be diagnosed with an expert system that takes symptoms of the ailing
board as its input and derives a conclusion based on rules of electronic circuits—human rules of thumb given
it by an experienced technician—and declarative reasoning. In this example, the rules are constraints expressed
as declarations. The expert system program may derive more than one solution to the problem because many
solutions may ﬁt the constraints.
