Despite its abstract nature, almost every one of us has direct experience with ﬁelds, at
least in the form of magnets. Have you ever played with a pair of magnets, noticing how they
attract or repel each other depending on their relative orientation? There is an undeniable
force between a pair of magnets, and this force is without ”substance.” It has no mass, no
color, no odor, and if not for the physical force exerted on the magnets themselves, it would
be utterly insensible to our bodies. Physicists describe the interaction of magnets in terms of
magnetic ﬁelds in the space between them. If iron ﬁlings are placed near a magnet, they orient
themselves along the lines of the ﬁeld, visually indicating its presence.
