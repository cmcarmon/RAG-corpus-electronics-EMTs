Conclusions
In this chapter we have reviewed the tools available for the computer-aided design of control systems. The main
features of the current state-of-the-art are analysis tools built around a “matrix environment” and modeling,
simulation, and code generation tools constructed around the block diagram representation. For the most part,
control  systems  analysis  and  design  is  done  from  a  textual  interface  and  modeling,  simulation,  and  code
generation rely on a graphical user interface. There are links between the two “environments”, usually provided
by some form of linearization.
