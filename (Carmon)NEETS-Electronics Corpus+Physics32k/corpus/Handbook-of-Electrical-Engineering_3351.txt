The area of semiconductor-based integrated optics has attracted much attention worldwide because if offers
the potential of integrating electronic circuitry, optical sources and detectors, and optical waveguides on a single
substrate. While being quite promising, the technology is still 5 years away from commercialization. Technical
problems  in  semiconductor-based  integrated  optics  include  low  electrooptic  coefÔ¨Åcients,  higher  optical
waveguide attenuation, and an incompatibility of the processing steps needed to fabricate the various types of
devices on a single substrate. However, considerable attention is being paid to these problems, and improve-
ments are continually occurring.
