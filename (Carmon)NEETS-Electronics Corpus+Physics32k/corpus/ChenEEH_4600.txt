1998; Zhang and Jiang, 1999; Laparo et al., 1991), complete
online fault detection and diagnosis are still impossible at
present due to the inherent complexity of the problems and
the time constraint in online operations. Until the invention
of breakthrough technology for FDD, from the realistic point
of view, ﬁnding a better trade-off solution for real implemen-
tation based on contemporary technology is the best an engi-
neer can do. Moreover, from the system online safety point of
view, false alarms are always preferable over missed detection.
Thus, a conservative fault-detection scheme with least compu-
tational cost is a good choice to guarantee avoidance of missed
detection in online situations. The problem of failure isolation
is even more difﬁcult to solve when there is more than one
fault involved. Similarly, the conservative diagnostic attitude
should be preferable since the price of the misdiagnosis and
mistreatment could be instability and unaffordable loss.
A possible cost-effective and conservative fault-detection and
diagnosis schemes used in the later online simulation section is
shown in equations 8.29 and 8.30, respectively:
