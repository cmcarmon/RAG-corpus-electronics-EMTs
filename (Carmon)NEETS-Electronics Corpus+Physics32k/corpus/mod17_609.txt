The principle of the laser is somewhat similar to that of a very high-Q cavity resonator. Chapter 1 of 
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles, explains cavity resonators. The laser is shock-excited by a 
spark transmitter. This transmitter is called a spark transmitter because it uses the discharge of a capacitor 
through an inductor and a spark gap as a source of rf. While the input energy of the laser covers a wide 
band of frequencies, the output is on one frequency. Energy outputs of the laser are either INCOHERENT 
or COHERENT. For example, if you turn on a transmitter with no modulation, you will get coherent 
radiation. When you connect a noise source to an antenna, the result is incoherent radiation.
