A combination of solar cells and storage batteries is a better prime power source. This is a practical 
choice, even though the result is far from an ideal power source. About ten percent of the energy of the 
sunlight that strikes the solar cells is converted to electrical power. This low rate is sometimes decreased 
even further. You find this when the solar cells are bombarded by high-energy particles that are 
sometimes found in space.
