(cid:1) A major advantage to the state variable point of view is that any arbi-
trary ZIR can be added to any ZSR solution we have already worked out.
Thus any transient problem with zero initial conditions can be easily gener-
alized to one with arbitrary initial conditions. This concept will be illustrated
in the examples in Section 10.6.
