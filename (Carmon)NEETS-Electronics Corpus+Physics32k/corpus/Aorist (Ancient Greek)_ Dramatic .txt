In dialogues within tragedy and comedy, the first person singular aorist or present expresses an action performed by the act of speaking, like thanking someone (see performative utterance), or, according to another analysis, a state of mind. This is called tragic or dramatic aorist. The aorist is used when the action is complete in the single statement; the present when the speaker goes on to explain how or why he is acting.

Sausage-seller. I like your threats, laugh at your empty bluster,dance a fling, and cry cuckoo all around.
Aristophanes, The Knights 696–697: translated by William James Hickie
