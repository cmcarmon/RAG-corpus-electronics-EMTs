the most sensitivity.
If you’re not sure what range to select, start with the broadest range 
and dial it down later if the measurement falls in a lower range. In the 
resistor‐LED circuit (refer to Figure 16-7), the maximum voltage you can 
expect to measure is equal to the supply voltage, which is nominally 6 V. 
Select a range of 10 V or 20 V (meaning 0–10 V or 0–20 V), depending on 
what your multimeter offers.
