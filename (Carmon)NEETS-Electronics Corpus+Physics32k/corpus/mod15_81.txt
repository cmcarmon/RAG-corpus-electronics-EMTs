Synchros, as stated earlier, are simply variable transformers. They differ from conventional 
transformers by having one primary winding (the rotor), which may be rotated through 360ยบ and three 
stationary secondary windings (the stator) spaced 120ยบ apart. It follows that the magnetic field within the 
synchro may also be rotated through 360ยบ. If an iron bar or an electromagnet were placed in this field and 
allowed to turn freely, it would always tend to line up in the direction of the magnetic field. This is the 
basic principle underlying all synchro operations.
