For CC-NUMA systems, an important task for the operating
system is to exploit temporal and spatial locality of data to
reduce the need for remote storage access. For instance, spatial
locality can be improved by organizing application data into
pages to be stored locally to the processor. Another technique
is to support page migration: pages in virtual memory can be
moved to a node that requires them frequently.
