Most  of  the  technologically  important  piezoresistive  materials,  e.g.,  silicon,  germanium,  and  polycrystalline
ﬁlms, are centrosymmetric. The effect of center of symmetry (i.e., the inversion operator) on Eq. (51.3) is to
force all odd rank tensor coefﬁcients to zero; hence, the only contribution to the resistivity change under stress
will result from the piezoresistive term. Therefore, Eq. (51.3) takes the form
