The integrators can be obtained from the circuits n Figure
4.2 by adding a second input. As drawn in Figure 4.13(C), the
inverting integrators point upward and the noninverting inte-
grators downward. We used this orientation for the circuits in
Figure 4.14. Apart from the sign, both circuits realize the same
two-input lossy integrator functions,
