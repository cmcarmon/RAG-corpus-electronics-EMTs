In physics a force field is a vector field that describes a non-contact force acting on a particle at various positions in space. Specifically, a force field is a vector field






F
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}
, where






F
→



(



x
→



)


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}({\vec {x}})}
is the force that a particle would feel if it were at the point






x
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}
.
