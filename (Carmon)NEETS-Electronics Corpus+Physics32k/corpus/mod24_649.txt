As with the LED, not all of the photons produced are emitted from the laser diode. Some of the
photons are absorbed and the energy dissipated as heat. The emission process and the physical
characteristics of the diode cause the light output to be coherent, have a narrow spectral width, and have a
narrow output pattern.
