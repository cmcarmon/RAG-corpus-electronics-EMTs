When a narrow (collimated) beam passes through a volume, the beam will lose intensity due to two processes: absorption and scattering.
Mass absorption coefficient, and mass scattering coefficient are defined as







μ

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mu _{\mathrm {a} }}{\rho _{m}}},\quad {\frac {\mu _{\mathrm {s} }}{\rho _{m}}},}

where
μa is the absorption coefficient;
μs is the scattering coefficient.
