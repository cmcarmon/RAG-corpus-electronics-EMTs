Figure 9.7 represents one of the simplest models used to model real inter-
connects. For more accuracy, since we can use as many additional lumped
elements as we wish, we can arbitrarily approach the distributed modeling
limit, although in general this is not necessary. For example, the two models
shown in Figure 9.8 do a better job of modeling reality. The interconnect model
in Figure 9.8a is a ‘‘’’ model in which the resistance and inductance is placed
between the split capacitance. The interconnect model in Figure 9.8b is a ‘‘T’’
model in which the capacitance is placed between the split resistance and induc-
tance. As discussed in Section 9.3.1, we will adopt a similar lumped modeling
approach to the capacitances at work within the MOSFET.
