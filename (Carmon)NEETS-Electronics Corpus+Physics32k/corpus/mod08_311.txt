From time two (T2) to time three (T3), input signal number one goes negative and input signal
number two goes to zero. The difference between them stays constant at -1 volt. Therefore, the output
signal stays at a +10-volt level for the entire time period from T2 to T3. At T3 the bias condition will be:
