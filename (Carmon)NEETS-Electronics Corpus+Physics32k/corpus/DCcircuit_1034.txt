The Thevenin equivalent circuit, if correctly derived, will behave exactly the same as the
original circuit formed by B1, R1, R3, and B2. In other words, the load resistor (R2) voltage and
current should be exactly the same for the same value of load resistance in the two circuits.
The load resistor R2 cannot “tell the difference” between the original network of B1, R1, R3, and
B2, and the Thevenin equivalent circuit of ET hevenin, and RT hevenin, provided that the values
for ET hevenin and RT hevenin have been calculated correctly.
