The COMMON-EMITTER DETECTOR is often used in receivers to supply an amplified detected
output. The schematic for a typical transistor common-emitter detector is shown in figure 3-7. Input
transformer T1 has a tuned primary that acts as a frequency-selective device. L2 inductively couples the
input modulation envelope to the base of transistor Q1. Resistors R1 and R2 are fixed-bias voltage
dividers that set the bias levels for Q1. Resistor R1 is bypassed by C2 to eliminate rf. This RC
combination also acts as the load for the diode detector (emitter-base junction of Q1). The detected audio
is in series with the biasing voltage and controls collector current. The output is developed across R4
which is also bypassed to remove rf by C4. R3 is a temperature stabilization resistor and C3 bypasses it
for both rf and af.
