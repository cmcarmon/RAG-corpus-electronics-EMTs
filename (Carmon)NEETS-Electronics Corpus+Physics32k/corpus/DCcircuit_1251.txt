Practically speaking, however, capacitors will eventually lose their stored voltage charges
due to internal leakage paths for electrons to ﬂow from one plate to the other. Depending on
the speciﬁc type of capacitor, the time it takes for a stored voltage charge to self-dissipate can
be a long time (several years with the capacitor sitting on a shelf!).
