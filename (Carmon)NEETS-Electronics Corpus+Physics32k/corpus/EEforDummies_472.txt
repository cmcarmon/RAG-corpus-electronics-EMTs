Inducing current with a magnet
Hmmm . . . if electricity running through a wire produces a magnetic field, 
what happens if you place a closed loop of wire near a permanent magnet? 
Actually, nothing happens — unless you move the magnet. A moving mag-
netic field will induce a voltage across the ends of the wire, causing current to 
flow through the wire. Electromagnetic induction seems to make current magi-
cally appear — without any direct contact with the wire. The strength of the 
current depends on a lot of things, such as the strength of the magnet, the 
number of flux lines intercepted by the wire, the angle at which the wire cuts 
across flux lines, and the speed of the magnet’s motion. You can increase 
your chances of inducing a strong current by wrapping the wire into a coil 
and placing the magnet through the center (core) of the coil. The more turns 
of wire you wrap, the stronger the current will be.
