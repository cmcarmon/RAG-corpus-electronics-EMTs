Physical phenomena associated with these two modes can be
very different. The TEz mode can support propagating electro-
magnetic ﬁelds bound closely to, or guided by, the surface of a
metal structure (the ‘‘creeping wave’’ being a classic example
for curved metal surfaces). On the other hand, the TMz mode
sets up an E-ﬁeld which must be negligible at a metal surface.
This diminishes or eliminates bound or guided near-surface
propagating waves for metal surfaces. The presence or absence
of surface-type waves can have important implications for
scattering and radiation problems.
