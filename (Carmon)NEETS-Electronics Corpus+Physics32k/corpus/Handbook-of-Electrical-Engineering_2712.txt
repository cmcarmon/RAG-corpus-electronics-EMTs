This process of generating new partitions and keeping track of the best encountered partition is repeated until
no free cells are left. At this point of the process, which is called a pass, the algorithm returns the best partition
and terminates. To obtain better partitions, the algorithm can be modiﬁed such that more passes occur. This
can easily be done by selecting the best partition of a pass as the initial partition of the next pass. In this partition,
however, all cells are free. The modiﬁed algorithm terminates whenever a new pass returns a partition that is no
better than the partition returned by the previous pass. This way, the number of passes generated will never be
more than the number of the interconnections in the circuit and the algorithm always terminates.
