FETs (particularly MOSFETs) have become much more popular than bipolar 
transistors for use in integrated circuits (ICs), which I discuss in Chapter 11, 
where thousands of transistors work together to perform a task. That’s 
because they’re low‐power devices whose structure allows thousands of 
N‐ and P‐channel MOSFETs to be crammed like sardines on a single piece of 
silicon (that is, semiconductor material).
