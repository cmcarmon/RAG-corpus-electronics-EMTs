Next, in order to include the core losses, since these depend directly upon the level of ﬂux
density and hence the voltage V1, a resistance RC is added in parallel to j Xm, as shown in Figure
11.3.2(b). Then the resistance R1 of the coil itself and the leakage reactance X1, representing
the effect of leakage ﬂux associated with the coil, are included in Figure 11.3.2(c) as a series
impedance given by R1 + j X1.
