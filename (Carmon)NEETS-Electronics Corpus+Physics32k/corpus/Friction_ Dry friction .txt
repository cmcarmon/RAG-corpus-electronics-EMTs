Dry friction resists relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. The two regimes of dry friction are 'static friction' ("stiction") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction (sometimes called sliding friction or dynamic friction) between moving surfaces.
Coulomb friction, named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, is an approximate model used to calculate the force of dry friction. It is governed by the model:

{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\leq \mu F_{\mathrm {n} },}

where





F

{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {f} }\,}
is the force of friction exerted by each surface on the other. It is parallel to the surface, in a direction opposite to the net applied force.




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the coefficient of friction, which is an empirical property of the contacting materials,





F


n






{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {n} }\,}
is the normal force exerted by each surface on the other, directed perpendicular (normal) to the surface.

, and the direction of the frictional force against a surface is opposite to the motion that surface would experience in the absence of friction. Thus, in the static case, the frictional force is exactly what it must be in order to prevent motion between the surfaces; it balances the net force tending to cause such motion. In this case, rather than providing an estimate of the actual frictional force, the Coulomb approximation provides a threshold value for this force, above which motion would commence. This maximum force is known as traction.
The force of friction is always exerted in a direction that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note that it is not the direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.
