The SHAPE algorithm is a multicenter analog of SHAKE for constraining rigid bodies of three or more centers. Like SHAKE, an unconstrained step is taken and then corrected by directly calculating and applying the rigid body rotation matrix that satisfies:





L

rigid



(

t
+



Δ
t

2



)

=

L

nonrigid



(

t
+



Δ
t

2



)



{\displaystyle L^{\text{rigid}}\left(t+{\frac {\Delta t}{2}}\right)=L^{\text{nonrigid}}\left(t+{\frac {\Delta t}{2}}\right)}

This approach involves a single 3x3 matrix diagonalization followed by three or four rapid Newton iterations to determine the rotation matrix. SHAPE provides the identical trajectory that is provided with fully converged iterative SHAKE, yet it is found to be more efficient and more accurate than SHAKE when applied to systems involving three or more centers. It extends the ability of SHAKE like constraints to linear systems with three or more atoms, planar systems with four or more atoms, and to significantly larger rigid structures where SHAKE is intractable. It also allows rigid bodies to be linked with one or two common centers (e.g. peptide planes) by solving rigid body constraints iteratively in the same basic manner that SHAKE is used for atoms involving more than one SHAKE constraint.
