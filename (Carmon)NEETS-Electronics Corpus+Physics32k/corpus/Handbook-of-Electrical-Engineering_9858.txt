equalizer is unity. It is generally not desirable that w
3 as this indicates a high-frequency gain greater
than 1, and this will require an active network, or gain, and a passive equalizer. It is a fact that we should always
be able to realize a linear minimum phase network using passive components only if the network has a rational
transfer function with a gain magnitude that is no greater than 1 at any real frequency.
