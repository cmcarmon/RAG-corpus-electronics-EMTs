Probability of detection, PD, measures the likelihood of detecting an event or object when the event does occur.
Probability of false alarm, Pfa, is a measure of the likelihood of saying something happened when the event did
NOT occur. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves plot PD versus Pfa for a particular (sonar signal)
processing  system. A  single  plot  of  PD  versus  Pfa  for  one  system  must  ﬁx  the  SNR  and  processing  time.  The
threshold  h  is  varied  to  sweep  out  the  ROC  curve.  The  curve  is  often  plotted  on  either  log-log  scale  or
“probability” scale. In comparing a variety of processing systems one would like to select the system (or develop
a new one) that maximizes the PD for every given Pfa. Processing systems must operate on their ROC curves,
but most processing systems allow the operator to select where on the ROC curve the system is operated by
adjusting a threshold; low thresholds ensure a high probability of detection at the expense of high false alarm
rate. A sketch of two monotonically increasing ROC curves is given in Fig. 19.14. By proper adjustment of the
decision threshold, one can trade off detection performance for false alarm performance. Since the points (0,0)
and (1,1) are on all ROC curves, one can always guarantee 100% probability of detection with an arbitrarily
low threshold (albeit at the expense of 100% probability of false alarm) or 0% probability of false alarm with
an arbitrarily high threshold (albeit at the expense of 0% probability of detection). The (log) likelihood detector
is a detector that achieves the maximum probability of detection for ﬁxed probability of false alarm; it is shown
in  Fig.  19.15  for  detecting  Gaussian  signals  reﬂected  or  radiated  from  the  stationary  objects  modeled  in
Fig. 19.13.  For  moving  objects  more  complicated  time  compression  or  Doppler  compensation  processing  is
