Not	all	circuits	are	alike.	In	fact,	one	of	the	most	common	misconceptions	involves
an	electric	circuit	and	an	electronic	circuit;	both	are	said	to	be	one	and	the	same,
but	they	are	not.	While	the	former	can	carry	average	to	high	voltage,	the	latter	has
the	tendency	to	have	low	voltage	load.
Moreover,	it	is	always	important	to	be	aware	of	the	different	circuit	types,
especially	if	youâ€™re	about	to	make	your	own	circuit;	the	kind	of	circuit	that	you
create	needs	to	have	the	ability	to	handle	a	preferred	load.
