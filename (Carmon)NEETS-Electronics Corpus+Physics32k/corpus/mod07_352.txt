In figure 3-48, a small reverse-bias voltage is applied to the gate of the JFET. A gate-source voltage 
(VGG) of negative 1 volt applied to the P-type gate material causes the junction between the P- and N-type 
material to become reverse biased. Just as it did in the varactor diode, a reverse-bias condition causes a
