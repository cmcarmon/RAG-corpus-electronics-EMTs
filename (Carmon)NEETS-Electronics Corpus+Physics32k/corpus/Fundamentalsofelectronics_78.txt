A signal x (t) is routed to two (or more) systems, with this signal appearing as the input to all systems
simultaneously and with equal strength. Block diagrams have the convention that signals going to more
than one system are not split into pieces along the way. Two or more systems operate on x (t) and their
outputs are added together to create the output y (t). Thus, y (t) = S1 ]x (t)] + S2 [x (t)], and the information
in x (t) is processed separately by both systems.
