In general, binding energy represents the mechanical work that must be done against the forces that hold an object together, disassembling the object into component parts separated by sufficient distance that further separation requires negligible additional work.
In bound systems, if the binding energy is removed from the system, it must be subtracted from the mass of the unbound system, because this energy has mass. Thus, if energy is removed (or emitted) from the system at the time it is bound, the loss of energy from the system will also result in the loss of the mass of the energy from the system. System mass is not conserved in this process because the system is "open" (i.e., is not an isolated system to mass or energy input or loss) during the binding process.
There are several types of binding energy, each operating over a different distance and energy scale. The smaller the size of a bound system, the higher its associated binding energy.
