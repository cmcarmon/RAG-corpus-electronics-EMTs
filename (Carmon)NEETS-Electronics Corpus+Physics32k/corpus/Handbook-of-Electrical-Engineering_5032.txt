The  thin  ﬁlm  of  Si3N4  is  characterized  by  extremely  low  losses,  and  its  relatively  closed  structure  does  not
provide any latitude for free sodium movement, thereby providing complete passivation of the semiconductor
device. The high dielectric strength of the double ﬁlm layer of SiO2 and Si3N4 renders it dielectrically effective
in ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET) applications.
