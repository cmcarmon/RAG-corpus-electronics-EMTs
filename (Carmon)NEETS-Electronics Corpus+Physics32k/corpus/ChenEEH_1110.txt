Most of these foundries have all the facilities in-house to
produce complete MEMS devices. The wide variety of mate-
rials and processes that can be designed into MEMS means,
however, that it is not always possible to Ô¨Ånd all the needed
tools under one roof. Hence, several years ago, the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency instituted a new type of
foundry service called the MEMS-Exchange. This organization
contracts with diverse industrial and academic fabrication
facilities for a wide range of services, such as deposition of
zinc oxide piezoelectric materials. The MEMS designer can
draw from any of the facilities and processes. A completed
design and funding are sent to the MEMS-Exchange, which
handles scheduling, production, billing, and other factors,
such as the protection of proprietary designs.
