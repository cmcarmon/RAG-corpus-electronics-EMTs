From your study of oscillators, you should know that the oscillator will oscillate at the resonant 
frequency of the tank circuit. Although the tank circuit is resonant at a particular frequency, many other 
frequencies other than the resonant frequency are present in the oscillator. These other frequencies are 
referred to as HARMONICS. A harmonic is defined as a sinusoidal wave having a frequency that is a 
multiple of the fundamental frequency. In other words, a sine wave that is twice that fundamental 
frequency is referred to as the SECOND HARMONIC.
