to form a closed circuit, the steady-state currents in these windings are also periodic. These currents create magnetic
ﬁelds of their own. Each of these ﬁelds is pulsating with time because the associated current is ac; however, the
. This revolving ﬁeld arises from the space displacements of the
combination of the three ﬁelds is a 
windings and the phase differences of their currents. This combined magnetic ﬁeld has two poles and rotates at
the same speed and direction as the rotor. In summary, for a loaded synchronous (ac) generator operating in a
steady state, there are two ﬁelds rotating at the same speed: one is due to the rotor winding and the other due to
the stator windings. It is important to observe that the armature circuits are in fact exposed to two rotating ﬁelds,
one of which, the armature ﬁeld, is caused by and in fact tends to counter the effect of the other, the rotor ﬁeld.
The result is that the induced emf in the armature can be reduced when compared with an unloaded machine
(i.e., open-circuited stator windings). This phenomenon is referred to as
