The  most  widely  used  marine  radio  aid  in  1997  was  Loran-C  (see  Table 109.1).  The  100-kHz  signals  are

United States, parts of western Europe, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and a few other areas. The former Soviet Union
has a compatible system called Chaika. The vehicle-borne receiver measures the difference in time of arrival of
pulses emitted by two stations, thus locating the vehicle on one branch of a hyperbola. Two or more station
pairs give a two-dimensional position ﬁx whose typical accuracy is 0.25 nmi, limited by propagation uncer-
tainties over the terrain between the transmitting station and the user. The measurement of 100-microsecond
