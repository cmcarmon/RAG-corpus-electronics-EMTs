In this case the dispersion relation allows for two modes: a barotropic mode where the free surface amplitude is large compared with the amplitude of the interfacial wave, and a baroclinic mode where the opposite is the case â€“ the interfacial wave is higher than and in antiphase with the free surface wave. The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.
