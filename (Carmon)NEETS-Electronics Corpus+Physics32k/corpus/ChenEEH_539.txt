In the radiative recombination processes, recombining
electron-hole pairs emit
light, and the energy released
during this recombination process is transformed into the
energy of photons. Since during band-to-band recombina-
tion,
the energy released by each recombining electron-
hole pair is either equal to the energy gap or is slightly
higher, the frequency of the emitted radiation can be estimated
as:
