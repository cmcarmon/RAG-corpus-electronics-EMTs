An analemma is a diagram that shows the annual variation of the Sun's position on the celestial sphere, relative to its mean position, as seen from a fixed location on Earth. (The word analemma is also occasionally, but rarely, used in other contexts.) It can be considered as an image of the Sun's apparent motion during a year, which resembles a figure-8. An analemma can be pictured by superimposing photographs taken at the same time of day, a few days apart for a year.
An analemma can also be considered as a graph of the Sun's declination, usually plotted vertically, against the equation of time, plotted horizontally. Usually, the scales are chosen so that equal distances on the diagram represent equal angles in both directions on the celestial sphere. Thus 4 minutes (more precisely 3 minutes, 56 seconds), in the equation of time, are represented by the same distance as 1° in the declination, since Earth rotates at a mean speed of 1° every 4 minutes, relative to the Sun.
An analemma is drawn as it would be seen in the sky by an observer looking upward. If north is shown at the top, then west is to the right. This is usually done even when the analemma is marked on a geographical globe, on which the continents, etc., are shown with west to the left.
Some analemmas are marked to show the position of the Sun on the graph on various dates, a few days apart, throughout the year. This enables the analemma to be used to make simple analog computations of quantities such as the times and azimuths of sunrise and sunset. Analemmas without date markings are used to correct the time indicated by sundials. They have little practical usefulness.
