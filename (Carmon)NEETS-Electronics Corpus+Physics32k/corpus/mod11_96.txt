As the electrons drift into the field-free area beyond the buncher cavity, bunches continue to form 
because of the new velocity relationships between the electrons. Unless the beam is acted upon by some 
other force, these bunches will tend to form and disperse until the original beam distribution is eventually 
reformed. The net effect of velocity modulation is to form a current-density modulated beam that varies at 
the same rate as the grid-signal frequency. The next step is to take useful power from the beam.
