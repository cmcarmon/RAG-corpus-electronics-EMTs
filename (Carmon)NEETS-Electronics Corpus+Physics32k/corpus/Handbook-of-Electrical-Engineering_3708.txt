Modeling  the  recording  process  involves  convolving  the  head  ﬁeld  contours  with  the  very  nonlinear  and
hysteretic  magnetic  properties  of  the  recording  medium.  A  typical  M-H  hysteresis  loop  for  a  longitudinal
magnetic recording medium is shown in Fig. 36.11. Whether the medium has positive or negative magnetization
depends upon not only the magnetic ﬁeld applied but the past history of the magnetization. If the medium
was previously saturated at –Ms, then when the magnetic ﬁeld H is reduced to zero, the remanent magnetization
will be –Mr; however, if it was previously saturated at +Ms, then the remanent magnetization would be +Mr.
