Instantaneous speed cameras measure the speed at a single point. These may either be a semi-permanent fixture or be established on a temporary basis. A variety of technologies can be used:
Radar speed guns use a microwave signal that is directed at a vehicle; the Doppler effect is used to derive its speed.
LIDAR speed guns utilize the time of flight of laser pulses to make a series of timestamped measurements of a vehicle's distance from the laser; the data is then used to calculate the vehicle's speed.
Sensors embedded in the roadway in pairs, for example electromagnetic induction or Piezo-electric strips a set distance apart.
Infra-red light sensors located perpendicular to the road, e.g. TIRTL
