The frequency-response curves shown in figures 3-17, 3-18, and 3-19 have a gain-bandwidth product
of 1,000,000. In figure 3-17, the gain is 100,000 and the bandwidth is 10 hertz. The gain-bandwidth
product is 100,000 times 10 (Hz), or 1,000,000. In figure 3-18, the gain has been reduced to 100 and the
bandwidth increases to 10 kilohertz. The gain-bandwidth product is 100 times 10,000 (Hz) which is also
equal to 1,000,000. In figure 3-19 the gain has been reduced to 10 and the bandwidth is 100 kilohertz. The
gain-bandwidth product is 10 times 100,000 (Hz), which is 1,000,000. If the gain were reduced to 1, the
bandwidth would be 1 megahertz (which is shown on the frequency-response curve as the unity-gain
point) and the gain-bandwidth product would still be 1,000,000.
