Accidental tape damage that causes tape failure is any damage that wouldnâ€™t normally occur under
ideal operating and handling conditions. It can be caused by either a human operator or the tape recorder
itself. Accidental tape damage caused by human operators can range from accidentally dropping a reel of
magnetic tape to improperly threading a magnetic tape recorder. Accidental tape damage caused by
recording equipment can occur if the recorder is poorly designed or if the tape transport mechanism is
adjusted improperly.
