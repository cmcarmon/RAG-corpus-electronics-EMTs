BIT is an acronym for the words binary digit. In binary signals, a bit is equivalent to a signal 
element. Because of the influence of computer and data processing upon our language, modulation rate is 
sometimes expressed in bits per second. When you understand all signal elements being transmitted are of 
equal length, then the modulation rate expressed in bits per second is the same as the modulation rate 
expressed in baud.
