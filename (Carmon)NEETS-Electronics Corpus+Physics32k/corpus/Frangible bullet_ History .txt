Injuries from lead bullet fragments ricocheting off metal targets at 20th-century amusement park shooting galleries encouraged development of frangible bullets in specialized .22 Short gallery loads including Peters Krumble Ball, Remington Spatter-Less, Western Kant-Splash, and Winchester Spatterpruf. The United States used frangible lead/Bakelite M22 bullets in aircraft .30 caliber machine guns for target practice at armored RP-63 manned target aircraft.
Frangible bullets offer improved safety for specialized combat simulation training involving firing at an array of multiple steel targets in various directions encountered while moving through a maze. Frangible bullets are also used in reduced ricochet, limited penetration (RRLP) loads intended to reduce risk to friendly forces and innocent persons during close quarters military or police actions in urban areas, aboard ships or aircraft, or in hazardous material environments like oil platforms and chemical or nuclear plants.
