The input and output lines are orthogonally crossed over in
the Marchand baluns, and two ports are electrically terminated
with either a short or open end that transforms either open or
short effects at the junction through two quarter-wavelength
line transformers. The modal conversion is thus achieved over
the junction together with a potential line-to-line impedance
transformation. Generally, the Marchand baluns are simple in
