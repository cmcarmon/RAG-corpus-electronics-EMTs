Control engineers often are referred to as mathematicians in
disguise. Indeed, a ﬁrm foundation in mathematics is essential
for success in the control arena. Many practicing control en-
gineers delve into the intricacies of one or more particular
ﬁelds of mathematics. Consequently, many of the sections in
this chapter on controls rely heavily on algebraic consider-
ations or have algebraic roots. This chapter purports to pro-
vide a lively introduction for such investigations by discussing
common algebraic topics that occur in control. Along the way,
examples of engineering applications are pointed out to the
interested reader.
