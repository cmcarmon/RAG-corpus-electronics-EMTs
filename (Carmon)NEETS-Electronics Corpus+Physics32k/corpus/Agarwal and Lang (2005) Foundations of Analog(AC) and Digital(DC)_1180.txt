Notice here that the gain of the BJT amplifier is independent of the operating point,
provided the BJT operates in the active region. For a given BJT device (that is, a fixed
value for β) the gain can be increased by increasing RL or decreasing RI.
Finally, substituting RI = 100 k, RL = 10 k, β = 100, we obtain
