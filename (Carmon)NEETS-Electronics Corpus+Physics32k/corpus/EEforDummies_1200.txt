The cornerstone of the LED flasher (as well as other projects in this chapter) 
is the 555 timer IC. You can use this versatile part in a variety of ways, as 
explained in Chapter 11. For this project, the 555 timer is configured as an 
astable multivibrator (which is a fancy way of saying it’s an oscillator) gen-
erating an ongoing series of on/off pulses at regular intervals, sort of like an 
electronic metronome. The output of the 555 timer IC, at pin 3, is what you 
use to switch on and off the LED current.
