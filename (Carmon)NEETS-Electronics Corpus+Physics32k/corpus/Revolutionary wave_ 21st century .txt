The colour revolutions were various related movements that developed in several societies in the former Soviet Union and the Balkans during the early 2000s.
The fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003, and the Arab Spring, which ended the Pan-Arabist revolutionary wave, saw mass protests and revolutions in the Arab world. The events began in late 2010 and devolved into the Arab Winter in 2014.
The Arab Winter is a violent mass reaction following the Arab Spring characterized by resurgent authoritarianism and Islamic extremism since 2014.
