. Context switch in the OS: Sending or receiving a packet
involves context switch in the OS, which takes a ﬁnite
time. Hence, there exists a theoretical maximum at which
a computer can transmit packets. For a 10 Mbps LAN,
this delay might seem insigniﬁcant; however, for gigabit
networks, this delay becomes quite signiﬁcant. Again,
reduction in this delay will require enhancing the device
drivers and increasing the operating speed of the com-
puter.
