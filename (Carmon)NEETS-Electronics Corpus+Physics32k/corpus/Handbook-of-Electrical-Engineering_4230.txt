Loss and System Temperature Estimation
Sources of 
 loss include ohmic and nonohmic (mismatch) loss in the antenna and other radio frequency
components, propagation effects, signal processing deviations from matched Ô¨Ålter operation, detection thresh-
olding,  and  search  losses.  Scan  loss  in  phased  array  radars  is  due  to  the  combined  effects  of  the  decrease  in
projected antenna area and element mismatch with increasing scan angle.
