a high rate. One way that the controller can get its data quickly
is for the middleware to duplicate the data and the sensor
methods in the memory that is local to the controller program.
The middleware can update the data at the speciÔ¨Åed rate by
putting this information into a memory location that is ac-
cessed by the subscribing object. Hence, the stabilizing con-
troller can call a method of a sensor object, and it is actually
calling the duplicate (also called the replicate or the cache
copy). Such a local method call is much faster than a remote
method call across the communication channel.
