13.1.12 A 100-kW, dc shunt generator, connected to a
220-V main, is belt-driven at 300 r/min, when
the belt suddenly breaks and the machine con-
tinues to run as a motor, taking 10 kW from the
mains. The armature winding resistance is 0.025
, and the shunt Ô¨Åeld winding resistance is 60 .
Determine the speed at which the machine runs
as a motor.
