In communication systems, messages—signals produced by sources—must be recast for transmission.
The block diagram has the message s (t) passing through a block labeled transmitter that produces the
signal x (t). In the case of a radio transmitter, it accepts an input audio signal and produces a signal that
physically is an electromagnetic wave radiated by an antenna and propagating as Maxwell’s equations predict.
In the case of a computer network, typed characters are encapsulated in packets, attached with a destination
address, and launched into the Internet. From the communication systems “big picture” perspective, the
same block diagram applies although the systems can be very diﬀerent. In any case, the transmitter should
not operate in such a way that the message s (t) cannot be recovered from x (t). In the mathematical sense,
the inverse system must exist, else the communication system cannot be considered reliable. (It is ridiculous
to transmit a signal in such a way that no one can recover the original. However, clever systems exist that
transmit signals so that only the “in crowd” can recover them. Such cryptographic systems underlie secret
communications.)
