NTDS uses three separate data transmission links to maintain tactical data communications between 
tactical units. Figure 5-12 illustrates these links. Each link is able to transfer data rapidly to other ships, 
aircraft, and shore facilities without the delay of human interface (link 14 receive is an exception to this). 
The data processing subsystem formats the messages for each of the data links. These messages are based 
on shipboard inputs (from displays, sensors, and other data links).
