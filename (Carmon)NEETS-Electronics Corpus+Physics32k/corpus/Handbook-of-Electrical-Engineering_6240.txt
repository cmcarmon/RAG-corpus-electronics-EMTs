Scanning Lines and Fields
The image pattern of electrical charges on a camera tube target or CCD, corresponding to the brightness levels
of a scene, are converted to a video signal in a sequential order of picture elements in the scanning process. At
the end of each horizontal line sweep, the video signal is blanked while the beam returns rapidly to the left side
of the scene to start scanning the next line. This process continues until the image has been scanned from top
to bottom to complete one Ô¨Åeld scan.
