Three demodulators are used in this receiver. They are the AM detector, product detector, and fm 
detector. The AM detector is used to demodulate AM signals. The product detector demodulates ssb, cw, 
and fsk signals, and the fm detector demodulates fm signals only. An output from the fm detector is 
provided to the FM OUT jack. This fm output may be used for recording or detailed analysis.
