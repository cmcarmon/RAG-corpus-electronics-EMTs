With literally hundreds of papers on FDTD methods and
applications published each year, it is clear that FDTD is one of
the most powerful and widely used numerical modeling ap-
proaches for electromagnetic wave interaction problems. With
expanding developer and user communities in an increasing
number of disciplines in science and engineering, FDTD tech-
nology is continually evolving in terms of its theoretical basis,
numerical
implementation, and technological applications,
which now span the spectral range from ELF to daylight.
