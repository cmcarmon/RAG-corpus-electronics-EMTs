Elastic collision – a collision during which no kinetic energy is lost
Electric current – the flow of electric charge through an object
Electrical resistance – a measure of the degree to which an object opposes the passage of electric current
Energy – a measure of being able to do mechanical work
Electromotive force – the amount of energy gained per unit charge that passes through a device in the opposite direction to the electric field existing across that device
Eddy currents – changing magnetic flux linked with metal plate produces induced current which flow in closed paths throughout the body of the metal
