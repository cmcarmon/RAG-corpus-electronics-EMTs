useful because it establishes information by charging and dis-
charging signal lines; the second type, consisting of short-
circuit and static power components, is waste and comes
from short-circuit and leakage currents that ï¬‚ow directly
from the power supply to ground. Figure 5.8 shows the relative
behavior of these power components with respect to the input
switching activity for an inverter. The following subsections
introduce the different power components and give their para-
metric equations. Much of this material can be found in
(Smith, 1997; Rabaey, 1996; Weste and Eshraghian, 1993;
Kang and Leblebici, 1999).
