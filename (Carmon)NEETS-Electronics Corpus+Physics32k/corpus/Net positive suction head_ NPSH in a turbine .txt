The calculation of NPSH in a reaction turbine is different to the calculation of NPSH in a pump, because the point at which cavitation will first occur is in a different place. In a reaction turbine, cavitation will first occur at the outlet of the impeller, at the entrance of the draft tube. Denoting the entrance of the draft tube by e, the NPSHA is defined in the same way as for pumps:






NPSH


A

(

)

−



p

v



ρ
g





{\displaystyle {\text{NPSH}}_{A}=\left({\frac {p_{e}}{\rho g}}+{\frac {V_{e}^{2}}{2g}}\right)-{\frac {p_{v}}{\rho g}}}

Applying Bernoulli's principle from the draft tube entrance e to the lower free surface 0, under the assumption that the kinetic energy at 0 is negligible, that the fluid is inviscid, and that the fluid density is constant:

f




{\displaystyle {\frac {p_{e}}{\rho g}}+{\frac {V_{e}^{2}}{2g}}+z_{e}={\frac {p_{0}}{\rho g}}+z_{0}+h_{f}}

Using the above application of Bernoulli to eliminate the velocity term and local pressure terms in the definition of NPSHA:

f




{\displaystyle {\text{NPSH}}_{A}={\frac {p_{0}}{\rho g}}-{\frac {p_{v}}{\rho g}}-(z_{e}-z_{0})+h_{f}}

Note that, in turbines minor losses (

f




{\displaystyle h_{f}}
) alleviate the effect of cavitation - opposite to what happens in pumps.
