wish to investigate the performance of the synchronization system to various data patterns or the robustness
of the synchronization system in the face of interference. The ability to measure the system response to one
parameter  while  a  wide  range  of  other  parameters  are  held  ﬁxed  and  the  ability  to  quickly  generate  a  wide
variety of environments are some of the more signiﬁcant advantages that simulation enjoys over more conven-
tional hardware and analytical models.
