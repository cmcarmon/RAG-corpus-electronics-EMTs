Digital building blocks (made up of transistor circuits) and computer systems have been
presented in Chapter 6. Digital circuits are almost always purchased as ready-made IC building
blocks. However, users of digital hardware must decide which technology is best suited for each
case because competing technologies known as logic families are available. Digital circuit design
is of course of great interest to engineers in the IC industry for designing and building digital
blocks. The users of digital technology will certainly beneÔ¨Åt from knowing what is inside the
blocks they use.
