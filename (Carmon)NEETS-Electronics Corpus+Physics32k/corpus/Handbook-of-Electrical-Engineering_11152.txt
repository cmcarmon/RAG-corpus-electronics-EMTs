In biomedical applications pressure is generally referenced to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, the pressure
in the chamber of the pressure transducer must be maintained at atmospheric pressure. This is done by means
of a vent in the chamber wall or a ﬁne bore, ﬂexible capillary tube that couples the chamber to the atmosphere.
This tube is usually included in the electrical cable connecting the pressure transducer to the external instru-
mentation such that the tube is open to the atmosphere at the cable connecter.
