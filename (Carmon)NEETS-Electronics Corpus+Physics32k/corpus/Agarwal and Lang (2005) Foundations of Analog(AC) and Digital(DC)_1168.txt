s o u r c e f o l l o w e r A useful circuit we have seen
before3 is the source follower shown in Figure 8.38. The source follower in the figure
is shown driving an external load resistor RL. Assume that the total input voltage vI
includes the appropriate DC bias voltage to meet the saturation discipline. The small-
signal equivalent circuit for the source follower is shown in Figure 8.39. Let us analyze
this circuit by computing its small-signal gain.
