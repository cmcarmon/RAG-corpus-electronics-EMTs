Any of the organizational levels may additionally have planning functions that precede the operational time
scales by up to months or years. The planning side includes events such as logistics, maintainence, training,
and exercises, all of which contribute toward becoming a more capable combatant. Figure 103.3 portrays the
planning and the operational or execution phases as well as portraying the adaptive control loop approach to
C3. The lighter shaded feedback path is employed when it is required to compare status with the current plan.
It is also available for adjustment when plans or objectives are modiﬁed. The execution phases are represented
by the Stimulus-Hypothesis-Options-Response (SHOR) Paradigm suggested by Wohl [1981]. The control the-
oretic implications are apparent in the ﬁgure; the Stimulus-Hypothesis is a representation of situation assess-
ment with its implicit uncertainty. Quickness and accuracy with which a military command organization can
transverse the execution loop is a general measure of performance (MOP). Qualitatively it is generally accepted
that  the  side  with  the  best  ability  to  transverse  the  SHOR  execution  loop  will  have  a  signiﬁcant  military
advantage. In this light, attributes of the execution loop become a measure of effectiveness (MOE) of the C3
system in terms of operational outcomes. Rules of Engagement (ROE) impact tempo by reducing uncertainty
or options available to the decisionmaker. Some scenarios develop with such quickness that the C3 system must
react nearly reﬂexively (e.g., without consideration of possible options). One class of rules is made known to
all the participants; if a particular manuever is observed, then a speciﬁed response will result.
