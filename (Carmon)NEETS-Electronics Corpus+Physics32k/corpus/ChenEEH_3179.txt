Owing to the weak nature of the electrostatic bonds, organic
materials have a much lower surface free energy; hence, they
are not easily wetted by water. In fact, on new composite
insulators, water usually forms small individual beads instead
of a continuous Ô¨Ålm. This property of water repellency is called
hydrophobicity. This resistance to water wetting is desirable
