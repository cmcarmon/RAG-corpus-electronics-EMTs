Coupling constants arise naturally in a quantum field theory. A special role is played in relativistic quantum theories by coupling constants that are dimensionless; i.e., are pure numbers. An example of a dimensionless constant is the fine-structure constant,

,


{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}\hbar c}},}

where



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the charge of an electron,




ε

0




{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}
is the permittivity of free space,



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck constant and



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light. This constant is proportional to the square of the coupling strength of the charge of an electron to the electromagnetic field.
