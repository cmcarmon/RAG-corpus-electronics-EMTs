In the MMORPG City of Heroes, the quantum singularity is the "pet" power a gravity controller attains at level 32. The singularity takes the form of a human sized ball of light surrounded by waves of coloured energy. The Singularity is portable, and will follow its summoner around. The singularity uses a variety of gravity based attacks.
