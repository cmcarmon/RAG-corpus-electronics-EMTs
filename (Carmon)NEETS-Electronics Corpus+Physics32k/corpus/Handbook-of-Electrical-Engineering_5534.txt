The total capacitive range is divided into n operating intervals, where n is the number of capacitor banks in
the compensator. In the ﬁrst interval one capacitor bank is switched in, and at the same time the current in
the TCR bank is adjusted so that the resultant VAR output from capacitor and reactor matches the VAR demand.
In the ith interval the output is controllable in the range [(i – 1)VARmax/n] to (i VARmax/n) by switching in the
ith capacitor bank and using the TCR bank to absorb the surplus capacitive VARs. This scheme can be considered
as a conventional FC-TCR, where the rating of the reactor bank is kept relatively small (1/n times the maximum
VAR output) and the value of the capacitor bank is changed in discrete steps so as to keep the operation of the
reactor bank within its normal control range.
