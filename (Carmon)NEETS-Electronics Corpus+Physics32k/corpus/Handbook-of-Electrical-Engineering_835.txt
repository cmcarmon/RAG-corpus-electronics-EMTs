After the Second World War systems and control theory ﬂourished. The transfer function representation was
the most popular representation for systems. To determine the stability of a system we merely had to factor the
denominator  of  the  transfer  function  (12.9)  and  see  if  all  of  the  poles  were  in  the  left  half  of  the  complex
frequency plane. However, with manual techniques, factoring polynomials of large order is difﬁcult. So engi-
neers, being naturally lazy people, developed several ways to determine the stability of a system without factoring
the polynomials [Dorf, 1992]. First, we have the methods of Routh and Hurwitz, developed a century ago, that
looked  at  the  coefﬁcients  of  the  characteristic  polynomial.  These  methods  showed  whether  the  system  was
stable or not, but they did not show how close the system was to being stable.
