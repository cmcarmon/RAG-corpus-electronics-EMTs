As stated above, various mechanisms of EDSR operate in different crystals. The mechanism of its generically high efficiency is illustrated below as applied to electrons in direct-gap semiconductors of the InSb type. If spin-orbit splitting of energy levels

{\displaystyle e^{2}/\hbar c\approx 1/137}
is of the order of unity, and it is this product that plays the role of the effective coupling constant, cf. spin-orbit coupling. However, one should bear in mind that the above arguments based on effective mass approximation are not applicable to electrons localized in deep centers of the atomic scale. For them the electron paramagnetic resonance is usually the dominant mechanism.
