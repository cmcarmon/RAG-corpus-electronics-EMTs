In this form pressure is selected as the vertical coordinate and the horizontal coordinates are written for the Cartesian tangential plane (i.e. a plane tangent to some point on the surface of the Earth). This form does not take the curvature of the Earth into account, but is useful for visualizing some of the physical processes involved in formulating the equations due to its relative simplicity.
Note that the capital derivatives are the material derivatives.

When a statement of the conservation of water vapor substance is included, these six equations form the basis for any numerical weather prediction scheme.
