The purpose of the inverter is to make the output 
state the opposite of the input state. The two states as-
sociated with logic circuits are 1 and 0. A 1 state can 
also be referred to as a high, to indicate that the volt-
age is higher than in the 0 state. A 0 state can also be 
referred to as a low, to indicate that the voltage is 
lower than in the 1 state. If a 1, or high, is applied to 
the input of an inverter, a 0, or low appears on its out-
put. If a 0, or low, is applied to the input, a 1, or high, 
appears on its output.
