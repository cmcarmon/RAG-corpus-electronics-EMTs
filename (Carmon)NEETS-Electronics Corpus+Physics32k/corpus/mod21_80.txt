The two major advantages of using a digital multimeter are its ease of operation and accuracy. Most
digital multimeters can be ordered with an optional battery pack, which makes them just as portable as an
analog multimeter. Another advantage is that their LED or LCD readouts are much easier to read than the
scale on an analog multimeter. Digital multimeters also are ideally suited for measuring sensitive devices
that might otherwise be damaged by the excessive current associated with analog multimeters â€”
maximum current flow through the component being tested is typically limited to less than 1 milliamp.
When measuring small values of resistances, remember to consider the resistance of your test leads. Most
digital multimeters cannot be zeroed in the way analog multimeters can. With digital multimeters, you
have to short the leads, read the lead resistance displayed, and then subtract the reading from subsequent
component measurements that you make.
