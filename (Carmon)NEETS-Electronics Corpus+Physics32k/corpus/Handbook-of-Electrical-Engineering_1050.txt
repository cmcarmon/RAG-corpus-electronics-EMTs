Since the expression on the right-hand side of Eq. (14.3) is a function of  e j wT, it is customary to express the
transform as F(e j wT) = F{sa(t)}. It will be shown later that if w is replaced with a normalized frequency w¢ =
w/T, so that –p < w¢ < p, then the right side of Eq. (14.3) becomes identical to the DT Fourier transform that
is deﬁned directly for the sequence s[n] = sa(nT).
