From the time of Archimedes through the Renaissance, mechanisms were viewed as constructed from simple machines, such as the lever, pulley, screw, wheel and axle, wedge, and inclined plane. Reuleaux focused on bodies, called links, and the connections between these bodies called kinematic pairs, or joints.
To use geometry to study the movement of a mechanism, its links are modeled as rigid bodies. This means that distances between points in a link are assumed to not change as the mechanism movesâ€”that is, the link does not flex. Thus, the relative movement between points in two connected links is considered to result from the kinematic pair that joins them.
Kinematic pairs, or joints, are considered to provide ideal constraints between two links, such as the constraint of a single point for pure rotation, or the constraint of a line for pure sliding, as well as pure rolling without slipping and point contact with slipping. A mechanism is modeled as an assembly of rigid links and kinematic pairs.
