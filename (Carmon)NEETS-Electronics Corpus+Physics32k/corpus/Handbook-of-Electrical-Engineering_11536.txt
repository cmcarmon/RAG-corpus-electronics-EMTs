The FDTD method solves Maxwellâ€™s differential equations at each cell edge at discrete time steps. Since no
matrix solution is involved, electrically large geometries can be analyzed. FDTD solutions for three dimensional
complex biological geometries involving millions of cells have become routine. FDTD may be used for both
open region calculations, such as a human body in free space, or closed regions, such as within a TEM cell.
Commercial FDTD software is available from several sources (CST, EMA, and Remcom), with some of these
also offering FDTD meshes for human heads and bodies. These commercial packages provide a graphical user
interface for viewing the FDTD mesh. Some provide interactive mesh editing (Remcom), while others allow
for import of objects from CAD programs (CST and EMA).
