The third-generation TMS320C30 (by TI) supports ﬁxed- as well as ﬂoating-point operations [Chassaing,
1992]. Features of this processor include 32-bit by 32-bit ﬂoating-point multiply operations in one instruction
cycle time of 60 ns. Since a number of instructions, such as load and store, multiply and add, can be performed
in parallel (in one cycle time), the TMS320C30 can execute a pair of parallel instructions in 30 ns, allowing
for 33.3 MIPS. The Harvard-based architecture of the ﬁxed-point processors was abandoned for one allowing
four  levels  of  pipelining  with  three  subsequent  instructions  being  consequently  fetched,  decoded,  and  read
while the current instruction is being executed. The TMS320C30 has 2 K words of on-chip memory and a total
of 16 million words of addressable memory spaces for program, data, and input/output. Specialized instructions
are available to make common DSP algorithms such as ﬁltering and spectral analysis execute fast and efﬁciently.
The architecture of the TMS320C30 was designed to take advantage of higher-level languages such as C and
ADA.  The  TMS320C31  and  TMS320C32,  recent  members  of  the  third-generation  ﬂoating-point  processors,
are available with a 40 ns instruction cycle time.
