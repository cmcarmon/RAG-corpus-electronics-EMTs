Body resistance is not a ﬁxed quantity. It varies from person to person and from time to
time. There’s even a body fat measurement technique based on a measurement of electrical
resistance between a person’s toes and ﬁngers. Differing percentages of body fat give provide
different resistances: just one variable affecting electrical resistance in the human body. In
order for the technique to work accurately, the person must regulate their ﬂuid intake for
several hours prior to the test, indicating that body hydration is another factor impacting the
body’s electrical resistance.
