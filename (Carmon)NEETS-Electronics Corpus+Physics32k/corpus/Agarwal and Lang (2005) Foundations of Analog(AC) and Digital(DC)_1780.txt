Since α < ω◦, the circuit is under-damped, and so we may use Equations 12.141 and
12.142 to determine the rising transient response. With the substitution of Equations
12.173 through 12.176 into Equations 12.141 and 12.142, the varying component of
the rising transient is found to be
˜vC(t) = 4.5(1 − 1.1 e
˜L(t) = 5.1 × 10
−3 e
