ikola  Tesla  was  born  of  Serbian  parents  in
the village of Smiljan, in what is now Yugo-
slavia.  He  showed  his  technical  brilliance
early, but felt that his native country offered him only
limited  opportunities.  In  1884  he  emigrated  to  the
United States and began working for Thomas Edison.
He soon struck out on his own, however, for Edison
had little use for Tesla’s bold new ideas — in partic-
ular, his brilliant solution to the problems of applying
alternating current in light and power systems. Tesla’s
polyphase  ac  system  was  brought  to  market  by
George  Westinghouse,  and  after  an  acrimonious
struggle with the Edison interests, which were wed-
ded to the use of direct current (dc), the Tesla system
became  the  standard  in  the  twentieth  century.  Tesla’s
other inventions included the synchronous ac motor,
devices for generating high voltage and high frequency
currents, and contributions to radio technology. Tesla
received the Edison Medal of the American Institute of
Electrical  Engineers  in  1916.  (Courtesy  of  the  IEEE
