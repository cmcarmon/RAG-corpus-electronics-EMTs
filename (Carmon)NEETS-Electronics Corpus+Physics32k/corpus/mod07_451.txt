views A and B of figure 4-20.) Consequently, when the pulsating voltage is first applied to the LC 
choke-input filter, the inductor (L1) produces a CEMF which opposes the constantly increasing input 
voltage. The net result is to effectively prevent the rapid charging of the filter capacitor (C1). Thus, 
instead of reaching the peak value of the input voltage, C1 only charges to the average value of the input 
voltage. After the input voltage reaches its peak and decreases sufficiently, the capacitor C1) attempts to 
discharge through the load resistance RL). C1 will only partially discharge, as indicated in view B of the 
figure, because of its relatively long discharge time constant. The larger the value of the filter capacitor, 
the better the filtering action. However, because of physical size, there is a practical limitation to the 
maximum value of the capacitor.
