We model forces as Euclidean vectors or members of





R


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
. Our first assumption is that the resultant of two forces is in fact another force, so that for any two forces




F

,

G

∈


R


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ,\mathbf {G} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
there is another force




F

⊕

G

∈


R


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \oplus \mathbf {G} \in \mathbb {R} ^{2}}
. We assume commutativity, as these are forces being applied concurrently, so the order shouldn't matter




F

⊕

G

=

G

⊕

F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \oplus \mathbf {G} =\mathbf {G} \oplus \mathbf {F} }
.
Consider the map
If



⊕


{\displaystyle \oplus }
is associative, then this map will be linear. Since it also sends





e


1




{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1}}
to





e


1




{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{1}}
and





e


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{2}}
to





e


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {e} _{2}}
, it must also be the identity map. Thus



⊕


{\displaystyle \oplus }
must be equivalent to the normal vector addition operator.
