In sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁelds the drift velocity is no longer proportional to the electric ﬁeld. Typical
velocity–ﬁeld dependencies for several semiconductors are shown in Fig. 22.5. In GaAs vd(%) dependence is not
monotonic, which results in negative differential conductivity. Physically, this effect is related to the transfer of
electrons from the conduction band to a secondary valley (see Fig. 22.3).
