CARRIER-CONTROLLED APPROACH and GROUND-CONTROLLED APPROACH radar
systems are essentially shipboard and land-based versions of the same type of radar. Shipboard CCA
radar systems are usually much more sophisticated systems than GCA systems. This is because of the
movements of the ship and the more complicated landing problems. Both systems, however, guide
aircraft to safe landing under conditions approaching zero visibility. By means of radar, aircraft are
detected and observed during the final approach and landing sequence. Guidance information is supplied
to the pilot in the form of verbal radio instructions, or to the automatic pilot (autopilot) in the form of
pulsed control signals.
