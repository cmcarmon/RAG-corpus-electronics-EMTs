The individual starts with their feet on the ground, heels together. The palms are then placed on the ground five hand lengths away from the toes, forming a diamond with the thumbs and the fingers. The body is bent at the hips to form a 90-degree angle between the torso and legs. The arms are bent at the elbow until the top of the head almost touches the ground between the hands. The arms are then straighted to return to the starting position. The back and legs should be kept as straight as possible throughout the exercise.
The difficulty of the exercise may be decreased by placing the hands on an elevated surface, while placing the feet on the elevated surface will cause the exercise to become more difficult.
