A helix, to use a more accurate term than spiral, is basically a circular curve that advances along the z-axis while rotating in the x-y plane. Helices are either right- or left-handed, curled fingers giving the direction of rotation and thumb giving the direction of advance. The two types are mirror images of each other, physically distinct and cannot be transformed into each other by any physical operation such as turning them over.
The threads on a right-handed screw are a right-handed helix. They are basically a long inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder such that turning the screw advances the screw back and forth along the z-axis. From the point of view of the external threads, turning the screw forces the screw up or down the inclined plane. If a screw is right-handed (most screws are) the rule is this: point your right thumb in the direction you want the screw to go and turn the screw in the direction of your curled right fingers.
