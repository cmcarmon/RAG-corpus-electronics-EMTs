If the supports of two fields are space-like separated, then the fields either commute or anticommute.
Cyclicity of a vacuum, and uniqueness of a vacuum are sometimes considered separately. Also, there is property of asymptotic completeness – that Hilbert state space is spanned by the asymptotic spaces

, appearing in the collision S matrix. The other important property of field theory is mass gap which is not required by the axioms – that energy-momentum spectrum has a gap between zero and some positive number.
