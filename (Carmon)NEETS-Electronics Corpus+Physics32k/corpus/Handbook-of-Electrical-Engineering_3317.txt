Vacuum Photodiodes
A vacuum photodiode comprises a negatively biased photocathode and a positive anode in a vacuum envelope.
Light falling on the cathode causes electrons to be emitted, and these electrons are collected at the anode. Not
all  photons  cause  photoelectrons  to  be  emitted,  and  quantum  efﬁciencies,  h,  typically  run  0.5–20%.  These
devices are not very sensitive; however, they have very good linearity of current to incident light power, P. They
are also high-speed devices, with rise time being limited by the transit time ﬂuctuations of electrons arriving
at the anode. The photocurrent is given by
