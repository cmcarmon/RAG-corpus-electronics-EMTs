Noise: A  signal  N(t)  whose  value  at  any  time  t  is  randomly  selected  by  events  beyond  our  control. At  any
time instant t, N(t) is a random variable Nt with a probability distribution that determines the relative
frequencies  at  which  Nt  assumes  values.  The  statistics  of  the  family  of  random  variables  {Nt}  may  be
constant (stationary) over time (the usual case) or may vary.
