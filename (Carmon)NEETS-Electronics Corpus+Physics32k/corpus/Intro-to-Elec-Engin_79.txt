A problem related to power transfer is that of source loading. Figure 1.2.4(a) illustrates a
practical voltage source (i.e., an ideal voltage source along with a series internal source resistance)
connected to a load resistance; Figure 1.2.4(b) shows a practical current source (i.e., an ideal
current source along with a parallel or shunt internal source resistance) connected to a load
resistance. It follows from Figure 1.2.4(a) that
