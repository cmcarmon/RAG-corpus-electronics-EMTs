Figure 4.14(D) shows the image recovered from the blurred
and quantized image. In the implementation of the Wiener
ﬁlter, it was supposed that the ensemble of the input could be
modeled by a ﬁrst-order Gauss-Markov process [AR(1)] with
correlation coefﬁcient equal to 0.95. Since the image has a
dynamic range of 256 and was quantized with quantization
interval 1, the noise was supposed to be white and uniform
with density 1/12 (see equation 4.15). We note that the recov-
ery is far better than the one obtained with the pseudo-inverse
ﬁlter.
