can be applied to both the varactor and the capacitor. In this case, the size of the insulation gap of the 
varactor, or depletion region, is substituted for the distance between the plates of the capacitor. By 
varying the reverse-bias voltage applied to the varactor, the width of the "gap" may be varied. An increase 
in reverse bias increases the width of the gap (d) which reduces the capacitance (C) of the PN junction. 
Therefore, the capacitance of the varactor is inversely proportional to the applied reverse bias.
