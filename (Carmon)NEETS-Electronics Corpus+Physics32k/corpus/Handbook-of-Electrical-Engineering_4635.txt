The radiation impedance thus has a mass-like reactance with an equivalent “radiation mass” of (8/3)r0a3 and
a small resistive component proportional to w2 responsible for the radiated power. A transducer will thus have
a lower resonant frequency when operated underwater than when operated in air or vacuum. The total radiated
power of the piston transducer is given by
