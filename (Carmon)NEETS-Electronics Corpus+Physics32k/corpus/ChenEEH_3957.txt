digital signal processor, or even dedicated hardware. The tasks
of implementation involve algorithm design, code generation
(programming), and architecture synthesis. With the same
integrated circuit technology, a specialized hardware platform
may offer better performance than general-purpose hardware
by eliminating redundant operations and components. How-
ever, the design and manufacturing cost will be higher.
