In quantum mechanics, a singlet state usually refers to a system in which all electrons are paired. The term singlet originally meant a linked set of particles whose net angular momentum is zero, that is, whose overall spin quantum number

0


{\displaystyle s=0}
. As a result, there is only one spectral line of a singlet state. In contrast, a doublet state contains one unpaired electron and shows splitting of spectral lines into a doublet; and a triplet state has two unpaired electrons and shows threefold splitting of spectral lines.
