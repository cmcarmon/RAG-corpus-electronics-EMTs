The next line (3rd for the SPARC) does a comparison between 48 (or 47) and the character. Compare
is an instruction which subtracts one operand from the other, but instead of putting the results some-
where, it stores only the facts on whether the operation delivered a negative number or zero or resulted
in either an overﬂow or a carry. These are stored in ﬂags, single bits associated with the arithmetic unit.
The  bits  can  contain  only  one  result  at  a  time.  The  68000  and VAX  must  test  immediately  after  the
comparison  or  they  will  lose  the  bits.  The  SPARC  changes  the  bits  only  when  the  instruction  says  so
(the CC on the instruction — “change condition codes”). Thus, the subtraction can be remote from the
test-and-branch.
