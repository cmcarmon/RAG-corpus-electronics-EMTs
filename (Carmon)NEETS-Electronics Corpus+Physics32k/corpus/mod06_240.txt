CLASS C amplifiers are biased below cutoff, so that the tube will conduct for less than half of the
input signal cycle duration. View D of figure 1-27 depicts a Class C amplifier. Notice that the tube is
biased one-half volt below cutoff. The tube will only conduct on that part of the positive alternation that is
above +.5 volts. Therefore, the tube conducts for less than one-half cycle of the input. Again, this class
can be applied only where severe distortion can be tolerated.
