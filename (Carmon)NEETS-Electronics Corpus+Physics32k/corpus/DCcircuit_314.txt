Voltage by its very nature is a manifestation of potential energy. In the ﬁrst chapter I
even used elevated liquid as an analogy for the potential energy of voltage, having the capacity
(potential) to produce current (ﬂow), but not necessarily realizing that potential until a suitable
path for ﬂow has been established, and resistance to ﬂow is overcome. A pair of wires with
high voltage between them do not look or sound dangerous even though they harbor enough
potential energy between them to push deadly amounts of current through your body. Even
though that voltage isn’t presently doing anything, it has the potential to, and that potential
must be neutralized before it is safe to physically contact those wires.
