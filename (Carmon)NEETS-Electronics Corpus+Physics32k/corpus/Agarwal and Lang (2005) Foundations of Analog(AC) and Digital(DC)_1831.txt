Electrical networks are used to model physical systems governed
by linear differential equations. The most important problems that arise in such modeling
concern the interplay of accuracy and simplicity. It is usually very important to know
when certain effects can safely be ignored in order to simplify the model and subsequent
analysis. Such knowledge can be obtained by understanding the consequences of making
the simplifying assumptions.
