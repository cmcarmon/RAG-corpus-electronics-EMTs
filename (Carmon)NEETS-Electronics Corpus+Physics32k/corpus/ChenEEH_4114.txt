When we add additional levels to a baseband system, we are
reducing the distance between detection levels in the receiver
output. Thus, the error rate of a multilevel baseband system
can be determined by calculating the appropriate reduction in
the error distance. If the maximum amplitude is V, the error
distance de between equally spaced levels at the detector is as
follows:
