4 The input of an OTA-C ﬁlter is normally a parasitic capacitor ( 0:05 pF)
of a CMOS transistor. Thus, even at 100 MHz, the input impedance is still
larger than 30 kV. Furthermore, as the topology of the ﬁrst- and second-order
circuits in Figure 4.17 indicates, these input capacitors can be absorbed in the
circuit capacitors of the previous ﬁlter section.
