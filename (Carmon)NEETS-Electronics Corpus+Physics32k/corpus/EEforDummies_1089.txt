Relocating your circuit to a perfboard
Perfboards are circuit boards with predrilled holes arranged in grids so 
they can be used for prototyping. Most perfboards contain copper pads and 
traces. You can find a variety of single‐ and double‐sided perfboards at your 
local or online electronics supplier. Figure 15-8 shows a small sampling of 
perfboards. Other shapes and sizes are readily available, including round 
preprinted boards with different diameters and bare perfboards with no 
copper connections.
