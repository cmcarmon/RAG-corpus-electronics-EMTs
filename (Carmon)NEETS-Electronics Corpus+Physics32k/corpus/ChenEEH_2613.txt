The isolator is a two-port device with a very low insertion loss
(e.g., less than 0.5 dB) in one direction (forward) and very high
insertion loss (e.g., greater than 20 dB) in the other (reverse)
direction. The forward and reverse transmission losses depend
on the choice of ferrite materials and design topology as well as
operating frequency. Isolators are used to provide protection
from high-power reï¬‚ection and to stabilize signal sources or
power sensitive devices from frequency shifts caused by vari-
ations in load impedance. Isolators are also important devices
for eliminating unwanted interactions between components.
An ideal isolator is shown in Figure 7.42 with matched ports
and lossless transmission from port 1 to port 2. The corre-
sponding S-matrix is as follows:
