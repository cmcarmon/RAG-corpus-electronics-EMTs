One of the fundamental laws of physics is that energy cannot be created or 
destroyed; it can only change form. You witness this law in action with the 
simple battery‐driven LED circuit: Chemical energy is converted to electrical 
energy, which is converted to heat and light energy, which — well, you get 
the idea.
