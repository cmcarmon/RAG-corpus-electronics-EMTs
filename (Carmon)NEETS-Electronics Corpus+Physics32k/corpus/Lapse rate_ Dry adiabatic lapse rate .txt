Thermodynamics defines an adiabatic process as:




P

V
=

{\displaystyle PdV=-VdP/\gamma }

the first law of thermodynamics can be written as

{\displaystyle mc_{v}dT-Vdp/\gamma =0}

Also, since

{\displaystyle \alpha =V/m}
and

{\displaystyle \gamma =c_{p}/c_{v}}
, we can show that:

{\displaystyle c_{p}dT-\alpha dP=0}

where




c

p




{\displaystyle c_{p}}
is the specific heat at constant pressure and



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the specific volume.
Assuming an atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium:

g

{\displaystyle dP=-\rho gdz}

where g is the standard gravity and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density. Combining these two equations to eliminate the pressure, one arrives at the result for the dry adiabatic lapse rate (DALR),
