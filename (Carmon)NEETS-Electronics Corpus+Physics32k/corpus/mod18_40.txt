The term RADAR is common in todayâ€™s everyday language. You probably use it yourself when
referring to a method of recording the speed of a moving object. The term Radar is an acronym made up
of the words radio detection and ranging. The term is used to refer to electronic equipment that detect the
presence, direction, height, and distance of objects by using reflected electromagnetic energy.
Electromagnetic energy of the frequency used for radar is unaffected by darkness and also penetrates
weather to some degree, depending on frequency. It permits radar systems to determine the positions of
ships, planes, and land masses that are invisible to the naked eye because of distance, darkness, or
weather.
