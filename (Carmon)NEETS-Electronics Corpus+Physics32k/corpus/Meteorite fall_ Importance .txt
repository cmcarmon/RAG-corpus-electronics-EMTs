Observed meteorite falls are interesting for several reasons.
Material from observed falls has not been subjected to terrestrial weathering, making the find a better candidate for scientific study. Historically, observed falls were the most compelling evidence supporting the extraterrestrial origin of meteorites. Furthermore, observed fall discoveries are a better representative sample of the types of meteorites which fall to Earth. For example, iron meteorites take much longer to weather and are easier to identify as unusual objects, as compared to other types. This may explain the increased proportion of iron meteorites among finds (6.7%), over that among observed falls (4.4%). There is also detailed statistics on falls such as based on meteorite classification.
As of early 2018, the Meteoritical Bulletin Database has 1,161 confirmed falls with statistics for the previous decades in the table to the right.
Specifically, confirmed falls were eight for 2015, eleven for 2016, and four so far for 2017.
