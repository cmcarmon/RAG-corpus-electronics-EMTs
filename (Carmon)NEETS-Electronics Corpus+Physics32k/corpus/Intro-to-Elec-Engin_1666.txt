where Qi = KiKpKm and K = KpKaKm, as deﬁned earlier. Since the integral term stands alone
without combining with the viscous-friction F term (as was the case with error-rate and output-rate
controls), its inﬂuence on system performance differs basically from the previous compensation
schemes. Also note that the order of the system is changed from second to third, because of the
integral-error compensation. The inclusion of the integral term implies that a third independent
energy-storing element is present. The position lag error, which exists with error-rate and output-
rate control, disappears with integral-error control. This is a characteristic of integral control
which greatly improves steady-state performance and system accuracy. However, it may make
the dynamic behavior more difﬁcult to cope with successfully.
