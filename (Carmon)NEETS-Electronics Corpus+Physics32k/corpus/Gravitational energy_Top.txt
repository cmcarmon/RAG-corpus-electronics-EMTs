Gravitational energy is the potential energy a body with mass has in relation to another massive object due to gravity. It is potential energy associated with the gravitational field. Gravitational energy is dependent on the masses of two bodies, their distance apart and the gravitational constant (G).
In everyday cases only one body is accelerating measurably, and its acceleration is constant (for example, dropping a ball on Earth). For such scenarios the Newtonian formula can – for the potential energy of the accelerating body with respect to the stationary – be reduced to:




E
=
m
g
h


{\displaystyle E=mgh}

where



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the gravitational potential energy,



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the object accelerating,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration of the object, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the distance between the bodies. Note that this formula treats the potential energy as a positive quantity.
