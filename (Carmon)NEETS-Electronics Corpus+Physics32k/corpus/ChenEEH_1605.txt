CBR has been applied to a variety of applications, including
diagnosis, classiÔ¨Åcation, interpretation, instruction, planning,
and scheduling. One example is Support Management Auto-
mated Reasoning Technology (SMART) of Compaq (Acorn
and Walden, 1992), which provides quality technical support
by using previous cases to resolve new ones instead of trying to
diagnose a new problem from scratch. Another system, CARES
(Ong et al., 1997), employs CBR to predict the recurrence of
colorectal cancer.
