ISA expansion slots have existed in PCs for years. Most of
the interfaces depending on them such as parallel ports and
serial ports, however, have been integrated into motherboards.
Moreover, in the PC 99 System Design Guide advocated by
Intel and Microsoft, ISA slots have been removed because of
their conÔ¨Åguration issues.
