The meter is mechanically damped by means of aluminum vanes that move in enclosed air
chambers. Although very accurate, electrodynamometer-type meters do not have the sensitivity of the
Dâ€™Arsonval-type meter movement. For this reason, you will not find them used outside of the laboratory
environment to a large extent.
