A block diagram of a two-phase clock system is shown in figure 3-22, view A. The astable
multivibrator provides the basic timing for the circuit, while the one-shot multivibrators are used to shape
the pulses. Outputs Q and Q  are input to one-shot multivibrators 1 and 2, respectively. The resulting
outputs are in phase with the inputs, but the duration of the pulse is greatly reduced as shown in view B.
