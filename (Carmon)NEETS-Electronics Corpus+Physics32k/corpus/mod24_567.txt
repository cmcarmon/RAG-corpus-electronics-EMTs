OTDRs can also measure the return loss of a point defect. However, not all OTDRs are configured to
make the measurement. To measure the return loss of a point defect, the cursors are placed in the same
places as for measuring the loss of the point defect. The return loss of the point defect is displayed when
the return loss option is selected on the OTDR. The steps for selecting the return loss option depend upon
the OTDR being used.
