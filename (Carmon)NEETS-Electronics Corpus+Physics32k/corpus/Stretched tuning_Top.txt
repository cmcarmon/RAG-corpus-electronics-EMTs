Stretched tuning is a detail of musical tuning, applied to wire-stringed musical instruments, older, non-digital electric pianos (such as the Fender Rhodes piano and Wurlitzer electric piano), and some sample-based synthesizers based on these instruments, to accommodate the natural inharmonicity of their vibrating elements. In stretched tuning, two notes an octave apart, whose fundamental frequencies theoretically have an exact 2:1 ratio, are tuned slightly farther apart (a stretched octave). "For a stretched tuning the octave is greater than a factor of 2; for a compressed tuning the octave is smaller than a factor of 2."
Melodic stretch refers to tunings with fundamentals stretched relative to each other, while harmonic stretch refers to tunings with harmonics stretched relative to fundamentals which are not stretched. For example, the piano features both stretched harmonics and, to accommodate those, stretched fundamentals.
