To  increase  your  engineering  career  opportunities  after  graduation,
develop  a  strong  fundamental  understanding  in  a  broad  set  of  engineer-
ing  areas.  When  possible,  this  might  best  be  accomplished  by  working
toward  a  graduate  degree  immediately  upon  receiving  your  undergradu-
ate degree.
