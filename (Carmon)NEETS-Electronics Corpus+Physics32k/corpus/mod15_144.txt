The CT output voltage discussed throughout this section is commonly referred to as an ERROR 
SIGNAL. This is because the voltage represents the amount and direction that the CX and CT rotors are 
out of correspondence. It is this error signal that eventually is used in moving the load in a typical servo 
system.
