Drowsiness  and  sleep  affect  the  normal  EEG  profoundly.
Figure 113.21 illustrates the typical changes that occur as a subject
goes to sleep. With drowsiness, the higher-frequency activity which
is  associated  with  alertness  or  excitement  and  the  alpha  rhythm
that dominates the waking record in the relaxed state are replaced
by a characteristic cyclic sequence of changes which constitute the
focus of a new specialty devoted to sleep physiology, in which the
EEG is used to identify different stages of sleep.
