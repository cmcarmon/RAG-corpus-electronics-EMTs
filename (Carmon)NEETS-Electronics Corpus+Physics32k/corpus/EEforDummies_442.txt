Assuming the capacitor was discharged to begin with, the initial voltage 
across the capacitor, Vc, is zero. When you close the switch, current starts to 
flow and charges start to build up on the capacitor plates. Ohm’s Law (refer 
to Chapter 6) tells you that the charging current, I, is determined by the volt-
age across the resistor, Vr, and the value of the resistor, R, as follows:
