As of 2009, the search for various schemes to achieve higher area ratios for rocket nozzles remains an active field of research and patenting. Generally, modern application of these designs can be divided into "air-to-vacuum" engines, which start their work at sea level and finish it at vacuum conditions, and "vacuum" engines, which perform all their operations in a vacuum.
