Planning and Research
Energy research worldwide is assuming top priority, in particular because of economic, en-
vironmental, and resource constraints. DOE (Department of Energy) was established in the
United States in 1977. A major private utility sponsored energy research organization, EPRI
(Electric Power Research Institute) in Palo Alto, California, has been in existence since 1972.
In addition, large utility companies, such as AEP (American Electric Power), have their own
research programs.
