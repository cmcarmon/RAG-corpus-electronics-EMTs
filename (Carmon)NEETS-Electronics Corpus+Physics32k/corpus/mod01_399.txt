The routine maintenance of a battery is very simple. Terminals should be checked periodically for 
cleanliness and good electrical connection. The battery case should be inspected for cleanliness and 
evidence of damage. The level of electrolyte should be checked and if the electrolyte is low, distilled 
water should be added to bring the electrolyte to the proper level. Maintenance procedures for batteries 
are normally determined by higher authority and each command will have detailed procedures for battery 
care and maintenance.
