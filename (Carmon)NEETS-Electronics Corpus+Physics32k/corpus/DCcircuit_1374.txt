Again, the amount of voltage across a perfect inductor is directly proportional to the rate
of current change through it. The only difference between the effects of a decreasing current
and an increasing current is the polarity of the induced voltage. For the same rate of current
change over time, either increasing or decreasing, the voltage magnitude (volts) will be the
same. For example, a di/dt of -2 amps per second will produce the same amount of induced
voltage drop across an inductor as a di/dt of +2 amps per second, just in the opposite polarity.
If current through an inductor is forced to change very rapidly, very high voltages will be
