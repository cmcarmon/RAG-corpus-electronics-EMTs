You may also hear the terms potential difference, voltage potential, potential 
drop, or voltage drop used to describe voltage. The word potential refers to 
the possibility that a current may flow if you complete the circuit, and the 
words drop and difference both refer to the difference in charge that creates 
the voltage. You read more about this in ChapterÂ 3.
