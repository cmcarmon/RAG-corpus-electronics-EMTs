The MAGNETRON is a DIODE OSCILLATOR capable of delivering microwave energy at very 
high power levels. Three fields exist within a magnetron that influence operation: (1) the DC ELECTRIC 
FIELD between the anode and cathode; (2) the AC ELECTRIC FIELD produced by the oscillating 
resonant cavities and on the same plane as the dc field; and (3) the MAGNETIC FIELD produced by the 
permanent magnet which is perpendicular to the dc electric field.
