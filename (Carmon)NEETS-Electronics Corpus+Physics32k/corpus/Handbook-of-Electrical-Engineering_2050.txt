resulting in the simple update equation $hk+1 = $hk + aekxk, where a (or m) control the rate of change. In practice,
whenever  the  far-end  signal  x(t)  is  low  in  power,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  freeze  the  canceller  by  setting  a  =  0.
Sophisticated logic is needed to detect double talk. When it occurs, then also set a = 0. It can be shown that
the spread of the eigenvalues of the autocorrelation matrix of x(t) determines the convergence rate, where the
slowest-converging eigenmode corresponds to the smallest eigenvalue. Since the eigenvalues themselves scale
with the power of the predominant spectral components in x(t), setting a  = 2m/(xÂ¢x)  will make the convergence
rate independent of the far-end power. This is the normalized LMS method. Even then, however, all eigenmodes
will converge at the same rate only if x(t) is white noise. Therefore, pre-whitening the far-end signal will help
in speeding up convergence.
