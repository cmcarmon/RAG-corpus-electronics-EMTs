Inductance is a result of the physical makeup of a coil - number of turns, core, type of winding, etc. 
Inductance governs reactance at a given frequency. Resistance is inherent in the length, size, and material 
of the wire. Therefore, the Q of a coil is mostly dependent on physical characteristics.
