CAPACITORS IN A DC CIRCUITâ€”When a capacitor is connected to the terminals of a battery,
each plate of the capacitor becomes charged. The plate connected to the positive terminal loses electrons.
Because this plate has a lack of electrons, it assumes a positive charge. The plate connected to the negative
terminal gains electrons. Because the plate has an excess of electrons, it assumes a negative charge. This
process continues until the charge across the plates equals the applied voltage. At this point current ceases to
flow in the circuit. As long as nothing changes in the circuit, the capacitor will hold its charge and there will
be no current in any part of the circuit. If the leads of the capacitor are now shorted together, current again
