Following the FAA guidelines of Drop Test Approved Areas, The First School of Modern SkyFlying developed and documented the Atmosphere Dolphin FreeFly License Program, and set a standard for training and testing freeflyers worldwide.
The Atmosphere Dolphin FreeFly License Program utilises a measuring stick in the form of an independent reference (known as a Space Ball) to give a consistent worldwide standard for speed (155 mph) and direction (straight down). High speed precision athletes are required to perform predetermined aerobatic maneuvers around at first one, then two Space Balls to be awarded Atmosphere Dolphin FreeFly Licenses A to D.
To compete in the one-on-one rounds of the Space Games participants need to have a minimum of Atmosphere Dolphin License A, and to compete in the PRO rounds of the Space Games, participants need to have a minimum of Atmosphere Dolphin License B.
