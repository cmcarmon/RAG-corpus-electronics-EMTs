This format is more complex. It takes a serial input stream of data pulses, breaks them up, and
records them on more than one recorder track. When the tape is reproduced, the recorder recombines the
broken-apart data into its original form. Figure 7-1C shows how this looks. The serial-parallel format is
usually used in instrumentation recording when the input data rate is high.
