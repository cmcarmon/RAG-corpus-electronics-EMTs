The great advantage of computers over typewriters is in correcting errors. In the past, correcting a 
document with a typewriter has meant typing it all over again. Since computers allow the movement of 
information from one part of memory to another, it is possible to make many changes on a document, and 
print the result. If the document is still not correct, only the changes need to be entered. The use of 
computers in this particular way came to be known as word processing.
