In Eq. (2) the sum of 4 front element number call static pressure,the sum of last 2 element number call velocity pressure look carefully on the Fig 2.2 and the detail equation.
Ht theory head pressure  ; g = between 9.78 and 9.82 m/s2 depending on latitude, conventional standard value of exactly 9.80665 m/s2 barycentric gravitational acceleration
u2=r2.ω the peripheral circumferential velocity vector
u1=r1.ω the inlet circumferential velocity vector
ω=2π.n angular velocity
w1 inlet relative velocity vector
w2 outlet relative velocity vector
c1 inlet absolute velocity vector
c2 outlet absolute velocity vector
