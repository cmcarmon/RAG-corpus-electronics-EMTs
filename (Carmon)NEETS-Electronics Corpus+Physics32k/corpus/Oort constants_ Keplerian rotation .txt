The second illuminating example is to assume that the orbits in the local neighborhood follow a Keplerian orbit, as shown by the blue line in Figure 3. The orbital motion in a Keplerian orbit is described by,




v
=




G
M

r





{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {GM}{r}}}}

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the Gravitational Constant, and



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass enclosed within radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
. The derivative of the velocity with respect to the radius is,







d

v

{\displaystyle {\frac {dv}{dr}}=-{\frac {1}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {GM}{R^{3}}}}=-{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {v}{r}}}

The Oort constants can then be written as follows,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&A={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}+{\frac {v}{2r}}{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)={\frac {3V_{0}}{4R_{0}}}\\&B=-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {V_{0}}{R_{0}}}-{\frac {v}{2r}}{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)=-{\frac {1V_{0}}{4R_{0}}}\\\end{aligned}}}

For values of Solar velocity,

=

{\displaystyle V_{0}=218}
km/s, and radius to the Galactic center,




R

=

{\displaystyle R_{0}=8}
kpc, the Oort's constants are



A
=
20


{\displaystyle A=20}
km s−1 kpc−1, and



B
=
−
7


{\displaystyle B=-7}
km s−1 kpc−1. However, the observed values are



A
=
14


{\displaystyle A=14}
km s−1 kpc−1 and



B
=
−
12


{\displaystyle B=-12}
km s−1 kpc−1. Thus, Keplerian rotation is not the best description the Milky Way rotation. Furthermore, although this example does not describe the local rotation, it can be thought of as the limiting case that describes the minimum velocity an object can have in a stable orbit.
