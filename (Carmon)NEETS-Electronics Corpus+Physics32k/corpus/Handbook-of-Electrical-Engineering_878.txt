The most widely known and used circuit simulation program is SPICE (simulation program with integrated
circuit emphasis). This program was Ô¨Årst written at the University of California at Berkeley by Laurence Nagel
in 1975. Research in the area of circuit simulation is ongoing at many universities and industrial sites. Com-
mercial versions of SPICE or related programs are available on a wide variety of computing platforms, from
small personal computers to large mainframes. A list of some commercial simulator vendors can be found in
the Appendix.
