In discrete scheduling, parameters of the gain-scheduled
controller are switched when the parameter trajectory evolves
out of a predeÔ¨Åned subset of the parameter set, Qi  Q. This is
true, for instance, when the distance between the current
operating condition and the design point associated with the
current controller parameters exceeds a design threshold.
Expanding on the preceding example, a simple discrete sched-
uling law is given by:
