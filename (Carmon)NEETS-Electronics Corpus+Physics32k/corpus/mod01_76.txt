This principle is used in the fluorescent light where ultraviolet light photons, which are not visible to
the human eye, bombard a phosphor coating on the inside of a glass tube. The phosphor electrons, in
returning to their normal orbits, emit photons of light that are visible. By using the proper chemicals for
the phosphor coating, any color of light may be obtained, including white. This same principle is also
used in lighting up the screen of a television picture tube.
