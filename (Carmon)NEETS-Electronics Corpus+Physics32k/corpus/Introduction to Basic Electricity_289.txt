A	reward	of	being	skilled	in	circuitry	is	the	opportunity	to	venture	into	other
engineering	fields	such	as	robotics	engineering	and	computer	engineering.	Your
knowledge	of	how	a	circuit	operates?	You	can	look	at	it	from	a	brand	new
perspective;	you	donâ€™t	have	to	be	simply	in	the	industry	of	circuit	engineering	or
electronics	engineering.	Apart	from	its	offer	of	a	more	bountiful	career;	you	can
employ	it	to	create	a	project	(or	a	batch	of	projects)	that	you	can	be	proud	of.	With
the	mastery	of	the	basic	circuitry	lessons,	delving	into	related	fields	becomes
easier	and	more	exciting.
With	your	interest	in	circuitry,	you	may	seek	for	other	career	positions;	usually,	the
employers	of	robotics	engineers	and	computer	engineers	welcome	circuit
engineers	into	their	workforce	due	to	trainability,	familiarity	with	circuits,	and
good	background	in	electronics.	It	may	take	another	set	of	years	of	studying,	along
with	new	skills	to	learn,	but	you	can	definitely	go	higher;	it	takes	commitment
from	your	end,	too.
