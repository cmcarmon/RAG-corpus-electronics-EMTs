where pno Â¼ n2
i =Nd. The electron lifetime, tnl, in p-type silicon
and the hole lifetime, tpl,
in n-type silicon decrease with
increasing doping. At low doping levels, this decrease may be
explained by higher trap concentrations in the doped semicon-
ductor. We can crudely estimate electron and hole lifetimes in
Si as follows:
