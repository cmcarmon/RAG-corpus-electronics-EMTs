The logic comparator, as shown in figure 2-25, is designed to detect faulty, in-circuit-DIP ICs by
comparing them with ICs that are known to be good (reference ICs). The reference IC is mounted on a
small printed-circuit board and inserted into the logic comparator. You then attach the logic comparator to
the IC under test by a test lead, which is connected to a spring-loaded device similar in appearance to a
logic clip. The logic comparator is designed to detect differences in logic states of the reference IC and
the IC being tested. If any difference in logic states does exist on any pin, an LED corresponding to the
pin in question will be lit on the logic comparator. The logic comparator is powered by the IC under test.
