On Earth, the analemma appears as a figure-eight, but on other Solar System bodies, it may be very different due to the interplay between the three parameters determining the analemma: axial tilt of each body, eccentricity of the body's elliptic orbit, and position of either apses or equinoxes. Thus, if either of these variables (like eccentricity) always dominates the other (as is the case on Mars), the analemma will resemble a teardrop. If either of the variables (like eccentricity) is significant, and the other is practically zero (as is the case on Jupiter, with only a 3° tilt), the figure will be something much closer to an ellipse. If both are important enough, that sometimes eccentricity or axial tilt dominates, a figure-eight results.

In the following list, day and year refer to the synodic day and sidereal year of the particular body:
Mercury: Because orbital resonance makes the day exactly two years long, the method of plotting the Sun's position at the same time each day would yield only a single point. However, the equation of time can still be calculated for any time of the year, so an analemma can be graphed with this information. The resulting curve is a nearly straight east–west line.
Venus: There are slightly less than two days per year, so it would take several years to accumulate a complete analemma by the usual method. The resulting curve is an ellipse.
Mars: Teardrop.
Jupiter: Ellipse.
Saturn: Technically a figure-eight, but the northern loop is so small that it more closely resembles a teardrop.
Uranus: Figure-eight. (Uranus is tilted past sideways to an angle of 98 °degrees. Its orbit is about as elliptical as Jupiter's and more elliptical than Earth's.)
Neptune: Figure-eight.
