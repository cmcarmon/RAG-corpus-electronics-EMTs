The basic mechanism is reasonably straightforward; if we start with a conventional narrowband signal, say
a BPSK waveform having a spectrum as shown in Fig. 70.19(a), and then spread it so that its new spectrum is
as shown in Fig. 70.19(b), the peak amplitude of the spectrum after spreading has been reduced by an amount
on the order of the processing gain relative to what it was before spreading. Indeed, a sufÔ¨Åciently large processing
gain  will  result  in  the  spectrum  of  the  signal  after  spreading  falling  below  the  ambient  thermal  noise  level.
Thus, there is no easy way for an unintended listener to determine that a transmission is taking place.
