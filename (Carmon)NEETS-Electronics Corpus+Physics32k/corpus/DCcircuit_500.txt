With R2 at inﬁnite resistance and total resistance being the sum of all individual resistances
in a series circuit, the total current decreases to zero. With zero circuit current, there is no
electron ﬂow to produce voltage drops across R1 or R3. R2, on the other hand, will manifest the
full supply voltage across its terminals.
