Maximum	power	transfer,	a	concept	that	was	introduced	by	Moritz	von	Jacobi
sometime	in	the	1840s,	draws	light	on	the	idea	that	for	maximum	external	power
to	be	obtained,	an	internal	resistance	needs	to	be	in	place.	However,	the	transfer
can	only	be	flawless	if	the	original	resistance	is	equal	to	the	potential	power	that	an
internal	resistor	can	produce.
Consequently,	maximum	power	transfer	yields	results	that	point	out	power
transfer,	and	not	efficiency;	while	improved	efficiency	can	be	a	byproduct,	it	is	not
the	chief	purpose	of	maximum	power	transfer.	It	implies	that	although	higher
percentage	of	power	is	transferrable,	it	does	not	affect	the	magnitude	of	the	power
load	(i.e.	the	extent	that	it	can	affect	a	circuit).	In	the	event	that	the	internal
resistance	is	modified	to	accommodate	a	value	higher	than	the	value	of	the	original
resistance,	improved	efficiency	can	be	achieved.	
Moreover,	the	concept	of	maximum	power	transfer	was	initially	misunderstood;	a
subject	of	many	arguments	was	a	circuit’s	reduced	efficiency	with	the	occurrence
of	transfer.	Some	insisted	that	due	to	the	potential	power	that	is	lost	during	an
exchange,	a	circuit	may	fail	to	reach	100%	efficiency.	As	emphasis	of	this	group’s
angle,	take	for	example	the	case	of	a	motor	whose	power	is	transferred	from	a
battery;	power	in	this	situation	may	not	be	maximized,	and	it	will	only	be	realized
over	time	when	battery	power	has	been	fully	consumed.
