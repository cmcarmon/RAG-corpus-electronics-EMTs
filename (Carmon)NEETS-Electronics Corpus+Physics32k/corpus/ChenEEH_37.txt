ducing an unknown variable for the current through the voltage
source. Instead of applying KCL to each of the two nodes of the
voltage source element, KCL is applied to an imaginary node
consisting of both the nodes together. This imaginary node is
called a super node. In Figure 1.10, the super node is shown by a
dotted closed shape. KCL on this super node is given by:
