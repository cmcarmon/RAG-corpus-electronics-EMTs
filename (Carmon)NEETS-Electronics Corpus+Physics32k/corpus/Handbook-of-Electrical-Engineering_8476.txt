Implementation of Addition
Carry Look-Ahead Adder (CLA)
The ﬁrst signiﬁcant speed improvement in the implementation of a parallel adder was a carry-look-ahead adder
(CLA) developed by Weinberger and Smith [1958] in 1958. The CLA is one of the fastest schemes used for the
addition  of  two  numbers  even  today  given  that  the  delay  incurred  to  add  two  numbers  is  logarithmically
