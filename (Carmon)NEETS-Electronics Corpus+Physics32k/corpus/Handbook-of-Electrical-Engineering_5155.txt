Ferroelectrics  are  the  most  typical  example  of  nonlinear  dielectrics.  Rochelle’s  salt  (potassium  sodium
tartrate)  was  the  ﬁrst  substance  in  which  nonlinearity  was  discovered.  All  ferroelectrics,  however,  possess
nonlinear properties only within a deﬁnite temperature range. The temperature transition points over which
the ferroelectric materials gain or lose their ferroelectric properties are referred to as Curie points. The arsenates
and dihydrogen phosphates of alkali metals are also examples of ferroelectric materials.
