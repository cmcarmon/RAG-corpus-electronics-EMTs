Fiber mismatches are the result of inherent fiber characteristics and are independent of the fiber
jointing techniques. Types of fiber mismatches include fiber geometry mismatches, NA mismatch, and
refractive index profile difference. Fiber geometry mismatches include core diameter, cladding diameter,
core ellipticity, and core-cladding concentricity differences. Figure 4-8 illustrates each type of optical and
geometrical fiber mismatch. Navy fiber specifications tightly specify these parameters to minimize
coupling losses from fiber mismatches.
