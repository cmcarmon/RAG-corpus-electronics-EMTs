has time-stationary dynamic
properties  and  the  human  has,  after  architectural,  learning,  and  adaptation  phases,  achieved  a  similar  state.
Under these circumstances human dynamic operations can be characterized by quasi-linear describing functions
and a remnant [Graham and McRuer, 1961] or operator-induced noise. This is the context here.
