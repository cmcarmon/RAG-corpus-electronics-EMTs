To obtain a high-range resolution, the pulse is usually com-
pressed. Pulse compression is the process of transmitting a
wide pulse to achieve large radiated energy and processing it
to a narrow pulse to obtain ﬁne-range resolution. The trans-
mitted pulse is called the expanded pulse, and the processed
pulse is called the compressed pulse. The received signal is
processed by passing it through a matched ﬁlter. The ratio of
the transmitted pulse width to the compressed (or processed)
pulse width is called the pulse compression ratio.
