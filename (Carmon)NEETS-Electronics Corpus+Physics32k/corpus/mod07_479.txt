ripple senses a voltage divider consisting of R1 and C2 between the output of the rectifier and ground. 
Therefore, most of the ripple voltage is dropped across R1. Only a trace of the ripple voltage can be seen 
across C2 and the load. In extreme cases where the ripple must be held to an absolute minimum, a second 
stage of RC filtering can be added. In practice, the second stage is rarely required. The RC filter is 
extremely popular because smaller capacitors can be used with good results.
