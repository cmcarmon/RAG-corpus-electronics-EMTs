A practical  limitation  of  the  op  amp  is  that  the  magnitude  of  its
output voltage cannot exceed |VCC|. In other words, the output voltage
is dependent on and is limited by the power supply voltage. Figure 5.5
illustrates  that  the  op  amp  can  operate  in  three  modes,  depending  on
the differential input voltage vd:
