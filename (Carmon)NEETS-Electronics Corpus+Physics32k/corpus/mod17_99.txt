POINT-TO-POINT.â€”Point-to-point systems are established to communicate over long-distance 
trunks or links between fixed terminals. A trunk is normally a message circuit between two points that are 
both switching centers or individual message distribution points. A link is a transmitter-receiver system 
connecting two locations.
