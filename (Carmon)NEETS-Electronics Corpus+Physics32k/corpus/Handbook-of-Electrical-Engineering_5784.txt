The Transformer Core
The core of the power TRANSFORMER is usually made of laminated cold-rolled magnetic steel that is grain
oriented such that the rolling direction is the same as that of the ﬂux lines. This type of core construction tends
 is proportional to the square of the
to reduce the eddy current and hysteresis losses. The eddy current loss 
t
 (m) of the individual steel
product of the maximum ﬂux density 
lamination.
