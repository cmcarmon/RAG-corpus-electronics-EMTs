The EU has approved a set of standards called the European Norms (EN). One of the EMC directives contains
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) test requirements for individual equipment approval. The
IEC  series  of  standards  currently  called  upon  by  the  EMC  directive  for  generic  equipment  are  EN  50081-1
(Generic  Emission  Standard;  Part  1,  residential,  commercial  and  light  industry)  and  EN  50082-1  (Generic
Immunity Standard; Part 1, residential, commercial, and light industry equipment). These standards reference
the IEC documents which list the requirements for measurement of emission and immunity characteristics.
