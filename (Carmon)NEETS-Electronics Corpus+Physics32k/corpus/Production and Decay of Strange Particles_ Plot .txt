While experimenting on subatomic particles, a team of physics researchers start a chain reaction that seemingly controls the researchers themselves. As one scientist after another is consumed and turned into nuclear 'zombies' by what seems to be a form of sentient particles from another dimension, the reaction grows towards a terrible climax, and the survivors fear they may be powerless to stop it. Just as the ever-expanding particles are about to engulf the lab and explode into an atomic cataclysm that could destroy the world, the head of the research facility calculates a formula to reverse the effects of the reaction, incorporates a random element, and succeeds in desensitizing the new lifeform, rendering it powerless.
