Earth's mass is constantly changing due to many contributors. Earth primarily gains mass from micrometeorites and cosmic dust, whereas it loses hydrogen and helium gas. The combined effect is a net loss of material, though the annual mass deficit represents an inconsequential fraction of its total mass, or even the uncertainty in its mass. So its inclusion does not affect total mass calculations. A number of other mechanisms are responsible for mass adjustments, and can be classified into two categories: physical transfer of matter, and mass that is gained or lost through the absorption or release of energy due to the massâ€“energy equivalence principle. Several examples are provided for completeness, but their relative contribution is negligible.
