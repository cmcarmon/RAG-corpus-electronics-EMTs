where ¯e is a column vector of unknown voltages and ¯s is the column vector of
known source amplitudes. ¯G is called the conductance matrix and ¯S is called
the source matrix for reasons that will be apparent shortly. In Equation 3.22,
written at the e1 node, we note from Figure 3.12 that the coefficient of the e1
term (the first term in the first row of the ¯G matrix) is the sum of the conduc-
tances connected to the e1 node. Similarly in Equation 3.23, the coefficient of
the e2 term (the second term in the second row of the ¯G matrix) is the sum
of the conductances connected to the e2 node. (These terms are often called
the ‘‘self ’’ conductances.) The off-diagonal coefficients represent conductances
connected between the corresponding nodes, the ‘‘mutual’’ conductances. In
Equation 3.22, for example, the coefficient of the e2 term (the second term in
the first row of the ¯G matrix) is the mutual conductance between the e1 node
(because this is the e1 equation) and e2. For linear resistive circuits, the off-
diagonal terms are negative, assuming that the equations have been structured
to make the main-diagonal terms positive.
