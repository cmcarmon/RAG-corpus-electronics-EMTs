In the final chapter of his 1997 book "The Fabric of Reality" physicist David Deutsch considers the Tiplerian Omega Point. Though he criticizes Tipler for making exaggerated physical claims concerning his Omega Point theory, Deutsch stipulates a contracting universe that includes universal quantum computers could prolong the usefulness of the universe given the inevitability of an Omega Point collapse.
