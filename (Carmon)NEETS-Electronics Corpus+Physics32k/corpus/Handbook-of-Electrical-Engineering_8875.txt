Two factors drive the existence of multiple levels of cache memory in the memory hierarchy: access times
and a limited number of transistors on the CPU chip. Larger banks with greater capacity are slower than smaller
banks. If the time needed to access the cache limits the clock frequency of the CPU, then the ﬁrst-level cache
size may need to be constrained. Much of the beneﬁt of a large cache may be obtained by placing a small ﬁrst-
level cache above a larger second-level cache; the ﬁrst is accessed quickly and the second holds more data close
to the processor. Since many modern CPUs have caches on the CPU chip itself, the size of the cache is limited
by the CPU silicon real-estate. Some CPU designers have assumed that system designers will add large off-chip
caches to the one or two levels of caches on the processor chip. The complexity of this part of the memory
hierarchy may continue to grow as main memory access penalties continue to increase.
