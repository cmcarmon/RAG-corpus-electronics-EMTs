Figure  47.14  shows  a  typical  single-pole,  single-cavity,  two-port  SAW  resonator.  Resonators  can  be  made
multipole by addition of multiple cavities, which can be accomplished by inline acoustic coupling, transverse
acoustic coupling, and by electrical coupling. The equivalent circuit for SAW two-port and one-port resonators
is  shown  in  Fig. 47.15.  SAW  resonators  have  low  insertion  loss  and  high  electrical  Qâ€™s  of  several  thousand
[Campbell, 1989; Datta, 1986; Morgan, 1985].
