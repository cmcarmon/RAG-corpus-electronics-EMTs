Gap ﬁller: A low-power transmitter that boosts the strength of transmitted DAB RF signals in areas which
normally would be shadowed due to terrain obstruction. Gap ﬁllers can operate on the same frequency
as  DAB  transmissions  or  on  alternate  channels  that  can  be  located  by  DAB  receivers  using  automatic
switching.
