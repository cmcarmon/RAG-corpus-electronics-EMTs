Envihab is designed for long-term medical habitat research which in general will strengthen Cologne and North Rhine-Westphalia as a location for aerospace business and science and will sharpen the profile of the DLR as a national and international research center of excellence in the field of aerospace medicine. Supported by the Regionale 2010 a research facility will be built that will supply scientific progress and economic surplus based on results that can be used by the industry. At the same time Envihab will increase the publicâ€™s awareness for centralquestions of the future concerning life on Earth.
The new research facility of the DLR will create the basis for conducting integrative research in the field of life sciences on the highest international level.
Prior to conducting an experiment in orbit, the parameters of the project are being investigated on Earth. This applies to technical and material science experiments and is even more important when humans in space are involved or medical experiments are conducted.
In the future, the scientists of the Institute of Aerospace Medicine of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) will have a modern and ideal research facility customized to their needs at their disposal to conduct their studies: the Envihab.
