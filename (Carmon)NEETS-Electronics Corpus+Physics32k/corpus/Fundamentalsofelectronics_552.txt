post-sampling ﬁlters. They sample at high frequencies, 44.1 kHz for example, and hope the signal contains
no frequencies above the Nyquist frequency (22.05 kHz in our example). If, however, the signal contains
frequencies beyond the sound card’s Nyquist frequency, the resulting aliasing can be impossible to remove.
