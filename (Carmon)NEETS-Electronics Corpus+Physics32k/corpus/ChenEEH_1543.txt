Redirection of standard input and output and ﬁlters work
the same way as in UNIX and even use the same notation.
Pipes are also allowed, but they are implemented differently
(using temporary ﬁles), which introduces
subtle
changes in their behavior. Other features taken from UNIX
are shell variables, prompts that can be set by users, and shell
scripts.
