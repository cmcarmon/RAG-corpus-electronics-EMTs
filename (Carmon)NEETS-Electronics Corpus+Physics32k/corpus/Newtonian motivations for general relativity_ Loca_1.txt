A local coordinate system for a space craft co-moving with one of the particles can again be defined. The



z


{\displaystyle z}
-direction, toward the ceiling, is in the direction of




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
. The



x


{\displaystyle x}
-direction, toward the front of the craft, is perpendicular to




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
but still in the plane of the trajectory. Unlike in a circular orbit, this craft no longer necessarily points in the direction of the velocity. The



y


{\displaystyle y}
-direction is toward the left side of the craft.
