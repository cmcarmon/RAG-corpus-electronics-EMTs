A counter is a logic circuit that can count a sequence 
of numbers or states when activated by a clock input. 
The output of a counter indicates the binary number 
stored in the counter at any given time. The number 
of counts or states through which a counter progresses 
before returning to its original state (recycling) is 
called the modulus of the counter.
