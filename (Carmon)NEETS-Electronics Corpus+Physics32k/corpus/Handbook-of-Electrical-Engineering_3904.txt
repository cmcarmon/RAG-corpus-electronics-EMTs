where Aem is the maximum effective aperture and Ae is the actual effective aperture of the antenna. Because of
losses in the system, Ae = kAem, where k is the radiation efﬁciency factor. The gain equals the directivity when
there are no losses (k = 1), but is less than the directivity if there are any losses in the antenna (k < 1), that is,
G = kD.
