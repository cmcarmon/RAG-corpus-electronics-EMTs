ear described a system for synchronizing instrumentation throughout an aircraft using DC servo
motors instead of mechanical linkages that loaded down the master instrument. Its greater appli-
cation came in using it to control and maintain altitude and heading by synchronizing the aircraft’s
control surfaces and using the servos to adjust them. This “autopilot” helped reduce pilot fatigue on long
ﬂights and was one of the developments that made commercial air practical during the 1950s and beyond.
The servo control principles described are still used in automated air and sea navigation today.
