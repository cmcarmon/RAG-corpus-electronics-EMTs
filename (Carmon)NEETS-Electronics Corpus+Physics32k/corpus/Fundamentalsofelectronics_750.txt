distance along the transmission line. Expressing γ in terms of its real and imaginary parts in our solution
shows that such increases are a (mathematical) possibility. V (x) = V+e−(a+jb)x + V−e+(a+jb)x The voltage
cannot increase without limit; because a (f ) is always positive, we must segregate the solution for negative
and positive x. The ﬁrst term will increase exponentially for x < 0 unless V+ = 0 in this region; a similar
result applies to V− for x > 0. These physical constraints give us a cleaner solution.
