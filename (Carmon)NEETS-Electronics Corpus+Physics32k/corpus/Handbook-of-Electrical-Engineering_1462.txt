where wk is a nonnegative weighting function and N is the sum of the weights. Path constraints and weighting
functions  are  chosen  to  control  whether  or  not  the  distance  D(F)  is  symmetric  and  the  allowable  degree  of
warping in each direction. Dynamic programming is used to efÔ¨Åciently determine the optimal time alignment
between two feature-vector sequences [Sakoe and Chiba, 1978].
