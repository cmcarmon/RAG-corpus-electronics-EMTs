time and compute the sine-wave voltage developed across each impedance for that generator input. Then, 
combine the instantaneous voltages (caused by each generator input) to obtain the complex waveform 
across each impedance. The nature of the impedance (resistive or reactive) will determine the shape of the 
complex waveform. Because the complex waveform is the sum of two individual sine waves, the 
composite waveform contains only the two original frequencies.
