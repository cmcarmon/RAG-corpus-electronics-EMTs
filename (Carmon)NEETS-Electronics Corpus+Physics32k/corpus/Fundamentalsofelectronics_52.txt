The real-valued terms correspond to the Taylor’s series for cos (θ), the imaginary ones to sin (θ), and Euler’s
ﬁrst relation results. The remaining relations are easily derived from the ﬁrst. Because of the relationship
a2 + b2, we see that multiplying the exponential in (2.3) by a real constant corresponds to setting the
r =
radius of the complex number by the constant.
2.1.3 Calculating with Complex Numbers
Adding and subtracting complex numbers expressed in Cartesian form is quite easy: You add (subtract) the
real parts and imaginary parts separately.
