Before we go into the details of the approximations, we ﬁrst
pose a question: what kind of properties should a lowpass ﬁlter
have to transfer, without distortion, a certain frequency band
and suppress completely all other frequencies. The thought
comes immediately to mind that all components should be
ampliﬁed equally. This is true but not sufﬁcient. In addition,
the phase response must be a straight line; thus, the group
delay must be a constant for all frequencies of interest. The
conditions are sketched in Figure 4.15. We will see that this is
impossible to achieve and that we have to accept some ap-
proximations when comparing with Figures 4.13(A) through
4.13(D) and Figure 4.14.
