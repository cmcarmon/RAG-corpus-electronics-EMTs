To get the light in and out of an integrated optic waveguide requires a tiny optical window to be polished onto
the waveguide’s end. Currently, the entire endface of the substrate is polished to a sharp, nearly perfect corner,
making the whole endface into an optical window. An optical ﬁber can then be aligned to the waveguide end
and attached. Typically, centration of the ﬁber axis to the waveguide axis must be better than 0.2 mm. Some
devices require multiple inputs and outputs. In this case the ﬁbers are prealigned in silicon V-grooves. These
V-grooves are fabricated by anisotropic etching of a photolithographically deﬁned pattern on the silicon. The
center-to-center spacing of the ﬁber V-groove array can be made to closely match that of the multiple waveguide
inputs and outputs.
