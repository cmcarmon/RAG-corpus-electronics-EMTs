60°, the ﬁring of thyristors occurs in the same sequence as they are numbered. The line
commutation of an even-numbered thyristor takes place with the turning on of the next even-
numbered thyristor, and similarly for odd-numbered thyristors. Thus, each thyristor conducts
for 120° and only two thyristors (one odd-numbered and one even-numbered) conduct at
a time.
