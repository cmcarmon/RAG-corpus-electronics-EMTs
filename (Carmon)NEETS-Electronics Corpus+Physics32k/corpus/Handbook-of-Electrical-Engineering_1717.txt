It is impossible to list all possible types of point operations; however, the important thing to remember is
 on its gray level value and
that these operations process one pixel at a time by modifying the pixel based 
not
 where it is distributed spatially (i.e., location in the pixel matrix). These operations are performed to enhance
the image, make it easier to see certain structures or regions in the image, or to force a particular shape to the
histogram  of  the  image.  They  are  also  used  as  initial  operations  in  a  more  complicated  image  processing
algorithm.
