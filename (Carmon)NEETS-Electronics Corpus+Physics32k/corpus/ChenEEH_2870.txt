. A duplexer is a device that allows the transmitter and
the receiver to share the same antenna. On transmission,
it protects the receiver from burnout; on reception, it
directs the echo signal to the receiver. The duplexer
must provide a very large isolation (greater than 60 dB)
between the transmitter and receiver with a very small
loss of the desired signal. Most radar duplexers are in one
of the two types: circulator and TR tube.
