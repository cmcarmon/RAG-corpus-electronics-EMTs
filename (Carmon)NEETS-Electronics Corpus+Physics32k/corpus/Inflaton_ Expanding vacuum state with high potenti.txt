In quantum field theory, vacuum is a state of quantum fields which is at locally minimal potential energy. Quantum particles are excitations which deviate from minimal potential energy state, therefore vacuum state has no particles in it. Depending on the specifics of the theory, a QFT can have more than one vacuum state. Different vacua, despite all "being empty" (having no particles), will generally have different vacuum energy. Quantum field theory stipulates that the pressure of the vacuum energy is always negative and equal in magnitude to its energy density.
Inflationary theory postulates that there is a vacuum state with very large vacuum energy, caused by non-zero vacuum expectation value of the inflaton field. Any region of space in this state will rapidly expand. Even if initially it is not empty (contains some particles), very rapid exponential expansion dilutes particle density to zero.
