You take power measurements from a radar transmitter by sampling the output power. In one 
sampling method, you use a pickup horn in front of the antenna. Air losses and weather conditions make 
the horn placement extremely critical and also affect the accuracy of the sample. A more accurate and 
convenient method can be used. In this method, you sample the output power through a directional 
sampling coupler located at the point in the transmitter where a power reading is desired. Power-amplifier 
transmitters usually have sampling couplers after each stage of amplification.
