Problems 
 
14.1  A  moving  coil  meter  has  a  full-scale 
deflection  current  of  500  µA.  If  the  meter 
 
 
coil  has  a  resistance  of  400  G
, determine 
the value of multiplier resistor if the meter 
 
is  to  be  used  as  a  voltmeter  reading  0  to  
 
 
10 V. 
14.2   A  moving  coil  meter  has  a  full-scale 
 
deflection current of 5 mA. If the meter coil 
has  a  resistance  of  100  G
 
, determine  the 
value of shunt resistor if the meter is to be 
 
 
used as an ammeter reading 0 to 50 mA. 
14.3   A  meter  has  a  full-scale  deflection  of  
60  µA.  What  will  its  ohms-per-volt  rating 
 
 
be? 
14.4   A  50  kG
 
 
14.5   A  digital  multi-range  meter  has  a  3½-digit
