If properly planned and operated, dispersed storage and
generation may provide beneÔ¨Åts to distribution systems by
reducing capacity requirements, improving reliability, and re-
ducing losses. Dispersed-storage-and-generation technologies
include hydroelectric systems, diesel generators, wind-electric
systems, solar-electric systems, batteries, storage space and
water heaters, storage air conditioners, hydroelectric pumped
storage, photovoltaics, and fuel cells.
