Uniform circular motion, that is constant speed along a circular path, is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's linear velocity vector also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:






a


=




v

2




r





{\displaystyle {\textrm {a}}={{v^{2}} \over {r}}}

where



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the object's linear speed along the circular path. Equivalently, the radial acceleration vector (




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
) may be calculated from the object's angular velocity



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
:





a

ω

2




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={-\omega ^{2}}\mathbf {r} }

where




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius. The negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius).
The acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed toward the centre of the circle; that is, it is centripetal. Whereas the so-called 'centrifugal force' appearing to act outward on the body is really a pseudo force experienced in the frame of reference of the body in circular motion, due to the body's linear momentum at a tangent to the circle.
With nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path changes, a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle. That is,




a
=
r
α
.


{\displaystyle a=r\alpha .}

The transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the angular acceleration (



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
).
