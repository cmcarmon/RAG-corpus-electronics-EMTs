The Ô¨Årst step in designing an MEMS device is to decide on
the materials to be used for a particular device. There are
varieties of materials to choose from, and the designer has to
choose materials that are compatible and that yield the max-
imum performance of the device. The designer should have an
understanding of the physical properties and knowledge of the
physical or chemical techniques required to etch or to deposit
these materials. In addition, the designer should know the
effects of any of these processing steps on the properties of
the materials used and, hence, on the performance of the
