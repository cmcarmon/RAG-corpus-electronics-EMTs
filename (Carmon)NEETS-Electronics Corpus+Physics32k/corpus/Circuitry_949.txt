Example 1 
 
The  power  in  a  loudspeaker  is  proportional  to  the 
square  of  the  RMS  output  voltage  and  inversely 
proportional to the impedance of the speaker. Write 
down an equation for the power, P, in terms of the 
voltage, V, and impedance, Z. Obtain a formula for 
P in terms of V and Z.
