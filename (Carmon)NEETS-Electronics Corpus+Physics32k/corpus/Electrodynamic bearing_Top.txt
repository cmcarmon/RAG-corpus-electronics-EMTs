Electrodynamic bearings (EDBs) are contactless electrodynamic suspensions of rotating shafts. Relative to active magnetic bearings (AMB) the passive nature of the levitation achieved by EDBs allows a simpler, more reliable and cheaper solution, opening the field of application to medium and large-scale production.
The working principle is based on the induction of eddy currents in a rotating conductor. When an electrically conducting material is moving in a magnetic field, a current will be generated in the material that counters the change in the magnetic field (known as Lenz' Law). This generates a current that will result in a magnetic field that is oriented opposite to the one from the magnet. The electrically conducting material is thus acting as a magnetic mirror.
