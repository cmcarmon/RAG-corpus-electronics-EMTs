The binary number system has a base of 2 with two distinct digits (bits), 1 and 0. A binary
number is expressed as a string of 0s and 1s, and a binary point if a fraction exists. To convert
the binary to the decimal system, the binary number is expressed in the polynomial form and the
resulting polynomial is evaluated by using the decimal-system addition. For example,
(101101.101)2 = 1 × 25 + 0 × 24 + 1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 + 1 × 2
