The transistor is operated within its linear zone and acts like a controlled source in electronic
ampliÔ¨Åers. It is also used in instrumentation systems as an active device. In digital computers or
other electronic switching systems, a transistor effectively becomes a switch when operated at
the extremes of its nonlinear mode.
