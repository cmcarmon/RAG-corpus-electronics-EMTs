For  reasonable  values  of  the  emitter  degeneration  resistance,  REE,  the  Thévenin  time  constant,  RCmCm,  is
likely to be the dominant contribution to the effective ﬁrst-order time constant, TpCE, attributed to the poles
of a common emitter ampliﬁer. Hence, Cm is the likely device capacitance that dominantly imposes an upper
limit to the achievable 3-dB bandwidth of a common emitter cell. The reason for this substantial bandwidth
sensitivity to Cm is the so-called Miller multiplication factor, say M, which appears as the last bracketed term
on the right-hand side of Eq. (28.19), namely,
