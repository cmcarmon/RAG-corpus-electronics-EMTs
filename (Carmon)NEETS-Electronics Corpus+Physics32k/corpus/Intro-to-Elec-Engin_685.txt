While a JFET behaves much like a depletion MOSFET, there are several minor differences
between JFETs and depletion MOSFETs. First, with vGS < 0, the junction in the JFET carries a
reverse saturation gate current iC
usually be neglected. Second, any positive gate voltage above about 0.6 V would forward-bias the
junction in the JFET, resulting in a large forward gate current. Thus, enhancement-mode operation
is not possible with JFETs. On the side of advantages for JFETs, the channel in a JFET has greater
conduction than the channel in a MOSFET of the same size, and the static characteristic curves
are more nearly horizontal in the active region. Also, JFETs do not generally suffer permanent
damage from excessive gate voltage, whereas MOSFETs would be destroyed.
