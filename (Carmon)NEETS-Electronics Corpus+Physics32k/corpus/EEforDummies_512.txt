By shifting components around a bit, you can create a variety of filter con-
figurations. For instance, by placing the resistor, inductor, and capacitor in 
parallel with each other, you create a circuit that produces the minimum 
 current at the resonant frequency. This sort of resonant circuit tunes out that 
frequency, allowing all others to pass, and is used to create band‚Äêstop  filters. 
You might find such a circuit filtering out the 60 Hz hum that electronic 
equipment sometimes picks up from a nearby power line.
