(3.2.44)
Equation (3.2.44) indicates that the function is zero everywhere except at t = 0, and the area
enclosed is unity. In order to satisfy this, δ(t) becomes inﬁnite at t = 0. The graphical illustration
of a unit-impulse function is shown in Figure 3.2.7. The interpretation of i(t ) = Aδ (t − T ) is
that δ (t − T ) is zero everywhere except at t = T (i.e., the current impulse occurs at t = T ), and
the area under i(t) is A.
