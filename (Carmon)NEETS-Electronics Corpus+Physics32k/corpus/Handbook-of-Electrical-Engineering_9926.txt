3. Reducing the sensitivity to plant parameters. Increasing the open-loop gain Gc(jw)Gp(jw) H(jw) tends
to reduce the variations in the system characteristics due to variations in the parameters of the plant.
4. Rejecting disturbances. Increasing the open-loop gain Gc(jw)Gp(jw)H(jw) tends to reduce the effects of
disturbances  [D(s)  in  Fig.  100.28]  on  the  system  output,  provided  that  the  increase  in  gain  does  not
appear in the direct path from disturbance inputs to the system output.
