Introduction
Pattern recognition and matching and related problems in
optimal search play key roles in speech processing. In this
subsection, we examine some critical algorithms related to
these tasks. The main objective of this material is to introduce
the hidden Markov model (HMM), a critical technology that
serves as a foundation for many aspects of modern speech
recognition systems. The HMM can be considered to be a
stochastic form of the widely used (across many disciplines
and applications) search method known as dynamic program-
issues in pattern
ming (DP). After treating some general
