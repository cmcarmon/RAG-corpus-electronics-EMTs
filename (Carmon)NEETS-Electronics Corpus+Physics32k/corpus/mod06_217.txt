In view B, the positive-going signal is applied to the grid. This causes increased conduction through
the tube, which attempts to drive the cathode to +20 volts. But notice that the top of Ck is still at +10 volts
(remember capacitors oppose a change in voltage). The top plate of Ck is, in effect, 10 volts negative in
relation to the top of Rk. The only way that Ck can follow the signal on the top of Rk (+20 volts) is to
charge through the tube back to the source, from the source to the lower plate of Ck. When Ck charges
through the tube, it acts as the source of current for the cathode. This causes the cathode to remain at +10
volts while the capacitor is charging.
