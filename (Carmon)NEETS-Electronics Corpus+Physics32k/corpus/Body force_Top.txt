A body force is a force that acts throughout the volume of a body. Forces due to gravity, electric fields and magnetic fields are examples of body forces. Body forces contrast with contact forces or the classical definition of surface forces which are exerted to the surface of an object.
Normal forces and shear forces between objects are surface forces and exerted to the surface of an object. All cohesive surface attraction and contact forces between objects are also considered as surface forces.
Fictitious forces such as the centrifugal force, Euler force, and the Coriolis effect are also examples of body forces.
