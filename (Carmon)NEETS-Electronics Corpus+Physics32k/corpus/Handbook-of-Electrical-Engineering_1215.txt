Closed Projection Operators
A solution to the signal restoration problem (14.73) is generally intractable unless restrictive assumptions are
made on the constituent attribute sets. In the previous two subsections, the method of successive projections
and its variations were presented for iteratively ﬁnding a solution when the underlying attribute sets are closed
subspaces, closed linear varieties, or closed convex sets. Unfortunately, some of the more important attribute
sets encountered in signal processing do not fall into any of these categories. This is illustrated by the case in
which the Hilbert space is taken to be Cm · n and one of the attribute sets corresponds to all  m · n matrices
which have rank q where q < min(m,n). It is readily shown that this set is neither a subspace nor a linear variety,
nor is it convex. Thus, use of the extremely important rank q attribute set cannot be justiﬁed for any of the
algorithms considered up to this point. This is a serious shortcoming when it is realized that this attribute set
is used so extensively in many contemporary signal processing applications.
