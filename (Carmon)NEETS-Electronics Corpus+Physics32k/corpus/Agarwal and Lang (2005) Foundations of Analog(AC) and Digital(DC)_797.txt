Suppose we are given the faulty circuit in Figure 5.46a where the output of NAND
gate N2 is known to have a stuck-at fault. However, we do not know whether it is a
stuck-at-1 fault or a stuck-at-0 fault. Further, as illustrated in Figure 5.46b, suppose
that we have access only to the inputs A, B, and C, and the output Z. In other
words, we are unable to directly observe the output X of the faulty NAND gate
N2. How would you go about determining whether N2 suffers from a stuck-at-1
fault or a stuck-at-0 fault?
