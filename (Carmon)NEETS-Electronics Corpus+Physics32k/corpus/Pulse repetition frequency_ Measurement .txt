PRF is crucial for systems and devices that measure distance.
Radar
Laser range finder
Sonar
Different PRF allow systems to perform very different functions.
A radar system uses a radio frequency electromagnetic signal reflected from a target to determine information about that target.
PRF is required for radar operation. This is the rate at which transmitter pulses are sent into air or space.
