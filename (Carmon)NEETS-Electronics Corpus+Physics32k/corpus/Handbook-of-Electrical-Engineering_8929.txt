This patent, along with two others, describes a system for tabulating statistical items represented by
holes  punched  in  cards.  The  1890  U.S.  census  was  completed  $5  million  under  budget  and  two  years
ahead of schedule because of Hollerith’s system. The punch card system with encoded holes (the code
for  representing  alphanumeric  characters  with  holes  was  named  after  Hollerith)  was  widely  used  for
sorting, counting, and tabulating even into the 1980s. Hollerith’s original Tabulating Machine Company
was the forerunner to the computer giant, IBM. (Copyright © 1995, DewRay Products, Inc. Used with
