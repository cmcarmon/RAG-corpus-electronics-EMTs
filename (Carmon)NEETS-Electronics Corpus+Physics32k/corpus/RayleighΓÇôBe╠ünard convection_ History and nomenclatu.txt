Rayleigh–Bénard convection, whose effects are due solely to a temperature gradient, was first successfully analyzed by Lord Rayleigh; Rayleigh assumed boundary conditions in which the vertical velocity component and temperature disturbance vanish at the top and bottom boundaries (perfect thermal conduction). Those assumptions resulted in the analysis losing any connection with Henri Bénard's experiment. This resulted in discrepancies between theoretical and experimental results until Pearson reworked the problem based on surface tension. This is what was originally observed by Bénard. Nonetheless in modern usage "Rayleigh–Bénard convection" refers to the effects due to temperature, whereas "Bénard–Marangoni convection" refers specifically to the effects of surface tension. Davis and Koschmieder have suggested that the convection should be rightfully called the "Pearson–Bénard convection".
Rayleigh–Bénard convection is also sometimes known as "Bénard–Rayleigh convection", "Bénard convection", or "Rayleigh convection".
