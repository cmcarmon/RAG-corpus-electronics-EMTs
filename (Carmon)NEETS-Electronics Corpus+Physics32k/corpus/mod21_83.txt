Meggers produce the large voltages that are required to measure resistances as high as 10,000
megohms â€” only high resistance values can be measured. The unknown resistance is connected between
the megger terminals, and the hand generator part of the meter is cranked. Some meggers are capable of
producing in excess of 500 volts, so use caution when you operate them. Typical applications for a
megger are testing unterminated transmission lines and ac power cords for insulation breakdown.
