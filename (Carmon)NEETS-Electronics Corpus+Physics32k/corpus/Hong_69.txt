When  a  negative  electric  field  is  applied  from  anode  to  cathode,  the  depletion  region 
enlarges and it becomes even more difficult to conduct current across the junction. This is 
the  reverse-conducting  state.  When  a  positive  electric  field  is  applied  from  anode  to 
cathode, the depletion region narrows and allows current to conduct from the anode to the 
cathode. This is the forward-conducting state.
