The acceptance angle is related to the refractive indices of the core, cladding, and medium
surrounding the fiber. This relationship is called the numerical aperture of the fiber. The numerical
aperture (NA) is a measurement of the ability of an optical fiber to capture light. The NA is also used to
define the acceptance cone of an optical fiber.
