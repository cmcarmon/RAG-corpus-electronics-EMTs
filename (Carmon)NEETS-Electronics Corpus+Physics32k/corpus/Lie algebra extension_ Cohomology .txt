For the present purposes, consideration of a limited portion of the theory Lie algebra cohomology suffices. The definitions are not the most general possible, or even the most common ones, but the objects they refer to are authentic instances of more the general definitions.
2-cocycles
The objects of primary interest are the 2-cocycles on g, defined as bilinear alternating functions,




ϕ
:


g


×


g


→
F
,


{\displaystyle \phi :{\mathfrak {g}}\times {\mathfrak {g}}\rightarrow F,}

that are alternating,




ϕ
(

G

1


,

G

2


)
=
−
ϕ
(

G

2


,

G

1


)
,


{\displaystyle \phi (G_{1},G_{2})=-\phi (G_{2},G_{1}),}

and having a property resembling the Jacobi identity called the Jacobi identity for 2-cycles,




ϕ

]
)

ϕ

)
=
0.


{\displaystyle \phi (G_{1},[G_{2},G_{3}])+\phi (G_{2},[G_{3},G_{1}])+\phi (G_{3},[G_{1},G_{2}])=0.}

The set of all 2-cocycles on g is denoted Z2(g, F).
2-cocycles from 1-cochains
Some 2-cocycles can be obtained from 1-cochains. A 1-cochain on g is simply a linear map,




f
:


g


→
F


{\displaystyle f:{\mathfrak {g}}\rightarrow F}

The set of all such maps is denoted C1(g, F) and, of course (in at least the finite-dimensional case) C1(g, F) ≅ g*. Using a 1-cochain f, a 2-cocycle δf may be defined by




δ
f
(

G

1


,

G

2


)
=
f
(
[

G

1


,

G

2


]
)
.


{\displaystyle \delta f(G_{1},G_{2})=f([G_{1},G_{2}]).}

The alternating property is immediate and the Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles is (as usual) shown by writing it out and using the definition and properties of the ingredients (here the Jacobi identity on g and the linearity of f). The linear map δ:C1(g, F) → Z2(g, F) is called the coboundary operator (here restricted to C1(g, F)).
The second cohomology group
Denote the image of C1(g, F) of δ by B2(g, F). The quotient





H

(


g


,

F

)
=

Z

(


g


,

F

)

/

(


g


,

F

)


{\displaystyle H^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {F} )=Z^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {F} )/B^{2}({\mathfrak {g}},\mathbb {F} )}

is called the second cohomology group of g. Elements of H2(g, F) are equivalence classes of 2-cocycles and two 2-cocycles φ1 and φ2 are called equivalent cocycles if they differ by a 2-coboundary, i.e. if φ1 = φ2 + δf for some f ∈ C1(g, F). Equivalent 2-cocycles are called cohomologous. The equivalence class of φ ∈ Z2(g, F) is denoted [φ] ∈ H2.
These notions generalize in several directions. For this, see the main articles.
