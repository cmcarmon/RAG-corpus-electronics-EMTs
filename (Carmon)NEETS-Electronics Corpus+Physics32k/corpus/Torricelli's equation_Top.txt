In physics, Torricelli's equation, or Torricelli's formula, is an equation created by Evangelista Torricelli to find the final velocity of an object moving with a constant acceleration along an axis (for example, the x axis) without having a known time interval.
The equation itself is:

{\displaystyle {v_{f}}_{x}^{2}={v_{i}}_{x}^{2}+2a_{x}\Delta x\,}

where







v

{\displaystyle {v_{f}}_{x}}
is the object's final velocity along the x axis on which the acceleration is constant.







v

i




x




{\displaystyle {v_{i}}_{x}}
is the object's initial velocity along the x axis.





a

x




{\displaystyle a_{x}}
is the object's acceleration along the x axis, which is given as a constant.




Δ
x



{\displaystyle \Delta x\,}
is the object's change in position along the x axis, also called displacement.
This equation is valid along any axis on which the acceleration is constant.
