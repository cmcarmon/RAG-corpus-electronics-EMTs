Practical power supply circuits 
 
Figure  6.20  shows  a  simple  power  supply  circuit 
capable  of  delivering  an  output  current  of  up  to  
250  mA.  The  circuit  uses  a  full-wave  bridge 
rectifier arrangement (Dl to D4) and a simple Câ€“R 
filter. The output voltage is regulated by the shunt-
connected 12 V zener diode.
