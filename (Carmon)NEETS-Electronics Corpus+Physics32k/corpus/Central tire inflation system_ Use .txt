CTIS was first used in production on the American DUKW amphibious truck which was introduced in 1942.
The Czech heavy military 8x8 truck Tatra T813's central inflation and deflation system was designed to maintain pressure even after multiple bullet punctures. Military Tatra trucks are equipped with CTIS as standard.
From 1984, GM offered CTIS for the Chevrolet Blazer and various pick-ups. Several trucks used by the U.S. military also have CTIS (e.g. the HMMWV and its civilian counterpart, the Hummer H1). The feature is also common in Soviet and Russian military trucks.
