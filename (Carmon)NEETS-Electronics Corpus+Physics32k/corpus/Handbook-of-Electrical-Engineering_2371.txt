Conclusion
The  decision  to  use  an  equivalent  circuit  model  or  a  device  simulator  depends  upon  the  designer  and  the
required  accuracy  of  prediction.  To  save  computational  time,  one  should  use  as  simple  a  model  as  accuracy
will allow. At this time, however, the trend is toward developing quantum mechanical models that are more
accurate, and with faster computers available, the computational time for these simulators has been considerably
reduced.
