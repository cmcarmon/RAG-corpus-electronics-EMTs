The speed an ideal photon rocket will reach, in the absence of external forces, depends on the ratio of its initial and final mass:

{\displaystyle v=c{\frac {\left({\frac {m_{i}}{m_{f}}}\right)^{2}-1}{\left({\frac {m_{i}}{m_{f}}}\right)^{2}+1}}}

where




m

{\displaystyle m_{i}}
is the initial mass and

{\displaystyle m_{f}}
is the final mass.
The gamma factor corresponding to this speed has the simple expression:
