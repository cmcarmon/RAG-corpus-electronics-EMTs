A relay is essentially an electromechanical switch that opens and closes electrical contacts. A
simpliﬁed relay is represented in Figure E12.4.4. It is required to keep the fenomagnetic plate at a
distance of 0.25 cm from the electromagnet excited by a coil of N = 5000 turns, when the torque
is 10 N · m at a radius r = 10 cm. Estimate the current required, assuming inﬁnitely permeable
magnetic material and negligible fringing as well as leakage.
