An advantage of the crimp-on solderless terminal lugs is that they require relatively little operator 
skill to use. Another advantage is that the only tool needed is the crimping tool. This allows terminal lugs 
to be applied with a minimum of time and effort. The connections are made rapidly, are clean, and 
uniform in construction. Because of the pressures exerted and the material used, the crimped connection 
or splice, properly made, is both mechanically and electrically sound. Some of the basic types of 
terminals are shown in figure 2-11. There are several variations of these basic types, such as the use of a 
slot instead of a terminal hole, three- and four-way splice-type connectors, and others.
