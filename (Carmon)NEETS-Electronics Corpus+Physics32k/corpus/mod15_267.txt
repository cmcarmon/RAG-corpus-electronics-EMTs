The VOLTMETER ZEROING METHOD is the most accurate and requires a precision voltmeter. 
This method has two major steps-the coarse or approximate setting and the fine setting. The coarse setting 
ensures the synchro is not zeroed 180ยบ away from its reference. This setting may be approximated 
physically by aligning two marks on the synchro. The fine setting is where the synchro is precisely set on 
0ยบ .
