The E mode functions as the D gear in a full automatic car. Via the onboard computer and electronic clutch, the car automatically selects the appropriate gear based on speed and gradient information. An MMT car limits the highest gear selectable, if the gradient is steep.
L and 2 gear in a full automatic: The L and 2 gear in automatic can be simulated in an MMT car by either using E1/E2 or M1/M2.
Es mode: Es mode allows more dynamic and sporty driving with faster gear changes, at the expense of greater fuel consumption. Es mode is available in the Yaris and Auris (in Europe). Es mode is similar to the S mode in Direct-Shift Gearbox.
