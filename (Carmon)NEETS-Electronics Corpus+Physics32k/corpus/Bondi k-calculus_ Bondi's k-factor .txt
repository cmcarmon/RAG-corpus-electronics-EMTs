Consider two inertial observers, Alice and Bob, moving directly away from each other at constant relative velocity. Alice sends a flash of blue light towards Bob once every



T


{\displaystyle T}
seconds, as measured by her own clock. Because Alice and Bob are separated by a distance, there is a delay between Alice sending a flash and Bob receiving a flash. Furthermore, the separation distance is steadily increasing at a constant rate, so the delay keeps on increasing. This means that the time interval between Bob receiving the flashes, as measured by his clock, is greater than



T


{\displaystyle T}
seconds, say



k
T


{\displaystyle kT}
seconds for some constant



k

1


{\displaystyle k>1}
. (If Alice and Bob were, instead, moving directly towards each other, a similar argument would apply, but in that case



k
<
1


{\displaystyle k<1}
.)
Bondi describes



k


{\displaystyle k}
as “a fundamental ratio”, and other authors have since called it "the Bondi k-factor" or "Bondi's k-factor".
Alice's flashes are transmitted at a frequency of

=

{\displaystyle f_{s}=1/T}
Hz, by her clock, and received by Bob at a frequency of

{\displaystyle f_{o}=1/(kT)}
Hz, by his clock. This implies a Doppler factor of

{\displaystyle f_{s}/f_{o}=k}
. So Bondi's k-factor is another name for the Doppler factor (when source Alice and observer Bob are moving directly away from or towards each other).
If Alice and Bob were to swap roles, and Bob sent flashes of light to Alice, the Principle of Relativity (Einstein's first postulate) implies that the k-factor from Bob to Alice would be the same value as the k-factor from Alice to Bob, as all inertial observers are equivalent. So the k-factor depends only on the relative speed between the observers and nothing else.
