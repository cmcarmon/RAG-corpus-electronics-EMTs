Circle-throw vibrating screens operate on an inclined surface. A deck moves in a circle. It operates with a continuous feed rather than in batches, leading to much greater output. The incline allows the feed to move through the device.
Circle-throw machines are larger than others, and may require greater space than other screening units. Fine, wet, sticky materials require a water spray to wash fine materials under spray bars. Circle-throws have a large stroke and allow heavy components to circulate and interfere with the screen box. A powerful motor is needed, while other separators may not.
Circle throw separation does not produce a separate waste stream. The feed is separated into multiple streams, with the number of exit streams matching the number of decks. Circle throw separation usually follows a grinding process. The coarser upper deck stream(s) can be directly re-fed into the grinding units due to continuous operation, thus reducing transport time, costs and storage.
