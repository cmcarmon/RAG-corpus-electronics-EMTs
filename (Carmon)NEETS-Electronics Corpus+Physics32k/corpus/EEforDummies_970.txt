Schematics use symbols to represent resistors, transistors, and other circuit 
components, and lines to show connections between components. By read-
ing the symbols and following the interconnections, you can build the circuit 
shown in the schematic. Schematics can also help you understand how a 
circuit operates, which comes in handy when youâ€™re testing or repairing the 
circuit.
