Figure 10.107 (Problem 10.8 in the chapter on first-order tran-
sients) illustrated a parasitic inductance associated with VLSI package pins. Figure 12.78
is a modification of Figure 10.107 and shows a lumped parasitic capacitor CP associated
with the power node within the VLSI chip. In this problem, we will study the combined
effect of the parasitic inductance LP and capacitance CP.
