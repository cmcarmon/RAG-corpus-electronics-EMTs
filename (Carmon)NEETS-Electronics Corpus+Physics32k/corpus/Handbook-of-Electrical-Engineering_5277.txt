Since the output of an individual cell is rather low (1 or 2 W at a fraction of a volt), several (30 to 60) cells
are combined to form a module. Typical module ratings range from 40 to 50 W at 15 to 17 V. PV modules are
progressively put together to form panels, arrays (strings or trackers), groups, segments (subÔ¨Åelds), and ulti-
mately  a  PV  plant  consisting  of  several  segments.  Plants  rated  at  several  MW  have  been  built  and  operated
successfully.
