As you have learned, a free gyro maintains its spin axis fixed in space, and not fixed relative to the 
Earth's surface. To understand this, imagine yourself in a space ship somewhere out in space and looking 
at the South Pole of the Earth. You see a sphere rotating clockwise, with the South Pole in the center. 
Maneuver your ship until it is on a direct line with the South Pole and then cut in the automatic controls to 
keep it in this position. You will now see the Earth make a complete rotation every 24 hours.
