Pyroelectric  devices  detect  changes  in  temperature  in  the  sensitive  material  and  as  such  are  detectors  of
supplied energy. It can be seen that the pyroelectric current is proportional to the rate of change of the material
with time and that in order to obtain a measurable signal, it is necessary to modulate the source of energy. As
energy detectors, they are most frequently applied to the detection of incident electromagnetic energy, partic-
ularly in the infrared wavebands.
