Klystron amplifiers have been built with as many as five intermediate cavities in addition to the input 
and output cavities. The effect of the intermediate cavities is to improve the electron bunching process 
which improves amplifier gain. The overall efficiency of the tube is also improved to a lesser extent. 
Adding more cavities is roughly the same as adding more stages to a conventional amplifier. The overall 
amplifier gain is increased and the overall bandwidth is reduced if all the stages are tuned to the same 
frequency. The same effect occurs with multicavity klystron tuning. A klystron amplifier tube will deliver 
high gain and a narrow bandwidth if all the cavities are tuned to the same frequency. This method of 
tuning is called SYNCHRONOUS TUNING. If the cavities are tuned to slightly different frequencies, the 
gain of the amplifier will be reduced but the bandwidth will be appreciably increased. This method of 
tuning is called STAGGERED TUNING.
