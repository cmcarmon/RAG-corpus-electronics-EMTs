The attenuator usually consists of two controls. One is a multiposition (VOLTS/DIV) control, and
the other is a variable (VAR) potentiometer. Each position of the control may be marked either as to the
amount of voltage required to deflect the beam a unit distance, such as VOLTS/DIV, or as to the amount
of attenuation (called the DEFLECTION FACTOR) given to the signal, such as 100, 10, or 1.
