The RC INTEGRATOR is used as a waveshaping network in communications, radar, and 
computers. The harmonic content of the square wave is made up of odd multiples of the fundamental 
frequency. Therefore SIGNIFICANT HARMONICS (those that have an effect on the circuit) as high as 
50 or 60 times the fundamental frequency will be present in the wave. The capacitor will offer a reactance 
(XC) of a different magnitude to each of the harmonics
