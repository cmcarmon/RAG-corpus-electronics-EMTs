In one form, the navigational system of equations acquires linear and angular measurements from the inertial and body frame, respectively and calculates the final attitude and position in the NED frame of reference.

Where: f is specific force,



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is angular rate, a is acceleration, R is position,






R
˙





{\displaystyle {\dot {R}}}
and V are velocity,



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
is the angular velocity of the earth, g is the acceleration due to gravity,



Φ
,
λ


{\displaystyle \Phi ,\lambda }
and h are the NED location parameters. Also, super/subscripts of E, I and B are representing variables in the Earth centered, Inertial or Body reference frame, respectively and C is a transformation of reference frames.
