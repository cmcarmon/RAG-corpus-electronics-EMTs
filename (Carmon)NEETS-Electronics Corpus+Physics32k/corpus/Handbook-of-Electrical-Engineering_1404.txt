function of the noisy signal is now associated with one of the words in the vocabulary in a way which minimizes
the probability of classiÔ¨Åcation error. The only difference between the two problems is that the sample functions
of the clean and noisy signals from a given word have different statistics. The problem in both cases is that of
partitioning the sample space of the given acoustic signals from all words in the vocabulary into L partition
cells, where L is the number of words in the vocabulary.
