Mass: 8,500 kg
Power: 2,500 W
Internal data rate: 7 Gbit/s
Data rate to ground: 2 Mbit/s (typical, average)
Primary mission duration: 10 to 18 years
Magnetic field intensity: 0.15 teslas produced by a 1,200 kg permanent neodymium magnet
Original superconducting magnet: 2 coils of niobium-titanium at 1.8 K producing a central field of 0.87 teslas
AMS-02 flight magnet changed to non-superconducting AMS-01 version to extend experiment life and to solve reliability problems in the operation of the superconducting system
About 1,000 cosmic rays are recorded by the instrument per second, generating about one GB/sec of data. This data is filtered and compressed to about 300 kB/sec for download to the operation center POCC at CERN.
