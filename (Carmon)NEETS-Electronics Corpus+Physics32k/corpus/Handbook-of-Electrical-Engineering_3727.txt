The  remanent  magnetization  of  a  medium  is  important  because  it  directly  affects  the  signal  level  during
readback  as  shown  by  Eq. (36.4).  The  remanent  magnetizations  of  several  particulate  media  are  listed  in
Table 36.6. Obtaining high remanent magnetization in particulate media requires the use of particles with high
saturation magnetization and a high-volume packing fraction of particles in the polymer binder. Obtaining
a high-volume packing fraction of particles in the binder, however, can lead to nonuniform distributions of
particles and agglomerates of many particles, which switch together, also causing noise during readback.
