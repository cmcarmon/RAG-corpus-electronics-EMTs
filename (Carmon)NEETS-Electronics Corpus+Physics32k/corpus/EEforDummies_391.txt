With the switch in the charge position, the battery is connected to the circuit 
and current flows as the capacitor charges. LED1 lights temporarily, as cur-
rent flows through it, for as long as it takes the capacitor to charge. After the 
capacitor stops charging, current no longer flows and LED1 goes out. Note 
that LED2 is oriented “backwards” so current does not pass through it as the 
capacitor charges.
