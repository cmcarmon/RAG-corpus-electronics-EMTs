Fiber optic cables use strength members to increase the cables' strength and protect the fiber from
strain. Fiber optic cables may use central support members in cable construction. The central support
members generally have buffered fibers or single fiber sub-cables stranded over their surface in a
structured, helical manner. The central members may support the optical fibers as cable strength members
or may only serve as fillers. Strength and support members must be light and flexible. In commercial
applications, the materials used for strength and support include steel wire and textile fibers (such as
nylon and arimid yarn). They also include carbon fibers, glass fibers, and glass reinforced plastics. For
Navy applications, only non-metallic strength and support members are allowed.
