Finally, to complete the node analysis, the solution for e could be used in Step 5
of node analysis to determine the branch voltages and then the branch currents
in the circuit. While we will not do this here, it is worthwhile to see that it will
yield the same results as in Equations 3.10 through 3.16, providing that the
branch currents and voltages are defined in the same manner. To see that this
will be the case, observe that e in Equation 3.37 is the same as in Equation 3.9
except for a minus sign, owing to the change in the sign of e as defined in
Figures 3.10 and 3.21.
