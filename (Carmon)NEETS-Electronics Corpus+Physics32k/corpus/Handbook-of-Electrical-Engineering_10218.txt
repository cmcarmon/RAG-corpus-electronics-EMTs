The ARTS  systems  were  designed  to  work
with  the  company’s  CFD  (Constant/con-
trolled Force Device) product line, a series of
end effectors and bench mounted devices for
controlling  the  constant  pressure  of  abrasive
tools used to deburr, grind, polish, and ﬁnish
products fabricated by welding, casting, mold-
ing, forging, or machining.
