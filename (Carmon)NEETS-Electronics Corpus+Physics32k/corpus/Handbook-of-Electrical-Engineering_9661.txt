Many  textbooks  describe  operating  system  concepts.  The  three  cited  in  the  reference  section  [Dietel,  1990;
Silberschatz  et al.,  1991;  and  Tanenbaum,  1992]  are  excellent.  The  IEEE  Computer  Society  has  a  number  of
tutorials on operating system related topics such as fault tolerance, real-time, local area networks and distributed
processing.  Readers  should  contact  the  Computer  Society  Press  ofÔ¨Åce  at  10662  Los  Vaqueros  Circle,  Los
