An  alternate  approach  is  the  continuous  spray  design  where  a  smaller  nozzle  (10–20  mm)  is  used.  Much
smaller drops are produced at higher velocities (»40 m/s). It is often called the Hertz method [see Fig. 89.28(b)].
As with the continuous drop approach, a controlled voltage electrode is positioned around the breakoff point
of the jet stream, a conductive ink is used, and the smaller droplets are charged proportionally to the applied
voltage. The stream of droplets is directed to the paper when no voltage is applied. When a voltage is applied,
the  resulting  electrostatic  charge  on  the  droplets  produces  strong  mutual  repulsion  forces  and  the  stream
transforms into a spray, the cone angle of which is determined by the applied voltage. The spray is intercepted
by a collecting surface surrounding the collection oriﬁce which allows only uncharged or low-charged droplets
through to the paper. With analog voltage control, the amount of spray that passes through the oriﬁce can be
varied,  thus  providing  gray-scale  capability.  This  approach  (with  multiple  oriﬁces)  has  been  commercialized
for very high-quality color image and graphics applications.
