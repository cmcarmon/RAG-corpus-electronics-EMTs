Ampliﬁer noise arises from both thermal sources (resistances) and nonthermal sources
(semiconductor devices). Although nonthermal noise is not related to physical temperature and
does not necessarily have a uniform spectrum like that of thermal noise, one still refers to an
ampliﬁer’s noise temperature Ta, for convenience, as a measure of noisiness referred to the input.
The model of a noisy ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 14.3.7(a) with input noise N = ηB = kT B
from a source at temperature T, and the output power given by
