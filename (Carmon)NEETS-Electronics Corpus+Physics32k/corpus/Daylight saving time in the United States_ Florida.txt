Daylight time is less useful in Florida compared to other states because its southern location leads to less variations in day length between winter and summer. Without DST, Miami, for instance, would experience similar sunrise and sunset times throughout the year to cities including Honolulu or Hong Kong, which have both abandoned DST for decades. There is opposition to DST in Florida. State senator Bill Posey introduced a bill in March 2008 to abolish daylight time in the state and keep Florida on year-round standard time. Because Florida straddles two time zones, the Florida legislature has the option of returning all or part of the state to standard time along time zone boundaries (i.e. placing the portion of the state in the Eastern time zone on standard time, while leaving the portion in the Central time zone on DST, so that the whole state had a common time). On March 6, 2018 the Florida State Senate approved the “Sunshine Protection Act” that puts Florida on Daylight Saving Time year round, if signed by Governor Rick Scott, Congress would need to amend existing federal law to allow the change.
