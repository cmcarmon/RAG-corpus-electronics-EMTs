The design of fiber optic systems depends on how much light is launched into an optical fiber from
an optical source and how much light is coupled between fiber optic components, such as from one fiber
to another. The amount of power launched from a source into a fiber depends on the optical properties of
both the source and the fiber. The amount of optical power launched into an optical fiber depends on the
radiance of the optical source. An optical source's radiance, or brightness, is a measure of its optical
power launching capability. Radiance is the amount of optical power emitted in a specific direction per
unit time by a unit area of emitting surface. For most types of optical sources, only a fraction of the power
emitted by the source is launched into the optical fiber.
