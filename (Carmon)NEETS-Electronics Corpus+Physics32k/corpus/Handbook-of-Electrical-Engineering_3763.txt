These  modes  are  portrayed  in  Fig.  37.2.  The  sky  wave  is  directed  toward  the  ionosphere,  which  bends  the
propagation  path  back  toward  the  earth  under  certain  conditions  in  a  limited  frequency  range  (0–50  MHz
approximately). The surface wave is directed along the surface over which the wave is propagated. The space
wave  consists  of  the  direct  wave  and  the  reﬂected  wave.  The  direct  wave  travels  from  the  transmitter  to  the
receiver in nearly a straight path, while the reﬂected wave is due to ground reﬂection. The space wave obeys
the optical laws in that direct and reﬂected wave components contribute to the total wave. Although the sky
and surface waves are important in many applications, we will only consider space waves in this section.
