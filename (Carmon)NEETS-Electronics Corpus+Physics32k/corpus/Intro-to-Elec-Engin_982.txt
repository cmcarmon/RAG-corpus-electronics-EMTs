Alignment
Pieces of highly permeable material, such as iron, situated in ambient medium of low permeability,
such as air, in which a magnetic ﬁeld is established, experience mechanical forces that tend to
align them with the ﬁeld direction in such a way that the reluctance of the system is minimized (or
the inductance of the system is maximized). Figure 12.1.6 illustrates this principle of alignment
