Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, we can now step around each of these loops, generating
equations representative of the component voltage drops and polarities. As with the Branch
Current method, we will denote a resistor’s voltage drop as the product of the resistance (in
ohms) and its respective mesh current (that quantity being unknown at this point). Where two
currents mesh together, we will write that term in the equation with resistor current being the
sum of the two meshing currents.
