(cid:181) is the attenuation constant of the medium and the factor 2 is for a two-way path.
Ls = signal-processing losses that occur for virtually every waveform and implementation.
dT = the radar cross-sectional area of the object that is being detected.
k = Boltzmann’s constant (1.38210–23 W-s/K).
Ts = system noise temperature.
b = Doppler ﬁlter or speedgate bandwidth.
