6.1 Information Communication1
As far as a communications engineer is concerned, signals express information. Because systems manipulate
signals, they also aﬀect the information content. Information comes neatly packaged in both analog and
digital forms. Speech, for example, is clearly an analog signal, and computer ﬁles consist of a sequence
of bytes, a form of “discrete-time” signal despite the fact that the index sequences byte position, not time
sample. Communication systems endeavor not to manipulate information, but to transmit it from one
place to another, so-called point-to-point communication, from one place to many others, broadcast
communication, or from many to many, like a telephone conference call or a chat room. Communication
systems can be fundamentally analog, like radio, or digital, like computer networks.
