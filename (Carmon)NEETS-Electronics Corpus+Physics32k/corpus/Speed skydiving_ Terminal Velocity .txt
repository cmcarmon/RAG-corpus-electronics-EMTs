The terminal velocity of a falling body occurs during free fall when the force due to gravity is exactly balanced by the force due to air resistance, such that the body experiences zero acceleration. The formula for terminal velocity (where buoyancy in air is negligible) is given by the thrust

{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {t} }={\sqrt {\frac {2mg}{\rho AC_{\mathrm {d} }}}}}

where
m is the mass of the falling object
g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2)
Cd is the drag coefficient (~0.7 for head down position, ~1 for belly-to-earth position)
ρ is the density of the fluid through which the object is falling (1,23 kg/m3 for air at sea level, and ~0.99 kg/m3 at the middle of the measurement zone (2200m))
A is the projected area of the object, or area cross-section (~0.18 m2 for head down position, ~0.7 for belly-to-earth position)
So, for a human in belly-to-earth position (A = 0.7 m2, m = 90 kg, Cd = 1) this gives 50.6 m/s, about the terminal velocity of the typical skydiver of 55 m/s.
The skydiver cannot increase their mass easily enough to significantly increase terminal velocity, and the skydiver's area cross-section is limited by their helmet and shoulders in a head-down dive position. The most significant difference comes from the skydiver reducing their coefficient of friction. The head-down body position has to be carefully managed to be as streamlined as possible, while special helmets and slick body suits reduce skin friction, which is a function of surface area and texture. The shape and rigidity of the suits also have to be designed to minimize the coefficient of drag. Finally, a skydiver must reach their maximum speed at as high an altitude as possible so that the density of air is at a minimum.
