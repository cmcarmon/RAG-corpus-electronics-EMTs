A satellite repeater receives uplink signals (U), translates them to a downlink frequency band (D), channel-
izes, ampliÔ¨Åes to high power, and retransmits to earth. Multiple beams allow reuse of the available band. Interference (dashed
lines) can limit performance. Downconversion may also occur after the input multiplexers. Several intermediate frequencies
and downconversions may be used.
