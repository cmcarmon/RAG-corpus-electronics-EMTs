Frequency Domain Coders
Coders  that  rely  on  spectral  decomposition  often  use  the  usual  set  of  sinusoidal  basis  functions  from  signal
theory to represent the speciﬁc short-time spectral content of a segment of speech. In this case, the approximated
signal consists of a linear combination of sinusoids with speciﬁed amplitudes and arguments (frequency, phase).
For compactness, a countable subset of harmonically related sinusoids may be used. The two most prominent
types of frequency domain coders are subband coders and multi-band coders.
