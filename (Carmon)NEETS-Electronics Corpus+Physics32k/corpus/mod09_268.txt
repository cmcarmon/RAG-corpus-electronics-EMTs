Refer to figure 2-10, view (D), for the following discussion of the circuit operation of the Armstrong 
oscillator. When VCC is applied to the circuit. a small amount of base current flows through R2 which sets 
the forward bias on Q1. This forward bias causes collector current to flow from ground through Q1, R1, 
and L1 to +VCC. The current through L1 develops a magnetic field which induces a voltage into the tank 
circuit. The voltage is positive at the top of L2 and C1. At this time, two actions occur. First, resonant 
tank capacitor C1 charges to this voltage; the tank circuit now has stored energy. Second, coupling 
capacitor C2 couples the positive signal to the base of Q1. With a positive signal on its base, Q1 conducts 
harder. With Q1 conducting harder, more current flows through L1, a larger voltage is induced into L2, 
and a larger positive signal is coupled back to the base of Q1. While this is taking place, the frequency-
determining device is storing more energy and C1 is charging to the voltage induced into L2.
