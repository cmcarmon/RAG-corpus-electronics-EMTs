Where junctions or interfaces of any sort exist, there will always be distributed capacitances associated with
them,  and  to  make  these  easy  to  handle  analytically,  they  may  be “lumped”  into  single  capacitances.  In  the
present context, two lumped capacitances have been incorporated into the hybrid-p model, Cb¢e from base to
emitter and Cb9c from base to collector, respectively. These now complete the model, and it will be appreciated
that they make it possible to analyze high-frequency performance. Typically, Cb¢e will be a few picofarads and
will always be larger than Cb9c .
