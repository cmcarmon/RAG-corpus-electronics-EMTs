components fast enough. In addition, the data processing
components must work fast enough. However, the two can
be cleanly separated. Most of the transfers can take place
during the processing of other data; there may be a small
amount of processing or a small amount of transfers that
cannot be overlapped, but between these, there is a broad
range of exploration, as indicated in Subsection 2.5.2.
