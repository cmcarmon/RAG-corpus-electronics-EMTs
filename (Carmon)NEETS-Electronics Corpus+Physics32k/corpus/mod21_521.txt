Figure 5-26 shows the earlier type of test setup, which is still an option. However, today's time-
domain reflectometers have several advantages over the old pulse-generator and oscilloscope methods.

options for field use, and provide a direct readout of distances instead of time. Some equipments provide 
a paper-tape recording for a permanent record. Figure 5-27 shows a typical time-domain reflectometer.
