Generalized impedance convertors (GIC) are electronic circuits used to convert one impedance into another
impedance [Bruton, 1981; Van Valkenburg, 1982]. GICs provide a way to get the advantages of passive circuits
without the disadvantages of inductors. Figure 29.23 illustrates the application of a GIC. The GIC converts the
impedance Z2(s) to the impedance Z1(s). The impedances are related by
