Again, thinking of a physical system, the system’s connection
structure can be held ﬁxed while the types of system compo-
nents or their values change. Experience explains that for each
distinct set of components or component values, a unique
input/output relation is determined. From a mathematical
perspective, a given connection description determines a map-
ping of the internal component parameters to the input/
output relation.
