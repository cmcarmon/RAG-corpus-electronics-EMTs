The typical bwo is constructed from a folded transmission line or waveguide that winds back and 
forth across the path of the electron beam, as shown in figure 2-16. The folded waveguide in the 
illustration serves the same purpose as the helix in a twt. The fixed spacing of the folded waveguide limits 
the bandwidth of the bwo. Since the frequency of a given waveguide is constant, the frequency of the bwo 
is controlled by the transit time of the electron beam. The transit time is controlled by the collector 
potential. Thus, the output frequency can be changed by varying the collector voltage, which is a definite 
advantage. As in the twt, the electron beam in the bwo is focused by a magnet placed around the body of 
the tube.
