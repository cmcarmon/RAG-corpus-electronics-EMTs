The opportunity for promote or give a position that obviously capitalises on personal skills in one's career is an important characteristic in occupational environment. In essence, the progression of career is grown from bottom up in an employment hierarchy. However, there are also other forms of career development, involving indirect work movement, shifts to another roles.
The option for moving or shifting to alternative roles motivates the employee's participation in the workplace meaning if employee can see the future potential for a promotion, motivation levels will increase. By contrast, if an organisation does not provide any potential for higher status position in the future, the employee's effectiveness in work will decrease. In addition, the employee may consider whether or not the position would be offer to them in the future. On the other hand, not all of the opportunities for transferring into another activity are aimed to obtain the upward movement. In some cases, they are aimed to prevent the skills obsolescence, provides more future career possibility, as well as directly increasing the skill development.
