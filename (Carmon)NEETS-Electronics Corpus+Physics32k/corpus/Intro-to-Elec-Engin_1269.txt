13.4.13 A 7.5-hp, 250-V, 1800-r/min shunt motor, having
a full-load line current of 26 A, is started with a
four-point starter. The resistance of the armature
circuit, including the interpole winding, is 0.48
; and the resistance of the shunt-ﬁeld circuit,
including the ﬁeld rheostat, is 350 . The resis-
tances of the steps in the starting resistor are 2.24,
1.47, 0.95, 0.62, 0.40, and 0.26 , in the order
in which they are successively cut out. When the
armature current is dropped to its rated value,
the starting box is switched to the next point,
thus eliminating a step in the starting resistance.
Neglecting ﬁeld-current changes, armature reac-
tion, and armature inductance, ﬁnd the initial and
ﬁnal values of the armature current and speed
corresponding to each step.
