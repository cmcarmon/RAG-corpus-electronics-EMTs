Practical amplifier circuits 
 
The simple common-emitter amplifier stage shown 
in Fig. 7.38 provides a modest voltage gain (80 to 
120 
resistance  of 
approximately  1.5  kP and  an  output  resistance  of 
around  20  kP. The  frequency  response  extends 
from a few hertz to several hundred kilohertz. The 
improved arrangement shown in Fig. 7.38 provides 
a voltage gain of around 150 to 200 by eliminating 
the signal frequency negative feedback that occurs 
through R1 in Fig. 7.39.
