The ideal situation is to have no reactance in the circuit. This is accomplished by adding capacitive 
reactance to a circuit which is inductive and inductive reactance to a circuit which is capacitive. For 
example, the circuit shown in figure 4-10 has a total reactance of 80 ohms capacitive and the power factor 
was .6 or 60 percent. If 80 ohms of inductive reactance were added to this circuit (by adding another 
inductor) the circuit would have a total reactance of zero ohms and a power factor of 1 or 100 percent. 
The apparent and true power of this circuit would then be equal.
