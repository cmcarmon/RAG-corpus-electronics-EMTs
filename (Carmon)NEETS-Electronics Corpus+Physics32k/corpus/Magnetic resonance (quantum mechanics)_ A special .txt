A special case occurs where a system oscillates between two unstable levels that have the same life time



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
. If atoms are excited at a constant, say n/time, to the first state, some decay and the rest have a probability




P

12




{\displaystyle P_{12}}
to transition to the second state, so in the time interval between t and (t+dt) the number of atoms that jump to the second state from the first is

P

d

{\displaystyle n(1-e^{-t/\tau })P_{12}dt}
, so at time t the number of atoms in the second state is

The rate of decay from state two depends on the number of atoms that were collected in that state from all previous intervals, so the number of atoms in state 2 is

; The rate of decay of atoms from state two is proportional to the number of atoms present in that state, while the constant of proportionality is decay constant

{\displaystyle \lambda }
. Performing the integration rate of decay of atoms from state two is obtained as:
