A cross section through a circular drift detector is shown in Fig. 116.19. The electron collecting anode ring
surrounds the integrated FET used for the ﬁrst stage of signal ampliﬁcation. Enough negative bias is applied
to the back contact (actually the entrance window) to deplete the wafer to the anode, which is near ground
potential. At the same time, negative bias progressively increasing in magnitude is applied from the ring next
to the anode (near ground potential) to the outermost ring, which is maintained at about two times the bias
of the back contact. These applied biases deplete the detector in such a way that there is an electrostatic potential
minimum for electrons that varies in depth across the detector from right under the front surface at the anode
to near the back contact at the last ring. Ionized electrons will drift ﬁrst to this minimum, then drift radially
to the anode as shown in Fig. 116.19. A feature of this contacting arrangement is that the anode capacitance,
