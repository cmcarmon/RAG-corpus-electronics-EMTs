The condition-code register is an 8-bit regis-
ter that allows a programmer to check the status of 
the microprocessor at a certain point in a program. 
Depending on the microprocessor, the name of the 
condition-code register may be the processor-status 
register, the P-register, the status register, or the flag 
register. An individual bit in the condition-code reg-
ister is called a flag bit. The most common flags are 
carry, zero, and sign. The carry flag is used during an 
arithmetic operation to determine whether there is a 
carry or a borrow. The zero flag is used to determine 
whether the results of an instruction are all zeros. 
The sign flag is used to indicate whether a number is 
positive or negative. Of the 8 bits in the code register, 
the Motorola 6800 and the Zilog Z80 use 6 bits; the 
Intel 8080A uses 5; and the MOS Technology 6502 
uses 7.
