The terminating resistor plays an important part in the operation of the rhombic antenna. Upon it 
depend the unidirectivity of the antenna and the lack of resonance effects. An antenna should be properly 
terminated so it will have a constant impedance at its input. Terminating the antenna properly will also 
allow it to be operated over a wide frequency range without the necessity for changing the coupling 
adjustments at the transmitter. Discrimination against signals coming from the rear is of great importance
