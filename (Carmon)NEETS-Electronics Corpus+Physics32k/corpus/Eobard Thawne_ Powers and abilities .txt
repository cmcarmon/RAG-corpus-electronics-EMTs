Even prior to gaining his metahuman abilities, Eobard Thawne already possessed genius-level intellect by the standards of the 25th Century. In The Flash: Rebirth, it is discovered that when he duplicated the accident that gave Barry Allen his powers, he created a negative Speed Force by corrupting the positive version of it. The Reverse-Flash is therefore able to travel at superhuman speeds faster than the speed of light, deliver blows of extreme force, run on water, generate vacuums, create after-images ("speed mirages") of himself, and vibrate his molecules to pass through solid objects. Unlike users of the original Speed Force, Thawne has the ability to travel through and manipulate time, being able to drastically alter history and completely erase people from existence (other speedsters cannot change the past without dramatic consequences). Thawne developed numerous new powers in the events leading up to Flashpoint, including the ability to cross over to other dimensions, create shockwaves across time and space at the snap of his fingers, absorb another's memories via physical contact, and alter the age of anyone or anything. Thawne has also displayed low levels of superhuman strength, as well as electrokinetic abilities. The presence of his lightning is able to disrupt and fry nearby electronics, in addition to allowing him to manipulate magnetism.
During the New 52 reboot, Thawne gained the ability to slow down time. He retained his pre-New 52 counterpart's age altering abilities. In the DC Rebirth relaunch, however, Thawne regained his connection to the negative Speed Force and therefore all of his original powers.
