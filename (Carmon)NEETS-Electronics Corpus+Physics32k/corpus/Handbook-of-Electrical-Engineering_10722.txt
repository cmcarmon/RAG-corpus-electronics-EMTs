GPS is adequate for automotive navigation except in high-rise cities, in tunnels, and on streets with heavy
foliage. To ﬁll coverage gaps, map-matching software can take advantage of the fact that the vehicle remains
on roads. On the highway, dead-reckoning or GPS errors can be rectiﬁed to the nearest road. In cities, turns
can be correlated with the nearest intersection of matching geometry. An accuracy of several meters is possible
if all streets are included on the stored map (e.g., alleys, driveways, and parking garages).
