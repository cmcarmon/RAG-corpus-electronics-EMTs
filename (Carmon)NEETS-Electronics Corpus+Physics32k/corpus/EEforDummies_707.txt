Manufacturers can build digital integrated cir-
cuits in many ways. A single gate can be con-
structed using a resistor and a transistor, or just 
bipolar transistors, or just MOSFETs (another 
kind  of  transistor),  or  other  combinations  of 
components. Certain design approaches make 
it easier to cram lots of tiny gates together in 
a chip, while other design approaches result in 
faster circuits or lower power consumption.
Every digital IC is classified according to the 
design approach and the processing technol-
ogy used to build its tiny circuits. These clas-
sifications are called logic families. There are 
literally  dozens  of  logic  families,  but  the  two 
most famous families are TTL and CMOS.
TTL, or transistor‐transistor logic, uses bipolar 
transistors to construct both gates and ampli-
fiers. Manufacturing TTL ICs is relatively inex-
pensive, but they generally draw a lot of power 
and  require  a  specific  (5‐volt)  power  supply. 
Several branches in the TTL family, notably the 
Low‐Power Schottky series, draw roughly one‐
fifth the power of conventional TTL technology. 
Most  TTL  ICs  use  the  74xx  and  74xxx  format
