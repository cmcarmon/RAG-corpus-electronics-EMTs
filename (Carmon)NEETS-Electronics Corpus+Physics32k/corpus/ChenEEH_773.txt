2. In-place data mapping: Note that ac_inter‘ has a
dependency only on two of its earlier values; thus
only three (earlier) integer values need to be stored
for computing each of
the autocorrelated values.
Thus, by performing intrasignal in-place data map-
ping, as shown in Figure 2.26, we are able to drastically
reduce the size of this signal from 26,400 to 33 integer
elements. The signal AutoCorr‘ is a temporary signal.
By reusing the memory space of signal ac_inter‘ for
storing AutoCorr‘, we can further reduce the total
memory space required. This is achieved by intersignal
in-place mapping of array AutoCorr‘ on ac_inter‘.
Thus, initially ac_inter‘ could not have been accom-
modated in the on-chip local memory due to the large
size of this signal, but now we have removed this
