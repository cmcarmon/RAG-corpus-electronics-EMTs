for  transformers  include  stepping-up  or  stepping-
down  mains  voltages  in  power  supplies,  coupling 
signals  in  AF  amplifiers  to  achieve  impedance 
matching  and  to  isolate  d.c.  potentials  associated 
with active components.  
  The electrical characteristics of a transformer are 
determined  by  a  number  of  factors  including  the 
core  material  and  physical  dimensions.  The 
specifications for a transformer usually include the 
rated  primary  and  secondary  voltages  and  current 
the required power rating (i.e. the maximum power, 
usually expressed in volt-amperes, VA) which can 
be continuously delivered by the transformer under 
a given  set  of  conditions,  the  frequency  range  for 
the  component  (usually  stated  as  upper  and  lower
