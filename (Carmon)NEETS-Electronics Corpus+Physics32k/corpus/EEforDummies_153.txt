The diagram in Figure 3-6 depicts a battery‐operated circuit that powers a 
light‐emitting diode (LED), much like what you might find in a mini LED flash-
light. What you see in the figure is a circuit diagram, or schematic, that shows 
all the components of the circuit and how they are connected. (I discuss 
schematics in detail in Chapter 14.)
