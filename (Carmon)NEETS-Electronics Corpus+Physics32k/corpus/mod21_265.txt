Testing techniques and the principles of measurement for fiber-optic and conventional cable are
similar. For example, if both ends of the cable are exposed and can be used for testing, relatively
unsophisticated equipment can be used to measure cable parameters, such as continuity and attenuation.
This includes equipment such as optical multimeters and optical power meters (OPM). If only one cable
end is available, then more sophisticated equipment such as an optical time-domain reflectometer
(OTDR), is used. The following section lists and defines some common optical test equipment.
