p r o b l e m 15.18 This problem deals with switched-capacitor circuits introduced
in Problem 15.15. Referring to Figure 15.84, assume both S1 switches are closed for
time 1/2f0 with S2 open, and S2 closed for 1/2f0 with s1 open. Assume no overlap, that
is, and S1 and S2 switches are never both closed at the same time.
