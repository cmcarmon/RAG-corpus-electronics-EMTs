A pressuremeter is a meter constructed to measure the “at-rest horizontal earth pressure”. The pressuremeter has two major components. The first component is a read-out unit that remains above ground. The second component of the pressure meter is a probe that is inserted into the borehole (ground) to read the pressure.
