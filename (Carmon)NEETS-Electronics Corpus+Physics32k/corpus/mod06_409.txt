particles with a designated vacuum cleaner, using an approved disposal collection bag. If a
vacuum cleaner is not designated, use a wet cloth to wipe the affected area. In this case, be sure to
make one stroke at a time. DO NOT use a back-and-forth motion. After each stroke, fold the cloth
in half, always holding one clean side and using the other for the new stroke. Dispose of the cloth
in the manner stated in instruction 14 below.
