The a3, b3, and c3 are the 3-D version a, b, and c, respectively. &
From this example, a three-level nested Do-loop algorithm
can be written in a single assignment format and a perfect loop
nest. The innermost loop body is composed of a set of input/
propagation, computing/initialization, and output statements
as shown in Figure 7.1. We denote J n as the computing index
space.
