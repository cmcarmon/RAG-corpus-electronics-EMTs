In non-relativistic physics there is a unique and well defined notion of the center of mass vector, a three-dimensional vector (abbreviated: "3-vector"), of an isolated system of massive particles inside the 3-spaces of inertial frames of Galilei spacetime. However, no such notion exists in special relativity inside the 3-spaces of the inertial frames of Minkowski spacetime.

{\displaystyle x^{\mu }=(x^{0},x)}
a collective variable with all the properties of the Newton center of mass does not exist. The primary properties of the non-relativistic center of mass are
i) together with the total momentum it forms a canonical pair,
ii) it transforms under rotations as a three vector, and
iii) it is a position associated with the spatial mass distribution of the constituents.
It is interesting that the following three proposals for a relativistic center of mass appearing in the literature of the last century  take on individually these three properties:
The Newton–Wigner–Pryce center of spin or canonical center of mass, (it is the classical counterpart of the Newton–Wigner quantum position operator). It is a 3-vector

{\displaystyle {\tilde {x}}^{\mu }=({\tilde {x}}^{o},{\vec {\tilde {x}}})}
having it as the space part, so that it does not identify a worldline, but only a pseudo-worldline, depending on the chosen inertial frame.

, neither the space part of a 4-vector, i.e. it only identifies a frame-dependent pseudo-worldline. These three collective variables have all the same constant 3-velocity and all of them collapse into the Newton center of mass in the non-relativistic limit. In the 1970s there was a big debate on this problem, without any final conclusion.
