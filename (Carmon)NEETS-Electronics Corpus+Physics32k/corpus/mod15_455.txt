SERVO AMPLIFIERâ€”An ac or dc amplifier used in servo systems to build up signal strength.
These amplifiers usually have relatively flat gain versus frequency response, minimum phase
shift, low output impedance, and low noise level. The dc amplifier is subject to excessive
drift and is relatively unstable. However, the ac amplifier is considered drift free and has a
constant dynamic gain over a variety of operating points.
