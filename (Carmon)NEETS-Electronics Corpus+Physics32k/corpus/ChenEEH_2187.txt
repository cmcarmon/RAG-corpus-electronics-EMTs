simple formulas for inductance. This is only possible for in-
ductors with high degrees of symmetry, such as the toroid or
inÔ¨Ånitely long coaxial cable shown in Table 1.6. Alternatively,
numerical integration can be used instead to evaluate equa-
tions 1.96 and 1.97; the latter is particularly suited for coil-type
inductors (Whites, 1998, Example 4.15).
