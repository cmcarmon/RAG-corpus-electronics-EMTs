	
A	pair	of	loudspeakers	is	an	example	of	an	electronic	device	that	works	due	to	the
strategic	positioning	of	circuit	elements.	That,	along	with	the	integral	parts	called
electromagnets;	such	components	cause	disturbance	to	other	circuit	elements.	Their	effect
on	their	fellows	is	rather	significant	as	they	tend	to	make	the	device’s	cone	to	vibrate.	As	a
result,	sound,	and	in	most	cases,	high	quality	sound,	is	produced.
For	a	deeper	understanding	of	a	loudspeaker,	you	could	use	a	lesson	in	electromagnetism.
