The massless leg assumption in the inverted pendulum theory omits the amount of work required to swing the contralateral leg during single support. Due to the similarity of leg swing with the hanging pendulum paradigm, the work performed is dominated by gravity. In the case that the leg is swung at a rate outside of the natural frequency, the hip torque generated by muscle action becomes significantly larger. For typical steady gait, it is approximated that the energy expended to perform leg swing accounts for 10% to 30% of the total metabolic energy consumed.
