What should the student conclude about the network from these results? Support your
conclusion with plots of the network v i characteristics.

a) Devise an electrical circuit of voltage sources and resistors that will ‘‘calculate’’ the
balance point (center of mass) of the massless bar shown in Figure 3.142, for three
arbitrary masses hung at three arbitrary places along the bar. We want the circuit to
generate a voltage that is proportional to the position of the balance point. Write
the equation for your network, and show that it performs the required calculation.
(Work with conductances and superposition for a simple solution.)
