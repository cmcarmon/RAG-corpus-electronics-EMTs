Let us now examine the operation of the circuit shown in Figure 9.36
more closely. Once the current source steps its value to Iâ—¦, it begins to deliver
charge to the capacitor at that constant rate. The charge then accumulates
linearly in the capacitor, much like water would accumulate in a glass from a
faucet set to deliver that water at a constant rate. Since charge and voltage are
proportional through the constant capacitance C of the linear time-invariant
capacitor, the voltage across the capacitor also increases linearly. This is as
shown in Figure 9.37.
