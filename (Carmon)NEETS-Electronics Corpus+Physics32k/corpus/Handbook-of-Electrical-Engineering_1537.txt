Humans recognize words based not only on what they hear, but also on what they have heard in the past, as
well  as  what  they  anticipate  to  hear  in  the  future.  It  is  this  capability  that  make  humans  the  best  speech
recognition  systems.  Modern  speech  recognition  systems  attempt  to  achieve  this  human  capability  through
language  modeling.  Language  modeling  is  the  art  and  science  of  anticipating  or  predicting  words  or  word
sequences from nonacoustic sources of information such as context, structure, and grammar of the particular
language, previously heard word sequences.
