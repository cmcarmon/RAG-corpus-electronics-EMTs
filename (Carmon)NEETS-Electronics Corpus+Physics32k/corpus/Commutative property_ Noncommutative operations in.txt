Concatenation, the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation. For example,




E
A
+
T
=
E
A
T
≠
T
E
A
=
T
+
E

{\displaystyle EA+T=EAT\neq TEA=T+EA}

Washing and drying clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying produces a markedly different result to drying and then washing.
Rotating a book 90° around a vertical axis then 90° around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation than when the rotations are performed in the opposite order.
The twists of the Rubik's Cube are noncommutative. This can be studied using group theory.
Thought processes are noncommutative: A person asked a question (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.
