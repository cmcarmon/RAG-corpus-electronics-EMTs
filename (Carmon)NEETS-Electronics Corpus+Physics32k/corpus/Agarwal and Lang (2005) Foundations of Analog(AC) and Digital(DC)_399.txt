To verify that energy is conserved in the circuit, we must show that the power dissipated
by the elements is equal to the power supplied. Since the input side current is zero, there
is no power dissipated or supplied at the input side. At the output side, the power
dissipated in the 3-k resistor is given by
3 k Ã— i2
