same point. For (ˆSi /Ni )PCM = 32 at the sampler,
ﬁnd Pe for a unipolar and a polar system. In which
system will the bit errors occur more frequently?
15.3.15 For a Manchester PCM system, expressions for Eb
and Pe are given in Problems 15.3.13 and 15.3.14.
Determine:
(a) The minimum value of (ˆSi /Ni )PCM that is
