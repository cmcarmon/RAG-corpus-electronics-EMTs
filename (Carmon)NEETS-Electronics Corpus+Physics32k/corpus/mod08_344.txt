The schematic symbols for an operational amplifier are shown in figure 3-10. View (A) shows the
power supply requirements while view (B) shows only the input and output terminals. An operational
amplifier is a special type of high-gain, d.c. amplifier. To be classified as an operational amplifier, the
circuit must have certain characteristics. The three most important characteristics of an operational
amplifier are:
