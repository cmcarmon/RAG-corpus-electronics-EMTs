of  the  cathode  surface,  impurities  in  the  conducting  channel,  and  generation  and  recombination  noise  in
transistors.  In  the  early  days  of  transistors,  this  generation-recombination  was  of  great  concern  because  the
materials were not of high purity. Flicker noise occurs in thin layers of metallic or semiconducting material,
solid state devices, carbon resistors, and vacuum tubes [see Buckingham, 1985, p. 143]. It includes contact noise
because it is caused by ï¬‚uctuating conductivity due to imperfect contact between two surfaces, especially in
switches and relays. Flicker noise may be high at low frequencies.
