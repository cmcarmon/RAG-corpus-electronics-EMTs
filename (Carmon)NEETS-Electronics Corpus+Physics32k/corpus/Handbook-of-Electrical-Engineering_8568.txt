Controllers
Real-time controllers beneÔ¨Åt from a microprogrammed implementation, due to the speed gained by program-
ming only the required functions, therefore avoiding the overhead of general-purpose instructions. Since the
microprogrammer  can  better  make  use  of  the  available  parallelism  in  the  machine,  long  processes  can  still
support the asynchronous arrival of data by incorporating the interrupt polling at intervals in these processes.
