When you’re shopping around for parts, you may see the term RoHS compliant 
next to some of the parts. The term RoHS (pronounced “ROW‐haas”) refers 
to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive adopted in 2003 by the 
European Union (E.U.). The RoHS directive, which took effect in 2006, restricts 
the placement on the E.U. market of new electrical and electronic devices 
that contain more than a specified level of lead and five other hazardous sub-
stances. Companies producing consumer and industrial electronics need to 
worry about RoHS compliance if they want to sell products in E.U. countries 
(and China, which has its own RoHS specification), but if you are just tinkering 
around with electronics in your house, you need not worry about using lead‐
free solder and other RoHS‐compliant parts. Just don’t let your cat munch on 
your solder.
