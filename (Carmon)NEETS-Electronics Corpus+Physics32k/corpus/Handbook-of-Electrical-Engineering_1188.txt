When the attribute sets Ck are each closed spaces, it follows that their intersection gives rise to a composite
attribute  set  C  which  is  also  a  closed  subspace.  The  above  theorem  indicates  that  the  solution  to  the  signal
restoration problem (14.73) is unique. It will be useful to interpret this solution from an algebraic viewpoint.
