A micrometer is composed of:
Frame
The C-shaped body that holds the anvil and barrel in constant relation to each other. It is thick because it needs to minimize flexion, expansion, and contraction, which would distort the measurement.
The frame is heavy and consequently has a high thermal mass, to prevent substantial heating up by the holding hand/fingers. It is often covered by insulating plastic plates which further reduce heat transference.
Explanation: if one holds the frame long enough so that it heats up by 10 °C, then the increase in length of any 10 cm linear piece of steel is of magnitude 1/100 mm. For micrometers this is their typical accuracy range.
Micrometers typically have a specified temperature at which the measurement is correct (often 20 °C [68 °F], which is generally considered "room temperature" in a room with HVAC). Toolrooms are generally kept at 20 °C [68 °F].
Anvil
The shiny part that the spindle moves toward, and that the sample rests against.
Sleeve / barrel / stock
The stationary round component with the linear scale on it, sometimes with vernier markings. In some instruments the scale is marked on a tight-fitting but movable cylindrical sleeve fitting over the internal fixed barrel. This allows zeroing to be done by slightly altering the position of the sleeve.
Lock nut / lock-ring / thimble lock
The knurled component (or lever) that one can tighten to hold the spindle stationary, such as when momentarily holding a measurement.
Screw
(not seen) The heart of the micrometer, as explained under "Operating principles". It is inside the barrel. This references the fact that the usual name for the device in German is Messschraube, literally "measuring screw".
Spindle
The shiny cylindrical component that the thimble causes to move toward the anvil.
Thimble
The component that one's thumb turns. Graduated markings.
Ratchet stop
(not shown in illustration) Device on end of handle that limits applied pressure by slipping at a calibrated torque.
