A second generation of SuperCDMS is planned for SNOLAB. This is expanded from SuperCDMS Soudan in every way:
The individual detector discs are 100 mm/3.9″ diameter × 33.3 mm/1.3″ thick, 225% the volume of the 76.2 mm/3″ diameter × 25.4 mm/1″ thick discs in Soudan.
There are more of them, with room for 31 "towers" of six discs each, although operation will begin with only four towers.
The detector is better shielded, by both its deeper location in SNOLAB, and greater attention to radiopurity in construction.:18
The increase in detector mass is not quite as large, because about 25% of the detectors will be made of silicon,:7 which only weights 44% as much.:1 Filling all 31 towers at this ratio would result in about 222 kg
Although the project has suffered repeated delays (earlier plans hoped for construction to begin in 2014 and 2016), it remains active, with space allocated in SNOLAB and a scheduled construction start in early 2018.:9.
