SPICE begins with a reiteration of the netlist, complete with title line and .end statement.
About halfway through the simulation it displays the voltage at all nodes with reference to
node 0. In this example, we only have one node other than node 0, so it displays the voltage
there: 10.0000 volts. Then it displays the current through each voltage source. Since we only
have one voltage source in the entire circuit, it only displays the current through that one. In
this case, the source current is 2 amps. Due to a quirk in the way SPICE analyzes current, the
