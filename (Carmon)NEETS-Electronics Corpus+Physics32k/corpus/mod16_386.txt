The electrodynamometer-type meter differs from the galvanometer types we have just studied in that
two fixed coils are used to produce the magnetic field instead of a permanent magnet. Two movable coils
are also used in the electrodynamometer meter. The electrodynamometer meter is most commonly found
in various types of power meters.
