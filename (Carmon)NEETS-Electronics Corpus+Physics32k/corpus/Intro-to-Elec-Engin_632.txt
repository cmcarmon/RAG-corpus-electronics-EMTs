The physical operation of the junction can be described in terms of the charge-ï¬‚ow processes.
Usually there is a greater concentration of holes in the p-region than in the n-region; similarly,
the electron concentration in the n-region is greater than that in the p-region. The differences in
concentration establish a potential gradient across the junction, resulting in a diffusion of carriers,
as indicated in Figure 7.2.2(a). Holes diffuse from the p-region to the n-region, electrons from
the n-region to the p-region. The result of the diffusion is to produce immobile ions of opposite
charge on each side of the junction, as shown in Figure 7.2.2(b), and cause a depletion region (or
space-charge region) in which no mobile carriers exist.
