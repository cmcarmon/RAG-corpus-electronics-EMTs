If several users can access the same computer, the system
needs to provide a means for users to protect the privacy of
their ﬁles. In many systems, a user can specify the type of
protection, such as read, write, and execution, against certain
groups of users. Before a ﬁle can be read or written, it must be
opened, at which time the protection is checked. If the access is
permitted, the system returns a small integer called a ﬁle
descriptor or handle to use in subsequent operations. Other-
wise, an error code is returned.
