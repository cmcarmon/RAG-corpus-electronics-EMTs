The ﬁrst stage, the ﬁlter bank, has the following requirements. First, decomposing and then simply recon-
structing  the  signal  should  not  lead  to  distortions  (“perfect  reconstruction  ﬁlterbank”).  This  results  in  the
advantage that all distortions are due to the quantization of the spectral data. Since each quantizer works on
band-limited  data,  the  distortion  (also  band-limited  due  to  reﬁltering)  is  controllable  by  using  the  masking
models described above. Second, the bandwidths of the ﬁlters should be narrow to provide sufﬁcient coding
gain.  On  the  other  hand,  the  length  of  the  impulse  responses  of  the  ﬁlters  should  be  short  enough  (time
resolution of the coder!) to avoid so-called pre-echoes, that is, backward spreading of distortion components
