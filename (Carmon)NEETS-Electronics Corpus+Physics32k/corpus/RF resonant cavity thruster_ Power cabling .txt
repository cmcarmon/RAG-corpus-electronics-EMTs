Another source of error was a Lorentz force arising from power leads. In order to eliminate interference from cable forces, many tests have made use of Galinstan liquid metal screws to minimize such forces. However error sources can still arise from magnetic damping. Martin Tajmar in his experiment at Dresden University of Technology ran dummy tests on their experimental setup, and found magnetic interaction with power cables to be the most significant source of noise. When he replaced the galinstan liquid metal damping with oil fluid damping, and ran the experiment again, the only thrust they observed was well within the range of experimental error. White's power setup may have been different; but their paper does not state if the connections are all coaxially aligned with the standâ€™s rotation axis, which would be required to minimize errors from Lorentz forces, and it gives no data from equivalent tests with power into a dummy load so these influences can be compared with those seen in the test run.
