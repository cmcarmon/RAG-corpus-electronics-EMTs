In practical devices, the work function of the metal, fm, is not
equal to that of the semiconductor, fs. Consider a MOS
capacitor with fm < fs at zero gate bias (gate connected to
the substrate). Electrons in the metal reside at energy levels
above the conduction band of the semiconductor. As a result,
electrons ï¬‚ow from the metal into the semiconductor until
a potential that counterbalances the difference in the work
functions is built up between the two plates. This induces a
negative charge under the gate dielectric accompanied by a
downward band bending and, hence, a positive surface poten-
tial.
