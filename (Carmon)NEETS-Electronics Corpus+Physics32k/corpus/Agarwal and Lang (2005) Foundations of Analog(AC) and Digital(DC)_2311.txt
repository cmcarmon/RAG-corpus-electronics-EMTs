This appendix briefly reviews the three trigonometric functions cos(θ), sin(θ),
and tan(θ), and various identities involving them. These functions are often
encountered during the analysis of transients in second-order linear circuits,
and during the analysis of any linear circuit in sinusoidal steady state.
