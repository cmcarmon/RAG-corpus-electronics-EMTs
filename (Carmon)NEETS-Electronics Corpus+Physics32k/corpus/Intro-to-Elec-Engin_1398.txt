with no effect on voltages and currents anywhere else on the line. This result is very signiﬁcant,
because if a wave is launched on a real, ﬁnite-length transmission line, the wave will dissipate
itself in the terminating load impedance if that impedance is equal to the line’s characteristic
impedance. The load is then said to be matched to the line. In Figure 15.1.3, the source and
load resistances are shown matched so that RS = R0 = RL. Otherwise, a mismatch at the load
(RL (cid:2)= R0) reﬂects some of the signal energy back toward the source where any mismatch (RS (cid:2)=
R0) further reﬂects energy in the forward direction. Impedance matching on both ends eliminates
these undesired multiple reﬂections. Note that the value of R0 will be different for different types
of transmission lines.
