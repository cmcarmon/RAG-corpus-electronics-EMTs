The terms unit and number when used with the decimal system are almost self-explanatory. By
definition the unit is a single object; that is, an apple, a dollar, a day. A number is a symbol representing a
unit or a quantity. The figures 0, 1, 2, and 3 through 9 are the symbols used in the decimal system. These
symbols are called Arabic numerals or figures. Other symbols may be used for different number systems.
For example, the symbols used with the Roman numeral system are letters Â¾ V is the symbol for 5, X for
10, M for 1,000, and so forth. We will use Arabic numerals and letters in the number system discussions
in this chapter.
