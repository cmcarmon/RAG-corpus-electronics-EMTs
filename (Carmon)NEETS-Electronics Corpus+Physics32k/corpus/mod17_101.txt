SHIP-TO-SHORE.â€”This application of the hf band is more difficult than point-to-point since the 
ship is moving and constantly changing its position. In ship-to-shore the path length and direction are 
variable. Aboard ship, limited space and other restrictions prohibit installation of large, efficient hf 
antennas. Because of the mobility of ships, shipboard antennas are designed to be as nearly 
omnidirectional as possible.
