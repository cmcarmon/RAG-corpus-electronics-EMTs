Fast Decoupled Power Flow Algorithm
Both the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and the Newton-Raphson
algorithm are general methods for solving linear and nonlinear
equations respectively, and they were tailored toward solving
the power ﬂow problem. On the other hand, we study a
speciﬁc method for power systems in this section called the
fast decoupled power ﬂow algorithm, which is a heuristic
method that is derived by exploiting speciﬁc properties for a
power system.
