OpenSim 1.0 was released on August 20, 2007 and provided capabilities for viewing musculoskeletal models, importing models developed in SIMM (Musculographics Inc.), editing muscle paths, and generating muscle actuated simulations that track experimental data.
OpenSim 1.1 was released on December 11, 2007, which added new features such as user-specified camera positions for recording movies of simulations, and a perturbation (sensitivity) analysis for inquiry into the function of individual muscles.
OpenSim 2.2.1 was released on April 11, 2011. This software update enhanced the user interface and allowed the user to set bounds on activations of muscles and actuators relating to static optimization not dynamic optimization.
OpenSim 2.4 was released on October 10, 2011. This newest and most recent update includes faster and more robust tools for Inverse Dynamics and Inverse Kinematics, new visualization tools, enhanced access for API users, and many usability improvements.
OpenSim 3.2 was released on March 13th, 2014. This update focused on improving the OpenSim scripting interface, accessible through the Graphical User Interface (GUI), Matlab, and now Python. It also added new visualization capabilities and usability improvements in the OpenSim application. Full list of features can be found here.
