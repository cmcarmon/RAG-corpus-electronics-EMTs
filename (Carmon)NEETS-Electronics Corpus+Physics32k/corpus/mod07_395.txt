The average value of a sine wave is 0 volts. View B of figure 4-4 shows how the average voltage 
changes when the negative portion of the sine wave is clipped off. Since the wave form swings positive 
but never negative (past the "zero-volt" reference line), the average voltage is positive. The average 
voltage (Eavg) is determined by the equation:
