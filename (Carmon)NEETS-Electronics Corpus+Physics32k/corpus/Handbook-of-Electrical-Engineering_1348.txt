The  results  of  the  standardization  process  were  announced  in April,  1996. As  indicated  in  Table  15.2,  the
new  2400  bits/s  Federal  Standard  vocoder  replacing  LPC-10e  is  a  version  of  the  Mixed  Excitation  Linear
Prediction  (MELP)  coder  which  uses  several  speciﬁc  enhancements  to  the  basic  MELP  architecture.  These
enhancements  include  multi-stage  VQ  of  the  formant  parameters  based  on  frequency-weighted  bark-scale
spectral distortion, direct VQ of the ﬁrst 10 Fourier coefﬁcients of the excitation using bark-weighted distortion,
and a gain coding technique which is robust to channel errors [McCree et al., 1996].
