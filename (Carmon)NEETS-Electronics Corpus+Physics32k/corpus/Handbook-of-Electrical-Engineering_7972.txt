Arithmetic logic units (ALUs) are combinational logic circuits that can perform basic arithmetic (addition or
subtraction)  or  logical  (AND,  OR,  NOT,  etc.)  operations  on  two  m-bit  operands. ALUs  may  be  constructed
from standard integrated circuits or programmable logic devices and are available as single-chip medium-scale
integrated circuits. Integrated ALUs may be cascaded to form longer word lengths than are available in a single
device.
