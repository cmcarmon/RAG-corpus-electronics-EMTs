Some individuals can produce speech, but it is dysarthric and very difﬁcult to understand. Yet the utterance
does contain information. Can this limited information be used to ﬁgure out what the individual wanted to
say, and then voice it by artiﬁcial means? Research labs are now employing neural network theory to determine
which  pauses  in  an  utterance  are  due  to  content  (i.e.,  between  a  word  or  sentence)  and  which  are  due  to
unwanted halts in speech production.
