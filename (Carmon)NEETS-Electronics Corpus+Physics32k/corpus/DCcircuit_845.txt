Crude as it may appear, this kind of pneumatic signaling system formed the backbone
of many industrial measurement and control systems around the world, and still sees use
today due to its simplicity, safety, and reliability. Air pressure signals are easily transmitted
through inexpensive tubes, easily measured (with mechanical pressure gauges), and are easily
manipulated by mechanical devices using bellows, diaphragms, valves, and other pneumatic
devices. Air pressure signals are not only useful for measuring physical processes, but for
controlling them as well. With a large enough piston or diaphragm, a small air pressure signal
can be used to generate a large mechanical force, which can be used to move a valve or other
controlling device. Complete automatic control systems have been made using air pressure as
the signal medium. They are simple, reliable, and relatively easy to understand. However, the
practical limits for air pressure signal accuracy can be too limiting in some cases, especially
when the compressed air is not clean and dry, and when the possibility for tubing leaks exist.
With the advent of solid-state electronic ampliÔ¨Åers and other technological advances, elec-
trical quantities of voltage and current became practical for use as analog instrument signaling
media. Instead of using pneumatic pressure signals to relay information about the fullness of
a water storage tank, electrical signals could relay that same information over thin wires (in-
stead of tubing) and not require the support of such expensive equipment as air compressors
to operate:
