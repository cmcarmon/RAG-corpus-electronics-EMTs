Moves/Adds/Changes: Cost and Frequency
A  major  portion  of  the  cost  of  LANs  is  the  cost  of  interconnecting  them,  which  experts  acknowledge  can
sometimes exceed the cost of computer hardware and software. Labor and material costs for wiring are almost
always signiﬁcant and can reach $1000 per node just for copper wire. Coax and optical ﬁber, not surprisingly,
are considerably higher.
