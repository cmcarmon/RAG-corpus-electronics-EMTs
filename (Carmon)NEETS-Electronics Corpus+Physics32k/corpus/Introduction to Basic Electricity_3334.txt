components used for electronically controlled 
switches. They are semiconductor devices with 
a bistable action that depends on a PNPN regen-
erative feedback to stay turned on or off. Bistable 
 action refers to locking onto one of two stable states. 
 Regenerative feedback is a method of obtaining 
an increased output by feeding part of the output back 
to the input.
