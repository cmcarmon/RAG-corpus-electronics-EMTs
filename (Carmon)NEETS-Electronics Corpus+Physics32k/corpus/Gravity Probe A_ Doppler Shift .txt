Along with the hydrogen maser, a microwave repeater was also included in the probe in order to measure the Doppler shift of the maser signal. A Doppler shift occurs when a source is moving relative to the observer of that source, and results in a shift in the frequency that corresponds to the direction and magnitude of the source's motion. The maser's signal is Doppler shifted because it is launched vertically at a high speed relative to the Earth, and the results from the maser need to be Doppler shifted in order to be correctly understood.
According to the 1976 press release by Joyce B. Milliner: "The interaction of the electron and proton in the hydrogen atom generates a microwave signal (1.42 billion cycles per second) stable to one part in a quadrillion (1 x 10âˆ’15), or the equivalent of a clock that loses less than two seconds every 100 million years."
