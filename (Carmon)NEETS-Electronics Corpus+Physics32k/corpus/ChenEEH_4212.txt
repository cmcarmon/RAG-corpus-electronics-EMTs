There are three problems with the ALOHA schemes. The
ﬁrst problem is the station not listening to the transmission
medium before sending a packet. The second problem regards
the station not listening to the transmission medium during
the sending of the packet. The last problem involves the
station not taking advantage of a much shorter propagation
delay than the frame transmission time. The shorter propa-
gation delay provides a fast feedback for the state of the
current transmission. Various versions of CSMA have been
proposed to solve only the ﬁrst problem. The variants of
CSMA schemes are dealing with what to do if the transmission
medium is sensed to be busy. These CSMA schemes are
described next.
