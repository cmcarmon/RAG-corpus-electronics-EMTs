in such a way that they become forward biased when a signal reaches a certain voltage. When the forward-biasing
level is reached, the diode serves to hold the output to a ﬁxed voltage and thereby establishes a clipping level.
A biased diode is simply a diode connected to a ﬁxed voltage source. The value and polarity of the voltage
source  determine  what  value  of  total  voltage  across  the  combination  is  necessary  to  forward  bias  the  diode.
Figure 5.11 shows several examples. (In practice, a series resistor would be connected in each circuit to limit
current ﬂow when the diode is forward biased.) In each part of the ﬁgure, we can write Kirchhoff ’s voltage law
