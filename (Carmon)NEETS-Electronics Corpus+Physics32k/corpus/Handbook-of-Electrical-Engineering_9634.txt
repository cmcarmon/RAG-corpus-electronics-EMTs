 of a response over time.
For example, if a computer was controlling a nuclear reactor and the reactor began to overheat, the command
to  open  the  cooling  valves  has  extremely  high  value  until  a  deadline,  when  the  reactor  explodes.  After  that
deadline, there is no value in opening the valves (see Fig. 96.2).
