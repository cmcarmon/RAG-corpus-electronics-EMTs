A Ravigneaux gearset is like a simple planetary gear set, except that each planet gear is replaced by a set of three gears, all on the same carrier. All three gears in a set are seen inside the carrier in the left photo. The gear on the right side of this photo is in slightly farther toward the center of the carrier than the gear it meshes with on the left. The left and right gears turn in the opposite direction. Only the outer planet gears mesh with the ring gear. The primary sun gear (the small sun) meshes with the inner planets, and the secondary sun gear (large sun) meshes with the gears that turn with the outer planets.
The right-most photo shows the other side of the carrier. Of the two meshing gears showing, the one on the right is slightly farther from the center of the carrier, allowing it to mesh with the ring gear.
In general, a Ravigneaux can be configured with each of the three gears in the set having a different number of teeth, but in the Ford FMX, all three have 18 teeth. Multiple planets, turning in the opposite direction and meshing with different sun gears, gives the Ravigneaux the ability to provide multiple speeds and reverse, with just one set of planetary gears. The FMX in the photo has three forward speeds, and reverse.
