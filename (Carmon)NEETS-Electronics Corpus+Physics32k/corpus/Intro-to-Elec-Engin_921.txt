It can be shown that to transfer the ohmic value of impedance from the voltage level on one side
of a three-phase transformer to the voltage level on the other side, the multiplying factor is the
square of the ratio of line-to-line voltages, regardless of whether the transformer connection is
Y–Y, –Y, or –. In some cases, where Y–Y transformation is utilized in particular, it is quite
common to incorporate a third winding, known as tertiary winding, connected in delta. Such
multiwinding transformers with three or more windings are not considered in this text.
