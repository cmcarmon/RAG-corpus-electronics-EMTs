4. Transients programs. Transients programs compute the magnitudes and shapes of transient overvoltages
and  currents  that  result  from  switching  operations  and  lightning  strikes.  Planning  engineers  use  the
results of transients programs to specify BILs for transmission lines, transformers, and other equipment
and to select surge arresters that protect equipment against transient overvoltages.
