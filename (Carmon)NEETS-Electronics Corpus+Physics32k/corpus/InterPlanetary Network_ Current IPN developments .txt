In 2007 AGILE was launched and in 2008 the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and although these are Earth orbiters, their instruments provide directional discrimination. The Fermi Space Telescope uses both wide-area burst detectors and a narrow-angle telescope, and will have a limited ability to spin itself to place a GRB within the telescope field. MESSENGER's gamma instrument is now fully operational, and is adding data to the IPN. Due to falling power from its RTG, Ulysses was decommissioned on June 30, 2009.
