For attenuating ac noise when the low-pass cutoff is greater than 60 Hz, many EEG ampliﬁers have notch
ﬁlters that attenuate only frequencies in a narrow band centered around 60 Hz. Since important signal infor-
mation may also be attenuated, notch ﬁltering should be used as a last resort; one should try to identify and
eliminate the source of interference instead.
