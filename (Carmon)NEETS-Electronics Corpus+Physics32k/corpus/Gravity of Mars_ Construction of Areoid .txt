Areoid represents the gravitational and rotational equipotential figure of Mars, analogous to the concept of "sea level" on Earth. This has been set as the reference frame for developing the MOLA Mission Experiment Gridded Data Records (MEGDRs), which is a global topography model. The topography model is important in mapping the geomorphological features and understanding different kinds of processes on Mars.
To derive the areoid, two parts of works are required. First, as gravity data is essential for identifying the position of the centre of mass of the planet, which is largely affected by the distribution of the mass of the interior, radio tracking data of spacecraft is necessary. This was largely done by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS). Then, the MOLA 2 instrument aboard the MGS, which operates at 400-km elevation orbit, could measure the range (distance) between the spacecraft and the ground surface through counting the round-trip time of flight of the pulse from the instrument. Combination of these two works allows the areoid as well as the MEGDRs to be constructed.
Based on the above, the areoid has taken the radius as the mean radius of the planet at the equator as 3396 km.
