Many ICs also contain other information, including the manufacturer’s cata-
log number and maybe even a code that represents when the chip was made. 
Don’t confuse the date code or catalog number with the part number used to 
identify the device. Manufacturers don’t have a universal standard for how 
they stamp the date code on their integrated circuits, so you may have to do 
some detective work to pick out the actual part number of the IC.
