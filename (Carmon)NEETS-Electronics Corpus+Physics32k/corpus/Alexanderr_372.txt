3. Alternative. We  can  solve  this  circuit  using  circuit  analysis
techniques,  nodal  analysis,  mesh  analysis,  or  PSpice. Let  us
solve  the  problem  using  circuit  analysis  techniques  (this  time
Thevenin  equivalent  circuits)  and  then  check  the  answer  using
two  methods  of  PSpice.
