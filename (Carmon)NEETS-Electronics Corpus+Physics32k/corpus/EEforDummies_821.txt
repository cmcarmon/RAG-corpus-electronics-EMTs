▶✓ Photodiodes are sort of the opposite of light‐emitting diodes, which I 
discuss in Chapter 9. They conduct current or drop voltage only when 
exposed to sufficient light, usually in the infrared (not visible) range. 
Like standard diodes, photodiodes contain two leads: The shorter lead 
is the cathode (negative end) and the longer lead is the anode (positive 
end).
