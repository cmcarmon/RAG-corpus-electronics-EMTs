Figure 30-5 shows the proper setup for a zener 
 diode regulation test. The output of the power sup-
ply is connected with a limiting resistor in series with 
a  zener diode to be tested. A voltmeter is connected 
across the zener diode under test to monitor the  zener 
voltage. The output voltage is slowly increased  until 
the specified current is flowing through the  zener 
 diode. The current is then varied on either side of the 
specified zener current (IZ). If the voltage remains 
constant, the zener diode is operating properly.
