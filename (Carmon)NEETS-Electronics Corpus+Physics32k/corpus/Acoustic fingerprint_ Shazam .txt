In the case of Shazam, their algorithm then picks out points where there are peaks in the graph, labeled as “higher energy content”. In practice, this seems to work out to about three points per song.
Focusing on peaks in the audio greatly reduces the impact that background noise has on audio identification. Shazam builds their fingerprint catalog out as a hash table, where the key is the frequency. They do not just mark a single point in the spectrogram, rather they mark a pair of points: the “peak intensity” plus a second “anchor point”. So their database key is not just a single frequency, it is a hash of the frequencies of both points. This leads to less hash collisions which in turn speeds up catalog searching by several orders of magnitude by allowing them to take greater advantage of the table’s constant (O(1)) look-up time.
This method of acoustic fingerprinting allows applications such as Shazam to have the ability to differentiate between two closely related covers of the same song.
