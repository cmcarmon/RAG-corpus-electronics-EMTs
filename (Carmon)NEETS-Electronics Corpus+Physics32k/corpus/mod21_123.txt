In equipment that uses vacuum tubes, faulty tubes are responsible for more than 50% of all electronic
equipment failures. As a result, testing of electronic tubes is important to you. You can determine the
condition of a tube by substituting an identical tube known to be good for the questionable one. However,
indiscriminate substitution of tubes is to be avoided for at least the following two reasons: (1) detuning of
circuits may result and (2) a tube may not operate properly in a high-frequency circuit even though it
performs well in a low-frequency circuit. Therefore, your knowledge of tube-testing devices and their
limitations, as well as correct interpretation of the test results obtained, is indispensable for accurate and
rapid maintenance.
