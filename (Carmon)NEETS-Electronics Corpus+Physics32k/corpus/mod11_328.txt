Several important differences exist between the slot antenna and its complementary antenna. First, 
the electric and magnetic fields are interchanged. In the case of the dipole antenna shown in figure 3-18, 
the electric lines are horizontal while the magnetic lines form loops in the vertical plane. With the slot 
antenna, the magnetic lines are horizontal and the electric lines are vertical. The electric lines are built up 
across the narrow dimensions of the slot. As a result, the polarization of the radiation produced by a 
horizontal slot is vertical. If a vertical slot is used, the polarization is horizontal.
