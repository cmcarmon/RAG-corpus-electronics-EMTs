The simplest type of radar mixer is the SINGLE ENDED or UNBALANCED CRYSTAL MIXER,
shown in figure 2-24. The mixer illustrated uses a tuned section of coaxial transmission line one-half
wavelength long. This section matches the crystal to the signal echo and the local oscillator inputs. Local
oscillator injection is accomplished by means of a probe. In the coaxial assembly, the signal is injected by
means of a slot. This slot would normally be inserted in the duplexer waveguide assembly and be properly
oriented to provide coupling of the returned signal. In this application, the unwanted signals at the output
of the mixer (carrier frequency, the local oscillator frequency, and sum of these two signals) are
effectively eliminated by a resonant circuit tuned to the intermediate, or difference frequency. One
advantage of the unbalanced crystal mixer is its simplicity. It has one major disadvantage; its inability to
cancel local oscillator noise. Difficulty in detecting weak signals will exist if noise is allowed to pass
through the mixer along with the signal.
