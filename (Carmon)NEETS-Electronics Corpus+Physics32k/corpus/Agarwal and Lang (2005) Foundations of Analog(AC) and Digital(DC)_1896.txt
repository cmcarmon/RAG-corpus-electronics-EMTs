and taking the real part of the resulting expression. Therefore the complex
amplitude Vo given by Equation 13.67 contains all the information about the
amplitude and phase of the actual sinusoidal output vo(t). Therefore we could
very well stop at this point. However, as an exercise,
let us go ahead and
determine the actual output voltage.
