When a liquid drop is put onto a flat surface, two situations may result. If the contact angle is zero, the situation is referred to as complete wetting. If the contact angle is between 0 and 180Â°, the situation is called partial wetting. A wetting transition is a surface phase transition from partial wetting to complete wetting.
