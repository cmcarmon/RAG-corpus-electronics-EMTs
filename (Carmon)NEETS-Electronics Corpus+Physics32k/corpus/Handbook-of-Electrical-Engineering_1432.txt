In  the  standard  AR  formulation  of  linear  prediction,  the  model  parameters  are  selected  to  minimize  the
mean-squared error between the model and the speech data. In one of the variants of linear prediction, the
autocorrelation method, the minimization is carried out for a windowed segment of data. In the autocorrelation
method,  minimizing  the  mean-square  error  of  the  time  domain  samples  is  equivalent  to  minimizing  the
integrated ratio of the signal spectrum to the spectrum of the all-pole model. Thus, linear predictive analysis
is  a  good  method  for  spectral  analysis  whenever  the  signal  is  produced  by  an  all-pole  system.  Most  speech
sounds Ô¨Åt this model well.
