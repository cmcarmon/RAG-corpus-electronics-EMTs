where Prad is the radiated power and Ploss is the power lost in the antenna. Losses in a microstrip antenna occur
in  three  ways:  conductor  loss,  dielectric  loss,  and  surface  wave  loss.  Unless  the  substrate  is  extremely  thin,
conductor loss is generally negligible. For quality microwave substrates (loss tangent £ 0.002), dielectric loss is
also relatively small. Surface waves, which are ﬁelds bound to the dielectric substrate that propagate along its
surface, often account for the dominant loss mechanism for microstrip antennas. As can be seen in Fig. 38.18,
efﬁciency decreases with increasing substrate thickness and dielectric constant, again suggesting the use of low-
dielectric-constant  substrates.  The  overall  radiation  efﬁciency  of  a  microstrip  antenna  on  a  low-dielectric
substrate is typically 95%, or better.
