Introduction
The  Fourier  transform  is  a  mathematical  tool  that  is  used  to  expand  signals  into  a  spectrum  of  sinusoidal
components to facilitate signal analysis and system performance. In certain applications the Fourier transform
is used for spectral analysis, or for spectrum shaping that adjusts the relative contributions of different frequency
components  in  the  ﬁltered  result.  In  other  applications  the  Fourier  transform  is  important  for  its  ability  to
decompose the input signal into uncorrelated components, so that signal processing can be more effectively
implemented  on  the  individual  spectral  components.  Decorrelating  properties  of  the  Fourier  transform  are
important in frequency domain adaptive ﬁltering, subband coding, image compression, and transform coding.
Classical Fourier methods such as the Fourier series and the Fourier integral are used for continuous-time

(CT) signals and systems, i.e., systems in which the signals are deﬁned at all values of

transform and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), are extensions of basic Fourier concepts for DT signals
