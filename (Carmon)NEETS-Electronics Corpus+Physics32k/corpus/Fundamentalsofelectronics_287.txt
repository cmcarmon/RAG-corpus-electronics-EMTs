Here is a circuit involving a diode that is actually simpler to analyze than the previous one. We know that
the current through the resistor must equal that through the diode. Thus, the diodeâ€™s current is proportional
to the input voltage. As the voltage across the diode is related to the logarithm of its current, we see that
the input-output relation is
