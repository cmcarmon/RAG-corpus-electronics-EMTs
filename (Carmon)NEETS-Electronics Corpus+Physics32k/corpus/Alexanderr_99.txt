2.8.2 Design of DC Meters
By  their  nature,  resistors  are  used  to  control  the  ï¬‚ow  of  current.  We
take  advantage  of  this  property  in  several  applications,  such  as  in  a
potentiometer  (Fig.  2.57).  The  word  potentiometer,  derived  from  the
words  potential and  meter,  implies  that  potential  can  be  metered  out.
The potentiometer (or pot for short) is a three-terminal device that oper-
ates on the principle of voltage division. It is essentially an adjustable
voltage divider. As a voltage regulator, it is used as a volume or level
control on radios, TVs, and other devices. In Fig. 2.57,
