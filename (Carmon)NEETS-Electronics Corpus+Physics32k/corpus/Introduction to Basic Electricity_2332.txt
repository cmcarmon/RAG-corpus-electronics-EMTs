A charged capacitor can be removed from the volt-
age source and used as an energy source. However, 
as energy is removed from the capacitor, the voltage 
 diminishes rapidly. In a DC circuit, a capacitor acts as 
an open circuit after its initial charge. An open circuit 
is a circuit with an infinite resistance.
