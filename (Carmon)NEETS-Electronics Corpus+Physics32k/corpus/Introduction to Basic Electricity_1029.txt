  9.  Wash hands before eating or drinking. The lead 
from the solder remaining on the hands can be 
ingested with food.
Certain components used on printed circuit boards 
can be damaged by static electricity referred to as elec-
trostatic discharge (ESD). These static charges are cre-
ated when nonconductive materials, such as plastic 
from bags or synthetic materials from clothing, are 
separated. These charges can be induced on a conduc-
tor, such as skin, and are delivered in the form of a 
spark that passes to another conductor. By touching a 
printed circuit board or semiconductor device, a static 
discharge can be delivered through it that may damage 
a sensitive component or device.
