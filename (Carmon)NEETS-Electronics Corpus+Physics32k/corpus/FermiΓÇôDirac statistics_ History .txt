Before the introduction of Fermi–Dirac statistics in 1926, understanding some aspects of electron behavior were difficult due to seemingly contradictory phenomena. For example, the electronic heat capacity of a metal at room temperature seemed to come from 100 times fewer electrons than were in the electric current. It was also difficult to understand why those emission currents generated by applying high electric fields to metals at room temperature were almost independent of temperature.
The difficulty encountered by the electronic theory of metals at that time was due to considering that electrons were (according to classical statistics theory) all equivalent. In other words, it was believed that each electron contributed to the specific heat an amount on the order of the Boltzmann constant k. This statistical problem remained unsolved until the discovery of F–D statistics.
F–D statistics was first published in 1926 by Enrico Fermi and Paul Dirac. According to Max Born, Pascual Jordan developed in 1925 the same statistics which he called Pauli statistics, but it was not published in a timely manner. According to Dirac, it was first studied by Fermi, and Dirac called it Fermi statistics and the corresponding particles fermions.
F–D statistics was applied in 1926 by Fowler to describe the collapse of a star to a white dwarf. In 1927 Sommerfeld applied it to electrons in metals and in 1928 Fowler and Nordheim applied it to field electron emission from metals. Fermi–Dirac statistics continues to be an important part of physics.
