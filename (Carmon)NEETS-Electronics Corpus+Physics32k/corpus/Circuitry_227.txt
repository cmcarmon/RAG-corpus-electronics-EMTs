4.20  A  transformer  has  1,600  primary  turns  and
 
120  secondary  turns.  If  the  primary  is 
connected  to  a  240  V  r.m.s.  a.c.  mains 
 
 
supply,  determine  the  secondary  voltage. 
4.21   A transformer has 800 primary turns and 60 
secondary 
 
is 
 
connected  to  a  load  resistance  of  15  F,
determine  the  value  of  primary  voltage 
required  to  produce  a  power  of  22.5  W  in 
the load 
(assume  that  the  transformer  is 
loss-free).
