The rules and recommendations of programming methodology are rather independent of particular pro-
gramming languages; however, signiÔ¨Åcant progress in the understanding of programming methods has always
led to the design of new languages or the enhancement of existing ones. Because of the necessity of upward
compatibility,  enhanced  old  languages  are,  in  comparison  to  new  designs,  less  likely  to  realize  progressive
programming concepts satisfactorily. Consequently, the year of its design usually determines how well a language
supports state-of-the-art programming methods.
