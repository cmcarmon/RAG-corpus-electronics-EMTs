Certain  ceramics  such  as  lead  zirconate  titanate  (PZT),  barium  titanate,  and  lead  metaniobate  become
piezoelectric when polarized. They exhibit relatively high electromechanical coupling, are capable of producing
very  large  forces,  and  are  used  extensively  as  sources  and  receivers  for  underwater  sound.  PZT  and  barium
titanate have only a small volume sensitivity; hence they must have one or more surfaces shielded in order to
detect sound efﬁciently. Piezoelectric ceramics have extraordinarily high dielectric coefﬁcients and hence high
capacitance, and they are thus capable of driving long cables without preampliﬁers.
