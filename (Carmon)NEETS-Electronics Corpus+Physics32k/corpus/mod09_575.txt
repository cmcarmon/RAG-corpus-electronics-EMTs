At T0 the +25 volt input signal applied to the circuit appears across R1 and D1. This makes the 
anode of D1 positive with respect to the cathode and it conducts heavily. Diode resistance is very small 
causing C1 to charge quickly. As the voltage across C1 increases, the output voltage decreases. The 
voltage across C1 reaches 25 volts quickly; during most of T0 to T1, the output voltage is 0.
