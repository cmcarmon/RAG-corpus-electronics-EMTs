As current ﬂows in each conductor, a magnetic ﬁeld develops.
Adjacent lines then may induce voltages in nearby conductors
through mutual induction (as seen for transformers, only now
with coupling that is not as tight). This interaction largely
determines the inductance seen by the respective phase cur-
rents. To understand this phenomenon, consider a single line
of radius r and inﬁnite length with some current ﬂow, I, as
sketched in Figure 7.4. Similar to what is done for the trans-
former development, apply Ampe`re’s law to characterize the
magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld at some distance x from the
line can be found by assuming that the ﬁeld is constant at all
points equal distance from the line. The closed path is then a
circle with circumference 2px, which gives:
