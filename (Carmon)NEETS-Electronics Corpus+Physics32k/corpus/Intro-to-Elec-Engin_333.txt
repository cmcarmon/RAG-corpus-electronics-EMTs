Phase Sequence
It is standard practice in the United States to designate the phase A–B–C such that under balanced
conditions the voltage and current in the A-phase lead in time the voltage and current in the
B-phase by 120° and in the C-phase by 240°. This is known as positive phase sequence A–B–C.
The phase sequence should be observed either from the waveforms in the time domain shown in
Figure 4.1.2(a) or from the phasor diagrams shown in Figure 4.1.2(b) or 4.1.4(b), and not from
space or schematic diagrams, such as Figures 4.1.3 and 4.1.4(a). If the rotation of the generator
of Figure 4.1.1 is reversed, or if any two of the three leads from the armature (not counting the
neutral) to the generator terminals are reversed, the phase sequence becomes A–C–B (or C–B–A
or B–A–C), which is known as negative phase sequence.
