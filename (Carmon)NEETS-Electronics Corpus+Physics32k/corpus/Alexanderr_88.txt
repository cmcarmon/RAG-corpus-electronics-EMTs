) or
the wye (Y) or tee (T) network shown in Fig. 2.47 and the delta (
pi (
) network shown in Fig. 2.48. These networks occur by themselves
or  as  part  of  a  larger  network.  They  are  used  in  three-phase  networks,
electrical Ô¨Ålters, and matching networks. Our main interest here is in how
to identify them when they occur as part of a network and how to apply
wye-delta transformation in the analysis of that network.
