During the 1960s, many experimental time-sharing systems
were constructed to test several new operating systems con-
cepts. These included MIT’s Compatible Time Sharing System
(CTSS), the University of Cambridge Multiple Access System,
IBM TSS/360, and the operating systems for the Manchester
University Atlas and the RCA Spectra/70. The most ambitious
project of all was Multics (Multiplexed Information and Com-
puting Service) for the General Electric 645 processor (Orga-
nick, 1972) Multics simultaneously tested many new concepts
such as processes,
interprocess communication, segmented
virtual memory, hierarchical ﬁle system, device independence,
I/O redirection, a high-level language shell.
