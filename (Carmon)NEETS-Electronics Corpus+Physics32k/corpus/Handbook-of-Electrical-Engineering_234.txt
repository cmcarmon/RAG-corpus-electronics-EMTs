The  methods  of  Thévenin  and  Norton  equivalent  circuits  continue  to  be  very  powerful  with  controlled
sources in the circuits, but some complications arise. The controlled sources must be left on for calculation of
the Thévenin (open-circuit) voltage or Norton (short-circuit) current and also for the calculation of the output
impedance  of  the  circuit.  This  usually  eliminates  the  method  of  combining  elements  in  series  or  parallel  to
determine the output impedance of the circuit, and one must either determine the output impedance from the
ratio of the Thévenin voltage to the Norton current or else excite the circuit with an external source and calculate
the response.
