Let us begin by making some general observations about the current and
voltage limits to build up our intuition. Observe that iDS can range only from
0 â†’ VS/RL. The output voltage is VS when iDS is zero. iDS is zero for input
voltages less than VT. Similarly, the output voltage is 0 when the current is
VS/RL, and the input voltage is at some high value greater than VT. The limits
of saturation region operation lie somewhere within the iDS current limits of 0
and VS/RL.
