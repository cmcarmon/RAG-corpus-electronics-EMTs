For a continuous mass distribution with density function ρ(r), a differential volume element dV with position vector r within the mass has a mass element dm = ρ(r)dV. Therefore, the infinitesimal angular momentum of this element is:




d

{\displaystyle d\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times dm\mathbf {v} =\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r} )dV\mathbf {v} =dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {v} }

and integrating this differential over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentum:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\int _{V}dV\mathbf {r} \times \rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {v} }

In the derivation which follows, integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous mass.
