Ignition systems in automobiles have been designed as a straightforward application of electrical
transients. Figure 3.8.1 shows a simpliﬁed ignition circuit for an internal-combustion engine.
The primary inductance, current-limiting resistance, and capacitance form an underdamped series
RLC circuit. Thus, when the points open, an oscillatory current ﬂows through the primary, thereby
inducing the required voltage in the secondary. The points form a switch, which opens and closes
as the engine rotates, exactly at the instant when an ignition spark is needed by one of the cylinders.
During the period when the points are closed, current builds up rather slowly in the primary
winding of the coil, which consists of a pair of mutually coupled inductors, as shown in Figure
3.8.1. The current is interrupted rapidly when the points open. The resulting large rate of change
of current induces a large voltage across the coil secondary, which is connected to the appropriate
spark plug by the distributor.
