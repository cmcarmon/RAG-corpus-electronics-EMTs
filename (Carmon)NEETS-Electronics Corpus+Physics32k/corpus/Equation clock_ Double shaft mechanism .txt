To a close approximation, the equation of time can be represented as the sum of two sine waves, one with a period of one year and the other with a period of six months, with the relative phase varying very slowly (marginally noticeable over the course of a century). See the explanation in Equation of time for more detail.
The double shaft mechanism has two shafts rotating at constant speeds: one turns once a year, and the other twice a year. Cranks or pins attached to the two shafts move the two ends of a combining lever (sometimes referred to as a whippletree) sinusoidally; if the dimensions are chosen correctly, the midpoint of the rod moves in a way that simulates the equation of time.
