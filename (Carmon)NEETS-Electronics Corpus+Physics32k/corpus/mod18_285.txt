Modulator signals of many thousands of volts are applied to the magnetron cathode during operation.
These high voltage levels require large glass posts to insulate the cathode and filaments from the anode
block. In some high-power magnetrons, the cathode is completely enclosed in a container filled with
insulating oil.
