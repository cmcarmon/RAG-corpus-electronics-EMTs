where E is the electric ﬁeld intensity, V/m, and r is the distance, m. For a distance of 1 km (1000 m), the ERP
required to produce a ﬁeld intensity of 100 mV/m is found to be 333.3 W. Since the ﬁeld intensity is proportional
to the square root of the power, ﬁeld intensities may be determined at other powers.
