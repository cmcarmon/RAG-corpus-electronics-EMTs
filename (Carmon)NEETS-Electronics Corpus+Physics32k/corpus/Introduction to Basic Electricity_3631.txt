Transformers are therefore used in power supplies 
to isolate the power supply from the AC voltage source. 
They are also used to step up voltages if higher voltages 
are required or to step down voltages if lower voltages 
are required. If transformers are used in power supplies, 
the AC power source is connected only to the primary 
of the transformer. This isolates the electrical circuits 
from the power source. When selecting a transformer, 
its primary power rating is the first concern. The most 
common primary ratings are 110 to 120 volts and 220 
to 240 volts. The next concern is the transformer’s fre-
quency. Some frequencies are 50 to 60 hertz, 400 hertz, 
and 10,000 hertz. The third concern is the second-
ary voltage and current ratings of the transformer. 
The final concern is its power-handling capability, or 
volt-ampere rating, which is essentially the amount of 
power that can be delivered to the secondary of the 
transformer. It is given as volt-amperes because of the 
loads that can be placed on the secondary.
