which means the fuse should be used in a circuit where the voltage is 250 volts or less. After this is a set
of three numbers and the letter "R," which represent the current rating of the fuse. The "R" indicates the
decimal point. In the example shown, the current rating is 1R00 or 1.00 ampere. Some other examples of
the current rating are shown in the current code table of figure 2-8. The final letter in the old military
designation (A) indicates the time delay rating of the fuse.
