Recall that A is the open-circuit voltage ampliﬁcation. Let us consider the circuit shown
in Figure 5.1.2 in order to explain voltage ampliﬁcation, or voltage gain. In this circuit a signal
voltage vS is applied to the input of the ampliﬁer block, whereas the output terminals are connected
to a load resistance RL. Let us evaluate the ratio of the voltage across the load to the signal voltage
vL/vS, which is known as voltage gain GV,
