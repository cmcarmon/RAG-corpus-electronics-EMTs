The  complexity  and  unpredictability  of  a  C3  environment  prompt  the  inclusion  of  hominal  blocks.  The
ability to respond to changing operational conditions requires “intelligence,” and in a C3 system this intelligence
is distributed between people and algorithms. The human has a marvelous capacity for coping with vague and
confusing data, making sense out of information so fragmentary that it would paralyze a computer. A computer
information processing algorithm has, in turn, an unexcelled capability to process and display data at a rate
that would bewilder a person. Proper marriage of humans and computers yields a robust system, quick to adapt
to changes and capable of handling high data rates. For example, for the various subtasks found in the network
management component of a C3 system, the relative roles of people and algorithms might be that shown in
Fig. 103.4. With the advent of open system architectures, network management appears as a crucial resource
allocation  function.  High  speeds  and  large  databases  are  best  left  within  the  domain  of  the  computer,  while
those nodes demanding insight appropriately have a corporeal ﬂavor.
