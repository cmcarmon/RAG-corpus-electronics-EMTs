This section on surface mount technology (SMT) will familiarize the reader with the process steps in a successful
SMT design. The new user of SMT is referred to Mims [1987] and Leibson [1987] for introductory material.
Being successful with the implementation of SMT means the engineers involved must commit to the principles
of concurrent engineering. It also means that a continuing commitment to a quality techniques is necessary,
whether that is Taguchi, TQM, SPC, DOE, another technique, or a combination of several quality techniques,
lest you too have quality problems with SMT (Fig. 26.1).
