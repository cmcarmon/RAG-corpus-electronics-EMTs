Some roads also have "minimum speed limits", where slow speeds can impede traffic flow or be dangerous.
Signs often use blue circles based on the obligatory signs of the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. A Japanese minimum speed sign has the same design as a maximum speed sign, but with a horizontal line below the number. In the United States of America, they are also identical to their respective maximum speed limit signs with the exception of the text "MINIMUM SPEED".
This minimum speed is not so common, as the risk usually raise with higher speed and not with lower speed.
