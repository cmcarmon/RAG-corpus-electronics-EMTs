In the above graphic, the four segments of the chain are labelled W, X, Y and Z. The magnitudes of their corresponding forces are FW, FX, FY and FZ, respectively.
Assuming that the chain is massless, FX = 0 because segment X is not supporting any weight.
Taking the system at equilibrium, FW and FY are equal — if they were not, the lower pulley would freely turn until they were.
Next, the downward force acting on the lower pulley equal the upward forces acting on it, so
FL = FW + FY, or 2 FW because FW = FY.
Additionally, there is no net torque or moment around the compound pulley, so the clockwise torque is equal to the anticlockwise torque:
FW R + FX r = FY r + FZ R .
Substituting FX and FY from the above equations,
FW R + 0 = FW r + FZ R .
Rearranging gives
FW = FZ · R/R − r .
As FW = F L/2,
F L/2 = FZ · R/R − r .
Finally, the mechanical advantage, F L/F Z = 2 R/R − r  or  2/1 − r/R .
