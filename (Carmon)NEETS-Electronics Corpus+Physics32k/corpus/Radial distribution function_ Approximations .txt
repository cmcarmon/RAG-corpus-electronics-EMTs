For dilute systems (e.g. gases), the correlations in the positions of the particles that



g
(
r
)


{\displaystyle g(r)}
accounts for are only due to the potential



u
(
r
)


{\displaystyle u(r)}
engendered by the reference particle, neglecting indirect effects. In the first approximation, it is thus simply given by the Boltzmann distribution law:

If



u
(
r
)


{\displaystyle u(r)}
were zero for all



r


{\displaystyle r}
– i.e., if the particles did not exert any influence on each other, then



g
(
r
)
=
1


{\displaystyle g(r)=1}
for all





r




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {r}}}
and the mean local density would be equal to the mean density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
: the presence of a particle at O would not influence the particle distribution around it and the gas would be ideal. For distances



r


{\displaystyle r}
such that



u
(
r
)


{\displaystyle u(r)}
is significant, the mean local density will differ from the mean density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, depending on the sign of



u
(
r
)


{\displaystyle u(r)}
(higher for negative interaction energy and lower for positive



u
(
r
)


{\displaystyle u(r)}
).
As the density of the gas increases, the low-density limit becomes less and less accurate since a particle situated in




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
experiences not only the interaction with the particle in O but also with the other neighbours, themselves influenced by the reference particle. This mediated interaction increases with the density, since there are more neighbours to interact with: it makes physical sense to write a density expansion of



g
(
r
)


{\displaystyle g(r)}
, which resembles the virial equation:

This similarity is not accidental; indeed, substituting (12) in the relations above for the thermodynamic parameters (Equations 7, 9 and 10) yields the corresponding virial expansions. The auxiliary function



y
(
r
)


{\displaystyle y(r)}
is known as the cavity distribution function.
