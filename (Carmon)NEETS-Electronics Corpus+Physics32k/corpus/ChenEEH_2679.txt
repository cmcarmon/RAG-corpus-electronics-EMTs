1. FDTD uses no linear algebra. Being a fully explicit
computation, FDTD avoids the difﬁculties with linear
algebra that limit the size of a frequency-domain inte-
gral equation and ﬁnite-element electromagnetics
models to generally fewer than 106 ﬁeld unknowns.
FDTD models with as many as 109 ﬁeld unknowns
