Actuators to drive these wires are quite robust and can print through many layers (up to 6) of a multipart
form. The kinetic energy needed to print through 4–6 layers is normally about 0.5 mJ for 200-mm diameter
wires, 1.0 mJ for 300-mm wires. For 2-layer forms, these energies drop to about 0.3 mJ and 0.45 mJ, respectively.
There are two common approaches to driving the guided wires. One is a pivot-type actuator and the other is
a direct solenoid design (see Fig. 89.37). The magnetic circuit in all cases must be designed to maximize either
(1) the moving wire kinetic energy in the case of a free ﬂight wire conﬁguration or (2) the kinetic energy of
the  combined  armature  and  moving  wire  in  the  case  where  these  two  components  are  either  permanently
connected or remain in contact during the drive cycle.
