When an amorphous material is required to store energy (as in a permanent magnet) or information (as in
magnetic bubbles or thermomagneto-optic ﬁlms), it must have magnetic anisotropy. This is generally produced
by applying a magnetic ﬁeld at high temperatures to the amorphous material. The ﬁeld and temperature must
be high enough to allow a local rearrangement of atoms to take place in order to create the desired degree of
magnetocrystalline anisotropy.
