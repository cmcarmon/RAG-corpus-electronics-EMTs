motors (known as traction motors) are utilized for electric locomotives, cranes, and car dumpers.
Universal motors, operating with either dc or ac excitation, are employed in vacuum cleaners,
food processors, hand tools, and several other household applications. They are available in sizes
of fractional horsepower up to, and well beyond, 1 hp, in speeds ranging between 2000 and 12,000
r/min.
