Extensions to Conventional Disk Architectures
In this subsection, we will focus on techniques for improving the performance of conventional disk systems,
i.e., methods which allow us to reduce the seek time, rotational latency, or transfer time of conventional disks.
By  reducing  disk  service  times,  we  also  decrease  device  queuing  delays.  These  techniques  include  Ô¨Åxed-head
disks, parallel transfer disks, increased disk density, solid-state disks, disk caches, and disk scheduling.
