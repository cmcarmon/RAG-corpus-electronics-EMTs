Feedback is a fundamental engineering principle used to regulate the response of 
systems by using the output of a system to affect its input. The interaction between output 
and  input  ensures  that  a  stable  relationship  is  maintained  even  in  the  presence  of 
disturbances  and  variations  of  system  characteristics.  The  application  of  feedback  is 
ubiquitous in both natural and engineered systems. For example, in physiological systems, 
feedback  is  used  to  regulate  breathing  and  maintain  a  constant  body  temperature;  in 
robotics,  feedback  is  used  to  regulate  the  position  and  angle  of  robotic  arms;  and  in 
electronic amplifiers, feedback is used to make ideal linear amplifiers with stable gain.
