There has been a great deal of research performed in the area of edge detection. Some of the research issues
include  robust  threshold  selection,  window  size  selection,  noise  response,  edge  linking,  and  the  detection  of
edges in moving objects. While it is beyond the scope of this section to discuss these issues in detail, it is obvious
that such things as threshold selection will greatly affect the performance of the edge detection algorithm. If
the threshold is set too high, then many edge points will be missed; if set too low, then many “false’’ edge points
will be obtained because of the inherent noise in the image. The investigation of the “optimal’’ choice of the
threshold is an important research area. Selection of the particular window operation to enhance the edges of
an image, as an initial step in edge detection, has recently been based on using models of the performance of
the human visual system in detecting edges.
