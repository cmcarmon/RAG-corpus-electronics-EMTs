The difference amplifier abstraction is shown in Figure 8.26. It is a two-port device with
one differential input port and one single-ended output port. The input port has two
input terminals. The + input is called the non-inverting input and the âˆ’ input is called
the inverting input. It has an output port across which vO appears.
