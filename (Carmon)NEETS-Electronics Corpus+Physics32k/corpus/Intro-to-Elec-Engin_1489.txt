The latest wireless communications technology is the personal satellite phone. The coverage
is planetary and one can reach anywhere on earth. Examples include the Iridium satellite handset
developed by Motorola and others from the Teledesic constellation. Special requirements, such as
sending and receiving data or faxes, can be handled by the new handheld computer-and-mobile-
phone hybrids such as Nokiaâ€™s 9000i and the Ericsson DI27. Mobile phones with a Web browser
capability are also available. We have yet to see the more exciting new developments in the
telecommunications industry with computers, networking, and wireless technology.
