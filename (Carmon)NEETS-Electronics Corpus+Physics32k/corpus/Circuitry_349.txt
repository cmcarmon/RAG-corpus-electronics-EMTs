determines 
Because  this  form  of  feedback  has  the  effect  of 
reducing the overall gain of the circuit, this form of 
feedback  is  known  as  negative  feedback. An 
alternative  form  of  feedback,  where  the  output  is 
fed  back  in  such  a  way  as  to  reinforce  the  input 
(rather  than  to  subtract  from  it)  is  known  as 
positive feedback. This form of feedback is used in 
oscillator circuits (see Chapter 9).  
  Figure  7.13  shows  the  block  diagram  of  an 
amplifier  stage  with  negative  feedback  applied.  In 
this circuit, the proportion of the output voltage fed 
back  to  the  input  is  given  by  J and  the  overall 
voltage gain will be given by:
