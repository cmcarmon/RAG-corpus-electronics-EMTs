Strategies: General Discussion
The most naive way of using an optimization program would be to take all the measured data for all devices,
put them into one big ﬁle, and ﬁt to all these data with all model parameters simultaneously. Even for a very
high quality, robust optimization program the chances of this method converging are slight. Even if the program
does  converge,  it  is  almost  certain  that  the  values  of  the  parameters  will  be  very  unphysical.  This  kind  of
approach is an extreme case of global optimization. We call any optimization technique that tries to ﬁt with
parameters to data outside their region of applicability a global approach. That is, if we try to ﬁt to saturation
