Back to the Future: The Card Game (BttF) comes with 100 cards of which there are 24 Timeline cards, 10 ID cards and the rest game cards. The game cards consist of items, time machines, doubleback, action and power action cards. Similar to Chrononauts, BttF lays out the timeline cards on the table to make a board with each era in the movies group together. Each player randomly gets an ID card which gives goals, or timeline changes need to make sure that future character exists. To lock in the goal and win, the player must go back in time and stop Doc Brown from inventing time travel.
