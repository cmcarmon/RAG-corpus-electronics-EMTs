This method applies to objects that are supposedly sealed.
First the device under test will be exposed for an extended length of time to a high helium pressure in a "bombing" chamber.
If the part is leaky, helium will be able to penetrate the device.
Later the device will be placed in a vacuum chamber, connected to a vacuum pump and a mass spectrometer. The tiny amount of gas that entered the device under pressure will be released in the vacuum chamber and sent to the mass spectrometer where the leak rate will be measured.
This test method applies to implantable medical devices, crystal oscillator, saw filter devices.
This method is not able to detect a massive leak as the tracer gas will be quickly pumped out when test chamber is pumped down.
