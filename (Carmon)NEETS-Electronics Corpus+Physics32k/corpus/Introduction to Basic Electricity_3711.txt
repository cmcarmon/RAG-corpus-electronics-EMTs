In all previous cases, the DC voltage is limited to the 
peak value of the input sine wave. When higher DC 
voltages are required, a step-up transformer is used. 
However, higher DC voltages can be produced with-
out a step-up transformer. Circuits that are capable 
of producing higher DC voltages without the benefit 
of a transformer are called voltage multipliers. Two 
 voltage multipliers are the voltage doubler and 
the  voltage tripler.
