microelectronic  packages  have  not  diminished.  Because  of  increased  device  densities  and  higher  operating
speeds, chip heat removal requirements have actually risen from 0.1 to 0.3 W, typical of the SSI devices used
in the early 1960s, to 1 to 5 W in the LSI ECL components and VLSI CMOS devices of the mid-1980s, and to
values in the range of 15 to 30 W for commercial equipment in the early 1990s. Projections of current trends
suggest that by the year 2000, the thermal designer will have to contend with chip power dissipations in excess

of 150  W, producing surface heat ﬂuxes of nearly 80 W/cm
