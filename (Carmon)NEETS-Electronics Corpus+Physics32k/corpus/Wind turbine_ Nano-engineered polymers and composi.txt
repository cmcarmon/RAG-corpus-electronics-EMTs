Additions of small amount (0.5 weight %) of nanoreinforcement (carbon nanotubes or nanoclay in the polymer matrix of composites, fiber sizing or interlaminar layers can allow to increase the fatigue resistance, shear or compressive strength as well as fracture toughness of the composites by 30â€“80%. Research has also shown that that the incorporation of small amount of carbon nanotubes/CNT can increase the lifetime up to 1500%.
