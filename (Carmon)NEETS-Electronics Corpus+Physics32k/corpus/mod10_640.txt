The advantages of the polar-coordinate graph are immediately evident. The source, which is at the 
center of the observation circles, is also at the center of the graph. By looking at a polar-coordinate plot of 
a radiation pattern, you can immediately see the direction and strength of radiation put out by the source. 
Therefore, the polar-coordinate graph is more useful than the rectangular-coordinate graph in plotting 
radiation patterns.
