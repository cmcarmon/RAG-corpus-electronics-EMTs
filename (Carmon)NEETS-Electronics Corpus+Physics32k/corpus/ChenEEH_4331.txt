The most interesting observation when considering ntuple
vectors is that while one can multiply scalars together or
multiply vectors by scalars, one simply cannot multiply two
vectors together. Example 2 illustrates this dilemma. The con-
cept of vector multiplication together with a vector space
extends to the concept of an algebra. This is the additional
mathematical understanding one must master to incorporate
the common manifestation of vector multiplication found in
the tensor product.
