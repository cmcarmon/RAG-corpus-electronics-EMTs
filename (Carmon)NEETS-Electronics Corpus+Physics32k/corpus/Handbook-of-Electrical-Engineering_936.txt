where H is the heat generation term, which includes resistive (Joule) heating as well as recombination heating,
Hu.  The  terms  s(T),  l(T)  represent  the  speciÔ¨Åc  heat  and  the  thermal  conductivity  of  the  material  (both
temperature dependent). Inclusion of the heat equation is essential in many power device problems.
