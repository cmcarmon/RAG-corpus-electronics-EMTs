No  great  work  is  ever  done  in  a  hurry.  To  develop  a  great  scientiﬁc
discovery,  to  print  a  great  picture,  to  write  an  immortal  poem,  to
become a minister, or a famous general—to do anything great requires
time,  patience,  and  perseverance.  These  things  are  done  by  degrees,
“little by little.”
