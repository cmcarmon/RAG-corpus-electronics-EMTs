Perhaps you have been around a public address system when a squeal or high-pitched noise has 
come from the speaker. Someone will turn down the volume and the noise will stop. That noise is an 
indication that the amplifier (at least one stage of amplification) has begun oscillating. Oscillation is 
covered in detail in NEETS Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits. For 
now, you need only realize that the oscillation is caused by a small part of the signal from the amplifier 
output being sent back to the input of the amplifier. This signal is amplified and again sent back to the 
input where it is amplified again. This process continues and the result is a loud noise out of the speaker. 
The process of sending part of the output signal of an amplifier back to the input of the amplifier is called 
FEEDBACK.
