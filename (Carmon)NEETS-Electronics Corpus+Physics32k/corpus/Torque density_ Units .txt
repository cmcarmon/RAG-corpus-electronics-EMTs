In SI units, torque density is expressed in joules per cubic metre or equivalently newton-metres per cubic metre (though dimensionally equivalent to the pascal, that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-millimetres per cubic millimetre.
In U.S. customary units, torque density is expressed in foot-pounds force per cubic foot, or inch-pounds force per cubic inch or ounce-force inches per cubic inch.
