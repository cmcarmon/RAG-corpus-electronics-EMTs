BROADCAST.â€”Broadcast (bc) is the type of operation in which one station transmits information 
on one or more channels directed to more than one station and/or unit. The broadcast system has no 
provision for receipt or reply; however, special arrangements may require the receiving station to reply or 
receipt for the message at a later time by other means. Broadcasts are the primary means of delivering 
messages to the fleet. Since Navy units copying broadcasts are not required to receipt for messages 
received, they can maintain radio silence while still receiving essential messages.
