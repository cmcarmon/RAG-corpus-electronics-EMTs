Report program generators (RPG) are used to generate programs to print detail and summary reports 
of data files. Figure 3-1 is an example of a printed report. RPGs were designed to save programming time. 
Rather than writing procedural steps in a language like BASIC or COBOL, the RPG programmer writes 
the printed report requirements on specially designed forms.
