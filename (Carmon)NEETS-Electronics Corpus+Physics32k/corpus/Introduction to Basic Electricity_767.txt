Educators use Multisim to guide learning and 
 exploration  of  circuit  behavior  by  using what-if 
 experiments and simulation-driven instruments. 
Multisim and industry-standard LabVIEW measure-
ment software by National Instrument (NI) were com-
bined with the NI elViS, a prototyping workstation, 
to form a complete development platform. labView 
 (Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation Engineering 
Workbench) is a design and development system 
 using a visual programming language from National 
Instruments. Multisim and NI Ultiboard combine 
powerful SPICE simulation and analysis with flexible 
layout tools to quickly and professionally complete a 
wide variety of PCB designs.
