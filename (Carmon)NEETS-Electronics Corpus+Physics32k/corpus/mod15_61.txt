The symbols shown in views A and B of figure 1-3 are used when it is necessary to show only the 
external connections to a synchro, while those shown in views C, D, and E are used when it is important 
to see the positional relationship between the rotor and stator. The letters R and S, in conjunction with an 
Arabic number, are used to identify the rotor and stator connections; for example, R1, R2, S1, S2, and S3. 
The small arrow on the rotor symbol indicates the angular displacement of the rotor; in figure 1-3 the 
displacement is zero degrees.
