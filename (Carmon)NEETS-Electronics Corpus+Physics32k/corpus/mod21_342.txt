The volume unit (vu) meter is used in audio equipment to indicate input power to a transmitter or to 
a transmission line. This type of meter has special characteristics, such as a standardized speed of pointer 
movement, speed of return, and calibration. The measurement of the average power level and its rate of 
variation with respect to time depends not only on the signal characteristics, but also on the time interval 
over which the average is being taken. Accordingly, the speed of response of the instrument used to 
measure average power is of particular concern. The unit of measurement is the volume unit (vu), which 
is numerically equal to the number of dB above or below the reference level of 1 milliwatt into a 600-ohm 
load (provided the standard instrument was calibrated under constant-amplitude, sine-wave conditions). A 
change of one vu is the same as a change of one decibel. Therefore, the vu value obtained represents 
averages of instantaneous power of speech or music obtained by an instrument having particular dynamic 
characteristics. The vu readings are equivalent to the power level in decibels only if the sinusoidal 
waveform is of constant amplitude.
