Figure 83.25 shows the I-V characteristic of a typical gas discharge found in plasma displays. Note that the
current is plotted on a log scale over nine orders of magnitude. The most striking feature is the very strong
non-linearity at the ﬁring voltage, which is a major attribute of gas discharges that allows matrix addressing.
When  the  discharge  current  has  sufﬁcient  magnitude,  space  charge  distortion  sets  in  and  the  characteristic
achieves a negative resistance region. Most plasma displays operate near the junction of the normal and the
abnormal glow regions of the characteristic.
