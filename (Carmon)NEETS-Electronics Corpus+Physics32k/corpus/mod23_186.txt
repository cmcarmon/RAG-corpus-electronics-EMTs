2. Vacuum-column buffering systems operate like the spring-tension systems. They also regulate 
the speed control servos that control tape reel speed. But, as shown in figure 4-5, the vacuum-column 
buffer system uses a vacuum chamber instead of a spring to hold a length of magnetic tape as slack during 
tape recorder starts and stops. An electronic sensor in the vacuum chamber helps to control how much 
tape is in the buffer.
