the earth or sea, for example, are easily treated using plane
wave theory. Even when the incident wave front is actually
spherical in shape, as from a transmitting antenna, plane wave
theory may often be approximately used with accurate results.
This chapterâ€™s discussion assumes article that the regions of
interest are homogeneous (the material properties are constant)
and isotropic, which covers most cases of practical interest.
