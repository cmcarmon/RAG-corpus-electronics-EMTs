It  should  be  observed  in  the  following  examples  that  one  cannot
directly  analyze  transistor  circuits  using  nodal  analysis  because  of  the
potential difference between the terminals of the transistor. Only when the
transistor is replaced by its equivalent model can we apply nodal analysis.
