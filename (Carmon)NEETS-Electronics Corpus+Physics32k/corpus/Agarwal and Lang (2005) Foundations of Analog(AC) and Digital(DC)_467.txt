and our simple node analysis can be applied without modification. We will do
examples using both the modified and unmodified versions of the node method.
To illustrate our modified method of node analysis for a circuit containing
a dependent source, consider the analysis of the circuit shown in Figure 3.26.
This circuit has one dependent source, namely a CCCS. To analyze this circuit
using the node method, we first replace its CCCS with an independent current
source carrying a known current, say I, and analyze the resulting circuit. The
resulting circuit, however, is exactly that shown in Figure 3.10, which we have
already analyzed using the node method in Section 3.3. Note that the value I in
Figure 3.10 replaces the value Î±i1 in Figure 3.26. Thus, we are partially done
with the analysis of the circuit in Figure 3.26.
