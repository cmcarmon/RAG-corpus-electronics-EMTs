As an illustration, if you hang a weight on a spring it extends in direct proportion to the load. That is the same effect that occurs in the elastic deformation part of the standard tensile test.
This is normally written as: applied stress = Young’s modulus * strain
That is: σ = Y * e
Commonly known as: Hooke’s Law.
Where stress is a force ( a vector property) divided by the cross sectional area. Strain is the displacement (also a vector quantity) per unit length and is also a vector quantity. A vector quantity requires three numbers to define its direction. It can be represented then by a number with one subscript, Ui, where i takes the numbers 1 to 3. Such a quantity can be referred to as a tensor of rank 1. The rank refers to the number of subscripts. The strains e can be formally written as a differential or gradient. So that, if u1 was the extension in the x direction, we would write the strain as δu1/δx. We also know that when we stretch something it gets thinner in the direction normal to the stretch direction. This is the Poisson effect and the ratio extension /contraction is the Poisson ratio.
