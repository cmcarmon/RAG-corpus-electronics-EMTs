Other Effects
Besides  hydrometeors,  the  atmosphere  has  the  composition
given  in  Table  37.2.  While  attenuation  of  EM  waves  by
hydrometeors may result from both absorption and scatter-
ing, gases act only as absorbers. Although some of these gases
do not absorb microwaves, some possess permanent electric
and/or  magnetic  dipole  moment  and  play  some  part  in
