If you look at figure 4-2, you see a list of SERVMART items that have been typed on a preprinted 
form. To most people this is just another piece of paper; however, to the Storekeeper (SK) it is a source 
document to be used to provide input data to the computer. In this example, the SERVMART form deals 
with requisitioning supplies. The form could be sent to the data-entry department to be used as a source 
document. There the data-entry operator can key the data into or on whatever computer medium is to be 
used, according to a prescribed format. The data elements are numbered in the order they are to be keyed: 
(1) document identification, (2) stock number, (3) unit of issue, (4) quantity, and so on. You'll notice we 
need more than numbers, and that is where coding systems come into play.
