A multimode graded-index fiber's source-to-fiber coupling efficiency and insensitivity to
microbending and macrobending losses are its most distinguishing characteristics. The fiber core size and
D affect the amount of power coupled into the core and loss caused by microbending and macrobending.
Coupled power increases with both core diameter and D , while bending losses increase directly with core
diameter and inversely with D . However, while these values favor high D s, a smaller D improves fiber
bandwidth. In most applications, a multimode graded-index fiber with a core and cladding size of
62.5/125 m m offers the best combination of the following properties:
