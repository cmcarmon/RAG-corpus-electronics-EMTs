Figure 5-1 illustrates the cutback method for measuring fiber attenuation. The cutback method
begins by measuring, with an optical power meter, the output power P1 of the test fiber of known length
(L) (figure 5-1, view A). Without disturbing the input light conditions, the test fiber is cut back to an
approximate 2-m length. The output power P2 of the shortened test fiber is then measured (figure 5-1,
view B). The fiber attenuation AT and the attenuation coefficient a are then calculated.
