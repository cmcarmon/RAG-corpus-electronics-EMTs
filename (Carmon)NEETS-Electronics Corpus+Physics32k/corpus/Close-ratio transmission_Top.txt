A close-ratio transmission is a vehicle transmission in which the difference between the gear ratios of the gears is minimized relative to other transmissions used in similar vehicles. The use of "close" describes nearness rather than open-ness (i.e. open vs close).
There is no industry standardization between manufacturers as to what constitutes a close-ratio transmission. Therefore, a transmission that one manufacturer terms close-ratio may not necessarily be considered close-ratioed by another manufacturer.
