Although it is convenient to consider plane waves of inﬁnite lateral extent, as was done above, real sources
generate  ﬁnite  beams  of  ultrasound.  These  sources  may  be  unfocused,  but  for  the  typical  diagnostic  system
they are focused. Figure 116.4 shows the acoustic ﬁeld from a typical focused source. The source consists of a
piezoelectric transducer which converts electrical to acoustic energy and vice versa. Most transducers for medical
applications are made from ceramic materials such as a lead zirconate titanate (PZT) mixture. For a circular
aperture these may be circular disks with a plano-concave lens mounted in front to produce spherical focusing.
Alternatively,  the  transducer  itself  may  be  a  spherical  segment  that  produces  a  focused  ﬁeld  without  a  lens.
Some  probes  utilize  electronic  focusing  methods.  Such  a  phased  array  probe  consists  of  many  individual
elements which can be excited with signals having a controlled delay with respect to one another such that the
