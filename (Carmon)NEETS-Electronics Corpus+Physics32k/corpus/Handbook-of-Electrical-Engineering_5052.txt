Most, but not all, sensors are transducers, employing one or more transduction mechanisms to produce an
electrical output signal. Sometimes sensors are classiÔ¨Åed as direct and indirect sensors according to how many
transduction  mechanisms  are  used.  For  example,  a  mercury  thermometer  produces  a  change  in  volume  of
mercury in response to a temperature change via thermal expansion, but the output is a mechanical displace-
ment and not an electrical signal. Another transduction mechanism is required. A thermometer is still a useful
sensor since humans can read the change in mercury height using their eyes as the second transducing element.
However, in order to produce an electrical output for use in a control loop, the height of the mercury would
have to be converted to an electrical signal. This could be accomplished using capacitive effects. However, there
are more direct temperature sensing methods, i.e., one where an electrical output is produced in response to
a  change  in  temperature. An  example  is  given  in  the  next  section  on  physical  sensors.  Figure  56.1  depicts  a
