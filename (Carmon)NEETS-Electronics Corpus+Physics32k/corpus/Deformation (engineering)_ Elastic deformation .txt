This type of deformation is reversible. Once the forces are no longer applied, the object returns to its original shape. Elastomers and shape memory metals such as Nitinol exhibit large elastic deformation ranges, as does rubber. However, elasticity is nonlinear in these materials. Normal metals, ceramics and most crystals show linear elasticity and a smaller elastic range.
Linear elastic deformation is governed by Hooke's law, which states:




σ
=
E
ε


{\displaystyle \sigma =E\varepsilon }

Where



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
is the applied stress,



E


{\displaystyle E}
is a material constant called Young's modulus or elastic modulus, and ε is the resulting strain. This relationship only applies in the elastic range and indicates that the slope of the stress vs. strain curve can be used to find Young's modulus (



E


{\displaystyle E}
). Engineers often use this calculation in tensile tests. The elastic range ends when the material reaches its yield strength. At this point, plastic deformation begins.
Note that not all elastic materials undergo linear elastic deformation; some, such as concrete, gray cast iron, and many polymers, respond in a nonlinear fashion. For these materials Hooke's law is inapplicable.
