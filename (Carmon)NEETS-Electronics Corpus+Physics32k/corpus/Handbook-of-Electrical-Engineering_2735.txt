However, this technology instead has evolved over a long period of time (about three decades), starting with
only  a  few  gates  per  IC,  with  the  number  of  gates  per  IC  doubling  consistently  about  every  18  months  (a
progression  referred  to  as  Moore’s  Law),  and  evolving  to  the  present  high  gate  densities  per  IC.  Projections
[The  National  Technology  Roadmap  for  Semiconductors,  1994]  of  this  evolution  over  the  next  15  years,  as
shown in Table 25.2, promise continued dramatic advances in the amount of logic and memory which will be
provided  on  individual  ICs.  Paralleling  the  technology  evolution,  computer-aided  design  (CAD)  tools  and
electronics design automation (EDA) tools [Rubin, 1987; Sherwani, 1993; Hill and Peterson, 1993; Banerjee,
1994] have evolved to assist designers of the increasingly complex ICs. With these CAD tools, today’s design
teams effectively have an army of very “experienced” designers embedded in the tools, capable of applying the
knowledge gained over the long and steady history of IC evolution. This prior experience captured in CAD/EDA
tools includes the ability to convert a high-level description [Camposano and Wolf, 1991; Gajski et al., 1992]
of a speciﬁc function (e.g., ALU, register, control unit, microcontroller, etc.) into an efﬁcient physical imple-
mentation of that function.
