The basic logic gates described earlier are used to implement more advanced functions and
are often combined to form logic blocks (or modules) which are available in compact IC packages.
Although SSI packages were common basic units at one time, the trend now is to integration on an
even larger scale. Entire digital systems, such as those to be discussed later, are now available in IC
form, and those ICs in turn become blocks for building even larger systems. The ICs are mounted
in packages known as DIPs (dual in-line packages), each with 8, 14, or more wires (pins) meant
to be plugged into corresponding pin sockets. The actual gates, with the same logic diagrams,
can be made with several different kinds of internal construction, giving rise to different logic
families. In general blocks of one family are compatible with other blocks of the same family, but
not with those of other families.
