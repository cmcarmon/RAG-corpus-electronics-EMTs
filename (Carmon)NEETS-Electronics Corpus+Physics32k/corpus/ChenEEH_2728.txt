where ^xx, ^yy, and ^zz are unit vectors in the x, y, and z coordinate
directions. After performing the vector cross product in equa-
tion 9.31 and writing out the x, y, and z vector component
equations, we obtain a homogeneous system (zero right-hand
side) of three equations in the unknowns Vx, Vy, and Vz.
Setting the determinant of this system equal to zero results in:
