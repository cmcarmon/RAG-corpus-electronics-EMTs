of local networking. The local network technology including
the wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) was then introduced
followed by various wireless network access technologies, like
FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, and WCDMA. The convergence of
varieties of networks under the Internet has begun. One im-
portant driver has been the introduction of Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP) that could provide a framework for Integrated
Multimedia Network Service (IMS). The convergence wonâ€™t be
possible without extensive use of a Softswitch, the creation of
ALL-IP architecture and providing broadband access utilizing
optical networking technologies.
