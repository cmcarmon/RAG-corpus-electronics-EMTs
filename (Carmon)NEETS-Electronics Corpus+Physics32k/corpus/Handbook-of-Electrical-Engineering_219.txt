where I0 and VT are constants. We note that the base current depends
on  the  base-emitter  voltage  only,  but  in  a  nonlinear  manner.  We  can
represent  this  current  by  a  voltage-controlled  current  source,  but  the
more common representation would be that of a nonlinear conductance,
GBE(vBE), where
