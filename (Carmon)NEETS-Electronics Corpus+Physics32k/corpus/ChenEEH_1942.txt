508 nets, 34% more tracks are required than in a non-FT
circuit to put the necessary CSs in place for reconﬁguration.
Good reliability and yield improvements are afforded by static
CS insertion that can tolerate one faulty cell per row; for
example, the percentage doubles a 35% non-FT yield for a
16  16 array and increases a non-FT reliability of 0.7 to
0.95. Net delays changed minimally (by at most approximately
7%) after reconﬁguration. These results establish the static NC
method as one of the best available for software-based recon-
ﬁguration of FPGAs with respect to several metrics: track
overhead, reliability improvement, reconﬁguration time, and
circuit delay increase.
