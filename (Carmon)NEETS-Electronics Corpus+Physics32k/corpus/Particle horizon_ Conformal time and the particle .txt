In terms of comoving distance, the particle horizon is equal to the conformal time



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
that has passed since the Big Bang, times the speed of light

. In general, the conformal time at a certain time

{\displaystyle \eta (t_{0})=\eta _{0}=1.48\times 10^{18}\ {\rm {s}}}
. Note that the conformal time is not the age of the universe. Rather, the conformal time is the amount of time it would take a photon to travel from where we are located to the furthest observable distance provided the universe ceased expanding. As such,




η

0




{\displaystyle \eta _{0}}
is not a physically meaningful time (this much time has not yet actually passed), though, as we will see, the particle horizon with which it is associated is a conceptually meaningful distance.
The particle horizon recedes constantly as time passes and the conformal time grows. As such, the observed size of the universe always increases. Since proper distance at a given time is just comoving distance times the scale factor (with comoving distance normally defined to be equal to proper distance at the present time, so

{\displaystyle a(t_{0})=1}
