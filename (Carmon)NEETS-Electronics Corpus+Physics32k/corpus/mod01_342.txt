The chemical action that occurs in the cell while the current is flowing causes hydrogen bubbles to 
form on the surface of the anode. This action is called POLARIZATION. Some hydrogen bubbles rise to 
the surface of the electrolyte and escape into the air, some remain on the surface of the anode. If enough 
bubbles remain around the anode, the bubbles form a barrier that increases internal resistance. When the 
internal resistance of the cell increases, the output current is decreased and the voltage of the cell also 
decreases.
