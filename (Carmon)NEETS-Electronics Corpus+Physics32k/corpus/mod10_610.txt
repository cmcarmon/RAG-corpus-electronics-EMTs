The electric field was chosen as the reference field because the intensity of the wave is usually 
measured in terms of the electric field intensity (volts, millivolts, or microvolts per meter). When a 
single-wire antenna is used to extract energy from a passing radio wave, maximum pickup will result 
when the antenna is oriented in the same direction as the electric field. Thus a vertical antenna is used for 
the efficient reception of vertically polarized waves, and a horizontal antenna is used for the reception of 
horizontally polarized waves. In some cases the orientation of the electric field does not remain constant.
