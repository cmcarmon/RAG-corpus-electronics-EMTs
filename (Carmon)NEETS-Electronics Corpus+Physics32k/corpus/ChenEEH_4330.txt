Although many engineers tend to think of this ntuple example
as synonymous with the deﬁnition of a vector space, this
interpretation is limiting. For example, the set of polynomials
of degree less than m > 0 with real coefﬁcients satisﬁes all
axioms of a vector space taking into account standard polyno-
mial addition and multiplication. Section 1.5 will examine
polynomials in greater detail.
