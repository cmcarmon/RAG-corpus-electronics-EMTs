A	notable	individual	in	the	field	of	electromagnetism	is	Carl	Friedrich	Gauss.	He
is	a	German	mathematician	who	put	together	the	critical	electromagnetism
concepts	in	the	form	of	a	law	called	Gauss	Law.	According	to	him,	to	determine
the	relevance	of	the	distribution	of	electric	charges,	the	circuit’s	electric	field,	in	its
entirety,	must	be	evaluated.
Gauss	Law	allows	mathematical	expression	with	the	employment	of	integral	and
differential	calculus,	preferably	in	vector	form.	For	a	beginner	in	circuitry,	the
particular	technique	of	demonstration	is	advised	since	it	grants	a	clear	perspective
of	the	concept	of	electromagnetism.
The	integral	formula:
**representations:														ΦE	=	electric	field
ε0	=	electric	constant
Q	=	total	electric	charge
