In the third of the four major methods of analysis for networks containing
nonlinear elements, we represent the nonlinear v i characteristics of each
nonlinear element by a succession of straight-line segments, then make cal-
culations within each straight-line segment using the linear analysis tools
already developed. This is called piecewise linear analysis. We will first illus-
trate piecewise linear analysis by using as an example a very simple piecewise
linear model for the diode called the ideal diode model.
