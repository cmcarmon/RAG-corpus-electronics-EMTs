A piston pump is a type of positive displacement pump where the high-pressure seal reciprocates with the piston. Piston pumps can be used to move liquids or compress gases. They can operate over a wide range of pressures. High pressure operation can be achieved without a strong effect on flow rate. Piston pumps can also deal with viscous media and media containing solid particles .
