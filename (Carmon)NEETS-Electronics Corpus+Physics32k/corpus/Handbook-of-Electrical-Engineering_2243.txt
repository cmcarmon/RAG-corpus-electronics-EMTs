Electrical Breakdown
In sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁelds a measurable fraction of electrons (or holes) acquires sufﬁcient energy to
break the valence bond. Such an event (called impact ionization) results in the creation of an electron–hole
pair by the energetic electron. Both the primary and secondary electrons as well as the hole are accelerated by
the  electric  ﬁeld  and  may  participate  in  further  acts  of  impact  ionization.  Usually,  the  impact  ionization  is
balanced by recombination processes. If the applied voltage is high enough, however, the process of electron
multiplication leads to avalanche breakdown. The threshold energy Eth (the minimum electron energy required
to produce an electron–hole pair) is determined by energy and momentum conservation laws. The latter usually
results in Eth > Eg, as shown in Table 22.1.
