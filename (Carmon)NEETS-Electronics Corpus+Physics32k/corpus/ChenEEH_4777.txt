The principle in adapting the action network is to indirectly
back-propagate the error between the desired ultimate objec-
tive, denoted by Uc, and the approximate J function from the
critic network. Since 0 is deÔ¨Åned as the reinforcement signal
for success, Uc is set to 0 in the discussion is design paradigm
and in the following case studies. In the action network, the
state measurements are used as inputs to create a control as the
output of the network. In turn, the action network can be
implemented by either a linear or a nonlinear network,
depending on the complexity of the problem. The weight
updating in the action network can be formulated as follows.
Let the following be true:
