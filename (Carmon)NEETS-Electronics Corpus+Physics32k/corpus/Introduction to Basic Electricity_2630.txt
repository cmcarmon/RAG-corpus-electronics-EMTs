The current and applied voltage in a capacitive 
AC circuit differs from those in a pure resistive cir-
cuit. In a pure resistive circuit, the current flows in 
phase with the applied voltage. Current and voltage 
in a capacitive AC circuit do not flow in phase with 
each other  (Figure 24-1). When the voltage starts to 
increase, current is at maximum because the capaci-
tor is  discharged. As soon as the capacitor charges to 
the peak AC voltage, the charging current drops to 
0. As the voltage begins to drop, the capacitor begins 
 discharging. The current begins to increase in a nega-
tive direction. When the current is at maximum, the 
voltage is at 0. This relationship is described as 90° out 
of phase. The current leads the applied voltage in a 
 capacitive circuit. The negative voltage peaks when the 
voltage equals 0 volts. The phase difference continues 
through each cycle. In a purely capacitive circuit, the 
current leads the voltage by an angle of 90°. This can 
be represented by the acronym iCE. Current (I) leads 
the voltage (E) in a capacitive (C) circuit.
