Second, look at the area of the curves to the left of fr. This area shows the relative reactances of the 
circuit at frequencies BELOW resonance. To these LOWER frequencies, XC will always be greater than 
XL. There will always be some capacitive reactance left in the circuit after all inductive reactance has 
been cancelled. Because the impedance has a reactive component, there will be a phase shift. We can also 
state that below fr the circuit will appear capacitive.
