Teleportation is a principle plot device in the Harold Shea stories by L. Sprague de Camp and Fletcher Pratt and later other others. The protagonists utilize teleportation to project themselves into the universes and worlds, but it is an inexact science, and they miss their target realities as often as they hit them. Teleportation is also used to extract others, and again there is uncertainty of who or what you would get.
