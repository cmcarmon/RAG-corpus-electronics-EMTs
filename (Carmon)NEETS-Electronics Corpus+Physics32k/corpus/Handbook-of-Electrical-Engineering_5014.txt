Dielectric materials comprise a variety of solids, liquids, and gases. The breakdown strength generally increases
with the density of the material so that dielectric solids tend to have higher dielectric strengths than gases. The
same tendency is observed also with the dielectric loss and permittivity; for example, the dielectric losses in
gases are virtually too small to be measurable and their dielectric constant in most practical applications can
be considered as unity. In this section we will describe a number of the more common insulating materials in use.
