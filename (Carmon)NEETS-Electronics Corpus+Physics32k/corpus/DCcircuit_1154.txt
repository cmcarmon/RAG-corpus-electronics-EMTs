A = 8155.27 square mils
However, electricians and others frequently concerned with wire size use another unit of
area measurement tailored speciﬁcally for wire’s circular cross-section. This special unit is
called the circular mil (sometimes abbreviated cmil). The sole purpose for having this special
unit of measurement is to eliminate the need to invoke the factor π (3.1415927 .
in
the formula for calculating area, plus the need to ﬁgure wire radius when you’ve been given
diameter. The formula for calculating the circular-mil area of a circular wire is very simple:
