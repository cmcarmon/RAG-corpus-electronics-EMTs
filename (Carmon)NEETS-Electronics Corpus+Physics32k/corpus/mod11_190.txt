The insertion of an element (ring) into the cavity slot, as shown in figure 2-37, increases the slot 
capacitance and decreases the resonant frequency. Because the gap is narrowed in width, the breakdown 
voltage is lowered. Therefore, capacitively tuned magnetrons must be operated with low voltages and at 
low-power outputs. The type of capacitive tuner illustrated in figure 2-37 is called a COOKIE-CUTTER 
TUNER. It consists of a metal ring inserted between the two rings of a double-strapped magnetron, which 
serves to increase the strap capacitance. Because of the mechanical and voltage breakdown problems 
associated with the cookie-cutter tuner, it is more suitable for use at longer wavelengths. Both the 
capacitance and inductance tuners described are symmetrical; that is, each cavity is affected in the same 
manner, and the pi mode is preserved.
