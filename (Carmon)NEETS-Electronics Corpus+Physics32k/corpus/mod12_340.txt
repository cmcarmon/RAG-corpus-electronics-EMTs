The time we have been referring to as the time of no pulse, or nonpulse time, is referred to as REST
TIME (rt). The duration of this rest time will determine certain capabilities of the pulse-modulation
system. The pulse width is the time that the transmitter produces rf oscillations and is the actual pulse
transmission time. During the nonpulse time, shown in figure 2-36, the transmitter produces no
oscillations and the oscillator is cut off.
