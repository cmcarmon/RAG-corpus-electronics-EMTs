As evident in the plot, airborne and space-based surveillance radar systems offer signiﬁcant advantages in
the detection of low-altitude targets that would otherwise be masked by earth curvature and terrain features
from surface-based radars. However, efﬁcient clutter rejection techniques must be used in order to detect targets
since surface clutter returns will be present at almost all ranges of interest.
