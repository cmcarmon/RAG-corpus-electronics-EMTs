The ELECTRON GUN consists of a HEATER and a CATHODE to generate electrons, a
CONTROL GRID to control brightness by controlling electron flow, and two ANODES (FIRST and
SECOND). The main purpose of the first (FOCUSING) anode is to focus the electrons into a narrow
beam on the screen. The second (ACCELERATING) anode accelerates the electrons as they pass. The
control grid is cylindrical and has a small opening in a baffle at one end. The anodes consist of two
cylinders that contain baffles (or plates) with small holes in their centers.
