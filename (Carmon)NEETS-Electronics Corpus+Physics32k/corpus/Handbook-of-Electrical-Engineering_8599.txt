The space for holding data and working on it in the CPU is the register set. Registers are a very important
resource. Bringing data in from memory is quite separate from any operations on that data. Data in memory
must ﬁrst be fetched, then acted upon. Data in registers can be acted on immediately. Thus, the availability of
registers  to  store  very  active  variables  and  intermediate  results  makes  a  processor  inherently  faster.  In  some
machines,  most  or  all  of  the  registers  are  tied  to  speciﬁc  uses.  The  most  prevalent  example  would  be  Intel’s
80x86  processors,  which  power  the  ubiquitous  PC.  Such  architectures,  however,  are  considered  quite  old-
fashioned. All of the machines that we are considering are of a type called general register machines in that they
have a large group of registers which may be used for any purpose. The machines that we include have either
16 or 32 registers, with only a few tied to speciﬁc machine operations.
