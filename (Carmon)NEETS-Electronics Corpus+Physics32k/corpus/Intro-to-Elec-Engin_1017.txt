Although the analysis here is carried out only for a three-phase case, it holds good for any q-
phase (q > 1; i.e., polyphase) winding excited by balanced q-phase currents when the respective
phases are wound 2π/q electrical radians apart in space. However, in a balanced two-phase case,
note that the two phase windings are displaced 90 electrical degrees in space, and the phase
currents in the two windings are phase-displaced by 90 electrical degrees in time. The constant
amplitude of the resultant rotating mmf can be shown to be q/2 times the maximum contribution
of any one phase. Neglecting the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, the corresponding ﬂux density
in the air gap of the machine is then given by
