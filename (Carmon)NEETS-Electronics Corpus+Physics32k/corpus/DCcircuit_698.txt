If a set of ”8 ohm” headphones are used for this purpose, its sensitivity may be greatly
increased by connecting it to a device called a transformer. The transformer exploits principles
of electromagnetism to ”transform” the voltage and current levels of electrical energy pulses.
In this case, the type of transformer used is a step-down transformer, and it converts low-
current pulses (created by closing and opening the pushbutton switch while connected to a
small voltage source) into higher-current pulses to more efﬁciently drive the speaker cones
inside the headphones. An ”audio output” transformer with an impedance ratio of 1000:8 is
ideal for this purpose. The transformer also increases detector sensitivity by accumulating
the energy of a low-current signal in a magnetic ﬁeld for sudden release into the headphone
speakers when the switch is opened. Thus, it will produce louder ”clicks” for detecting smaller
signals:
