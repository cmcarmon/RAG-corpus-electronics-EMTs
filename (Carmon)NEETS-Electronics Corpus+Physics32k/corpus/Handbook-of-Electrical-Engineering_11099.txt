Other clinical trials [Bentall, 1986] and animal experiments involved irradiation of wounds with pulsed high
and very high frequencies between 3 and 44 MHz, at power levels from 73 mW to 15 W, employing pulse widths
between 65 and 100 ms and pulse repetition frequencies between 200 Hz and 1 kHz. A commonly used animal
model for wound healing is the McFarlane skin ﬂap involving partial excision of a rectangular skin section on
the back of the rat. Survival of the ﬂap depends mainly on blood supply, with vascularization of the skin ﬂap
being  an  indirect  measure  of  treatment  success.  The  EBI  signal  shown  on  Fig.  113.33  (A  in  Table  113.2)  is
reported to have decreased skin ﬂap necrosis when exposure was for 6 h/day for 3 days, while exposure for 18
h on the ﬁrst day after injury had no observable effect [Luce and Bryant, 1986]. Exposure with a triangular,
symmetric  and  almost  continuous  magnetic  ﬁeld  (18-ms  triangular  pulse,  followed  by  2-ms  pause)  at  a
frequency of 50 Hz (8-mT peak to peak value) produced a signiﬁcant increase in wound contraction in rats
(in comparison with controls) who were exposed to the ﬁeld for 30 min immediately after surgery and for the
same period thereafter every 12 h. In an effort to determine what type of signals are most beneﬁcial for the
acceleration of wound healing, skin ﬂap necrosis was observed under exposure to sinusoidal magnetic ﬁelds at
constant ¶B/¶t of 0.5 T/s using frequencies of 20, 72, and 500-Hz [Sisken and Herbst, 1990]. While signals at
20 and 72 Hz signiﬁcantly decreased necrosis after 7 days, the 500-Hz signal was ineffective.
