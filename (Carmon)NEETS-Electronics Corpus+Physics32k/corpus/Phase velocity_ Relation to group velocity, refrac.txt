Since a pure sine wave cannot convey any information, some change in amplitude or frequency, known as modulation, is required. By combining two sines with slightly different frequencies and wavelengths,

{\displaystyle \cos[(k-\Delta k)x-(\omega -\Delta \omega )t]\;+\;\cos[(k+\Delta k)x-(\omega +\Delta \omega )t]=2\;\cos(\Delta kx-\Delta \omega t)\;\cos(kx-\omega t),}

the amplitude becomes a sinusoid with phase speed Δω/Δk. It is this modulation that represents the signal content. Since each amplitude envelope contains a group of internal waves, this speed is usually called the group velocity, vg.
In a given medium, the frequency is some function ω(k) of the wave number, so in general, the phase velocity vp = ω/k and the group velocity vg = dω/dk depend on the frequency and on the medium. The ratio between the speed of light c and the phase velocity vp is known as the refractive index, n = c/vp = ck/ω.
Taking the derivative of ω = ck/n with respect to k, yields the group velocity,

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\text{d}}\omega }{{\text{d}}k}}={\frac {c}{n}}-{\frac {ck}{n^{2}}}\cdot {\frac {{\text{d}}n}{{\text{d}}k}}~.}

Noting that c/n = vp, indicates that the group speed is equal to the phase speed only when the refractive index is a constant dn/dk = 0, and in this case the phase speed and group speed are independent of frequency, ω/k=dω/dk=c/n.
Otherwise, both the phase velocity and the group velocity vary with frequency, and the medium is called dispersive; the relation ω=ω(k) is known as the dispersion relation of the medium.
The phase velocity of electromagnetic radiation may – under certain circumstances (for example anomalous dispersion) – exceed the speed of light in a vacuum, but this does not indicate any superluminal information or energy transfer. It was theoretically described by physicists such as Arnold Sommerfeld and Léon Brillouin. See dispersion for a full discussion of wave velocities.
