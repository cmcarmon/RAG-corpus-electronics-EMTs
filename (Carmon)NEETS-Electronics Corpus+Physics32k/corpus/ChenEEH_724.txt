Costs in Highly Parallel Memory Architectures
The throughput can be enlarged by increasing the number of
bits being transferred per access. Different signals can be trans-
ferred from different memories. Moreover, multiport memories
can provide a higher memory bandwidth. The main problem
here is creating the parallelism and efﬁcient use of parallel data.
Increasing the number of memories has a positive inﬂuence
on both bandwidth and memory energy consumption. But the
interconnect complexity increases, causing higher costs. Obvi-
ously, there must be a trade-off. The deﬁnition of the memory
architecture and assignment of signals to these memories has a
large impact on the available bandwidth.
