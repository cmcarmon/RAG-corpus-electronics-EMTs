for all values of voltage and current. Resistors can be used to model processes
such as friction that result in energy loss in a system. Note that because this
element law is symmetric, it is unchanged if the polarities of the current and
voltage definitions are reversed. Sometimes it is convenient to work with recip-
rocal resistance, namely the conductance G having the units of Siemens (S). In
this case,
