Op-amps can also be used as active filters. Filters 
that use resistors, inductors, and capacitors are called 
passive filters. Active filters are inductorless fil-
ters using integrated circuits. The advantage of active 
filters is the absence of inductors, which is handy at 
low frequencies because of the size of inductors.
