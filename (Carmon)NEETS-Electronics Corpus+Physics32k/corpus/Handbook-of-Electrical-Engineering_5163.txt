Shape-memory hybrid composites are composite materials that contain SMA ﬁbers or ﬁlms in such a way
that they can be mechanically controlled by heat. These materials can be heated by passing a current through
the ﬁbers. SMHCs offer a wide scope of applications in material–structure interaction. The ﬁbers used in these
composites are also made of Nitinol alloys.
