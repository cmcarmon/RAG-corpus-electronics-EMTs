According to one principle of measurement (the principle used in the balanced bridge), the bridge is 
initially balanced with low-frequency bias power. Rf power is then applied to the bolometer and the bias 
power is gradually removed until the bridge is again balanced. The actual rf power is then equal to the 
bias power removed.
