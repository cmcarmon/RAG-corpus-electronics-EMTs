3.20 The Diode32
The resistor, capacitor, and inductor are linear circuit elements in that their v-i relations are linear in the
mathematical sense. Voltage and current sources are (technically) nonlinear devices: stated simply, doubling
the current through a voltage source does not double the voltage. A more blatant, and very useful, nonlinear
circuit element is the diode (learn more33). Its input-output relation has an exponential form.
