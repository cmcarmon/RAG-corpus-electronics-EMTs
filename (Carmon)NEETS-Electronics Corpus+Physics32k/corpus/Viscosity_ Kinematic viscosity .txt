The kinematic viscosity (also called "momentum diffusivity") is the ratio of the dynamic viscosity μ to the density of the fluid ρ. It is usually denoted by the Greek letter nu (ν) and has units

It is a convenient concept when analyzing the Reynolds number, which expresses the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} ={\frac {\rho uL}{\mu }}={\frac {uL}{\nu }},}

where L is a typical length scale in the system, and u is the velocity of the fluid with respect to the object (m/s).
