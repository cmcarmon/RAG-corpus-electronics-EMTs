The Optical Path
The optical path begins at the light source which, in practically
all  laser  disk  systems  in  use  today,  is  a  semiconductor  GaAs
diode laser. Several unique features have made the laser diode
indispensable in optical recording technology, not only for the
readout of stored information but also for writing and erasure.
The small size of this laser has made possible the construction
of  compact  head  assemblies,  its  coherence  properties  have
enabled diffraction-limited focusing to extremely small spots,
and its direct modulation capability has eliminated the need
for external modulators. The laser beam is modulated by con-
trolling  the  injection  current;  one  applies  pulses  of  variable
duration  to  turn  the  laser  on  and  off  during  the  recording
process. The pulse duration can be as short as a few nanosec-
onds, with rise and fall times typically less than 1 ns. Although
readout can be accomplished at constant power level, i.e., in
CW  mode,  it  is  customary  for  noise  reduction  purposes  to
modulate the laser at a high frequency (e.g., several hundred
megahertz during readout).
