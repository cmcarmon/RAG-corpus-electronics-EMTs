The DMM has several advantages over the ana-
log multimeter, including higher accuracy, digital 
readout, and repeatability of the reading. Unlike the 
VOM, the DMM uses very little current to test resis-
tances. This allows the testing of semiconductor junc-
tions. In fact, many DMMs have a special range for 
testing semiconductor junctions. These meters use 
approximately 1 mA of current through the junction 
under test.
