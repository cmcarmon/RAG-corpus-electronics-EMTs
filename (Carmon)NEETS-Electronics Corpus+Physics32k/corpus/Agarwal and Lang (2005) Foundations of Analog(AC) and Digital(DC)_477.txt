We now wish to translate these mathematical constraints to circuit
constraints,
to find simpler methods for analyzing multi-source networks.
Specifically, we wish to find the terms in Equation 3.102, by inspection, from
Figure 3.33. The mathematics says that, because of linearity, the first term
remains unchanged if the other two sources are set to zero. We must now inter-
pret this statement in circuit terms. Mathematically, we wish to set variable V2
to zero, so in circuit terms we must set voltage source V2 to zero. By definition,
source V2 must now be zero regardless of what current flows through it, that
is, it must be a short circuit. So in general, setting a voltage source to zero is
equivalent in circuit terms to replacing that source by a short circuit. Similarly,
setting I to zero means that no current can flow through that branch of the
circuit regardless of the terminal voltage. Hence setting a current source to zero
is equivalent in circuit terms to replacing that source by an open circuit. These
are two additional important circuit primitives. Applying these two concepts
to Figure 3.33, we can find the first term in Equation 3.102, that is, the part
of e1 arising from source V1, by forming a subcircuit from Figure 3.33 with V2
and I set to zero as shown in Figure 3.34a. Thus, in Figure 3.34a, e1A is the
voltage component of e1 due to source V1 acting alone. Now e1A can be found
by inspection using the voltage-divider primitive:
R2(cid:2)(R3 + R4)
