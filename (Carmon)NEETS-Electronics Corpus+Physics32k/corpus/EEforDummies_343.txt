Refer to Chapter 2 for information on buying these parts and Chapter 5 for 
details on resistors and potentiometers. You’ll need to attach wires to your 
potentiometer terminals so that you can connect the pot into your circuit. 
Refer to Chapter 15 for tips on attaching wires to pots and using a solderless 
breadboard. Because you will be measuring current, you may want to refer to 
Chapter 16 for details on how to use a multimeter.
