• fI(t): Nearly a VSB signal, when the DSB signal is ﬁltered by the BPF of passband 2–4.2
MHz to remove part of the USB in the DSB.
• fQ(t): DSB signal that is produced when the other chrominance signal modulates a quad-
rature-phase version of the color subcarrier. This DSB signal passes directly through the
BPF with passband 3–4.2 MHz without any change.
• fY(t): Filtered luminance signal of mY(t) by an LPF.
• fc(t): Composite baseband waveform by adding fY(t), fI(t), fQ(t), and sync pulses. This has
a bandwidth of about 4.2 MHz and modulates a visual carrier by standard AM.
