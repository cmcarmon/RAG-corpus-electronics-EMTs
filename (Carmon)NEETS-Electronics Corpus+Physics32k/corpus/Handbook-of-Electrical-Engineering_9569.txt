Knowledge Testing and Evaluation
Once the knowledge is encoded in the system, testing and evaluation need to be conducted. Veriﬁcation and
validation refers to checking for the consistency of the knowledge/logic and checking the quality/accuracy of
advice reached by the expert system. Various approaches to testing can be used, such as: performing “backcast-
ing”  by  running  the  expert  system  (using  a  representative  set  of  test  cases)  against  documented  cases  and
comparing the expert system-generated results with the historical results, using blind veriﬁcation tests (modiﬁed
Turing  test),  having  the  expert  and  other  experts  test  the  system,  using  statistical  methods  for  testing,  and
others. In evaluating the expert system, the users should evaluate the design of the human factors in the system
(i.e.,  instructions,  free-text  comments,  ease  of  updating,  exiting  capabilities,  response  time,  display  and  pre-
sentation of conclusions, ability to restart, ability for user to offer degree of certainty, graphics, utility of the
system, etc.).
