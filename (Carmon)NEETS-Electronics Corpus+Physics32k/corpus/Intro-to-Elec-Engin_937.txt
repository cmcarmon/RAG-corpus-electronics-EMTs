11.2.2 Now suppose an air gap 0.1 mm long is cut
in the right leg of the core of Figure 11.2.1(a),
making the magnetic circuit look like that of
Figure 11.2.1(b). Neglect leakage and fringing.
With the new core conÔ¨Åguration, repeat Problem
11.2.1 for the same dimensions and values given
in that problem. See what a difference that small
air gap can make!
