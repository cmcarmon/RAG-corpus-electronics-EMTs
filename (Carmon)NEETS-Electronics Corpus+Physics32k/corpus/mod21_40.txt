In today’s modern Navy, a large part of a ship’s, submarine’s, or aircraft’s ability to complete its
mission depends on the efficiency of sophisticated electronic systems. As the technician responsible for
these systems, you are the focal point in ensuring their reliability. In the event of a system failure, it is
your responsibility to repair the system and to do so in a timely manner. Whether you are troubleshooting
a faulty system or performing preventive maintenance, you are required to perform basic electronic
measurements on a regular basis. This chapter will acquaint you with various alternative methods of
performing measurements and discuss the relative merits and demerits of each method.
