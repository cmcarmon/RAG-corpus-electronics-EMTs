Excitation of string vibration is generally provided by a bow consisting of a flat ribbon of parallel horse hairs stretched between the ends of a stick, which may be made of wood or synthetic material such as fiberglass or carbon-fiber composite. The length, weight, and balance point of modern bows are standardized. Players may notice variations in sound and handling from bow to bow, based on these parameters as well as stiffness and moment of inertia.
The hair is coated with rosin to provide controlled stick-slip as it moves transversely to the string. Different types of rosin are available, providing varying amounts of "grip" or static friction.
In bowing, the three most prominent factors under the player's immediate control are bow speed, downward force, and location of the sounding point where hair crosses string. The desired sounding point will generally move closer to the bridge as the string is stopped to a shorter sounding length. The player may also vary the amount of hair in contact with the string by tilting the bow stick more or less away from the bridge. Violinists are trained to keep the bow perpendicular to the string in most cases, as other angles may adversely affect the sound.
