To be cleaver we will deﬁne one EMF in the circuit to have φ = 0. In other words, we
will pick t = 0 to be at the peak of one signal. The vector notation is used to remind us
that complex numbers can be considered as vectors in the complex plane. Although not so
common in physics, in electronics we refer to these vectors as phasors. Hence you should
now review complex notation.
