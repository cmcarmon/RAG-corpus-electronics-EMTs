Given the image degradation model in Figure 4.13, suppose
that x(m, n) and Z(m, n) are zero mean, stationary random
processes (Papoulis, 1984). The image restoration problem can
be formally stated as: given v(m, n), Ô¨Ånd the best estimate of
u(m, n) and ^uu(m, n) such that the mean squared estimation
error E[e2(m, n)] is minimum, where:
