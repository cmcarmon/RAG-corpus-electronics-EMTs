If A becomes inﬁnitely large, 1/A → 0, and the preceding expression reduces to−Rf /Ri,
obtained in part (a). Clearly as A → ∞, the inverting terminal voltage vn = −vo/A is
going to be very small, practically on the order of microvolts. Then it may be assumed
in the inverting ampliﬁer that vn is virtually zero, i.e., vn
