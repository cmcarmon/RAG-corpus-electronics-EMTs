The example (Figure 36-40) is a practical example 
of a real-world voltage divider. The voltage source is 
the standard AC power source of 120V AC that has 
been converted to 120V DC (assuming no loss for 
this discussion). What is desired is a voltage-divider 
network that will divide this 120V DC source into a 
lower-voltage source specified by the manufacturer of 
a particular device (radio, cassette player, CD player, 
etc.). Assume the desired voltage is 6 volts, and the 
load will draw 200 mA. The remaining voltage will be 
dissipated as heat. Keep in mind that it is necessary to 
know the load current for the voltage required for the 
device in advance.
