1.1
Electric  circuit  theory  and  electromagnetic  theory  are  the  two  funda-
mental  theories  upon  which  all  branches  of  electrical  engineering  are
built. Many branches of electrical engineering, such as power, electric
machines,  control,  electronics,  communications,  and  instrumentation,
are based on electric circuit theory. Therefore, the basic electric circuit
theory  course  is  the  most  important  course  for  an  electrical  engineer-
ing student, and always an excellent starting point for a beginning stu-
dent in electrical engineering education. Circuit theory is also valuable
to  students  specializing  in  other  branches  of  the  physical  sciences
because  circuits  are  a  good  model  for  the  study  of  energy  systems  in
general,  and  because  of  the  applied  mathematics,  physics,  and  topol-
ogy involved.
