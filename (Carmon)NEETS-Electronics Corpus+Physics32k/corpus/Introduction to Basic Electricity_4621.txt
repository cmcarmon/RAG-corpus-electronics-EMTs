Figure 45-26 shows a logic diagram of a half sub-
tractor. It has two inputs and generates a difference 
and a borrow output. The difference is generated by 
an XOR gate and the borrow output is generated by an 
AND gate with A and B inputs. The A is achieved by 
using an inverter on the variable A input.
