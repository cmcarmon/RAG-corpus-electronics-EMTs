Example 6.5 
 
The  following  data  was  obtained  during  a  test 
carried out on a d.c. power supply: 
 
(i) Load test 
Output voltage (no-load) = 12 V 
Output voltage (2 A load current) = 11.5 V 
 
(ii) Regulation test 
Output voltage (mains input, 220 V) = 12 V 
Output voltage (mains input, 200 V) = 11.9 V 
 
Determine  (a)  the  equivalent  output  resistance  of 
the  power  supply  and  (b)  the  regulation  of  the 
power supply. 
 
Solution 
 
The  output  resistance  can  be  determined  from  the 
load test data:
