Symmetry transformations in classical space and time
Each transformation can be described by an operator (i.e. function acting on the position r or momentum p variables to change them). The following are the cases when the operator does not change r or p, i.e. symmetries.

where R(n̂, θ) is the rotation matrix about an axis defined by the unit vector n̂ and angle θ.
Noether's theorem
Noether's theorem states that a continuous symmetry transformation of the action corresponds to a conservation law, i.e. the action (and hence the Lagrangian) doesn't change under a transformation parameterized by a parameter s:




L
[
q
(
s
,
t
)
,



q
˙



(
s
,
t
)
]
=
L
[
q
(
t
)
,



q
˙



(
t
)
]


{\displaystyle L[q(s,t),{\dot {q}}(s,t)]=L[q(t),{\dot {q}}(t)]}

the Lagrangian describes the same motion independent of s, which can be length, angle of rotation, or time. The corresponding momenta to q will be conserved.
