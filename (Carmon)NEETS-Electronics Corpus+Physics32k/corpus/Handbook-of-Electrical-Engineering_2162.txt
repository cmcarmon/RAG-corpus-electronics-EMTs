The RBF network is also a layered net with the hidden layer built from Gaussian kernels and a linear (or
nonlinear) output layer (Fig. 20.8). Training of the RBF network is done normally in two stages [Haykin, 1994]:
Ô¨Årst, the centers xi are adaptively placed in the input space using competitive learning or  k means clustering
[Bishop, 1995], which are unsupervised procedures. Competitive learning is explained later in the chapter. The
variances of each Gaussian are chosen as a percentage (30 to 50%) to the distance to the nearest center. The
goal is to cover adequately the input data distribution. Once the RBF is located, the second layer weights wi
are trained using the LMS procedure.
