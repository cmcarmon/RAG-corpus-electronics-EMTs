It is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula. For a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products, such as:




a

A
+
b

B
â†”
c

C
+
d

D


{\displaystyle a\,A+b\,B\leftrightarrow c\,C+d\,D}

the equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:





K

p


=




p

C


c




p

D


d





p

A


a




p

B


b







{\displaystyle K_{p}={\frac {p_{C}^{c}\,p_{D}^{d}}{p_{A}^{a}\,p_{B}^{b}}}}

For reversible reactions, changes in the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. However, the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.
