Cable Standards
The most universal standardizing authority for cables is the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
The IEC standards cater to a large variety of permissible options and serve mainly as a basis for the preparation
of national standards. In the United States, in addition to national standards for materials and components,
there are cable standards in widespread use by industry issued by four bodies: Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL),
Association of Edison Illuminating Companies (AEIC), and jointly by the Insulated Power Cables Engineers
Association and the National Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (IPCEA/NEMA).
