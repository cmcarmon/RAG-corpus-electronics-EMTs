▶✓ Use an antistatic wrist strap. 
Pictured in Figure 13-6, an anti-
static wrist strap grounds you 
and prevents static build‐up. It’s 
one of the most effective means 
of eliminating ESD, and it’s inex-
pensive (less than $10). To use 
one, roll up your shirt sleeves; 
remove all rings, watches, 
bracelets, and other metals; 
and wrap the strap around your 
wrist tightly. Then securely 
attach the clip from the wrist 
strap to a proper earth ground 
connection, which can be the 
bare (unpainted) surface of 
your computer case — with the 
computer plugged in — or simply the ground receptacle of a properly 
installed wall outlet. Be sure to review the instruction sheet that comes 
with the strap.
