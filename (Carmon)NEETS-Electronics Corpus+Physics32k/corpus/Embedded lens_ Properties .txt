In order to be an analytical solution of the Einstein's field equation, the embedded lens has to satisfy the following conditions:
The mass of the embedded lens (point mass or distributed), should be the same as that from the removed sphere.
The mass distribution within the void should be spherically symmetric.
The cosmological constant should be the same inside and outside of the embedded lens.
