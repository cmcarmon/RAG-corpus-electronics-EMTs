The evidence for QCD condensates comes from two eras, the pre-QCD era 1950â€“1973 and the post-QCD era, after 1974. The pre-QCD results established that the strong interactions vacuum contains a quark chiral condensate, while the post-QCD results established that the vacuum also contains a gluon condensate.
