Calculating voltage across a component
In the circuit that was shown in Figure 6-1, the voltage across the resistor is 
simply the voltage supplied by the battery: 9 V. That’s because the resistor is 
the only circuit element other than the battery. Adding a second resistor in 
series (refer to Figure 6-2) changes the voltage picture. Now some of the bat-
tery voltage is dropped across the 220 Ω resistor (R1), and the rest of the bat-
tery voltage is dropped across the 1 kΩ resistor (R2). I labeled these voltages 
V1 and V2, respectively.
