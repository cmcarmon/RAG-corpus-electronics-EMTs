Note that since the force in this case is proportional not to P0 but to kP0, a ribbon microphone (which like a
moving  coil  microphone  is  electrodynamic)  will  have  ï¬‚at  receiving  sensitivity  when  its  impedance  is  mass
controlled.  By  combining  a  dipole  receiver  with  a  monopole  receiver  one  obtains  a  unidirectional  cardioid
receiver with
