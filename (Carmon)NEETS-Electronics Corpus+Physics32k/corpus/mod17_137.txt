The NORATS meets our need for a connection between Navy tactical voice systems of the operating 
forces and the various fixed telephone services ashore. This system extends tactical voice to shore-based 
operational commands. NORATS provides a connecting point in the fleet center of each communication 
station. This point allows us to connect or patch all ship-to-shore voice circuits and designated local shore 
telephone systems and extensions. A combined HICOM/NORATS console exists at many naval 
communications stations.
