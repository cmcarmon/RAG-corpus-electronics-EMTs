An acoustic cloak is a hypothetical device that would make objects impervious towards sound waves. This could be used to build sound proof homes, advanced concert halls, or stealth warships. The mathematics and physics behind acoustic cloaking has been known for several years. The idea of acoustic cloaking is to deviate the sounds waves around the object that has to be cloaked. But realizing it in materials has been difficult, since mechanical metamaterials are needed. The key to this problem are acoustic metamaterials also known as "Sonic Crystals". Making a metamaterial for sound means identifying the acoustic analogues to permittivity and permeability in light waves. It turns out that these are the material's mass density and its elastic constant. Researchers from Wuhan University, China in a paper in 2007 reported such a metamaterial which simultaneously possessed a negative bulk modulus and mass density.
