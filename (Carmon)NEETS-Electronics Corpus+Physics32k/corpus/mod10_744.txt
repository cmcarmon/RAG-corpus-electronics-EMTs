The Yagi antenna shown in figure 4-32, view A, has three directors. In general, the greater number 
of parasitic elements used, the greater the gain. However, a greater number of such elements causes the 
array to have a narrower frequency response as well as a narrower beamwidth. Therefore, proper 
adjustment of the antenna is critical. The gain does not increase directly with the number of elements 
used. For example, a three-element Yagi array has a relative power gain of 5 dB. Adding another director 
results in a 2 dB increase. Additional directors have less and less effect.
