Step 2: The 1.56- step is cut out, leaving a total resistance of 3.12 âˆ’ 1.56 = 1.56  in the
armature circuit. The initial motor speed at this step is 265.7 r/min, which means that the counter
emf is still 114.56 V, if the effect of armature reaction is neglected. Accordingly, the resistance
drop in the armature circuit is still 115.44 V, so that
