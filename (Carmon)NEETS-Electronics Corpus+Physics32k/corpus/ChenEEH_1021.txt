The terms power consumption and energy consumption are
often interchanged. It is important to distinguish between the
two especially in the context of mobile applications. Mobile
systems run on the limited energy available in a battery. The
energy consumed by the system determines the length of the
battery life, so the reduction in the energy consumed by exe-
cuting systemâ€™s tasks is necessary.
