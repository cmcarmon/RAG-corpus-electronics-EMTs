INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC)Â—(1) A circuit in which many elements are fabricated and interconnected 
by a single process (into a single chip), as opposed to a "nonintegrated" circuit in which the transistors, 
diodes, resistors, and other components are fabricated separately and then assembled [7]. (2) Elements 
inseparably associated and formed on or within a single substrate [14].
