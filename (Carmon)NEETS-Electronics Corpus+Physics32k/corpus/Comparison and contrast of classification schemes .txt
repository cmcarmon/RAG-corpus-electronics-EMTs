Using one or more classification schemes for the classification of a collection of objects has many benefits. Some of these include:
It allows a user to find an individual object quickly on the basis of its kind or group.
It makes it easier to detect duplicate objects.
It conveys semantics (meaning) of an object from the definition of its kind, which meaning is not conveyed by the name of the individual object or its way of spelling.
Knowledge and requirements about a kind of thing can be applied to the members of the kind.
