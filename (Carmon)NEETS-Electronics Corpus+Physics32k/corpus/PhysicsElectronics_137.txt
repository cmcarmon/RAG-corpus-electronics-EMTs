Inductors are never pure inductances because there is always some resistance in
and some capacitance between the coil windings. When choosing an inductor
(occasionally called a choke) for a speciÔ¨Åc application, it is necessary to consider
the value of the inductance, the DC resistance of the coil, the current-carrying
capacity of the coil windings, the breakdown voltage between the coil and the
frame, and the frequency range in which the coil is designed to operate. To
obtain a very high inductance it is necessary to have a coil of many turns. The
inductance can be further increased by winding the coil on a closed-loop iron or
ferrite core. To obtain as pure an inductance as possible, the DC resistance of
the windings should be reduced to a minimum. This can be done by increasing
the wire size, which of course, increases the size of the choke. The size of the wire
also determines the current-handling capacity of the choke since the work done
in forcing a current through a resistance is converted to heat in the resistance.
Magnetic losses in an iron core also account for some heating, and this heating
restricts any choke to a certain safe operating current. The windings of the coil
must be insulated from the frame as well as from each other. Heavier insulation,
which necessarily makes the choke more bulky, is used in applications where
there will be a high voltage between the frame and the winding. The losses
sustained in the iron core increases as the frequency increases. Large inductors,
rated in henries, are used principally in power applications. The frequency in
these circuits is relatively low, generally 60 Hz or low multiples thereof. In high-
frequency circuits, such as those found in FM radios and television sets, very
small inductors (of the order of microhenries) are frequently used.
