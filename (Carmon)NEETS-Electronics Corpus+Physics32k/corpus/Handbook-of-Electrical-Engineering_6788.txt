The CCS7 signaling network provides the underlying foundation for the intelligent network, and the regional
telephone companies in the United States began wide-scale deployment of these networks in 1986; several large
independent telephone companies and interexchange carriers (ICs) soon followed. They used these networks
for both trunk signaling between switches as well as for direct signaling from a switch to a database.
