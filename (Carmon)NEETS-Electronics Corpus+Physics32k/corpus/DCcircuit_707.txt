As is the case with extending a meter movement’s voltage-measuring ability, we would have
to correspondingly re-label the movement’s scale so that it read differently for an extended
current range. For example, if we wanted to design an ammeter to have a full-scale range of
5 amps using the same meter movement as before (having an intrinsic full-scale range of only
1 mA), we would have to re-label the movement’s scale to read 0 A on the far left and 5 A on
the far right, rather than 0 mA to 1 mA as before. Whatever extended range provided by the
parallel-connected resistors, we would have to represent graphically on the meter movement
face.
