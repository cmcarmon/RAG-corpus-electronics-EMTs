for some value of the constant k. Thus, the further from the transmitter the receiver is located, the weaker
the received signal. Whereas the attenuation found in wireline channels can be controlled by physical
parameters and choice of transmission frequency, the inverse-distance attenuation found in wireless channels
persists across all frequencies.
