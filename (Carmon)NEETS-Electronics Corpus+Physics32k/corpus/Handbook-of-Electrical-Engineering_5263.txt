Hydrogenerators.
The hydrogenerator is a low-speed (100 to 360 rpm) salient-pole machine with a vertical
shaft. A typical number of poles is from 20 to 72. They are mounted on a pole spider, which is a welded, spoked
wheel.  The  spider  is  mounted  on  the  forged  steel  shaft.  The  poles  are  built  with  a  laminated  iron  core  and
stranded copper winding. Damper bars are built in the pole faces. The stator is built with slotted, laminated
iron  core  that  is  supported  by  a  welded  steel  frame.  Windings  are  made  of  stranded  conductors  insulated
between the turns by Ô¨Åberglass or Dacron-glass. The ground insulation is multiple layers of mica tape impreg-
nated by epoxy or polyester resins. The older machines use asphalt and mica tape insulation, which is sensitive
to corona-discharge-caused insulation deterioration. Direct water cooling is used for very large machines, while
the smaller ones are air- or hydrogen-cooled. Some machines use forced-air cooling with an air-to-water heat
exchanger. A braking system is installed in larger machines to stop the generator rapidly and to avoid damage
to the thrust.
