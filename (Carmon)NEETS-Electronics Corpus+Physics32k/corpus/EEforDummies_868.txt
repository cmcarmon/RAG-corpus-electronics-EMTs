You can make your own workbench easily by using an old door as a table sur-
face. If you don’t have an old door lying around the house, pick up an inex-
pensive hollow‐core door or a sturdier solid‐core door at your local home 
improvement store. Build legs using 30‐inch lengths of 2‐by‐4 lumber and 
attach the legs using joist hangers. As an alternative, you can use 3/4‐inch 
plywood or particle board to fashion your work surface.
