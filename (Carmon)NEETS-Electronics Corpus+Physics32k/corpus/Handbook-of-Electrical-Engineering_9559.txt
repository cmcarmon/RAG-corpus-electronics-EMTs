The development of rule-based systems is typically called knowledge engineering. The knowledge engineer
is the individual involved in the development and deployment of the expert system. Knowledge engineering,
in rule-based systems, refers primarily to the construction of the knowledge base. As such, there are six major
steps in this process, namely (1) problem selection, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) knowledge representation,
(4) knowledge encoding, (5) knowledge testing and evaluation, and (6) implementation and maintenance. The
knowledge engineering process typically uses a rapid prototyping approach (build a little, test a little). Each of
the six steps in the knowledge engineering process will be brieï¬‚y discussed in turn.
