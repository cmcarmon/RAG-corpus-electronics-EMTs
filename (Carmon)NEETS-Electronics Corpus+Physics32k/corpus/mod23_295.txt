There are many ways to measure flutter. Most are based on the fact that tape speed variations cause
frequency modulation of a recorded tone. Figure 6-8 shows a typical setup for measuring the peak-to-peak
value of flutter with a frequency-modulation (FM) demodulator and an oscilloscope. The technical
manual for the magnetic tape recorder youâ€™re testing will tell you how to set up the signal generator to
output the test signal. After setting up the test equipment, follow these procedures:
