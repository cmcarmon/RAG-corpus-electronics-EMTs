In other words, a necessary condition for obtaining the linear
MMSE estimate is the uncorrelatedness between the estima-
tion error and the observed random variables. In the context of
vector space, equation 6.13 is the well-known orthogonality
principle. Intuitively, the equation states that the linear MMSE
estimate of S is the projection of S onto the subspace spanned
by the set of random variables {Xi}. In this framework, the
norm of the vector space is the mean-square value while the
inner product between two vectors is the correlation between
two random variables.
