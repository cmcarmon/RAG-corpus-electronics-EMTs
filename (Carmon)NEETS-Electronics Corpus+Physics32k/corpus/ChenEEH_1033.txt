Memory Design Techniques
Memory design techniques techniques are mainly focused on
reducing the power consumed by memories, such as creatively
exploiting caching to reduce power consumption (Pedram and
Rabaey, 2002). Increasing memory blocks on-chip can reduce
the overall power consumption of a processor because the
power dissipation of an external memory access is at least an
order of magnitude higher than that of an on-chip access (Ko
et al., 1998). The discrepancy is due mainly to the relatively
large capacitive overhead in driving device I/O, board traces,
and discrete memory components. For optimizing internal
memories, Lee and Tiwari (1996) analyze memory allocation
of variables in embedded DSP software to maximize simulta-
neous data transfers from different memory banks to registers.
A memory allocation technique based on simulated annealing
is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that energy
reduction of up to 47% can be achieved using this approach.
In work by Wen-Tsong et al. (1999), a relation between energy
consumption and cache design (i.e., cache size, line size, set
associativity, and tiling) is established.
