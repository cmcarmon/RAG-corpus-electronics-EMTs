Receiver sensitivity, bandwidth, and dynamic range are key operational parameters used to define
receiver performance. One goal in designing fiber optic receivers is to optimize receiver sensitivity. To
increase sensitivity, receiver noise resulting from signal-dependent shot noise and thermal noise must be
kept at a minimum. A more detailed discussion of receiver shot and thermal noise is provided later in this
chapter.
