The actuator arm assembly positions the magnetic heads over the recording surface of the floppy 
disk. It does this by using a special type of dc motor called a stepper motor. This motor, which can be 
moved in very small steps, allows the read/write heads to be moved from track to track as needed to write 
data onto and read data off of the floppy disk.
