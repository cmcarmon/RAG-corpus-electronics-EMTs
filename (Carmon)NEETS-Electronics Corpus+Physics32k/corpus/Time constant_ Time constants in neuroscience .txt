In an action potential (or even in a passive spread of signal) in a neuron, the time constant



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is




τ
=

r

m



c

m




{\displaystyle \tau =r_{m}c_{m}}

where rm is the resistance across the membrane and cm is the capacitance of the membrane.
The resistance across the membrane is a function of the number of open ion channels and the capacitance is a function of the properties of the lipid bilayer.
The time constant is used to describe the rise and fall of membrane voltage, where the rise is described by




V

t
)

V

(

)


{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{\textrm {max}}(1-e^{-t/\tau })}

and the fall is described by

e

−
t

/

τ




{\displaystyle V(t)=V_{\textrm {max}}e^{-t/\tau }}

where voltage is in millivolts, time is in seconds, and



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is in seconds.
Vmax is defined as the maximum voltage attained in the action potential, where





V

=

m


I


{\displaystyle V_{\textrm {max}}=r_{m}I}

where rm is the resistance across the membrane and I is the current.
Setting for t =



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
for the rise sets V(t) equal to 0.63Vmax. This means that the time constant is the time elapsed after 63% of Vmax has been reached
Setting for t =



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
for the fall sets V(t) equal to 0.37Vmax, meaning that the time constant is the time elapsed after it has fallen to 37% of Vmax.
The larger a time constant is, the slower the rise or fall of the potential of a neuron. A long time constant can result in temporal summation, or the algebraic summation of repeated potentials. A short time constant rather produces a coincidence detector through spatial summation.
