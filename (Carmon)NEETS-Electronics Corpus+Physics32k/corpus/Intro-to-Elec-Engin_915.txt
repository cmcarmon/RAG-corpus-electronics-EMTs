(b) The corresponding phasor diagram is shown in Figure E11.4.1(b).
(c) The equivalent circuit of the transformer, along with the feeder impedance, referred to the
high-voltage side, neglecting the exciting current of the transformer, is shown in Figure
E11.4.1(c). The total series impedance is (0.5+ j2.0)+ (1.5+ j2.0) = 2+ j4 . Using
KVL,
