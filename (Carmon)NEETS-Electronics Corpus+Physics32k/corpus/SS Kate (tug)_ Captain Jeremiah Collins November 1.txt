On 12 March 1906 the brothers, William Edward and Peter Henry Dessaix were anchored off Pine Point in Middle Harbour, at about 7.15 a.m. in the skiff Toreador they saw the steam launch Kate, with a powder barge in tow, coming from the powder hulks in the direction of the open harbour. The launch got within two or three lengths of the skiff, and as the brothers Dessaix saw that she was not altering her course, Peter Dessaix called out, 'Look out! Alter your course, or we will be run down.' At this time, so the brothers say, there was no one at the wheel of the Kate. Again and again Peter yelled out, and then someone rushed to the wheel, and attempted to alter the course
The Kate, almost immediately struck the skiff on the bow, and the powder barge coming along also hit the boat. The brother went overboard, and the collision bloke the bow of the boat, which half-filled
During the marine court of inquiry into the collision with the skiff Toreador shortly after the evidence had been opened a point arose as to whether the Court had jurisdiction to hold tho inquiry as "nothing in this Act shall apply to any ship belonging to or in the service of the crown" and the Kate was a ship within the meaning of that section and additionally as the Toreador was a skiff and was propelled by oars it was not a ship within the meaning of the Act causing the inquiry to close
The Explosives Department budget for 1 July 1910, to 30 June 1911 also show that Captain Collins wage increased from £168 to £174 per annum
On 25 May 1911 there were a hundred or so of passengers on board the tourist steamer Kookaburra owned by Sydney ferries late in the afternoon when the vessel was between the Bluff and Green Point Middle Harbour in close proximity to the powder hulks. The passengers became aware that something was wrong, it became known that a fire had broken out just over the boiler. In a short space of time many small boats were around the Kookaburra the steam launch Kate moored close by was the first to make fast alongside and the crew of the Kate to assist in extinguishing the flames.
