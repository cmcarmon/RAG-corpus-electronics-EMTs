Exergy of a system is the maximum useful work possible during a process that brings the system into equilibrium with a heat reservoir. Wall  clearly states the relation between exergy analysis and resource accounting. This intuition confirmed by DeWulf  Sciubba  lead to exergo-economic accounting  and to methods specifically dedicated to LCA such as exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS). The concept of material input per unit of service (MIPS) is quantified in terms of the second law of thermodynamics, allowing the calculation of both resource input and service output in exergy terms. This exergetic material input per unit of service (EMIPS) has been elaborated for transport technology. The service not only takes into account the total mass to be transported and the total distance, but also the mass per single transport and the delivery time. The applicability of the EMIPS methodology relates specifically to transport system and allows an effective coupling with Life Cycle Assessment.
