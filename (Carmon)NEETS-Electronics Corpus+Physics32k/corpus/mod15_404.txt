The stator of this step motor has six field coils spaced 60 degrees apart. The coils are connected in
three groups of two coils each, with opposite coils connected in series. One end of each pair of coils is
connected to one of the brushes in the step transmitter. The other ends of the coils are connected to the
other side of the dc supply voltage through a common lead. As the rotor of the step transmitter is turned,
the corresponding coils in the step motor are energized in sequence, producing a rotating step-by-step
stator field. Thus, the motor rotates in abrupt increments or steps rather than smoothly.
