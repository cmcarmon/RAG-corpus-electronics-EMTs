It is important physically that in general



U
(
⋅
)


{\displaystyle U(\cdot )}
does not have to be an ordinary representation of



G


{\displaystyle G}
; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of



U
(
g
)


{\displaystyle U(g)}
to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on





R


3




{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}}
with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of




S
O
(
3
)



{\displaystyle \mathrm {SO(3)} }
on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of




S
O
(
3
)



{\displaystyle \mathrm {SO(3)} }
. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover




S
U
(
2
)



{\displaystyle \mathrm {SU(2)} }
of




S
O
(
3
)



{\displaystyle \mathrm {SO(3)} }
on spinor space.
For many interesting classes of groups



G


{\displaystyle G}
, Bargmann's theorem tells us that every projective unitary representation of



G


{\displaystyle G}
comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
of



G


{\displaystyle G}
. Actually, if





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group



G


{\displaystyle G}
, every projective unitary representation of



G


{\displaystyle G}
comes from an ordinary unitary representation of






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
. If





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on



G


{\displaystyle G}
(see below). In this setting the result is a theorem of Bargmann. Fortunately, the crucial case of the Poincaré group, Bargmann's theorem applies. (See Wigner's classification of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincaré group.)
The requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the second cohomology group of





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a discrete group. But extensions of



G


{\displaystyle G}
by a discrete group are nothing but a covers of



G


{\displaystyle G}
. For instance, the universal cover






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
is related to



G


{\displaystyle G}
through the quotient



G
≈



G
~




/

Γ


{\displaystyle G\approx {\tilde {G}}/\Gamma }
with the central subgroup



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
being the center of






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
itself, isomorphic to the fundamental group of the covered group.
Thus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
of the symmetry group



G


{\displaystyle G}
. This is desirable because





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
is much easier to work with than the non-vector space




P



H




{\displaystyle \mathrm {P} {\mathcal {H}}}
. If the representations of






G
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {G}}}
can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of





H




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
are available.
