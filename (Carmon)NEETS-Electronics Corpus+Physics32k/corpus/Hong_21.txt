Resistors  are  the  most  simple  and  most  commonly  used  electronic  component. 
Resistors have a linear current-voltage relationship as stated by Ohm’s law. The unit of 
resistance  is  an  ohm,  which  is  represented  by  the  letter  omega  (Ω).  Common  resistor 
values range from 1 Ω to 22 MΩ.
