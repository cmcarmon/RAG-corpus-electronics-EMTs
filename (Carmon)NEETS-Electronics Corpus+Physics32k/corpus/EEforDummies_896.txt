Don’t apply a lubricant unless you know for sure that a mechanical part 
needs it. Certain self‐lubricating plastics used for mechanical components 
can break down when exposed to petroleum‐based lubricants. If you’re fixing 
a CD player or other piece of electronic equipment, check with the manufac-
turer for instructions regarding use of lubrication.
