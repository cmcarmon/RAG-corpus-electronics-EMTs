Domain walls form in order to minimize the magnetic energy of the sample. The magnetic energy is mH 2/8p
cgs units or 1/2 m H2 J/m3 (SI units) and clearly depends on H, the magnetic ﬁeld emanating from the sample.
In the initial domain conﬁguration shown in Fig. 36.6, there is no net magnetization of the sample and thus
no  substantial  H  exists  outside  the  sample  and  the  magnetostatic  energy  is  zero.  Thus,  the  establishment  of
domains  reduces  the  energy  associated  with  H  but  it  increases  the  energy  needed  to  establish  domain  walls
within the sample. A compromise is reached in which domain walls are formed until the establishment of one
more wall would increase, rather than decrease, the total magnetic energy of the sample.
