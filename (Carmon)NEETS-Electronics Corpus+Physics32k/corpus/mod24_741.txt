Trade-offs are made in APD design to optimize responsivity and gain, dark current, response time,
and linearity. This chapter does not attempt to discuss trade-offs in APD design in more detail. Many
aspects of the discussion provided on responsivity, dark current, and response time provided in the PIN
photodiodes section also relate to APDs. The response time of an APD and its output circuitry depends on
the same factors as PIN photodiodes. The only additional factor affecting the response time of an APD is
the additional time required to complete the process of avalanche multiplication. To learn more about
APD design trade-offs and performance parameters, refer to the reference material listed in appendix 2.
