The current and future power semiconductor devices developmental direction is shown in Fig. 30.8. High
temperature operation capability and low forward voltage drop operation can be obtained if silicon is replaced
by silicon carbide material for producing power devices. The silicon carbide has a higher band gap than silicon.
Hence higher breakdown voltage devices could be developed. Silicon carbide devices have excellent switching
characteristics and stable blocking voltages at higher temperatures. But the silicon carbide devices are still in
the very early stages of development.
