However, notice from Equations 14.78 and 14.79 that the sum of the inductor
and capacitor voltages is zero. Thus, the combination of the two elements
appears as a short. Any solace one obtains from this fact, however, should
be short lived because for high Q resonant circuits, the capacitor or inductor
voltage can still be massive, and can damage an element if its voltage rating is
exceeded.5 On a more positive note, this principle is used in instruments for
measuring the Q of inductors.
