In figure 3-23 a positive-going trigger pulse has been applied to input 1. The flip-flop has now 
changed states; Q1 is cut off and Q2 is saturated. If a second positive-going trigger pulse is applied to 
input 1, it has no effect. This is because Q1 is already cut off; therefore, a positive pulse on its base has no 
effect. But if a positive-going trigger pulse were applied to input 2, the flip-flop would change back to its 
original state as shown in figure 3-24.
