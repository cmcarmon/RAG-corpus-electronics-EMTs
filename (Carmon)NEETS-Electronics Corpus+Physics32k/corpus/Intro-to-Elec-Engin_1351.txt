Due to the high level of noise at high-frequency components of the message in FM, it is
desirable to attenuate the high-frequency components of the demodulated signal. This results in
a reduction in the noise level, but causes the higher frequency components of the message signal
to be attenuated also. In order to compensate for the attenuation of the higher components of the
message signal, one can amplify these components at the transmitter before modulation. Thus, at
the transmitter we need a high-pass ﬁlter, and at the receiver we must use a low-pass ﬁlter. The
net effect of these ﬁlters is to have a ﬂat frequency response. The receiver ﬁlter should therefore
be the inverse of the transmitter ﬁlter. The modulator ﬁlter, which emphasizes high frequencies,
is called the preemphasis ﬁlter, and the demodulator ﬁlter, which is the inverse of the modulator
ﬁlter, is called the deemphasis ﬁlter.
