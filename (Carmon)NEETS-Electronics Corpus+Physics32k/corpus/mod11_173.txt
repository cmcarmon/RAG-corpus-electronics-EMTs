The equivalent electrical circuit of the hole and slot is shown in figure 2-29B. The parallel sides of 
the slot form the plates of a capacitor while the walls of the hole act as an inductor. The hole and slot thus 
form a high-Q, resonant LC circuit. As shown in figure 2-27, the anode of a magnetron has a number of 
these cavities.
