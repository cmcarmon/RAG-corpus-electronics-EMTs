Monte Carlo simulation: A technique for simulating systems that contain signal sources producing stochastic
or random signals. The signal sources are modeled by pseudorandom generators. Performance measures,
such as the symbol error rate, are then estimated by time averages. This is a general-purpose technique
that  can  be  applied  to  an  extremely  wide  range  of  systems.  It  can,  however,  require  large  amounts  of
computer time to generate accurate estimates.
