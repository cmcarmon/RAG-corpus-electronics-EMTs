—The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there
are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon-12. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be speciﬁed
and  may  be  atoms,  molecules,  ions,  electrons,  or  other  particles,  or  speciﬁed  groups  of  such  particles  (14th
CGPM, 1971).
