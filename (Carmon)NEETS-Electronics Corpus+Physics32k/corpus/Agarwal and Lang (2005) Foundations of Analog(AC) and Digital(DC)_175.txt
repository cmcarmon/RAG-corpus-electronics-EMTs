As we saw previously, the process of discretization can be viewed as a way
of modeling physical systems. For example, the resistor is a lumped model
for a lightbulb. Modeling physical systems is a major motivation for studying
electronic circuits. In our lightbulb circuit example, we used lumped electrical
elements to model electrical components such as bulbs and batteries. In general,
modeling physical systems involves representing real-world physical processes,
whether they are electrical, chemical, or mechanical, in terms of a set of ideal
electrical elements. This section introduces a set of ideal two-terminal elements
including voltage and current sources, and ideal wires and resistors, which form
our primitives in the vocabulary of circuits.
