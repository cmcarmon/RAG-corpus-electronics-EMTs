Capacitors in parallel
Figure 7‚Äê6 shows two capacitors in parallel, with the common connection 
points labeled A and B. Note that point A is connected to one plate of capaci-
tor C1 and one plate of capacitor C2. Electrically speaking, point A is con-
nected to a metal plate that is the size of the two plates combined. Likewise 
for point B, which is connected to both the other plate of capacitor C1 and 
the other plate of capacitor C2. The larger the surface area of a capacitor 
plate, the larger the capacitance.
