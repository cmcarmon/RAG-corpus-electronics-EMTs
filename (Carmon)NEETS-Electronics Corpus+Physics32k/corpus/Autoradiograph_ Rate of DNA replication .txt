The rate of DNA replication in a mouse cell growing in vitro was measured by autoradiography as 33 nucleotides per second. The rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected E. coli was also measured by autoradiography as 749 nucleotides per second during the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 Â°C.
