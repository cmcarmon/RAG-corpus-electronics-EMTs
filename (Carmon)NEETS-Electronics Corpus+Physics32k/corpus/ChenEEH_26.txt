Analysis of an electrical circuit involves the determination
of voltages and currents in various elements, given the element
values and their interconnections. In a linear circuit, the v–i
relations of the circuit elements and the equations generated
by the application of KCL at the nodes and of KVL for the
loops generate a sufﬁcient number of simultaneous linear
equations that can be solved for unknown voltages and cur-
rents. Various steps involved in the analysis of linear circuits
are as follows:
