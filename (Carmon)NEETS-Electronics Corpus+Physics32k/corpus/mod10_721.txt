The major lobe or lobes occur along the axis of the array. The pattern is sharper in the plane that is at 
right angles to the plane containing the elements (figure 4-29, view A). If the elements are not exact 
half-wave dipoles, operation is not significantly affected. However, because of the required balance of 
phase relationships and critical feeding, the array must be symmetrical. Folded dipoles, such as the one 
shown in figure 4-20, view A, are used frequently because the impedance at their terminals is higher. This 
is an effective way of avoiding excessive antenna losses. Another expedient to reduce losses is the use of 
tubular elements of wide diameter.
