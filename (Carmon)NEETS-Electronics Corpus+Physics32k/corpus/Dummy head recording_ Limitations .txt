The main focus of recording with a dummy head is to achieve a perfect binaural playback that is suited to all listeners. The problem arises that each human head has different shaped and sized features. Due to the diversity in HRTFs it is impossible to create a binaural effect compatible for everyoneâ€™s ears. Therefore the simulated dummy head recording algorithm uses average HRTFs to create a moderate binaural effect for everyone.
