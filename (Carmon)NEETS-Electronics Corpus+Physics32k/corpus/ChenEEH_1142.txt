Another very different optical display might be enabled by
the small size and high performance of MEMS actuators.
Figure 6.14 is a photograph of a prototype display integrated
into a pair of eyeglasses. The video signal fed to the left ear-
piece produces a very small image that can be viewed by
looking at the small mirror mounted in the center of the left
lens. The wearer can look at the world in a normal manner
through most of the lens or view dynamic colored images by
looking at the mirror on the one lens. A two-dimensional
MEMS scanning micromirror is a candidate technology for
production of the image. This approach to a ‘‘heads-up dis-
play’’ is substantially lighter than its competitors. Repair per-
sonnel could view manuals while working on a system such
as an automobile. Voice activation would be used for turning
pages and enlarging the images of diagrams.
