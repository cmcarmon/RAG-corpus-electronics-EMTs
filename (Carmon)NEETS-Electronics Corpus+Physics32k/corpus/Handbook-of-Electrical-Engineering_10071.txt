Brief Introduction to ArtiÔ¨Åcial Neural Networks
Increasing interest in studying the mechanisms and structure of the brain has led to the development of new
computational  models  for  solving  problems  such  as  pattern  recognition,  fast  information  processing,  and
adaptation. In the 1940s, McCulloch and Pitts studied the potential and capabilities of the interconnection of
components  based  on  a  model  of  a  biological  neuron.  Since  then,  many  different  models  and  architectures
have  been  developed  and  analyzed  for  a  variety  of  applications  [Zurada,  1992].  One  of  the  most  common
neuron models is shown in Fig. 100.57.
