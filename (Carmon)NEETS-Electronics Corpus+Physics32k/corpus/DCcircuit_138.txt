Power is a measure of how much work can be performed in a given amount of time. Work is
generally deÔ¨Åned in terms of the lifting of a weight against the pull of gravity. The heavier the
weight and/or the higher it is lifted, the more work has been done. Power is a measure of how
rapidly a standard amount of work is done.
