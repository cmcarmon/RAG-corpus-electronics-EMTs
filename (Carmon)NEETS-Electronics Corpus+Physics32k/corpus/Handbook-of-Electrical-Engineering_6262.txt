• Translator:  A low-power system that rebroadcasts the signal of another station on a different channel.
Translators are designed to provide “ﬁll-in” coverage for a station that cannot reach a particular com-
munity because of the local terrain. Translators operating in the VHF band are limited to 100 W power
output (ERP), and UHF translators are limited to 1 kW.
