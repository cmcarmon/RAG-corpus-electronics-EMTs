Often in physics the dimensions of a massive object can be ignored and can be treated as a pointlike object, i.e. a point particle. Point particles with electric charge are referred to as point charges. Two point charges, one with charge +q and the other one with charge âˆ’q separated by a distance d, constitute an electric dipole (a special case of an electric multipole). For this case, the electric dipole moment has a magnitude




p
=
q
d


{\displaystyle p=qd}

and is directed from the negative charge to the positive one. Some authors may split d in half and use s = d/2 since this quantity is the distance between either charge and the center of the dipole, leading to a factor of two in the definition.
A stronger mathematical definition is to use vector algebra, since a quantity with magnitude and direction, like the dipole moment of two point charges, can be expressed in vector form





p

=
q

d



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =q\mathbf {d} }

where d is the displacement vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge. The electric dipole moment vector p also points from the negative charge to the positive charge.
An idealization of this two-charge system is the electrical point dipole consisting of two (infinite) charges only infinitesimally separated, but with a finite p.

This quantity is used in the definition of polarization density.
