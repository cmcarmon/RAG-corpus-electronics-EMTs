As a physics educator, Leigh Page was an advocate of the relativistic electromagnetism approach to the field equations. It is common for lecturers to present the Lorentz covariance of these equations, but Page said
As the dependence of electromagnetism on the relativity principle is far more intimate than is suggested by this covariance, it has seemed more logical to derive the electrodynamic equations directly from this principle.
He derived a complete electromagnetic theory, including Maxwell's equations, from only Coulomb's law and the Lorentz transformation.
Page proposed an emission theory that successfully explained blackbody radiation and other phenomena in electrodynamic terms, but was eventually abandoned in favor of later theories of quantum mechanics.
He reported on the photoelectric effect in 1913.
The theory of relativity generally concerns inertial frames of reference while students of dynamics must consider accelerations due to force. A frame of reference under constant acceleration is sometimes described as in hyperbolic motion. In 1936 Page and Adams presented in Physical Review their analysis of constantly accelerating frames as a "new relativity".
