The vertical counter-maneuver is especially effective for an attacker who possesses an advantage in thrust-to-weight ratio (sometimes called "power-loading") or energy over the bandit, but who conversely may have a worse instantaneous and/or sustained turn rate than the bandit. Such an attacker who recognizes that he is about to overshoot a bandit could, upon seeing the bandit's initial turn, pull up into a vertical zoom or power climb or a high yo-yo (a climbing turn in the same direction as the defender's horizontal turn). Even if the attacker has overshot the bandit this vertical maneuver will help to preserve the attacker's total energy and allow the attacker at or near the top of the climb to nose down and re-establish contact with the bandit's rear quarter. The bandit at this time having probably pulled a hard turn will have lost energy as a consequence of the "high-G" turn. This vertical maneuver also has allowed the attacker to put distance between itself and the bandit that might serve to foil a shot due to being out of range. The attacker is now in the position to dive in for another attack, or to disengage, therefore maintaining its offensive stance. The bandit, on the other hand, has depleted its energy in its initial turn, is below the attacker, and is possibly in a worse position than when the fight originally started. Note however that the aim of the attacker possessing an aircraft with superior power or energy, or inferior turning capabilities, is to avoid the scissors maneuver.
