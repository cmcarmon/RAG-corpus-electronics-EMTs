If one wants accuracy in temperature measurement, it can be attained by choosing a transducer that provides
a large variation in output signal over a small range of temperature. The resolution that this provides may be
translated to true accuracy by careful transducer calibration. Typical analog telemetry links maintain a measure-
ment accuracy on a single channel to 1%. This is not a limitation of the total system, since 1% of a 100-degree
temperature change would only be 1 degree, so several telemetry channels can easily share the total temperature
range to be measured, say, a 100 range divided into four 25 ranges to produce an accuracy of 1‚ÅÑ4 degree.
