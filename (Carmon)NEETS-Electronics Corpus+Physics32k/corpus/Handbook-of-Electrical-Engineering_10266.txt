CNS/ATM
The last decade of this century has seen much attention focused on Communication/Navigation/Surveillance
for  Air  Trafﬁc  Management  (CNS/ATM),  a  satellite-based  concept  developed  by  the  Future  Air  Navigation
System (FANS) Committees of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a special agency of the
United  Nations.  Many  studies  have  predicted  enormous  economic  rewards  of  CNS/ATM  for  both  aircraft
operators and air trafﬁc services providers.
