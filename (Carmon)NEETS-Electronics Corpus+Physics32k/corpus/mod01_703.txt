Sometimes victims of electrical shock suffer cardiac arrest (heart stoppage) as well as loss of
breathing. Artificial ventilation alone is not enough in cases where the heart has stopped. A technique
known as Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) has been developed to provide aid to a person who has
stopped breathing and suffered a cardiac arrest. Because you most likely will be working in the field of
electricity, the risk of electrical shock is higher than most other Navy occupations. You should, at your
earliest opportunity, learn the technique of CPR.
