TYPES OF CAPACITORSâ€”Capacitors are manufactured in various forms and may be divided into
two main classes-fixed capacitors and variable capacitors. A fixed capacitor is constructed to have a constant
or fixed value of capacitance. A variable capacitor allows the capacitance to be varied or adjusted.
