In figure 1-27, two rods replace the plates of the capacitor, and the battery is replaced by an ac
source generating a 60-hertz signal. On the positive alternation of the 60-hertz generator, the electric field
extends from the positively charged rod to the negatively charged rod, as shown. On the negative
alternation, the charge is reversed. The previous explanation of electrons moving from one plate to the
other of the capacitor in figure 1-25 can also be applied to the rods in figure 1-27.
