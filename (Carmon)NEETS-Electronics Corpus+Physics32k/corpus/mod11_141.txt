electron gun end of the tube toward the collector is not used in the bwo. Instead, the bwo extracts energy 
from the electron. beam by using a backward wave that travels from the collector toward the electron gun 
(cathode). Otherwise, the electron bunching action and energy extraction from the electron beam is very 
similar to the actions in a twt.
