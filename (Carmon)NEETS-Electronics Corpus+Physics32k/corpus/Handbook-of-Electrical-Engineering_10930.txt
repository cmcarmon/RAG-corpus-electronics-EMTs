Today, biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering heavily based both in engineering
and in the life sciences. It ranges from theoretical, nonexperimental undertakings to state-of-the-art applica-
tions.  It  can  encompass  research,  development,  implementation,  and  operation.  Accordingly,  like  medical
practice itself, it is unlikely that any single person can acquire expertise that encompasses the entire Ô¨Åeld. As a
result,  there  are  now  a  great  number  of  biomedical  engineering  specialists  to  cover  this  broad  spectrum  of
activity. Yet because of the interdisciplinary nature of this activity, there is considerable interplay and overlapping
