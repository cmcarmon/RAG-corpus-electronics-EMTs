If a mechanical system has no losses, then the input power must equal the output power. This provides a simple formula for the mechanical advantage of the system.
Let the input power to a device be a force FA acting on a point that moves with velocity vA and the output power be a force FB acts on a point that moves with velocity vB. If there are no losses in the system, then




P
=

F

v

=

v

,



{\displaystyle P=F_{B}v_{B}=F_{A}v_{A},\!}

and the mechanical advantage of the system (output force per input force) is given by





M

.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {MA} ={\frac {F_{B}}{F_{A}}}={\frac {v_{A}}{v_{B}}}.}

The similar relationship is obtained for rotating systems, where TA and ωA are the torque and angular velocity of the input and TB and ωB are the torque and angular velocity of the output. If there are no losses in the system, then




P
=

T

ω

{\displaystyle P=T_{A}\omega _{A}=T_{B}\omega _{B},\!}

which yields the mechanical advantage

{\displaystyle \mathrm {MA} ={\frac {T_{B}}{T_{A}}}={\frac {\omega _{A}}{\omega _{B}}}.}

These relations are important because they define the maximum performance of a device in terms of velocity ratios determined by its physical dimensions. See for example gear ratios.
