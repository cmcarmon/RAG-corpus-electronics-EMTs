alarms and the accommodation of the anticipated failure
modes. Simulation results indicate that unnecessary control
effort and computational complexity have been signiÔ¨Åcantly
reduced in online situations when the failures are anticipated.
Under the multiple model-based failure diagnosis process
together with the postfailure control actions, a successful
fault isolation mission is quickly reached through the multiple
model failure recognition. System performance recovery can
be obtained through the multiple model switching in the
postfailure control actions.
