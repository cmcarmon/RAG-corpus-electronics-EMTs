Ominidirectional antennas radiate only a small amount of energy toward the earth. Many techniques 
have been tried to achieve an earth-oriented antenna system. One system developed uses spin stabilization 
for orientation of the satellite. It uses a stationary inner platform for mounting remote controlled antennas. 
The satellite is constructed in two parts with both parts having radial jets. The inner platform contains the 
communications antennas and the communications package. After the satellite is stabilized in space, inner 
radial jets spin the inner platform. The inner platform is stationary with respect to earth and is oriented to 
such a position that the communications antennas point continuously toward the earth. This arrangement 
allows the use of high-gain directional antennas that concentrate the majority of the radiated energy in the 
direction of the earth.
