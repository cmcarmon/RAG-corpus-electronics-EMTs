Coverage of 100% of Transmission Line
The step-distance scheme utilizes the zone 1 and zone 2 combination to protect 100% of the transmission line.
The middle portion of the transmission line, which lies in zone 1 of relays at the two ends of the line, is protected
at high speed from both ends. However, for faults in the remaining portion of the line, the near end clears the
fault  at  high  speed,  i.e.,  in  zone 1  time,  while  the  remote  end  clears  the  fault  in  zone 2  time.  In  effect,  such
faults remain on the system for zone 2 time, which may be of the order 0.3 to 0.5 s. This becomes undesirable
in modern power systems where the margin of stability may be quite limited. In any case, it is good protection
practice to protect the entire line with high-speed clearing of all internal faults from both ends of the trans-
mission line. Pilot protection accomplishes this task.
