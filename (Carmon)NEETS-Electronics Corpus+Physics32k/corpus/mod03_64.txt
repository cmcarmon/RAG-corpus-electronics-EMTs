If the battery is disconnected, the north end of the compass needle will point to magnetic north, as
illustrated in figure 1-2(A) by the broken-line compass needle pointing to the right. When the battery is
connected, current flows through the circuit and the compass needle aligns itself with the magnetic field
of the conductor, as indicated by the solid compass needle. The strength of the magnetic field created
around the conductor is dependent upon the amount of current.
