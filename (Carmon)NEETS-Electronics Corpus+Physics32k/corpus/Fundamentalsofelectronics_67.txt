Discrete-time systems can act on discrete-time signals in ways similar to those found in analog signals
and systems. Because of the role of software in discrete-time systems, many more diﬀerent systems can be
envisioned and “constructed” with programs than can be with analog signals. Consequently, discrete-time
systems can be easily produced in software, with equivalent analog realizations diﬃcult, if not impossible,
to design.
