Most amplifier circuits are designed to operate with the grid NEGATIVE relative to the cathode.
The voltage that causes this is called a BIAS VOLTAGE. The symbol for the bias supply is Ecc. One
effect of bias (there are several other very important ones) is to reduce or eliminate grid current. Letâ€™s see
how it works.
