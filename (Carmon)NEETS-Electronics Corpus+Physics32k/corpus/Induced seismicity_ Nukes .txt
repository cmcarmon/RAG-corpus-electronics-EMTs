Nuke can cause seismic activity, but according to USGS, less energetic than the original nuclear blast, and generally do not produce earthquakes/aftershocks of reasonable size, in fact, they may instead release the elastic strain energy that was stored in the rock, which is recycled into the initial blast shockwave, enhancing its power output.
