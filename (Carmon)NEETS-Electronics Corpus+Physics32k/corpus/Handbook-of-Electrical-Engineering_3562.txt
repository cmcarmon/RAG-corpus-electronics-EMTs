The test task is difÔ¨Åcult because designs are growing in complexity; more components provide more oppor-
tunity for manufacturing defects. Test is also challenged by new microelectronic fabrication processes. These
new processes support higher levels of integration that provide fewer access points to probe internal electrical
nodes and new failure modes that provide more opportunity for manufacturing defects.
