A permanent fault is a fault whose presence is not related to
internal or external time conditions and is usually caused by
irreversible component damage. Transient faults are present for
a limited amount of time and are usually triggered by environ-
mental conditions, such as power-line ï¬‚uctuation, electromag-
netic interferences, or other radiation. These faults rarely do any
lasting damage to the component affected although they can
induce an erroneous state in the system. Finally, intermittent
faults appear, disappear, and reappear repeatedly and are caused
by unstable hardware or varying hardware state.
