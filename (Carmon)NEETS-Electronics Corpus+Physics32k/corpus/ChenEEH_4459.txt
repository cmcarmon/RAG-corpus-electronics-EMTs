A second form of covariance analysis is the iteration of the
same equations for suboptimal gain sequences. Suboptimal
gain sequences are often of interest to avoid the need for
online computation of the error covariance equations, which
are typically the most computationally expensive portion of
the Kalman algorithm. Examples of suboptimal gain sequences
