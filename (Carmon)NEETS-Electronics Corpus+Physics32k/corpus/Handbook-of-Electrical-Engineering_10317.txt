Earth Stations
Earth stations are the interface point for communications to and from the satellite [Ha, 1986]. An earth station
can be divided into two subsystems, the transmit chain and the receive chain. A common element between the
transmit and receive chain is the antenna. Because of the large signal attenuation at RF frequencies, the earth
station antenna must have high signal gain and be highly directional to focus the power to and from the satellite.
A parabolic-shaped reï¬‚ector antenna is used by earth stations since it can provide these characteristics.
