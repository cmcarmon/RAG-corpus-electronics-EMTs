The ﬁrst group contains schemes that protect a speciﬁc area of the system, i.e., a transformer, transmission
line, generator, or busbar. The most obvious example of unit protection schemes is based on Kirchhoff 's current
law—the sum of the currents entering an area of the system must be zero. Any deviation from this must indicate
an abnormal current path. In these schemes, the effects of any disturbance or operating condition outside the
area of interest are totally ignored and the protection must be designed to be stable above the maximum possible
fault current that could ﬂow through the protected area. Schemes can be made to extend across all sides of a
transformer to account for the different currents at different voltage levels. Any analysis of these schemes are
thus of more concern to the protection equipment manufacturers.
