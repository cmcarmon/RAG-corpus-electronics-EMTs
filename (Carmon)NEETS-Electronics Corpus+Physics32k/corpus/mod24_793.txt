A tree topology consists of a transmission line that branches, or splits (see figure 8-5). A tree
topology may have many different branching points. At each branching point either a passive fiber optic
splitter or an active branching device is used. In many cases both passive couplers and active branching
devices are used within a particular system. Regardless of the branching method, each connection within
the tree is a simple point-to-point link through splitters or multiple point-to-point links through active
branching devices.
