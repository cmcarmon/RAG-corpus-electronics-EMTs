Modern cars use lots of operators to trigger different actions of the systems, therefore changing the output. One of the most innovative systems involved in a car industry nowadays is Tesla AutoPilot. The car has been built with many different detectors to activate certain activities for a car to do. They have built a system where User (car driver) has to do input certain activities (e.g. engage turn signal) in order for the system to provide specific output. When a turn signal is activated the system thinks that user wants to change lane, therefore using different detectors it would measure the possibility to change lane by measuring distance to other cars around user's car and if it is possible the car would change lane itself without user doing anything else.
If the sensor tells the system the distance to the end of the lane on the sides is extremely small the car would activate side collision warning for a user to change the distance, if user does not input any activity to the system (e.g. turning the steering wheel) the car would change the lane itself.
