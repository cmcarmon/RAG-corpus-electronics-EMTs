The resultant air-gap ﬂux is produced by the combined mmfs of the stator and rotor currents.
For the sake of conceptual and analytical convenience, the total ﬂux is divided into a mutual ﬂux
(linking both the stator and the rotor) and leakage ﬂuxes, represented by appropriate reactances.
Considering the conditions in the stator, the synchronously rotating air-gap wave generates
balanced polyphase counter emfs in the phases of the stator. The volt–ampere equation for the
phase under consideration in phasor notation is given by
