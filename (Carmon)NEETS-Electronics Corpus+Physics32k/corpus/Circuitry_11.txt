This chapter has been designed to provide you with 
the  background  knowledge  required  to  help  you 
understand  the  concepts  introduced  in  the  later 
chapters.  If  you  have  studied  electrical  science, 
electrical  principles,  or  electronics  beyond  school 
level  then  you  will  already  be  familiar  with  many 
of  these  concepts.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  you  are 
returning to study or are a newcomer to electronics 
or  electrical  technology  this  chapter  will  help  you  
get up to speed. 
 
Fundamental units 
 
You  will already know that the units that  we now 
use to describe such things as length, mass and time 
are standardized within the International System of 
Units.  This  SI  system  is  based  upon  the  seven 
fundamental units (see Table 1.1). 
 
Derived units 
 
All  other  units  are  derived  from  these  seven 
fundamental  units.  These  derived  units  generally 
have 
those  commonly 
encountered in electrical circuits are summarized in 
Table 1.2 together with the corresponding physical 
quantities.
