and then extract visual features from segmented objects. Un-
constrained segmentation of an object from the background,
however, is often not possible because there generally is no
particular object in the image. Therefore, segmentation in such
a case is of very limited use as a stage preceding feature
extraction. The images thus need to be described as a whole
unit, and one should devise feature extraction schemes that do
not require segmentation. This restriction excludes a vast
number of well-known feature extraction techniques from
low-level
feature-based representation: all boundary-based
methods and many area-based methods. Basic pixel-value-
based statistics, possibly combined with edge detection tech-
niques, that reﬂect the properties of human visual system in
discriminating between image patches can be used. Invariance
to speciﬁc transforms is an issue of interest in feature extrac-
tion as well. Feature extraction methods that are global in their
nature or perform averaging over the whole image area are
often inherently translation invariant. Other types of invari-
ances (e.g., invariance to scaling, rotation, and occlusion) can
be obtained with some feature extraction schemes by using
proper transformations. Because of the perception subjectivity,
there does not exist a single best representation for a given
feature. For any given feature, there exist multiple representa-
tions that characterize the feature from different perspectives.
