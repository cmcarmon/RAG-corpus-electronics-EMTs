A full-wave voltage doubler overcomes some of the 
disadvantages of the half-wave voltage doubler. Fig-
ureÂ 36-33 is a schematic of a circuit that operates as a 
full-wave voltage doubler. Figure 36-34 shows that, on 
the positive alternation of the input signal, capacitor 
C1 charges through diode D1 to the peak value of the 
AC input signal. Figure 36-35 shows that on the nega-
tive alternation, capacitor C2 charges through diode 
D2 to the peak value of the input signal.
