Like the total and elastic stresses, the viscous stress around a certain point in the material, at any time, can be modeled by a stress tensor, a linear relationship between the normal direction vector of an ideal plane through the point and the local stress density on that plane at that point.
In any chosen coordinate system with axes numbered 1, 2, 3, this viscous stress tensor can be represented as a 3 × 3 matrix of real numbers:

{\displaystyle \varepsilon (p,t)={\begin{bmatrix}\varepsilon _{11}&\varepsilon _{12}&\varepsilon _{13}\\\varepsilon _{21}&\varepsilon _{22}&\varepsilon _{23}\\\varepsilon _{31}&\varepsilon _{32}&\varepsilon _{33}\end{bmatrix}}\,.}

Note that these numbers usually change with the point p and time t.
Consider an infinitesimal flat surface element centered on the point p, represented by a vector dA whose length is the area of the element and whose direction is perpendicular to it. Let dF be the infinitesimal force due to viscous stress that is applied across that surface element to the material on the side opposite to dA. The components of dF along each coordinate axis are then given by

In any material, the total stress tensor σ is the sum of this viscous stress tensor ε, the elastic stress tensor τ and the hydrostatic pressure p. In a perfectly fluid material, that by definition cannot have static shear stress, the elastic stress tensor is zero:

where δij is the unit tensor, such that δij is 1 if i = j and 0 if i ≠ j.
While the viscous stresses are generated by physical phenomena that depend strongly on the nature of the medium, the viscous stress tensor ε is only a description the local momentary forces between adjacent parcels of the material, and not a property of the material.
