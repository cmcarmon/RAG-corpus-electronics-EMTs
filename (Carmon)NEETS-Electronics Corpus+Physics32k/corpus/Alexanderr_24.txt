Although current and voltage are the two basic variables in an electric
circuit,  they  are  not  sufÔ¨Åcient  by  themselves.  For  practical  purposes,
we need to know how much power an electric device can handle. We
all know from experience that a 100-watt bulb gives more light than a
60-watt bulb. We also know that when we pay our bills to the electric
utility companies, we are paying for the electric energy consumed over
a  certain  period  of  time.  Thus,  power  and  energy  calculations  are
important in circuit analysis.
