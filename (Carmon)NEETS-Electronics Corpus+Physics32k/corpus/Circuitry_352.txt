Example 7.3 
 
An amplifier with negative feedback applied has an 
open-loop  voltage  gain  of  50  and  one-tenth  of  its 
output  is  fed  back  to  the  input  (i.e.  J = 0.1). 
Determine  the  overall  voltage  gain  with  negative 
feedback applied. 
 
Solution 
 
With negative feedback applied the overall voltage 
gain will be given by:
