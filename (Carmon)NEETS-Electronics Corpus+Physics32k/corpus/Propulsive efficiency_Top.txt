In aircraft and rocket design, overall propulsive efficiency



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the efficiency with which the energy contained in a vehicle's propellant is converted into kinetic energy of the vehicle, to accelerate it, or to replace losses due to aerodynamic g or gravity. It can also be described as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than one, because conservation of momentum requires that the exhaust have some of the kinetic energy, and the propulsive mechanism (whether propeller, jet exhaust, or ducted fan) is never perfectly efficient. Overall propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on air density and airspeed.
Mathematically, it is represented as



η
=

η

c



η

p




{\displaystyle \eta =\eta _{c}\eta _{p}}
, where




η

c




{\displaystyle \eta _{c}}
is the cycle efficiency and




η

p




{\displaystyle \eta _{p}}
is the mechanical efficiency.
