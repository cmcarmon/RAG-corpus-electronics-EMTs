In the UK an 80-year-old pensioner John Catt and his daughter Linda were stopped by City of London Police while driving in London, UK in 2005. They had their vehicle searched under section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and were threatened with arrest if they refused to answer questions. After they complained formally, it was discovered they were stopped when their car was picked up by roadside ANPR CCTV cameras; it had been flagged in the Police National Computer database when they were seen near EDO MBM demonstrations in Brighton. Critics point out that the Catts had been suspected of no crime, however the police ANPR system led to them being targeted due to their association.
