still easily comprehensive example on how to construct a
simulation model in three physical domains featuring both
time-continuous and event-discrete behavior. In addition,
synthesizable models of digital signal processing units are
incorporated at register and algorithmic levels as deÔ¨Åned in
Table 3.1.
