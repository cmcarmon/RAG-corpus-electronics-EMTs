The lower limit of the subthreshold current is determined by
the leakage current that ï¬‚ows from source to drain when the
transistor is off. This current, which is referred to as the off-
state leakage, is determined by the source-to-channel poten-
tial barrier as well as the leakage currents of the source and
drain junctions. For this reason, it is critical to be able to form
low leakage junctions.
