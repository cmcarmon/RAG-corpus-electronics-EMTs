Figure 73.3 shows a realization of a noise process N(t), where at any particular time t, the probability density
function is shown coming out of the page in a third dimension. For a ws noise, the distributions are the same
for  each  t.  The  most  mathematically  tractable  noises  are  Gaussian  ws  processes,  where  at  each  time  t  the
probability  distribution  for  the  random  variable  Nt  =  N(t)  is  Gaussian  (also  called  normal).  The  Ô¨Årst-  and
second-order  statistics  completely  determine  Gaussian  distributions,  and  so  ws  makes  their  statistics  of  all
orders stationary over time also. It is well known [see Brown, 1983, p. 39] that linear transformations of Gaussian
random variables are also Gaussian random variables. The probability density function for a Gaussian random
variable Nt is fN (x) = {1/[2ps
2 ],  which is the familiar bell-shaped curve centered on
