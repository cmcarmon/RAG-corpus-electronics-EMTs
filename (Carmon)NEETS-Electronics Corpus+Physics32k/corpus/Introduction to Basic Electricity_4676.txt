Modern computers utilize a means of incorporat-
ing several instructional commands into a single in-
put instruction. This is accomplished by a program 
stored in memory. When the control unit decodes the 
instruction, it causes a sequence of instructions to be 
executed. The control unit varies from computer to 
computer. Basically, the control unit consists of an ad-
dress register, an instruction register, an instruction 
decoder, a program counter, a clock, and circuitry for 
generating the control pulses (Figure 46-2).
