Interfacing
In circuit design applications, the LED may be treated much as a regular diode, but with a much greater forward
voltage, VF. Since one usually seeks maximum brightness from the device, it is usually conducting heavily and
VF approaches the contact potential. As one moves from GaAs to GaP [Fig. 83.3(a)], VF varies from about 1.5
to around 2.0 V. The variation in VF with temperature (at constant current) follows similar rules as apply to
conventional diodes, but radiant power and wavelengths also change [Gage et al., 1981].
