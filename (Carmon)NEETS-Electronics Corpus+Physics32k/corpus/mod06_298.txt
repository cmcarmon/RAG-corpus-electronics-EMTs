One of the probems associated with electron tubes is that they are bulky. The size of an electron tube
circuit can be decreased by enclosing more than one tube within a single envelope, as mentioned in
chapter 1. There is a large variety of tubes that can be combined into this grouping of "specialty tubes"
called MULTI-UNIT tubes. Figure 2-1 illustrates the schematic symbols of a few of the possible
combinations found in multi-unit tubes.
