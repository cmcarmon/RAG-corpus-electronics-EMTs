With your multimeter set on ohms, measure the resistance of the pot 
from the wiper lead to the fixed lead that is not connected to the wiper. 
Then, dial the pot all the way in one direction or the other until your 
multimeter reads 0 Î©. This value is the pot resistance you will start with 
in your circuit.
