The design of RSVP lends itself to be used with a variety of
QoS control services. RSVP speciﬁcation does not deﬁne the
internal format of the RSVP protocol ﬁelds or objects and
treats them as opaque; it deals only with the setup mechanism.
RSVP was designed to support both unicast and multicast
applications. RSVP supports heterogeneous QoS, which
means different receivers in the same multicast group can
request different QoS. This heterogeneity allows some receivers
to have reservations, whereas others could receive the same
trafﬁc using the best-effort service. We now discuss the service
classes offered by IntServ.
