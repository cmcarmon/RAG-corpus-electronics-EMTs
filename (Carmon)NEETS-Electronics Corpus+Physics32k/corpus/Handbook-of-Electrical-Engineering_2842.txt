Step  2  in  the  SMT  process  is  to  deﬁne  all  the  footprints  of  the  SMDs  under  consideration  for  use  in  the
design. The footprint is the copper pattern or “land”, on the circuit board upon which the SMD will be placed.
Footprint examples are shown in Figs. 26.5a and 26.5b, and footprint recommendations are available from IC
manufacturers and in the appropriate data books. They are also available in various ECAD packages used for
the design process, or in several references that include an overview of the SMT process [Electronic Packaging
and  Production,  1994].  However,  the  reader  is  seriously  cautioned  about  using  the  general  references  for
anything other than the most common passive and active packages. Even the position of pin 1 may be different
among  IC  manufacturers  of  the “same”  chip.  The  footprint  deﬁnition  may  also  include  the  position  of  the
solder resist pattern surrounding the copper pattern. Footprint deﬁnition sizing will vary depending on whether
reﬂow or wave solder process is used. Wave solder footprints will require recognition of the direction of travel
of  the  board  through  the  wave,  to  minimize  solder  shadowing  in  the  ﬁnal  ﬁllet,  as  well  as  requirements  for
solder thieves. The copper footprint must allow for the formation of an appropriate, inspectable solder ﬁllet.
If done as part of the EDA process (electronic design automation, using appropriate electronic CAD software),
the software will automatically assign copper directions to each component footprint, as well as appropriate
coordinates and dimensions. These may need adjustment based on considerations related to wave soldering,
test points, RF and/or power issues, and board production limitations. Allowing the software to select 5 mil
traces when the board production facility to be used can only reliably do 10 mil traces would be inappropriate.
Likewise, the solder resist patterns must be governed by the production capabilities.
