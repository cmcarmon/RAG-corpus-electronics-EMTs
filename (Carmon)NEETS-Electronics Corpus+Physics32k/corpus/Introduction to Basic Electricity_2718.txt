frequencies, the reactance of the coil is low. There-
fore, it opposes little current, and most of the voltage 
is dropped across the resistor. As the input frequency 
increases, the inductive reactance increases and offers 
more opposition to current flow so that more voltage 
drops across the inductor. With more voltage dropped 
across the inductor, less voltage is dropped across the 
resistor. Increasing the input frequency decreases the 
output voltage. Low frequencies are passed with little 
reduction in amplitude, whereas high frequencies are 
greatly reduced in amplitude.
