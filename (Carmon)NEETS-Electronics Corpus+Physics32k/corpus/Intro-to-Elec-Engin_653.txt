Breakpoint Analysis
When a circuit consists of two or more ideal diodes, it will have several distinct operating
conditions resulting from the off and on states of the diodes. A systematic way of ﬁnding those
operating conditions is the method of breakpoint analysis. For a two-terminal network containing
resistors, sources, and N ideal diodes, and driven by a source voltage v, the i–v characteristic
will in general consist of N + 1 straight-line segments with N breakpoints. The i–v curve can be
constructed by following these steps:
1. For v → ∞, determine the states of all diodes, and write i in terms of v; do the same for
