In the joint supply voltageâ€“threshold voltage reduction, the
supply voltage can be reduced to decrease the power consump-
tion and at the same time decrease the threshold voltage to
compensate for the speed loss. The decrease in the threshold
voltage, however, will cause more static power dissipation due
to the increase in the leakage current. One alternative is to use
multithreshold devices where different devices with different
threshold voltages are used across the design to limit the
amount of leakage current. Another alternative is the use of
variable threshold devices where the threshold voltage is dy-
namically controlled through substrate biasing.
