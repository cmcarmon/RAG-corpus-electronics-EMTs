A good point to remember is that the higher the frequency, or the larger the interelectrode 
capacitance, the higher will be the current through this capacitance. The circuit in figure 2-1C, shows the 
interelectrode capacitance between the grid and the cathode (Cgk) in parallel with the signal source. As 
the frequency of the input signal increases, the effective grid-to-cathode impedance of the tube decreases 
because of a decrease in the reactance of the interelectrode capacitance. If the signal frequency is 100 
megahertz or greater, the reactance of the grid-to-cathode capacitance is so small that much of the signal 
is short-circuited within the tube. Since the interelectrode capacitances are effectively in parallel with the 
tuned circuits, as shown in figures 2-1A, B, and C, they will also affect the frequency at which the tuned 
circuits resonate.
