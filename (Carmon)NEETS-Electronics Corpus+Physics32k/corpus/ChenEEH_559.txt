Example 7.2. The diode designed in example 7.1 has a
high-level carrier lifetime of 500 ns. At a current density
of 100 A=cm2, assuming conduction in high-level injec-
p
tion, the voltage drop across the diode is roughly given
by equation 7.2, where La Â¼ (
Data). The ambipolar
diffusion constant, Da, for a diode at room temperature
is 9 cm2=V-s. Then, for a lifetime of 500 ns, the ambipo-
lar diffusion length, La, is 21 mm, and the forward volt-
age of the diode is 0.82 V.
