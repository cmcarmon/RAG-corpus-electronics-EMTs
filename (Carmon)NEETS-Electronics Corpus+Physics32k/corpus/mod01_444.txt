The technicianâ€™s main aid in troubleshooting a circuit in a piece of equipment is the SCHEMATIC
DIAGRAM. The schematic diagram is a "picture" of the circuit that uses symbols to represent the various
circuit components; physically large or complex circuits can be shown on a relatively small diagram.
Before studying the basic schematic, look at figure 3-1. This figure shows the symbols that are used in
this chapter. These, and others like them, are referred to and used throughout the study of electricity and
electronics.
