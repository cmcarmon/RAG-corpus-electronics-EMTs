As shown in Figure A.3, let us assume that the terminals labeled x and
y are attached to the end surfaces of the filament, and that the end faces are
equipotential surfaces. Let us determine the set of conditions under which (1) a
unique voltage V can be defined across x and y and (2) a unique current I can
be defined through x and y.
