While there are many advantages to distributed systems, there are also several disadvantages. The primary
difﬁculty is that software for implementing distributed systems is large and complex. Small personal computers
could  not  effectively  run  modern  distributed  applications.  Software  development  tools  for  this  environment
are not well advanced. Thus, application developers are having a difﬁcult time working in this environment.
An additional problem is network speed. Most ofﬁce networks are currently based on IEEE standard 802.3
[IEEE, 1985], commonly (although erroneously) called Ethernet, which operates at 10 Mb/s (ten million bits
per second). With this limited bandwidth, it is easy to saturate the network. While higher-speed networks such
 networks do exist, they are not yet in common use. While distributed computing has many

advantages, we must also understand that without appropriate safeguards, our data may not be secure.
