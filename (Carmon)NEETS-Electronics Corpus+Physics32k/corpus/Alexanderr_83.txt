which  shows  that  the  total  current  i is  shared  by  the  resistors  in
inverse  proportion  to  their  resistances. This  is  known  as  the  princi-
ple  of  current  division,  and  the  circuit  in  Fig.  2.31  is  known  as  a
current  divider.  Notice  that  the  larger  current  flows  through  the
smaller  resistance.
