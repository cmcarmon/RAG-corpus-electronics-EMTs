Field Strength
The  ﬁeld  strength  produced  by  a  standard  broadcast  station  is  a  key  factor  in  determining  the  primary  and
secondary service areas and interference limitations of possible future radio stations. The ﬁeld strength limitations
are  speciﬁed  as  ﬁeld  intensities  by  the  FCC  with  the  units  volts  per  meter;  however,  measuring  devices  may
read volts or decibels referenced to 1 mW (dBm), and a conversion may be needed to obtain the ﬁeld intensity.
The power received may be measured in dBm and converted to watts. Voltage readings may be converted to
watts by squaring the root mean square (rms) voltage and dividing by the ﬁeld strength meter input resistance,
which is typically on the order of 50 or 75 W. Additional factors needed to determine electric ﬁeld intensity
are the power gain and losses of the ﬁeld strength receiving antenna system. Once the power gain and losses
are known, the effective area with loss compensation of the ﬁeld strength receiver antenna may be obtained as
