In AC circuits, current is constantly 
reversing direction. So how do you show current flow in a circuit diagram? 
Which way should the arrow point? The answer is that it doesnâ€™t matter. You 
arbitrarily choose a direction for the current flow (known as the reference 
direction), and you label that current I. The value of I fluctuates up and down 
as the current alternates. If the value of I is negative, that just means that the 
(conventional) current is flowing in the direction opposite to the way the 
arrow is pointing.
