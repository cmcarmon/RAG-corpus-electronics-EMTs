Fuzzy logic is also widely used to deal with uncertainty.
Probability theory represents uncertainty based on frequency
of occurrence, whereas fuzzy logic sets represent imprecision as
a graded membership function with a value between zero and
one. Fuzzy logic has been applied in various types of expert
systems, including rule-based systems, to handle uncertainties.
In fuzzy rule-based expert systems, knowledge is represented in
fuzzy rules and fuzzy sets. Fuzzy rules are if-then statements
that contain fuzzy variables. These rules are processed based on
the mathematical principles of fuzzy logic.
