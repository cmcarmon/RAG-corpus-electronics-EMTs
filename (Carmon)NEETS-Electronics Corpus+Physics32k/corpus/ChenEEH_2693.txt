2. Number of time steps, nmax: A self-consistent solution
in the time domain mandates that the numerical wave
analogs propagate over time scales sufﬁcient to causally
connect each portion of
interest.
Therefore, nmax must increase as the maximum elec-
trical size of the structure. In three dimensions, it can
be argued that nmax is a fractional power function of N
such as N 1=3. Further, nmax must be adequate to step
through ‘‘ring-up’’ and ‘‘ring-down’’ times of energy
storage features such as cavities. These features vary
from problem to problem and cannot be ascribed a
dependence relative to N.
