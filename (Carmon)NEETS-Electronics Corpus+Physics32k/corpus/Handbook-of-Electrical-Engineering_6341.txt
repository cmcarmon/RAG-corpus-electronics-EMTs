In addition to providing signiﬁcantly enhanced audio quality, DAB systems are being developed to overcome
the technical deﬁciencies of existing AM and FM analog broadcast systems. The foremost problem of current
broadcast  technology,  as  perceived  by  the  industry,  is  its  susceptibility  to  interference.  AM  medium-wave
broadcasts, operating in the 530- to 1700-kHz frequency range, are prone to disruption by ﬂuorescent lighting
and by power system distribution networks, as well as by numerous other manufactured unintentional radiators,
including computer and telephone systems. Additionally, natural effects, such as nighttime skywave propagation
interference between stations and lightning, cause irritating service disruption to AM reception. FM broadcast
transmissions in the 88- to 108-MHz band are much more resistant to these types of interference. However,
multipath propagation and abrupt signal fading, especially found in urban and mountainous areas containing
a  large  number  of  signal  reﬂectors  and  shadowers  (e.g.,  buildings  and  terrain),  can  seriously  degrade  FM
reception, particularly in automobiles.
