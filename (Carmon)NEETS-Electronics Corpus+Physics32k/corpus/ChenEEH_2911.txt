Amplitude ﬂuctuation, angle ﬂuctuation, receiver thermal
noise, and servo-noise limit the tracking accuracy. Amplitude
ﬂuctuation of an echo signal is an important limitation factor
to the lobe switching and conical scan radars but not an
important factor to the monopulse radar. In a tracking radar,
the apparent angle of arrival (AOA) of a target is at the direc-
tion of the antenna with zero error signal. The apparent AOA
may not be conﬁned to the physical extent of the target and
may be off the target. Changes in the target aspect with respect
to the radar may cause the apparent AOA to wander from one
direction to another direction. This random wandering of the
apparent AOA is called angle ﬂuctuation or target glint. The
glint phenomenon is more pronounced when a relatively large
target is at short range, which may make the radar unable to
track the target and may be the chief factor limiting tracking
accuracy. The angular error due to glint varies inversely with
distance. Different carrier frequencies may produce different
glint errors. The glint error can be reduced by averaging the
independent measurements obtained with frequency agility
over a bandwidth greater than c/2D, where D is the target
depth. The qualitative angular error as a function of range is
shown in Figure 10.6. The thermal noise term is inversely
proportional to R2, the glint error is inversely proportional
to R, and the servo-noise is independent of range.
