• Thyristor-switched shunt capacitors (TSC): The idea is to split a capacitor bank into sufﬁciently small
capacitor steps and switch those steps on and off individually. Figure 61.26(a) shows the concept of the
TSC. It offers stepwise control, virtually no transients, and no harmonic generation. The average delay
for executing a command from the regulator is half a cycle.
