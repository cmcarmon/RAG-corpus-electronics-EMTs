This three-dimensional projection was generated using the MAPLE® software package.
MAPLE® is one of three important mathematical computer packages that offer a variety
of analytical and numerical software for use by scientists, engineers, and mathematicians.
This ﬁgure was developed by W.K. Schief and C. Rogers and the Center for Dynamical
Systems  and  Nonlinear  Studies  at  Georgia  Institute  of  Technology  and  the  University  of
New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. (Figure courtesy of Schief and Rogers.)
