EM wave propagation can be described by two complementary models. The physicist attempts a theoretical
model based on universal laws, which extends the ﬁeld of application more widely than currently known. The
engineer  prefers  an  empirical  model  based  on  measurements,  which  can  be  used  immediately.  This  section
presents  complementary  standpoints  by  discussing  theoretical  factors  affecting  wave  propagation  and  the
semiempirical rules allowing handy engineering calculations. First, we consider wave propagation in idealistic
simple  media,  with  no  obstacles.  We  later  consider  the  more  realistic  case  of  wave  propagation  around  the
earth, as inﬂuenced by its curvature and by atmospheric conditions.
