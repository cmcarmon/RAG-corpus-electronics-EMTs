Materials are acted on by forces (stresses) and the resulting deformations are called strains. An example of a
strain due to a force to the material is the change of dimension parallel and perpendicular to the applied force.
It is useful to introduce the coordinate system and the numbering conventions which are used when discussing
z
 directions, respectively. Displacements have single
these materials. Subscripts 1, 2, and 3 refer to the 
indices associated with their direction. If the material has a preferred axis, such as the poling direction in PZT,
. To make the
the axis is designated the 
notation less cluttered and confusing, contracted notation has been deÔ¨Åned. The following mnemonic rule is
used to reduce the double index to a single index:
