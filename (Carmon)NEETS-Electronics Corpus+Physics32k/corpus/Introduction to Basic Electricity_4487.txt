Asynchronous counters are commonly referred to 
as ripple counters. The input clock pulse is first felt 
by the first flip-flop. The effect is not felt by the second 
flip-flop immediately because of the delay through the 
first flip-flop. In a multistage counter, the delay is felt 
through each flip-flop, so the effect of the input clock 
pulse “ripples” through the counter. Figure 44-12 shows 
a three-stage binary counter and timing chart for each 
of the stages. A truth table shows the counting sequence.
Synchronous means “occurring at the same time.” 
A synchronous counter is a counter in which each 
stage is clocked at the same time. This is accomplished 
by connecting the clock input to each stage of the 
counter (Figure 44-13). A synchronous counter is also 
called a parallel counter because the clock input is 
connected in parallel to each flip-flop.
