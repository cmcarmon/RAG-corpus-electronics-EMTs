Fiber Drawing
After a preform has been inspected for various defects such as bubbles, ovality, and straightness, it is taken to
a ﬁber drawing station. A large-scale ﬁber drawing process must repeatedly maintain the optical quality of the
preform and produce a dimensionally uniform ﬁber with high strength.
