Demonstrating neutral buoyancy can be simple. Find a non-absorbent and incompressible object, and two miscible fluids, one that is more dense than the object and one that is less dense. In the first fluid, the object will float. In the second, it will sink. However, when the two liquids are mixed, it will be somewhere in between, and when the density of the fluid equals the average density of the object it will have neutral buoyancy and remain at any given depth unless disturbed.
