b) Using the switch-resistor MOSFET model, design an inverter satisfying the static
discipline for the four voltage thresholds using an n-channel MOSFET with
Rn = 1 k and VT = 1.8 V. Recall, Ron = Rn(L/W). Assume VS = 5 V and R2
for a resistor is 500 . Further assume that the area of the inverter is given by
the sum of the areas of the MOSFET and the resistor. Assume that the area of a
device is L × W. The inverter should take as little area as possible with minimum
size for L or W being 0.5 µm. Graph the input-output transfer function of the
inverter. What is the total area of the inverter? What is its static power dissipation?
