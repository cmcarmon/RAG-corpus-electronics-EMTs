Coupling-Driven Signal Encoding
The key idea in coupling-driven signal encoding is that trans-
forming the signal sequences traveling on-chip busses that are
closely placed could alleviate coupling effects (Kim et al.,
2000). Small blocks of encoding and decoding logic are
employed at the transmitter and receiver of on-chip busses as
shown in Figure 7.9.
