The three required changes in velocity can be obtained directly from the vis-viva equation

,


{\displaystyle v^{2}=\mu \left({\frac {2}{r}}-{\frac {1}{a}}\right),}

where




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the speed of an orbiting body,




μ

M


{\displaystyle \mu =GM}
is the standard gravitational parameter of the primary body,




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance of the orbiting body from the primary, i.e., the radius,




a


{\displaystyle a}
is the semi-major axis of the body's orbit.
In what follows,





r

1




{\displaystyle r_{1}}
is the radius of the initial circular orbit,





r

2




{\displaystyle r_{2}}
is the radius of the final circular orbit,





r

b




{\displaystyle r_{b}}
is the common apoapsis radius of the two transfer ellipses and is a free parameter of the maneuver,





a

1




{\displaystyle a_{1}}
and




a

2




{\displaystyle a_{2}}
are the semimajor axes of the two elliptical transfer orbits, which are given by

{\displaystyle a_{1}={\frac {r_{1}+r_{b}}{2}}}
,

{\displaystyle a_{2}={\frac {r_{2}+r_{b}}{2}}}
.

Starting from the initial circular orbit with radius




r

1




{\displaystyle r_{1}}
(dark blue circle in the figure to the right), a prograde burn (mark 1 in the figure) puts the spacecraft on the first elliptical transfer orbit (aqua half-ellipse). The magnitude of the required delta-v for this burn is

{\displaystyle \Delta v_{1}={\sqrt {{\frac {2\mu }{r_{1}}}-{\frac {\mu }{a_{1}}}}}-{\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{r_{1}}}}.}

When the apoapsis of the first transfer ellipse is reached at a distance




r

b




{\displaystyle r_{b}}
from the primary, a second prograde burn (mark 2) raises the periapsis to match the radius of the target circular orbit, putting the spacecraft on a second elliptic trajectory (orange half-ellipse). The magnitude of the required delta-v for the second burn is

{\displaystyle \Delta v_{2}={\sqrt {{\frac {2\mu }{r_{2}}}-{\frac {\mu }{a_{2}}}}}-{\sqrt {{\frac {2\mu }{r_{2}}}-{\frac {\mu }{a_{1}}}}}.}

Lastly, when the final circular orbit with radius




r

2




{\displaystyle r_{2}}
is reached, a retrograde burn (mark 3) circularizes the trajectory into the final target orbit (red circle). The final retrograde burn requires a delta-v of magnitude

If




r

b


=

r

2




{\displaystyle r_{b}=r_{2}}
, then the maneuver reduces to a Hohmann transfer (in that case



Δ

v

{\displaystyle \Delta v_{3}}
can be verified to become zero). Thus the bi-elliptic transfer constitutes a more general class of orbital transfers, of which the Hohmann transfer is a special two-impulse case.

The maximal possible savings can be computed by assuming that




r

b


=
∞


{\displaystyle r_{b}=\infty }
, in which case the total

{\displaystyle \Delta v}
simplifies to

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\mu /r_{1}}}\left({\sqrt {2}}-1\right)\left(1+{\sqrt {r_{1}/r_{2}}}\right)}
. In this case, one also speaks of a bi-parabolic transfer because the two transfer trajectories are no longer ellipses but parabolas. The transfer time increases to infinity too.
