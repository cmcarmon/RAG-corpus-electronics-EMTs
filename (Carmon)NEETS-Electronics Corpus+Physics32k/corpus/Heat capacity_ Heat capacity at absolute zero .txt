{\displaystyle T\,{\text{d}}S=\delta Q,}

the absolute entropy can be calculated by integrating from zero to the final temperature Tf:

{\displaystyle S(T_{\text{f}})=\int _{T=0}^{T_{\text{f}}}{\frac {\delta Q}{T}}=\int _{0}^{T_{\text{f}}}{\frac {\delta Q}{{\text{d}}T}}{\frac {{\text{d}}T}{T}}=\int _{0}^{T_{\text{f}}}C(T)\,{\frac {{\text{d}}T}{T}}.}

The heat capacity must be zero at zero temperature in order for the above integral not to yield an infinite absolute entropy, which would violate the third law of thermodynamics. One of the strengths of the Debye model is that (unlike the preceding Einstein model) it predicts the proper mathematical form of the approach of heat capacity toward zero, as absolute zero temperature is approached.
