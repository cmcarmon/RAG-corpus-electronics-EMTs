▶✓ Power switch/battery/fuse: The on/off switch connects and disconnects 
the battery that powers the multimeter. Many multimeters use standard‐
size batteries, such as a 9‐volt or AAA cell, but pocket‐size meters use a 
coin‐type battery. Most multimeters use an internal fuse to protect them-
selves against excessive current or voltage; some come with a spare fuse 
(if yours doesn’t, buy one).
Avoid using rechargeable batteries in a multimeter; they may produce 
erroneous results for some models.
