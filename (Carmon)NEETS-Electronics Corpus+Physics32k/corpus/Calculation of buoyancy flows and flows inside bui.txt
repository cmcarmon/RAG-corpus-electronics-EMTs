Buoyancy force is the defined as the force exerted on the body or an object when inserted in a fluid. Buoyancy force is based on the basic principle of pressure variation with depth, since pressure increases with depth. Hence buoyancy force arises as pressure on the bottom surface of the immersed object is greater than that at the top.
Flow problems in buildings were studied since 700 B.C. Recent advancements in CFD and CAE have led to comprehensive calculation of buoyancy flows and flows in buildings.
