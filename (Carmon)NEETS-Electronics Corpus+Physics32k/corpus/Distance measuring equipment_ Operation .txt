Aircraft use DME to determine their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs â€“ two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or ILS systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS glide slope antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS marker beacons.
A typical Distance measuring equipment ground transponder system for en-route or terminal navigation will have a 1 kW peak pulse output on the assigned UHF channel.
