According to Stokes’ law, a perfect sphere traveling through a viscous liquid feels a drag force proportional to the frictional coefficient

s


{\displaystyle F_{drag}=fs=(6\pi \eta a)s}

where



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the liquid's viscosity,



s


{\displaystyle s}
is the sphere's drift speed, and



a


{\displaystyle a}
is its radius. Because ionic mobility



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is directly proportional to drift speed, it is inversely proportional to the frictional coefficient:




μ
=



z

f




{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {ze}{f}}}

where



z

{\displaystyle ze}
represents ionic charge in integer multiples of electron charges.
In 1905, Albert Einstein found the diffusion coefficient



D


{\displaystyle D}
of an ion to be proportional to its mobility constant:

{\displaystyle D={\frac {\mu k_{B}T}{q}}={\frac {k_{B}T}{f}}}

where




k

{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is the Boltzmann constant and



q


{\displaystyle q}
is electrical charge. This is known as the Einstein relation. Substituting in the frictional coefficient of a perfect sphere from Stokes’ law yields

{\displaystyle D={\frac {k_{B}T}{6\pi \eta a}}}

which can be rearranged to solve for

In non-spherical systems, the frictional coefficient is determined by the size and shape of the species under consideration.
