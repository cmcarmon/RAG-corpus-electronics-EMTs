Effective rehabilitation engineers must be well versed in all of the areas described above because they generally work
in a team setting, in collaboration with physical and occupational therapists, orthopedic surgeons, physical medicine
specialists, and/or neurologists. Some rehabilitation engineers are interested in certain activities that we do in the
 (ADL). These include eating, toileting,
course of a normal day that could be summarized as 
  and  the  limitations  to  mobility.
combing  hair,  brushing  teeth,  reading,  etc.  Other  engineers  focus  on 
Mobility can be personal (e.g., within a home or ofﬁce) or public (automobile, public transportation, accessibility
questions in buildings). Mobility also includes the ability to move functionally through the environment. Thus, the
question of mobility is not limited to that of getting from place to place, but also includes such questions as whether
one can reach an object in a particular setting or whether a paralyzed urinary bladder can be made functional again.
Barriers that limit mobility are also studied. For example, an ill-ﬁtted wheelchair cushion or support system will
most assuredly limit mobility by reducing the time that an individual can spend in a wheelchair before he or she
must vacate it to avoid serious and difﬁcult-to-heal pressure sores. Other groups of rehabilitation engineers deal
, both on the production side
with 
(e.g., the nonvocal) or on the comprehension side. For any given client, a rehabilitation engineer might have all of
these concerns to consider (i.e., ADLs, mobility, sensory, and communication dysfunctions).
