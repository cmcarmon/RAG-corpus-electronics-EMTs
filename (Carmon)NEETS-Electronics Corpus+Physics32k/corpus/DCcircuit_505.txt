These internal resistances, small as they may be, turn our simple parallel circuit into a
series-parallel combination circuit. Usually, the internal resistances of voltage sources are
low enough that they can be safely ignored, but when high currents resulting from shorted
components are encountered, their effects become very noticeable.
In this case, a shorted
R2 would result in almost all the voltage being dropped across the internal resistance of the
battery, with almost no voltage left over for resistors R1, R2, and R3:
