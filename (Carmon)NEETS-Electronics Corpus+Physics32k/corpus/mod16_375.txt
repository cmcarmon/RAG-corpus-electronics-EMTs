The range used to measure any particular unknown resistance (Rx in view A of figure 3-14) depends
on the approximate ohmic value of the unknown resistance. For instance, the ohmmeter scale of the figure
is calibrated in divisions from 0 to infinity. Note that the divisions are easier to read on the right-hand
portion of the scale than on the left. For this reason, if Rx is greater than 1,000 ohms and if you are using
the R ·  1 range, you will be unable to accurately read the indicated resistance. This happens because the
combined series resistance of resistors Rx is too large for range R ·  1 to allow enough battery current to
flow to deflect the pointer away from infinity. You need to turn the range switch to the R ·  10 position to
obtain the 1,000-ohm reading.
