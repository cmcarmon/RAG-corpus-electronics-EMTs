On occasion, companies will want to use seawater for this process due to its extreme low obtaining cost. The seawater used is usually brackish water or brine (i.e. a solution with >0.5% salinity). In these cases, random chemicals may be introduced into the system. These random chemicals pose no threat to the system however, due to the simplicity of the process. The low voltage DC current that is applied will do only what it is intended to do, i.e. electrochlorination. The excess random chemicals are left untouched and can be easily discarded.
