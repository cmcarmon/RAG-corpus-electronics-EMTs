REMOD can be applied to circuits containing an array of
independent cells, such as a carry-save adder, or an array of
linearly dependent cells, such as a ripple-carry adder. REMOD
has also been applied to partially dependent cells found in
a multiplier by partitioning the circuit into sub-arrays of
independent cells.
