It is difficult at first to have an intuitive grasp of the current source, princi-
pally because there is no familiar device available at the electronic parts counter
that has these properties. However, one can still find special devices that deliver
constant current to the arc lamps to illuminate the streets of Old Montreal,
and we will show later that MOSFETs and Op Amps make excellent current
sources. But these are not as familiar as the flashlight battery.
