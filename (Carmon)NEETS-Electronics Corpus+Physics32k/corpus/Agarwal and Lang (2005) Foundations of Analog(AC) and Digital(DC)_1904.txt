where φ = tan
Let us analyze the response at various frequencies. Equation 13.78 shows
that at low frequencies (ω → 0) the expression for vo is no different from
that in Equation 13.74. Thus the response to a DC signal or a very low fre-
quency sinusoid is similar to the response when the capacitor is absent. This
is not surprising because the capacitor behaves as an open circuit at very low
frequencies.
