Analyzing complex circuits
Ohm’s Law comes in handy when analyzing more complex circuits than the 
simple light bulb circuit discussed earlier. You often need to incorporate 
your knowledge of equivalent resistances to apply Ohm’s Law and figure 
out exactly where current is flowing and how voltages are being dropped 
throughout your circuit.
