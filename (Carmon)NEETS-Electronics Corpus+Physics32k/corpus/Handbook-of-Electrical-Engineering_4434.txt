The basic circuit conﬁguration for three-terminal device ampliﬁers is shown in Fig. 43.1(b). Several different
types of ampliﬁers developed using transistors are low noise, power, high linearity, broadband, high efﬁciency,
logarithmic, limiting, transimpedance, and variable gain. The silicon bipolar transistor performs very well up
to about 4 GHz, with reliable performance, high power, high gain, and low cost. The GaAs MESFETs perform
better than the bipolar transistors above 4 GHz. They are broadband, have a wide dynamic range, are highly
reliable, and are low cost. Both low-noise and medium-power MESFET ampliﬁers are available. They compete
with uncooled parametric ampliﬁers as well as moderate-power IMPATTs. HEMTs ﬁnd a niche in low-noise
 of HEMT ampliﬁers is better than that of uncooled para-
and high-frequency applications. The 
metric ampliﬁers up to 100 GHz, as shown in Fig. 43.2.
