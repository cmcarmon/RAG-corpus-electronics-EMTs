An Op Amp embedded in a more complicated RC circuit is shown in
Figure 15.23a. This is an RC active filter, with all of the useful resonance prop-
erties of a capacitor-inductor circuit. To show this, we calculate the output
voltage vo in terms of vi. First draw the linear-region circuit model with the
dependent source, Figure 15.23b. Then write Node equations, taking cur-
