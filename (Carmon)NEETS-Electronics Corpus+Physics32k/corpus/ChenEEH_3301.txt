when the power generations and loads are speciﬁed. For a
power system with N buses, there are 2N number of power
ﬂow equations. At
six variables:
PGi, QGi, PLi, QLi, Vi, and di. Depending on the nature of the
bus, four of these variables will be speciﬁed at each bus, leaving
two unknown variables at each bus. We will end up with 2N
unknown variables related by 2N equations 7.43 and 7.44, and
our aim in the rest of this section is to develop algorithms for
solving this problem.
is, with
PGi ¼ QGi ¼ 0. In this case, the loads PLi and QLi are assumed
to be known either from measurements or from load esti-
mates, and the bus voltage variables Vi and di are the unknown
variables. Purely load busses with no generation support are
called PQ busses in power ﬂow studies because both real-
power injection Pi and reactive power Qi have been speciﬁed
at these busses.
