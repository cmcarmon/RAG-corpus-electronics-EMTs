The collection of linear, time-invariant systems are the most thoroughly understood systems. Much of
the signal processing and system theory discussed here concentrates on such systems. For example, electric
circuits are, for the most part, linear and time-invariant. Nonlinear ones abound, but characterizing them
so that you can predict their behavior for any input remains an unsolved problem.
