To motivate the study of methods based on the sinusoidal steady state,
let us present an example of the type of problem that can be solved with ease
using these methods. Suppose we construct the linear small-signal amplifier
shown in Figure 13.2 by concatenating two single stage MOSFET amplifiers
of the type studied in Chapter 8. The DC voltage VI is chosen to bias the
first stage appropriately, and the DC value of the first stage output voltage VO
provides the bias for the second stage. Figure 13.2 further shows the presence
of a capacitor CGS at the input node of the second stage (for example, reflecting
the gate capacitance of the MOSFET in the second stage).
