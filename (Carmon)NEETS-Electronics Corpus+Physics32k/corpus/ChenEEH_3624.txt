The norm p is usually chosen to be inﬁnity or 2. The L1
norm is used for input signals that have some dominating
frequency component, whereas the L2 norm is more suitable
for a random input signal. Scaling coefﬁcients can be imple-
mented by simple shift operations provided they satisfy the
overﬂow constraints.
