Notice that figure 3-6 is the mirror image of figure 3-4. In figure 3-6 the left side of capacitor C2 
becomes more negative at a rate determined by the time constant R3C2. As the left side of C2 becomes 
more negative, the base of Q1 also becomes more negative. When the base of Q1 becomes negative 
enough to allow Q1 to conduct, Q1 will again go into saturation. The resulting change in voltage at output 
1 will cause Q2 to return to the cutoff state.
