Problems involving the determination of resistance, voltage, current, and power in a parallel circuit
are solved as simply as in a series circuit. The procedure is the same â€” (1) draw the circuit diagram, (2)
state the values given and the values to be found, (3) select the equations to be used in solving for the
unknown quantities based upon the known quantities, and (4) substitute the known values in the equation
you have selected and solve for the unknown value.
