It is of interest to note that in IS-95, the number of users per data channel is not speciÔ¨Åed in Table 75.8. This
is due to the fact that such a quantity is not easy to derive for all conditions, due to a number of factors. The
downlink  for  IS-95  provides  two  forms  of  user  channelization,  based  on  spreading  sequence  time  offsets  and
Walsh codes. However, spreading sequence offsets alone provide uplink channelization. Moreover, both the uplink
and downlink are interference-limited, due to multiple users occupying the same frequency band simultaneously.
