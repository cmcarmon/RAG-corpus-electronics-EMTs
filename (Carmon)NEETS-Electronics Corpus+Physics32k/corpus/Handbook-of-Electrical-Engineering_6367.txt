(1) the threshold of human hearing, and (2) masking of nearby frequency components. In the early days of
hearing  research,  Harvey  Fletcher,  a  researcher  at  Bell  Laboratories,  measured  the  hearing  of  many  human
beings  and  published  the  well-known  Fletcher-Munson  threshold-of-hearing  chart.  Basically  it  states  that,
depending on the frequency, audio sounds below certain levels cannot be heard by the human ear. Further, the
masking  effect,  simply  stated,  is  when  two  frequencies  are  very  close  to  each  other  and  one  is  a  higher  level
than the other, the weaker of the two is masked and will not be heard. These two principles allow for as much
as 80% of the data representing a musical signal to be discarded.
