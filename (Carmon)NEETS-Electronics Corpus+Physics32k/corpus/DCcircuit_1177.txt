A fuse is nothing more than a short length of wire designed to melt and separate in the
event of excessive current. Fuses are always connected in series with the component(s) to be
protected from overcurrent, so that when the fuse blows (opens) it will open the entire circuit
and stop current through the component(s). A fuse connected in one branch of a parallel circuit,
of course, would not affect current through any of the other branches.
