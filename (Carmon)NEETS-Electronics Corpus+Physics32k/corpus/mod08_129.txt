In view (A) a common-emitter transistor amplifier is shown. An emitter resistor (R2) has been 
placed in this circuit to provide proper biasing and temperature stability. An undesired effect of this 
resistor is the development of a signal at the emitter in phase with the input signal on the base. This signal 
is caused by the changing current through the emitter resistor (R2) as the current through the transistor 
changes. You might think that this signal on the emitter is a form of positive feedback since it is in phase 
with the input signal. But the emitter signal is really negative feedback. Current through the transistor is 
controlled by the base-to-emitter bias. If both the base and emitter become more positive by the same 
amount at the same time, current will not increase. It is the difference between the base and emitter 
voltages that controls the current flow through the transistor.
