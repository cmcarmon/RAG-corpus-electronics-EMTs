Computer simulation provides you with a powerful 
and  cost-effective  tool  for  designing,  simulating, 
and analysing a wide variety of electronic circuits. 
In  recent  years,  the  computer  software  packages 
designed  for  this  task  have  not  only  become 
increasingly  sophisticated  but  also  have  become 
increasingly  easy  to  use.  Furthermore,  several  of 
the  most  powerful  and  popular  packages  are  now 
available  at  low  cost  either  in  evaluation,  ‘lite’  or 
student  versions.  In  addition,  there  are  several 
excellent  freeware  and  shareware  packages  (see 
Appendix 7). 
  Whereas  early  electronic  simulation  software 
required that circuits were entered using a complex 
netlist  that  described  all  of  the  components  and
