Liquid-ring systems can be single- or multistage. Typically a multistage pump will have up to two compression stages on a common shaft. In vacuum service, the attainable pressure reduction is limited by the vapour pressure of the ring-liquid. As the generated vacuum approaches the vapour pressure of the ring-liquid, the increasing volume of vapor released from the ring-liquid diminishes the remaining vacuum capacity. The efficiency of the system declines as a result.
Single-stage vacuum pumps typically produce vacuum to 35 Torr (mm Hg) or 47 millibars (4.7 kPa), and two-stage pumps can produce vacuum to 25 Torr, assuming air is being pumped and the ring-liquid is water at 15 °C (60 °F) or less. Dry air and 15 °C sealant-water temperature is the standard performance basis, which most manufacturers use for their performance curves.
