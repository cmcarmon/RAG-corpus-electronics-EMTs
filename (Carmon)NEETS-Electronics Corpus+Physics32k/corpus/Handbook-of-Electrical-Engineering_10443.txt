Convergence
Now, what happens with the family of models when the amount of information increases? It is desirable to
produce a “smaller” set of models as input data increases, i.e., model uncertainty should decrease. The set of
models  are  expected  to  tend  to  the  real  system  when  the  uncertainty  of  the  input  information  goes  to  zero.
Hence, an identiﬁcation algorithm A is said to be convergent when its worst-case global identiﬁcation error
