Two theories are used to explain the breakdown action of Zener diodes. The ZENER EFFECT 
explains the breakdown of diodes below 5 volts. The heavy doping used in these diodes allows the 
valence band of one material to overlap the energy level of the conduction band of the other material. 
This situation allows electrons to tunnel across the PN junction at the point where the two energy bands 
overlap. Zener diodes that operate above 5 volts are explained by the AVALANCHE EFFECT in which 
free electrons colliding with bound electrons cause an ever-increasing number of free current carriers in a 
multiplying action. The Zener diode is used primarily as a voltage regulator in electronic circuits.
