Alternators are connected in parallel to (1) increase the output capacity of a system beyond that of a
single unit, (2) serve as additional reserve power for expected demands, or (3) permit shutting down one
machine and cutting in a standby machine without interrupting power distribution. When alternators are
of sufficient size, and are operating at different frequencies and terminal voltages, severe damage may
result if they are suddenly connected to each other through a common bus. To avoid this, the machines
must be synchronized as closely as possible before connecting them together. This may be accomplished
by connecting one generator to the bus (referred to as bus generator), and then synchronizing the other
(incoming generator) to it before closing the incoming generatorâ€™s main power contactor. The generators
are synchronized when the following conditions are set:
