The DUPLEXER is a device that allows the same antenna to both transmit and receive. Most
duplexers use the impedance characteristics of transmission lines and waveguides in conjunction with TR
and ATR tubes to route the energy to the correct place. One of the most important functions of the
duplexer is isolation of the receiver during transmission.
