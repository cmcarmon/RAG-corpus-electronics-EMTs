across capacitor C2 that is three times the peak value. 
The top plate of capacitor C2 has a positive peak value 
of two times the peak value. The anode of diode D3 
has a positive value of three times the peak value with 
respect to ground. This charges capacitor C3 to three 
times the peak value. This is the voltage that is applied 
to the load.
