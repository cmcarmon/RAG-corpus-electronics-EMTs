The proof of this theorem uses ideas of random coding and long block lengths as in the proof of the channel
capacity theorem. The basic idea is to generate a code book of 2nR reproduction code words Ë†Xn at random and
show that for long block lengths, for any source sequence, it is very likely that there is at least one code word
in this code book that is within distortion D of that source sequence. See Gallager [1968] or Cover and Thomas
[1991] for details of the proof.
