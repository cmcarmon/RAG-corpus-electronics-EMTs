Edge Elements
Using potentials and nodal ﬁnite elements (see Fig. 44.1) rather than ﬁeld components directly has the advantage
that difﬁculties arising from ﬁeld discontinuities at material interfaces can be avoided. However, if the element
, say) constrained along an element edge,
basis functions [see Eq. (44.5)] are expressed in terms of the ﬁeld (
then tangential ﬁeld continuity is enforced [Bossavit, 1988]. The ﬁeld equations [Eq. (44.1)] in terms of the
ﬁeld intensity for the low frequency limit reduce to
