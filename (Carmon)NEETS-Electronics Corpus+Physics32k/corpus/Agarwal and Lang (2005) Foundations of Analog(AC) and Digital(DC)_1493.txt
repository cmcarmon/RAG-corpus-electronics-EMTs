Thus the total driven capacitance must be less than 1.08 pF. Suppose the invert-
ers used in the clock buffer tree are identical to the clock driver inverters, then
if the value of each gate capacitor is 100 fF, the maximum fanout degree must
be less than 1080 fF / 100 fF. Thus the maximum fanout degree is 10.
