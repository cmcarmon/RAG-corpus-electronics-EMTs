The voltmeterâ€™s internal resistance is connected in 
parallel with the component being measured. The to-
tal resistance of resistors in parallel is always less than 
that of the smallest resistor. As a result, the voltage 
read by the voltmeter is smaller than the actual voltage 
across the component. In most cases, the internal re-
sistance of a voltmeter is high, so the error is small and 
can be ignored. However, if voltage is being measured 
in a high-resistance circuit, meter resistance may have 
a noticeable effect. Some voltmeters are designed with 
extra-high internal resistance for such purposes.
