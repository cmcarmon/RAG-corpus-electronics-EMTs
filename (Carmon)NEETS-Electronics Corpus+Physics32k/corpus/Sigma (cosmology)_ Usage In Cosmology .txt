The NUKER team calculated the sigma of several stars in different galaxies and the mass of the black hole at the (nucleus) centre. They expected no correlation what so ever. But when plotting their results on a Scatter diagram and drawing a line of best fit they ended up with a positive correlation. It appeared that the heavier the black hole at the centre was the faster the stars within the galaxy travelled.
This property helped them realise that a Supermassive black hole nucleus must be the reason for the galaxies in some way. They saw that the clouds of gas before the galaxies compressed forming a black hole, the black hole would produce phenomenal amounts of energy which would force the rest of the galaxy away and form stars.
Sigma comes into use when the black hole gets heavier from the increased mass. The stars at the edge of the newly formed galaxy were spinning around at high speeds. The faster they were travelling, the heavier the black hole would have to be to force them away. Then once everything had been moved away from it the black hole stops feeding. The correlation above has been proved by the process of galactic creation. (see Galaxies)
