This method solves the problem of excessive storage for the training speaker models because the number of
clusters is far fewer than the number of training speakers, and it is relatively inexpensive to store a model for
each cluster. Also, as each cluster contains a number of speakers, we have enough data to robustly estimate the
parameters of the model for the cluster.
