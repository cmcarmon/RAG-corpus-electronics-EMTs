practical purposes, there is no output developed across the load resistor during the negative alternation of
the input signal as indicated by the broken lines in the figure. Although only one cycle of input is shown,
it should be realized that the action described above continually repeats itself, as long as there is an input.
Therefore, since only the positive half-cycles appear at the output this circuit converted the ac input into a
positive pulsating dc voltage. The frequency of the output voltage is equal to the frequency of the applied
ac signal since there is one pulse out for each cycle of the ac input. For example, if the input frequency is
60 hertz (60 cycles per second), the output frequency is 60 pulses per second (pps).
