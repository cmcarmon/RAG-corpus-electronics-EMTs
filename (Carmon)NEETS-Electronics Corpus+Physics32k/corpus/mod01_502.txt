By inspecting the circuit, you can see that R2 is the same ohmic value as R1 and carries the same
current. The voltage drop across R2 is therefore also equal to 10 volts. Adding these two 10-volts drops
together gives a total drop of 20 volts, exactly equal to the applied voltage. For a series circuit then:
