You have learned to use letters and letter combinations to abbreviate or symbolize electrical
quantities. (The letters E, I, and R are examples.) We will continue this practice in referring to tube
quantities. You should be aware that other publications may use different abbreviations. Many attempts
have been made to standardize such abbreviations, inside the Navy and out. None have succeeded
completely.
