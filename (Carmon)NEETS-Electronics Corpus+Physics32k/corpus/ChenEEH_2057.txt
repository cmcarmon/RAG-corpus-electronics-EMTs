The semantics of temporal logic is deﬁned on inﬁnite se-
quences of states that are extracted from the execution sequences
of PrTNs, where the last marking of a ﬁnite execution se-
quence is repeated inﬁnitely many times at the end of the
execution sequence. For example, for an execution sequence
M0[X0> M1[X1> . . .M n, the following inﬁnite sequence be-
havior s ¼ << M0 . . .M n, Mn, . . . >> is obtained. We denote
the set of all possible behaviors obtained from a given PrTN as
St1. Let u and v be two arbitrary temporal formulas; p be an m-
ary place; t be a transition; x, x1 . . ., xn be rigid variables;
s ¼ << M0, M1, . . . >> be a behavior; and sk ¼ << Mk,
Mkþ1, . . . >> be a k-step-shifted behavior sequence. We deﬁne
the semantics of temporal formulas recursively as follows:
