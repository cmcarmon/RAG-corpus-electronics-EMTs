The ECG is displayed by a direct-writing pen that employs a heated stylus writing on thermosensitive paper.
Two chart speeds are used, 25 and 50 mm/s. The rulings on the paper represent 40 ms when the standard speed
(25  mm/s)  is  used.  The  amplitude  sensitivity  is  10  mm  for  a  1-mV  input  signal.  The  sinusoidal  frequency
response extends from 0.05 to 100 Hz for the 30% attenuation points. The input stage is a differential ampliÔ¨Åer
with an input impedance in excess of 2.4 MW The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is measured with
a 20-V (rms) 60-Hz generator with an output impedance of 51,000 W connected in series with a 10-pF capacitor.
The 60-Hz CMRR should be in excess of 5000. The maximum dc leakage current through any patient electrode
is 0.2 mA.
