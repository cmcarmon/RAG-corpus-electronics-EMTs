A recent trend has been the ever increasing density of dynamic random access memory (DRAM). The storage
capacitor in these devices is becoming a major limiting factor because the dielectric has to be very thin in order
to achieve the desired capacitance values to yield, in turn, a sufﬁcient signal for the storage cell. It is often also
desirable to have nonvolatile operation (no data loss on power loss). These two desires have, probably more
than anything else, driven the development of high epsilon and FE thin ﬁlms. Of course, these are not the only
applications of FE ﬁlms. Table 49.3 lists the applications of FE (nonvolatile, NV) and high epsilon ﬁlms (volatile)
and highlights which of the properties are important for their use. It is seen that the memory application is
very  demanding.  Satisfying  all  these  requirements  simultaneously  has  produced  signiﬁcant  challenges  in  the
manufacture of these ﬁlms.
