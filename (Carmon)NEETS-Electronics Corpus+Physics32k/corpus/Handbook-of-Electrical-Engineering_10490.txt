By deﬁnition, control workload is highest when the operator’s full attention is required for control purposes
and when this attention is focused on only the most critical input information needed for closed-loop control.
For this reason the full-attention crossover model and remnant for compensatory behavior treated above has
received the major attention here. Estimates and considerations based on full-attention compensatory assumptions
will  generally  be  conservative.  For  instance,  the  dynamic  performance  of  the  overall  man-machine  system  will
typically be improved when additional cues and information provide the basis for the generation of pursuit behavior.
