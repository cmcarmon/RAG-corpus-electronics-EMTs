it appears that the analysis and behavior of a second-
order circuit containing two independent capacitors is identical to that of a
second-order circuit containing one capacitor and one inductor. The same
conclusion is reached by examining a circuit containing two independent induc-
tors. While this conclusion is largely true, there is one important difference
