Figure 4-7 shows one type of fiber polishing tool for finishing optical fibers in a connector assembly.
Various types of connector assemblies are discussed later in this chapter. In this type of polishing tool, the
connector assembly is threaded onto the polishing tool. The connector ferrule passes through the center of
the tool allowing the fiber-end face to extend below the tool's circular, flat bottom. The optical fiber is
now ready for polishing.
