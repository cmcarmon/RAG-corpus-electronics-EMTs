The electron rest mass (symbol: me) is the mass of a stationary electron. It is one of the fundamental constants of physics and is also very important in chemistry because of its relation to the Avogadro constant. It has a value of about 9.10×10−31 kilograms or about 5.486×10−4 atomic mass units, equivalent to an energy of about 8.19×10−14 joules or about 0.511 megaelectronvolts.
