All solutions in these coordinate systems must be expressible
as sums of these harmonics. The method of constructing the
solution is (1) assume the solution has the form of the inﬁnite
sum, independently, in every region in which the material
properties are constant; (2) eliminate the terms in the sums
of harmonics that would cause inﬁnities to appear in the given
regions; (3) enforce satisfaction of the boundary conditions
across every boundary connecting the regions by setting the
potentials on either side and the normal D ﬁelds equal to each
other; and (4) solve for the arbitrary constants. Once the
constants are found, according to the uniqueness theorem,
the solution has been found.
