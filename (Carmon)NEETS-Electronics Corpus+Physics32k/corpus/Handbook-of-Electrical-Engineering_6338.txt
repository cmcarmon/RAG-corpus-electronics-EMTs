Digital audio broadcasting (DAB) is a developing technology that promises to give consumers a new and better
aural broadcast system. DAB will offer dramatically better reception quality over existing AM and FM broadcasts
by better audio quality and by superior resistance to interference in stationary and mobile/portable reception
environments. Additionally, the availability of a digital data stream direct to consumers will open the prospects
of providing extra services to augment basic sound delivery.
