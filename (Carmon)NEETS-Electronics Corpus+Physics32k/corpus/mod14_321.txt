To add two numbers using this circuit, the addend and augend are applied to the A and B inputs. The
B inputs are applied to one input of the X-OR gates. A control signal is applied to the other input of the
X-OR gates. When the control signal is LOW, the circuit will add; and when it is HIGH, the circuit will
subtract.
