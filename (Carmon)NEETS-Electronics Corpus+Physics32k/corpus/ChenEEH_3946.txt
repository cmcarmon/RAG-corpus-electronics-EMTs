K
i¼1 xi turns out to be
the sufﬁcient statistic for estimating S, as shown in Section
6.4.2. This should not be surprising as detection of a constant
signal in noise is a dual problem of estimating the mean of the
observations.
Under the iid Gaussian assumption, the test statistic is clearly
a Gaussian random variable. Furthermore, E{T (X)jH0} ¼ 0,
E{T (X)jH1}¼ KS, and Var{T (X)jH0}¼ Var{T (X)jH1}¼ K s 2.
The pdf of T (x) plotted in Figure 6.1, can be written as:
