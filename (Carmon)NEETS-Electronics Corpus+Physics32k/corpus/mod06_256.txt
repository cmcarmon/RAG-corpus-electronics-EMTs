Notice that there are three interelectrode capacitances involved in a triode. The capacitance between
the plate and grid, designated Cpg, is the largest, because of the relatively large area of the plate, and
therefore has the greatest effect on triode operation. The grid-to-cathode capacitance is designated Ckg.
