For our discussion of light wave waves, we will use the millimicron measurement. The wavelength
of a light determines the color of the light. Figure 1-18 indicates that light with a wavelength of 700
millimicrons is red, and that light with a wavelength of 500 millimicrons is blue-green. This illustration
shows approximate wavelengths of the different colors in the visible spectrum. In actual fact, the color of
light depends on its frequency, not its wavelength. However, light is measured in wavelengths.
