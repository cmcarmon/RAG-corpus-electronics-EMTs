The ﬁeld of active ﬁlter design remains active, and new developments appear in IEEE Transactions on Circuits
and Systems and IEE Proceedings Part G (Circuits and Systems). The IEE publication Electronic Letters provides
for short contributions. A number of international conferences (whose proceedings can be borrowed through
technical libraries) feature active ﬁlter and related sessions, notably the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits
and Systems (ISCAS) and the European Conference on Circuit Theory and Design (ECCTD).
