Each multimeter comes with a pair of test leads: 
one black (for the ground connection) and one 
red (for the positive connection). On small pocket 
units, the test leads are permanently attached 
to the meters, whereas on larger models, you 
can unplug the leads. Each test lead has a cone‚Äê
shaped metal tip used for probing circuits. You 
can also purchase test clips that slip over the 
tips, making testing much easier because you can 
attach these clips onto wires or component leads.
