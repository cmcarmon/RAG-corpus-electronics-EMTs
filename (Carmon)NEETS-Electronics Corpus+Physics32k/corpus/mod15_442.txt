IC SYNCHROSâ€”Electromechanical devices, used to transmit information, that operate on the
same principles of interacting magnetic fields as synchros, but differ in their direction of
rotation and the amount of torque obtainable. Because of their construction, they are
sometimes called reversed synchros.
