The designation refers to the polarity of the majority charge carriers in the bar of semi-
conductor that connects the drain terminal D to the source terminal S. Since the channel is
formed from a single-polarity (unipolar) material, its resistance is a function only of the ge-
ometry of the conducting volume and the conductivity of the material. The JFET operates
with all PN junctions reverse-biased so as to obtain a high input impedance into the gate.
