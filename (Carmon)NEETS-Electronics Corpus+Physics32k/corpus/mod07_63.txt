When it comes to ruggedness and life expectancy, the tube is still in competition. Design and
functional requirements usually dictate the choice of device. However, semiconductor devices are rugged
and long-lived. They can be constructed to withstand extreme vibration and mechanical shock. They have
been known to withstand impacts that would completely shatter an ordinary electron tube. Although some
specially designed tubes render extensive service, the life expectancy of transistors is better than three to
four times that of ordinary electronic tubes. There is no known failure mechanism (such as an open
filament in a tube) to limit the semiconductorâ€™s life. However, semiconductor devices do have some
limitations. They are usually affected more by temperature, humidity, and radiation than tubes are.
