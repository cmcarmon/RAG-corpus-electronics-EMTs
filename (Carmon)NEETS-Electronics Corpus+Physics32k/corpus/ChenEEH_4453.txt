The construction of such models is not straightforward.
Often due to data and experimental limitations, the modeling
process does not yield a single exact model but a range of
possible models. The full model may also be too complex to
allow a full Kalman Ô¨Ålter implementation with online covar-
iance propagation. Even when the full implementation is pos-
sible, additional analysis may show that nearly equivalent and
possibly more robust performance can be achieved with fewer
computations for an implementation using a reduced order
model.
