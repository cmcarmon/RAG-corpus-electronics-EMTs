When calculating the output impedance we still assumed an inﬁnite input impedance. In
this section we will calculate the ﬁnite input impedance assuming a zero output impedance.
We consider a model that assumes an internal resistor RT connecting the inverting and
non-inverting input terminals of the op-amp as shown in ﬁgure 6.31
