The addition of skew rays also increases the amount of loss in a fiber. Skew rays tend to propagate
near the edge of the fiber core. A large portion of the number of skew rays that are trapped in the fiber
core are considered to be leaky rays. Leaky rays are predicted to be totally reflected at the core-cladding
boundary. However, these rays are partially refracted because of the curved nature of the fiber boundary.
Mode theory is also used to describe this type of leaky ray loss.
