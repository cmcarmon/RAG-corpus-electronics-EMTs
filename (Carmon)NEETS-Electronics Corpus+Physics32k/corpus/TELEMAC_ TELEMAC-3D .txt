It 3D hydrodynamics module, TELEMAC-3D, uses the same horizontally unstructured mesh as TELEMAC-2D but solves the Navier-Stokes equations, whether in hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic mode so allowing shorter waves than those in a shallow water context (where wavelengths are required to be at least twenty times the water depth). The wave formulation for the updating of the free surface is used for efficiency. The 3D mesh is developed as a series of meshed surfaces between the bed and the free surface surface. Flexibility in the placement of these planes permits the use of a sigma grid (each plane at a given proportion of the spacing between bed and surface) or a number of other strategies for intermediate surface location. One useful example is to include some planes which are at a fixed distance below the water surface, or above the bed. In the presence of a near surface thermocline or halocline this is advantageous in so far as mixing water between the near surface planes, where the greatest density gradients are located, can be avoided. When drying occurs the water depth falls to zero exactly and the planes collapse to a zero inter-layer spacing.
