An example of the use of this theorem in physics is the law of conservation of mass for fluids, which states that the mass of any fluid volume must not change:







d

∫


V

t
)


d

Ω
=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}\int \limits _{V_{f}}\rho ({\vec {x}},t)\,\mathrm {d} \Omega =0}

Applying the Reynolds transport theorem, one can change the reference to an arbitrary (non-fluid) control volume Vc. Further assuming that the density function is continuous (i.e. that our fluid is monophasic and thermodynamically metastable) and that Vc is not moving relative to the chosen system of reference, the equation becomes:





∫


V

d

Ω
=
0


{\displaystyle \int \limits _{V_{c}}\left[{{\partial \rho } \over {\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho {\vec {v}})\right]\,\mathrm {d} \Omega =0}

As the equation holds for any such control volume, the localization theorem applies, rendering the common partial differential equation for the conservation of mass in monophase fluids:
