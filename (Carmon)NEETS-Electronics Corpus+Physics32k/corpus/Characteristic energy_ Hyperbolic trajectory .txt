A spacecraft that is leaving the central body on a hyperbolic trajectory has more than enough energy to escape:





C

=

μ
a


,


{\displaystyle C_{3}=-{\frac {\mu }{a}},}

where




μ
=
G
M


{\displaystyle \mu =GM}
is the standard gravitational parameter,




a


{\displaystyle a}
is the semi-major axis of the orbit's hyperbola (which is negative by convention).
Also,





C

=

v

2


,


{\displaystyle C_{3}=v_{\infty }^{2},}

where




v

∞




{\displaystyle v_{\infty }}
is the asymptotic velocity at infinite distance. Spacecraft's velocity approaches




v

∞




{\displaystyle v_{\infty }}
as it is further away from the central object's gravity.
