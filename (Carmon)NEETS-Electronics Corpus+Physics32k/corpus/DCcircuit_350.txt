One practical precaution a person could take if they see a power line falling towards the
ground is to only contact the ground at one point, either by running away (when you run, only
one foot contacts the ground at any given time), or if there’s nowhere to run, by standing on one
foot. Obviously, if there’s somewhere safer to run, running is the best option. By eliminating
two points of contact with the ground, there will be no chance of applying deadly voltage across
the body through both legs.
