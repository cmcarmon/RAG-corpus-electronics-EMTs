Propagation of an EM wave may be regarded as a means of transferring energy or information from one
point (a transmitter) to another (a receiver). EM wave propagation is achieved through guided structures such
as transmission lines and waveguides or through space. Wave propagation through waveguides and microstrip
lines will be treated in Section 37.2. In this section, our major focus is on EM wave propagation in space and
the power resident in the wave.
