Source encoder:  A device that substantially reduces the data rate of linearly digitized audio signals by taking
advantage of the psychoacoustic properties of human hearing, eliminating redundant and subjectively
irrelevant  information  from  the  output  signal.  Transform  source  encoders  work  entirely  within  the
frequency  domain,  while  time-domain  source  encoders  work  primarily  in  the  time  domain.  Source
decoders reverse the process, using various masking techniques to simulate the properties of the original
linear data.
