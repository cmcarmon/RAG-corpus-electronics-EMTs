Another  common  example  is  the  appearance  of  triplen  harmonics.  Asymmetrical  voltages,  when  using  a
common ﬁring angle control for all the valves, result in current pulse width differences between the three phases
which produce triplen harmonics. To prevent this effect, modern large power converters use the equidistant ﬁring
concept instead [Ainsworth, 1968]. However, this controller cannot eliminate second harmonic amplitude mod-
ulation of
the dc current which, via the converter modulation process, returns third harmonic current of positive
sequence. This current can ﬂow through the converter transformer regardless of its connection and penetrate far
into the ac system. Again, the presence of triplen harmonics is discouraged by stricter limits in the regulations.
