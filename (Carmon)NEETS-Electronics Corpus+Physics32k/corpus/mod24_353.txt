In any system, index matching gels can be used to eliminate or reduce Fresnel reflection. The choice
of index matching gels is important. Fiber-to-fiber connections are designed to be permanent and require
no maintenance. Over the lifetime of the fiber connection, the index matching material must meet specific
optical and mechanical requirements. Index matching gels should remain transparent. They should also
resist flowing or dripping by remaining viscous. Some index matching gels darken over time while others
settle or leak out of fiber connections. If these requirements are not met, then the fiber-to-fiber connection
loss will increase over time. In Navy applications, this variation in connection loss over time is
unacceptable. In Navy systems, index matching gels are only used in fiber optic splice interfaces.
