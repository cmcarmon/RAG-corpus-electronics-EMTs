In theoretical physics, Nielsenâ€“Olsen string is a one-dimensional object or equivalently a classical solution of certain equations of motion. The solution does not depend on the direction along the string; the dependence on the other two, transverse dimensions is identical as in the case of a Nielsen-Olsen vortex.
