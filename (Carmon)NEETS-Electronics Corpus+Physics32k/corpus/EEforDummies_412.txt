Capacitance is measured in units called farads. One farad (abbreviated F) is 
defined as the capacitance needed to get one amp of current to flow when 
the voltage changes at a rate of one volt per second. Don’t worry about the 
details of the definition; just know that one farad is a humongous amount of 
capacitance. You’re more likely to run across capacitors with much smaller 
capacitance values — hovering in the microfarad (μF) or picofarad (pF) 
range. A microfarad is a millionth of a farad, or 0.000001 farad, and a picofarad 
is a millionth of a millionth of a farad, or 0.000000000001 farad.
