Delay, as the second parameter, speciÔ¨Åes the maximum
delay observed by a data unit on an end-to-end transmission
(Furht, 1994). The delay encountered in transmitting the
elements of a multimedia object stream can vary from one
element to the next. This delay variance can take two forms:
delay jitter and delay skew. Jitter implies that in an object
stream, the actual presentation times of various objects shift
with respect to their desired presentation times. The effect of
jitter on an object stream is shown in Figure 7.3. In Figure
7.3(A), each arrow represents the position of an object that is
equally spaced in time. In Figure 3(B), the dotted arrows
represent the desired positions of the objects, and the solid
arrows represent their actual positions. It can be seen in Figure
3(B) that these objects are randomly displaced from their
original positions. This effect is called jitter in the timing of
