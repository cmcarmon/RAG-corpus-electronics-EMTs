Basically, the power meter circuit consists of two bridges; each bridge includes one of the thermistor 
elements as a bridge arm. The bridges are made self-balancing through the use of feedback loops. Positive 
or regenerative feedback is used in feedback loop 1; degenerative (negative) feedback is used in feedback
