Pure longitudinal and shear waves (modes): Ultrasonic plane waves in which the particle motion is parallel
or perpendicular, respectively, to the wave vector and for which energy ï¬‚ow is parallel to the wave vector.
Slowness surface: A plot of the reciprocal of the phase velocity as a function of direction in an anisotropic
