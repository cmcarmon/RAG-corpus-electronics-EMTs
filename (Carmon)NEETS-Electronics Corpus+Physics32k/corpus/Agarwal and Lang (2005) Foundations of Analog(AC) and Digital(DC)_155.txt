The linear resistor is but one example of a larger class of resistive elements.
In particular, resistors need not be linear; they can be nonlinear as well. In
general, a two-terminal resistor is any two-terminal element that has an alge-
braic relation between its instantaneous terminal current and its instantaneous
terminal voltage. Such a resistor could be linear or nonlinear, time-invariant or
time-varying. For example, elements characterized by the following element
relationships are all general resistors:
