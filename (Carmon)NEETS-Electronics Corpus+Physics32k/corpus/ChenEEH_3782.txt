Not unexpectedly, the training procedures for such an
embedded system of models require some enhancement and
reconsideration of methods applied to the simple word
models. Nevertheless, the basic ideas are the same, and the
same F–B and Viterbi reestimation algorithms are applicable.
One remarkable property of the HMM is evident in the
training process. In working with continuous speech, we
must face the problem of not knowing where the temporal
boundaries (i.e., phonetic or word) are in the acoustic obser-
vation strings used for training (or recognition). The creation
of sufﬁciently large databases marked according to phonetic
is generally impractical. An important
