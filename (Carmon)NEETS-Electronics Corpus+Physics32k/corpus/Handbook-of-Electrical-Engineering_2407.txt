Depletion Effects in Thin Films
Surface  states  as  well  as  ﬁlm/substrate  interface  states  can  deplete  a  thin  ﬁlm  of  a  signiﬁcant  fraction  of  its
charge  carriers.  Suppose  these  states  lead  to  surface  and  interface  potentials  of φ
i,  respectively.  Then,
regions of width ws and wi will be depleted of their free carriers, where
