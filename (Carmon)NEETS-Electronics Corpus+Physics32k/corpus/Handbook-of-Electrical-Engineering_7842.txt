(a)  Thermomagnetic  recording  by  magnetic  ﬁeld  modulation.  The  power  of  the  beam  is  kept  constant,
while the magnetic ﬁeld direction is switched by the data signal. (b) Polarized-light microphotograph of recorded domains.
(c)  Computed  isotherms  produced  by  a  CW  laser  beam,  focused  on  the  magnetic  layer  of  a  disk.  The  disk  moves  with
constant velocity under the beam. The region inside the isotherm marked as Tcrit is above the critical temperature for writing,
that is, its magnetization aligns with the direction of the applied ﬁeld. (d) Magnetization within the heated region (above
Tcrit) follows the direction of the applied ﬁeld, whose switchings occur at times tn. The resulting domains are crescent-shaped.
