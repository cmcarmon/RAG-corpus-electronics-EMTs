A MOSFET amplifier circuit is shown in Figure 7.19. Remarkably, this circuit
is identical to the inverter circuit we saw earlier! Unlike the inverter circuit,
however, the input and output voltages of the MOSFET amplifier must be
carefully chosen so that the MOSFET operates in its saturation region. In the
saturation region of operation, the SCS model can be used to analyze the
MOSFET amplifier. Constraining the inputs so that the MOSFET is always
in saturation results in the desired amplifier behavior, and furthermore, it sig-
nificantly simplifies our analysis. This constraint on how we use a MOSFET
amplifier is yet another example of a discipline to which we adhere in circuit
design and analysis. This discipline is called the saturation discipline and is
discussed further in Section 7.5.2.
