practice, this means that a static value of collector 
current  will  flow  even  when  there  is  no  signal 
present.  Furthermore,  the  collector  current  will 
flow  throughout  the  complete  cycle  of  an  input 
signal (i.e. conduction will take place over an angle 
of  360Â°).  At  no  stage  will  the  transistor  be 
saturated nor should it be cut-off (i.e. the state in 
which no collector current flows).  
 
In order to ensure that a static value of collector 
current  flows  in  a  transistor,  a  small  current  must 
therefore  be  applied  to  the  base  of  the  transistor. 
This current can be derived from the same voltage 
rail that supplies the collector circuit (via the load). 
Figure  7.31  shows  a  simple  Class  A  common- 
emitter  amplifier  circuit  in  which  the  base  bias 
resistor,  R1,  and  collector  load  resistor,  R2,  are 
connected to a common positive supply rail.
