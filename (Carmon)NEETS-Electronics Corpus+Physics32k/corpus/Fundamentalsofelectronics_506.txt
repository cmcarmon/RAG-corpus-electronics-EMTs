Problem 4.25: Novel AM Stereo Method
A clever engineer has submitted a patent for a new method for transmitting two signals simultaneously
in the same transmission bandwidth as commercial AM radio. As shown in Figure 4.33, her approach is to
modulate the positive portion of the carrier with one signal and the negative portion with a second. In detail
