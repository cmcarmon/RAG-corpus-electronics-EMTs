The dB scales can be used for a standing-wave-ratio measurement by setting the meter to full scale at
a voltage maximum, then turning the RANGE-DB switch clockwise for an on-scale reading at a voltage
minimum and noting the difference in dB reading at the maximum and minimum. A dB reading is
obtained by adding the RANGE-DB switch setting and meter indication. The swr meter may also be used
for high resolution insertion loss measurements.
