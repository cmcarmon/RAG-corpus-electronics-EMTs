obtained from a test chart with a charge coupled device (CCD) camera. The function key F3 selects the
1-MHz low-pass ﬁlter resulting in the display shown in Fig. 18.12. The 3-MHz ﬁlter (with F4) would
pass more of the higher-frequency components of the signal but with less noise reduction. F5 implements
the noise averaging algorithm. The effect of the edge enhancement algorithm (with F7) is displayed in
Fig. 18.13.
