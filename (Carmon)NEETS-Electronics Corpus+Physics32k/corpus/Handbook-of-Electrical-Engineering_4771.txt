PZT (PbZrxTi(1–x)O3) is an example of a ceramic material which is ferroelectric. We will use PZT as a prototype
system for many of the ferroelectric attributes to be discussed. The concepts, of course, have general validity.
The structure of this material is ABO3 where A is lead and B is one or the other atoms, Ti or Zr. This material
consists of many randomly oriented crystallites which vary in size between approximately 10 nm and several
microns.  The  crystalline  symmetry  of  the  material  is  determined  by  the  magnitude  of  the  parameter x.  The
material changes from rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry when x > 0.48. This transition is almost inde-
pendent  of  temperature.  The  line  which  divides  the  two  phases  is  called  a  morphotropic  phase  boundary
(change of symmetry as a function of composition only). Commercial materials are made with x » 0.48, where
the d and g sensitivity of the material is maximum. It is clear from Table 49.2 that there are other parameters
which can be inﬂuenced as well. Doping the material with donors or acceptors often changes the properties
dramatically.  Thus  niobium  is  important  to  obtain  higher  sensitivity  and  resistivity  and  to  lower  the  Curie
temperature.  PZT  typically  is  a  p-type  conductor  and  niobium  will  signiﬁcantly  decrease  the  conductivity
because of the electron which Nb5+ contributes to the lattice. The Nb ion substitutes for the B-site ion Ti4+ or
Zr4+. The resistance to depolarization (the hardness of the material) is affected by iron doping. Hardness is a
deﬁnition giving the relative resistance to depolarization. It should not be confused with mechanical hardness.
Many other dopants and admixtures have been used, often in very exotic combinations to affect aging, sensi-
tivity, etc.
