Reduced-Rank Approximation
In various applications, it is frequently desired to ﬁnd a matrix of rank q that best approximates a given matrix
A ˛  C m · n, where q < rank {A}. If the Frobenius metric (14.66) is used to measure the distance between two
matrices, it is well known that the best rank-q matrix approximation of A is obtained by simply dropping all
but the q largest singular-valued weighted outer products in SVD representation (14.101), that is,
