When the AC voltage is applied, the rectified line voltage is applied across C1 and C2, as they are both charged via D3 and R1, until C1 and C2 are each charged up to approximately half of the peak line voltage. When the line voltage falls below the peak, into the "valley" phase, Vout begins to fall toward half of the peak line voltage. At this point, C1 and C2 begin to discharge into the load at Vout, via D1 and D2 respectively. R1 is needed to prevent a large in-rush current, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
