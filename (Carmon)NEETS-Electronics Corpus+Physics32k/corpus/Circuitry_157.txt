where Vs is the d.c. supply voltage, t is the time, R
is  the  series  resistance  and  C is  the  value  of 
capacitance.  
  The current will fall to approximately 37% of the 
initial current in a time equal to the time constant. 
At the end of the next interval of time equal to the 
time  constant  (i.e.  after  a  total  time  of  2CR  has 
elapsed)  the  current  will  have  fallen  by  a  further 
37% of the remainder, and so on. 
 
Example 3.9 
 
An  initially  uncharged  1  ÂµF  capacitor  is  charged 
from  a  9  V  d.c.  supply  via  a  3.3  MF resistor. 
Determine 
the  capacitor  voltage  1  s  after 
connecting the supply. 
 
Solution 
 
The  formula  for  exponential  growth  of  voltage  in 
the capacitor is:
