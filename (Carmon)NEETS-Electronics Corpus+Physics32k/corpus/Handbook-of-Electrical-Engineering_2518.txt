This is the straight-line equation to the dc load-line (compare y = mx + c), showing that its slope is –1/(RC +
RE) and that it crosses the IC axis at VCC/(RC + RE) as expected. The actual position of a point is determined
by where this load line crosses the output characteristic in use, that is, by what value of VBE or IB is chosen. For
example, the quiescent point for the transistor is where the load line crosses the output curve deﬁned by VBE =
VBEQ (or IB = IBQ) to give VCE = VQ and IC = IQ.
