by a MOSFET with its gate tied to its drain, operating under the saturation discipline,
with parameters VT and K.
e x e r c i s e 8.3 Develop the small-signal model for a two-terminal device formed
between the drain and source terminals of a MOSFET with a 2 volt DC source connected
between its gate and source terminals (VGS = 2 V). Assume the MOSFET operates
under the saturation discipline. Assume further that VT = 1 volt for the MOSFET.
e x e r c i s e 8.4 Consider the MOSFET amplifier shown in Figure 8.50. Assume
that the amplifier is operated under the saturation discipline. In its saturation region, the
MOSFET is characterized by the equation
iDS = K
