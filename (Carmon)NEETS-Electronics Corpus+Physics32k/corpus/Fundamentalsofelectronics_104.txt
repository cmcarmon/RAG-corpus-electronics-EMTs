It is important to understand the physics of current ﬂow in conductors to appreciate the innovation of
new electronic devices. Electric charge can arise from many sources, the simplest being the electron. When
we say that “electrons ﬂow through a conductor,” what we mean is that the conductor’s constituent atoms
freely give up electrons from their outer shells. “Flow” thus means that electrons hop from atom to atom
driven along by the applied electric potential. A missing electron, however, is a virtual positive charge.
Electrical engineers call these holes, and in some materials, particularly certain semiconductors, current
ﬂow is actually due to holes. Current ﬂow also occurs in nerve cells found in your brain. Here, neurons
“communicate” using propagating voltage pulses that rely on the ﬂow of positive ions (potassium and sodium
primarily, and to some degree calcium) across the neuron’s outer wall. Thus, current can come from many
sources, and circuit theory can be used to understand how current ﬂows in reaction to electric ﬁelds.
