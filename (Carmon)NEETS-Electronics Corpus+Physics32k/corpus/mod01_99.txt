One of the easiest ways to create a static charge is by friction. When two pieces of matter are rubbed
together, electrons can be "wiped off" one material onto the other. If the materials used are good
conductors, it is quite difficult to obtain a detectable charge on either, since equalizing currents can flow
easily between the conducting materials. These currents equalize the charges almost as fast as they are
created. A static charge is more easily created between nonconducting materials. When a hard rubber rod
is rubbed with fur, the rod will accumulate electrons given up by the fur, as shown in figure 1-5. Since
both materials are poor conductors, very little equalizing current can flow, and an electrostatic charge
builds up. When the charge becomes great enough, current will flow regardless of the poor conductivity
of the materials. These currents will cause visible sparks and produce a crackling sound.
