You set the multimeter to operate as a dc voltmeter by placing the function switch in either of two
positions: +DC or - DC. The meter leads, as in the case of the ohmmeter function, must be connected to
the proper meter jacks. When you measure dc voltages, be sure the red lead is the positive lead and the
black lead is the negative, or common, lead. View A of figure 4-4 is a functional block diagram of dc
voltage circuits in a multimeter. View B shows the jacks and switch positions for measuring dc voltages.
