Every transmission line possesses a certain CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE, usually designated
as Z0. Z0 is the ratio of E to I at every point along the line. If a load equal to the characteristic impedance
is placed at the output end of any length of line, the same impedance will appear at the input terminals of
the line. The characteristic impedance is the only value of impedance for any given type and size of line
that acts in this way. The characteristic impedance determines the amount of current that can flow when a
given voltage is applied to an infinitely long line. Characteristic impedance is comparable to the
resistance that determines the amount of current that flows in a dc circuit.
