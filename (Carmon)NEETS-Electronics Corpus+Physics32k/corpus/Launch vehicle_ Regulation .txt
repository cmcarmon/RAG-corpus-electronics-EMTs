Under international law, the nationality of the owner of a launch vehicle determines which country is responsible for any damages resulting from that vehicle.
In the US, any rocket launch that is not classified as amateur, and also is not "for and by the government," must be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (FAA/AST), located in Washington, DC.
