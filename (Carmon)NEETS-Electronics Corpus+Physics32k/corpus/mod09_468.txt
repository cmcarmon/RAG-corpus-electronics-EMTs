The linearity in this case is good. Using the Universal Time Constant Chart, a 10-percent charge 
amounts to 0.1 time constant. The electrical length is, again, RC times the number of time constants. With 
R1 at 300 kilohms and C1 at .005 microfarads, the time constant is 1,500 microseconds. One-tenth of a 
time constant is equal to 150 microseconds; so the electrical length is 150 microseconds. Prt is the 
electrical length plus the fall or flyback time. If C1 discharges from 5.3 volts to 2 volts in 15 
microseconds, then the prt is 150 + 15, or 165 microseconds. The prf is about 6 kilohertz
