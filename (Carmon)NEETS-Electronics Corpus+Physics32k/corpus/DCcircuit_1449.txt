The simple time constant formula (τ =RC) is based on a simple series resistance connected to
the capacitor. For that matter, the time constant formula for an inductive circuit (τ =L/R) is also
based on the assumption of a simple series resistance. So, what can we do in a situation like
this, where resistors are connected in a series-parallel fashion with the capacitor (or inductor)?
The answer comes from our studies in network analysis. Thevenin’s Theorem tells us that
we can reduce any linear circuit to an equivalent of one voltage source, one series resistance,
and a load component through a couple of simple steps. To apply Thevenin’s Theorem to our
scenario here, we’ll regard the reactive component (in the above example circuit, the capaci-
tor) as the load and remove it temporarily from the circuit to ﬁnd the Thevenin voltage and
Thevenin resistance. Then, once we’ve determined the Thevenin equivalent circuit values,
we’ll re-connect the capacitor and solve for values of voltage or current over time as we’ve been
doing so far.
