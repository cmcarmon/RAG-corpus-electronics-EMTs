A  wide  variety  of  phase  detector  circuits  are  available,  and  the  optimum  type  will  depend  on  the  circuit
requirements. An  analog  multiplier  (or  mixer)  may  be  used  and  is  most  common  in  applications  where  the
comparison frequency must be very high. This type of phase detector produces an output that is the multipli-
cation  of  the  two  input  signals.  If  the  inputs  are  sine  waves,  the  output  will  consist  of  a  double-frequency
component  as  well  as  a  dc  component  that  is  proportional  to  the  cosine  of  the  input  phase  difference.  The
low-pass ﬁlter
double-frequency component can be removed with a 
, leaving only the dc component. The analog
–
multiplier  has  a  somewhat  limited  phase  range  of 
90  degrees.  The  remainder  of  the  phase  detector  types
discussed here are digital in nature and operate using digital edges or transitions of the signals to be compared.
