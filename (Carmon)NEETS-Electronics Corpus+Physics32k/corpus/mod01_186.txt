The first method discovered for creating a voltage was that of generation by friction. The
development of charges by rubbing a rod with fur is a prime example of the way in which a voltage is
generated by friction. Because of the nature of the materials with which this voltage is generated, it
cannot be conveniently used or maintained. For this reason, very little practical use has been found for
voltages generated by this method.
