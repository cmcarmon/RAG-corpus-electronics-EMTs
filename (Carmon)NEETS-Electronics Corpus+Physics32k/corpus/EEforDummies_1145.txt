The most important thing to remember about solderless breadboards is 
that they have internal electrical connections. For instance, the five holes 
in row 10, columns a through e are connected to each other; the five holes 
in row 10, columns f through j are connected to each other. And all the 
holes in each individual power rail (those columns labeled + and –) are 
 connected to each other, but the four power rails are not connected to 
each other.
