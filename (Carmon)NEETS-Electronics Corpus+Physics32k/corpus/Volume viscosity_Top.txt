Volume viscosity (also called second coefficient of viscosity or dilatational viscosity or bulk viscosity) becomes important only for such effects where fluid compressibility is essential. Volume viscosity is mainly related to the vibrational energy of the molecules. It is zero for monatomic gases at low density, but can be large for fluids with larger molecules. The volume viscosity is important in describing sound attenuation in molecular gases, and the absorption of sound energy into the fluid depends on the sound frequency i.e. the rate of fluid compression and expansion. Volume viscosity is also important in describing the fluid dynamics of liquids containing gas bubbles. For an incompressible liquid the volume viscosity is superfluous, and does not appear in the equation of motion.
