These hazardous situations can be caused by a transmitter or antenna installation. These generate 
electromagnetic radiation in the vicinity of personnel, ordnance, or fueling operations in excess of 
established safe levels. Sometimes the existing electromagnetic radiation levels increase to a hazardous 
level. When personnel, ordnance, or fueling evolutions are located in an area that can be illuminated by 
electromagnetic radiation, hazardous situations may occur.
