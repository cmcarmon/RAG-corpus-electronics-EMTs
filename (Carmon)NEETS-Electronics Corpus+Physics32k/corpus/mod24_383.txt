In the strictest sense, a mechanical splice is a permanent connection made between two optical
fibers. Mechanical splices hold the two optical fibers in alignment for an indefinite period of time without
movement. The amount of splice loss is stable over time and unaffected by changes in environmental or
mechanical conditions.
