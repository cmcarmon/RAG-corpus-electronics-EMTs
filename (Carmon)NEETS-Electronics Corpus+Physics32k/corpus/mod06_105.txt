The electrical parameters of a diode, and any tube, are specific. In the process of discussing these
parameters, we will state exact values. Voltages will be increased and decreased and the effects measured.
Limiting factors and quantities will be explored and defined. The discussion will be based on simplified
and experimental circuits.
