In figure 3-32, the impedance (Z) the generator sees for various lengths of line is shown at the top.
The curves above the letters of various heights show the relative value of the impedances presented to the
generator for the various line lengths. The circuit symbols indicate the equivalent electrical circuits for the
transmission lines at each particular length. The standing waves of voltage and current are shown on each
length of line.
