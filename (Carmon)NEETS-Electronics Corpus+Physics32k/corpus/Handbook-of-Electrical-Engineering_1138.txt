Four techniques that have been used for designing optimal equiripple IIR digital ﬁlters are [Parks and Burrus,
1987]  (1)  minimizing  the Lp  norm  of  the  weighted  difference  between  the  desired  and  actual  responses,  (2)
linear programming, (3) iteratively using the Remez exchange algorithm on the numerator and denominator
of the transfer function, and (4) the differential correction algorithm. A computer program for implementing
the ﬁrst method is available in DSP Committee [1979].
