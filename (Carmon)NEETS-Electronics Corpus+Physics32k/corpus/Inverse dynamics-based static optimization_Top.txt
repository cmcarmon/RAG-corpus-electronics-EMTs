Inverse dynamics-based static optimization is a method for estimating muscle-tendon forces from the measured (e.g. through gait analysis) kinematics of a given body part. It exploits the concepts of inverse dynamics and static optimization (in opposition to dynamic programming). Joint moments are obtained by inverse dynamics and then, knowing muscular moment arms, a static optimization process is carried on to evaluate optimal single-muscle forces for the system
