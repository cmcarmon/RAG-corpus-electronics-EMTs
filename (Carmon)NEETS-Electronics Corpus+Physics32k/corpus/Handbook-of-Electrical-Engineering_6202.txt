Although  Class  A  stations  cover  large  areas  at  night,  approximately  in  a  1220-km  (750-mi)  radius,  the
nighttime coverage of Class B, C, and D stations is limited by interference from other stations, electrical devices,
and atmospheric conditions to a relatively small area. Class C stations, for example, have an interference-free
nighttime coverage radius of approximately 8 to 16 km. As a result, there may be large differences in the area
that  the  station  covers  daytime  versus  nighttime. With  over  5200 AM  stations  licensed  for  operation  by  the
FCC, interference, both day and night, is a factor that signiﬁcantly limits the service which stations may provide.
In the absence of interference, a daytime signal strength of 2 mV/m is required for reception in populated areas
of  more  than  2500,  while  a  signal  of  0.5 mV/m  is  generally  acceptable  in  less  populated  areas.  Secondary
nighttime service is provided in areas receiving a 0.5-mV/m signal 50% or more of the time without objec-
tionable interference. Table 69.4 indicates the daytime contour overlap limits. However, it should be noted that
these limits apply to new stations and modiﬁcations to existing stations. Nearly every station on the air was
allocated prior to the implementation of these rules when the interference criteria were less restrictive.
