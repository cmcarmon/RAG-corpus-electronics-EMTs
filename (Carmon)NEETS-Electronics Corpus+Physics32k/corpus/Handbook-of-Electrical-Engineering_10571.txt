Visual Comfort Probability (VCP). Discomfort glare is most often produced by direct glare from luminances
that are excessively bright. Discomfort glare can also be caused by reﬂected glare, which should not be confused
with veiling reﬂections, which cause a reduction in visual performance rather than discomfort. VCP is based
in terms of the percentage of people who will be expected to ﬁnd the given lighting system acceptable when
they are seated in the most undesirable location.
