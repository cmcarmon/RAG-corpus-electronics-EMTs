 1, there is a continuous decrease in current flowing into the
capacitor. The decreasing flow is caused by the voltage buildup across the capacitor. At time t1, current
flowing in the capacitor stops. At this time, the capacitor has reached full charge and has stored maximum
energy in its electrostatic field. Graph (C) represents the voltage drop (e) across the resistor (R). The value
of er  is determined by the amount of current flowing through the resistor on its way to the capacitor. At time
t0 the current flowing to the capacitor is maximum. Thus, the voltage drop across the resistor is maximum (E
= IR). As time progresses toward time t1, the current flowing to the capacitor steadily decreases and causes
the voltage developed across the resistor (R) to steadily decrease.  When time t
