In March 2008, the Government announced in its budget that abuse of double taxation agreements would be addressed, and indicated its intention via Budget Note 66 (or BN66 as it is more commonly referred to). This included the changes to be made to clause 55 of the UK Finance Bill 2008 specifically intended to remove the ability for beneficiaries of foreign trusts to exploit double taxation treaties. At the time of the announcement the Government characterised these changes as "clarification" of the law rather than as retrospective changes.
The proposals in BN66 closed the loophole that made these schemes legal. It did this not only prospectively but was also applied with retrospective effect to the legislation passed in 1987, which was in itself retrospective.
The key difference between this change and that applied to the 1987 legislation is that the earlier changes exempted those who would have otherwise been retrospectively caught by the legislation (specifically Mr Padmore).
In the case of S58 this change was applied without exemption. This meant that many people who had been using tax avoidance schemes in the belief that they were legal in the wake of the Padmore decision and the legislation that followed it, found themselves facing large tax bills due to this retrospective application.
