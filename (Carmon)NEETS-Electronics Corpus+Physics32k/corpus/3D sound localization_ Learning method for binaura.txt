Binaural hearing learning is a bionic method. The sensor is a robot dummy head with 2 sensor microphones along with the artificial pinna (reflector). The robot head has 2 rotation axes and can rotate horizontally and vertically. The reflector causes the spectrum change into a certain pattern for incoming white noise sound wave and this pattern is used for the cue of the vertical localization. The cue for horizontal localization is ITD. The system makes use of a learning process using neural networks by rotating the head with a settled white noise sound source and analyzing the spectrum. Experiments show that the system can identify the direction of the source well in a certain range of angle of arrival. It cannot identify the sound coming outside the range due to the collapsed spectrum pattern of the reflector. Binaural hearing use only 2 microphones and is capable of concentrating on one source among multiple sources of noises.
