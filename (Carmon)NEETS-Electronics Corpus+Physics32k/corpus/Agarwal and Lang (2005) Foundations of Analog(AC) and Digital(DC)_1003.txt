We are often interested in amplifying time-varying signals. Because the amplifier
turns off for input voltages less than VT, it is important to add an appropriate
DC offset voltage to the time-varying input signal so that the amplifier remains
in the saturation region for the entire range of input voltage variation. This
input DC offset voltage defines the operating point of the amplifier. The DC
offset must be chosen carefully, for if it is too large, the amplifier will be pushed
into the triode region, and if it is too low, the amplifier will slide into the cutoff
region. How do we choose this operating point?
