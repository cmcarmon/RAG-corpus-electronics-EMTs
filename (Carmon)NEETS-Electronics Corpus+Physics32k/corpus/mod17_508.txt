Spin stabilization operates on the principle that direction of the spin axis of a rotating body tends to 
remain fixed in space. An example of spin stabilization is the effect of the rotation of the earth in keeping 
its axis fixed in space. A satellite that has a spin axis parallel to the axis of the earth will maintain this 
position since both axes are fixed in space. Figure 4-8 illustrates the use of this principle. It depicts an 
equatorial orbit satellite used to keep a doughnut-shaped antenna pattern pointing toward the earth.
