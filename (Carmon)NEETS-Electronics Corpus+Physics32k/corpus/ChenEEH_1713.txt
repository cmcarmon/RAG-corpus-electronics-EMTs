features and high-level semantics often called the semantic
gap. This effort has to take into account the information
from audio as well as from video sources. Naphade et al.
(1998b) have proposed the concept of Multiject, a multimedia
object. A Multiject is the high-level representation of a certain
object, event, or site having features from audio as well as from
video. It has a semantic label, that describes the object in
words. It also has associated multimodal features (including
both audio and video features) that represent its physical
appearance. Multiject also has an associated probability of
occurrence in conjunction with other objects in the same
domain (shot). Experiments using Multiject concepts from
three main categories of objects (e.g., airplane), sites (e.g.,
indoor), and events (e.g., gunshot) have been conducted.
Given the multimodal feature vector ~XXj of the jth frame and
assuming uniform priors on the presence or absence of any
concept
the probability of occurrence of
each concept in the jth frame is obtained from Bayesâ€™ rule as:
