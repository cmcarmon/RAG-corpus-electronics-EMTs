Disk Rotation Speed
When a disk rotates at a constant angular velocity w, a track
of radius r moves with the constant linear velocity V = rw .
Ideally, one would like to have the same linear velocity for
all  the  tracks,  but  this  is  impractical  except  in  a  limited
number of situations. For instance, when the desired mode
of access to the various tracks is sequential, such as in audio
and video disk applications, it is possible to place the head
in the beginning at the inner radius and move outward from
the  center  thereafter  while  continuously  decreasing  the
angular velocity. By keeping the product of r and w constant,
one  can  thus  achieve  constant  linear  velocity  for  all  the
tracks.1  Sequential  access  mode,  however,  is  the  exception
rather than the norm in data storage systems. In most appli-
cations, the tracks are accessed randomly with such rapidity
that it becomes impossible to adjust the rotation speed for
constant  linear  velocity.  Under  these  circumstances,  the
angular  velocity  is  best  kept  constant  during  the  normal
operation of the disk. Typical rotation speeds are 1200 and
1800 rpm for slower drives and 3600 rpm for the high data
rate systems. Higher rotation rates (5000 rpm and beyond)
are certainly feasible and will likely appear in future storage
devices.
