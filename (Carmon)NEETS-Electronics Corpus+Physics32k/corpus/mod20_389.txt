OHM'S LAWÂ—The current in an electrical circuit is directly proportional to the electromotive force in the 
circuit. The most common form of the law is E = IR, where E is the electromotive force or voltage 
across the circuit, I is the current flowing in the circuit, and R is the resistance of the circuit [1].
