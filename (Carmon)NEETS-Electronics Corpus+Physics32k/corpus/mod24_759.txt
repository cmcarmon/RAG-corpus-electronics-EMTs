Fiber optic receivers can be classified into two categories: digital and analog. Digital receivers
detect the input optical signal, amplify the digital photocurrent, and reshape the signal to produce an
undistorted output electrical signal. Analog receivers detect the input optical signal and amplify the
generated photocurrent.
