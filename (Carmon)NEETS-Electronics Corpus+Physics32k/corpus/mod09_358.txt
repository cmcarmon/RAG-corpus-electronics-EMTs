The SAWTOOTH waveform is shown in figure 3-1, view (D). A sawtooth wave resembles the teeth 
of a saw blade. There is a rapid vertical rise of voltage from T0 to T1, which is linear (straight). At T1 this 
voltage abruptly falls (essentially no time used) to its previous static value. The voltage remains at this 
value until T2 when it again has a linear rise. You can see this action in an oscilloscope where there are 
two voltage input locations, vertical and horizontal. If you apply a linear voltage to the vertical input, the 
electron beam will be forced to move in a vertical direction on the crt. A linear voltage applied to the 
horizontal input will cause the electron beam to move horizontally across the crt. The application of two 
linear voltages, one to the vertical input and one to the horizontal input at the same time, will cause the
