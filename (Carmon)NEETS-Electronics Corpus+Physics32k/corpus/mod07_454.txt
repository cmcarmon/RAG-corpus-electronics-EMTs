Now look at figure 4-22 which illustrates a complete cycle of operation for a full-wave rectifier 
circuit used to supply the input voltage to the filter. The rectifier voltage is developed across the capacitor 
(C1). The ripple voltage at the output of the filter is the alternating component of the input voltage 
reduced in amplitude by the filter section. Each time the anode of a diode goes positive with respect to the 
cathode, the diode conducts and C1 charges. Conduction occurs twice during each cycle for a full-wave 
rectifier. For a 60-hertz supply, this produces a 120-hertz ripple voltage. Although the diodes alternate 
(one conducts while the other is nonconducting), the filter input voltage is not steady. As the anode 
voltage of the conducting diode increases (on the positive half of the cycle), capacitor C1 charges-the 
charge being limited by the impedance of the secondary transformer winding, the diode's forward 
(cathode-to-anode) resistance, and the counter electromotive force developed by the choke. During the 
nonconducting interval (when the anode voltage drops below the capacitor charge voltage), C1 discharges 
through the load resistor (RL). The components in the discharge path have a long time constant; thus, C1 
discharges more slowly than it charges.
