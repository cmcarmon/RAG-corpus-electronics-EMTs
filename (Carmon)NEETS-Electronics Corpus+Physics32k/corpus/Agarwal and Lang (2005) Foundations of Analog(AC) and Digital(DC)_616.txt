h y p o t h e t i c a l n o n l i n e a r d e v i c e Figure 4.25a shows a circuit
containing some hypothetical nonlinear device whose v i characteristics are approxi-
mated using the piecewise-linear graph shown in Figure 4.25b. The nonlinear device
with its terminal voltage and current defined as shown in Figure 4.26a might have an
actual v i curve as illustrated in Figure 4.26b. Figure 4.26c shows the correspondence
between the deviceâ€™s actual v i curve and the piecewise linear model.
