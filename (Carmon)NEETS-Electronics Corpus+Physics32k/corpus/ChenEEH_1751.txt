important implications for transmission over the communi-
cation networks (Kisner, 2002). When such an image is re-
ceived and decompressed, the receiver can display the image in
a low-quality format and then improve the display as subse-
quent image information is received and decompressed. A user
watching the image display on the screen can recognize most of
the image features after only 5 to 10% of the information has
been decompressed. Progressive compression can be achieved
by: (1) encoding spatial frequency data progressively, (2) using
vector quantization that starts with a gray image and later adds
colors to it, and (3) using pyramid coding that encodes images
into layers, in which early layers are low resolution and later
layers progressively increase the resolution.
