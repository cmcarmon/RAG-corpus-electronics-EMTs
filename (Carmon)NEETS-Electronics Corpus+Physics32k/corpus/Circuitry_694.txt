Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To 
waveforms in a simple audio amplifier. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard, 17 V d.c. power supply (with a current 
limited  output  of  up  to  at  least  500  mA),  BC141, 
BD131 and BD132 transistors (the latter to be fitted 
fixed 
with  small  heatsinks),  1N4148  diode, 
resistors  of  1  G
,
10 kG
, 5% 0.25 W, capacitors 
of 10 µF, 220 µF, 1,000 µF and 4,700 µF at 25 V 
d.c.,  oscilloscope,  digital  multimeter,  AF  signal 
generator with sine wave output at 1 kHz, test leads 
and probes. 
 
Procedure 
 
Connect  the  circuit  as  shown  in  Fig.  14.35.  With 
the signal generator disconnected, connect the d.c. 
supply and use the digital multimeter on the 20 V
