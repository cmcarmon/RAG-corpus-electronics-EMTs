We want to concentrate on systems that are both linear and shift-invariant. It will be these that allow us
the full power of frequency-domain analysis and implementations. Because we have no physical constraints
in “constructing” such systems, we need only a mathematical speciﬁcation. In analog systems, the diﬀeren-
tial equation speciﬁes the input-output relationship in the time-domain. The corresponding discrete-time
speciﬁcation is the diﬀerence equation.
