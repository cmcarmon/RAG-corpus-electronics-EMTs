These meters are generally used at 60-hertz ac, but may be used at other ac frequencies. By changing
the meter scale to indicate dc values rather than ac rms values, moving-vane meters will measure dc
current and dc voltage. This is not recommended due to the residual magnetism left in the vanes, which
will result in an error in the instrument.
