An AM receiver processes amplitude-modulated signals received by its antenna. It delivers an output
that is a reproduction of the signal that originally modulated the rf carrier at the transmitter. The signal
can then be applied to some reproducing device, such as a loudspeaker, or to a terminal device, such as a
teletypewriter. Actual AM receivers vary widely in complexity. Some are very simple; others contain a
large number of complex circuits.
