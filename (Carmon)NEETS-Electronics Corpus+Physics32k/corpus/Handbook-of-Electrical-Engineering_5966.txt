Stepping Motors
These motors convert a series of power pulses to a corresponding series of equal angular movements. These
pulses can be delivered at a variable rate, allowing the accurate positioning of the rotor without feedback. They
can develop torque up to 15 Nm and can handle 1500 to 2500 pulses per second. They have zero steady state
error in positioning and high torque density. An important characteristic of stepping motors is that when one
phase is activated they do not develop a rotating but rather a holding torque, which makes them retain accurately
their position, even under load.
