Micromachined devices with moving parts are at the heart
of most of the MEMS sensors already prototyped, many of
which are in production. Basically, some condition, be it phys-
ical, chemical, or biological, induces motion in the MEMS
device that can be sensed by any of several mechanisms. For
example, resistive or capacitive sensing of the deï¬‚ection of a
thin, small membrane is used in various MEMS to measure
pressure and ultrasound levels. The most important MEMS
sensors detect pressure and acceleration; devices for measure-
ment of angular rates are now moving to large-scale produc-
tion, largely for automotive applications.
