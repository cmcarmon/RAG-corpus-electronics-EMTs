To  obtain  the  third  required  equation,  we  form  what  is  called  a
supernode, indicated by the dotted enclosure in the network. Just as KCL must be satisﬁed at any node in the
network, it must be satisﬁed at the supernode as well. Therefore, summing all the currents leaving the supernode
yields the equation
