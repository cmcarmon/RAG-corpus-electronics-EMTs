Another criteria that is often used to determine internal stabil-
ity of the feedback interconnection is the small gain theorem,
which is based on limiting the loop gain of the system. This
theorem is central to the analysis of robust stability. The small
gain theorem states that if the feedback interconnection of
two proper and stable systems has a loop-gain product less
than unity, then the closed-loop system is internally stable.
There exist several versions of this theorem. One version is
given next.
