In astrophysics, Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem addresses the question under what conditions one can have an ellipsoidal configuration at all times of a homogeneous rotating fluid mass and in which the motion, in an inertial frame is a linear function of the coordinates, named after Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. Dirichlet's basic idea was to reduce Euler equations to system of ordinary differential equations such that the position of a fluid particle in a homogeneous ellipsoid at any time is a linear and homogeneous function of initial position of the fluid particle, using Lagrangian framework instead of the Eulerian framework.
