Crystals of this type also possess another interesting property, the "converse piezoelectric effect."
That is, they have the ability to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. A voltage impressed
across the proper surfaces of the crystal will cause it to expand or contract its surfaces in response to the
voltage applied.
