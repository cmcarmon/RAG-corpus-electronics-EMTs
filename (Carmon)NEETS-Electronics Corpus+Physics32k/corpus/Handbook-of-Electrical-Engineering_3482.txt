In chip packages that provide for lateral spreading of the heat generated in the chips, the increasing cross-
sectional area for heat ﬂow at successive layers reduces the internal thermal resistance. Unfortunately, however,
there is an additional resistance associated with the lateral ﬂow of the heat, which must be taken into account
in determining the chip-to-case temperature difference.
