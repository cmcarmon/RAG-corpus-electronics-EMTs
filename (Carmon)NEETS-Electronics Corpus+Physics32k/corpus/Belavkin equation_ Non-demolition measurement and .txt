Noncommutativity presents a major challenge for probabilistic interpretation of quantum stochastic differential equations due to non-existence of conditional expectations for general pairs of quantum observables. Belavkin resolved this issue by discovering the error-perturbation uncertainty relation and formulating the non-demolition principle of quantum measurement. In particular, if the stochastic process



d
y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle dy(t)}
corresponds to the error



e
(
t
)
d
t
=
d
w


{\displaystyle e(t)dt=dw}
(white noise in the diffusive case) of a noisy observation



Y
(
t
)
=
X
(
t
)
+
e
(
t
)


{\displaystyle Y(t)=X(t)+e(t)}
of operator



X
(
t
)
=
λ
[
L
(
t
)
+

L

∗


(
t
)
]


{\displaystyle X(t)=\lambda [L(t)+L^{\ast }(t)]}
with the accuracy coefficient



λ
>
0


{\displaystyle \lambda >0}
, then the indirect observation perturbs the dynamics of the system by a stochastic force



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}
, called the Langevin force, which is another white noise of intensity



(
ℏ
λ

)

2




{\displaystyle (\hbar \lambda )^{2}}
that does not commute with the error



e
(
t
)


{\displaystyle e(t)}
. The result of such a perturbation is that the output process



Y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle Y(t)}
is commutative



[
Y
(
s
)
,
Y
(
t
)
]
=
0


{\displaystyle [Y(s),Y(t)]=0}
, and hence




∫

0


t


Y
(
r
)
d
r


{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{t}Y(r)dr}
corresponds to a classical observation, while the system operators



X


{\displaystyle X}
satisfy the non-demolition condition: all future observables must commute with the past observations (but not with the future observations):



[
X
(
s
)
,
Y
(
t
)
]
=
0


{\displaystyle [X(s),Y(t)]=0}
for all



s
≥
t


{\displaystyle s\geq t}
(but not



s
<
t


{\displaystyle s<t}
). Note that commutation of



X
(
s
)


{\displaystyle X(s)}
with



Y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle Y(t)}
and another operator



Z
(
s
)


{\displaystyle Z(s)}
with



Y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle Y(t)}
does not imply cummutation of



X
(
s
)


{\displaystyle X(s)}
with



Z
(
s
)


{\displaystyle Z(s)}
, so that the algebra of future observables is still non-commutative. The non-demolition condition is necessary and sufficient for the existence of conditional expectations




E

{
X
(
s
)
∣
Y
(
t
)
}


{\displaystyle \mathbb {E} \{X(s)\mid Y(t)\}}
, which makes the quantum filtering possible.
