A  generic  videoconference  system  is  presented  in  Fig  102.10.  The  system  consists  of  a  specially  designed
room,  video/audio  equipment,  transmission  equipment,  monitor  and  control  computer,  and  space  segment.
The video and audio feeds from the meeting room pass through the codec and are compressed. From the codec,
the signal passes to the satellite modem for modulation. The radio frequency/terminal (RFT) upconverts the
modulated carrier and ampliÔ¨Åes it for transmission to the satellite. At the other site, the process is reversed.
