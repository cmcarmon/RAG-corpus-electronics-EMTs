A digital signal can be processed independently of whether it
represents a discrete data source or a digitized analog source.
This implies that an essentially unlimited range of signal con-
ditioning and processing options is available to the designer.
Depending on the origination and destination of the infor-
mation being conveyed, it may include source coding, encryp-
tion, pulse shaping for spectral control, forward error correction
(FEC) coding, special modulation to spread the signal spectrum,
and equalization to compensate for channel distortion.
