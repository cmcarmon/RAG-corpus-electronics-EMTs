The swept-frequency response of a filter or amplifier and the swept-distortion measurement of a 
tuned oscillator are also measurable with the aid of a spectrum analyzer. However, in the course of these 
measurements, a variable persistence display or an X-Y recorder should be used to simplify readability. 
Examples of tuned-oscillator harmonics and filter response are illustrated in figure 5-11. Frequency-
conversion devices such as mixers and harmonic generators are easily characterized by such parameters 
as conversion loss, isolation, and distortion. These parameters can be displayed, as shown in figure 5-12, 
with the aid of a spectrum analyzer.
