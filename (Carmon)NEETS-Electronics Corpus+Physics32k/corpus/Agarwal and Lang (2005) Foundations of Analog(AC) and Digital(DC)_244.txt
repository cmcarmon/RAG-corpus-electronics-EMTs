p r o b l e m 1.1 Determine the resistance of a cube with sides of length l cms and
resistivity 10 -cm, when a pair of opposite surfaces are chosen as the terminals.
p r o b l e m 1.2
internal resistance of 10 Ohms.
p r o b l e m 1.3 A battery rated at 7.2 V and 10000 J is connected across a light-
bulb. Assume that the internal resistance of the battery is zero. Further assume that the
resistance of the lightbulb is 100 .
