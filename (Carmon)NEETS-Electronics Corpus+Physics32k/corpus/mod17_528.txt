The constants defining an orbit are initially obtained by the process of tracking. At the time of 
launch, the rocket is tracked by radar from lift-off to orbit and then until it passes out of sight. Tracking 
data obtained in this way is sufficient for making rough predictions of the orbit. These predictions are 
made rapidly with a computer and sent to tracking stations all over the world. These other tracking 
stations watch for the satellite during its first trip and record additional data. During the first week of 
orbiting, tracking stations all around the world are obtaining progressively more accurate data concerning 
the Satellite. This data is put into a computer where corrections of earlier estimates of the orbit are made.
