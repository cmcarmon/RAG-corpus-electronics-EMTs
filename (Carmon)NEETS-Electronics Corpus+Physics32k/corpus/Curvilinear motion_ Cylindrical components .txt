With cylindrical co-ordinates which are described as Ã® and j, the motion is best described in polar form with components that resemble polar vectors. As with planar motion, the velocity is always tangential to the curve, but in this form acceleration consist of different intermediate components that can now run along the radius and its normal vector. This type of co-ordinate system is best used when the motion is restricted to the plane upon which it travels.
