Considering the energy conservation of the simple reaction, enables the general definition of Q based on mass-energy equivalence, where K is kinetic energy and m is mass:




Q
=

K

f


−

K

i


=
(

m

i


−

m

f


)

c

2




{\displaystyle Q=K_{\text{f}}-K_{\text{i}}=(m_{\text{i}}-m_{\text{f}})c^{2}}

A reaction with a positive Q value is exothermic, i.e. has a net release of energy, since the kinetic energy of the final state is greater than the kinetic energy of the initial state. A reaction with a negative Q value is endothermic, i.e. requires a net energy input, since the kinetic energy of the final state is less than the kinetic energy of the initial state. Observe that a chemical reaction is exothermic when it has a negative enthalpy of reaction, in contrast a positive Q value in a nuclear reaction.
The Q value can also be expressed in terms of the binding energies of the nuclear species as:




Q
=

B

f


−

B

i




{\displaystyle Q=B_{f}-B_{i}}

Proof: Note that the count of nucleons is conserved in a nuclear reaction. Hence, total reactant protons = total product protons and total reactant neutrons = total product neutrons. Hence, the sum of binding energy and rest mass energy of nuclei of both reactant and products are same. In other words,




B

f

{\displaystyle B_{i}+m_{i}c^{2}=B_{f}+m_{f}c^{2}}
. Using the first relation (



Q

)

c

{\displaystyle Q=(m_{\text{i}}-m_{\text{f}})c^{2}}
), this proof is complete.
