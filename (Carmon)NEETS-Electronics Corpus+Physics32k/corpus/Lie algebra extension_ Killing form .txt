The Killing form is a symmetric bilinear form on g defined by

{\displaystyle K(G_{1},G_{2})=\mathrm {trace} (\mathrm {ad} _{G_{1}}\mathrm {ad} _{G_{2}}).}

Here adG is viewed as a matrix operating on the vector space g. The key fact needed is that if g is semisimple, then, by Cartan's criterion, K is non-degenerate. In such a case K may be used to identify g and g∗. If λ ∈ g∗, then there is a ν(λ) = Gλ ∈ g such that

∀

{\displaystyle \langle \lambda ,G\rangle =K(G_{\lambda },G)\quad \forall G\in {\mathfrak {g}}.}

This is resembling Riesz representation theorem and the proof is virtually the same. The Killing form has the property

{\displaystyle K([G_{1},G_{2}],G_{3})=K(G_{1},[G_{2},G_{3}]),}

which is referred to as associativity. By defining gαβ = K[Gα,Gβ] and expanding the inner brackets in terms of structure constants, one finds that the Killing form satisfies the invariance condition of above.
