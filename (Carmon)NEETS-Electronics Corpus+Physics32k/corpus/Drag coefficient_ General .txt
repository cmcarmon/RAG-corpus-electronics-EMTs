In general,




c


d






{\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {d} }\,}
is not an absolute constant for a given body shape. It varies with the speed of airflow (or more generally with Reynolds number



R
e


{\displaystyle Re}
). A smooth sphere, for example, has a




c


d






{\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {d} }\,}
that varies from high values for laminar flow to 0.47 for turbulent flow. Although the drag coefficient decreases with increasing



R
e


{\displaystyle Re}
, the drag force increases.
