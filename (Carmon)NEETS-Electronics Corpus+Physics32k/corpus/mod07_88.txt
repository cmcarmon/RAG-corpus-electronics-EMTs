The concept of energy bands is particularly important in classifying materials as conductors,
semiconductors, and insulators. An electron can exist in either of two energy bands, the conduction band
or the valence band. All that is necessary to move an electron from the valence band to the conduction
band so it can be used for electric current, is enough energy to carry the electron through the forbidden
band. The width of the forbidden band or the separation between the conduction and valence bands
determines whether a substance is an insulator, semiconductor, or conductor. Figure 1-6 uses energy level
diagrams to show the difference between insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.
