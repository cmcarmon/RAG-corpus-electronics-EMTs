If the internal resistance of the voltmeter is approximately the same value as the resistance being
tested, it will indicate a considerably lower voltage than the actual voltage present when the meter is
removed from the circuit. The sensitivity (in ohms per volt) of the voltmeter used to prepare the voltage
charts is provided on those charts. If a meter of similar sensitivity is available, you should use it to reduce
the effects of loading.
