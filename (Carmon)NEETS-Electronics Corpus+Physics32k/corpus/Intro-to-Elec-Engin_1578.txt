15.3.18 Four voice messages, each with 3-kHz bandwidth,
are to be sampled at Nyquist rate, and time-
multiplexed with samples taken at
twice the
Nyquist rate from six analog monitoring signals,
each with 0.5-kHz bandwidth. Determine the du-
ration of the frame and suggest a sampling scheme
indicating the timing of samples.
