For converting from decimal to octal form, one follows the same procedure as for conversion
from decimal to binary; but instead of dividing by 2 for the integer part, one divides by 8
to obtain the octal equivalent. Also, instead of multiplying by 2 for the fractional part, one
multiplies by 8 to obtain the fractional octal equivalent of the decimal fraction. However, it
is more common to convert from binary to octal and vice versa. Binary to octal conversion
is accomplished by grouping the binary number into groups of 3 bits each, starting from
the binary point and proceeding to the right as well as to the left; each group is then re-
placed by its octal equivalent. For example, (100101111011.01011)2 is arranged as 100 101
111 011 . 010 110↑ (note that a trailing 0 is added to complete the last group in the fractional
part). Replacing each group by its octal “decimal” equivalent, one obtains (4573.26)8. The
conversion from octal to binary is done by replacing each octal digit with its 3-bit binary
equivalent.
The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system which has 16 distinct symbols in the
set: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}, where A is equivalent to 10, B to 11, , and F to 15.
A hexadecimal number is therefore expressed as a string of any combination of the 16 symbols.
To convert from hexadecimal to decimal, for example,
(2AB)16 = 2 × 162 + A × 161 + B × 160 = 2 × 162 + 10 × 161 + 11 × 160 = (683)10
(.F8)16 = F × 16
