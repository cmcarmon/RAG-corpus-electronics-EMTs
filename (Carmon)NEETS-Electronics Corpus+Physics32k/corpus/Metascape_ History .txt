At the "OMICs" age it is important to gain biological insights into a list of genes. Although a number of bioinformatics sources exist for this purpose, such as DAVID, they are not all free, easy to use, and well maintained. To analyze multiple lists of genes originated from orthogonal but complementary "OMICs" studies, tools often require computational skills that are beyond the reach of many biologists. A team of scientists self-organized to create and released Metascape on Oct 8, 2015. Metascape has gone through multiple releases since then. The latest release 3.0 supports key model organisms, pathway enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network and component analysis, automatic presentation of the results as publication-ready web report, Excel and PowerPoint presentations. The first Metascape application was published on Dec 9, 2015.
