Ampliﬁers in the IF circuits provide most of the gain needed to raise the small antenna
signal to a level sufﬁcient to drive the envelope detector. The output of the detector contains a
dc component proportional to Ac and a component proportional to the audio message f (t), the
ampliﬁed signal of which is used to drive the loudspeaker. The dc component is utilized in an
automatic volume control (AVC), otherwise known as automatic gain control (AGC), loop to
control the gain of RF and IF ampliﬁers by controlling their operating bias points. The loop action
is to maintain nearly a constant IF level at the detector’s input, even for large variations in antenna
voltage.
