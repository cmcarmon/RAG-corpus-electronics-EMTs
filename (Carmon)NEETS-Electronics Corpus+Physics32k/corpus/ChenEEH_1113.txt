The long-term reliability of MEMS components is essential to
their utility for consumer, industrial, and military applications,
no matter whether they are used continuously or intermit-
tently. Reliability can be either an enabler for applications or
else a ‘‘show stopper.’’ Hence, there have been questions and
concerns about the reliability of MEMS devices from about
1980 when they ﬁrst appeared on the market. A great deal of
work has been done to determine the ability of MEMS to
operate for long times and in diverse environments. This
section is a summary of some of the highlights of that work.
A few references on MEMS reliability include Miller et al.
(1998), Stark (1999), Lawton (2000), and the www.sandia.gov/
