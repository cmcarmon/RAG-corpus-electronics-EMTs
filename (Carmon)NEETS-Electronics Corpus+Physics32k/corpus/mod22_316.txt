The instruction is the fundamental element in program preparation. Like a sentence, an instruction 
consists of a subject and a predicate. However, the subject is usually not specifically mentioned; rather it 
is some implied part of the computer system directed to execute the command that is given. For example, 
the chief tells a sailor to "dump the trash." The sailor will interpret this instruction correctly even though 
the subject "you" is omitted. Similarly, if the computer is told to " ADD 1234," the control section may 
interpret this to mean that the arithmetic-logic section is to add the contents of address 1234 to the 
contents of the accumulator (a register in which the result of an operation is formed).
