Holes are spaced 1/10 of an inch apart (0.1 inch), a size just right for DIP ICs, 
most transistors, and discrete components, such as capacitors and resistors. 
You just plug DIP ICs, resistors, capacitors, transistors, and 20‐ or 22‐gauge 
solid wire into the proper contact holes to create your circuit. Typically, you 
use the two center sections of the board to make connections between com-
ponents; use the left and right sections of the board to connect power.
