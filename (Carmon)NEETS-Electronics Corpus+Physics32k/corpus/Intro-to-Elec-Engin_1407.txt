where λ is the wavelength being transmitted (or received), and Ae is the effective aperture or
effective area of the antenna. Power ampliﬁers are needed to overcome the radio-transmission
loss just as in a transmission-line system. Similar considerations hold for optical radiation, in
which the electromagnetic wave takes the form of a coherent light beam.
