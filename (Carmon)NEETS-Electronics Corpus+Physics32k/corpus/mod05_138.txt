AMPLIDYNES are dc generators that are designed to act as high-gain amplifiers. By short-
circuiting the brushes in a normal dc generator and adding another set of brushes perpendicular to the 
original ones, an amplidyne is formed. Its power output may be up to 10,000 times larger than the power 
input to its control windings.
