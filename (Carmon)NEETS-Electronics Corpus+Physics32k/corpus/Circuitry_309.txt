Voltage regulators 
 
A simple voltage regulator is shown in Fig. 6.19. RS
is included to limit the zener current to a safe value 
when the load is disconnected. When a load (RL) is 
connected, the zener current (IZ) will fall as current 
is  diverted  into  the  load  resistance  (it  is  usual  to 
allow a minimum current of 2 mA to 5 mA in order 
to  ensure  that  the  diode  regulates).  The  output 
voltage (VZ) will remain at the zener  voltage until 
regulation  fails  at  the  point  at  which  the  potential 
divider  formed  by  RS and  RL produces  a  lower 
output voltage that is less than VZ. The ratio of RS
to  RL is  thus  important.  At  the  point  at  which  the 
circuit just begins to fail to regulate:
