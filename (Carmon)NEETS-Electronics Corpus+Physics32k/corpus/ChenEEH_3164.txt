Voltage surges produced by lightning and/or switching op-
erations are a major factor to be considered in the electrical
design of the insulator. Insulators should be designed so that
they do not fail at surge voltage magnitudes that are lower than
the value for which the power system apparatus has been
designed. For higher magnitude surges, the insulator should
be a ﬂashover. The determining values of these surges are
deﬁned by the basic lightning impulse insulation level
(BIL) and basic switching impulse insulation level (BSL).
