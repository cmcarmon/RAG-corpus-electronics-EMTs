At very low strain, the molecular mechanism for elasticity arises from the distortion, or stretching, of kinks along the chain contour. Physically, the applied strain causes the kinks to be forced beyond from their thermal equilibrium end-to-end distances. A force constant for this regime can be estimated by sampling molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of short chains. From these MD trajectories, the probability distributions of end-to-end distance for short kinks, composed of 2-4 isoprene units, can be obtained. Since these distributions (which turns out to be approximately Gaussian) are directly related to the number of states at each distance, we may associate them with an entropy change of the kink. By numerically differentiating the probability distribution, the change in entropy, and hence free energy, with respect to the kink end-to-end distance can be found. The force model for this regime is linear and proportional to the temperature divided by the chain tortuosity (the ratio of the chain contour length divided by its end-to-end distance).
