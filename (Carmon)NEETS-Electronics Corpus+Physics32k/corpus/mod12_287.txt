The output of a reactance-tube modulated oscillator also contains some unwanted amplitude
modulation. This unwanted modulation is caused by stray capacitance and the resistive component of the
RC phase splitter. The resistance is much less significant than the desired XC, but the resistance does
allow some plate current to flow which is not of the proper phase relationship for good tube operation.
The small amplitude modulation that this produces is easily removed by passing the oscillator output
through a limiter-amplifier circuit.
