NOTE: Effective voltage is the equivalent level of dc voltage, which will cause the same average 
current through a given resistance. By using additional armature coils, the voltage across the brushes is 
not allowed to fall to as low a level between peaks. Compare the graphs in figure 1-4 and 1-5. Notice that 
the ripple has been reduced. Practical generators use many armature coils. They also use more than one 
pair of magnetic poles. The additional magnetic poles have the same effect on ripple as did the additional 
armature coils. In addition, the increased number of poles provides a stronger magnetic field (greater 
number of flux lines). This, in turn, allows an increase in output voltage because the coils cut more lines 
of flux per revolution.
