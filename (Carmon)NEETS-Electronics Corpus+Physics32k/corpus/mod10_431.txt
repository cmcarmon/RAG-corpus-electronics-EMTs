The flux density at the center is so great that electron movement at this point is reduced. As frequency is
increased, the opposition to the flow of current in the center of the wire increases. Current in the center of
the wire becomes smaller and most of the electron flow is on the wire surface. When the frequency
applied is 100 megahertz or higher, the electron movement in the center is so small that the center of the
wire could be removed without any noticeable effect on current. You should be able to see that the
effective cross-sectional area decreases as the frequency increases. Since resistance is inversely
proportional to the cross-sectional area, the resistance will increase as the frequency is increased. Also,
since power loss increases as resistance increases, power losses increase with an increase in frequency
because of skin effect.
