A finite projective plane of order n is a collection of n^2 +n + 1 sets (called "lines") over n^2 + n + 1 elements (called "points"). Each line contains exactly n + 1 points. Each line intersects every other line in exactly one point. The VC dimension of a finite projective plane is 2.
Proof: (a) For each pair of distinct points, there is one line that contains both of them, lines that contain only one of them, and lines that contain none of them, so every set of size 2 is shattered. (b) For any triple of three distinct points, if there is a line x that contain all three, then there is no line y that contains exactly two (since then x and y would intersect in two points, which is contrary to the definition of a projective plane). Hence, no set of size 3 is shattered.
