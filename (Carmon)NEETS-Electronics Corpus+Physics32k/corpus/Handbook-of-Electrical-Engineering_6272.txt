Color-Signal Decoding
Each of the two chroma signal carriers can be recovered individually by means of synchronous detection. A
reference subcarrier of the same phase as the desired chroma signal is applied as a gate to a balanced demod-
ulator. Only the modulation of the signal in the same phase as the reference will be present in the output. A
