Most of the important terms that pertain to the behavior of waves, such as reflection, refraction,
diffraction, etc., were discussed earlier in this chapter. We will now discuss how these terms are used in
understanding light and light waves. The relationship between light and light waves (rays) is the same as
sound and sound waves.
