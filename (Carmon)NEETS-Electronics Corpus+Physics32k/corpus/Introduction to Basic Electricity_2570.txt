Effective values are used in most measurements. 
As stated previously, the effective value is the amount 
of AC voltage that produces the same degree of heat 
as a DC voltage of the same value. The effective value 
can be considered the DC equivalent value. Ohmâ€™s law 
can be used with effective AC values, just as with DC 
 values, in a pure resistive circuit.
eXaMPLe:	 If a circuit has an AC voltage source of 
120 volts and a resistance of 1000 ohms, what is the 
effective current in the circuit? (Remember, an AC
