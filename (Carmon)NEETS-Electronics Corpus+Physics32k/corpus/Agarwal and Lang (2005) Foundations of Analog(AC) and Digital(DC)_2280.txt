p r o b l e m 16.5 Determine vOUT for the circuit shown in Figure 16.37 given
that vIN is a 100-kHz square wave that switches between 0 V and 5 V. The buffer in
the circuit produces an output of 0 V for an input of 2.5 V and below; it produces an
output of 5 V for an input above 2.5 V. Assume that the diode is ideal.

The circuit shown in Figure 16.38 is a very simple power supply
for a resistive load. With a sufficiently large value for C, it produces a reasonably constant
vOUT from a 60-Hz input of the form vIN = 10 V cos(2π 60 rad/s t).
a) Also shown in Figure 16.38 is a graph of vIN and vOUT. Assume that C = 103 µF.
Determine T1 and T2, the times at which vOUT breaks away from and returns to
