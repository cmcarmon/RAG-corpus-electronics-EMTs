Depending on where the output is taken, the series and parallel RLC resonant
circuits can be used as highly selective filters of various types. The higher the
Q, the higher the selectivity. Here, we revisit the series resonance circuit (see
Figure 14.32a) and demonstrate how various types of filters can be derived from
the same basic circuit.
