The modulating signal in view (B) consists of a bit stream of ZEROS and ONES. A ZERO does not
affect the carrier frequency which is usually set to equal the bit rate. For example, a data stream of 1,200
bits per second would have a carrier of 1,200 hertz. When a data bit ONE occurs, the phase of the carrier
frequency is shifted 180 degrees. In view (C) we find that the third, fifth, and sixth cycles (all ONE) have
been reversed in phase. This phase reversal produces CUSPS (sharp phase reversals) which are usually
