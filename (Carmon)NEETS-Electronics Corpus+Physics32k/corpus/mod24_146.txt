where n1 and n2 are the index of refraction for the core and the cladding, respectively. When the
propagation constant becomes smaller than 2 p n2/Ã¿, power leaks out of the core and into the cladding.
Generally, modes leaked into the cladding are lost in a few centimeters. However, leaky modes can carry
a large amount of power in short fibers.
