Multifiber connectors join and align multifiber cables to reduce the time it takes to connect multiple
fibers. One type of multifiber connector is the array connector. The array connector is used to connect
individual ribbons of ribbon-type cables. The array connector is similar to the ribbon splice. In the array
connector, the fibers of each ribbon are epoxied into grooves of a silicon chip so that the fiber ends
protrude from the end of the chip. The chip and the protruding fibers are polished flat for connection.
Each half of the connector is prepared separately before being butt-jointed. A spring clip and two grooved
metal-backed plates are used to align and connect the stacked ribbons of the two ribbon cables. Array
connectors may also use an alignment sleeve with V-grooved silicon chips and metal springs to align and
connect stacked ribbons. Figure 4-19 shows the spring clip method of array connector alignment. The
multifiber array connector is only one example of a multiple connector. Many types of multiple
connectors exist that connect different types of multifiber cables.
