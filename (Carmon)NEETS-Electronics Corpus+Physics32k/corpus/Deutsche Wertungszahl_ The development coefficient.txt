Another constituent is the development coefficient E. It consists of the fundamental value E0, the acceleration factor a and the braking value B:

{\displaystyle E_{0}=\left({\frac {Z_{A}}{1000}}\right)^{4}+J}

The component J depends on the age of the player.
teenagers up to 20 years: J = 5, junior adults (21 – 25 years): J = 10, over-25-year-olds: J = 15

{\displaystyle a={\frac {Z_{A}}{2000}}}

For the acceleration factor a it is claimed: It can't be higher than 1 or lower than 0.5. Furthermore, it is only calculated if the player is less than 20 years old and has achieved more points than expected. The acceleration factor a is 1 if that is not the case. The acceleration factor helps young players to improve their DWZs more quickly.

{\displaystyle B=e^{\frac {1300-Z_{A}}{150}}-1}

The braking value B is only calculated for players with a DWZ of under 1300 points and only if the achieved points are less or equal to the expected ones, else the braking value is zero. The braking value makes the DWZ of poor players decrease not so rapidly.
Besides, E depends on the number of the previously evaluated tournaments. The index i is 1 in the first DWZ and is increased by 1 after every tournament evaluation.
Also consider that:

{\displaystyle 5\leq E\leq {\begin{cases}\min(30;5i),\;\mathrm {if} \;B=0\;\\150,\;\mathrm {if} \;B>0\;\end{cases}}}

This formula is only considered when a DWZ already exists, viz. i is not only zero. So E is normally increased to 5, if the coefficient is less than five, or decreased to thirty if E is higher than 30. If a braking factor is present (B>0), E can also go beyond 30.
The next step is to round E to the nearest integer.
