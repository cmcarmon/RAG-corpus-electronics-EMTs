As stated before, when output power is not of prime importance, transistor oscillators may be biased 
class A to ensure stability and minimize distortion. When this is done, the dc operating point established 
by the power supply is chosen so that the operation of the transistor oscillator occurs over the most linear 
portion of the transistor's characteristic curve. When the operation of the circuit falls into the nonlinear 
portion of the characteristic curve, the transistor's parameters (voltages and currents) vary. These 
parameters are basic to the stable frequency of the transistor oscillator. Operating frequency variations 
may occur with changes in these bias voltages. Thus, a constant supply voltage is a prime requirement for 
good frequency stability.
