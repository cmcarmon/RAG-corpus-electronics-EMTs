Many previous approaches for error detection and correction
of linear numerical computations were based on the use of
checksum schemes (Banerjee et al., 1990; Huang and Abraham,
1984; Jou and Abraham, 1986; Luk and Park, 1988). A function
f is linear if f (u þ v) ¼ f (u) þ f (v), where u and v are vectors.
We discuss here a commonly used checksum technique for a
frequently encountered computation: matrix multiplication.
