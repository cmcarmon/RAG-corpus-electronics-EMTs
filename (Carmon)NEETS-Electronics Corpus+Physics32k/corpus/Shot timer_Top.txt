A shot timer is a shot activated timer used in shooting sports, which starts the competitor by an audible signal and also records the competitor's time electronically by detecting the sound of each shot together with the time from the start signal. When the competitor is finished the timer will show the time from the start signal until the last shot. The time is usually recorded to hundredths of a second (centisecond), which is required by competitions in the International Practical Shooting Confederation.
Some timers come with additional functions:
Par times: The timer first gives a start, then a stop signal after a pre-programmed time.
Instant or delayed start signal: The start signal can either come instantly by the push of the start button, or by a delay between 1 to 4 seconds.
Big board display: The possibility for direct connection to a big board display for instant audience feedback.
The possibility for scoring points on target in addition to the time, with automatic hit factor calculation, making for a complete scoring solution. The results can be loaded to a computer, i.e. by Bluetooth or RF.
