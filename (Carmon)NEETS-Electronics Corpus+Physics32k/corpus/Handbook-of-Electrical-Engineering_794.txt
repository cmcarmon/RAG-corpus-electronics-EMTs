A Bode diagram is drawn by applying a set of simple rules or procedures to a transfer function. The rules
relate directly to the set of poles and zeros and/or time constants of the function. Before constructing a Bode
= 0) has a dc
diagram, the transfer function is normalized so that each pole or zero term (except those at 
gain of one. For instance:
