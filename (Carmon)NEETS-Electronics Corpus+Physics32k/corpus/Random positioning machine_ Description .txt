The RPM is a more sophisticated development of the single-axis clinostat. RPMs usually consist of two independently rotating frames. One frame is positioned inside the other giving a very complex net change of orientation to a biological sample mounted in the middle. The RPM is sometimes wrongly referred to as the "3-D clinostat(which rotates both axis in the same direction, i.e. both clockwise)". It is a microweight ('microgravity') simulator that is based on the principle of 'gravity-vector-averaging'. RPM provides a functional volume which is 'exposed' to simulated microweight. .
