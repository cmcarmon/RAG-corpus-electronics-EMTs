The derivation of the array factor for the two-dimensional
array, as presented below, follows the same procedure used for
a one-dimensional array. The same terminology is also used
for equivalent parameters. Needed are double indexing of the
elements along x and y as well as double summations for
the total Ô¨Åelds, instead of a single summation for a one-
dimensional array:
