Capacitor tests involving quality and value must be made in the course of everyday troubleshooting.
You must make the important decision of whether to reject or continue to use a certain capacitor after it
has been tested. Capacitance measurements are usually accomplished by either a bridge-type or a
reactance-type capacitance meter. The bridge-type capacitance meter is much more accurate than the
reactance-type meter. You may want to review rcl bridges in chapter 1 of NEETS, module 16, before
reading further. Capacitance tolerances vary more widely than resistance tolerances and are dependent
upon the type of capacitor, the capacitance value, and the voltage rating. The results of capacitance tests
must be evaluated to determine whether a particular capacitor will fulfill the requirements of the circuit in
which it is used.
