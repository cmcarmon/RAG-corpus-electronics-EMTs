Bridges are among the most accurate types of measuring devices used in the measurement of 
impedance. In addition, bridges are also used to measure dc resistance, capacitance, and inductance. 
Certain types of bridges are more suitable for measuring a specific characteristic, such as capacitance or 
inductance. Basic schematics for the various bridge circuits are shown in figure 3-1. The bridge circuits 
shown are similar in that they usually contain two branches in the measuring circuit, two branches in the 
comparing circuit, a detector circuit, and a power circuit, as shown in figure 3-2. The bridge shown in 
figure 3-2 is actually the dc Wheatstone bridge; however, the general principles of circuit operation for ac 
remain the same.
