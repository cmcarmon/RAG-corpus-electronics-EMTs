Another problem of changing from first to second gear is that two bands must actuate in synchronism: the planet support of the second gearset must release at the same time as the sun band is actuated. As a result, this is a gear change that tends to be rougher than the others, where just one band is released or actuated. This also means more wear in auto box parts. This is solved by the use of one-way overrun clutches which allow one or more components to "free wheel" when the transmission shifts into a higher gear. GM's Turbo Hydra-Matic 350 and 400 transmissions utilized overrun clutches in both the low and intermediate gears, allowing for fully progressive shifting with no "overlap".
Due to both factors abovementioned, gear changing patterns in some Simpson gearboxes, including modern 4-speed units, avoid first gear as much as they can, going up to 2nd as soon as possible, and especially avoiding reducing to 1st unless absolutely necessary (very slow speed plus floored throttle).
