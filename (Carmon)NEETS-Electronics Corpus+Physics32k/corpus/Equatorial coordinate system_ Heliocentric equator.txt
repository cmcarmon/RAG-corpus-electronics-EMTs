In astronomy, there is also a heliocentric rectangular variant of equatorial coordinates, designated x, y, z, which has:
The origin at the center of the Sun.
The fundamental plane in the plane of the Earth's equator.
The primary direction (the x axis) toward the vernal equinox.
A right-handed convention, specifying a y axis 90° to the east in the fundamental plane and a z axis along Earth's north polar axis.
This frame is in every way equivalent to the ξ, η, ζ frame, above, except that the origin is removed to the center of the Sun. It is commonly used in planetary orbit calculation. The three astronomical rectangular coordinate systems are related by




ξ
=
x
+
X


{\displaystyle \xi =x+X}





η
=
y
+
Y


{\displaystyle \eta =y+Y}





ζ
=
z
+
Z


{\displaystyle \zeta =z+Z}
