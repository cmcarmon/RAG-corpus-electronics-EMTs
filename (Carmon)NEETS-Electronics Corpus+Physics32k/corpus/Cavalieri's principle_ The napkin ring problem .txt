In what is called the napkin ring problem, one shows by Cavalieri's principle that when a hole is drilled straight through the centre of a sphere where the remaining band has height h, the volume of the remaining material surprisingly does not depend on the size of the sphere. The cross-section of the remaining ring is a plane annulus, whose area is the difference between the areas of two circles. By the Pythagorean theorem, the area of one of the two circles is π times r 2 − y 2, where r is the sphere's radius and y is the distance from the plane of the equator to the cutting plane, and that of the other is π times r 2 − (h/2)2. When these are subtracted, the r 2 cancels; hence the lack of dependence of the bottom-line answer upon r.
