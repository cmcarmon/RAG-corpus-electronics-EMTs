As covered, in NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers, an 
alternating current is generated by rotating a coil in the magnetic field between two magnets. As long as 
the magnetic field is uniform, the output from the coil will be a sine wave, as shown in figure 1-2. This 
wave shape is called a sine wave because the voltage of the coil depends on its angular position in the 
magnetic field.
