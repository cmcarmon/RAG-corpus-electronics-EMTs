This chapter is organized as follows. In Section 8.3, the
online fault accommodation control problems of interest are
deﬁned. In Section 8.4, through theoretical analysis, the neces-
sary and sufﬁcient conditions to maintain the system’s online
stability are derived together with the proposed intelligent
fault accommodation technique. The complete multiple
model-based FDA architecture is presented in Section 8.5
with the suggested cost-effective fault detection and diagnosis
scheme. An online simulation study is provided in Section 8.6
to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed online
accommodation technique in various failure scenarios. The
conclusion is included in Section 8.7 with the discussion of
the current and future research directions.
