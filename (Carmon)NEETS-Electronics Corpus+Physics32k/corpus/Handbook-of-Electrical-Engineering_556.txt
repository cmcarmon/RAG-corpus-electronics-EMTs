Figure 5.16 shows a double-ended limiting circuit using back-to-back Zener diodes. Operation is similar to
that shown in Fig. 5.14, but no conventional diode is required. Note that diode D1 is conducting in a forward
direction when  D2 conducts in its reverse breakdown (Zener) region, while  D2 is forward biased when  D1 is
conducting  in  its  reverse  breakdown  region.  Neither  diode  conducts  when  –(VZ2  +  0.7)  <  vo  <  (VZ1  +  0.7),
which is the region of linear ampliﬁer operation.
