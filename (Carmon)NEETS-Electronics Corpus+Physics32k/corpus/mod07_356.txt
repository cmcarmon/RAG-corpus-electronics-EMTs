With a VGG of 1 volt, the microammeter reads .5 microamps. Applying Ohm's law (1V ÷ .5 µA) 
illustrates that this very small amount of current flow results in a very high input impedance (about 2 
megohms). By contrast, a bipolar transistor in similar circumstances would require higher current flow 
(e.g., .1 to −1 mA), resulting in a much lower input impedance (about 1000 ohms or less). The higher 
input impedance of the JFET is possible because of the way reverse-bias gate voltage affects the cross-
sectional area of the channel.
