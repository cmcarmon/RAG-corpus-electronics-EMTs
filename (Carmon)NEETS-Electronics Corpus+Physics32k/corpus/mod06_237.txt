View B of figure 1-27 depicts an amplifier biased into CLASS AB operation. Notice that in this
application, grid bias has been increased to -9 volts. We will assume that the tube reaches cutoff when the
voltage on the grid is -10 volts. Under these conditions, when the input reaches -10 volts, the tube will cut
off and stay cut off until the input goes above -10 volts. The tube conducts during the entire duration of
the positive alternation and part of the negative alternation. If you remember back in the discussion of
distortion, we pointed out that this represents distortion. In some amplifiers, faithful reproduction of the
input is not an important requirement. Class AB amplifiers are used only where this distortion can be
tolerated.
