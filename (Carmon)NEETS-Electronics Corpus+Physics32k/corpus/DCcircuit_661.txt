As was stated earlier, most meter movements are sensitive devices. Some D’Arsonval move-
ments have full-scale deﬂection current ratings as little as 50 µA, with an (internal) wire re-
sistance of less than 1000 Ω. This makes for a voltmeter with a full-scale rating of only 50
millivolts (50 µA X 1000 Ω)! In order to build voltmeters with practical (higher voltage) scales
from such sensitive movements, we need to ﬁnd some way to reduce the measured quantity of
voltage down to a level the movement can handle.
