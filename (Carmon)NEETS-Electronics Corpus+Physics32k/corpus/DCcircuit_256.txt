That last detail leads us into another hazard of electric shock, this one peculiar to public
power systems. Though our initial study of electric circuits will focus almost exclusively on DC
(Direct Current, or electricity that moves in a continuous direction in a circuit), modern power
systems utilize alternating current, or AC. The technical reasons for this preference of AC over
DC in power systems are irrelevant to this discussion, but the special hazards of each kind of
electrical power are very important to the topic of safety.
