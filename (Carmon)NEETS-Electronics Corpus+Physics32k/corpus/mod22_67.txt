None of this work could be performed by a computer without first instructing the computer how to 
do it by means of a list of instructions called a program. The instructions in the program must be written 
in one of the languages the computer understands. The most popular generic term for computer programs 
is software (this is covered in chapter 3). Hardware (covered in chapter 2), of course, refers to the 
computer and related equipment. It is easy to say that both computer hardware and software are 
interdependent because neither can perform useful work without the other. Digital computers may be 
either special or general purpose.
