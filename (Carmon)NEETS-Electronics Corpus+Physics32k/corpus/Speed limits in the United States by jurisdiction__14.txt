The speed limit on most rural Interstates is 70 mph. Urban Interstate speed limits generally vary from 55 mph to 65 mph. Sections of I-64 and I-68 have lower truck speed limits because of steep grades; otherwise, West Virginia does not post separate truck speed limits. The West Virginia Turnpike between Chelyan and Mahan has a 60 mph speed limit because of sharp curves.
Speed limits on 4-lane divided highways are normally 65 mph although some stretches within cities are posted as low as 50 mph. Open country highways have a statutory limit of 55 mph, which includes most rural two-lane highways and even includes some one lane back country roads or any road without a posted speed limit. Cities and towns set their own speed limits, which are usually between 25 and 55 mph. School zones have a statutory speed limit of 20 mph. Speed limits are commonly reduced by 15 mph in work zones.
On April 7, 2017, the House of Delegates passed a resolution that asks the Department of Highways to study increasing the speed limit to 75 mph on rural interstates where deemed safe.
On January 10, 2018, West Virginia lawmakers made a bill which would increase speed limits on interstates and limited access highways in rural areas to 80 mph. If that is done, West Virginia could become the 8th state to increase its speed limit to 80 mph, and it would be the third eastern state with a speed limit of greater than 70 mph.
