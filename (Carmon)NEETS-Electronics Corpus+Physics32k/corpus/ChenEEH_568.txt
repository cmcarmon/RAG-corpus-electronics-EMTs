The voltage drop across the series resistor in the Schottky
diode rises rapidly with the breakdown voltage rating. This
restricts the operating voltage range of Schottky diodes even as
reverse recovery limits high-frequency operation of P-i-N
diodes. Hybrid devices such as junction barrier Schottky and
merged P-i-Nâ€“Schottky diodes have been developed to expand
the operating range of power diodes by taking advantage of the
properties of Schottky and P-i-N diodes.
