The current coil (stationary coil) of the wattmeter is connected in series with the circuit (load), and
the potential coil (movable coil) is connected across the line. When line current flows through the current
coil of a wattmeter, a field is set up around the coil. The strength of this field is proportional to the line
current and in phase with it. The potential coil of the wattmeter generally has a high-resistance resistor
connected in series with it. This is for the purpose of making the potential-coil circuit of the meter as
purely resistive as possible. As a result, current in the potential circuit is practically in phase with line
voltage. Therefore, when voltage is applied to the potential circuit, current is proportional to and in phase
with the line voltage.
