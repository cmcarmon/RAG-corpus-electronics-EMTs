PPS signals are usually generated as a TTL signal capable of driving a 1 kilohm load. Some sources use line drivers in order to be capable of driving 50 ohm transmission lines. Because of the broad frequency contents, a long transmission line can have significant impact on the shape of the PPS signal due to dispersion and after delivery effects of the dielectric of the transmission line. It is common to set t0 at the voltage level of the steepest slope of a PPS signal. PPS signals are therefore notoriously unreliable when time transfer accuracies better than a ns are needed, although the stability of a PPS signal can reach into the ps regime depending on the generating device.
