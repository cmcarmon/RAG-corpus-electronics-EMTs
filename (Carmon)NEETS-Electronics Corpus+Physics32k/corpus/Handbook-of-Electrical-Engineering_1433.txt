One key consideration for linear predictive analysis is the order of the model, p. For speech, if the order is
too small, the formant structure is not well represented. If the order is too large, pitch pulses as well as formants
begin to be represented. Tenth- or twelfth-order analysis is typical for speech. Figures 15.11 and 15.12 provide
examples  of  the  spectrum  produced  by  eighth-order  and  sixteenth-order  linear  predictive  analysis  of  the  /i/
waveform of Fig. 15.7. Figure 15.11 shows there to be three formants at frequencies of about 300, 2300, and
3200 Hz, which are typical for an /i/.
