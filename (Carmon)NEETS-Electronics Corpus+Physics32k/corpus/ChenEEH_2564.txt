A lossless resonator yields an inﬁnite Q. If the resonator is
completely isolated from external
loading or coupling, the
resulting Q is called the unloaded Qu. Otherwise, the term
loaded QL is used to account for external loading effects. QL is
always lower than Qu as long as the external coupling or load is
passive. External loading effects are also extracted by a term
called external Qe that can be deﬁned in the same way as
equation 7.15, except that in this case the loss Ploss is due to
the energy transferred to the external circuitry. The loaded QL
can be expressed as:
