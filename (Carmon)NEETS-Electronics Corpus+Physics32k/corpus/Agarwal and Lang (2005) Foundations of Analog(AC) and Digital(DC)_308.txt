In other words, the energy supplied by the source is given by −9 mW. Clearly the
energy supplied by the source is not equal to the energy dissipated by the resistor, and
so i = 3 mA is incorrect. Notice that if we reverse the polarity of i, energy will be
conserved. Thus, i = −3 mA is the correct answer.
