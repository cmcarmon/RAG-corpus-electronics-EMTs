Other metric preﬁxes exist to symbolize powers of ten for extremely small and extremely
large multipliers. On the extremely small end of the spectrum, femto (f) = 10−15, atto (a) =
10−18, zepto (z) = 10−21, and yocto (y) = 10−24. On the extremely large end of the spectrum,
Peta (P) = 1015, Exa (E) = 1018, Zetta (Z) = 1021, and Yotta (Y) = 1024.
