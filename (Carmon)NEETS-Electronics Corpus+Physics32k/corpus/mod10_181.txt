If the two plates of the capacitor are spread farther apart, the electric field must curve to meet the
plates at right angles (fig. 1-26). The straight lines in view A of figure 1-26 become arcs in view B, and
approximately semicircles in view C, where the plates are in a straight line. Instead of flat metal plates, as
in the capacitor, the two elements can take the form of metal rods or wires and form the basic antenna.
