The relationship below provides a way to determine the volume-based concentration of any individual gaseous component





p

i


=

p

total



c

i




{\displaystyle p_{i}=p_{\text{total}}c_{i}}

where ci is the concentration of the ith component.
Dalton's law is not strictly followed by real gases, with the deviation increasing with pressure. Under such conditions the volume occupied by the molecules becomes significant compared to the free space between them. In particular, the short average distances between molecules increases intermolecular forces between gas molecules enough to substantially change the pressure exerted by them, an effect not included in the ideal gas model.
