Because of the absence of mechanical contact and lubricating ï¬‚uids, magnetic bearings
can be operated in high vacuum at higher speeds with extremely low friction, low noise, and
longer operating life. With no risk of contamination by oil or gas, and with less heat dissipation,
it is possible to ascertain clean, stable, and accurate operating conditions with reliability and
repeatability. In space technology the magnetic bearings are used successfully in reaction,
momentum, and energy wheels, helium pumps, and telescope pointing. Terrestrial applications
include scanners, high-vacuum pumps, beam choppers in high vacuum, energy storage wheels,
and accurate smooth rotating machines. The magnetic bearings in a reaction wheel are shown in
Figure 11.8.1.
