The 1987 Bintaro train crash was a catastrophic collision between two passenger trains in Pondok Betung urban village, Bintaro, Tangerang, Indonesia on 19 October 1987. There were 156 fatalities, making it the worst railway crash in Indonesia to date.
A train departing from Rangkasbitung in West Java province collided with a train from Tanah Abang Station in Jakarta. An investigation indicated negligence from a station officer who gave a safe signal to the train from Rangkasbitung, despite the absence of safety confirmation from Kebayoran Station. The safe signal was given because lines at Sudimara Station were crowded.
