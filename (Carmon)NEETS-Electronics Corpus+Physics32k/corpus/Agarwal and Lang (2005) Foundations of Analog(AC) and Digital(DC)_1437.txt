In this exam-
ple, we will examine how wire length becomes an important issue in the design of VLSI
chips. Consider the inverter pair circuit in Figure 10.14. Suppose the two inverters are
on the opposite ends of a chip that is 1 cm on a side. The resulting long wire connecting
them can no longer be treated as an ideal conductor with no resistance or capacitance.
Instead we must replace the wire with an ideal wire in combination with a wire capaci-
tance and a wire resistance. The resulting RC delays can be significantly higher than the
RC delays of inverters connected to each other with short wires.
