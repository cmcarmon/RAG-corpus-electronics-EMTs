wire for all connections to negative voltage (–V) or to ground is common 
practice. For AC circuits, use green wire for ground connections. Yellow or 
orange wire is often used for input signals, such as the signal from a micro-
phone into a circuit. If you keep lots of different colors of wire handy, you can 
color‐code your component connections so it’s easier to tell what’s going on 
in a circuit just by glancing at it (unless, of course, you’re colorblind).
