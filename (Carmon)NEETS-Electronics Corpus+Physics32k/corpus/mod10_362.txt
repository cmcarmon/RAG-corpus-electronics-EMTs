Wind, air temperature, and water content of the atmosphere can combine in many ways. Certain 
combinations can cause radio signals to be heard hundreds of miles beyond the ordinary range of radio 
communications. Conversely, a different combination of factors can cause such attenuation of the signal 
that it may not be heard even over a normally satisfactory path. Unfortunately, there are no hard and fast 
rules on the effects of weather on radio transmissions since the weather is extremely complex and subject 
to frequent change. We will, therefore, limit our discussion on the effects of weather on radio waves to 
general terms.
