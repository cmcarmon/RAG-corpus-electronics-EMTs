In	the	world	of	circuitry,	it’s	important	to	be	informed	of	the	concepts	of	EDA;	it
privileges	a	circuit	creator	with	a	good	grasp	of	the	proper	way	to	build	circuits.
The	employees	of	grand	electronics	companies	such	as	Intel,	Hewlett	Packard,	and
Valid	Logic	Systems	are	all	trained	to	have	impressive	knowledge	of	the	tools,
despite	already	having	gone	through	years	of	education.
Through	the	years,	EDA	tools	have	undergone	continuous	development.	Initially,
the	concepts	were	rather	limited;	in	the	Age	of	EDA	Invention,	the	focus	was
merely	on	routing,	logic	synthesis,	static	analysis,	and	placement.	Eventually,	in
the	Age	of	EDA	Implementation,	these	concepts	were	subjected	to	major
improvements;	more	sophisticated	and	advanced	algorithm	for	the	EDA	tools
were	considered.	Come	the	Age	of	EDA	Integration,	they	were	further	studied	and
were	designed	to	cater	to	integrated	environments.
Now,	you	may	be	wondering	why	there	is	a	need	to	build	circuits	manually	when
there	are	EDA	tools.	Well,	although	the	process	can	be	accomplished	easier	and
faster,	sometimes,	bringing	the	expertise	of	a	circuit	engineer	on	the	table	is
recommended;	this	way,	he	can	thoroughly	evaluate	the	quality	of	a	circuit’s
system.
Additionally,	the	operators	of	EDA	tools	are	selected	carefully;	usually,	they	are
