uniform ﬁeld, on which an additional ﬁeld is imposed due to the introduction of a current-carrying
conductor. For the case in which the current is directed into and perpendicular to the plane of
the paper, the resultant ﬂux distribution is depicted in Figure 12.1.4(b). It can be seen that in the
neighborhood of the conductor the resultant ﬂux density is greater than B on one side and less
than B on the other side. The direction of the mechanical force developed is such that it tends to
restore the ﬁeld to its original undisturbed and uniform conﬁguration. Figure 12.1.4(c) shows the
conditions corresponding to the current being in the opposite direction to that of Figure 12.1.4(b).
The force is always in such a direction that the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld is minimized.
Figure 12.1.5 shows a one-turn coil in a magnetic ﬁeld and illustrates how torque is produced by
forces caused by the interaction between current-carrying conductors and magnetic ﬁelds.
