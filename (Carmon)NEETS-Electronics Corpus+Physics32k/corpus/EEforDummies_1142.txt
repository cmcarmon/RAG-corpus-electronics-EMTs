Think of your multimeter as an electronic component in your circuit (because 
in a way, it is). If you want to measure voltage, your meter must be placed 
in parallel with the section of the circuit you’re measuring because voltages 
across parallel branches of a circuit are the same. If you want to measure cur-
rent, your meter must be placed in series with the section of the circuit you 
are measuring because components in a series circuit carry the same current.
