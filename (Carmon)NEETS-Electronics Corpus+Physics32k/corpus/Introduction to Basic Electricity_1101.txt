Inspect insulated tools frequently, watching for any 
wear or cracking of the insulation. Keep tools clean, 
dry, and free of surface contaminants, which can com-
promise their insulating properties. If cutting, wear, or 
a burn has breached the dielectric insulation, the tool 
should not be used to ensure safety.
