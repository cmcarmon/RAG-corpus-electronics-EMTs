Many different methods can be used to measure standing wave ratio. The most intuitive method uses a slotted line which is a section of transmission line with an open slot which allows a probe to detect the actual voltage at various points along the line. Thus the maximum and minimum values can be compared directly. This method is used at VHF and higher frequencies. At lower frequencies, such lines are impractically long. Directional couplers can be used at HF through microwave frequencies and respond only to waves travelling either in the forward or reverse direction. From these two values we can derive SWR. The computations can be done mathematically or using graphical methods built into the meter as an additional scale or by reading from the crossing point between two needles on the same meter. Various types of circuits can be used to measure the complex voltage and current at the measuring point and to use those values to derive SWR. These methods can provide more information than just SWR or forward and reflected power. Some modern transmitters include a graphical display of complex load vs frequency. Stand alone antenna analyzers also are available that measure much more than simple SWR using various measuring methods.
