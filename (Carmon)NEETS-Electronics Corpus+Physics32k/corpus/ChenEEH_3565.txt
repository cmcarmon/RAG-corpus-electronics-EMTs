However, when processing data with a computer or with a
digital signal processor, both variables can assume only discrete
values. This means that not only is the signal discrete in time
but also in amplitude. These signals are referred to as digital
signals. Therefore, if a signal has to be processed in digital
form, ﬁrst its independent variable and then its dependent
variable are converted from continuous to discrete form
through sampling and quantization respectively. Quantiza-
tion is the process that converts data from inﬁnite or high
precision to ﬁnite or lower precision.
