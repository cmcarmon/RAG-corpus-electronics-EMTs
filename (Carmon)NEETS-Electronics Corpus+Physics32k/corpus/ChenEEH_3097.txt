where Tem is the electromagnetic torque delivered to the load,
Tload is the load torque, J is the moment of inertial of load and
motor, and vm is the mechanical angular frequency [radians
per second]. Figure 4.7 illustrates a typical motor and load
torque characteristic. At point a, the motor torque is greater
than the load torque and the system accelerates. At point b, the
load torque is greater than the motor torque and the system
decelerates. Point c is a stable equilibrium point, and the
system will operate at this speed.
