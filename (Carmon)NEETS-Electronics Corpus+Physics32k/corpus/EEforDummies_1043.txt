Even if you purchase a large assortment of prestripped wires, there may come 
a time when you have to make an interconnect wire or two of your own. Start 
with 20‐ or 22‐gauge wire (or a longer prestripped section that you want to 
cut into smaller sections), and cut it to the desired length. If you have a wire 
stripper with a gauge‐selection dial, set the dial for the gauge of wire you’re 
using. Other wire strippers may have several cutting notches labeled for vari-
ous gauges. Using one of these gauge‐specific devices instead of a generic 
wire stripper prevents you from nicking the wire when you’re stripping the 
insulation. Nicks weaken the wire, and a weak wire can get stuck inside a 
breadboard hole and ruin your whole day.
