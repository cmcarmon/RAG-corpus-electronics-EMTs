When placed in an electric or a magnetic Ô¨Åeld, a bianisotropic medium becomes both polarized and magnetized.
Magnetoelectric  materials,  theoretically  predicted  by  Dzyaloshinskii  and  by  Landau  and  Lifshitz,  were
observed  experimentally  in  1960  by Astrov  in  antiferromagnetic  chromium  oxide.  The  constitutive  relations
that Dzyaloshinskii proposed for chromium oxide have the following form:
