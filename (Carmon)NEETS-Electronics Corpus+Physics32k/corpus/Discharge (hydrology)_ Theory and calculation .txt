GH Dury and MJ Bradshaw are two hydrologists who devised the models showing the relationship between discharge and other variables in a river. The Bradshaw model described how pebble size and other variables change from source to mouth; while Dury considered the relationships between discharge and variables such as stream slope and friction.
The units that are typically used to express discharge include m³/s (cubic meters per second), ft³/s (cubic feet per second or cfs) and/or acre-feet per day. For example, the average discharge of the Rhine river in Europe is 2,200 cubic metres per second (78,000 cu ft/s) or 190,000,000 cubic metres (150,000 acre⋅ft) per day.
A commonly applied methodology for measuring, and estimating, the discharge of a river is based on a simplified form of the continuity equation. The equation implies that for any incompressible fluid, such as liquid water, the discharge (Q) is equal to the product of the stream's cross-sectional area (A) and its mean velocity (

), and is written as:

{\displaystyle Q=A\,{\bar {u}}}

where




Q


{\displaystyle Q}
is the discharge ([L3T−1]; m3/s or ft3/s)




A


{\displaystyle A}
is the cross-sectional area of the portion of the channel occupied by the flow ([L2]; m2 or ft2)







u

{\displaystyle {\bar {u}}}
is the average flow velocity ([LT−1]; m/s or ft/s)
