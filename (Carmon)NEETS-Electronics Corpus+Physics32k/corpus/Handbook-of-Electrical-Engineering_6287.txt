Solid state transmitters typically incorporate a massively parallel design to achieve the necessary power levels.
So-called  power  blocks  of  1  kW  or  greater  are  combined  as  required  to  meet  the  target  transmitter  power
output.  Most  designs  use  MOSFETs  running  in  a  class  D  (or  higher)  switching  mode.  Any  one  of  several
combiner schemes may be used to couple the power blocks to the load. Depending on the design, high-reliability
features may be incorporated into the transmitter, including automatic disconnection of failed power blocks
and hot-changing of defective modules.
