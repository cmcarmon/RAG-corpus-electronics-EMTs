where  T  is  temperature  (K),  RT  is  the  resistance  (W),  and  A,  B  are  constants  determined  by  conducting
experiments at two temperatures and solving the equations simultaneously. Positive thermistors have a PTC
only between certain temperature ranges. Outside this range the temperature is either zero or negative. Typically,
the absolute value of the temperature coefﬁcient of resistance for PTC resistors is much higher than for NTC
resistors.
