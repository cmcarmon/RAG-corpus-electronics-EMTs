Finally, using the frequency response plot in Figure 14.11 or Figure 14.12,
on the basis of Equation 14.20, it is relatively simple to visualize the filtering
that occurs when a signal is passed through the resonant circuit. Any frequency
components near the resonant frequency will pass through the system relatively
unattenuated, but all other frequency components will be substantially atten-
uated and shifted in phase. If, for example the filter input is a 990-Hz square
wave, and the filter resonant frequency is 3000 Hz, the output will be nearly
sinusoidal at 2970 Hz, because the filter will pass this third-harmonic compo-
nent of the square wave and reject the fundamental and other harmonics. As
mentioned previously, this signal-processing property of filtering is fundamen-
tal to the operation of all television, radio, and cellular phone receivers, which
must select one transmitted signal from among many present at the receiver
antenna.
