The WAVEGUIDE is classified as a transmission line. However, the method by which it transmits
energy down its length differs from the conventional methods. Waveguides are cylindrical, elliptical, or
rectangular (cylindrical and rectangular shapes are shown in figure 3-8). The rectangular waveguide is
used more frequently than the cylindrical waveguide.
