Essentially all of the worldâ€™s electric power is generated by
synchronous machines,
the device in the power system
where mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy.
Further, much of the power system control is done via the
synchronous machine. Synchronous motors have their appli-
cations as well, especially when constant speed operation is
important. In terms of energy conversion, though, the syn-
chronous machine is far more important as a generator, and
this section describes the generating aspect of synchronous
machines.
