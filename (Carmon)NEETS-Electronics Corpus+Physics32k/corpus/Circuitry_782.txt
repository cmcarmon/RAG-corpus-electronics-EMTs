SPICE 
Circuit Emphasis).  
  Results  of  circuit  analysis  can  be  displayed  in 
various ways, including displays that simulate those 
of  real  test  instruments  (these  are  sometimes 
referred  to  as  virtual  instruments).  A  further 
benefit  of  using  electronic  circuit  simulation 
software  is  that,  when  a  circuit  design  has  been 
finalized, it is usually possible to export a file from 
the  design/simulation  software  to  a  PCB  layout 
package. It may also be possible to export files for 
use in screen printing or CNC drilling. This greatly 
reduces the time that it takes to produce a finished 
electronic circuit.
