Specific yield, also known as the drainable porosity, is a ratio, less than or equal to the effective porosity, indicating the volumetric fraction of the bulk aquifer volume that a given aquifer will yield when all the water is allowed to drain out of it under the forces of gravity:

V

T






{\displaystyle S_{y}={\frac {V_{wd}}{V_{T}}}}

where





V

w
d




{\displaystyle V_{wd}}
is the volume of water drained, and





V

T




{\displaystyle V_{T}}
is the total rock or material volume
It is primarily used for unconfined aquifers, since the elastic storage component,




S

s




{\displaystyle S_{s}}
, is relatively small and usually has an insignificant contribution. Specific yield can be close to effective porosity, but there are several subtle things which make this value more complicated than it seems. Some water always remains in the formation, even after drainage; it clings to the grains of sand and clay in the formation. Also, the value of specific yield may not be fully realized for a very long time, due to complications caused by unsaturated flow.
