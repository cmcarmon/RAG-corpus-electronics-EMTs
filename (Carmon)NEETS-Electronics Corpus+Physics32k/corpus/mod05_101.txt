VOLTAGE REGULATION should not be confused with VOLTAGE CONTROL. As described 
previously, voltage regulation is an internal action occurring within the generator whenever the load 
changes. Voltage control is an imposed action, usually through an external adjustment, for the purpose of 
increasing or decreasing terminal voltage.
