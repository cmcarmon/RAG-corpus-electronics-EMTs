Trace gases can react with each other, leading to imbalances that can deeply affect the life on Earth. For example, certain halogen species, such as odd-chlorine species (ClO, HCl, HOCl, ClONO2) or iodine and bromine species are involved in the destruction of ozone, through chemical reactions. On the other hand, nitrogen compounds can play a part both in the destruction and creation of ozone and a balanced can be reached.
