Circuits often have more complex combinations of resistances than simple 
series or parallel relationships, and figuring out equivalent resistances isn’t 
always easy. You have to use matrix mathematics to analyze them, and 
because this book isn’t a math book, I’m not going to detour to explore the 
complexities of matrix math.
