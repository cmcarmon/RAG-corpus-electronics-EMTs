The connection pathway between the host and the disk device varies widely depending on the desired level
of performance. A low-end workstation or personal computer would use a SCSI interface to directly connect the
device to the host. A higher end ﬁle server or minicomputer would typically use a separate disk controller to
manage several devices at the same time. These devices attach to the controller through SMD interfaces. It is the
controller’s responsibility to implement error checking and corrections and direct memory transfer to the host.
Mainframes tend to have more devices and more complex interconnection schemes to access them. In IBM
