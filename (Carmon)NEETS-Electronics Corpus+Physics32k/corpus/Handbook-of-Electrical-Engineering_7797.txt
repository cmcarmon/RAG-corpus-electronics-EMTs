One scheme often proposed to enhance the capacity entails the use of multiple zones, where either the rotation
speed 1 or the clock period Tc is allowed to vary from one zone to the next. In general, zoning schemes can reduce
the minimum usable track radius below that given by Eq. (80.8). More importantly, however, they allow tracks
with larger radii to store more data than tracks with smaller radii. The capacity of the zoned disk is somewhere
between C of Eq. (80.7) and C0 of Eq. (80.2), the exact value depending on the number of zones implemented.
