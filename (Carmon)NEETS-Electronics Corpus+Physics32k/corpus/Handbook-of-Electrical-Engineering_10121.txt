Currently gantry robot cells are being set up which allow manufacturers to place a sheet of material in
the gantry’s work envelope and begin automatic cutting, trimming, drilling, milling, assembly and ﬁnishing
operations  which  completely  manufacture  a  part  or  subassembly  using  quick-change  tools  and  pro-
grammed subroutines.
