There are two basic types of optical fibers, multimode fibers and single mode fibers. Chapter 2
discusses the differences between the fiber types. In 1970, Corning Glass Works made a multimode fiber
with losses under 20 dB/km. This same company, in 1972, made a high silica-core multimode optical
fiber with 4dB/km minimum attenuation (loss). Currently, multimode fibers can have losses as low as 0.5
dB/km at wavelengths around 1300 nm. Single mode fibers are available with losses lower than 0.25
dB/km at wavelengths around 1500 nm.
