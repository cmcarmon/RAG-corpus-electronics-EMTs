As expected, the corresponding time constants approach L/R and RC, the
time constants of an independent inductor-resistor circuit and an independent
capacitor-resistor circuit. Note that, for over-damped dynamics, α > ω◦ from
which it follows that L/R is the faster time constant and RC is the slower time
constant.
