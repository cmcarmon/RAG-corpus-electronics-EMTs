The problem of bias, which is the distorting influences of present knowledge, beliefs, and feelings on recollection of previous experiences. Sometimes what people remember from their past says less about what actually happened than about what they personally believe, feel, and the knowledge they have acquired at the present time. An individuals current moods can bias their memory recall, researchers have found. There are three types of memory biases, consistency bias, change bias and egocentric bias. Consistency bias is the bias to reconstruct the past to fit the present. Change bias is the tendency to exaggerate differences between what we feel or believe in the present and what we previously felt or believed in the past. Egocentric bias is a form of change bias, the tendency to exaggerate the change between the past and the present in order to make ourselves look good in any given situation.
