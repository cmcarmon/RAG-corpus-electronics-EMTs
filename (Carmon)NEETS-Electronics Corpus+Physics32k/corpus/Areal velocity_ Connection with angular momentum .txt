In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δt by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle ABC. As Δt approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a limit.
Let the point D be the fourth corner of parallelogram ABDC shown in the figure, so that the vectors AB and AC add up by the parallelogram rule to vector AD. Then the area of triangle ABC is half the area of parallelogram ABDC, and the area of ABDC is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC. This area can also be viewed as a vector with this magnitude, pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram; this vector is the cross product itself:

The areal velocity is this vector area divided by Δt in the limit that Δt becomes vanishingly small:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d{\vec {A}}}{dt}}={\frac {{\vec {r}}\times {\vec {v}}}{2}}.}

On the other hand, the angular momentum of the particle is

{\displaystyle {\vec {L}}={\vec {r}}\times m{\vec {v}},}

and hence the angular momentum equals 2m times the areal velocity.
Conservation of areal velocity is a general property of central force motion, and, within the context of classical mechanics, is equivalent to the conservation of angular momentum.
