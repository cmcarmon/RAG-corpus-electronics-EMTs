The digital compressed video signal can be used as a replacement for an analog video distribution. Digital
coding technology can be used to compress video signals to reduce data rates to 2 Mbps or even lower and
reproduce near broadcast-quality video. Distribution of digital video signals at such rates requires less tran-
sponder bandwidth and a smaller antenna at remote terminals. Compression techniques used are based on one
or  a  combination  of  the  following:  inter/intra-frame  prediction,  adaptive  differential  transform,  conditional
replenishment, discrete cosine transform, adaptive prediction, motion compensation, and vector quantization
[Patterson and Delp, 1990].
