Motion-triggered contact insufficiency (MTCI) describes the effect of increased contact resistance occurring during or after mechanical stress or movement of an electrical contact system, sometimes appearing after a considerable amount of use, independent of electric current, difficult to detect due to temporary nature.
It covers effects related to:
fretting corrosion, a wear-off of the contacting surface
passivation
rolling of contacts
contamination
