In radiometry, radiant exposure or fluence is the radiant energy received by a surface per unit area, or equivalently the irradiance of a surface integrated over time of irradiation, and spectral exposure or is the radiant exposure per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether the spectrum is taken as a function of frequency or of wavelength. The SI unit of radiant exposure is the joule per square metre (J/m2), while that of spectral exposure in frequency is the joule per square metre per hertz (J⋅m−2⋅Hz−1) and that of spectral exposure in wavelength is the joule per square metre per metre (J/m3)—commonly the joule per square metre per nanometre (J⋅m−2⋅nm−1).
