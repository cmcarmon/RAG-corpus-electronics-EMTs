The modern age of power electronics began with the introduction of thyristors in the late 1950s. Now there
are several types of power devices available for high-power and high-frequency applications. The most notable
power devices are gate turn-off thyristors, power Darlington transistors, power MOSFETs, and insulated-gate
bipolar  transistors  (IGBTs).  Power  semiconductor  devices  are  the  most  important  functional  elements  in  all
power conversion applications. The power devices are mainly used as switches to convert power from one form
to another. They are used in motor control systems, uninterrupted power supplies, high-voltage dc transmission,
power  supplies,  induction  heating,  and  in  many  other  power  conversion  applications. A  review  of  the  basic
characteristics of these power devices is presented in this section.
