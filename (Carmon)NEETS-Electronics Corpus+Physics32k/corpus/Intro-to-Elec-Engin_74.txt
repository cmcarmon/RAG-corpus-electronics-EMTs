where ρT 2 and ρT 1 are resistivities at temperatures T2 and T1, respectively, and T is a temperature
constant that depends on the conductor material. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius. The
conductor resistance also depends on other factors, such as spiraling, frequency (the skin effect
which causes the ac resistance to be slightly higher than the dc resistance), and current magnitude
in the case of magnetic conductors (e.g., steel conductors used for shield wires).
