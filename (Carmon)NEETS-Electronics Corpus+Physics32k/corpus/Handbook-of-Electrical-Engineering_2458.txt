Transfer Characteristics
Transfer Equation
Now we will consider the transfer characteristics of the JFET, which is a graph of the output current IDS vs. the
input voltage VGS in the active region. In Fig. 24.11 a transfer characteristic curve for a JFET with VP =  –4 V
and IDSS = +10 mA is given. This is approximately a square-law relationship as given by IDS = IDSS [1 – (VG S /VP)]2.
This equation is not valid for VGS beyond VP (i.e., VGS < VP), for in this region the channel is pinched off and
IDS @ 0.
