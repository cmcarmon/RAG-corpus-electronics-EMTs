Diodes  D1  and  D2  are  present  to  damp  out “ringing”  that  can  occur,  for  example,  when  fast  voltage  level
shifts are propagated down an appreciable length (20 cm or more) of microstripline formed by printed circuit
board interconnections. Negative overshoots are clamped to the 0.7 V across the diode.
