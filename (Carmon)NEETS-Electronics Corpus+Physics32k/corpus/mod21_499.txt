Figure 5-13 shows a typical spectrum analyzer. The previously mentioned measurement capabilities 
can be seen with a spectrum analyzer. However, you will find that the spectrum analyzer generally is used 
to measure spectral purity of multiplex signals, percentage of modulation of AM signals, and modulation 
characteristics of fm and pulse-modulated signals. The spectrum analyzer is also used to interpret the 
displayed spectra of pulsed rf emitted from a radar transmitter.
