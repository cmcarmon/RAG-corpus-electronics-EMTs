TaAs is the first discovered Weyl semimetal (conductor). Large-size (~1 cm), high-quality TaAs single crystals can be obtained by chemical vapor transport method using iodine as the transport agent.
TaAs crystallizes in a body-centered tetragonal unit cell with lattice constants a = 3.44 Å and c = 11.64 Å and space group I41md (No. 109). Ta and As atoms are six coordinated to each other. It should be noted that this structure lacks a horizontal mirror plane and thus inversion symmetry, which is essential to realize Weyl semimetal.
TaAs single crystals have shiny facets, which can be divided into three groups: the two truncated surfaces are {001}, the trapezoid or isosceles triangular surfaces are {101}, and the rectangular ones {112}. TaAs belongs to point group 4mm, the equivalent {101} and {112} planes should form a ditetragonal appearance. The observed morphology can be vary of degenerated cases of the ideal form.
