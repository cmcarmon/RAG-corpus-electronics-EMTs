Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat. If there is no dark energy, it is also the density for which the expansion of the Universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse. From the Friedmann equations, the value for

{\displaystyle \rho _{c}={\frac {3H_{0}^{2}}{8\pi G}}}

where G is the gravitational constant and H0 is the present value of the Hubble constant. The current value for H0, due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is H0 = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of 0.85×10−26 kg/m3 (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), cold dark matter (26.8%), and dark energy (68.3%). Note that although neutrinos are defined as particles like electrons, they are listed separately because they are difficult to detect and so different from ordinary matter. The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or 4.08×10−28 kg/m3. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the Universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the comoving distance (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light years. Thus, volume (4/3πr3) equals 3.58×1080 m3 and the mass of ordinary matter equals density (4.08×10−28 kg/m3) times volume (3.58×1080 m3) or 1.46×1053 kg.
