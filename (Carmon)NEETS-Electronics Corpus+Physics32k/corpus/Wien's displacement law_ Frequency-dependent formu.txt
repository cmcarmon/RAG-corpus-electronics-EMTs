{\displaystyle \nu _{\max }={\alpha  \over h}kT\approx (5.879\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm {Hz/K} )\cdot T}

where α ≈ 2.8214391... is a constant resulting from the numerical solution of the maximization equation, k is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, and T is the temperature (in kelvins). Note that with the emission now considered per unit frequency, this peak now corresponds to a wavelength some 70% longer than the peak considered per unit wavelength. The relevant math is detailed in the next section.
