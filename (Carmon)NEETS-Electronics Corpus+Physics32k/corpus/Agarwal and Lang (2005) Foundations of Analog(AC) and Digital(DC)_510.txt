This simple relation between voltage and current at a pair of terminals
applies regardless of the complexity of the network, provided only that the
network is linear. Thus, returning to the questions posed earlier, if we specify
the open-circuit voltage and the Th√©venin equivalent resistance of the battery, or
the computer power supply, or the wall outlet, then to the extent that such
systems can be considered to be linear, we have completely characterized the
system as it appears at its terminals.
