ADVANTAGES.â€”In normal reception, fm signals are almost totally absent of static while AM
signals are subject to cracking noises and whistles. Fm followed AM in development and has the
advantage of operating at a higher frequency where a greater amount of frequencies are available. Fm
signals provide much more realistic sound reproduction because of an increase in the number of
sidebands. This increase in the number of sidebands allows more of the original audio signal to be
transmitted and, therefore, a greater range of frequencies for you to hear.
