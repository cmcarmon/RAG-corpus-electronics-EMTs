Fortunately,  the  principle  of  the  basic  step-down  
type 
is  quite  
straightforward. Take a look at the circuit diagram 
shown in Fig. 6.27. With S1 closed, the switching 
diode, D, will be reverse biased and will thus be in 
a non-conducting  state.  Current  will  flow  through 
the  inductor,  L,  charging  the  capacitor,  C,  and 
delivering current to the load, RL.
