The Common-Emitter Bypass Capacitor CE
In a CE circuit such as that of Fig. 24.29, suppose Cc is large so that the low-frequency –3-dB point fL is deﬁned
only by the parallel combination of the resistance at the emitter and CE. It will now be seen why the emitter-
follower  work  is  relevant:  the  resistance  appearing  at  the  emitter  of  the  CE  stage  is  the  same  as  the  output
resistance of the emitter-follower stage, and this will now appear in parallel with RE. If this parallel resistance
is renamed Remitter , then, neglecting rbb9 ,
