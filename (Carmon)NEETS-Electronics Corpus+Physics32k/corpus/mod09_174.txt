A low-pass filter passes all currents having a frequency below a specified frequency, while opposing 
all currents having a frequency above this specified frequency. This action is illustrated in its ideal form 
in view (A) of figure 1-15. At frequency cutoff, known as fc the current decreases from maximum to zero. 
At all frequencies above fc the filter presents infinite opposition and there is no current. However, this 
sharp division between no opposition and full opposition is impossible to attain. A more practical graph 
of the current is shown in view (B), where the filter gradually builds up opposition as the cutoff frequency 
(f) is approached. Notice that the filter cannot completely block current above the cutoff frequency.
