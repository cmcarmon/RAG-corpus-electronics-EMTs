Power can be generated from a tidal estuary in two basic ways. A single basin can be used with a barrage at
a strategic point along the estuary. By installing turbines at this point, electricity can be generated both when
the tide is ebbing or ï¬‚ooding. In the two-basin scheme, generation can be time-shifted to coincide with hours
of peak demand by using the basins alternately.
