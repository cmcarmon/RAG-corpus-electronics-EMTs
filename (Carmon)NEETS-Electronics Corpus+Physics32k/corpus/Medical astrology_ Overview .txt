Medical astrology posits the association of each sign of the zodiac with parts of the body, and was already mentioned by Marcus Manilius (1st century AD) in his epic poem (8000 verses) Astronomica. The signs of the zodiac were believed to preside over the parts of the body, covering the body from head (Aries) to toe (Pisces), as follows:
Aries – head, face, brain, eyes
Taurus – throat, neck, thyroid gland, vocal tract
Gemini – arms, lungs, shoulders, hands, nervous system, brain
Cancer – chest, breasts, stomach, alimentary canal
Leo – heart, chest, spine, spinal column, upper back
Virgo – digestive system, intestines, spleen, nervous system
Libra – kidneys, skin, lumbar region, buttocks
Scorpio – reproductive system, sexual organs, bowels, excretory system
Sagittarius – hips, thighs, liver, sciatic nerve
Capricorn – knees, joints, skeletal system
Aquarius – ankles, circulatory system
Pisces – feet, toes, lymphatic system, adipose tissue
The western astrology planets are also associated with certain portions and functions within the body:

Sun – heart, eyes, circulatory system, upper back, vitality
Moon – stomach, breasts, lymphatic system, digestive system, womb, glandular tissue
Mercury – nervous system, lungs, arms, hands, tongue, bowels
Venus – neck, kidneys, thymus gland, lips, chin, cheeks, palate, eustachian tubes
Mars – muscles, testicles, nose, sinews
Jupiter – liver, fat, adrenals, thighs, feet, sciatic nerves
Saturn – skin, hair, teeth, bones, joints, knees
Uranus – parathyroid gland, neural activity, aura
Neptune – pineal gland, psychic healing
Pluto – pancreas, metabolism, elimination
After examining an individual's natal chart, a medical astrologer may give advice to the client about the areas of the body in which they are most likely to experience trouble. For instance, an individual with the Sun, Moon, Ascendant, or many planets in the sign of Aries is presumed to have more headaches than other people because of the association of Aries with the head. A person with Taurus strong in the natal chart is predicted to have many sore throats and problems with the voice because of the Taurean association with that particular part of the body.
