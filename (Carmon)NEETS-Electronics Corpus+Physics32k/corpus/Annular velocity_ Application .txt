The annular velocity is one of two major variables in the process of cleaning solids (drill cuttings) from the wellbore. By maintaining the annular velocity at certain rates (speeds) in conjunction with the rheological properties of the drilling fluid, the wellbore is kept clean of the drill cuttings to prevent them from settling back down to the bottom and causing drilling problems.
The other major variable is the rheology of the drilling fluid. Rheology is sometimes thought of as viscosity to the uninitiated, though improperly. Viscosity (sometimes thought of as its thickness) is a very basic measurement of the fluids resistance to change in movement or flow. The viscosity of a fluid can be measured with a Marsh Funnel. Rheology is the study of viscosity and requires more precise and complicated procedures and equipment for its determination. For drilling fluid applications a rheometer is used.
