Let us assume for the moment that {en} is indeed stationary
white noise, so {sn} is a stationary random process. In light of
the difference equation 3.8, a natural way to estimate the
parameters of a signal believed to follow an AR(M) model is
to design an FIR ﬁlter that attempts to ‘‘predict’’ sn from its
past M values. Let us denote the estimated ﬁlter parameters by
{^aai}M
