Which end is up?
When you use a diode in a circuit, itâ€™s extremely important to orient the 
diode the right way (more about that in a minute). The stripe or other mark 
on the diode package corresponds to the line segment in the circuit symbol 
for a diode: Both indicate the cathode, or negative terminal, of the diode.
