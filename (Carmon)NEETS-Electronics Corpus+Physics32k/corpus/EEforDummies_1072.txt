Inspecting the joint
After soldering, you should inspect the joint visually to make sure it’s strong 
and conductive. The cooled solder joint should be shiny, not dull, and should 
be able to withstand a gentle tug from one side. If you soldered a lead to a cir-
cuit board, you should be able to see a fillet (volcano‐shaped raised area of  
solder) at the joint. If you see dull solder or jagged peaks, you know you 
have a cold solder joint. Cold joints are physically weaker than properly made 
joints, and they don’t conduct electricity as well.
