Topographical maps represent an efﬁcient format for displaying the extensive amount of data generated by
quantitative analysis. However, for reasons discussed above, the researcher and clinician must be cautious in
deriving spatial and functional conclusions from mapped data. Although the replicability of map conﬁgurations
across subjects or experimental conditions may represent a useful basis for experimental and diagnostic clas-
siﬁcation,  judgments  concerning  the  localization  of  cortical  generators  or  functional  localization  of  cerebral
activity are less certain and more controversial. Research continues on deﬁning models and validating assump-
tions that relate scalp potentials to cortical generators in an attempt to arrive at accurate mathematical solutions
that can be applied to mapping functions.
