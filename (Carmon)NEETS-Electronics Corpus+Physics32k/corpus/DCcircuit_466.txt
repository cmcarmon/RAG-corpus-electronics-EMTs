The Ô¨Årst principle to understand about parallel circuits is that the voltage is equal across
all components in the circuit. This is because there are only two sets of electrically common
points in a parallel circuit, and voltage measured between sets of common points must always
be the same at any given time. Therefore, in the above circuit, the voltage across R1 is equal
to the voltage across R2 which is equal to the voltage across R3 which is equal to the voltage
across the battery. This equality of voltages can be represented in another table for our starting
values:
