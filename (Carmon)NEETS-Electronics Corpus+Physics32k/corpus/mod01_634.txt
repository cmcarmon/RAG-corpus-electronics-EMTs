The major difference between an open in a parallel circuit and an open in a series circuit is that in the
parallel circuit the open would not necessarily disable the circuit. If the open condition occurs in a series
portion of the circuit, there will be no current because there is no complete path for current flow. If, on the
other hand, the open occurs in a parallel path, some current will still flow in the circuit. The parallel
branch where the open occurs will be effectively disabled, total resistance of the circuit will INCREASE,
and total current will DECREASE.
