The system anatomy, unlike its siblings (project anatomy, integration anatomy), is actually just another view of the system, different from product structures, UML-models and flow charts. By focusing on the system’s capabilities – both internal and money making ones – and the dependencies between those, the development team gets a common picture of the system to be developed, that is easier to grasp than many other models. One of the key features of the system anatomy is its simplicity. That, of course, means that the anatomy cannot replace other models or design tools. It is only another way of describing the design, in SW tools, on paper or in the heads of the system engineers. The system anatomy can be used as a starting point when creating an integration anatomy (aka project anatomy) that has more use as a project management tool.
