which shows that the circuit in Fig. 6.35(b) provides an output voltage
proportional  to  the  integral  of  the  input.  In  practice,  the  op  amp  inte-
grator requires a feedback resistor to reduce dc gain and prevent satu-
ration.  Care  must  be  taken  that  the  op  amp  operates  within  the  linear
range so that it does not saturate.
