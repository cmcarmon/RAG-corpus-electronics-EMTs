This chapter will discuss systems containing a single storage element, namely,
a single capacitor or a single inductor. Such systems are described by simple,
first-order differential equations. Chapter 12 will discuss systems containing
two storage elements. Systems with two storage elements are described by
second-order differential equations.1 Higher-order systems are also possible,
and are discussed briefly in Chapter 12.
