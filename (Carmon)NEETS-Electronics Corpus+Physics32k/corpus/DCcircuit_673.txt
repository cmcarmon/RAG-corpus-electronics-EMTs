The ﬁve-position switch makes contact with only one resistor at a time. In the bottom (full
clockwise) position, it makes contact with no resistor at all, providing an ”off” setting. Each
resistor is sized to provide a particular full-scale range for the voltmeter, all based on the
particular rating of the meter movement (1 mA, 500 Ω). The end result is a voltmeter with
four different full-scale ranges of measurement. Of course, in order to make this work sensibly,
the meter movement’s scale must be equipped with labels appropriate for each range.
