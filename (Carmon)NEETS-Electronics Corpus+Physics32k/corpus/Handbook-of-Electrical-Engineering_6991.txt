4. Papoulis’ generalization.  Shannon  noted  that  a  bandlimited  signal  could  be  restored  when  sampling
was performed at half the Nyquist rate if, at every sample location, a sample of the signal’s derivative
were  also  taken.  Recurrent  nonuniform  sampling  is  where  P  samples  are  spaced  the  same  in  every  P
Nyquist intervals. Another sampling scenario is when a signal and its Hilbert transform are both sampled
at half their respective Nyquist rates. Restoration of the signal from these and numerous other sampling
scenarios are subsumed in an eloquent generalization of the sampling theorem by Papoulis.
