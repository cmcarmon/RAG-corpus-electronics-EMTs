When a color television signal is converted from analog to digital (A/D), the luminance, hue, and saturation
signals must each be digitized using 8 bits of A/D per sample. Digital transmission of conventional television
therefore requires a nominal bit rate of about 216 megabits/s, while uncompressed HDTV nominally requires
about 1200 megabits/s. If we were to use a digital modulation system that transmits 1 bit per hertz of bandwidth,
we see that the HDTV signal requires over 1 GHz of bandwidth, yet only 6 MHz is allocated. Clearly signiÔ¨Åcant
data compression is required!
