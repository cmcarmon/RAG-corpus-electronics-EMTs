The elementary charge, usually denoted as e or sometimes q, is the electric charge carried by a single proton, or equivalently, the magnitude of the electric charge carried by a single electron, which has charge −e. This elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant. To avoid confusion over its sign, e is sometimes called the elementary positive charge. This charge has a measured value of approximately 1.6021766208(98)×10−19 coulombs, and after the planned redefinition of SI base units in 2018-2019, its value will be exactly 1.602176634×10−19C by definition of the Coulomb. In cgs units, it is 4.80320425(10)×10−10 statcoulombs.
The magnitude of the elementary charge was first measured in Robert A. Millikan's noted oil drop experiment in 1909.
