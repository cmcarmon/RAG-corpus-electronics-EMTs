Inasmuch as the K shell can contain no more than 2 electrons, it must have only one subshell, the s
subshell. The M shell is composed of three subshells: s, p, and d. If the electrons in the s, p, and d
subshells are added together, their total is found to be 18, the exact number required to fill the M shell.
Notice the electron configuration of copper illustrated in figure 1-4. The copper atom contains 29
electrons, which completely fill the first three shells and subshells, leaving one electron in the "s" subshell
of the N shell. A list of all the other known elements, with the number of electrons in each atom, is
contained in the PERIODIC TABLE OF ELEMENTS. The periodic table of elements is included in
appendix 2.
