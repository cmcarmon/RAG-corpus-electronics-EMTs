Controlling the voltage gain
With the transistor in Figure 10-7 partially on, fluctuations in the base current 
caused by the AC input signal get amplified by the transistor. Because the 
current gain, hFE, of any transistor you happen to choose can be somewhat 
variable (schizophrenic, in fact), you design your amplifier circuit to elimi-
nate any dependency on the flaky current gain. You’ll give up some strength 
of amplification, but you’ll get stability and predictability in return.
