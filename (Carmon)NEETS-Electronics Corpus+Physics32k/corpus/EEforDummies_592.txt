▶✓ Construction of logic gates: Diodes are the building blocks of special­
ized circuits known as logic circuits, which process signals consisting 
solely of two voltage levels that are used to represent binary information 
(such as on/off, high/low, or 1/0) in digital systems. I discuss logic a bit 
more in Chapter 11.
