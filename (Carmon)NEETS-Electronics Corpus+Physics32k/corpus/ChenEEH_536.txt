Generation of electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor can be
achieved by illuminating a semiconductor sample with light
with photon energies larger than the energy gap of the semi-
conductor. The light is partially reï¬‚ected from the semicon-
ductor surface and partially absorbed in the semiconductor
(see Figure 6.12).
