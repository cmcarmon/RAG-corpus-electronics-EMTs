If you select too small a range, a digital multimeter typically displays an over-
range indicator (for instance, a flashing 1 or OL or OF), whereas the needle on 
an analog meter shoots off the scale, possibly damaging the precision needle 
movement (so make sure you start with a large range and dial it down, if nec-
essary). If you see an overrange indicator when testing continuity, it means 
the resistance is so high that the meter can’t register it; it’s fairly safe to 
assume that’s an open circuit.
