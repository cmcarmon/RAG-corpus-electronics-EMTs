ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS affect the speed and direction of travel of electromagnetic
wavefronts traveling through the air. Under normal conditions, the wavefronts increase uniformly in
speed as altitude increases which causes the travel path to curve downward. The downward curve extends
the radar horizon as shown in the illustration. The density of the atmosphere, the presence of water vapor,
and temperature changes also directly affect the travel of electromagnetic wavefronts.
