It had been thought that the invisible axion solves the strong CP problem without being amenable to verification by experiment. Axion models choose coupling that does not appear in any of the prior experiments. The very weakly coupled axion is also very light because axion couplings and mass are proportional. The situation changed when it was shown that a very light axion is overproduced in the early universe and therefore excluded. The critical mass is of order 10−11 times the electron mass, where axions may account for the dark matter. The axion is thus a dark-matter candidate, as well as a solution to the strong CP problem. Furthermore, in 1983, Pierre Sikivie wrote down the modification of Maxwell's equations from a light stable axion and showed that axions can be detected on Earth by converting them to photons, using a strong magnetic field, the principle of the ADMX. Solar axions may be converted to x-rays, as in CAST. Many experiments are searching laser light for signs of axions.
A mass value between 50 and 1,500 µeV for axion was reported in a paper published in November 2016 (Borsanyi, S. et al.). The result was calculated by simulating the formation of axion during the post-inflation period on supercomputer.
