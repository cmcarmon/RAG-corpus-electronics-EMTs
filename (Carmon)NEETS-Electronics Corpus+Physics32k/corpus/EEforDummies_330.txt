When you have a good handle on Ohm’s Law, you’ll be ready to put it into 
practice. Ohm’s Law is like a master key, unlocking the secrets to electronic 
circuits. Use it to understand circuit behavior and to track down problems 
within a circuit (for instance, why the light isn’t shining, the buzzer isn’t 
buzzing, or the resistor isn’t resisting because it melted). You can also use it 
to design circuits and choose the right parts for use in your circuits. I get to 
these topics in a later section of this chapter. In this section, I discuss how to 
apply Ohm’s Law to analyze circuits.
