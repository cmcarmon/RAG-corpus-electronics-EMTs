The dynamic power dissipation equation is derived usually
by assuming that the inputs have zero rise and fall times,
or, in other words, that the NMOS and PMOS devices are
never on simultaneously. But in reality, such assumption is
not valid, and input signals have nonzero rise and fall times;
hence, a direct current path exists between Vdd and GND
for a short period of time during input switching, in which
case the PMOS and the NMOS devices are simultaneously
conducting. This power component is consumed without
attributing to the circuit behavior; thus,
it is considered
redundant.
