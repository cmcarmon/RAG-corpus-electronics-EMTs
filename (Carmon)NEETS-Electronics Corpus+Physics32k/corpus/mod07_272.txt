The CONDUCTION BAND is a band in which the energy level of the electrons is high enough that 
the electrons will move easily under the influence of an external field. Since current flow is the movement 
of electrons, the readily mobile electrons in the conduction band are capable of maintaining a current flow 
when an external field in the form of a voltage is applied. Therefore, solid materials that have many 
electrons in the conduction band are called conductors.
