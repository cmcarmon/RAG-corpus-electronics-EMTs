4.2.14 A three-phase balanced load draws 100 kW at
0.8 power factor lagging. In order to improve the
supply power factor to 0.95 leading, a synchronous
motor drawing 50 kW is connected in parallel with
the load. Compute the kVAR, kVA, and the power
factor of the motor (specify whether lagging or
leading).
