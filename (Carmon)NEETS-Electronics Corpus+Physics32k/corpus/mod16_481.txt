As you studied in chapter 3 (externally excited meters), placing a meter into a circuit causes energy
to be taken from the circuit. The amount of energy taken depends on the sensitivity of the meter. In some
cases, this energy loss cannot be tolerated. For example, in extremely sensitive circuits, such as oscillator
grid circuits and automatic volume control circuits, degradation of normal circuit operation will occur.
This often results in failure to obtain a usable indication of the fault. The use of electronic multimeters is
practical in these sensitive electronic circuits. The higher the input impedance of a meter, the less the
loading effect and the more accurate the measurements taken. Electronic multimeters have considerably
greater input impedances than do nonelectronic multimeters.
