This is just one of the ways that a meter can become a source of hazard if used improperly.
Voltage measurement is perhaps the most common function a multimeter is used for. It
is certainly the primary measurement taken for safety purposes (part of the lock-out/tag-out
procedure), and it should be well understood by the operator of the meter. Being that voltage
is always relative between two points, the meter must be ﬁrmly connected to two points in a
circuit before it will provide a reliable measurement. That usually means both probes must be
grasped by the user’s hands and held against the proper contact points of a voltage source or
circuit while measuring.
