These trans-Neptunian objects are theoretically large enough to be dwarf planets. Dozens more could have been included. Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined. Both are more massive than the 5Ã—1020 kg recommendation of the IAU 2006 draft proposal as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet.
