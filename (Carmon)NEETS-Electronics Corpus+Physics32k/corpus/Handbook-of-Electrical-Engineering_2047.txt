teleconferencing eventually will demand larger audio bandwidths (e.g., 7 kHz) compared to standard telephone
connections (about 3.2 kHz). Finally, we note that echo cancellation in a stereo setup (two microphones and
two loudspeakers at each end) is an even harder problem on which very little work has been done so far.
