and no signiﬁcant nonlinearities in the controlled element, the basic cause appears to be random time-varying
behavior within the operator, which can be thought of as continuous random ﬂuctuations in the effective time
delay. The remnant can be described as a continuous, relatively broadband, power spectral density. Fig. 105.4
provides a cross-section of remnant data from several sources. It is very important to note that the magnitude
of the power spectral density scales approximately with the mean-squared error.
