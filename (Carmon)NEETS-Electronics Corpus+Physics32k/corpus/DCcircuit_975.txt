- I4R4 + EB2 - I5R5 = 0
I suppose if you have nothing better to do with your time than to solve for ﬁve unknown
variables with ﬁve equations, you might not mind using the Branch Current method of analysis
for this circuit. For those of us who have better things to do with our time, the Mesh Current
method is a whole lot easier, requiring only three unknowns and three equations to solve:
