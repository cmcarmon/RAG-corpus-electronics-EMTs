An ideal pulsed radar signal is made up of a train of rf pulses with a constant repetition rate, constant 
pulse width and shape, and constant amplitude. To receive the energy reflected from a target, the radar 
receiver requires almost ideal pulse radar emission characteristics. By observing the spectra of a pulsed 
radar signal, you can easily and accurately measure such characteristics as pulse width, duty cycle, and
