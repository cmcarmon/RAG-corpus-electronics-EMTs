Say you poke one lead of a resistor into hole b5 in the breadboard in Figure 2-8.  
You’re connecting that lead to the underlying metal strip that connects 
the five holes in column 5, rows a through e. By plugging, say, one lead of a 
capacitor into hole d5, you make a connection between the resistor and the 
capacitor because holes b5 and d5 are electrically connected. You can build 
a working circuit — without permanently bonding components — by plug-
ging in components to make the connections you need, and then running 
wires from your breadboard to your power supply (say, a 9‐volt battery).
