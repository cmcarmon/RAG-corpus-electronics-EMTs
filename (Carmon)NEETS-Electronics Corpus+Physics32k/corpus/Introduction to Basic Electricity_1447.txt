Figure 11-6 lists some commonly used powers 
of 10, both positive and negative, and the prefixes 
and symbols associated with them. For example, 
an  ampere (A) is a large unit of current that is not 
 often found in low-power electronic circuits. More 
 frequently used units are the milliampere	(ma) and 
the micro	ampere	(ma). A milliampere is equal to 
one- thousandth (1/1000) of an ampere, or 0.001 A. 
In other words, it takes 1000 milliamperes to equal 
one ampere. A  microampere is equal to one-millionth
