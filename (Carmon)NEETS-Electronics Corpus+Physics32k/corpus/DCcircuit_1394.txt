Interference: Inductors may affect nearby components on a circuit board with their magnetic
ﬁelds, which can extend signiﬁcant distances beyond the inductor. This is especially true if
there are other inductors nearby on the circuit board. If the magnetic ﬁelds of two or more
inductors are able to ”link” with each others’ turns of wire, there will be mutual inductance
present in the circuit as well as self-inductance, which could very well cause unwanted effects.
This is another reason why circuit designers tend to choose capacitors over inductors to perform
similar tasks: capacitors inherently contain their respective electric ﬁelds neatly within the
component package and therefore do not typically generate any ”mutual” effects with other
components.
