*4.3.5 Referring to Problem 4.2.15(b), with a phase volt-
age as the reference phasor and with a positive-
phase-sequence supply system, two single-phase
wattmeters are used to measure the power deliv-
ered to the load. The wattmeter current coils are
arranged as in Figure 4.3.1 to carry the currents IA
and IC, whereas the potential coils share a common
connection at the node B. Determine the readings
of the two wattmeters WA and WC, and verify that
the sum of these readings equals the total power
in the load.
