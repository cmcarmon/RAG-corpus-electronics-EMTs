It  is  interesting  to  note  that  relationships  (14.120)  and  (14.122)  which  identify  the  closest  approximating
Toeplitz and Hankel matrices are very much dependent on the Frobenius measure of matrix size. If a different
metric had been incorporated, then different expressions for the best approximating Toeplitz and Hankel matrix
approximations  would  have  arisen.  For  example,  in  applications  in  which  data  outliers  are  anticipated,  it  is
often beneﬁcial to use the l1-induced norm. In this case, the elements ak and bk are replaced by the median
value  of  the  kth  diagonal  and  antidiagonal  of  matrix A,  respectively.  Similarly,  if  the  l¥-induced  norm  were
used, the elements ak and bk would be replaced by the midpoint of the largest and smallest elements of the kth
diagonal and the k th antidiagonal of matrix A, respectively.
