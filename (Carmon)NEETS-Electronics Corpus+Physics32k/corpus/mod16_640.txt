In the basic oscilloscope, the sweep generator runs continuously (FREE-RUNNING); in more
elaborate oscilloscopes, it is normally turned off. In the oscilloscope weâ€™re using as an example, the sweep
generator can be triggered by the input signal or by a signal from some other source. (Triggering will be
discussed later in this chapter.) This type of oscilloscope is called a triggered oscilloscope. The triggered
oscilloscope permits more accurate time measurements to be made and provides a more stable
presentation than the nontriggered-type oscilloscope.
