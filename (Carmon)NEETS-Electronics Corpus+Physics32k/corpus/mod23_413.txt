Most hard disk failures involve a head-crash. It's the worst thing that can happen to a hard disk. A 
head-crash is the result of the disk drive's magnetic heads crashing into the recording surface and 
grinding into the hard disk platter. Figure 8-6 shows a good hard disk platter and a bad hard disk platter 
that was the victim of a head-crash.
