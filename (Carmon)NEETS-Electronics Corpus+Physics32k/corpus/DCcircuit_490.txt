When using Ohm’s Law to calculate a variable pertaining to a single component, be sure
the voltage you’re referencing is solely across that single component and the current you’re
referencing is solely through that single component and the resistance you’re referencing is
solely for that single component. Likewise, when calculating a variable pertaining to a set of
components in a circuit, be sure that the voltage, current, and resistance values are speciﬁc to
that complete set of components only! A good way to remember this is to pay close attention
to the two points terminating the component or set of components being analyzed, making
sure that the voltage in question is across those two points, that the current in question is
the electron ﬂow from one of those points all the way to the other point, that the resistance in
question is the equivalent of a single resistor between those two points, and that the power in
question is the total power dissipated by all components between those two points.
