When you have a capacitive reactance to deal with instead of inductive reactance as in the previous 
example, it is customary to draw the line representing the capacitive reactance in a downward direction. 
This is shown in figure 4-6. The line is drawn downward for capacitive reactance to indicate that it acts in 
a direction opposite to inductive reactance which is drawn upward. In a series circuit containing 
capacitive reactance the equation for finding the impedance becomes:
