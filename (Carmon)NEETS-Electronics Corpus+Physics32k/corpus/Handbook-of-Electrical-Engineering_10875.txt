In MATRIXx, this problem was avoided by using packing techniques and a special data-structure so that,
for example, the state-space model in Fig. 112.3, would have been stored as shown in Fig. 112.8 and additional
data would be stored in the workspace of the program so that the A, B, C, D matrices could be later extracted
when needed.
