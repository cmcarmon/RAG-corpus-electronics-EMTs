In the low-drain-bias regime, the drain current increases
almost linearly with drain bias. Indeed, here the channel
resembles an ideal resistor obeying Ohm’s law. The channel
resistance is determined by the electron concentration in
the channel, which is a function of the gate bias. Therefore,
the channel acts like a voltage-controlled resistor whose
resistance is determined by the applied gate bias. As
shown in Figure 3.9, as the gate bias is increased,
the
slope of the I–V characteristic gradually increases due to
the increasing conductivity of the channel. We obtain dif-
ferent slopes for different gate biases. This region where the
channel behaves like a resistor is referred to as the linear
region of operation. The drain current in the linear regime
is given by:
