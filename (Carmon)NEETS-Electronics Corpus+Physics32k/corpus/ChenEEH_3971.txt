Since the introduction of the temporal hyperplane by Lam-
port (1974), the scheduling and assignment problem of nested
Do-loop algorithms has been explored and developed to the
so-called systolic array (Kung, 1982), exploiting regular array
structure,
temporal pipelining, and local communication.
Along with the advance of VLSI technology, certain nested
Do-loop algorithms can be scaled down and realizable in a
single chip. Thus, the nested Do-loop scheduling and assign-
ment problem can be formulated as an algebraic projection.
Each loop index in the index space will be projected onto the
index of a regular array of processing elements (PEs), and their
execution time is determined by a family of equitemporal
hyperplanes, where all indices on the same hyperplane are
executed simultaneously.
