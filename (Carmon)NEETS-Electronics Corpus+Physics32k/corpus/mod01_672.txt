In actual practice the computed value of the bleeder resistor does not always come out to an even
value. Since the rule-of-thumb for bleeder current is only an estimated value, the bleeder resistor can be
of a value close to the computed value. (If the computed value of the resistance were 510 ohms, a 500-
ohm resistor could be used.) Once the actual value of the bleeder resistor is selected, the bleeder current
must be recomputed. The voltage developed by the bleeder resistor must be equal to the voltage
requirement of the load in parallel with the bleeder resistor.
