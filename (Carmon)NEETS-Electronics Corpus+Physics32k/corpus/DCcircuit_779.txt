In the switchâ€™s three lower (most counter-clockwise) positions, the meter movement is con-
nected to the Common and V jacks through one of three different series range resistors
(Rmultiplier1 through Rmultiplier3), and so acts as a voltmeter. In the fourth position, the me-
ter movement is connected in parallel with the shunt resistor, and so acts as an ammeter for
any current entering the common jack and exiting the A jack. In the last (furthest clockwise)
position, the meter movement is disconnected from either red jack, but short-circuited through
