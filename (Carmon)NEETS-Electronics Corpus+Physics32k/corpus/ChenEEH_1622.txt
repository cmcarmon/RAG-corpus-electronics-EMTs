In MYCIN, the explanation module is invoked at the end of
every consultation. To explain the result, the module retrieves
the list of rules that were successfully applied, along with the
conclusions drawn. It allows the user to interrogate the system
about the conclusions. Inquiries generally fall into two types:
why a particular question was put and how a particular con-
clusion was reached. MYCIN keeps track of the goalâ€“subgoal
structure of the computation and uses it to answer a why
question by citing the related rules together with other condi-
tions. To answer a how question, MYCIN maintains a record of
the decisions it made and cites the rules that it applied as well
as the degree of certainty of the decision.
