When the probability that the event will not happen is greater than the probability that it will, then the odds are "against" that event happening. Odds of 6 to 1, for example, are therefore sometimes said to be "6 to 1 against". To a gambler, "odds against" means that the amount he or she will win is greater than the amount staked.
