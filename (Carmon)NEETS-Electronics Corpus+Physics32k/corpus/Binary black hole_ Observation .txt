The first observation of stellar mass binary black holes merging was performed by the LIGO detector. As measured from earth, a pair of black holes with estimated masses around 36 and 29 times that of the Sun spun into each other and merged to form a 62 solar mass black hole (approximate) on 14 September 2015, at 09:50 UTC. Three solar masses were converted to gravitational radiation in the final fraction of a second, with a peak power 3.6Ã—1056 ergs/second (200 solar masses per second), which is 50 times the total output power of all the stars in the observable universe. The merger took place at 1.3 billion light years from Earth. The observed signal is consistent with the predictions of numerical relativity.
