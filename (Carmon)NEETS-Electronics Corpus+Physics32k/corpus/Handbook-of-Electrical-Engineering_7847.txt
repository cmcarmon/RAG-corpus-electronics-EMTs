The  laser  used  for  readout  is  usually  the  same  as  that  used  for  recording,  but  its  output  power  level  is
substantially reduced in order to avoid erasing (or otherwise obliterating) the previously recorded information.
For instance, if the power of the write/erase beam is 20 mW, then for the read operation the beam is attenuated
to about 3 or 4 mW. The same objective lens that focuses the write beam is now used to focus the read beam,
creating a diffraction-limited spot for resolving the recorded marks. Whereas in writing the laser was pulsed
to selectively reverse-magnetize small regions along the track, in readout it operates with constant power, i.e.,
in CW mode. Both up- and down-magnetized regions are read as the track passes under the focused spot. The
reï¬‚ected beam, which is now polarization-modulated, goes back through the objective and becomes collimated
once again; its information content is subsequently decoded by polarization-sensitive optics, and the scanned
pattern of magnetization is reproduced as an electronic signal.
