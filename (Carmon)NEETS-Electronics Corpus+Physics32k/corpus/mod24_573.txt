Test personnel also use an optical power meter and stabilized light source to measure fiber
attenuation and transmission loss in the field. Optical power meter measurements are recommended when
the length of an installed optical fiber cable or cable plant is less than 50 meters. A test jumper is used to
couple light from the stabilized source to one end of the optical fiber (or cable plant) under test. An
additional test jumper is also used to connect the other end of the optical fiber (or cable plant) under test
to the power meter. Optical power meter measurements may be conducted using an optical loss test set
(OLTS). An OLTS combines the power meter and source functions into one physical unit. When making
measurements, it does not matter whether the stabilized source and power meter are in one physical unit
or two.
