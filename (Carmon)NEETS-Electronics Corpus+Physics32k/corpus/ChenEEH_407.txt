of the LC ladder, Gorski-Popiel’s method may save a consider-
able number of GICs, resulting in reduced cost, power con-
sumption, and noise. The simulation of the band-pass ladder
in Figure 4.12(A) provides an example for the efﬁciencies
afforded by Gorski-Popiel’s procedure. Converting each in-
ductor individually would require six GICs, whereas identify-
ing ﬁrst
four
inductors leads to only three GICs for the active simulation
of the ladder shown in Figure 4.12(B).
