The problem now is: at what voltage and polarity should the screen grid be operated? If the screen
grid were operated at a potential that would make it negative in relation to the control grid, it would act as
a negative screen between the plate and control grid. As a result, gain would be reduced. If the screen grid
were operated at plate potential, it would draw current from the electron stream when the tube conducts.
Because of this, the value of Rsg is normally selected to cause the screen grid to be positive in relation to
the control grid, but not as positive as the plate.
