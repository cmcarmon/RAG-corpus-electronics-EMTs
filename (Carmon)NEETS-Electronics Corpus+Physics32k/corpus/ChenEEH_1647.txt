it into a 1-D string of quantized coefﬁcients like in JPEG.
Finally, the side information for the macroblock, including
the type, block-pattern and motion vectors, and DCT coefﬁ-
cients are coded. A unique feature of the MPEG-1 standard is
the introduction of B-pictures that have access to both past
and future anchor points. They can either use past frame,
called forward motion estimation or the future frame, called
backward motion estimation, as shown in Figure 6.5.
