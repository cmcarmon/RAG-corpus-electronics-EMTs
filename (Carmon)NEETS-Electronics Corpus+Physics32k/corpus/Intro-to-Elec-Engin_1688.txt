The control of a dc motor can be achieved with a PI controller discretized for microprocessor
programming. The starting point is that the PI controller is described by a differential equation.
The latter is discretized at the sampling instants by one of the numerical approximation methods,
and then is programmed in the microprocessor machine language.
