A device that is much more convenient for providing gain (and other useful features as well) than the
transistor is the operational ampliﬁer, also known as the op-amp. An op-amp is an integrated circuit (a
complicated circuit involving several transistors constructed on a chip) that provides a large voltage gain if
you attach the power supply. We can model the op-amp with a new circuit element: the dependent source.
3.18 Dependent Sources29
A dependent source is either a voltage or current source whose value is proportional to some other voltage
or current in the circuit. Thus, there are four diﬀerent kinds of dependent sources; to describe an op-amp, we
need a voltage-dependent voltage source. However, the standard circuit-theoretical model for a transistor30
contains a current-dependent current source. Dependent sources do not serve as inputs to a circuit like
independent sources. They are used to model active circuits: those containing electronic elements. The
RLC circuits we have been considering so far are known as passive circuits.
