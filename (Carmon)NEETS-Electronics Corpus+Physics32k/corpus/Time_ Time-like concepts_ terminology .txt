The term "time" is generally used for many close but different concepts, including:
instant as an object – one point on the time axes. Being an object, it has no value;
time interval as an object – part of the time axes limited by two instants. Being an object, it has no value;
date as a quantity characterising an instant. As a quantity, it has a value which may be expressed in a variety of ways, for example "2014-04-26T09:42:36,75" in ISO standard format, or more colloquially such as "today, 9:42 a.m.";
duration as a quantity characterizing a time interval. As a quantity, it has a value, such as a number of minutes, or may be described in terms of the quantities (such as times and dates) of its beginning and end.
