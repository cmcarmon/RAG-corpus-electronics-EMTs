In  the  particular  case  of  an  IE  model,  the  coefﬁcients  of  the  direct  or  original  matrix  are  the  mutual
impedances of the multiport representation which approximates the problem being modeled, and the coefﬁ-
cients  of  its  solution  matrix  (or  equivalent  thereof)  are  the  mutual  admittances.  Depending  on  whether  a
subdomain or entire-domain basis has been used (see Basic Function Selection), these impedances and admittances
represent either spatial or modal interactions among the N ports of the numerical model. In either case, these
