Periodic time, t 
 
This is the time (measured at the 50% amplitude 
points)  for  one  a  complete  cycle  of  a  repetitive 
pulse waveform. The periodic time is sometimes 
referred to as the period (see page 70). Note also 
that the pulse repetition frequency (p.r.f.) is the 
reciprocal of the periodic time. 
 
On time, ton 
This  is  the  time  for  which  the  pulse  amplitude 
exceeds  50%  of  its  amplitude.  The  on-time  is 
sometimes referred to as the high time.
