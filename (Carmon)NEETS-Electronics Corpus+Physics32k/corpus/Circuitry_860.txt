(v)   IEEE-488  connectors.  These  14,  24,  36 
and  50-way  connectors  are  commonly 
used  with  equipment  which  uses  the 
popular IEEE-488 instrument bus system. 
Note  that  insulation  displacement  connector 
(IDC)  provide  a  means  of  terminating  multi-
the  need  for 
soldering.  Simple  tools  are  used  to  assemble 
the  connector  and  strain  relief  clamp  onto  the 
cable, the insulation of which is pierced by the 
tines of the connector pins.)
