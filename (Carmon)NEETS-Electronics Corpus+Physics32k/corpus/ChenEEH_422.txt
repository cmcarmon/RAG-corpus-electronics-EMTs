Cascade Design
The only difference between this cascade design method and
the one presented earlier (in Section 4.2.1) is the use of only
OTAs and capacitors. In this case, the ﬁlter sections do not
normally have low output impedance, but the input impe-
dance4 is as a rule very large, so cascading remains possible.
General ﬁrst- and second-order sections are shown in Figure
4.17. The circuit in Figure 4.17(A) realizes the function:
