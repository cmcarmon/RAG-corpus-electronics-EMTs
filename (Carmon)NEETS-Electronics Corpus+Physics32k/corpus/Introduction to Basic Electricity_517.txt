It is important for all employees to know what 
 constitutes harassment. Hence, it is necessary to  instruct 
all employees and supervisors on what  behaviors are 
considered harassment. Most  employers have an es-
tablished procedure for filing any case  involving ha-
rassment in the workplace, and it is  important to make 
these procedures known to everyone.
