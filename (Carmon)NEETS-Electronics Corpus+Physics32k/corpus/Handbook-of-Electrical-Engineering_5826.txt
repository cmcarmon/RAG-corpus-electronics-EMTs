 and a sectionalizing
switch divide the main feeder into two parts. The normally open tie-switch connects the feeder to the adjacent
distribution substation. The fault between the CB and recloser opens the reclosing CB. The CB recloses after
a few cycles. If the fault is not cleared, the opening and reclosing process is repeated two times. If the fault has
not  been  cleared  before  the  third  reclosing,  the  CB  remains  open.  Then  the  sectionalizing  switch  opens  and
the tie-switch closes. This energizes the feeder between the recloser and the tie-switch from the neighboring
feeder.  Similarly,  the  fault  between  the  recloser  and  tie-switch  activates  the  recloser.  The  recloser  opens  and
recloses three times. If the fault is not cleared, the recloser remains open and separates the faulty part of the
