It should be clear from the preceding chapters that communication systems exist to perform a wide variety of
tasks. The demands placed on today’s communication systems necessitate higher data rates, greater ﬂexibility,
and increased reliability. Communication systems are therefore becoming increasingly complex, and the result-
ing systems cannot usually be analyzed using traditional (pencil and paper) analysis techniques. In addition,
communication systems often operate in complicated environments that are not analytically tractable. Examples
include  channels  that  exhibit  severe  bandlimiting,  multipath,  fading,  interference,  non-Gaussian  noise,  and
perhaps even burst noise. The combination of a complex system and a complex environment makes the design
and analysis of these communication systems a formidable task. Some level of computer assistance must usually
be  invoked  in  both  the  design  and  analysis  process.  The  appropriate  level  of  computer  assistance  can  range
from simply using numerical techniques to solve a differential equation deﬁning an element or subsystem to
developing a
