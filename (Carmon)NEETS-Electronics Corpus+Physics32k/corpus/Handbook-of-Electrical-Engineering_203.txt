esearchers at the U.S. Air Force’s Rome Laboratory and Johns Hopkins University have developed
an  all-plastic  battery  using  polymers  instead  of  conventional  electrode  materials.    All-plastic
power  cells  could  be  a  safer,  more  ﬂexible  substitute  for  use  in  electronic  devices  and  other
commercial applications.  In addition, all-polymer cells reduce toxic waste disposal, negate environmental
concerns, and can meet EPA and FAA requirements.
