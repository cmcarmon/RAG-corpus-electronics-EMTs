An  interesting  historical  perspective  on  the  development  of  LCD  technology  is  provided  by  the  extensive
reviews  of  150  patents  in  the  ﬁeld  contained  in Liquid  Crystal  Devices,  edited  by  T.  Kallard  (State  of  the Art
Review, Vol. 7, Optosonic Press, New York, 1973). The book also contains a bibliography of more than 1100 entries.
The  various  professional  societies’  magazines  are  excellent  sources  of  material  for  recent  developments  in
this ﬁeld (and others). These publications regularly devote a special issue to research developments in a single
ﬁeld, at a level intended for the non-specialist. A good example in the LCD area is provided by two articles on
TFT silicon for active matrix displays contained in the Materials for Flat-Panel Displays issue of the MRS Bulletin,
21(3), March 1996 (Materials Research Society), which cover the transition from a-Si:H to polysilicon, to the
prospects for single crystals.
