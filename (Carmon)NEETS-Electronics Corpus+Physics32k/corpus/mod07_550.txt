Whenever you are working with electricity, the proper use of safety precautions is of the utmost 
importance to remember. In the front of all electronic technical manuals, you will always find a section on 
safety precautions. Also posted on each piece of equipment should be a sign listing the specific 
precautions for that equipment. One area that is sometimes overlooked, and is a hazard especially on 
board ship, is the method in which equipment is grounded. By grounding the return side of the power 
transformer to the metal chassis, the load being supplied by the power supply can be wired directly to the 
metal chassis. Thereby the necessity of wiring directly to the return side of the transformer is eliminated. 
This method saves wire and reduces the cost of building the equipment, and while it solves one of the 
problems of the manufacturer, it creates a problem for you, the technician. Unless the chassis is physically 
grounded to the ship's ground (the hull), the chassis can be charged (or can float) several hundred volts 
above ship's ground. If you come in contact with the metal chassis at the same time you are in contact 
with the ship's hull, the current from the chassis can use your body as a low resistance path back to the 
ship's ac generators. At best this can be an unpleasant experience; at worst it can be fatal. For this reason 
Navy electronic equipment is always grounded to the ship's hull, and approved rubber mats are required
