  3.  A component’s lead may be identified with letter 
symbols. For example, SCR leads are identified as 
K (cathode), A (anode), and G (gate). Transistor 
leads are identified as E (emitter), B (base), and  
C (collector).
Figure 5-11 shows two schematic symbols for 
ground. The most commonly used symbol is shown 
in Figure 5-11A. It represents chassis or earth ground, 
may be used multiple times in the same schematic 
diagram, and represents a common return point for 
a circuit. The ground symbol shown in Figure 5-11B 
represents chassis–ground only. If the schematic draw-
ing uses this symbol, it is connected to the ground 
prong of an AC line cord, and the chassis will be at 
earth ground potential.
