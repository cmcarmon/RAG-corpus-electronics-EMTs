When re-drawing the circuit for series/parallel analysis with one source, all other voltage
sources are replaced by wires (shorts), and all current sources with open circuits (breaks).
Since we only have voltage sources (batteries) in our example circuit, we will replace every
inactive source during analysis with a wire.
