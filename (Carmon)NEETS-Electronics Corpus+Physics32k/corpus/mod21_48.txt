Voltages are usually measured by placing the measuring device in parallel with the component or
circuit (load) to be measured. The measuring device should have an infinite internal resistance (input
impedance) so that it will absorb no energy from the circuit under test and, therefore, measure the true
voltage. The accuracy of the voltage measurement depends on the total resistance of the measuring device
compared to the load being measured. When the input impedance of the measuring device is 10 times
greater than the load being measured, the error usually can be tolerated. If this error cannot be tolerated, a
high input impedance measuring device, such as a vacuum tube voltmeter (vtvm), should be used.
Alternatively, using two voltmeters in series increases the voltage range and, because of the increase in
total voltmeter resistance, provides a more accurate measurement of voltage across the load. If the voltage
to be measured is sufficiently high, more than two similar voltmeters can be connected in series across the
load to provide greater accuracy; the total voltage measurement is the sum of the individual meter
indications.
