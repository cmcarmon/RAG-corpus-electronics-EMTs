Mixed potential theory is a theory used in electrochemistry that relates the potentials and currents from differing constituents to come up with a 'weighted' potential at zero net current. In other words, it is an electrode potential resulting from a simultaneous action of more than a single redox couple, while the net electrode current is zero.
