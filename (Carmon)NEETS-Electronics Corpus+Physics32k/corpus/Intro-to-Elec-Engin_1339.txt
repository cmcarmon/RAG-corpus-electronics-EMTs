In general, any physical resistor or lossy device can be modeled by a noise source in series
with a noiseless resistor, as shown in Figure 14.3.4. The noise source is usually characterized as a
sample function of a random process. Since random processes involving probability and random
variables are outside the scope of this text, we will resort to simpler explanations. Figure 14.3.5
