When you use an analog multimeter to perform resistance measurements, the first thing you do is
zero the meter. The meter indication varies greatly depending on the resistance of the test leads, the
condition of the batteries within the meter, and the resistance range selected on the multimeter. The meter
should be zeroed every time you change range settings. To zero a multimeter you short the leads together
and adjust the meter for a full-scale deflection. Scale markings are spaced closer together toward the
infinity point on the meter; therefore, more accurate readings are obtained near center scale. You should
select a range setting that will give you a mid-scale indication.
