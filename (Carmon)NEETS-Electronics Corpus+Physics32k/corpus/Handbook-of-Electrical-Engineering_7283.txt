A  problem  with  AMPS  is  the  occupation  of  an  entire  30-kHz  channel  by  a  single  user.  This  affected  the
overall capacity of AMPS systems. Another problem is the lack of privacy in AMPS, which has led to a serious
problem of phone cloning. In addition, the performance of analog FM in the mobile channel suffers from the
threshold effect, where signal quality degrades rapidly once received signal levels fall below a threshold value.
Digital technologies take advantage of coding and modulation to increase signal quality when received signal
levels are low. Moreover, digital technologies employ encryption, which addresses to a certain extent the problem
of cloning phones. As a result, digital wireless systems were developed for use in the cellular band to address
some of the problems with AMPS. A summary of the AMPS radio interface is given in Table 75.6.
