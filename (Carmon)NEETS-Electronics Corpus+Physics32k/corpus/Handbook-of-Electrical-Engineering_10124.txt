The above conﬁgurations are restricted to a single manipulator arm. There are tasks that are either difﬁcult
or impossible to perform with a single arm. With this realization, there has been signiﬁcant interest in the use
of multiple arms to perform coordinated tasks [Bonitz and Hsia, 1996]. Possible applications include carrying
loads that exceed the capacity of a single robot, and assembling objects without special ﬁxturing. Multiple arms
are particularly useful in zero-gravity environments. While there are signiﬁcant advantages to the use of multiple
robots, the complexity, in terms of kinematics, dynamics, and control, is quite high. However, the use of multiple
robots is opening new areas of application for robots.
