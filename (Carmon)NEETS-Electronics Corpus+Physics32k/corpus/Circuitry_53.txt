Magnetic circuits 
 
Materials 
steel  possess 
considerably enhanced  magnetic properties. Hence 
they  are  employed  in  applications  where  it  is 
necessary to increase the flux density produced by 
an  electric  current.  In  effect,  magnetic  materials 
allow  us  to  channel  the  electric  flux  into  a 
‘magnetic circuit’, as shown in Fig. 1.14. 
In  the  circuit  of  Fig.  1.14(b)  the  reluctance  of 
 
the  magnetic  core  is  analogous  to  the  resistance 
present in the electric circuit shown in Fig. 1.14(a). 
We  can  make  the  following  comparisons  between 
the two types of circuit (see Table 1.7). 
 
In practice, not all of the magnetic flux produced 
in  a  magnetic  circuit  will  be  concentrated  within 
the core and some ‘leakage flux’ will appear in the 
surrounding  free  space  (as  shown  in  Fig.  1.15). 
Similarly,  if  a  gap  appears  within  the  magnetic 
circuit, the flux will tend to spread out as shown in 
Fig. 1.16. This effect is known as ‘fringing’.
