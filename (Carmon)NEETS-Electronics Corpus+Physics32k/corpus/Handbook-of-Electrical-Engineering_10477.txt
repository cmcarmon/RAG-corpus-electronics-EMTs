An even higher level of control is possible. When complete familiarity with the controlled element dynamics
and the entire perceptual Ô¨Åeld is achieved, the highly skilled human operator can, under certain conditions,
generate  neuromuscular  commands  which  are  deft,  discrete,  properly  timed,  scaled,  and  sequenced  so  as  to
result in machine outputs which are almost exactly as desired. These neuromuscular commands are selected
