However, if the ground conductor is present and properly connected to the chassis of the appliance,
as shown in Figure 4.4.4(b), the metal case will remain at ground potential or, at worst, a few
volts from ground if a fault results in current through the ground wire. The “hot” conductor may
be shorted to ground under fault conditions, in which case the circuit breaker would operate.
