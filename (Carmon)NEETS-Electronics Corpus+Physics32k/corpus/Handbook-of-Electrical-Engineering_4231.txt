Search operations impose additional losses due to target position uncertainty. Because the target position is
unknown before detection, the beam, range gate, and Doppler Ô¨Ålter will not be centered on the target return.
Hence, straddling loss will occur as the target effectively straddles adjacent resolution cells in range and Doppler.
Beamshape loss is a consequence of the radar beam not being pointed directly at the target so that there is a
loss  in  both  transmit  and  receive  antenna  gain.  In  addition,  detection  threshold  loss  associated  with  radar
system adaptation to interference must be included [Nathanson, 1991]).
