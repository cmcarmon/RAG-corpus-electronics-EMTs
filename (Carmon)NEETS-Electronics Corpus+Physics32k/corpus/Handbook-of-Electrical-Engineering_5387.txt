Background
The ﬁrst reference to the concept of TPV appeared in 1961 and attributes the original idea to Professor Pierre
Agrain [1]. In a series of lectures at MIT in the early 1960s, Agrain assumed that radiation from the emitter
that is not useful for conversion in the photocell could be returned to the emitter. Photocells were available in
several  materials  systems,  but  only  silicon  had  reached  conversion  efﬁciencies  of  a  level  for  consideration  in
power conversion. Silicon’s limited utilization of the emission spectrum from early systems was addressed in
