In variable-shaft-speed operation, the turbine is allowed to rotate at different speeds with
the varying wind speed. Optimum power transfer is possible, while the actual speed of rotation
is determined by the torqueâ€“speed characteristics of both the turbine and the generator. In such
an operating mode, major control means are inevitably placed on the electrical side, since the
control of electric systems is easy to implement, more reliable, and less costly than the control of
mechanical systems.
