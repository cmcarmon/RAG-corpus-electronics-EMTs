A Controlled shunt reactor (CSR) is a variable inductance, smoothly regulated by magnetic biasing of ferromagnetic elements of magnetic circuit. The magnetic system of a CSR single phase consists of two cores. Each core is equipped with control and power windings. In case of regulated DC voltage source connection to the control windings, biasing flow is increasing and directed to different sides in the adjacent cores. This resulted in saturation of CSR cores at relevant half-period of the current. Core saturation is resulted in initiation and increase of the current in the power winding due to non-linear characteristics of the magnetic core. Change in biasing current value leads to the power winding current change, due to which a stepless variation of voltage levels in CSR connection point as well as the value of reactive power consumed by the reactor is ensured.
