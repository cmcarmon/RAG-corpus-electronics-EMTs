Dynamic Response of Control Systems
The existence of transients (and associated oscillations) is a characteristic of systems that possess
energy-storage elements and that are subjected to disturbances. Usually the complete solution of
the differential equation provides maximum information about the system’s dynamic performance.
Consequently, whenever it is convenient, an attempt is made to establish this solution ﬁrst.
Unfortunately, however, this is not easily accomplished for high-order systems. Hence we are
forced to seek out other easier and more direct methods, such as the frequency-response method
of analysis.
