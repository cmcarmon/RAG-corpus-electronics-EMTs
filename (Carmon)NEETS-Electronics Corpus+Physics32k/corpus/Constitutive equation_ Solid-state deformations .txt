Several classes of deformations in elastic materials are the following:
Elastic: The material recovers its initial shape after deformation.
Anelastic: if the material is close to elastic, but the applied force induces additional time-dependent resistive forces (i.e. depend on rate of change of extension/compression, in addition to the extension/compression). Metals and ceramics have this characteristic, but it is usually negligible, although not so much when heating due to friction occurs (such as vibrations or shear stresses in machines).
Viscoelastic: If the time-dependent resistive contributions are large, and cannot be neglected. Rubbers and plastics have this property, and certainly do not satisfy Hooke's law. In fact, elastic hysteresis occurs.
Plastic: The applied force induces non-recoverable deformations in the material when the stress (or elastic strain) reaches a critical magnitude, called the yield point.
Hyperelastic: The applied force induces displacements in the material following a strain energy density function.
