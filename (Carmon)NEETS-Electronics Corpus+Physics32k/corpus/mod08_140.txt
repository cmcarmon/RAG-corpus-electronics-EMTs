The second single-stage audio amplifier is shown in figure 1-24. This circuit is a class A, 
common-source, RC-coupled, FET, audio amplifier. C1 is a coupling capacitor which couples the input 
signal to the gate of Q1. R1 is used to develop the input signal for the gate of Q1. R2 is used to bias the 
source of Q1. C2 is used to decouple the signal developed by R2 (and keep it from affecting the source of 
Q1). R3 is the drain load for Q1 and develops the output signal. C3 couples the output signal to the next 
stage. VDD is the supply voltage for the drain of Q1. Since this is a common-source configuration, the 
input and output signals are 180ยบ out of phase.
