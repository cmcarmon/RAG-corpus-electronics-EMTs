HF AND VHF TRANSMITTERS.â€”Oscillators are too unstable for direct frequency control in 
very- and ultra-high frequency transmitters. Therefore, these transmitters have oscillators operating at 
comparatively low frequencies, sometimes as low as 1/100 of the output frequency. The oscillator 
frequency is raised to the required output frequency by passing it through one or more FREQUENCY 
MULTIPLIERS. Frequency multipliers are special rf power amplifiers which multiply the input 
frequency. In practice, the MULTIPLICATION FACTOR (number of times the input frequency is 
multiplied) is seldom larger than five in any one stage. The block diagram of a typical VHF transmitter, 
designed for continuous tuning between 256 and 288 megahertz, is shown in figure 1-31.
