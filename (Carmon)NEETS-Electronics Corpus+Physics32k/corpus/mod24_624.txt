The development of efficient semiconductor optical sources, along with low-loss optical fibers, led
to substantial improvements in fiber optic communications. Semiconductor optical sources have the
physical characteristics and performance properties necessary for successful implementations of fiber
optic systems. It is desirable that optical sources:
