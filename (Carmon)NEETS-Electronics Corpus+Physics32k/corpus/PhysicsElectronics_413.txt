Example: Assuming that the diodes in the circuit below are ideal, write expres-
sions for the voltage at points A and B.
Consider when the current ﬂows in the clockwise direction (ﬁgure 4.22). VA =
VB = V0 in the steady state because the charge just builds (it has nowhere to
“drain” to).
Consider when the current ﬂows in the anti-clockwise direction (ﬁgure 4.23).
VA = V0 cos ωt, since this is just the output terminal of the voltage source. VB =
V0 in the steady state, again since the charge cannot go anywhere.
Thus by superposition
