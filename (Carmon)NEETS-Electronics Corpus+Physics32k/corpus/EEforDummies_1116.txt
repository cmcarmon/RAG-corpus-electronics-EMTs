Choosing a style: analog  
or digital
Most multimeters today, including the one 
shown in Figure 16-1, are digital multimeters, 
which provide readouts on a digital (numeric) 
display. You may also find some older‚Äêstyle 
analog multimeters, which use a needle to point 
to a set of graduated scales. You can see an 
analog multimeter in Figure 16-4.
