The technical manual for the magnetic recorder you’re testing will tell you how to set up the test
equipment. It’ll tell you to set up the wave analyzer to measure a specific frequency. This frequency will
be one of the multiples (· 1, · 2, · 3, etc.) of the frequency the signal generator is outputting.
