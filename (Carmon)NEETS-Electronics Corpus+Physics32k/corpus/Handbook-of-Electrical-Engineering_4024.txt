Comparing these expressions shows that the minimum noise ﬁgure increases with frequency quadratically
for  bipolar  transistors  and  linearly  for  MESFETs.  Therefore,  as  operating  frequency  increases,  the  MESFET
demonstrates increasingly superior noise ﬁgure performance as compared to Si bipolar transistors.
