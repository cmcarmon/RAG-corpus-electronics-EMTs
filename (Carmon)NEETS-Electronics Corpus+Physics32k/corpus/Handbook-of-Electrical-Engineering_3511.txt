Figure  34.2  summarizes  the  historical  development  of  DA  technology.  DA  computer  programs  are  often
. DA efforts started in the early 1960s as academic research projects and captive
simply called 
industrial  programs;  these  efforts  focused  on  tools  for  physical  and  logical  design.  Follow-on  developments

extended logic simulation to more-detailed 
tion. Starting in the mid to late 1970s, new areas of test and synthesis emerged and vendors started offering
commercial DA products. Today, the electronic design automation (EDA) industry is an international business
with a well-established and expanding technical base [Trimberger, 1990]. EDA will be examined by presenting
an overview of the following areas:
