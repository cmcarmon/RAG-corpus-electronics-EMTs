The computers of the fourth generation are not easily distinguished from earlier generations, yet 
there are some striking and important differences. The manufacturing of integrated circuits has advanced 
to the point where thousands of circuits (active components) can be placed on a silicon wafer only a 
fraction of an inch in size (the computer on a chip). This has led to what is called large scale integration 
(LSI) and very large scale integration (VLSI). As a result of this technology, computers are significantly 
smaller in physical size and lower in cost. Yet they have retained large memory capacities and are ultra 
fast. Large mainframe computers are increasingly complex. Medium sized computers can perform the 
same tasks as large third generation computers. An entirely new breed of computers called 
microcomputers  (fig. 1-9) and minicomputers are small and inexpensive, and yet they provide a large 
amount of computing power.
