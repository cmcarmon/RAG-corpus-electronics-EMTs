Since both signals and data can be transmitted and received through cables (communications lines), 
we refer to them as input/output channels. And when we transmit data directly to a computer over long 
distances, it becomes necessary to add two other devices, one at each end of the communications line. 
These devices are called modems (fig. 4-13). The word modem is an acronym for modulator/ 
demodulator (combines first syllable of each word). A modem converts the digital signal produced by 
your terminal or the computer to an audio signal suitable for transmission over the communications line. 
The modem at the other end of the line converts the audio signal back to a digital signal before it is 
supplied to the computers or your terminal. If this conversion were not carried out, the digital signal 
would degenerate during transmission and become garbled.
