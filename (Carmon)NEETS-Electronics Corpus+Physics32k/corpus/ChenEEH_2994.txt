Operation of the detector is depicted in Figure 11.12. Note
that at higher input levels, violating small-signal requirement
conditions causes the device to saturate, and the three-
term expansion of current is no longer sufﬁcient to describe
the behavior of the detector. When two signals are present,
mixing occurs. This is most common in receivers, where the
ampliﬁcation is used to boost the signal at the intermediate
frequency, thus increasing the sensitivity over direct detection
schemes. With mixing, both an RF and a LO signal will be
present. Expression of the small-signal ac is shown in this
equation:
