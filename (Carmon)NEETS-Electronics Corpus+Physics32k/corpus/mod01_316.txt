The purpose of this chapter is to introduce and explain the basic theory and characteristics of 
batteries. The batteries which are discussed and illustrated have been selected as representative of many 
models and types which are used in the Navy today. No attempt has been made to cover every type of 
battery in use, however, after completing this chapter you will have a good working knowledge of the 
batteries which are in general use.
