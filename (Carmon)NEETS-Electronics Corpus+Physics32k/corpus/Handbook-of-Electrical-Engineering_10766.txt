The MTTF of the parallel system can be obtained by using Eq. (110.25) in (110.6). The results for the case
of components with identical hazards l are: (1.5/l), (1.833/l), and (2.083/l) for n = 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
The  largest  gain  in  MTTF  is  obtained  by  going  from  one  component  to  two  components  in  parallel.  It  is
uncommon to have more than two or three components in a truly parallel conÔ¨Åguration because of the cost
involved. For two non-identical components in parallel with hazard rates of l1 and l2, the MTTF is given as
