The ﬁgure of 9 volts is a total quantity for the whole circuit, whereas the ﬁgures of 3k, 10k,
and 5k Ω are individual quantities for individual resistors. If we were to plug a ﬁgure for total
voltage into an Ohm’s Law equation with a ﬁgure for individual resistance, the result would
not relate accurately to any quantity in the real circuit.
