A Wheatstone bridge is a measuring instrument 
that was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie in 1833. 
In 1843, a talented and versatile scientist named Sir 
Charles Wheatstone improved on the original design 
of the Wheatstone bridge. He did not claim to have 
invented the circuit named after him, but he was the 
first to use the circuit effectively for making resistance 
measurements.
