Hereâ€™s the important thing: If the supply voltage varies up or down around its 
nominal 9 V value, the current in the circuit will fluctuate but the voltage  
across the load will remain the same: a constant 6.8 V. The Zener diode 
allows current fluctuations while stabilizing the voltage, whereas the resistor 
 voltage varies as the current fluctuates.
