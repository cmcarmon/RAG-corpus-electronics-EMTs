The measuring circuit in figure 3-2 also contains two branches. The resistance, capacitance, or 
inductance to be measured is connected to branch X of the bridge-measuring circuit. The subscript X is 
also used in figure 3-1 to designate the circuit parameters involved in computing the values of various 
electronic parts. Branch S contains the variable control used to bring the bridge into a balanced condition. 
A potentiometer is used for this purpose in most bridge equipment, because it offers a wide range of 
smoothly variable current changes within the measuring circuit.
