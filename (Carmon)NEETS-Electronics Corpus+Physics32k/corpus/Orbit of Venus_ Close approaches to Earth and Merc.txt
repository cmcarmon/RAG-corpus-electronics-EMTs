In this current era, the nearest that Venus comes to Earth is just under 40 Gm. Because the range of heliocentric distances is greater for the Earth than for Venus, the closest approaches come near Earth's perihelion. The Earth's declining eccentricity is increasing the minimum distances. The last time Venus drew nearer than 39.5 Gm was in 1623, but that will not happen again for many millennia, and in fact after 5683 Venus will not even come closer than 40 Gm for about 60,000 years.  The orientation of the orbits of the two planets is not favorable for minimizing the close approach distance. The longitudes of perihelion were only 29 degrees apart at J2000, so the smallest distances, which come when inferior conjunction happens near Earth's perihelion, occur when Venus is near perihelion. An example was the transit of December 6, 1882: Venus reached perihelion Jan 9, 1883, and Earth did the same on December 31. Venus was 0.7205 au from the Sun on the day of transit, decidedly less than average.
Moving far backwards in time, more than 200,000 years ago Venus sometimes passed by at a distance barely less than 38 Gm, and will next do that after more than 400,000 years.
Mercury comes closer than Earth does, and those distances will become smaller over time primarily because of Mercury's increasing eccentricity.
