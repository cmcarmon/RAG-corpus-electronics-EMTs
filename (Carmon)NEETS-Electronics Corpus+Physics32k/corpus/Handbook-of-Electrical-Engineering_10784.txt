of space). Using this principle, frequency balance equations can be easily written (one for each state) and solved
in conjunction with the fact that the sum of the steady-state proabilities of all the states must be equal to unity
to obtain the steady state probabilities. This procedure is much simpler than solving the Markov differential
equations and letting t ﬁ ¥.
