POTENTIOMETERÂ—A variable resistor, used as a position sensor in servosystems, having a terminal 
connected to each end of a resistive element and a third terminal connected to a wiper contact. The 
output is a voltage that is variable depending upon the position of the wiper contact. The potentiometer 
is commonly referred to as a variable voltage divider. It, in effect, converts mechanical information into 
an electrical signal [1] [15].
