The concept of the 
Second World War with the use of vacuum tubes in dc ampliﬁer designs developed by the George A. Philbrick
Co. [some of the early history of operational ampliﬁers is found in Williams, 1991]. The op amp was the basic
building block for early electronic servomechanisms, for synthesizers, and in particular for analog computers
used to solve differential equations. With the advent of the ﬁrst monolithic integrated-circuit (IC) op amp in
m
1965 (the 
A709, designed by the late Bob Widlar, then with Fairchild Semiconductor), the availability of op
amps was no longer a factor, while within a few years the cost of these devices (which had been as high as $200
each) rapidly plummeted to close to that of individual discrete transistors.
