Chapter 3, ‘‘Conﬁgurable Computing,’’ by Wayne Luk, Peter
Y. K. Cheung, and Nabeel Shirazi, ﬁrst presents an overview of
conﬁgurable
computing technology and then describes
methods for reconﬁguration, tools for conﬁgurable designs,
and the automatic detection of reconﬁgurable regions. In
particular, it covers an efﬁcient approach to exploit run-time
reconﬁgurability. FPGAs have become the favored choice in
implementing glue logic, experimental systems, and hardware
prototypes due to their clear advantages in user reconﬁgur-
ability, short turnaround time, and low development costs.
