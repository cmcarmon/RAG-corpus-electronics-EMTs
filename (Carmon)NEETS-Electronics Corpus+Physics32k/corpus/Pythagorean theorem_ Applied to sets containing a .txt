This generalized formula can be applied in the simplest case to a single one-dimensional object, a line segment, in two-dimensional space. The animation illustrates this case with a line segment shown in blue and its projections onto the x- and y- axes shown in green. The lengths of the projections squared and added together are equal to the length of the original line segment squared. This produces the familiar Pythagorean theorem formula:





a

2


+

b

2


=

c

2




{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}

where c is the length of the original line segment, a is the length of the segment projected onto the x-axis, and b is the length of the segment projected onto the y-axis. In the animation, a2 = 27, b2 = 9, and c2 = 36. Bringing the line segment together with its coordinate projections forms the traditional right triangle.

Similarly, for any two-dimensional object in three-dimensional space, the formula can be stated as:





A

2


+

B

2


+

C

2


=

D

2




{\displaystyle A^{2}+B^{2}+C^{2}=D^{2}}

where D is the area of a specified two-dimensional object, A is the area of the object's projection onto the xy-coordinate plane, B is the area of the object's projection onto the xz-coordinate plane, and C is the area of the object's projection onto the yz-coordinate plane.
The animation showing a blue three-by-three square object in three dimensions of space illustrates this application of the generalization to an object of more than one dimension. As the orientation of the object changes, the proportions of the green coordinate plane projections adjust accordingly, so the squares of the areas of the projections always add up to the same value: the square of the area of the original object. In this case, the sum of the squares of the projection areas always add up to 81.
