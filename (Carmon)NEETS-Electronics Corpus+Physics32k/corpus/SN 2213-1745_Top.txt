SN 2213-1745 was an extremely remote superluminous supernova (SLSN), which occurred in between November 2004 and June 2005. Its peak far-ultraviolet absolute magnitude reached −21.2, which was comparable to the total absolute magnitude of its host galaxy. The distance (redshift) to this supernova z=2.0458 ± 0.0005 makes it one of the most remote supernova observed as of 2012. The luminosity of SN 2213-1745 evolved slowly over several years as it was still detectable in November 2006. Both the high luminosity and slow decay indicate that the supernova's progenitor was a star with an initial mass as high as 250 solar masses. The supernova explosion itself was likely a pair-instability supernova similar to the SN 2007bi event, with which it shares many similarities.
