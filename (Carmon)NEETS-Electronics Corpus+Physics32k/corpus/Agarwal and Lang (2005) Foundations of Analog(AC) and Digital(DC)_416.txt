Now, let us practice working with node voltages. Figure 3.2 shows our
circuit from Figure 3.1 with a known set of branch voltages and currents. Let us
determine the node voltages ea and eb. The node voltage ea is the potential dif-
ference between node a and node c. To find the potential difference, let us start
at node c and work our way to node a accumulating potential differences along
the path c â†’ a. Thus, starting at node c, we count an increase in potential of 2 V
as we traverse the voltage source and reach node a. Thus ea = 2 V.
