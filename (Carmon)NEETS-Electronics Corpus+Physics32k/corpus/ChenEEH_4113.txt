If the transmitted pulses are allowed to take on any of M
transmitted levels with equal probability, then the information
rate per transmitted pulse is log2 M bits. For a constant infor-
mation rate, the bandwidth of the transmitted system can be
reduced by the same factor. With M-ary transmission, we will
show that the error rates are higher, but if we have sufﬁcient
