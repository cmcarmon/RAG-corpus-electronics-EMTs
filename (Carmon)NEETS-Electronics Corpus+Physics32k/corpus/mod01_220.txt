Electric current has been defined as the directed movement of electrons. Directed drift, therefore, is
current and the terms can be used interchangeably. The expression directed drift is particularly helpful in
differentiating between the random and directed motion of electrons. However, CURRENT FLOW is the
terminology most commonly used in indicating a directed movement of electrons.
