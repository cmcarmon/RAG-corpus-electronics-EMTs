If design could begin with a clean slate, the ﬁrst step would be to decide which mode of transportation and
which power source is best suited for the application, based on geography, priority of the passenger or cargo
to be transported, energy efﬁciency, safety, cost per mile, and other factors. However, this is not really possible
because  the  factors  relating  to  funding  sources  and  existing  infrastructure  often  outweigh  any  technical
considerations.
