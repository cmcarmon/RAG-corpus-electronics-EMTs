Also, voltages lower than 30 can be dangerous if they are enough to induce an unpleasant
sensation, which may cause you to jerk and accidently come into contact across a higher voltage
or some other hazard. I recall once working on a automobile on a hot summer day. I was
wearing shorts, my bare leg contacting the chrome bumper of the vehicle as I tightened battery
connections. When I touched my metal wrench to the positive (ungrounded) side of the 12 volt
battery, I could feel a tingling sensation at the point where my leg was touching the bumper.
The combination of Ô¨Årm contact with metal and my sweaty skin made it possible to feel a shock
with only 12 volts of electrical potential.
