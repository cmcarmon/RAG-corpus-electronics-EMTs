In the past several decades, graph theory has been widely used in electrical engineering, computer science,
social science, and in the solution of economic problems [Swamy and Thulasiraman, 1981; Chen, 1990]. Ô¨Ånally,
the application of graph theory in conjunction with symbolic network analysis and computer-aided simulation
of electronic circuits has been well recognized in recent years [Lin, 1991].
