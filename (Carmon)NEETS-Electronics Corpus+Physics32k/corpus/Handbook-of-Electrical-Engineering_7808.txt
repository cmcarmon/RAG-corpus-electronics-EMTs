Access Time
The direct-access storage device or DASD, used in computer
systems for the mass storage of digital information, is a disk
drive capable of storing large quantities of data and accessing
blocks  of  this  data  rapidly  and  in  arbitrary  order.  In
read/write operations it is often necessary to move the head
to new locations in search of sectors containing speciﬁc data
items. Such relocations are usually time-consuming and can
become the factor that limits performance in certain appli-
cations.  The  access  time  ta  is  deﬁned  as  the  average  time
spent in going from one randomly selected spot on the disk to another. ta can be considered the sum of a seek
time, ts , which is the average time needed to acquire the target track, and a latency, tl , which is the average
time spent on the target track waiting for the desired sector. Thus,
