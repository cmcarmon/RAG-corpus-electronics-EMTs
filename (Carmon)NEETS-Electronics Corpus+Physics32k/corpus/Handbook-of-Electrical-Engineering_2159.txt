On the other hand, if the size of the network is too large, performance may also suffer. This is the phenomenon
of overﬁtting that we mentioned above. But one alternative way to control it is to reduce the size of the network.
There are basically two procedures to set the size of the network: either one starts small and adds new PEs or
one  starts  with  a  large  network  and  prunes  PEs  [Haykin,  1994].  One  quick  way  to  prune  the  network  is  to
impose a penalty term in the performance function — a regularizing term — such as limiting the slope of the
input/output map [Bishop, 1995]. A regularization term that can be implemented locally is
