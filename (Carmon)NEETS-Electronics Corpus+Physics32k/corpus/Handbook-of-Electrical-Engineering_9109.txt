• The changeable part of software application is always loaded to EEPROM. In both cases, EEPROM keeps
“add-ins”  stored  in  ROM.  For  proprietary  OS,  this  is  the “ﬁlter”  consisting  of  either  additional  func-
tionalities or corrective patches. For open OS, real functional software is stored. EEPROM contents may
be loaded to the card during personalization process (when a real, customer-dedicated card is manu-
factured) or in any moment of a card’s life cycle.
