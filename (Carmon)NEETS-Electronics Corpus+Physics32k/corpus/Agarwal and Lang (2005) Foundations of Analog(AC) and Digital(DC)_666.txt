The small signal method applies to circuits in which nonlinear devices
are operated only over a very small range of voltage or current values.
For small perturbations of voltages or currents about a nominal operating
point, nonlinear device behavior can be approximated using a piecewise
linear model that provides a good fit in the narrow operating range. Thus,
incremental variables not only satisfy KVL and KCL, but also linear v i
relations over the narrow operating range.
