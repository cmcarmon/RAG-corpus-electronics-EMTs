Use alligator clips or a solderless breadboard to set up the circuit (see 
Figure 5­3), starting with the 470 Ω resistor. Remember to orient the LED 
correctly, connecting the shorter lead of the LED to the negative battery 
terminal. Don’t worry about the orientation of the resistor; either way is fine. 
Note how brightly the LED shines. Then remove the resistor and replace it 
with the other resistors, one at a time, increasing the amount of resistance 
each time. Did you notice that the LED shines less brightly each time? That’s 
because higher resistances restrict current more, and the less current an 
LED receives, the less brightly it shines.
