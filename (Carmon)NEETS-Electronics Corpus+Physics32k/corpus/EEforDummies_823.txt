Capturing sound with microphones
Microphones are input transducers that convert acoustic energy (otherwise 
known as sound) into electrical energy. Most use a thin membrane, or dia-
phragm, that vibrates in response to air pressure changes from sound. The 
vibrations of the membrane are translated into an AC electrical signal in vari-
ous ways, depending on the type of microphone:
