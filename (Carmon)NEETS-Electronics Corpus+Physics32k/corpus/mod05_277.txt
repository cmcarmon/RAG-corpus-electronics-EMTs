GENERATOR RATINGS are dependent on the amount of current they are capable of providing at
full output voltage; this rating is expressed as the product of the voltage times the current. A 10-volt
alternator capable of supplying 10 amperes of current would be rated at 100 volt-amperes. Larger
alternators are rated in kilovolt-amperes.
