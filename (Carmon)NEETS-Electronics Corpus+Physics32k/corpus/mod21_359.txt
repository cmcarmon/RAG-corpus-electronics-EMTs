second for thermistor beads. The thermistor type of bolometer element is usually composed of a ceramic-
like mixture of metallic oxides having a large negative temperature coefficient of resistance. Two fine 
platinum-alloy wires are embedded in the bead, after which the bead is heated and coated with a glass 
film. Typical dimensions of a thermistor bead used for microwave measurements are 0.015 inch along its 
major axis and 0.010 inch along its minor axis. The thermistor bead may be operated at high 
temperatures; it is rugged, both electrically and mechanically; it has high resistance-power sensitivity; and 
it has a good temperature-power sensitivity. In addition, it can endure large pulse energies; it has a 
sluggish thermal response; and it has negligible pulsed-power measurement errors. The more sensitive 
thermistor requires thermal shielding or heat compensation for best operation.
