Also shown in view (A) is the variation along the amplitude axis caused by the same noise and
interference mentioned earlier. The right-hand portion of view (A) illustrates the elimination of this noise
by the receiving equipment. View (B) clearly shows that scanning the signal along the amplitude and time
axes reproduces no amplitude variations from signal interference. However, if the scanning is
accomplished along the frequency and time axes, the intelligence is reproduced, as shown in view (C). By
this system, the intelligence can be recovered at the receiving station in its original form; it will be nearly
unaffected by conditions in the radio path other than fading. As a matter of fact, fsk resists the effects of
fading better than cw.
