At the implementation detail level, there are two different
approaches to hardware microrollback: clock cycle microroll-
back (state changes saved at every clock cycle), as described by
Sparmann and Reddy (1994) and instruction microrollback:
(state changes saved at the completion of every instruction
execution, as described by Trovo (2002)).
