2.2 Elemental Signals4
Elemental signals are the building blocks with which we build complicated signals. By deﬁnition,
elemental signals have a simple structure. Exactly what we mean by the “structure of a signal” will unfold in
this section of the course. Signals are nothing more than functions deﬁned with respect to some independent
variable, which we take to be time for the most part. Very interesting signals are not functions solely of
time; one great example of which is an image. For it, the independent variables are x and y (two-dimensional
space). Video signals are functions of three variables: two spatial dimensions and time. Fortunately, most
of the ideas underlying modern signal theory can be exempliﬁed with one-dimensional signals.
