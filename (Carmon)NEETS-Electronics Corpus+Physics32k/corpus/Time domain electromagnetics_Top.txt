In physics and mathematics the time domain electromagnetics refers to one of two general groups of techniques (in mathematics, often called ans√§tze) for the description of electromagnetic wave motion. In contrast to the frequency domain electromagnetics, based on the Fourier or Laplace transform, time domain one keeps time as an explicit independent variable in the descriptive equations or wave motion.
