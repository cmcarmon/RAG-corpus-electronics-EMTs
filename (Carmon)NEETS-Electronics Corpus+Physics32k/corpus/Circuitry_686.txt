to  the  ‘Dual’  position.  The  oscilloscope  can  be 
triggered  by  either  of  the  signals  (Channel  1  or 
Channel 2) as desired. Once again, the display can 
be triggered on the positive or negative-going edge 
of the waveform depending upon the setting of the 
trigger polarity button. Dual-channel operation can 
be invaluable when it is necessary to compare two 
waveforms, e.g. the input and output waveforms of 
an amplifier.
