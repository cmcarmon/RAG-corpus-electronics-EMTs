Seawater is moved in a vertical circular motion when a wave passes. The radius of the circle of motion for any given water molecule decreases with depth.
The maximum depth of influence of a water wave is half the wavelength. Below that depth the water remains stationary as the wave passes.
For instance, in a pool of water 1 foot (0.30 m) deep, a wave with a wavelength of 1 foot (0.30 m) would not be able to cause water movement on the bottom. However, a wave with a 2 feet (0.61 m) wavelength would be moving the water (barely) at the bottom.
