Figure 2.29(D) shows the reduction in memory size for the
two different steps of in-place data mapping obtained using a
prototype tool. We observe that the initial algorithm requires
314K words, the intrasignal in-place mapped version needs
2387 words, and the intersignal
in-place mapped version
(after intrasignal in-place mapping) needs 1130 words. The
beneÔ¨Åts of these two steps are clearly evident. Figure 2.29(E)
presents the comparison of the number of instructions and
the code size for different cases. We observe that the overhead
in code size and instructions are less than 15% for the most
optimized case (64 words globally optimized), which is very
acceptable for these application kernels because typically also a
larger amount of additional purely control dominated code is
present in the program memory. To conclude, we have exe-
cuted the different algorithms on three different workstations
to observe the performance gains. As shown in Figure 2.29(F),
we observe an increase in performance by 20% on average,
which is obtained apart from the large gains in power con-
sumption.
