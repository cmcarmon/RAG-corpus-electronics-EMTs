In magnetostatics equations such as Ampère's Law or the more general Biot–Savart law allow one to solve for the magnetic fields produced by steady electrical currents. Often, however, one may want to calculate the magnetic field due to time varying currents (accelerating charge) or other forms of moving charge. Strictly speaking, in these cases the aforementioned equations are invalid, as the field measured at the observer must incorporate distances measured at the retarded time, that is the observation time minus the time it took for the field (traveling at the speed of light) to reach the observer. The retarded time is different for every point to be considered, hence the resulting equations are quite complicated; often it is easier to formulate the problem in terms of potentials; see retarded potential and Jefimenko's equations.
In this point of view the quasistatic approximation is obtained by using time instead of retarded time or equivalently to assume that the speed of light is infinite. To first order, the mistake of using only Biot–Savart's law rather than both terms of Jefimenko's magnetic field equation fortuitously cancel.
