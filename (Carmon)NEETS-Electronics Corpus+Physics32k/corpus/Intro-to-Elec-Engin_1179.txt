Parallel Operation of Interconnected Synchronous Generators
In order to assure continuity of the power supply within prescribed limits of frequency and voltage
at all the load points scattered over the service area, it becomes necessary in any modern power
system to operate several alternators in parallel, interconnected by various transmission lines, in
a well-coordinated and optimized manner for the most economical operation. A generator can be
paralleled with an inﬁnite bus (or with another generator running at rated voltage and frequency
supplying the load) by driving it at synchronous speed corresponding to the system frequency and
adjusting its ﬁeld excitation so that its terminal voltage equals that of the bus. If the frequency of
the incoming machine is not exactly equal to that of the system, the phase relation between its
voltage and the bus voltage will vary at a frequency equal to the difference between the frequencies
of the machine and the bus voltages. In normal practice, this difference can usually be made quite
small, to a fraction of a hertz; in polyphase systems, it is essential that the same phase sequence be
