The Method of Moments
Numerical  implementation  of  the  moment  method  is  a  relatively  straightforward,  and  an  intuitively  logical,
extension  of  these  basic  elements  of  numerical  analysis,  as  described  in  the  book  by  Harrington  [1968]  and
discussed and used extensively in CEM [see, for example, Mittra, 1973, 1975; Strait, 1980; Poggio and Miller,
1988]. Whether it is an integral equation, a differential equation, or another approach that is being used for
the numerical model, three essential sampling operations are involved in reducing the analytical formulation
via the moment method to a computer algorithm as outlined in Table 45.7. We note that operator sampling
can ultimately determine the sampling density needed to achieve a desired accuracy in the source–ﬁeld rela-
tionships involving integral operators, especially at and near the “self term,” where the observation and source
points become coincident or nearly so and the integral becomes nearly singular. Whatever the method used
for these sampling operations, they lead to a linear system of equations or matrix approximation of the original
integral or differential operators. Because the operations and choices involved in developing this matrix descrip-
tion are common to all moment-method models, we shall discuss them in somewhat more detail.
