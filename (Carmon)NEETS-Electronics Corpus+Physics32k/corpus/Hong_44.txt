 
1.  Write a set of differential equations to describe the circuit; 
2.  Laplace  transform  the  differential  equations  to  algebraic  equations  in  s-
domain; 
3.  Solve for the transfer function in the s-domain; 
4.  Laplace transform the input signal and multiply this by the transfer function to 
give the output signal in the s-domain; 
5.  Inverse  Laplace  transform  the  output  signal  to  give  circuit  response  as  a 
function in the time domain.
