The CE102 requirement is applicable to all power cords (either AC or DC source) including returns utilizing
ﬁve nominal voltage levels. The limit based on a nominal 28 V or less and the limit for 200 V are depicted in
Fig.  40.16  d.  For  the  other  operating  voltage  levels  (115,  270,  and  440 V),  the  limit  is  modiﬁed  by  adding  a
relaxation  factor  corresponding  to  the  intended  line  voltage  to  the  28-V  limit.  The  220-V  limit  is  9  dB  less
stringent than the 28-V limit.
