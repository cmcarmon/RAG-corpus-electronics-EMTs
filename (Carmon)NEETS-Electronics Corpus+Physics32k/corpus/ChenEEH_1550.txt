important expert
systems were developed. At Stanford, Edward Feigenbaum,
Joshua Ledergerg, Bruce Buchanan, and Georgia Sutherland
developed DENDRAL, the Ô¨Årst expert system that interpreted
the output of a mass spectrometer for analysis of the structure
of organic chemical compounds. At MIT, Joseph Weizenbaum
built ELIZA, an interactive dialog expert system, and Joel
Moses built MACSYMA, an expert system using symbolic
reasoning for solving mathematical problems. During the
1960s, LISP was the dominant programming language used
in developing expert systems.
