▶✓ Err on the side of caution. Take a lesson 
from Mr. Murphy, and assume that if some-
thing can go wrong, it will. Keep your work 
environment  free  of  all  liquids,  pets,  and 
small children. Post a first‐aid chart nearby. 
Don’t work when you’re tired or distracted. 
Be serious and focused while you’re work-
ing around electricity.
