The reproduce head transforms the magnetic field from the magnetic tape back into an electrical
signal. As explained in chapters 3 and 5, the head gap of a recorder’s reproduce head and the operating
speed of the magnetic tape transport determine the wavelength of the reproduce head. The wavelength
determines the center frequency of a recorder’s frequency-response specification. Once you pass this
center frequency, both below and above, the output voltage level of the recorder’s reproduce head will
decrease. Figure 6-2 shows this. This is why the equalization circuits described in chapter 5, figure 5-3,
are used.
