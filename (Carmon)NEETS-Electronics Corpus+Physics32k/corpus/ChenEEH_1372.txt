Multiprocessor systems are being used successfully today to
improve performance in systems running multiple programs
concurrently. In addition, multiprocessor systems have shown
the ability to improve single-program performance signiﬁ-
cantly for certain applications containing easily parallelized
loops. The extraction of coarse-grained parallelism from a
software description and,
languages
used to describe parallel software are a ﬂourishing area of
research.
