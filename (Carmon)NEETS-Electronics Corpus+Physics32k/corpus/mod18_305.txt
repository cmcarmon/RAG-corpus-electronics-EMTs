advances in the field of solid-state microwave amplifiers have produced solid-state amplifiers with
enough output power to be used as the first stage in some systems. Transmitters with more than three
stages usually use crossed-field amplifiers in the third and any additional stages. Both traveling-wave
tubes and crossed-field amplifiers have a very flat amplification response over a relatively wide frequency
range.
