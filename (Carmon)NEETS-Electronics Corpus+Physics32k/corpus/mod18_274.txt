The magnetron is an electron tube in which a magnetic (H) field between the cathode and plate is
perpendicular to an electric (E) field. Tuned circuits, in the form of cylindrical cavities in the plate,
produce rf electric fields. Electrons interact with these fields in the space between the cathode and plate to
produce an ac power output. Magnetrons function as self-excited microwave oscillators. These
multicavity devices may be used in radar transmitters as either pulsed or cw oscillators at frequencies
ranging from approximately 600 to 30,000 megahertz. (If you wish to review magnetron operation in
more detail, refer to NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles.)
