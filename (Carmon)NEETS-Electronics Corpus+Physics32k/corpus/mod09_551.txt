At T2 the input signal becomes −50 volts again. This −50 volts is in series opposition to the 8-volt 
charge on the capacitor. Thus, the voltage across R totals −42 volts (−50 plus +8 volts). Notice that this 
value of voltage (−42 volts) is smaller in amplitude than the amplitude of the output voltage which 
occurred at TO (−50 volts). Capacitor C now charges from +8 to +16 volts. If we were to continue to 
follow the operation of the circuit, we would find that the output wave shape would become exactly 
distributed around the 0-volt reference point. At that time the circuit operation would have reached a 
stable operating point. Note that the output wave shape has the same amplitude and approximately the 
same shape as the input wave shape, but now "rides" equally above and below 0 volts. Clampers use this 
RC time so that the input and output waveforms will be almost identical, as shown from T11 to T12.
