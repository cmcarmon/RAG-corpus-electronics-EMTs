An extension of the network diagram input is to make the diagram relate to the actual topography. In these
cases,  the  actual  routes  of  transmission  lines  are  shown  and  can  be  superimposed  on  computer  generated
geographical maps. The lines in these cases have their lengths automatically established and, if the line char-
acteristics are known, the line parameters can be calculated.
