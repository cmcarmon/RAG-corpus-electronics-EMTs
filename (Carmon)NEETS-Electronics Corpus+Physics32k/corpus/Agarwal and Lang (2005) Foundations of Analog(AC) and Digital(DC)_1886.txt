so after the transient has died out, vo(t) (cid:5) vi(t). That is, the resistor voltage
looks just like the drive voltage. The inductor at low frequencies must behave
like a short circuit, because its impedance approaches zero for ω small.
At high frequencies, specifically, where ω1 is such that (ω1L)2 (cid:7) R2,
