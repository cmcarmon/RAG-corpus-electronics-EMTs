A three-phase line supplies the larger loads. These loads are protected by CBs or high-power fuses.
Most primary feeders in rural areas are overhead lines using pole-mounted distribution transformers. The
capacitor  banks  and  the  reclosing  and  sectionalizing  switches  are  also  pole-mounted.  Overhead  lines  reduce
the installation costs but reduce aesthetics.
