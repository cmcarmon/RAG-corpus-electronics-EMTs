A rectangular wave is similar to the square wave. The difference is that in the rectangular waveform, 
the two alternations of the waveform are of unequal time duration. Figure 3-1, view (C), shows that the 
negative alternation (pulse) is shorter (in time) than the positive alternation. The negative alternation 
could be represented as the longer of the two alternations. Either way, the appearance is that of a 
rectangle.
