13.62. Then find the response vl(t) for i(t) = I cos(ωt) under steady-state conditions.
Referring to Figure 13.63, given i(t) = I0 cos(ωt), where I0 =
e x e r c i s e 13.4
3 mA and ω = 106 rad/s, determine v(t) in the sinusoidal steady state. Assume R = 1 k
and L = 1 mH.

The two-terminal linear network in Figure 13.64 is known to
contain exactly two elements. The magnitude of the impedance function is as shown
(log-log coordinates).
