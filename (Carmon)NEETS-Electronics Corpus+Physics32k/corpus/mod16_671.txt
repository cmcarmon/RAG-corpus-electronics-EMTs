When the chopping frequency is much higher than the horizontal sweep frequency, the number of
dashes will be very large. For example, if the chopping occurs at 100 kilohertz and the sweep frequency is
1 kilohertz, each horizontal line would then appear as a series of closely spaced dots, as shown in figure
6-37 view B. As the sweep frequency becomes lower compared to the chopping frequency, the display
will show apparently continuous traces; therefore, the CHOP mode is used at low sweep rates.
