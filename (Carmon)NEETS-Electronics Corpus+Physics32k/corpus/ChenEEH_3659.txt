the phoneme. We mention only a few salient facts about the
various of phoneme classes,
leaving detailed study to the
reader’s further pursuit (Deller et al., 2000; Ladefoged, 1975).
A phoneme is continuant if the speech sound is produced
by a steady-state vocal-tract conﬁguration and noncontinuant
if a change in the vocal-tract conﬁguration is required. The
phonemes in Table 3.1 are classiﬁed based on the continuant/
noncontinuant property. Noncontinuant phonemes are gener-
ally more difﬁcult to characterize and model.
