To test Zener diodes, you must use a higher voltage than the oscilloscope line-test signal. This test
can be made with a diode test set or with the circuit shown in figure 2-17. In this circuit, rheostat R1 is
used to adjust the input voltage to a suitable value for the Zener diode being tested. Resistor R2 limits the
current through the diode. The signal voltage applied to the diode is also connected to the horizontal input
of the oscilloscope. The voltage developed across current-measuring resistor R3 is applied to the vertical
input of the oscilloscope. The horizontal sweep represents the applied voltage, and the vertical deflection
indicates the current through the diode being tested. Figure 2-18 shows the characteristic pattern of a
Zener diode. Note the sharp increase in current at the Zener voltage (avalanche) point. For the Zener
diode to be usable, this voltage must be within limits specified by the manufacturer.
