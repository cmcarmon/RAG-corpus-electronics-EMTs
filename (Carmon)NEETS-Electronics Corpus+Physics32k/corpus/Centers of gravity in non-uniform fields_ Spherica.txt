If the external gravitational field is spherically symmetric, then it is equivalent to the field of a point mass M at the center of symmetry r. In this case, the center of gravity can be defined as the point at which the total force on the body is given by Newton's Law:

{\displaystyle {\frac {GmM(\mathbf {r} _{\mathrm {cg} }-\mathbf {r} )}{|\mathbf {r} _{\mathrm {cg} }-\mathbf {r} |^{3}}}=\mathbf {F} ,}

where G is the gravitational constant and m is the mass of the body. As long as the total force is nonzero, this equation has a unique solution, and it satisfies the torque requirement. A convenient feature of this definition is that if the body is itself spherically symmetric, then rcg lies at its center of mass. In general, as the distance between r and the body increases, the center of gravity approaches the center of mass.
Another way to view this definition is to consider the gravitational field of the body; then rcg is the apparent source of gravitational attraction for an observer located at r. For this reason, rcg is sometimes referred to as the center of gravity of M relative to the point r.
