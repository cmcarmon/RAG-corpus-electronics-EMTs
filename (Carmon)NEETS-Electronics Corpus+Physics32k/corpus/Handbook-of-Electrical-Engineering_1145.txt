Thus,  only  the  output  samples  from  n  =  N  to  n  =  L  –  1  are  the  same  as  those  that  would  result  from  the
convolution of the impulse response with the inﬁnite-length data sequence  x(n). The ﬁrst N data points are
corrupted and must therefore be discarded. So that the output data sequence does not have N-point “gaps” in
it,  it  is  therefore  necessary  to overlap the  data  in  adjacent  input  data  blocks.  In  carrying  out  the  processing,
samples from block to block are saved so that the last N points of the ith data block xi(n) are the same as the
ﬁrst N points of the following data block xi+1(n). Each processed L-point data block thus produces L – N output
samples.
