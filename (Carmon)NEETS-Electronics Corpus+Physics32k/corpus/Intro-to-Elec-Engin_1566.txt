15.2.31 Let m1(t) and m2(t) be two message signals, and
let u1(t) and u2(t) be the corresponding modulated
versions.
(a) When the combined message signal m1(t) +
m2(t) DSB modulates a carrier Ac cos 2πfct,
show that the result is the sum of the two DSB
AM signals u1(t) + u2(t). That is to say, AM
satisﬁes the superposition principle.
(b) If m1(t)+ m2(t) frequency modulates a carrier,
show that the modulated signal is not equal to
u1(t) + u2(t). That is to say, FM does not sat-
isfy the principle of superposition, and angle
modulation is not a linear modulation method.
15.2.32 Figure P15.2.32 shows an FM discriminator. As-
sume the envelope detector to be ideal, with an
inﬁnite input impedance. Choose the values for L
and C if the discriminator is to be employed to
demodulate an FM signal with a carrier frequency
fc = 80 MHz and a peak frequency deviation of 6
MHz.
