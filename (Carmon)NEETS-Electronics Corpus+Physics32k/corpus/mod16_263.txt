WAVEFORM ANALYSIS can be made by observing displays of voltage and current variations with
respect to time or by harmonic analysis of complex signals. Waveform displays are particularly valuable
for adjusting and testing pulse-generating, pulse-forming, and pulse-amplifying circuits. The waveform
visual display is also useful for determining signal distortion, phase shift, modulation factor, frequency,
and peak-to-peak voltage.
