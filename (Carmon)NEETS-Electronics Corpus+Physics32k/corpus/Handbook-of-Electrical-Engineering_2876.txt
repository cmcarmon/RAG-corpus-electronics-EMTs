Regardless  of  the  supplier,  frequent  solder  paste  tests  are  advisable,  especially  if  the  solder  is  stored  for
prolonged periods before use. At a minimum, viscosity, percent metal, and solder sphere formation should be
tested [Capillo, 1990]. Solder sphere formation is particularly important because acceptable particle sizes will
vary depending on the pitch of the smallest-pitch part to be used, and the consistency of solder sphere formation
will effect the quality of the Ô¨Ånal solder joint. Round solder spheres have the smallest surface area for a given
