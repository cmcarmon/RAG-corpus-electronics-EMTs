During initial testing the ECP equipment had software glitches, and problems from the ingress of moisture into the equipment. These have now been resolved.
Greater intervals between brake tests are also likely because of the ability of ECP brakes to self-diagnose which should generate large cost savings that will help pay for the system to be installed.
The benefits are better control of braking, less equipment wear from pushing and pulling between cars, shorter stopping distance and improved headways.
