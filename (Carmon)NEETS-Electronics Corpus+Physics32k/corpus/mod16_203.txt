The basic unit of measurement in the system is not the decibel; it is the bel. The bel is a unit that
expresses the logarithmic ratio between the input and the output of any given component, circuit, or
system. It may be expressed in terms of voltage, current, or power. Most often, it is used to show the ratio
between input and output power to figure gain. You can express the power gain of the amplifier (N) in
bels by dividing the output (P1) by the input (P2) and taking the base 10 logarithm of the resulting
quotient. The formula for determining this gain is:
