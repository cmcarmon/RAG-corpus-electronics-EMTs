o = 8.854210–12 F/m is the free-space permittivity, and mo = 4p210– 7 H/m is the free-space permeability.
The conditions for each medium type are merely substituted in Eqs. (37.10) to (37.21) to obtain the wave
properties for that medium. The formulas for calculating attenuation constant, phase constant, and intrinsic
impedance for different media are summarized in Table 37.1.
