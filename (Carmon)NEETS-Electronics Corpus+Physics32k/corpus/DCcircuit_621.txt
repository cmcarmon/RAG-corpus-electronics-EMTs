Now weâ€™re ready to proceed to some new columns in the table. Knowing that R3 and R4
comprise the parallel subsection R3//R4, and knowing that voltage is shared equally between
parallel components, the increase in voltage seen across the parallel combination R3//R4 must
also be seen across R3 and R4 individually:
