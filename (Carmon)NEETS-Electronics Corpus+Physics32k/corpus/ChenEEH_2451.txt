So, a folded-dipole antenna is a derivative of a regular dipole
antenna with the same radiation pattern, polarization, and
directivity, except with a different input impedance. For the
half-wave case, the folded-dipole antenna simply produces an
impedance transformation by a factor of four. The resulting
292 V impedance is convenient to match to 300 V systems
used in some broadcast applications.
