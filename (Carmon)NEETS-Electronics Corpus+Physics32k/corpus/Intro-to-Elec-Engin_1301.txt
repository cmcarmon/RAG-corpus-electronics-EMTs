Equation (14.1.15) reveals that the spectrum of a periodic signal contains lines at frequencies
of 0, f, 2f, and all higher harmonics of f, although some harmonics may be missing in particular
cases. The zero-frequency or dc component represents the average value a0, the components
corresponding to the Ô¨Årst few harmonics represent relatively slow time variations, and the higher
harmonics represent more rapid time variations.
