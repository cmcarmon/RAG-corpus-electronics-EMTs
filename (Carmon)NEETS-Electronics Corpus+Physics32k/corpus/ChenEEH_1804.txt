that consider only one metric (either hop count or line cost)
and minimize it to ﬁnd the shortest path from the source to
the destination. Thus, all trafﬁc is routed along the shortest
path leading to congestion on some links, while other links
might remain underutilized. Furthermore, if link congestion is
used to derive the line cost such that highly congested links
have a higher cost, then such algorithms can cause oscillations
in the network, where trafﬁc load continuously shifts from
heavily congested links to lightly congested links, and this
will increase the delay and jitter experienced by end users.
