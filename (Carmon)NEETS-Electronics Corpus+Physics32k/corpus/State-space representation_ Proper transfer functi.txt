Transfer functions which are only proper (and not strictly proper) can also be realised quite easily. The trick here is to separate the transfer function into two parts: a strictly proper part and a constant.






G


(
s
)
=



G




S
P



(
s
)
+


G


(
∞
)
.


{\displaystyle {\textbf {G}}(s)={\textbf {G}}_{\mathrm {SP} }(s)+{\textbf {G}}(\infty ).}

The strictly proper transfer function can then be transformed into a canonical state-space realization using techniques shown above. The state-space realization of the constant is trivially





y


(
t
)
=


G


(
∞
)


u


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\textbf {y}}(t)={\textbf {G}}(\infty ){\textbf {u}}(t)}
. Together we then get a state-space realization with matrices A, B and C determined by the strictly proper part, and matrix D determined by the constant.
Here is an example to clear things up a bit:






G


(
s
)
=

{\displaystyle {\textbf {G}}(s)={\frac {s^{2}+3s+3}{s^{2}+2s+1}}={\frac {s+2}{s^{2}+2s+1}}+1}

which yields the following controllable realization

{\displaystyle {\dot {\textbf {x}}}(t)={\begin{bmatrix}-2&-1\\1&0\\\end{bmatrix}}{\textbf {x}}(t)+{\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}}{\textbf {u}}(t)}

u


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\textbf {y}}(t)={\begin{bmatrix}1&2\end{bmatrix}}{\textbf {x}}(t)+{\begin{bmatrix}1\end{bmatrix}}{\textbf {u}}(t)}

Notice how the output also depends directly on the input. This is due to the





G

{\displaystyle {\textbf {G}}(\infty )}
constant in the transfer function.
