Since ions are actually atoms without their normal number of electrons, it is the excess or the lack of
electrons in a substance that determines its charge. In most solids, the transfer of charges is by movement
of electrons rather than ions. The transfer of charges by ions will become more significant when we
consider electrical activity in liquids and gases. At this time, we will discuss electrical behavior in terms
of electron movement.
