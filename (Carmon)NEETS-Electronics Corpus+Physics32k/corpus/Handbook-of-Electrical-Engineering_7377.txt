Multiple measurements can also be transmitted over the carrier by sampling the output of several transducers
in rapid sequence, a technique called time-division multiplexing. This technique has been employed to handle
as many as a million samples per second. It provides for simple data displays and easier separation of channels
for recording or analysis, and it is free of cross talk. If possible, it is advantageous to use no multiplexing at all
for concurrent data taking, but to use separate radio carriers for each measurement being transmitted.
