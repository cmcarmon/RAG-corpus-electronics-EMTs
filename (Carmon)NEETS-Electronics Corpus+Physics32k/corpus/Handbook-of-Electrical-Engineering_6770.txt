A History of Intelligence in the Network
The ﬁrst “intelligence” in the telephone network took the form of rows of human telephone operators, sitting
side by side, plugging cords into jacks to facilitate the handling of calls. These operators established calls to far-
away  points,  selected  the  best  routes  and  provided  billing  information.  They  were  also  an  information
source—providing time or weather or perhaps disseminating the local news. Moreover, they had the opportunity
to demonstrate a kind of heroism—gathering volunteers to save a house from ﬁre, helping to catch a prowler,
locating a lost child, and on and on. In the early years of telephony, the feats of the telephone operator were
indeed legendary.
