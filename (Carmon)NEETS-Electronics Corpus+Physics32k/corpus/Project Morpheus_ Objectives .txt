The primary objectives of the Morpheus project were to demonstrate:
the integrated system performance of the autonomous Guidance, Navigation and Control (GN&C) system,
terrain hazard avoidance sensors,
the coupling of the sensors with the GN&C,
the utilization of an integrated Main/RCS engine liquid oxygen and liquid methane propulsion system.
Specifically, the Morpheus project and the Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) project provide technological foundations for key components necessary to transport humans beyond low Earth orbit.
The testbed can optionally be fitted with up to 1000 lb cargo, facilitating the 400 lb (180 kg) Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) equipment permitting landings without operator interaction. ALHAT permits the lander to fly to a specified location with high accuracy and to automatically avoid hazards including slopes greater than 5 degrees and boulders taller than 30 cm.
In June 2013 the team remarked the potential to scale the 500 kg payload lander up to produce one able to land a habitable module with a crew on places such as the Moon.
