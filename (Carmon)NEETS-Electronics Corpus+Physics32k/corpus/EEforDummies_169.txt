Note that the connection points between components are the same whether 
you built the circuit using a breadboard or alligator clips. The red lead of 
your multimeter should be at a higher voltage than the black lead, so take 
care to orient the probes as described. Set your multimeter to measure DC 
voltage and get ready to take some measurements!
