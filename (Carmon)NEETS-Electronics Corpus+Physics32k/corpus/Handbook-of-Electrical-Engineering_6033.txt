Economic Dispatch
Since  all  the  generating  units  that  are  on-line  have  different  costs  of  generation,  it  is  necessary  to  Ô¨Ånd  the
generation levels of each of these units that would meet the load at the minimum cost. This has to take into
account the fact that the cost of generation in one generator is not proportional to its generation level but is
a nonlinear function of it. In addition, since the system is geographically spread out, the transmission losses
are dependent on the generation pattern and must be considered in obtaining the optimum pattern.
