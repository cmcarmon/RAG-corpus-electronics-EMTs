Intervalley scattering contribution to the piezoresistance of multivalley semiconductors may be comparable
to that of the strain-induced electron repopulation. In this scattering process, the initial and ﬁnal electron states
are  in  different  valleys.  The  effect  of  intervalley  scattering  can  be  deduced  from  the  T –1  dependence  of  the
elastoresistance tensor.
