FOCAL does not require any non-existing technology; however, it has various limitations. A space mission of this duration and distance has never been attempted. A gravity lens will bend objects behind it, so that images from the telescope would be difficult to interpret. FOCAL would be able to observe only objects that are right behind the Sun from its point of view, which means that for every observed object a new telescope would have to be made.
A critique of the technology of the gravity lens telescope was given by Landis. Some of the problems Landis points out include discussion of the interference of the solar corona, which will make the telescope signal to noise ratio poor, the high magnification of the target, which will make the design of the mission focal plane difficult, and an analysis of the inherent spherical aberration of the lens will limit the resolution possible.
