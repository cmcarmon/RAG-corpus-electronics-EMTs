Ve
Average exhaust velocity, m/s. The same measure as specific impulse in different units, numerically equal to specific impulse in N·s/kg.
r
Mixture ratio: mass oxidizer / mass fuel
Tc
Chamber temperature, °C
d
Bulk density of fuel and oxidizer, g/cm³
C*
Characteristic velocity, m/s. Equal to chamber pressure multiplied by throat area, divided by mass flow rate. Used to check experimental rocket's combustion efficiency.
