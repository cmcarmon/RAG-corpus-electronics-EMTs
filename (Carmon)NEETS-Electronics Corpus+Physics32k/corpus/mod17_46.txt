The types of electrical communications are radio and wire. Radio uses electromagnetic waves to 
transmit and receive intelligence. The waves are not guided by a physical path between sender and 
receiver. Wire uses conductors to carry these waves. Radio is the most important method the Navy has of 
communicating between widely separated forces. The transmission methods we will be discussing are 
radiotelegraph, radiotelephone, teletypewriter, and facsimile.
