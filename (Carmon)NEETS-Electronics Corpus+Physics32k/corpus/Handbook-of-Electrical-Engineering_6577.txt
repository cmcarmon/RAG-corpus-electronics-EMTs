Power  budget  calculations  are  illustrated  in
Table 71.1 for a system that includes an ampli-
ﬁer.  A  speciﬁc  numerical  example  is  found  in
the last two columns. The receiver sensitivity in
dBm  is  subtracted  from  the  power  available
from the light source in dBm. This difference is
the loss budget (in decibels) for the system. All
the system losses and gains are added together
(keeping in mind that the losses are negative and
the ampliﬁer gains are positive). If the losses are
more than the gains (as is usual), the system loss
dBSL will be a negative number. The loss margin
is the sum of the loss budget and the system loss.
It  must  be  positive  for  the  system  to  meet  the
receiver  sensitivity  requirements.  The  system
loss margin must be speciﬁed to account for component aging and other possible system degradations. A 6-
dB margin was found for the system illustrated in the table. The ﬁber in the table has a total loss of 24 dB. If
its attenuation is 0.25 dB/km, the total length of ﬁber allowed would be 24/0.25 = 96 km.
