A digital signal can be deﬁned as having any one of a ﬁnite number of discrete amplitudes at any
given time. The signal could be a voltage or current, or just a number such as 0 or 1. A signal for
which only two amplitudes are possible is known as a binary digital signal, the type of which is
commonly used in computers and most digital communication systems. A communication system
that is designed to process only digital signals (or messages) to convey information is said to be
digital. The recent trend is to make as much of the system digital as possible, because:
