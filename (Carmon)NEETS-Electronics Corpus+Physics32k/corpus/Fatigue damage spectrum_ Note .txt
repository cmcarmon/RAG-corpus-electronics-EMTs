Vibrations can damage a mechanical system as a result of several processes, among which are:
the exceeding of characteristic instantaneous stress limits (yield stress, ultimate stress etc.);
the damage by fatigue following the application of a large number of cycles.
FDS is used according to the second criterion. The first criterion is considered with the Extreme response spectrum (ERS).
