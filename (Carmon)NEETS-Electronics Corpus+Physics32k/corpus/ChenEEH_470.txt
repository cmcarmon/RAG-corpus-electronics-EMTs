with rSBi0 as zero-bias value. This automatically includes
changes due to the changes of the SCRs and conductivity
modulation at high collector current densities (Rein and
Schro¨ter, 1991).
The base current entering the internal base region horizon-
tally from the side at y ¼ bE=2 (see Figure 5.5) causes a
voltage drop in the direction of the center (y ¼ 0) that is called
emitter current crowding. Because the hole injection into the
emitter is distributed laterally, the associated lumped internal
base resistance rBi has to be calculated from a differential
equation (Ghosh, 1965; Rein and Schro¨ter, 1989). The formu-
lation for rBi depends on both the mode of operation (e.g., dc
transient and small-signal
low or high-frequency) and the
emitter geometry (e.g., rectangular, square, and circular). The
various cases are discussed below.
Direct Current Operation (v ¼ 0)
A set of equations describing the geometry dependence and
emitter current crowding is given in (Schro¨ter, 1991). The
relations are based on analytical solutions for both a long
rectangular emitter stripe (used in high-speed applications,
for example) and a small square emitter geometry (used in
low-power applications, for example):
