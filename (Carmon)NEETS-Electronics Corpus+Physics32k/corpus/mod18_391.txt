The basic receiver of a radar system often does not meet all the requirements of the radar system, nor
does it always function very well in unfavorable environments. Several special receivers have been
developed to enhance target detection in unfavorable environments or to meet the requirements of special
transmission or scanning methods. A radar system with a moving target indicator (mti) system or a
monopulse scanning system requires a special type of receiver. Other types of special receivers, such as
the logarithmic receiver, have been developed to enhance reception during unfavorable conditions. These
receivers will be discussed in general terms in this section.
