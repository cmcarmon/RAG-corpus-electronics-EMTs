In recent years, light dark matter has become popular due in part to the many benefits of the theory. Sub-GeV dark matter has been used to explain the positron excess in the galactic center observed by INTEGRAL, excess gamma rays from the galactic center  and extragalactic sources. It has also been suggested that light dark matter may explain a small discrepancy in the measured value of the fine structure constant in different experiments. Such as using binding crystals with alchemy trying to catch a light bases source code written in mutli-code from 1 to a trillion produced by the sun trying to reprogram the mass of an object causing a holographic computing based on sun fluctuations, suspending it in animation creating anti-gravity making things lighter then they seem.
