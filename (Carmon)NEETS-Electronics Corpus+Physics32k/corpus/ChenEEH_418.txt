The ﬁnite value of the op-amp’s gain-bandwidth product vt
causes the frequency range of the active ﬁlters discussed so far
to be limited to approximately 0:1 vt. Using inexpensive op-
amps in which f t is of the order 1.5 to 3 MHz is not sufﬁcient
because the frequency range is too low for most communi-
cations applications. Although relatively economical wide-
band ampliﬁers are available with f t values up to about
100 MHz, a different solution is available that is especially
attractive for ﬁlter circuits compatible with integrated-circuit
(IC) technology. For these cases, gain is not obtained from
operational voltage ampliﬁers but from operational transcon-
ductance ampliﬁers, also labeled OTAs or transconductors.
These circuits are voltage-to-current converters characterized
by their transconductance parameter g m that relates the output
current to the (normally differential) input voltage:
