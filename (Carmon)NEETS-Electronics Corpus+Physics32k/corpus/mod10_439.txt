A transmission line is electrically long when its physical length is long compared to a quarter-
wavelength of the energy it is to carry. You must understand that the terms "short" and "long" are relative
ones. For example, a line that has a physical length of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet) is considered
quite short electrically if it transmits a radio frequency of 30 kilohertz. On the other hand, the same
transmission line is considered electrically long if it transmits a frequency of 30,000 megahertz.
