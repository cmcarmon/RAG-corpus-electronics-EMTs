Up to this point, we have discussed the number of degrees a rotor is turned. Now, it is important to 
point out the labeling of synchro positions. Labeling is necessary to determine the actual position of the 
synchro's rotor. Notice that synchro rotor positions are labeled from 0ยบ, increasing in a counterclockwise 
direction. It is common practice to refer to a synchro transmitter as being on 120ยบ when its rotor is 
pointing toward the S3 winding. Do not confuse these positions with the number of degrees a rotor is 
turned.
