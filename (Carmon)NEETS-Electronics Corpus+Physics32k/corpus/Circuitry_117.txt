coil/inductor  will  result  in  an  induced  voltage 
appearing  across  it.  The  unit  of  inductance  is  the 
henry (H) and a coil is said to have an inductance 
of 1H if a voltage of 1V is induced across it when a 
current changing at the rate of 1 A/s is flowing in it. 
  The  voltage  induced  across  the  terminals  of  an 
inductor will thus be proportional to the product of 
the inductance (L) and the rate of change of applied 
current. Hence: 
 
e = (cid:1)L Ã— (rate of change of current) 
 
Note  that  the  minus  sign  indicates  the  polarity  of 
the voltage, i.e. opposition to the change. 
  The rate of change of current is often represented 
by  the expression di/dt  where di represents a  very 
small  change  in  current  and  dt  represents  the 
corresponding  small  change 
time.  Using 
mathematical notation to write this we arrive at:
