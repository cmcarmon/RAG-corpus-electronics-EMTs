(OFCCs). OFCCs are a tight-buffered fiber surrounded by arimid yarn and a low-halogen outer jacket.
The OFCC outer diameter is typically 2 millimeters (mm). The fiber is typically buffered with a polyester
elastomer to a total diameter of 900 m m. Figure 3-14 illustrates the design of the OFCCs. The size of the
OFCCs limits the amount of fibers contained within an OFCC cable. An OFCC cable generally contains
less than 36 fibers (OFCCs). An OFCC cable of 0.5-inch cable outer diameter can accommodate about 12
fibers.
