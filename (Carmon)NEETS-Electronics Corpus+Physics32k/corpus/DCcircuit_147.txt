In an open circuit, where voltage is present between the terminals of the source and there
is zero current, there is zero power dissipated, no matter how great that voltage may be. Since
P=IE and I=0 and anything multiplied by zero is zero, the power dissipated in any open circuit
must be zero. Likewise, if we were to have a short circuit constructed of a loop of supercon-
ducting wire (absolutely zero resistance), we could have a condition of current in the loop with
zero voltage, and likewise no power would be dissipated. Since P=IE and E=0 and anything
multiplied by zero is zero, the power dissipated in a superconducting loop must be zero. (Weâ€™ll
be exploring the topic of superconductivity in a later chapter).
