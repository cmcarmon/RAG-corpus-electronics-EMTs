The Rjk is the crosscorrelation of signal j and signal k. If the left
inverse of L21 exists, then the subsystem correlation functions
can be determined and used to identify the subsystems via
standard identiÔ¨Åcation techniques. However, in general, this
left inverse does not exist and either the type information or
the psuedo-inverse of L21 must be used to yield subsystem
models.
