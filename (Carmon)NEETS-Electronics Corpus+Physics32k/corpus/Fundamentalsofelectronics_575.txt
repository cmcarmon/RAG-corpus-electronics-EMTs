5.5.7 Discrete-Time Systems
Discrete-time systems can act on discrete-time signals in ways similar to those found in analog signals and
systems. Because of the role of software in discrete-time systems, many more diﬀerent systems can be
envisioned and “constructed” with programs than can be with analog signals.
In fact, a special class of
analog signals can be converted into discrete-time signals, processed with software, and converted back into
an analog signal, all without the incursion of error. For such signals, systems can be easily produced in
software, with equivalent analog realizations diﬃcult, if not impossible, to design.

The Fourier transform of the discrete-time signal s (n) is deﬁned to be
