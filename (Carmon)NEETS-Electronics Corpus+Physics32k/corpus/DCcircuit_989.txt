We take a second look at the “mesh current method” with all the currents running counter-
clockwise (ccw). The motivation is to simplify the writing of mesh equations by ignoring the
resistor voltage drop polarity. Though, we must pay attention to the polarity of voltage sources
with respect to assumed current direction. The sign of the resistor voltage drops will follow a
ﬁxed pattern.
