The discriminators are calibrated with the transmitters. The subcarrier frequency, which is the input to the
discriminator,  is  monitored  with  a  digital  counter  as  the  calibration  beam  is  loaded.  The  voltage  output
corresponding to the frequency change can be monitored with a vacuum tube voltmeter. The strain, subcarrier
frequency change, and the voltage output of the discriminator are then correlated. A digital frequency counter
is used to set the transmitter center frequency.
