that  the  component  is  up  at  time  t  and  reliability  R(t)  is  the  probability  that  the  system  has  continuously
operated from 0 to t. Thus, R(t) is much more stringent than A(t). While both R(0) and A(0) are unity, R(t)
drops off rapidly as compared to A(t) as time progresses. With a small value of MTTR (or large value of m), it
is possible to realize a very high availability for a repairable component.
