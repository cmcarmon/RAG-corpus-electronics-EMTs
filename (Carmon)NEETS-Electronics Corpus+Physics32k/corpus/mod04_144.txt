Wires to be soldered to connectors should be stripped so that when the wire is placed in the barrel, 
there will be a gap of approximately 1/32 inch between the end of the barrel and the end of the insulation. 
This is done to prevent burning the insulation during the soldering process and to allow the wire to flex 
easier at a stress point. Before copper wires are soldered to connectors, the ends exposed by stripping are 
tinned to hold the strands solidly together. The tinning operation is satisfactory when the ends and sides 
of the wire strands are fused together with a coat of solder. Do not tin wires that are to be crimped to 
solderless terminals or splices.
