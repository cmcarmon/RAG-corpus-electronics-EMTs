The optical source launches the optical signal into the fiber. The optical signal will become
progressively weakened and distorted because of scattering, absorption, and dispersion mechanisms in the
fiber waveguides. Chapter 2 discusses the fiber mechanisms of scattering, absorption, and dispersion.
Chapter 3 discusses the types of optical fibers and cables.
