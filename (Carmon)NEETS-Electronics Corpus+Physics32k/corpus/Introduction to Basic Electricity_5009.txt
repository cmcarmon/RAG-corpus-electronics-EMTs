Guidelines for laying out traces are shown in  
Figure 48-18. Try to limit using angles of 90Â° in traces. 
They leave a point that causes problems by acting like 
a one-turn inductor. Additionally, the point will not be 
well supported and will easily lift off the base material 
of a printed circuit board.
