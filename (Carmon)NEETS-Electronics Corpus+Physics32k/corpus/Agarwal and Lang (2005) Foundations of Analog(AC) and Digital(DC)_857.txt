Silicon doped with a material rich in electrons is called an n-type semicon-
ductor. Similarly, silicon doped with a material rich in holes is called a p-type
semiconductor. As the word ‘‘semiconductor’’ implies, silicon doped with either
n-type or p-type material is a fairly good conductor of electricity. We use the
notation n
to refer to silicon that is heavily doped with n-type or p-type
material, respectively. n
type semiconductors are even better conduc-
tors. We commonly refer to n-type or p-type doped silicon areas as diffusion
regions.
