As the generator potential again decreases toward zero, the antenna begins to discharge and the 
electrostatic field begins to collapse. When the generator potential reaches zero, discharge current is 
maximum and the associated magnetic field is maximum. A brief time later, generator potential reverses, 
and the condition shown in view B recurs.
