Next, inspect junction A between resistors R3 and 
R4. At this point, there is current summing or addi-
tion. There is 10 mA of current flowing through R4, 
and it is joined or summed with 150 mA of current 
through the 3-volt load, RL3. This means that a total of 
160 mA of current is flowing through resistor R3.
