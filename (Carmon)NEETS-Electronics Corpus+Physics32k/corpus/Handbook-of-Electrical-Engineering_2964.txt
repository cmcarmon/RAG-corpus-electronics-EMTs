In  an  ampliﬁer  system,  the  last  stage  of  a  voltage  ampliﬁer  string  has  to  be  considered  as  a  large  signal
ampliﬁer, and generally EF ampliﬁers are used as large signal ampliﬁers. This then requires that the dc bias or
dc operating point (quiescent point) be located near the center of the load line in order to get the maximum
output voltage swing. Small signal analysis can be used to evaluate the ampliﬁer for voltage gain, current gain,
input impedance, and output impedance, all of which are discussed later.
