A low-resolution radar views a target as a single point. There-
fore, most targets to the low-resolution radar are point targets
with different RCS or echo powers. When a high-resolution
radar views the same target, it sees many scattering points and
information about the targets, such as sizes,
features, or
images, that can be extracted from the received echoes.
