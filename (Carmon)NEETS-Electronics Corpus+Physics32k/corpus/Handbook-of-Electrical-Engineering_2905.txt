Parts  placement  likewise  may  be  as  simple  as  tweezers  and  may  progress  to  hand-held  vacuum  probes  to
allow easier handling of the components. As mentioned in the Section 26.9, Xâ€“Y arm/tables are available which
have vacuum-pick nozzles to allow the operator to pick a part from a tray, reel, or stick, and move the part
over the correct location on the substrate. The part is then moved down into the solder paste, the vacuum is
turned off manually or automatically, and the nozzle is raised away from the substrate.
