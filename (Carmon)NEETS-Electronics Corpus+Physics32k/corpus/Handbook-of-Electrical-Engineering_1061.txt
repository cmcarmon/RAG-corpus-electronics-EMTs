As terms are added to the Fourier series expansion, the orthogonality of the basis functions guarantees that
the error decreases monotonically in the mean-squared sense, i.e., that mseN monotonically decreases as N is
increased. Therefore, when applying Fourier series analysis, including more terms always improves the accuracy
of the signal representation.
