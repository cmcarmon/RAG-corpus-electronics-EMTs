. The removable hard disk has been at work in the main-
frame computer industry since the 1950s. Back then, the
drive mechanism was extremely expensive; therefore, dif-
ferent applications would use different removable disks,
during program execution. In the 1980s, removable hard
drive was used for backup purposes. The capacity then
was 44 MB. Nowadays, removable disks come in various
capacities from one gigabyte up to several gigabytes.
