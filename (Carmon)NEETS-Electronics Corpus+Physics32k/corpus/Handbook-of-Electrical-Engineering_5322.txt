A typical example of developments in thermionics is the TFE (thermionic fuel element) that integrates the
converter and nuclear fuel for space nuclear power in the kW to MW level for very long (7 to 10 years) duration
missions. Another niche is the thermionic cogeneration burner module, a high-temperature burner equipped
with thermionic converters. Electrical outputs of 50 kW/MW of thermal output have been achieved. High (600
°
C) heat rejection temperatures of thermionic converters are ideally suited for producing ﬂue gas in the
to 650
°
C range for industrial processes. A long-range goal is to use thermionic converters as toppers for
500 to 550
conventional power plants. Such concepts are not economical at present.
