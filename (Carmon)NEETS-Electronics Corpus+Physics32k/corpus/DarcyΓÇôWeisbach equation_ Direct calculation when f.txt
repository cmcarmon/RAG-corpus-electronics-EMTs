In typical engineering applications, there will be a set of given or known quantities. The acceleration of gravity g and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ν are known, as are the diameter of the pipe D and its roughness height ε. If as well the head loss per unit length S is a known quantity, then the friction factor fD can be calculated directly from the chosen fitting function. Solving the Darcy–Weisbach equation for √fD,

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {f_{\mathrm {D} }}}={\frac {\sqrt {2gSD}}{\langle v\rangle }}}

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} {\sqrt {f_{\mathrm {D} }}}={\frac {1}{\nu }}{\sqrt {2g}}{\sqrt {S}}{\sqrt {D^{3}}}}

we have the two parameters needed to substitute into the Colebrook–White relation, or any other function, for the friction factor fD, the flow velocity ⟨v⟩, and the volumetric flow rate Q.
