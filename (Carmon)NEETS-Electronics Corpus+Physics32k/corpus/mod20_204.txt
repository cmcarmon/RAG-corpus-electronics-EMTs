E-TRANSFORMERÂ—A special form of differential transformer employing an E-shaped core. The 
secondaries of the transformer are wound on the outer legs of the E, and the primary is wound on the 
center leg. An output voltage is developed across the secondary coils when its armature is displaced 
from its neutral position. This device is used as an error detector in servosystems that have limited load 
movements [15].
