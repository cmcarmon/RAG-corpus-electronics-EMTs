Remember that electrons can ﬂow only when they have the opportunity to move in the
space between the atoms of a material. This means that there can be electric current only
where there exists a continuous path of conductive material providing a conduit for electrons
to travel through. In the marble analogy, marbles can ﬂow into the left-hand side of the tube
(and, consequently, through the tube) if and only if the tube is open on the right-hand side for
marbles to ﬂow out. If the tube is blocked on the right-hand side, the marbles will just ”pile
up” inside the tube, and marble ”ﬂow” will not occur. The same holds true for electric current:
the continuous ﬂow of electrons requires there be an unbroken path to permit that ﬂow. Let’s
look at a diagram to illustrate how this works:
