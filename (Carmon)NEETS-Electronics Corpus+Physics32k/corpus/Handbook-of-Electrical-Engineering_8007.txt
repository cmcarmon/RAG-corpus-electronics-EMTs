P chip may have
the ones used by various control lines and mode selections for the processor. Hence, a given 
four or more modes of operation: it is simply cheaper to build a ﬂexible system, rather than several different ones.

Ps possess a richness of data access means (addressing modes); they support many
different ways of working with memory and external data items. They are complex instruction set computers
(CISC). A prime example is the Motorola 68000 with ﬁve data groupings and nine addressing modes.
