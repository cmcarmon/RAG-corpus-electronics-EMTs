Ohm’s Law is useful in analyzing voltage and 
current  for  resistors  and  other  components 
that behave like resistors, such as light bulbs. 
But  you  have  to  be  careful  about  applying 
Ohm’s  Law  to  other  electronic  components, 
such as capacitors (detailed in Chapter 7) and 
inductors (covered in Chapter 8), which don’t
