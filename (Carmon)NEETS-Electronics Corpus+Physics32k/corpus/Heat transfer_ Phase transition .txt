Phase transition or phase change, takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The Mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation.
Phase transitions involve the four fundamental states of matter:
Solid – Deposition, freezing and solid to solid transformation.
Gas – Boiling / evaporation, recombination / deionization, and sublimation.
Liquid – Condensation and melting / fusion.
Plasma – Ionization.
