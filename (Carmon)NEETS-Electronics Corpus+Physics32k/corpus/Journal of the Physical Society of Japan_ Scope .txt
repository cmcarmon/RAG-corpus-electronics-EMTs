The main focus of JPSJ is all topics related to physics. This includes pure and applied physics research topics which encompass core physics disciplines, and broad topical coverage that is related to these core disciplines. Hence, subject areas cover an exploration and investigation of nature and substances that exist in the world and the universe, from atomic to cosmological scales. This encompasses defining and describing observations, interactions, and forces which occur in nature and, hence, in substances. Such descriptions may include their effect on, or within, a given natural system. More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves. Therefore, subject areas encompass energy, forces, mechanics, radiation, heat, matter, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and general theory of relativity.
