Under ideal conditions of a perfectly spherical central body and zero perturbations, all orbital elements except the mean anomaly are constants. The mean anomaly changes linearly with time, scaled by the mean motion,

Hence if at any instant t0 the orbital parameters are [e0, a0, i0, Ω0, ω0, M0], then the elements at time t0 + δt is given by [e0, a0, i0, Ω0, ω0, M0 + n δt]
