Robotics  and  Automation  Corporationâ€™s
CFD  line  includes  three  end-of-arm  devices
and two bench-mounted devices. They do not
require  that  the  robot  apply  and  control  the
force, only that it move along a normal pro-
grammed path over the work piece; the CFD
applies and maintains the required processing
pressure.
