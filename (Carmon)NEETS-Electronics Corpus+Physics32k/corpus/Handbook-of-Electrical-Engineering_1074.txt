Relationship between the CT and DT Spectra
Since DT signals often originate by sampling a CT signal, it is important to develop the relationship between
the original spectrum of the CT signal and the spectrum of the DT signal that results. First, the CT Fourier
transform is applied to the CT sampling model, and the properties are used to produce the following result:
