board. Pay close attention to installing ICs on the 
printed circuit board to ensure that pin 1 is lined up 
with its appropriate location on the board. Use ¼-inch 
leg warmers on LEDs and small transistors to avoid 
overheating (Figure 49-15). After the component leads 
have been inserted, they should be bent to a 45° angle 
to keep them from falling out before soldering.
