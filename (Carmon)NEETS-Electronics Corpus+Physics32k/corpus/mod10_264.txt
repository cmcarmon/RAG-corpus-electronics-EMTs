equator. Virtually all weather phenomena take place in the troposphere. The temperature in this region 
decreases rapidly with altitude, clouds form, and there may be much turbulence because of variations in 
temperature, density, and pressure. These conditions have a great effect on the propagation of radio 
waves, which will be explained later in this chapter.
