Notice the ”+” and ”-” signs drawn at the ends of the break in the circuit, and how they
correspond to the ”+” and ”-” signs next to the battery’s terminals. These markers indicate the
direction that the voltage attempts to push electron ﬂow, that potential direction commonly
referred to as polarity. Remember that voltage is always relative between two points. Because
of this fact, the polarity of a voltage drop is also relative between two points: whether a point
in a circuit gets labeled with a ”+” or a ”-” depends on the other point to which it is referenced.
Take a look at the following circuit, where each corner of the loop is marked with a number for
reference:
