Example of Calculation of Pulse Propagation in a Two-
Dimensional Grid
Figure 9.9 presents an example of the calculation of a radially
outward-propagating cylindrical wave in a two-dimensional
TMz grid. A 360  360 – cell square grid with Dx ¼ Dy ¼
D ¼ 1:0 is used in this example. The grid is numerically excited
at its center point by applying a unit-step time-function to a
single Ez ﬁeld component. We assume the Courant factor
S ¼
=2, which yields dispersionless propagation for numer-
2
ical plane-wave modes propagating along the grid diagonals
f ¼ 45, 135, 225, and 315. In Figure 9.9(A), we graph
snapshots of the Ez distribution versus radial distance from
the source. Here, ﬁeld observations are made along cuts
through the grid passing through the source and either parallel
to the principal grid axes f ¼ 0, 90 or parallel to the grid
diagonal f ¼ 45. The snapshots are taken 232Dt after the
beginning of time-stepping. At this time, the wave has not
yet reached the outer grid boundary.
