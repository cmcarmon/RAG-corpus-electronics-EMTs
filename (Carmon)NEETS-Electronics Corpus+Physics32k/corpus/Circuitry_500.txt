  With  both  links  in  place  (i.e.  SET  =  0  and 
RESET  =  0)  observe  and  record  (using  a  truth 
table)  the state of the outputs.   
  Remove the RESET link (to make RESET = 1) 
whilst leaving the SET link in place (to keep SET = 
0). Once again, observe and record the state of the 
outputs. Replace the RESET link (to make RESET 
= 0)  and  check  that  the  bistable  does  not  change
