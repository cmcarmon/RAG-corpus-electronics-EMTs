In Terms of RMS Values and Phase Difference
Consider  the  question  from  another  point  of  view.  The  preceding  equation  shows  the  power  to  consist  of  a
constant term and a sinusoid. The average value of a sinusoid is zero, so this term will contribute nothing to
the net energy transmitted. Only the constant term will contribute. This constant term is the average value of
the power, as can be seen either from the preceding ﬁgure or by integrating the preceding equation over one
cycle. Denoting the average power by P and letting q = a – b, which is the angle of the network impedance,
the average power becomes:
