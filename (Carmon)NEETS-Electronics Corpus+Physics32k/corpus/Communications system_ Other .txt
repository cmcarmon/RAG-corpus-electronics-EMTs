Some common pairs of input and output transducers include:
microphones and speakers (audio signals)
keyboards and computer monitors
cameras and liquid crystal displays (LCD's)
force sensors (buttons) and lights or motors
Again, input transducers convert non-electric signals like voice into electric signals that can be transmitted over great distances very quickly. Output transducers convert the electric signal back into sound or picture, etc... There are many different types of transducers and the combinations are limitless.
