Many  signals  contain  harmonic  components  (i.e. 
signals at 2f, 3f, 4f, etc. where f is the frequency of 
the  fundamental  signal).  To  reproduce  a  square 
wave,  for  example,  requires  an  amplifier  with  a 
very  wide  bandwidth  (note  that  a  square  wave 
comprises an infinite series of harmonics). Clearly 
it is not possible to perfectly reproduce such a wave 
but  it  does  explain  why  it  can  be  desirable  for  an 
amplifierâ€™s bandwidth to greatly exceed the highest 
signal frequency that it is required to handle!
