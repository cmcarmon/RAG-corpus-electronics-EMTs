Example 1.10 
 
A voltage  of  3.75  × 10(cid:1)6 V appears at the input of 
an amplifier. Express this voltage in (a) V and (b) 
mV, using exponent notation. 
 
Solution 
 
(a) 1 × 10(cid:1)6 V = 1 µV so 3.75 × 10(cid:1)6 V = 3.75 µV 
(b) There are 1,000 µV in 1 mV so we must divide 
the previous result by 1,000 in order to express 
the voltage in mV. So 3.75 µV = 0.00375 mV.
