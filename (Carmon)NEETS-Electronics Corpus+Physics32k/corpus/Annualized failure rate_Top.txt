Annualized failure rate (AFR) gives the estimated probability that a device or component will fail during a full year of use. It is a relation between the mean time between failure (MTBF) and the hours that a number of devices are run per year. AFR is estimated from a sample of like componentsâ€”AFR and MTBF as given by vendors are population statistics that can not predict the behaviour of an individual unit. Racy
