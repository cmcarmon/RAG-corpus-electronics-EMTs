The protection of transmission lines varies in the principle
used and the implementation approaches taken, depending
on the voltage level. The main principles and associated im-
plementation issues are discussed for the following most fre-
quent transmission line protective relaying cases: overcurrent
protection of distribution radial feeders, distance protection of
transmission lines and associated relaying schemes, and differ-
ential protection of transmission lines. Detailed treatment of
the subject may be found in an excellent recent IEEE survey of
the subject (IEEE, 1999).
