Aperture	–	it	is	in	charge	of	gathering	visual	aids,	then,	modifying	these
tools	for	a	clear	display	of	retrievable	information	from	a	particular
electronic	device
Deflector	plates	–	it	accepts,	interprets,	then,	measures	receivable	data;
initially,	it	acknowledges	all	information	prior	to	the	screening	of	the
unnecessary	ones
Extractor	–	it	is	in	charge	of	drawing	out	information	from	an	electronic
device,	then,	transferring	them	to	the	hacking	mechanism
Lens	–	it	is	in	charge	of	making	adjustments	to	assist	when	processing
information
Octupoles	–	it	is	also	known	as	double	quadrupoles	or	octopoles,	which
means	something	that	has	eight	poles;	it	controls	beams	of	ions
Suppressor	–	it	is	designed	to	prevent	power	overload	due	to	voltage
spikes;	it	works	by	regulating	the	amount	of	electric	current	within	a
system	so	a	device	can	remain	functional
