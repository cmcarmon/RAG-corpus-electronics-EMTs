An operating system is just another program running on a computer. It is unlike any other program, however.
An operating systemâ€™s primary function is the management of all hardware and software resources. It manages
of  one  program  from
processors,  memory,  I/O  devices,  and  networks.  It  enforces  policies  such  as 
to ensure that users have equal access to system resources. It is privileged in that it is the
another and 
only program that can perform specialized hardware operations. The operating system is the primary program
upon which all other programs rely.
