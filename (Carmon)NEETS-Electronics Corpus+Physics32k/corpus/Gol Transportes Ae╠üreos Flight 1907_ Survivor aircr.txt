N600XL remained impounded at Cachimbo for almost three years, but in mid-2009 American company General Aviation Services agreed to buy the aircraft. The company partnered with Gantt Aviation and Constant Aviation to check and prepare it for its ferry to the US. Constant completed the work and finally on 19 November 2010 (more than 4 years after the accident) the aircraft, now with the new registration of N965LL, arrived at Cleveland International Airport to be refurbished and put up for sale.
The plane was reported to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. The plane was then sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.
