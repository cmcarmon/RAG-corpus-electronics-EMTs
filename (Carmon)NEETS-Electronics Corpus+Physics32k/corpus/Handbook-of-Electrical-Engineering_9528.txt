Transactions originating from different users may be aimed at the same database records. This situation, if
not carefully monitored, may cause the database to become inconsistent. Starting from a database in a consistent
state, it is obvious that if all transactions are executed one after the other, then the database will remain in a
consistent state. In a multiuser DBMS, serial execution of transactions is wasteful of system resources. In this
case, the solution is to interleave the execution of the transactions. However, the interleaving of transactions
has  to  be  performed  in  a  way  that  prevents  the  database  from  becoming  inconsistent.  Suppose  that  two
transactions T1 and T2 proceed in the following way:
