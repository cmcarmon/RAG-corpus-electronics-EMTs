Demodulation and Decoding
Demodulation consists of the inverse of the modulation process. Standard techniques are used to demodulate
the phase-modulated or QAM signals. Also included in the demodulation process is equalization. The decoding
process converts the run-length encoded information to a series of 1s and 0s corresponding to the black and
white pels of the image. The demodulated and decoded signal is then used to control the recording of the image.
