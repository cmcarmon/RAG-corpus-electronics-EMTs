Integrated into the MEMS accelerometers from Analog
Devices are capacitor structures that act as electrostatic actu-
ators. When a voltage is applied to them, the moving part of
the device deﬂects, which produces a signal similar to that
generated by an input acceleration of a speciﬁc value. This
feature enables a built-in test capability that allows the device
to automatically assay its performance. This is an example of
the melding of actuators into MEMS devices that are made
for sensing.
