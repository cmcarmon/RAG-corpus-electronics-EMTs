where J is the cost criterion and where the subscript k on E
denotes the expectation based on a control law k generating the
control action u(t) from the state x(t) or from a measurement
history arising from that state. By means of a Lagrange multi-
plier m corresponding to the constraint of equation 5.13, one
can form the function:
