Associated with every charged body there is an electrostatic field. Bodies that are charged alike repel
one another and bodies with unlike charges attract each other. An electron will be affected by an
electrostatic field in exactly the same manner as any negatively charged body. It is repelled by a negative
charge and attracted by a positive charge. If a conductor has a difference in potential impressed across it,
as shown in figure 1-25, a direction is imparted to the random drift. This causes the mobile electrons to be
repelled away from the negative terminal and attracted toward the positive terminal. This constitutes a
general migration of electrons from one end of the conductor to the other. The directed migration of
mobile electrons due to the potential difference is called DIRECTED DRIFT.
