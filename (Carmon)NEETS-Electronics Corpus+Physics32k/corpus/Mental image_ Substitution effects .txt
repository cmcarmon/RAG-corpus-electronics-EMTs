Mental imagery can act as a substitute for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented.
Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence.
Mental practice can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice.
Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption.
Imagined goal achievement can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.
