Some radio transmitters, when operating in the AM mode, must be adjusted for correct modulation 
during normal tuning procedures. If the modulation level is low, the transmitter is not operating at its 
maximum efficiency. On the other hand, modulation in excess of 100% produces serious distortion. Since 
neither of these conditions is desirable, amplitude modulation should be maintained between 60% and 
95% when possible. The modulation level or index of AM and fm radio transmitters that operate in the 
vhf range is initially adjusted by the manufacturer or during corrective maintenance. The amplifier gain of 
the modulator can be initially adjusted by reference to the modulation meter provided on the front panel 
of the equipment.
