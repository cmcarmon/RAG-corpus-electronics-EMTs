The RTÉ Programme Classification (known as the On Screen Classification) is a rating system for television programmes or films in Ireland. Viewers on RTÉ One and RTÉ Two will have seen a rating that a programme has been given at the top right hand corner of their screens. The icons appear for about 20 seconds at the start of a programme or film, usually excluding the news. This signals the beginning of a unique initiative which will see RTÉ gradually move to a situation where most programmes will be classified as to content.
The System is an information service to television viewers, letting them know more about the content of scheduled programmes so that they can make informed decisions to view or not to view. Children's and young adult's programmes will be labeled as such. Programmes with explicit sex or violence is more suited to a mature audience, which will not merely be scheduled until after the 9pm watershed, but will be flagged on screen.
