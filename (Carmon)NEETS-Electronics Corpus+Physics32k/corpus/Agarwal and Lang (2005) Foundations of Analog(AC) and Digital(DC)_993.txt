(7.36)
From Equation 7.26, we know that VT = 1 V is at the low end of the valid input
range. The corresponding value of vO is VS = 5 V and the current iD is 0.
Next, to obtain the highest value of the input voltage for saturation region operation of
the MOSFET amplifier we substitute the values of these parameters in Equation 7.32.
