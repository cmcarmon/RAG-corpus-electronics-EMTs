A variation of the desoldering bulb is a spring-
loaded desoldering  pump (Figure 49-22) that 
works by depressing a plunger until it locks. To suck 
up solder, press the release button. The spring forces 
the plunger up rapidly, creating a vacuum. The com-
bination rubber bulb and soldering iron uses a hollow 
tip to suck up the solder (Figure 49-23), thus eliminat-
ing the rush to get the solder sucker to the pad before 
the solder rehardens.
