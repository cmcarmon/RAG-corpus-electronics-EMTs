For the case of constant acceleration, the differential equation Eq 1) can be integrated as the acceleration vector A of a point P is constant in magnitude and direction. Such a point is said to undergo uniformly accelerated motion. In this case, the velocity V(t) and then the trajectory P(t) of the particle can be obtained by integrating the acceleration equation A with respect to time.
Assuming that the initial conditions of the position,





P


0




{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{0}}
, and velocity





V


0




{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{0}}
are known, the first integration yields the velocity of the particle as a function of time.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} (t)=\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {A} dt=\mathbf {A} t+\mathbf {V} _{0}.}

Additional relations between displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be derived. Since the acceleration is constant,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} ={\frac {\Delta \mathbf {V} }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\mathbf {V} -\mathbf {V} _{0}}{t}}}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} (t)=\mathbf {P} _{0}+\left({\frac {\mathbf {V} +\mathbf {V} _{0}}{2}}\right)t.}

A relationship between velocity, position and acceleration without explicit time dependence can be had by solving the average acceleration for time and substituting and simplifying

The dot can be replaced by the cosine of the angle

In the case of acceleration always in the direction of the motion, the angle between the vectors (

This reduces the parametric equations of motion of the particle to a cartesian relationship of speed versus position. This relation is useful when time is not known explicitly.
