The changing face of the communication industry was started
with the marriage of computer and communication technolo-
gies in 1984 when AT&T was divided into seven Regional Bell
Operation Companies (RBOC). The change has shaped the
fabrics of society. Paper mail to electronic mail, shopping
mode to online shopping, and libraries to digital
libraries
have changed day-to-day life. All the changes are the results
of advanced communication and networking technologies. In
this section, we explain the concepts and terms that will help
the reader understand different communication and network-
ing technologies described in the later subsections.
