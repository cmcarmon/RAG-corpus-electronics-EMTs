Cosmetic metaforms use "human body action, artful movement, shape, ornament and decoration, and even ingestion of meaningful foods," to depict methods of organization of the world. Cosmetic metaforms are the ways in which menstruation rites were made visible upon women's bodies, through various forms of modifications. For many cultures, cosmetic expression after the conclusion of menstrual seclusion was a very specific way of displaying a woman's unique knowledge gained through her experience. Some metaforms were expressed through temporary modifications like painting or dying, while others were more permanent modifications like tattoos, scarification, and embedded objects.
