When a block is brought into the cache, it is likely that another block must be evicted. The selection of the
evicted block is based on some attempt to capture temporal locality. Since prescience is so difÔ¨Åcult to achieve,
other methods are generally used to predict future memory accesses. A least-recently-used (LRU) policy is often
the basis for the choice. Other replacement policies are sometimes used, particularly because true LRU replace-
ment requires extensive logic and bookkeeping.
