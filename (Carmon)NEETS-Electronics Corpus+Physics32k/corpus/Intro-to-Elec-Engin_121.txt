Systems such as those encountered in mechanics, thermodynamics, and hydraulics can be repre-
sented by analogous electric networks, from the response of which the system characteristics can
be investigated. The analogy, of course, is a mathematical one: that is, two systems are analogous
to each other if they are described by similar equations. The analogous electric quantities for a
mechanical system are listed in Table 1.5.1.
Consider a tank ﬁlled with water, as shown in Figure 1.5.1, with input ﬂow rate Fi and output
ﬂow rate Fo = h/R, where h is the ﬂuid level or head and R is related to the diameter of the
pipe, denoting the ﬂuid resistance. Let A be the cross-sectional area of the tank. We may think of
the ﬂuid as being analogous to charge, and the ﬂuid ﬂow as being analogous to current. Then, in
effect, the water tank acts as a capacitor storing charge, which is ﬂuid in this case. This analogy
is illustrated in Table 1.5.2.
