The superposition of two layers with identically inclined lines forms moiré lines inclined at the same angle. Figure 5 is obtained from Figure 1 with a vertical shearing. In Figure 5 the layer lines and the moiré lines are inclined by 10 degrees. Since the inclination is not a rotation, during the inclination the distance (p) between the layer lines along the vertical axis is conserved, but the true distance (T) between the lines (along an axis perpendicular to these lines) is changed. The difference between the vertical periods pb, pr, and the distances Tb, Tr is shown in the diagram of Figure 8.

The inclination degree of layer lines may change along the horizontal axis forming curves. The superposition of two layers with identical inclination pattern forms moiré curves with the same inclination pattern. In Figure 6 the inclination degree of layer lines gradually changes according to the following sequence of degrees (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30). Layer periods pb and pr represent the distances between the curves along the vertical axis. The presented formulas for computing the period pm (the vertical distance between the moiré curves) and the optical speedup (along the vertical axis) are valid for Figure 6.

More interesting is the case when the inclination degrees of layer lines are not the same for the base and revealing layers. Figure 7 shows an animation of a superposition images where the inclination degree of base layer lines is constant (10 degrees), but the inclination of the revealing layer lines oscillates between 5 and 15 degrees. The periods of layers along the vertical axis pb and pr are the same all the time. Correspondingly, the period pm (along the vertical axis) computed with the basic formula also remains the same.

Figure 8 helps to compute the inclination degree of moiré optical lines as a function of the inclination of the revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The bold lines of the diagram inclined by αb degrees are the base layer lines. The bold lines inclined by αr degrees are the revealing layer lines. The base layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to pb, and the revealing layer lines are vertically spaced by a distance equal to pr. The distances Tb and Tr represent the true space between the base layer and revealing layer lines, correspondingly. The intersections of the lines of the base and the revealing layers (marked in the figure by two arrows) lie on a central axis of a light moiré band. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis of the light moiré band. The inclination degree of moiré lines is therefore the inclination αm of the dashed line.
From Figure 8 we deduce the following two equations:

From these equations we deduce the equation for computing the inclination of moiré lines as a function of the inclinations of the base layer and the revealing layer lines:
