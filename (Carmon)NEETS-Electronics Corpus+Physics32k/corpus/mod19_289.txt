â€¢ An alteration-equivalent-to-repair (AER) could be one of three types. One involves substitution, 
without change in design, of approved, different material, available from standard stock. The 
second involves replacement of worn or damaged parts, assemblies, or equipment with those of 
later and more efficient design that have been approved by the responsible systems command. 
The last type is used for strengthening of parts that need repair or replacement to improve the 
reliability of the parts, provided no other change in design is involved.
