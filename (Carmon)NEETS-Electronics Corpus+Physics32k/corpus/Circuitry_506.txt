Microprocessor systems 
 
Microprocessor systems are usually assembled on a 
single  PCB  comprising  a  microprocessor  CPU 
together  with  a  number  of  specialized  support 
chips.  These  very  large  scale  integrated  (VLSI) 
devices  provide  input  and  output  to  the  system, 
control and timing as well as storage for programs 
and data.  
  Typical applications for microprocessor systems 
include the control of complex industrial processes. 
Typical  examples  are  based  on  families  of  chips 
such  as  the  Z80CPU  plus  Z80PIO,  Z80CTC,  and 
Z80SIO.
