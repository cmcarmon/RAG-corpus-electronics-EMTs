CIRCUIT OPERATION AT RESONANCE.â€”The operation of the Foster-Seeley discriminator
can best be explained using vector diagrams [figure 3-11, view (B)] that show phase relationships
between the voltages and currents in the circuit. Let's look at the phase relationships when the input
frequency is equal to the center frequency of the resonant tank circuit.
