According to Goldschmidt classification, Lu and Hf are both lithophile elements (earth-loving elements), meaning they are mainly found in the silicate fraction of Earth, i.e. the mantle and crust. During early Earth formation, the two elements tend not be fractionated into the core during core formation, i.e. not concentrated in the core, unlike siderophile elements (iron-loving elements). Lu and Hf are also refractory elements, meaning they quickly condensate during early Earth formation to form the solid part of Earth, as oppose to volatile elements. The two elements as a result would not be found in early Earth atmosphere and be expelled from Earth. Due to these characteristics, the two elements are relatively stationary through planetary evolution and are thought to retain isotopic abundance characteristics of primitive planetary material, i.e. chondritic uniform reservoir (CHUR).
Both Lu and Hf are incompatible trace elements, and relatively immobile. However, Hf is more incompatible than Lu, thus is enriched relatively in crust and silicate melts. Thus, a higher Lu/Hf ratio (also meaning a higher 176Hf / 177Hf ratio) would usually be achieved in the residue solid after melting and removal of liquid from that particular reservoir. It is worth noting that the variation of Lu/Hf ratio is usually very small.
