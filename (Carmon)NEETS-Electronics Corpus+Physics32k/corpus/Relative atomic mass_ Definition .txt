Relative atomic mass is determined by the average atomic mass, or the weighted mean of the atomic masses of all the atoms of a particular chemical element found in a particular sample, which is then compared to the atomic mass of carbon-12. This comparison is the quotient of the two weights, which makes the value dimensionless (no unit appended). This quotient also explains the word relative: the sample mass value is made relative to carbon-12.
It is a synonym for atomic weight (and is not to be confused with relative isotopic mass). Relative atomic mass is frequently used as a synonym for the standard atomic weight and these will have overlapping values if the relative atomic mass used is that for an element from Earth under defined conditions. However, relative atomic mass (atomic weight) covers more than standard atomic weights, and is more general term that may more broadly refer to non-terrestrial environments and highly specific terrestrial environments that deviate from Earth-average or have different certainties (number of significant figures) than do the standard atomic weights.
