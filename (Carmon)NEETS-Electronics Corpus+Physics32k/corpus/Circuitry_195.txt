Inductive reactance 
 
The reactance of an inductor is defined as the ratio 
of applied voltage to current and, like resistance, it 
is measured in ohms. The reactance of an inductor   
is  directly  proportional  to  both  the  value  of 
inductance  and 
the  applied 
voltage.  Inductive  reactance  can  be  found  by 
applying the formula: 
 
XL = 20 f L
where XL is the reactance in F, f is the frequency in 
Hz, and L is the inductance in H. 
 
linearly  with 
frequency  as  shown  in  Fig.  4.8.  The  applied 
voltage, VL, and current, IL, developed across a pure 
inductive reactance will differ in phase by an angle 
of  90Â°  or  0/2 radians  (the  current  lags  the 
voltage).  This  relationship  is  illustrated  in  the 
current  and  voltage  waveforms  (drawn 
to  a 
common  time  scale)  shown  in  Fig.  4.9  and  as  a 
phasor diagram shown in Fig. 4.10.
