1. Carrier-to-carrier interactions are considered to be very weak.
2. Particles cannot gain energy from the electric ﬁeld during collision.
3. Scattering probability is independent of the electric ﬁeld.
4. Magnetic ﬁeld effects are neglected.
5. No electron-to-electron interaction occurs in the collision term.
6. Electric ﬁeld varies very slowly, i.e., electric ﬁeld is considered constant for a wave packet describing the
