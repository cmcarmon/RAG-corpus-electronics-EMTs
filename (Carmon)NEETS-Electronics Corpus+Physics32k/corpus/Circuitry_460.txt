Time for which a multivibrator output is ‘high’: 
(page 175) 
 
T1 = 0.7 C2 R4
Time for which a multivibrator output is ‘low’: 
(page 175) 
 
T2 = 0.7 C1 R3
Periodic time for the output of a square wave 
mutivibrator: 
(pages 175 and 176) 
 
T = 0.7 (C2 R4 + C1 R3) 
 
when C = C1 = C2 and R = R3 = R4
T = 1.4 C R
Periodic time for the output of a single-stage 
astable oscillator:
