Today many devices use operational amplifiers. Operational amplifiers are used as d.c. amplifiers,
a.c. amplifiers, comparators, oscillators (which are covered in NEETS, Module 9), filter circuits, and many
other applications. The reason for this widespread use of the operational amplifier is that it is a very
versatile and efficient device. As an integrated circuit (chip) the operational amplifier has become an
inexpensive and readily available "building block" for many devices. In fact, an operational amplifier in
integrated circuit form is no more expensive than a good transistor.
