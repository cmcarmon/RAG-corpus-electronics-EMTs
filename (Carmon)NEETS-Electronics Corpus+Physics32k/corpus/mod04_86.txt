Latex (rubber) tape is a splicing compound. It is used where the original insulation was rubber. The 
tape is applied to the splice with a light tension so that each layer presses tightly against the one beneath 
it. This pressure causes the rubber tape to blend into a solid mass. Upon completion, insulation similar to 
the original is restored.
