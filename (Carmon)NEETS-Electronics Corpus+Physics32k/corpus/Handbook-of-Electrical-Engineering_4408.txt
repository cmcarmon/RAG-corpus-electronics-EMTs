Heat Source. The heat source should provide sufﬁcient energy to soften the glass for pulling the ﬁber without
causing excessive tension and without creating turbulence in the neck-down region. A proper heat source will
yield a ﬁber with uniform diameter and high strength. Oxyhydrogen torches, CO2 lasers, resistance furnaces,
and induction furnaces have been used to draw ﬁbers. An oxyhydrogen torch, although a clean source of heat,
suffers from turbulence due to ﬂame. A CO2 laser is too expensive a heat source to be considered for the large-
scale manufacture of ﬁbers. Graphite resistance furnaces and zirconia induction furnaces are the most widely
used heat sources for ﬁber drawing. In the graphite resistance furnace, a graphite resistive element produces
the required heat. Because graphite reacts with oxygen at high temperatures, an inert environment (e.g., carbon)
is  maintained  inside  the  furnace.  The  zirconia  induction  furnace  does  not  require  inert  environment.  It  is
extremely important that the furnace environment be clean in order to produce high-strength ﬁbers. A zirconia
induction furnace, when properly designed and used, has produced very-high-strength long-length ﬁbers (over
2.0 GPa) in lengths of several kilometers.
