Text
English text is normally represented in ASCII, which uses 8 bits/character. There is considerable redundancy
in  this  representation  (the  entropy  rate  of  English  is  about  1.3  bits/character).  Popular  compression  algo-
rithms  include  variants  of  the  Lempel–Ziv  algorithm,  which  compress  text  ﬁles  by  about  50%  (to  about
4 bits/character).
