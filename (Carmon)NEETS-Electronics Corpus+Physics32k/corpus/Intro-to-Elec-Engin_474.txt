Whereas a continuous change from one value to another is the essential characteristic of an
analog signal and continuous-state (analog) circuits are used to process analog signals, signals
represented by discrete amplitudes at discrete times are handled by discrete-state (digital) circuits.
Analog systems process the information contained in the time function, which deﬁnes the signal,
whereas digital systems, as the name implies, process digits, i.e., pulse trains, in which the
information is carried in the pulse sequence rather than the amplitude–time characterization of the
pulses. Figure 6.0.1 illustrates continuous signals, whereas Figure 6.0.2 depicts discrete signals.
Consider Figure 6.0.1(a) to be a voltage signal (as a function of a continuous-time variable
t) representing a physical quantity, such as the output voltage of a phonograph cartridge. The
discrete signal (which exists only at speciﬁc instances of time) of Figure 6.0.2(a) has the same
amplitude at times t = 0, T1, T2, and T3 as does the continuous signal of Figure 6.0.1(a). Figure
6.0.2(a) represents the sampled-data signal obtained by sampling the continuous signal at periodic
intervals of time. The sequence of pulses in each time interval in Figure 6.0.2(b) is a numeric,
or digital, representation of the corresponding voltage samples shown in Figure 6.0.2(a). Figure
6.0.1(b) may be considered as the signal, called a clock, which sets the timing sequence used in
the generation of the pulses shown in Figure 6.0.2.
