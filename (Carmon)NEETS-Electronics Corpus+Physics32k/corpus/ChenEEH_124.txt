corresponding column and row are not present in the admit-
tance matrix, and there is only one entry in the matrix at
location (j, j). The above is called the circuit stamp for the
element and can be used for all elements that can be written in
admittance form (i.e., the current through the element can be
written in terms of nodal voltages and the element value).
