The time variation of the excitation may be either pulsed or sine wave. The advantage of the pulse is that
response for a wide frequency range can be obtained. But, for accurate results, the frequency-dependent behavior
of biological materials must be included in the calculations. Methods for doing this are well known [Kunz and
Luebbers,  1993;  Taﬂove,  1995]  so  that  transient  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  amplitudes  for  pulse  excitation  can  be
calculated using FDTD [Furse et al., 1994]. When results at a single frequency or at a few speciﬁc frequencies
are desired, then sine wave excitation is preferred. This is especially true if results for the entire body, such as
SAR,  are  needed,  since  storing  the  transient  results  for  the  entire  body  mesh  and  then  applying  fast  Fourier
transformation to calculate the SAR vs. frequency requires extremely large amounts of computer storage.
