For low-frequency applications, PIN diodes and high impedance amplifiers are generally used. For
moderate-frequency applications, PIN diodes and either high impedance amplifiers or transimpedance
amplifiers are used. For high-frequency applications, PINs or APDs are used with transimpedance
amplifiers. As in digital applications, APDs are rarely used in low- or moderate-frequency applications
unless receivers with extremely low sensitivities are required.
