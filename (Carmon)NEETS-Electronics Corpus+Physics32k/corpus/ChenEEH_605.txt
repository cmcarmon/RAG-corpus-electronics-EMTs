The MCT has an uncontrolled on-state performance; hence,
its forward-biased safe operating area (FBSOA) cannot be
deﬁned. The emitter-switched thyristor (EST) has been pro-
posed to achieve control over the thyristor on-state conduc-
tion. The cross-section of an EST is shown in Figure 7.19(B).
The EST has an nþ ﬂoating emitter region in addition to the
basic IGBT structure. When the inversion channel is formed on
application of a gate voltage, device performance is identical to
an IGBT. At higher current levels, hole ﬂow in the p-base
region under the ﬂoating region forward biases the p-nþ junc-
tion, causing latch-up of the vertical thyristor. The thyristor
current ﬂows through the MOS channel before reaching the
emitter terminal. This provides control over the thyristor cur-
rent as resistance of the channel can be varied by changing the
gate voltage. On-state thyristor operation of EST results in a
much higher current density than IGBT. The switching mech-
anism in an EST is identical to an IGBT. Because of a higher
