Chebyshev distance measures distance assuming only the most significant dimension is relevant.
Euclidean distance matrix
Hamming distance identifies the difference bit by bit of two strings
Mahalanobis distance normalizes based on a covariance matrix to make the distance metric scale-invariant.
Manhattan distance measures distance following only axis-aligned directions.
Metric
Minkowski distance is a generalization that unifies Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, and Chebyshev distance.
Pythagorean addition
Haversine distance giving great-circle distances between two points on a sphere from their longitudes and latitudes.
