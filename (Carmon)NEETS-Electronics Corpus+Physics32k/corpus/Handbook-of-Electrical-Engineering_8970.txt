Surface  Acoustic  Wave  (SAW).  This  technology  is
more recent than the others and has not received wide
acceptance as yet. It is based on the transmission through
the glass of SAWs generated by transducers mounted on
the  glass  overlay.  These  waves  are  detected  by  receivers
also mounted on the glass, and the time of arrival of the
waves at the receivers is known because the wave velocity
is known. The placing of a ﬁnger on the glass weakens
the  signal  and  the  location  of  the  ﬁnger  can  be  deter-
mined by the difference in its effect on the SAW.
