However, the picture changes considerably when a long line is used. Since most transmission lines
are electrically long (because of the distance from transmitter to antenna), the properties of such lines
must be considered. Frequently, the voltage necessary to drive a current through a long line is
considerably greater than the amount that can be accounted for by the impedance of the load in series with
the resistance of the line.
