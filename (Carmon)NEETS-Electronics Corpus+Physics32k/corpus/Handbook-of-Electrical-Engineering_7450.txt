The subject of computer-aided design and analysis of communication systems is very much interdisciplinary
in nature. The major disciplines that bear on the subject are communication theory, DSP, numerical analysis,
and  stochastic  process  theory.  The  roles  played  by  these  subjects  is  clear.  The  simulation  user  must  have
knowledge of the behavior of communication theory if the simulation results are to be understood. The analysis
techniques of communication theory allow simulation results to be veriﬁed. Since each subsystem in the overall
communication system is a signal processing operation, the tools of DSP provide the algorithms to realize ﬁlters
and  other  subsystems.  Numerical  analysis  techniques  are  used  extensively  in  the  development  of  signal  pro-
cessing  algorithms.  Since  communication  systems  involve  random  data  signals,  as  well  as  noise  and  other
disturbances, the concepts of stochastic process theory are important in developing models of these quantities
and also for determining performance estimates.
