The various systems and materials used for sealed packaging of
electronic chips certainly are complex. Packaging of MEMS is
usually more difÔ¨Åcult because of their mechanical motions or
other reasons. During the manufacturing of ICs, some testing
can be done at the wafer level as well as after packaging.
