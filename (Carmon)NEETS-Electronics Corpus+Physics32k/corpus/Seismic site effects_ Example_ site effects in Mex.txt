Seismic site effects have been first evidenced during the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. The earthquake epicenter was located along the Pacific Coast (several hundreds kilometers from Mexico-City), the seismic shaking was however extremely strong leading to very large damages.
Figure 2 displays the recordings performed at different distances from the epicenter during the earthquake sequence. The acceleration amplitude measured at different distances changes drastically:
Campos station: this station is located very close to the epicenter and recorded a maximum acceleration of



150

c
m

/


s

2




{\displaystyle 150~cm/s^{2}}
,
Teacalco station: this station is located at more than 200 km from the epicenter and recorded a much lower acceleration (about



18

c
m

/


s

2




{\displaystyle 18~cm/s^{2}}
). This amplitude decay is due to the wave attenuation during the propagation process: geometrical attenuation due to the expansion of the wavefront and material (or instrinsic) attenuation due to the energy dissipation within the medium (e.g. grains friction),
UNAM station: this station is located at more than 300 km from the epicenter and recorded a maximum acceleration of



35

c
m

/


s

2




{\displaystyle 35~cm/s^{2}}
, larger than that recorded at the Teacalco station,
SCT station: this station is located in Mexico City at approximately 400 km from the epicenter and recorded a very strong maximum acceleration (about



170

c

s

{\displaystyle 170~cm/s^{2}}
).
We may notice that the acceleration amplitude strongly decreases first and then increases when the seismic waves reach the alluvial deposit on which Mexico City has been founded.
