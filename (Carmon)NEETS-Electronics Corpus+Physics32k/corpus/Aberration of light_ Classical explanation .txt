In the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components




u

x




{\displaystyle u_{x}}
and




u

y




{\displaystyle u_{y}}
, at an angle



tan
⁡
(
θ
)
=

u

y



/


u

x




{\displaystyle \tan(\theta )=u_{y}/u_{x}}
. If the Earth is moving at velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is




u

x

=

u

x


−
v


{\displaystyle u_{x}'=u_{x}-v}
, and the y velocity is unchanged,




u

y

′

=

u

y




{\displaystyle u_{y}'=u_{y}}
. (Note that you need the velocity of the Sun with respect to the Earth which is the negative of the velocity of the Earth with respect to the Sun. Also note that we are only using vectors here without indication of direction.) Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame is

{\displaystyle \tan(\phi )={\frac {u_{y}'}{u_{x}'}}={\frac {u_{y}}{(u_{x}-v)}}={\frac {\sin(\theta )}{(\cos(\theta )-v/c)}}}

In the case of
