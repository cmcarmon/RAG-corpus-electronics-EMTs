Operational  ampliﬁer  circuits  form  the  heart  of  many  precision  circuits,  e.g.,  regulated  power  supplies,
precision comparators, peak-detection circuits, and waveform generators [Wait et al., 1992]. Another important
area of application is active RC ﬁlters [Huelsman and Allen, 1980]. Microminiature electronic circuits seldom
use inductors. Through the use of op amps, resistors, and capacitors, one can implement precise ﬁlter circuits
(low-pass, high-pass, and bandpass). Figures 27.18 and 27.19 show second-order low-pass and bandpass ﬁlter
circuits that feature relatively low sensitivity of ﬁlter performance to component values. Details are provided
in Wait et al. [1992] and Huelsman and Allen [1980].
