You should note that transmission lines, like all other electronic components, are designed to operate
over a specific range of frequencies. It is not uncommon for a transmission line to operate improperly at
one frequency, yet operate properly over the remainder of its frequency spectrum. You should check
transmission-line losses over their entire frequency range. Insertion loss measurements are normally taken
when a system is first installed or the transmission line is replaced. Periodic measurements should be
performed to enable you to determine if system performance is being degraded by transmission-line
deterioration.
