where GNN is the sum of all conductances connected to node N, GJ K = GKJ is the sum of all
conductances connected between nodes J and K, and IN is the sum of all current sources entering
node N. By solving the equations for the unknown node voltages, other voltages and currents in
the circuit can easily be determined.
