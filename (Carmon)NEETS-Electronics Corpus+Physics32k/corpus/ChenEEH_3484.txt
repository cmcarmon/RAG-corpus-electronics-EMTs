Current instrumentation is analogous to voltage measure-
ment with the replacement of the current transformer for the
potential transformer. Main considerations are appropriate-
ness of the current ratio in the current transformer, isolation
for safety, loading with the proper current transformer burden,
and bandwidth and dynamic range of the current transformer.
Table 10.5 shows some of the basic instruments used in current
instrumentation.
