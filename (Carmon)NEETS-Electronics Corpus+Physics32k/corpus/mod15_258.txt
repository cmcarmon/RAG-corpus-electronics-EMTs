CONTROL SYNCHROS are of three different types: the control transmitter (CX), the control 
transformer (CT), and the control differential transmitter (CDX). The CX and the CDX are identical to the 
TX and the TDX except for higher impedance windings. In theory, the CX and CDX are the same as the 
TX and TDX, respectively.
