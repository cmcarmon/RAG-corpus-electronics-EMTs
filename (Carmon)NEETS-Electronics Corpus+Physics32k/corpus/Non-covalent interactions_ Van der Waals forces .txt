Van der Waals Forces are a subset of electrostatic interactions involving permanent or induced dipoles (or multipoles). These include the following:
permanent dipole-dipole interactions, alternatively called the Keesom force
dipole-induced dipole interactions, or the Debye force
induced dipole-induced dipole interactions, commonly referred to as London dispersion forces
Hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding are typically not classified as Van der Waals forces.
