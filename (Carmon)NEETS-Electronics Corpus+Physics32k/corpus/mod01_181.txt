It has been demonstrated that a charge can be produced by rubbing a rubber rod with fur. Because of
the friction involved, the rod acquires electrons from the fur, making it negative; the fur becomes positive
due to the loss of electrons. These quantities of charge constitute a difference of potential between the rod
and the fur. The electrons which make up this difference of potential are capable of doing work if a
discharge is allowed to occur.
