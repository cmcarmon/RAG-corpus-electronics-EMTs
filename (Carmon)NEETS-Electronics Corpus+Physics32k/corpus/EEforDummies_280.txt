The wiper inside the pot is elec­
trically connected to the center 
terminal and mechanically con­
nected to a shaft, slide, or screw, 
depending on the type of potentiometer. As you move the wiper, the 
 resistance between the center terminal and one end terminal varies from  
0 (zero) up to the maximum value, while the resistance between the center 
terminal and the other end terminal varies from the maximum value down 
to 0 (zero). Not surprisingly, the sum of the two variable resistances always 
equals the fixed maximum resistance (that is, the resistance between the 
two end terminals).
