The parity bit (also called a check bit, the C position in a code) provides an internal means for 
checking the validity, the correctness, of code construction. That is, the total number of bits in a character, 
including the parity bit, must always be odd or always be even, depending upon whether the particular 
computer system or device you are using is odd or even parity. Therefore, the coding is said to be in either 
odd or even parity code, and the test for bit count is called a parity check.
