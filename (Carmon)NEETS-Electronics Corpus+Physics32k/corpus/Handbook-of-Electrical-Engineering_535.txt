A single-phase full-wave rectiÔ¨Åer circuit with the accompanying input and output voltage waveforms is shown
in Fig. 5.4. This topology makes use of a center-tapped transformer with each diode conducting on opposite
half-cycles of the input voltage. The forward drop across the diodes is ignored on the output graph, which is
a valid approximation if the peak voltages of the input and output are large compared to 1 V. The circuit changes
p .
a sinusoidal waveform with no dc component (zero average value) to one with a dc component of  2 V peak /
The rms value of the output is 0.707 V peak .
