Treated byproduct will be placed mixed waste cell for a permanent disposition. The mixed waste cell is engineered with a triple high-density polyethylene (HDPE) liner system. Collected layers between each line provide leak liquid management and leakage detection for the cell, while a foundation of engineered clay stabilizes the liner system. The waste is buried in a 7 ft clay radon barrier, a rock filter zone, and a coarse rock erosion barrier.
