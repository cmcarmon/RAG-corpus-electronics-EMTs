microprocessor.  In  a  simple  microprocessor,  the 
address  buffer  is  unidirectional  with  addresses 
placed  on  the  address  bus  during  both  read  and 
write operations. The address bus lines are labelled 
A0  to  A15,  where  A0  is  the  least-significant 
address  bus  line  and  A16  is  the  most  significant 
address bus line. Note that a 16-bit address bus can 
be  used  to  communicate  with  65,536  individual 
memory locations. At each location a single byte of 
data is stored. 
 
Control bus 
 
The control bus is a collection of signal lines that 
are both used to control the transfer of data around 
the  system  and  also  to  interact  with  external 
devices. 
by 
microprocessors tend to differ with different types, 
however the following are commonly found: 
 
READ 
 
 
WRITE  an output signal from the microprocessor 
that indicates that the  current operation 
 
is a write operation 
 
a  signal  that  resets  the  internal  registers 
RESET 
 
and  initializes  the  program  counter  so 
that  the  program  can  be  re-started  from 
 
the beginning 
 
interrupt request from an external device 
IRQ  
 
attempting  to  gain  the  attention  of  the 
microprocessor  (the  request  may  be 
 
obeyed  or  ignored  according  to  the 
 
state  of  the  microprocessor  at  the  time 
 
 
that the interrupt request is received).
