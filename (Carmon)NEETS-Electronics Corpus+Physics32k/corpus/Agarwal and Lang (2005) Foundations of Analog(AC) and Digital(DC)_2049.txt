e x a m p l e 14.5 a n o t h e r r l c c i r c u i t e x a m p l e The input
vz in the second-order circuit in Figure 14.25 is a sinusoid. Determine the impedance
Z. Determine also ωo, α, ωd, and Q for the circuit. Show that the circuit is resonant
for the element values indicated in Figure 14.25. Plot the magnitude and phase of the
system function Iz/Vz as a function of frequency, and sketch the low- and high-frequency
asymptotes.
