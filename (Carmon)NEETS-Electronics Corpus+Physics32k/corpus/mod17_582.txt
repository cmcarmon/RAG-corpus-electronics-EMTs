A typical microwave transmitter includes an exciter group, a modulator group, a power amplifier, 
and power supplies. The transmitter usually has a power output of about 1 watt. When a higher output is 
required (about 5 watts), a traveling-wave tube (twt) is used as the amplifier. (A twt is a high-gain, low-
noise, wide-bandwidth microwave amplifier. It is capable of gains of 40 decibels or more, with 
bandwidths of over an octave. The twt was discussed in chapter 2 of NEETS, Module 11, Microwave 
Principles.) A typical microwave receiver contains an rf-IF group, local oscillator, demodulator, and 
amplifier. Both transmitters and receivers contain special circuits because of the high operating 
frequencies and critical frequency stability requirements.
