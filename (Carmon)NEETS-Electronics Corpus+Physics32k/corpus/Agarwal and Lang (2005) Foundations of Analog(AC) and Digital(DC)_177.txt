Familiar primary sources of energy in our daily lives are sunlight, oil, and coal.
Secondary sources would be power plants, gasoline engines, home-heating
furnaces, or flashlight batteries. In heating systems, energy flows through air
ducts or heating pipes; in electrical systems the flow is through copper wires.15
Similarly, information sources include speech, books, compact discs, videos,
and the web (some of it, anyway!). Information flow in speech systems is
through media such as air and water; in electronic systems, such as computers
or phones, the flow relies on conducting wires. Sensors such as microphones,
magnetic tape heads, and optical scanners convert information from various
forms into an electrical representation. None of these elements is ideal, so our
first task is to invent ideal energy or information sources and ideal conductors
for energy or information flow.
