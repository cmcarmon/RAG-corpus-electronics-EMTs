By its very nature, the physical modeling error requires some kind of measurement for its determination,
except  for  those  few  problems  whose  analytical  solution  in  principle  involves  no  physical  idealization  or
subsequent numerical approximation. One example of such problems is that of determining the scattering or
radiating properties of the perfectly conducting or dielectric sphere.
