in which operators Tk = [I + lk(Pk –  I)] are employed. They proved that the sequence so generated converges
weakly to a point of C for any choice of the relaxation constants lk in the open interval 0 < lk < 2. Moreover,
if at least one of the closed convex sets Ck is contained in a ﬁnite-dimensional subspace, then the convergence
is strong.
