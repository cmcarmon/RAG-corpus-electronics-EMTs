Adjustment of the brake is done through the adjuster (6) which basically is a screw that can be accessed when the brake is assembled. The adjustment is necessary to make sure that the brake is working as expected and not applying brake force when not expected by having too tight margins while still retaining a good responsiveness from the brake.
