Implementation of FIR Filters Using the Discrete Fourier Transform
A method for implementing FIR ﬁlters that can have computational advantages over direct-form convolution
involves processing the input data in blocks using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) via the overlap-save
method. The computational advantage arises primarily from use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm
(discussed in Section 14.2) to compute the DFTs of the individual data blocks. In this method, the input data
sequence {x(n); – ¥ < n < ¥} is divided into  L-point blocks
