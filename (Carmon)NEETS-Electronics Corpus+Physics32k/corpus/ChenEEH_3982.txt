Partitioning the same DG to several blocks is considered a
special case of multistage systolic mapping MSSM (Hwang and
Hu, 1992), where each stage is characterized by a different DG of
a different nested Do-loop algorithm. It can be viewed as an
locally parallel globally parallel (LPGP). Scheduling problem for
parallel processing of a complex operation chain. After mapping
consecutive stages, it may result in mismatched I/O operations.
