PIN Photodiodes. The carriers which are generated in the junction region experience the highest ﬁeld and
so, being separated rapidly, give the fastest time response. The PIN diode has an extra intrinsic high ﬁeld layer
between the p and n regions, designed to absorb the light. This minimizes the generation of slow carriers and
results in a fast response detector.
