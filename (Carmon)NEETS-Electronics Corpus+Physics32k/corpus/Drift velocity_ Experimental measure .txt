The formula for evaluating the drift velocity of charge carriers in a material of constant cross-sectional area is given by:




u
=


j

n
q



,


{\displaystyle u={j \over nq},}

where u is the drift velocity of electrons, j is the current density flowing through the material, n is the charge-carrier number density, and q is the charge on the charge-carrier.
In terms of the basic properties of the right-cylindrical current-carrying metallic ohmic conductor, where the charge-carriers are electrons, this expression can be rewritten as:




u
=



m

σ
Δ
V


ρ
e
f
ℓ



,


{\displaystyle u={m\;\sigma \Delta V \over \rho ef\ell },}

where
u is again the drift velocity of the electrons, in m⋅s−1
m is the molecular mass of the metal, in kg
σ is the electric conductivity of the medium at the temperature considered, in S/m.
ΔV is the voltage applied across the conductor, in V
ρ is the density (mass per unit volume) of the conductor, in kg⋅m−3
e is the elementary charge, in C
f is the number of free electrons per atom
ℓ is the length of the conductor, in m
