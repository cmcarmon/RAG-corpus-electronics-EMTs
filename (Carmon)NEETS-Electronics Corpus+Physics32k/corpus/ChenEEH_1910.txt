In TMR (Johnson, 1989), the classic hardware redundant
technique for error correction, three copies of a module per-
form the same computation simultaneously. A majority voter
selects the result upon which at least two of the modules have
agreed. Time overhead is very small, but hardware overhead is
greater than 200%. A related technique, PTMR, has been
developed by three independent groups (Arian and Gumusel,
1992; Chen et al., 1992; Hsu and Swartzlander, 1992), and is
also known as hardware partition in time redundancy (HPTR)
(Arian and Gumusel, 1992) and recomputing with triplication
with voting (RETWV) (Hsu and Swartzlander, 1992). In this
technique, three copies of a single partition of the circuit
simultaneously process a portion of the operands, and the
results are voted on, as in TMR. The remaining portions of
the operands are processed similarly by the same triplicated
partition. When there are three independent partitions, the
time overhead is 200%. For linearly dependent partitions in
adders and multipliers, time overhead can be lower, and area
overheads range from under 100% to about 150%.
