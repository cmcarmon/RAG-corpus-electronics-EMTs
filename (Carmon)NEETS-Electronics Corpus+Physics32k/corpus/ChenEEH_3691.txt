Autocorrelation Method and Lattice Structures
In either the autocorrelation or covariance solution, obtaining
the ﬁnal LP parameter estimate, ^aa, ultimately requires the
solution of a matrix–vector equation of the form Ax ¼ b, in
which A is a square matrix that is reasonably assumed to be of
full rank, M. This is a widely studied problem for which
numerous methods exist (Golub and van Loan, 1989). Solu-
tions to general problems of this form tend to be of O(M 3)
computational complexity.
