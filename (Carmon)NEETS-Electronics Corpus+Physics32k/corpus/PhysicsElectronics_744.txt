Normally signals ﬂip from one logic state to another. The time it takes the signal to move
between states is the transition time tt, where the time is measured between 10% and 90%
of the signal levels. Delays within the logic elements result in a propagation (pulse) delay
tpd, where the time is measured between 50% of the input signal and 50% of the output
response. Deﬁnitions of the transition time and propagation delay are shown in ﬁgure 7.5.
