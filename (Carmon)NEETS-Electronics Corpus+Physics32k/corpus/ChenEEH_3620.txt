In this case, ei(n) represents a zero mean white noise process.
We can consider that in practice, ei(n) and ek(n þ l) are statis-
tically independent for any value of n or l (for i 6¼ k). As a
result, the contributions of different noise sources can be taken
into consideration separately by using the principle of super-
position.
