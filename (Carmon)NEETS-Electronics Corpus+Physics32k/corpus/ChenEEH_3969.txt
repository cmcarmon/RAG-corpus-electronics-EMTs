The regular structure of nested Do-loop algorithms has been
explored extensively for a compiler of general-purpose parallel
computing (Banerjee, 1993; Wolfe, 1996). With the help of the
compiler, the algorithms can be executed according to particu-
lar scheduling and assignment to match the underlying archi-
tecture such as SIMD, MIMD, and many others. In general,
without the regular structure of loop indices, such scheduling
and assignment are NP-hard.
