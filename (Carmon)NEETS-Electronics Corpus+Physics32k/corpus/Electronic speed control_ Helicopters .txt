ESCs designed for radio-control helicopters do not require a braking feature (since the one way bearing would render it useless anyhow) nor do they require reverse direction (although it can be helpful since the motor wires can often be difficult to access and change once installed).

Many high-end  helicopter ESCs provide a "Governor mode" which fixes the motor RPM to a set speed, greatly aiding CCPM-based flight. It is also used in quadcopters.
