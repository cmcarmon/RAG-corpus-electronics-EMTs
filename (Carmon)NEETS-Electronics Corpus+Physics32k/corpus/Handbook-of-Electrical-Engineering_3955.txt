FIGURE 39.4 Discontinuities. Waveguide discontinuities: (a) capacitive E-plane discontinuity, (b) inductive H-plane dis-
continuity, (c) symmetrical inductive H-plane discontinuity, (d) inductive post discontinuity, (e) resonant window discon-
tinuity,  (f) capacitive  post  discontinuity,  (g) diode  post  mount,  and  (h) quarter-wave  impedance  transformer.  Microstrip
discontinuities: (i) quarter-wave impedance transformer, (j) open microstrip stub, (k) step, (l) notch, (m) gap, (n) crossover,
and (o) bend.
