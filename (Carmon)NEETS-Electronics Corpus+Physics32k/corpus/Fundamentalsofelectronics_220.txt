The circuit’s output to a sinusoidal input is also a sinusoid, having a gain equal to the magnitude
of the circuit’s transfer function evaluated at the source frequency and a phase equal to the
phase of the transfer function at the source frequency. It will turn out that this input-output relation
description applies to any linear circuit having a sinusoidal source.
