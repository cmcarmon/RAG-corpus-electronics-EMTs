Aberration Monitoring
The aberration monitor takes the environmental pressure data
and the depth output of the digital block to calculate an
absolute error and an analog value corresponding to the digital
depth information. The results of the monitoring are depicted
in the third trace as part of the overall simulation results
shown in Figure 3.14.
