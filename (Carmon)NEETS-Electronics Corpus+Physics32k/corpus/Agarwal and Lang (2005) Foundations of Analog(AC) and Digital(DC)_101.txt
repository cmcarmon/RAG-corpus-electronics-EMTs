Thus far, our discussion focused on the constraints that allowed us to treat
individual elements as being lumped. We can now turn our attention to circuits.
As defined earlier, circuits are sets of lumped elements connected by ideal wires.
Currents outside the lumped elements are confined to the wires. An ideal wire
does not develop a voltage across its terminals, irrespective of the amount of
current it carries. Furthermore, we choose the wires such that they obey the
lumped matter discipline, so the wires themselves are also lumped elements.
