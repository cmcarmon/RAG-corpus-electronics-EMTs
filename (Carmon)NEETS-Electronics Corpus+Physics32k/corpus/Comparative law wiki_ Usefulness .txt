Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing comparative legal analysis. Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place. Crowdsourcing permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.
Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.
