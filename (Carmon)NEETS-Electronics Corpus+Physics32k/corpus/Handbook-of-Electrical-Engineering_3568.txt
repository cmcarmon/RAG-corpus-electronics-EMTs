The combinational digital design is defective because a
manufacturing  defect  has  caused  the  output  of  the  top
and gate to be permanently tied to ground, i.e., stuck-at-
0, using a positive logic convention. To sensitize the fault,
the inputs A and B should both be set to 1, which should
force the top and gate output to a 1 for a good circuit. To
propagate  the  fault,  the  inputs  C  and  D  should  both  be
set to 0, which should force the xor gate output to 1, again
for a good circuit. Thus, if A = 1, B = 1, C = 0, and D = 0
in Fig. 34.18, then a good circuit would yield a 1, but the
defective  circuit  yields  a  0,  which  detects  the  stuck-at-0
fault at the top and gate output.
