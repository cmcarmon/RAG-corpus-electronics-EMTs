The speed and power of the digital computer (in predicting the response to a wide range of
changes that affect the system) are the main reasons for the use of adaptive systems in industrial
control. Large-scale systems may have multiple inputs applied simultaneously, and control is
successfully achieved because the process of predicting the desired response, and comparing
with the actual response, can be accomplished in a relatively short time compared to the response
time of the system to be controlled.
