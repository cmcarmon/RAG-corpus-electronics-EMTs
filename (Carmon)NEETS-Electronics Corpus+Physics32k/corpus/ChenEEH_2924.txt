ISAR Imaging of Rotating Objects
The procedure of ISAR imaging of rotating objects is as
follows: The object to be imaged is mounted on a rotation
pedestal. At each aspect, wideband complex frequency re-
sponses (amplitude and phase) or high-resolution range pro-
ﬁles of the backscattered ﬁelds are measured and recorded.
The object is then rotated by a small angle, and another set
of frequency responses or range proﬁles are taken. This process
is repeated until data are gathered for a speciﬁed total rotation
angle. If the measured quantities are the frequency responses,
the data collected are arranged in a polar format as shown in
Figure 10.8(A), where the radial line represents the frequency
and where the azimuth represents the rotation angle. The point
(fi, fm, ) represents the data measured at frequency fi and
