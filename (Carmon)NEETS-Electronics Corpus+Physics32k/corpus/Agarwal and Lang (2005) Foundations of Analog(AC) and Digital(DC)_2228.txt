Find the transfer function V4/V1. (You may assume that the Op Amp is ideal, that
is V
Sketch the magnitude of the transfer function |V4/V1| versus frequency. Indicate
the frequency at which the peak occurs, the magnitude of the transfer function at
the peak, and the Q of the resonance. Use the following numerical values:
C1 = C2 = 0.01 ÂµF R1 = 10  R2 = 1 k
