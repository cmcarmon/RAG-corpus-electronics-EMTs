The electron beam is developed, focused, and accelerated by the electron gun. The beam appears on
the screen of the CRT as a small, bright dot. If the beam is left in one position, the electrons will soon
burn away the illuminating coating in that one area. To be of any use, the beam must be able to move. As
you have studied, an electrostatic field can bend the path of a moving electron.
