(16.2.13)
where cf(t) denotes response with feedback. The system is now clearly stable with aK > τ . Thus,
the insertion of feedback causes the unstable direct transmission system of Figure 16.2.4(a) to
become stable. Such a technique is often used to stabilize space rockets and vehicles, which are
inherently unstable because of their large length-to-diameter ratios.
Note that the direct transfer function of Equation (16.2.8) has a pole located in the right half
p-plane at p = 1/τ , whereas the pole of the closed-loop transfer function of Equation (16.2.12)
with aK > τ is located in the left half p-plane.
