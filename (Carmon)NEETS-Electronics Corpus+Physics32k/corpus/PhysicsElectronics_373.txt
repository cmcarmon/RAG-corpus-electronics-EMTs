a particular diode. However, for a real diode, other factors are also important: in particular,
edge eﬀects around the border of the junction cause the actual reverse current to increase
slightly with reverse voltage, and the ﬁnite conductivity of the doped semi-conductor ulti-
mately restricts the forward current to a linear increase with increasing applied voltage. A
better current-voltage curve for the real diode is shown in the ﬁgure 4.3b.
