12.2.1 An elementary two-pole, single-phase, synchro-
nous machine, as illustrated in Figure P12.2.1,
has a ﬁeld winding on its rotor and an armature
winding on its stator, with Nf = 400 turns and
Na = 50 turns, respectively. The uniform air gap
is of length 1 mm, while the armature diameter is
0.5 m, and the axial length of the machine is 1.5
m. The ﬁeld winding carries a current of 1 A (dc)
and the rotor is driven at 3600 r/min. Determine:
(a) The frequency of the stator-induced voltage.
(b) The rms-induced voltage in the stator wind-
