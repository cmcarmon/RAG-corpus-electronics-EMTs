The direction of current through each resistor is determined by the polarity across each
resistor, not by the polarity across each battery, as current can be forced backwards through a
battery, as is the case with B3 in the example circuit. This is important to keep in mind, since
Millman’s Theorem doesn’t provide as direct an indication of “wrong” current direction as does
