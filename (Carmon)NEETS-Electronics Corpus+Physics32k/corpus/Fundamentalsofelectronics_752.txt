The complex exponential portion has the form of a propagating wave. If we could take a snapshot of the
voltage (take its picture at t = t1), we would see a sinusoidally varying waveform along the transmission
line. One period of this variation, known as the wavelength, equals λ = 2π/b. If we were to take a second
picture at some later time t = t2, we would also see a sinusoidal voltage. Because
