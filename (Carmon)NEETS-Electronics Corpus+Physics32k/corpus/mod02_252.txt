This might be a good place to recall what you learned about phase in chapter 1. When two things are 
in step, going through a cycle together, falling together and rising together, they are in phase. When they 
are out of phase, the angle of lead or lag-the number of electrical degrees by which one of the values leads 
or lags the other-is a measure of the amount they are out of step. The time it takes the current in an 
inductor to build up to maximum and to fall to zero is important for another reason. It helps illustrate a 
very useful characteristic of inductive circuits-the current through the inductor always lags the voltage 
across the inductor.
