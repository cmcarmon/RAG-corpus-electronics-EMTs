A prominent example of the classical three-body problem is the movement of a planet with a satellite around a star. The general case of the three body problem does not have a known solution, and is addressed by numerical analysis approximations.
In most cases such a system can be factorized, considering the movement of the complex system (planet and satellite) around a star as a single particle; then, considering the movement of the satellite around the planet, neglecting the movement around the star. In this case, the problem is simplified to two instances of the two-body problem. The effect of the star on the movement of the satellite around the planet can then be considered as a perturbation.
A three-body problem also arises from the situation of a spacecraft and two relevant celestial bodies, e.g. the Earth and the Moon, such as when considering a free return trajectory around the Moon, or other trans-lunar injection. While a spaceflight involving a gravity assist tends to be at least a four-body problem (spacecraft, Earth, Sun, Moon), once far away from the Earth when Earth's gravity becomes negligible, it is approximately a three-body problem.
The general statement for the three body problem is as follows. At an instant in time, for vector positions xi and masses mi, three coupled second-order differential equations exist:

A complete solution for a particular three-body problem would provide the positions for all three particles for all time given three initial positions and initial velocities. In general, no closed-form solution for such a problem exists, and the time evolution of the system is believed to be chaotic. The use of computers, however, makes solutions of arbitrarily high accuracy over a finite time span possible using Numerical methods for integration of the trajectories.
