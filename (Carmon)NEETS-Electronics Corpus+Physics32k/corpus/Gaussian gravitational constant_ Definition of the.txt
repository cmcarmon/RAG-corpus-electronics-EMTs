Gauss intended his constant to be defined using a mean distance of Earth from the Sun of 1 astronomical unit precisely. With the acceptance of the 1964 resolutions, the IAU, in effect, did the opposite: defined the constant as fundamental, and the astronomical unit as derived, the other variables in the definition being already fixed: mass (of the Sun), and time (the day of 86400 seconds). This transferred the uncertainty from the gravitational constant to an uncertainty in the mean distance of Earth from the Sun, which was no longer exactly one a.u. The Earth's mean distance became an observed quantity rather than a defined, fixed one.
In 1976, the IAU reconfirmed the Gaussian constant's status at the XVIth General Assembly in Grenoble, declaring it to be a defining constant, and that

The astronomical unit of length is that length (A) for which the Gaussian gravitational constant (k) takes the value 0.01720209895 when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time. The dimensions of k2 are those of the constant of gravitation (G), i.e., L3M−1T−2. The term "unit distance" is also used for the length (A).

From this definition, the mean distance of Earth from the Sun works out to 1.00000003 a.u., but with perturbations by the other planets, which do not average to zero over time, the average distance is 1.0000002 a.u.
