Large-Signal Transient Operation
During (fast) switching, the base resistance can change signiÔ¨Å-
cantly over time. At the beginning of a switching process, only
the portion at the emitter edge is charged or discharged,
leading initially to a small value of the effective internal base
resistance zBi(t). With a continuing turn-on process, the region
toward the center starts to get charged, too, and zBi increases
with time, until it approaches the dc value at the end of the
turn-on process. For the turn-off process, the discharge of
the emitter edge region continues, thus making this region
high-ohmic compared to the center region that acts as a
conducting transistor. Therefore, zBi not only starts to become
larger than rBi but also keeps increasing during the remainder
of the turn-off process. Overall, for switching:
