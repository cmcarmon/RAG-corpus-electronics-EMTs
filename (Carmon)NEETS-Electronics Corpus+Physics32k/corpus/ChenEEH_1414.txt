The run-time reconﬁgurable artiﬁcial neural network de-
veloped by Eldridge and Hutchings (1994) uses dynamic re-
conﬁguration to implement three stages of a neural network
back-propagation algorithm. Each stage of the algorithm is
represented by a circuit module that is swapped in and out
of the FPGA hardware as demanded by the application. Only
one circuit module is resident on the FPGA at a given time.
