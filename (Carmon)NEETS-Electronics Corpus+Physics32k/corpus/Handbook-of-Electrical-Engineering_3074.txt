While  several  passive  realizations  of  ﬁrst-order  ﬁlters  are  possible  (low-pass,  high-pass,  and  lead-lag),  the
active circuits shown here are inexpensive and avoid any loading of the other ﬁlter sections when the individual
circuits are cascaded. Consequently, these circuits are preferred unless there is some reason to avoid the use of
the  additional  operational  ampliﬁer.  Note  that  a  second-order  ﬁlter  can  be  realized  using  one  operational
amplifer as shown in the following paragraphs, so it is common practice to choose even-order transfer functions,
thus avoiding the use of any ﬁrst-order ﬁlters.
