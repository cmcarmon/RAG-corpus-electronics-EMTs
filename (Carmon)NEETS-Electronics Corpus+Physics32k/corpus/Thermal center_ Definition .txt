The thermal center is defined under the following hypothesis:
A solid body with homogeneous and isotropic thermal properties;
Isostatically constrained;
A thermal variation ΔT is applied to the entire body.
The thermal variation will produce an expansion of the body: this means that for each couple of points P and Q the distance will become:

is the coefficient of thermal expansion. Analyzing this phenomenon in an absolute coordinate system, the transformation of the solid body is a geometrical similarity. It is possible that, choosing the constrains conveniently, one point belonging to the space associated to the body will not move during the thermal variation: this point is called thermal center. In this case, the geometrical similarity becomes an homothety and the thermal center is the center of the homothety itself.
The thermal center does not always exist. The TC is a function of the constraints. Picture B shows an example where the geometry of the constraints doesn't come to a unique point.
The TC may exist even if the body has non-homogeneous isotropic thermal properties, but when this condition is not verified, it's not possible to determine its position by using the simple geometric method shown above, and the transformation will not be a homothety.
