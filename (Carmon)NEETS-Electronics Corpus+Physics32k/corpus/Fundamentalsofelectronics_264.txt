The large gain catches the eye; it suggests that an op-amp could turn a 1 mV input signal into a 100 V one.
If you were to build such a circuit—attaching a voltage source to node a, attaching node b to the reference,
and looking at the output—you would be disappointed. In dealing with electronic components, you cannot
forget the unrepresented but needed power supply.
