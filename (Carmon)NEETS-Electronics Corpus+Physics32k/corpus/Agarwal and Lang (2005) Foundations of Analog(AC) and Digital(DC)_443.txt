The first two steps in its node analysis, namely the selection of a ground
node and the labeling of its node voltages, are already complete. As shown in
Figure 3.12, Node 4 is selected as the ground node, Node 3 is labeled with the
known voltage V of the independent source, and Nodes 1 and 2 are labeled
with the unknown node voltages e1 and e2, respectively. Node 4 is a good
choice for the ground node because it joins the largest number of branches and
connects directly to the voltage source.
