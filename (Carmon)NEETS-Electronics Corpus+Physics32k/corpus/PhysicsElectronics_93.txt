Since Ohm’s law and Kirchoﬀ’s equations are linear, we can replace any DC circuit by a
simpliﬁed circuit. Just like a combination of resistors and Ohm’s law could give an equivalent
resistor, a combination of circuit elements and Kirchoﬀ’s laws can give an equivalent circuit.
Two possibilities are shown in ﬁgure 1.8.
