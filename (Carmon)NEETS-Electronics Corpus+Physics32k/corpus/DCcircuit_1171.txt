Primarily for reasons of safety, certain standards for electrical wiring have been established
within the United States, and are speciÔ¨Åed in the National Electrical Code (NEC). Typical
NEC wire ampacity tables will show allowable maximum currents for different sizes and ap-
plications of wire. Though the melting point of copper theoretically imposes a limit on wire
ampacity, the materials commonly employed for insulating conductors melt at temperatures
far below the melting point of copper, and so practical ampacity ratings are based on the ther-
mal limits of the insulation. Voltage dropped as a result of excessive wire resistance is also
a factor in sizing conductors for their use in circuits, but this consideration is better assessed
through more complex means (which we will cover in this chapter). A table derived from an
NEC listing is shown for example:
