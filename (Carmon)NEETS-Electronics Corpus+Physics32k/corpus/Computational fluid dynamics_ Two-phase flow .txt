The modeling of two-phase flow is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the Volume of fluid method, the Level set method and front tracking. These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass . This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface. Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase.
