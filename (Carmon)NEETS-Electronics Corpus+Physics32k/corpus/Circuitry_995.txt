Each  logic  gate  shown  in  Fig.  A8.31  is  a  two 
input NAND gate. We can construct the truth table 
for  the  control  circuit  (see  Fig.  A8.32)  by  placing 
all four possible combinations of 0 and 1 on the S1 
and  S2  inputs  and  tracing  the  logic  states  through 
the  circuit.  We  have  shown  the  first  stage  of  this 
process (the logic conditions that produce the first 
line of the truth table) in Fig. A8.32.
