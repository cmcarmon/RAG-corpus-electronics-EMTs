Various combinations of electronic equipment are interconnected to form a system capable of
performing specific functions. You must be able to apply general test methods and practices to
installation, tuning, maintenance, and repair of the system. This requires you to have a thorough
knowledge of many types of electronic equipment. When radar, communication, and digital computers
are interconnected, they require different maintenance procedures than when they are operated separately.
Revised test procedures may be necessary. Detrimental interactions between equipment or facilities must
be corrected and effective preventive maintenance procedures must be planned for all equipment within
the system. System quality figures, such as sensitivity and coverage, must be determined and measured
during equipment preventive maintenance checks to assure efficient operation. System monitoring at
specific test points is often used to help localize a problem.
