Electrical  engineers  who  specialize  in  computer  engineering  ﬁnd
jobs  in  computer  industries  and  in  numerous  ﬁelds  where  computers
are being used. Companies that produce software are growing rapidly
in number and size and providing employment for those who are skilled
in  programming.  An  excellent  way  to  advance  one’s  knowledge  of
computers  is  to  join  the  IEEE  Computer  Society,  which  sponsors
diverse magazines, journals, and conferences.
