Physical capacitors are often made of tightly rolled sheets of metal ﬁlm, with a dielectric
(paper or nylon) sandwiched in between, in order to increase their capacitance values (or ability
to store energy) for a given size. Table 1.2.4 lists the range of general-purpose capacitances together
with the maximum voltages and frequencies for different types of dielectric materials. Practical
capacitors come in a wide range of values, shapes, sizes, voltage ratings, and constructions. Both
ﬁxed and adjustable devices are available. Larger capacitors are of the electrolytic type, using
aluminum oxide as the dielectric.
