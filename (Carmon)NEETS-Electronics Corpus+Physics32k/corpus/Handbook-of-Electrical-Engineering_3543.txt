initial values are assigned to all signals. Initial values include starting values and pending values that constitute
future  events.  Simulation  time  is  advanced  to  the  next  pending  event(s),  signals  are  updated,  and  sensitized
models  are  evaluated  [Pooch,  1993].  The  process  of  evaluating  the  sensitized  models  yields  new,  potentially
different, values for signals, i.e., a new set of pending events. These new events are added to the list of pending
events, time is advanced to the next pending event(s), and the simulation algorithm repeats. Each pass through
simulation  cycle
.
the  loop  in  Fig. 34.13  of  evaluating  sensitized  models  at  a  particular  time  step  is  called  a 
Simulation  ends  when  the  design  yields  no  further  activity,  i.e.,  when  there  are  no  more  pending  events  to
process.
