In nuclear physics, coupled cluster saw significantly less use than in quantum chemistry during the 1980s and 1990s. More powerful computers as well as advances in theory (such as the inclusion of three-nucleon interactions) have spawned renewed interest in the method since then, and it has been successfully applied to neutron-rich and medium mass nuclei. Coupled cluster is one of several ab initio methods in nuclear physics, and is specifically suitable for nuclei having closed or nearly closed shells.
