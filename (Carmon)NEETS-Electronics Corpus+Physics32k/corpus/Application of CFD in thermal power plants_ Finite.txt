Finite difference method describes the unknowns of the flow problem by means of point samples at the node points of a grid co-ordinate lines. Taylor series expansions are used to generate finite difference approximations of derivatives in terms of point samples at each grid point and its immediate neighbours. Those derivatives appearing in the governing equations are replaced by finite differences yielding an algebraic equation.
