5.4.8 An inverting ampliﬁer is designed with three in-
puts, v1, v2, and v3, as shown in Figure P5.4.8. De-
termine the output voltage. Then indicate how the
circuit may be modiﬁed to perform as a summer.
5.4.9 A negative impedance converter is used, as shown
in Figure P5.4.9. Show that the load current iL
is given by vin/R, which is independent of ZL.
Note that since the load sees a current source, the
network is a voltage-to-current converter.
