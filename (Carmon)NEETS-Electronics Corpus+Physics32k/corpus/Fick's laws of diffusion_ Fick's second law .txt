Fick's second law predicts how diffusion causes the concentration to change with time. It is a partial differential equation which in one dimension reads:







∂

∂
t



=
D





∂

φ


∂

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial t}}=D\,{\frac {\partial ^{2}\varphi }{\partial x^{2}}}\,\!}

where
φ is the concentration in dimensions of [(amount of substance) length−3], example mol/m3; φ = φ(x,t) is a function that depends on location x and time t
t is time [s]
D is the diffusion coefficient in dimensions of [length2 time−1], example m2/s
x is the position [length], example m
In two or more dimensions we must use the Laplacian Δ = ∇2, which generalises the second derivative, obtaining the equation
