In physics, the angular velocity of a particle is the time rate of change of its angular displacement relative to the origin. The SI unit of angular velocity is radians per second. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (ω, sometimes Ω).
In three dimensions, the angular velocity of a particle can be represented as a vector, with its direction pointing perpendicular to both the position and velocity vectors, in a fashion specified (conventionally) by the right-hand rule.
