Due to mobility of each automaton the MCA method allows to take into account directly such actions as:
mass mixing
penetration effects
chemical reactions
intensive deformation
phase transformations
accumulation of damages
fragmentation and fracture
cracks generation and development
Using boundary conditions of different types (fixed, elastic, viscous-elastic, etc.) it is possible to imitate different properties of surrounding medium, containing the simulated system. It is possible to model different modes of mechanical loading (tension, compression, shear strain, etc.) by setting up additional conditions at the boundaries.
