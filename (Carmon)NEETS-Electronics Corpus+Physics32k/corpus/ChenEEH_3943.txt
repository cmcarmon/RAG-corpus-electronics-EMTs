The Neyman-Pearson Lemma showed that if one desires to
increase the power of an LRT, one must also accept the conse-
quence of an increased false-alarm rate. As such, the Neyman-
Pearson detection criterion is aimed to maximize the power
under the constraint
the false-alarm rate be upper
bounded by, say, a0. The Neyman-Pearson detector can be
derived by ﬁrst deﬁning a cost function:
