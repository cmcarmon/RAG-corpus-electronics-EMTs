s e g m e n t s Although the previous examples illustrated the piecewise linear analy-
sis method, they did not do full justice to the power of the technique, since the equivalent
circuits within each of the linear segments were very simple (for example, the circuits in
Figures 4.24b and 4.24c, or the circuits in Figures 4.25c and 4.25d, and did not require
any of our powerful analysis techniques such as superposition that rely on linearity. We
will now work a slightly more complicated example to illustrate the full power of the
piecewise linear analysis method.
