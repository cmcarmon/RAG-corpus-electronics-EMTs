“Superlubricity is a frictionless tribological state sometimes occurring in nanoscale material junctions”.
At the nanoscale, friction tends to be non isotropic: if two surfaces sliding against each other have incommensurate surface lattice structures, each atom is subject to different amount of force from different directions . Forces, in this situation, can offset each other, resulting in almost zero friction.
The very first proof of this was obtained using a UHV-STM to measure. If lattices are incommensurable, friction was not observed, however, if the surfaces are commensurable, friction force is present. At the atomic level, these tribological properties are directly connected with superlubricity.
An example of this is given by solid lubricants, such as graphite, MoS2 and Ti3SiC2: this can be explained with the low resistance to shear between layers due to the stratified structure of these solids.
Even if at the macroscopic scale friction involves multiple microcontacts with different size and orientation, basing on these experiments one can speculate that a large fraction of contacts will be in superlubric regime. This leads to a great reduction in average friction force, explaining why such solids have a lubricant effect.
Other experiments carried out with the LFM shows that the stick-slip regime is not visible if the applied normal load is negative: the sliding of the tip is smooth and the average friction force seems to be zero
