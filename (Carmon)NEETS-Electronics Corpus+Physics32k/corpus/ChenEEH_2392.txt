corresponds to the thumb of the right hand as the wave
polarization vector spins around in the directions of the ﬁngers
of the right hand (with ﬁngers curved in a rotational orienta-
tion). Alternately, the wave is called an LHP wave when the left
hand matches the directions and orientations just described.
