Another disadvantage is that the horizontal and vertical patterns depend on each other. If a rhombic 
antenna is made to have a narrow horizontal beam, the beam is also lower in the vertical direction. 
Therefore, obtaining high vertical-angle radiation is impossible except with a very broad horizontal 
pattern and low gain. Rhombic antennas are used, however, for long-distance sky wave coverage at the 
high frequencies. Under these conditions low vertical angles of radiation (less than 20 degrees) are 
desirable. With the rhombic antenna, a considerable amount of the input power is dissipated uselessly in 
the terminating resistor. However, this resistor is necessary to make the antenna unidirectional. The great 
gain of the antenna more than makes up for this loss.
