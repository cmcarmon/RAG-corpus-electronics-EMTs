The larger mainframe computers (super-computers like the CRAY-1 and CYBER 205) use only 
fixed-word-length storage. Most microcomputers use the variable-word-length approach allowing them to 
operate on one character at a time. Somewhere in between these two extremes are the dozens of existing 
minicomputer and mainframe models that have what is called built-in flexibility.
