In the example of Fig. 25.19, the areas of the cells are nonuniform. However, the assigned cell areas ensure
that the previously described operation occurs so that the balancing criterion is satisﬁed. (The cell areas are
omitted in this ﬁgure, but they correspond to the ones given in Fig. 25.15.) Figure 23.19 illustrates a pass of
the  Fiduccia–Mattheyses  algorithm.  During  this  pass,  six  different  partitions  are  generated,  i.e.,  the  initial
partition and ﬁve additional ones. Note that according to the description of the pass, the number of additional
partitions equals the number of cells in the circuit.
