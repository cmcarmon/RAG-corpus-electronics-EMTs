In the set of equations [W] stands for watts, [VAR] for volt-
ampere reactive, and [VA] for voltampere. Average power
is also called active power, real power or simply power.
Reactive power is also referred to as imaginary power. Reac-
tive power is a useful concept in power systems because the
system voltage is affected by the reactive power ﬂow. The
average power in an inductor or capacitor is zero. By deﬁn-
ition, the reactive power taken by an inductor is positive, and
the reactive power taken by a capacitor is negative. Complex
power representation is useful in calculating the power sup-
plied by the source to a number of loads connected in the
system.
