These  points  indicate  that  even  in  SDS  environments,  there  is  an  opportunity  to  employ  wireless  devices.
Wiring—the  expense,  time,  and  inﬂexibility  of  installing,  moving,  and  changing—limits  the  way  companies
can productively use networks. To stay productive, these LANs have to move and change with the workforce
they support. Therefore, a wireless offering must be a complementary solution for buildings with an SDS, in
bringing wireless ﬂexibility and extensibility to today’s networks.
