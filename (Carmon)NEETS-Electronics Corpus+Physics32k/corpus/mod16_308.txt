Most dc instruments use meters based on some form of the D’Arsonval meter movement. In
D’Arsonval-type meters, the length of the conductor and the strength of the field between the poles of the
magnet are fixed. Therefore, any change in current causes a proportional change in the force acting on the
coil. Figure 3-2 is a simplified diagram showing the principle of the D’Arsonval movement.
