The S model for the MOSFET discussed thus far is actually a gross simplifica-
tion of the actual properties of the MOSFET. In particular, a practical MOSFET
displays a non-zero resistance between its D and S terminals when it is on.17
Accordingly, a slightly more accurate model for the MOSFET uses a resistance
RON in place of the short between D and S when the MOSFET is on. Figure 6.29
shows the Switch-Resistor model (or SR model) of the n-channel MOSFET.
