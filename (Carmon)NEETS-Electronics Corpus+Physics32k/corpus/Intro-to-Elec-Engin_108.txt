(ii) For gR = 1, Req → ∞. The internal controlled source provides all of the current
(iii) For gR = 2, Req = −R, which is a negative equivalent resistance. This means that
the controlled source provides more current than that going through R; the current
direction of i is reversed when v > 0. However, the relation v = Reqi is satisﬁed at
the input terminals.
