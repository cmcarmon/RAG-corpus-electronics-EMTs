All crystals whose structures possess one of these symmetry groups will exhibit both pyroelectric and 
electric 
which are a subset of the set of pyroelectrics, the orientation of the
polar  axis  can  be  changed  by  application  of  an  electric  ﬁeld  of  sufﬁcient  magnitude.  The  original  and  ﬁnal
states of the crystal are symmetrically related. It is important to note that
