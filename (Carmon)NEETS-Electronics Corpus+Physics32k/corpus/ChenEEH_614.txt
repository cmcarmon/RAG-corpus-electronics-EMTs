This chapter describes two arithmetic systems that employ
nonstandard encoding of numbers. The logarithmic number
system (LNS) and the residue number system (RNS) are
singled out because they have been shown to offer important
advantages in the efﬁciency of their operation and may be at
the same time more power- or energy-efﬁcient, faster, and/or
smaller than other systems.
