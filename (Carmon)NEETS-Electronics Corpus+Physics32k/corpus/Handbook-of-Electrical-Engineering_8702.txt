High-level  languages  (HLLs),  also  known  as  higher-order  lan-
guages  (HOLs),  have  a  rich  history  in  the  annals  of  computing.
From  their  inception  in  the  1950s  until  advances  in  the  1970s,
HLLs were thought of as simple mechanical levers for producing
machine-level instructions (see Table 87.3). Removing the details
of the underlying machine, and automatically converting from a
HLL statement to an equivalent machine-level statement, releases
the programmer from the drudgery of the computer, allowing one
to concentrate on the solution to the problem at hand.
