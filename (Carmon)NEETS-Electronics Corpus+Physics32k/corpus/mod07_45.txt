Many other materials were tried and tested for use in communications. SILICON was found to be the
most stable of the materials tested while GALENA, a crystalline form of lead sulfide, was found the most
sensitive for use in early radio receivers. By 1915, Carl Beredicks discovered that GERMANIUM,
another metallic element, also had rectifying capabilities. Later, it became widely used in electronics for
low-power, low-frequency applications.
