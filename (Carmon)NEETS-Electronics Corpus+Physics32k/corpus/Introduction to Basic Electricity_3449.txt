The materials used for components and conductors 
are deposited on the substrate using an evaporation or 
sputtering process. The evaporation process requires 
that the material deposited on the substrate be placed 
in a vacuum and heated until it evaporates. The vapors 
are then allowed to condense on the substrate, form-
ing a thin film.
