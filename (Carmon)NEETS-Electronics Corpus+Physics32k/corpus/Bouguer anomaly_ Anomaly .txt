{\displaystyle g_{B}}

s




{\displaystyle g_{obs}}
is the observed gravity;





g

λ




{\displaystyle g_{\lambda }}
is the correction for latitude (because the Earth is not a perfect sphere);




δ

g

F




{\displaystyle \delta g_{F}}
is the free-air correction;




δ

g

B




{\displaystyle \delta g_{B}}
is the Bouguer correction which allows for the gravitational attraction of rocks between the measurement point and sea level;





g

F




{\displaystyle g_{F}}
is the free-air gravity anomaly.




δ

g

T




{\displaystyle \delta g_{T}}
is a terrain correction which allows for deviations of the surface from an infinite horizontal plane
A Bouguer reduction is called simple or incomplete if the terrain is approximated by an infinite flat plate called the Bouguer plate. A refined or complete Bouguer reduction removes the effects of terrain precisely. The difference between the two, the differential gravitational effect of the unevenness of the terrain, is called the terrain effect. It is always negative.
