1.3.3 Determine v, i, and the power delivered to el-
ements in the network given in Figure P1.3.3.
Check whether conservation of power is satisﬁed
by the circuit.
given that i1 = 4 A; i3(t ) = 5e
cos 2t, ﬁnd v1, v2, v3, v4, i2, and i5.
1.3.5 For the circuit given in Figure P1.3.5, given that
VAC = 10 V and VBD = 20 V, determine V1
