Even  for  a  system  that  implements  write-through,  care  must  be  exercised  if  memory  requests  bypass  the
cache. While the main memory is never stale, a write that bypasses the cache, such as from I/O, could have the
effect of making the cached copy stale. A later access by the CPU could then provide an incorrect value. This
can  only  be  avoided  by  making  sure  that  cached  entries  are  invalidated  even  if  the  cache  is  bypassed.  The
problem is relatively easy to solve for a single processor with I/O, but becomes very difÔ¨Åcult to solve for multiple
coherence
processors, particularly so if multiple caches are involved as well. This is known in general as the cache 
or
