In physical terms, EMFs can be regarded as circuit elements which put energy into a circuit
and a resistor R as an element which removes energy from a circuit. The energy is dissipated
in the resistor as heat. In AC circuits we have the additional circuit elements, capacitance C
and inductance L, which store energy in electric and magnetic Ô¨Åelds respectively. C and L
are referred to as reactive elements while R is a resistive element. All three of these element
are considered passive elements. We will encounter active circuit elements in the lectures
to follow. For simplicity we will ignore radiation that might be emitted by high frequency
circuits.
