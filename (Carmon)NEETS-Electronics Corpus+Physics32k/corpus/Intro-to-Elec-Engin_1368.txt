14.3.6 Two noisy ampliﬁers (with noise temperatures
Ta1 and Ta2) having the same bandwidth are con-
nected in cascade so that the overall gain is G
= G1G2. If the input noise to the ﬁrst ampliﬁer
is N = kTB, determine the total output noise
power and the effective noise temperature Ta of
the cascade, so that Nout = Gk(T + Ta)B.
