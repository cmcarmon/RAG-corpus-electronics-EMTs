As in the case of three-phase circuits under balanced conditions, only one phase needs to
be considered for circuit computations, because the conditions in the other two phases are the
same except for the phase displacements associated with a three-phase system. It is usually
convenient to carry out the analysis on a per-phase-of-Y (i.e., line-to-neutral) basis, and in such
a case the transformer series impedance can then be added in series with the transmission-line
series impedance. In dealing with Y– and –Y connections, all quantities can be referred to
the Y-connected side. For – connections, it is convenient to replace the -connected series
impedances of the transformers with equivalent Y-connected impedances by using the relation
