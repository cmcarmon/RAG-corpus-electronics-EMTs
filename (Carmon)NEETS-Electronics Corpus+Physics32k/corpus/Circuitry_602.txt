An FM transmitter 
 
Figure 13.9 shows the block schematic of a simple 
FM transmitter. Once again, an accurate and stable 
RF oscillator generates the radio frequency carrier 
signal.  As  with  the  AM  transmitter,  the  output  of 
this stage is amplified and passed to an RF power 
amplifier  stage.  Here  again,  the  inclusion  of  an 
amplifier  between  the  RF  oscillator  and  the  RF 
power stage helps to improve frequency stability.  
  The  low-level  signal  from  the  microphone  is 
amplified using an AF amplifier before it is passed 
to  a  variable  reactance  element  (e.g.  a  variable 
capacitance  diodeâ€”see  page  93)  within  the  RF 
oscillator  tuned  circuit.  The  application  of  the  AF 
signal to the variable reactance element causes the 
frequency  of  the  RF  oscillator  to  increase  and 
decrease in sympathy with the AF signal. 
  The final RF signal from the power amplifier is 
passed  through  an  aerial  tuning  unit  that  matches 
the aerial to the RF power amplifier and also helps 
to  reduce  the  level  of  any  unwanted  harmonic 
components that may be present. As with the final 
stages  of  an  AM  transmitter,  the  RF  power 
amplifier usually operates at an appreciable power 
level and this uses Class C to increase efficiency.
