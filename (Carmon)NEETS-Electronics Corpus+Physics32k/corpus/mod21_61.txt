A major advantage of using an oscilloscope for ac voltage measurements is that the waveform can be
observed; consequently, errors in measuring complex peak voltages are minimized. An oscilloscope may
be used as a high-impedance ac voltmeter. In standard oscilloscopes, the vertical amplifier input
impedance is generally greater than 1 megohm, making it possible to measure voltages in high-impedance
circuits. If the signal is applied directly to the plates, rather than at the vertical amplifier input, the input
impedance is increased considerably.
