Our third step involves writing the KVL and KCL equations for the circuit.
For KVL, one possible choice of closed paths is shown in Figure 2.47. If we
assign the polarity to a voltage in accordance with the first sign encountered,
we see that for Loop 1, v5 and v2 are negative, v1 is positive. The corresponding
KVL equations are
