The modulated visual intermediate frequency (IF) signal is band-shaped in a vestigial sideband ﬁlter, typically
a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) ﬁlter. Envelope-delay correction is not required for the SAW ﬁlter because of
the  uniform  delay  characteristics  of  the  device.  Envelope-delay  compensation  may,  however,  be  needed  for
other parts of the transmitter. The SAW ﬁlter provides many beneﬁts to transmitter designers and operators.
