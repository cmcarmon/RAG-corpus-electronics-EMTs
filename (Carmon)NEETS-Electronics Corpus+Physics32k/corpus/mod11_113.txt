The variation in grid voltage causes the electrons to enter the space between the grid and the repeller 
at various velocities. For example, in figure 2-10, views (A) and (B), the electrons at times 1 and 2 are 
speeded up as they pass through the grid. At time 3, the field is passing through zero and the electron is 
unaffected. At times 4 and 5, the grid field is reversed; the electrons give up energy because their velocity 
is reduced as they pass through the grids.
