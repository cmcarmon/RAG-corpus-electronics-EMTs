After you have adjusted the ohmmeter for zero reading, it is ready to be connected to a circuit to
measure resistance. A typical circuit and ohmmeter arrangement is shown in figure 3-13. You must
ensure that the power switch of the circuit to be measured is in the de-energized (OFF) position. This
prevents the source voltage of the circuit from being applied to the meter, a condition that could cause
severe damage to the meter movement.
