Example 14.4 
 
A 20  kG
/V  meter  is  switched  to  the  10  V  range. 
What  current  will  flow  in  the  meter  when  it  is 
connected to a 6 V source? 
 
Solution 
 
The resistance of the meter will be given by: 
 
Rm = 10 Ã— 20 kG = 200 kG
The current flowing in the meter will thus be given 
by: 
I
