The  cause  of  an  EMI  problem  is  an  unplanned  coupling  between  a  source  and  a  receptor  by  means  of  a
transmission path. Transmission paths may be conducted or radiated. Conducted interference occurs by means
of metallic paths. Radiated interference occurs by means of near- and far- Ô¨Åeld coupling. These different paths
are illustrated in Fig. 40.1.
