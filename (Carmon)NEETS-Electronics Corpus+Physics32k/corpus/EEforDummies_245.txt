others hold on tight to their electrons. Just how strongly a specific materi Â­
 al opposes the flow of electrons determines its resistivity. Resistivity is 
a property of a material that reflects its chemical structure. Conductors 
have relatively low resistivity, whereas insulators have relatively high 
resistivity.
