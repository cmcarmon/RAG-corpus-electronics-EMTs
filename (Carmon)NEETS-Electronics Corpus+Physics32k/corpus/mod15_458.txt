STATORâ€”The stationary member of a synchro that consists of a cylindrical structure of slotted
laminations on which three Y-connected coils are wound with their axes 120 apart.
Depending on the type of synchro, the stator's functions are similar to the primary or
secondary windings of a transformer.
