Harvard  architecture. This  means 
they 
contain completely separate memory and buses for 
program  instructions  and  data  memory.  Program 
memory  can  be  ROM,  EPROM  or  Flash,  whereas 
data  memory  must  be 
read/write  memory 
(commonly known as RAM). 
  Mainstream  microprocessors  (like  the  Z80  that 
we met in Chapter 11) are categorized in terms of 
the  number  of  data  bits  that  they  can  manipulate 
(i.e. the ‘width’ of the data bus). They can be 8-bit, 
16-bit,  32-bit  and  64-bit  and  128-bit  devices.  PIC 
microcontrollers, by contrast, are all based on an 8-
bit  data  bus  and,  because  of  this,  they  can  only 
operate on 8-bits of data at a time (despite this, you 
will 
that 
reference  more  data  bits,  i.e.  12-bits,  14-bits  and 
16-bits). Furthermore, although the data memory is 
8-bits  wide  for  all  PIC  microcontrollers, 
the 
program memory varies from 12-bits to 16-bits.
