A fractionally spaced transversal equalizer [Monsen, 1971] is shown in Fig. 70.9. The delay-line taps of such
an  equalizer  are  spaced  at  an  interval t,  which  is  less  than,  or  a  fraction  of,  the  symbol  interval  T.  The  tap
spacing t  is  typically  selected  such  that  the  bandwidth  occupied  by  the  signal  at  the  equalizer  input  is *f *  <
