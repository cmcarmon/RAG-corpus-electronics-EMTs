constant must also change. For a given mode, a change in wavelength can prevent the mode from
propagating along the fiber. The mode is no longer bound to the fiber. The mode is said to be cut off.
Modes that are bound at one wavelength may not exist at longer wavelengths. The wavelength at which a
mode ceases to be bound is called the cutoff wavelength for that mode. However, an optical fiber is
always able to propagate at least one mode. This mode is referred to as the fundamental mode of the fiber.
The fundamental mode can never be cut off. The wavelength that prevents the next higher mode from
propagating is called the cutoff wavelength of the fiber. An optical fiber that operates above the cutoff
wavelength (at a longer wavelength) is called a single mode fiber. An optical fiber that operates below the
cutoff wavelength is called a multimode fiber. Single mode and multimode optical fibers are discussed
later in this chapter.
