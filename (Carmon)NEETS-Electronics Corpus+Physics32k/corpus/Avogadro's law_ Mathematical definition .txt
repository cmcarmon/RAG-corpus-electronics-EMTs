Avogadro's law is stated mathematically as






V
n


=
k
,


{\displaystyle {\frac {V}{n}}=k,}

where:
V is the volume of the gas(es),
n is the number of particles
k is a proportionality constant.
The most significant consequence of Avogadro's law is that the ideal gas constant has the same value for all gases. This means that

{\displaystyle {\frac {p_{1}\cdot V_{1}}{T_{1}\cdot n_{1}}}={\frac {p_{2}\cdot V_{2}}{T_{2}\cdot n_{2}}}={\text{constant}},}

where:
p is the pressure of the gas in the cell,
T is the temperature of the gas in kelvins.
