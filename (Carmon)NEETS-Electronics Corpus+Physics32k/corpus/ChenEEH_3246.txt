In equation 6.2, the ra is the resistance of a feeder conductor
from regulator station to regulation point, V/mi per con-
ductor; s1 is the length of three-phase feeder between regulator
station and substation, mi (multiply length by 2 if feeder is in
single-phase); and l is the primary feeder length, mi.
