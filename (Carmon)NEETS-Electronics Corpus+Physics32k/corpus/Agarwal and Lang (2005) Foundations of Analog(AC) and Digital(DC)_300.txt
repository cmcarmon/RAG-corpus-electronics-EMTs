Now compare Equations 2.33 and 2.34 to Equations 2.21 and 2.22. The important
observation here is that they are the same except for the polarity reversal of the solutions
for i2 and v2. This must be the case because the circuits in Figures 2.25 and 2.27 are
physically the same, and so their branch variables must also be physically the same. Since
we have chosen to define two of these branch variables with different polarities in the
two figures, the signs of their values must differ accordingly so that they describe the
same physical branch current and voltage.
