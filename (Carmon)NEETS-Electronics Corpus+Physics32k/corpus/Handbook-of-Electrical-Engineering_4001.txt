MESFETs can be optimized for small-signal, low-noise operation or for large-signal, RF power applications.
Generally,  low-noise  operation  requires  short  gate  lengths,  relatively  narrow  gate  widths,  and  highly  doped
channels. Power devices generally have longer gate lengths, much wider gate widths, and lower doped channels.
Low-noise  devices  can  be  fabricated  that  operate  with  good  gain  (;10  dB)  and  low  noise  Ô¨Ågure  (<3  dB)  to
above 100 GHz. Power devices can provide RF power levels on the order of watts (W) up to over 20 GHz.
