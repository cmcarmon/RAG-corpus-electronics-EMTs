The scanning and color-decoding circuits in receivers must follow the frequency and phase of the synchro-
nizing signals to produce a stable and geometrically accurate image of the proper color  hue and saturation.
Any change in timing of successive vertical scans can impair the interlace of the even and odd ﬁelds in a frame.
Small errors in horizontal scan timing of lines in a ﬁeld can result in a loss of resolution in vertical line structures.
Periodic  errors  over  several  lines  that  may  be  out  of  the  range  of  the  horizontal  scan  automatic  frequency
control circuit in the receiver will be evident as jagged vertical lines.
