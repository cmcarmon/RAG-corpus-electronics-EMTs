Terminal ballistics is the study of the behavior and effects of a projectile when it hits its target.
Terminal ballistics is relevant both for small caliber projectiles as well as for large caliber projectiles (fired from artillery). The study of extremely high velocity impacts is still very new and is as yet mostly applied to spacecraft design.
