Although  externally  modulated  systems  are  immune  to  chirp-related  problems,  ﬁber  nonlinearity,  in  the
form  of  stimulated  Brillouin  scattering  (SBS),  places  a  limit  on  the  launched  power.  SBS,  in  which  light  is
scattered from acoustic phonons in the ﬁber, causes a rapid decrease in CNR for launched powers greater than
approximately 10 mW [Mao et al., 1991]. Since the SBS process requires high optical powers within a narrow
optical spectral width (20 MHz), it is a problem only in low-chirp externally modulated systems. Chirp in DFB
systems broadens the optical spectrum so that SBS is unimportant.
