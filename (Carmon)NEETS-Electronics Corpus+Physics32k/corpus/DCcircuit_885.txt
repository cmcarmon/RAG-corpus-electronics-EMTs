Unfortunately, though, the accurate averaging of these Seebeck voltage potentials relies on
each thermocoupleâ€™s wire resistances being equal. If the thermocouples are located at different
places and their wires join in parallel at a single location, equal wire length will be unlikely.
The thermocouple having the greatest wire length from point of measurement to parallel con-
nection point will tend to have the greatest resistance, and will therefore have the least effect
on the average voltage produced.
