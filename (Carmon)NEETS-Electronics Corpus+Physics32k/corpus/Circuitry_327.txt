Measurements and calculations 
For  each  circuit,  record  your  results  in  a  table 
showing  corresponding  values  of  IL and  VL (see 
Tables 6.1 and 6.2).  
  Plot graphs showing VL plotted against IL for each 
circuit (see Figures 6.34 and 6.35). By constructing 
a tangent  to  each  graph,  determine  the  output 
resistance of each regulator circuit. For the simple 
shunt  zener  diode  regulator  the  output  resistance 
should  be  calculated  at  IL = 30  mA  whilst  for  the 
transistor  voltage  regulator  the  output  resistance 
should be calculated at IL = 100 mA.
