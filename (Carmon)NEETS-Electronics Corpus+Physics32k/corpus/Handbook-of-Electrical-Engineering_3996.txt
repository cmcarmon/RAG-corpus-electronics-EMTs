Although the two-terminal active devices are used in many electronic systems, the one-port characteristic
can introduce signiÔ¨Åcant complexity into circuit design. Isolators and circulators are generally required, and
these  components  are  often  large  and  bulky.  They  are  often  fabricated  from  magnetic  materials,  which  can
introduce thermal sensitivities. For these reasons three-terminal devices have replaced two-terminal devices in
many practical applications. Generally, if two-terminal and three-terminal devices with comparable capability
