Some systems transmit simultaneously two linear orthogonal polarizations that are not in
time phase. Elliptical polarization results when the two linear components have arbitrary relative
amplitudes and arbitrary time phase. Circular polarization (probably the most useful type) is a
special case in which the horizontal and vertical electric ﬁelds are 90° out of time phase and have
equal magnitude. Left-hand circular polarization results when the horizontal radiation component
lags the vertical one by 90° and the resultant ﬁeld appears to rotate counterclockwise in the xy-
plane with time, as one located at the antenna views the wave leaving the antenna. If the horizontal
component leads the vertical one by 90°, right-hand circular polarization is said to take place.
