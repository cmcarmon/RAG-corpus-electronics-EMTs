We  know  from  elementary  physics  that  all  matter  is  made  of  funda-
mental building blocks known as atoms and that each atom consists of
electrons, protons, and neutrons. We also know that the charge e on an
electron is negative and equal in magnitude to 
C, while
a  proton  carries  a  positive  charge  of  the  same  magnitude  as  the  elec-
tron. The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves an
atom neutrally charged.
