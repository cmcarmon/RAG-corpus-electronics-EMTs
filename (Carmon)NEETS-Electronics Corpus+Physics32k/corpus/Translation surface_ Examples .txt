The simplest example of a translation surface is obtained by gluing the opposite sides of a parallelogram. It is a flat torus with no singularities.
If

If

{\displaystyle P}
is obtained by putting side to side a collection of copies of the unit square than any translation surface obtained from

{\displaystyle P}
is called a square-tiled surface. The map from the surface to the flat torus obtained by identifying all squares is a branched covering with branch points the singularities (the cone angle at a singularity is proportional to the degree of branching).
