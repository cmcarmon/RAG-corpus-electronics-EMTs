Nehrbass et al. (1996) showed that such an algorithm is
numerically stable within the Courant limit. Further, Abarba-
nel and Gottlieb (1997) showed that the resulting discrete
ﬁelds satisfy Gauss’s law, and the UPML is well posed. Finally,
Gedney and Taﬂove (2000) discussed how the UPML formu-
lation in both the frequency domain and the time domain can
be extended to terminate material regions in the FDTD space
grid that are either electrically lossy or have frequency-disper-
sive dielectric parameters.
