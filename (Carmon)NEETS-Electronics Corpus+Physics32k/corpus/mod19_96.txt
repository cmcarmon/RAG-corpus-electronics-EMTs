NEVER apply a tourniquet unless the hemorrhage is so severe that it cannot 
be controlled in any other way. By the time the tourniquet is required, the victim 
will have lost a considerable amount of blood; therefore, once a tourniquet has been 
applied, it should be released only by medical personnel.
