Field  propagator: The  analytical  description  of  how  electromagnetic  ﬁelds  are  related  to  the  sources  that
cause them. Common ﬁeld propagators in electromagnetics are the deﬁning Maxwell equations that lead
to differential equation models, Green’s functions that produce integral equation models, optical prop-
agators that lead to optics models, and multipole expansions that lead to modal models.
