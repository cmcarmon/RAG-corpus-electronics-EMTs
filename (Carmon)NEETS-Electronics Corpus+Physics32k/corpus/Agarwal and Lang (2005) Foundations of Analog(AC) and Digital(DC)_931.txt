Chapter 6 introduced the MOSFET and developed simple digital logic circuits
using the device. That chapter also used the simplistic S model and the SR
model of the MOSFET to analyze digital logic circuits. The SR model uses a
fixed RON between the D and S terminals of the MOSFET when vGS â‰¥ VT.
This model is a reasonable representation of MOSFET behavior only when the
drain voltage is smaller than the gate voltage minus one threshold drop. In other
words, when
