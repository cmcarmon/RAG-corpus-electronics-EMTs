straight  line.  This  is  always  the  case  when  two 
variables are directly proportional to one another. 
It is conventional to show the dependent variable 
 
(in this case it is current, i) plotted on the vertical 
axis and the independent variable (in this case it is 
voltage,  v) plotted  on  the  horizontal  axis.  If  you 
find  these  terms  a  little  confusing,  just  remember 
that,  what  you  know  is  usually  plotted  on  the 
horizontal  scale  whilst  what  you  donâ€™t  know  (and 
may  be  trying  to  find)  is  usually  plotted  on  the 
vertical scale. In fact, the graph contains the same 
information  regardless  of  which  way  round  it  is 
drawn!
