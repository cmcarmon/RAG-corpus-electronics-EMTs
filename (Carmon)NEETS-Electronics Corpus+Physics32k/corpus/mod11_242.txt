The GUNN OSCILLATOR is a source of microwave energy that uses the bulk-effect, gallium-
arsenide semiconductor. The basic frequency of a gunn oscillator is inversely proportional to the transit 
time of a domain across the semiconductor. The transit time is proportional to the length of 
semiconductor material, and to some extent, the voltage applied. Each domain causes a pulse of current at 
the output; thus, the output is a frequency determined by the physical length of the semiconductor chip.
