There are several ways of doing mechanical work, each in some way related to a force acting through a distance. In basic mechanics, the work done by a constant force F on a body displaced a distance s in the direction of the force is given by




W

s



{\displaystyle W=Fs\,}

If the force is not constant, the work done is obtained by integrating the differential amount of work,
