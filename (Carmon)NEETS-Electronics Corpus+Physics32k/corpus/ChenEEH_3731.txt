Ultimately, node (I, J ) is reached in the search process
through the sequential updates, and the cost of the globally
optimal path is Dmin(I, J ). To actually locate the optimal path,
it is necessary to use a backtracking procedure. Once the
optimal path to (i, j) is found, we record the immediate
predecessor node, nominally at a memory location attached
to (i, j). Let us deÔ¨Åne:
