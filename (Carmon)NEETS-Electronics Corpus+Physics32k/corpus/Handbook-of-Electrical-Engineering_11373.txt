Imaging
As  shown  in  Fig.  116.3,  one  method  for  imaging  utilizes  a  transmit/receive  coil  to  emit  a  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld  at
frequency f0 which is the Larmour frequency of plane P. Subsequently, magnetic gradients are applied in the y
and x directions. The detected signal during the data collection window can be expressed as
