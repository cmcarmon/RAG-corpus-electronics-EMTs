The suffix



P


{\displaystyle P}
indicates that we are following the motion of a fluid particle. Note that at point

{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}_{P}}
the curve is parallel to the flow velocity vector

{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}}
, where the velocity vector is evaluated at the position of the particle
