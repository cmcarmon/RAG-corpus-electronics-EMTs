The free model follows the Drude model in which four basic assumptions are taken into account:
Free electron approximation
The interaction between the ions and the valence electrons is mostly neglected, except in boundary conditions. The ions only keep the charge neutrality in the metal. In contrast with Drude model, the ions are not necessarily the source of collisions.
Independent electron approximation
The interactions between electrons are ignored. The electrostatic fields in metals are weak because of the screening effect.
Relaxation-time approximation
There is some unknown scattering mechanism such that the electron probability of collision is inversely proportional to the relaxation time



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
, which represents the average time between collisions. The collisions do not depend on the electronic configuration.
Pauli exclusion principle
Each quantum state of the system must be occupied by a single electron. This restriction of available electron states is taken into account by Fermi–Dirac statistics (see also Fermi gas). Main predictions of the free-electron model are derived by the Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi–Dirac occupancy for energies around the Fermi level.
The crystal lattice is not explicitly taken into account in the free electron model, but a quantum-mechanical justification is given by Bloch's Theorem: an unbound electron moves in a periodic potential as a free electron in vacuum, except for the electron mass m becoming an effective mass m* which may deviate considerably from m (one can even use negative effective mass to describe conduction by electron holes). Effective masses can be derived from band structure computations that were not originally taken into account in the free electron model.
