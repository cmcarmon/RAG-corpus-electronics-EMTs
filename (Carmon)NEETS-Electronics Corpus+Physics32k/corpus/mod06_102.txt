The envelope of a tube may be made of ceramic, metal, or glass. Its major purpose is to keep the
vacuum in and the atmosphere out. The main reason for this is that the heated filament would burn up in
the atmosphere. There are other reasons for providing a vacuum, but the important thing is to realize that
a tube with a leaky envelope will not function properly.
