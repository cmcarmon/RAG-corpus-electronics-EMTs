Voltage multipliers may be classified as voltage doublers, triplers, or quadruplers. The classification 
depends on the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage. For example, a voltage multiplier that 
increases the peak input voltage twice is called a voltage doubler. Voltage multipliers increase voltages 
through the use of series-aiding voltage sources. This can be compared to the connection of dry cells 
(batteries) in series.
