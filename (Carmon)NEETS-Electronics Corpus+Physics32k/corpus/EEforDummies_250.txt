Although a resistor won’t boost current or control its direction (because it’s 
passive), you’ll find it to be a powerful little device because it enables you to 
put the brakes on current flow in a controlled way. By carefully choosing and 
arranging resistors in different parts of your circuit, you can control just how 
much — or how little — current each part of your circuit gets.
