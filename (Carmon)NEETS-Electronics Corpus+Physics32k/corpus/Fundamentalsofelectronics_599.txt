In complexity calculations, we only worry about what happens as the data lengths increase, and take the
dominant term—here the 4N 2 term—as reﬂecting how much work is involved in making the computation.
As multiplicative constants don’t matter since we are making a “proportional to” evaluation, we ﬁnd the
