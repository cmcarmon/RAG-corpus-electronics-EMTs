The SPARK-GAP MODULATOR consists of a circuit for storing energy, a circuit for rapidly
discharging the storage circuit (spark gap), a pulse transformer, and an ac power source. The circuit for
storing energy is essentially a short section of artificial transmission line which is known as the
PULSE-FORMING NETWORK (pfn). The pulse-forming network is discharged by a spark gap. Two
types of spark gaps are used: FIXED GAPS and ROTARY GAPS. The fixed gap, discussed in this
section, uses a trigger pulse to ionize the air between the contacts of the spark gap and to initiate the
discharge of the pulse-forming network. The rotary gap is similar to a mechanically driven switch.
