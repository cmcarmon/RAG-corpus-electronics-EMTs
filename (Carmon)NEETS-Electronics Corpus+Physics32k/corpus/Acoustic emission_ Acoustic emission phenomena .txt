Acoustic emission is the transient elastic waves within a material, caused by the rapid release of localized stress energy. An event source is the phenomenon which releases elastic energy into the material, which then propagates as an elastic wave. Acoustic emissions can be detected in frequency ranges under 1 kHz, and have been reported at frequencies up to 100 MHz, but most of the released energy is within the 1 kHz to 1 MHz range. Rapid stress-releasing events generate a spectrum of stress waves starting at 0 Hz, and typically falling off at several MHz.
The three major applications of AE techniques are: 1) source location - determine the locations where an event source occurred; 2) material mechanical performance - evaluate and characterize materials/structures; and 3) health monitoring - monitor the safe operation of a structure, for example, bridges, pressure containers, and pipe lines, etc.
More recent research has focused on using AE to not only locate but also to characterise the source mechanisms such as crack growth, friction, delamination, matrix cracking, etc. This would give AE the ability to tell the end user what source mechanism is present and allow them to determine whether structural repairs are necessary.
AE can be related to an irreversible release of energy. It can also be generated from sources not involving material failure, including friction, cavitation and impact.
