resistor. For instance, you can simulate the operation of a traffic light by 
tying outputs 0–4 together and feeding the result (through a resistor) into a 
red LED, connecting output 5 to a yellow LED, and tying outputs 6–9 together 
to control a green LED. (See the traffic light project in Chapter 17.)
