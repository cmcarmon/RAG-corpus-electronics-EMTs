Mass may be considered also. Taking



Q
=
0


{\displaystyle Q=0}
(no sources or sinks of mass) and putting in density:







∂
ρ


∂
t



+
∇
⋅
(
ρ

u

)
=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0}

where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density (mass per unit volume), and




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
is the flow velocity. This equation is called the mass continuity equation, or simply "the" continuity equation. This equation generally accompanies the Navier–Stokes equation.
In the case of an incompressible fluid,






D
ρ


D
t



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {D\rho }{Dt}}=0}
(i.e. the density following the path of a fluid element is constant) and the equation reduces to:




∇
⋅

u

=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0}

which is in fact a statement of the conservation of volume.
