One network may have many network functions. The
number depends on where we apply the independent source,
which source we select, and where we take the output. To be
able to deÔ¨Åne the network function, we must satisfy two
conditions: (1) the network is linear, and (2) there are zero
initial conditions on capacitors and inductors.
