can withstand a brief period of overloading before it 
blows. This brief period of overloading occurs because 
the fuse wire heats more slowly. If the overload is pres-
ent for longer than a few seconds, it blows the fuse. A 
slow-blow fuse may contain a spring for pulling the 
fuse wire apart once it melts. Some circuits can with-
stand a surge in current. In these, a slow-blow fuse is 
preferable to a normal fuse.
