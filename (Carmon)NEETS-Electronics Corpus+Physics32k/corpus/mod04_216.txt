Insulation Removalâ€”The first step in splicing or terminating electrical conductors is to remove the 
insulation. The preferred method for stripping wire is by use of a wire-stripping tool. The hot-blade 
stripper cannot be used on such insulation material as glass braid or asbestos. An alternate method for 
stripping copper wire is with a knife. A knife is the required tool to strip aluminum wire. Take extreme 
care when stripping aluminum wire. Knicking the strands will cause them to break easily.
