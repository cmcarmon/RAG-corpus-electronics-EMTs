3.1
Having understood the fundamental laws of circuit theory (Ohm’s law
and  Kirchhoff’s  laws),  we  are  now  prepared  to  apply  these  laws  to
develop  two  powerful  techniques  for  circuit  analysis:  nodal  analysis,
which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff’s current law
(KCL), and mesh analysis, which is based on a systematic application
of  Kirchhoff’s  voltage  law  (KVL).  The  two  techniques  are  so  impor-
tant  that  this  chapter  should  be  regarded  as  the  most  important  in  the
book. Students are therefore encouraged to pay careful attention.
