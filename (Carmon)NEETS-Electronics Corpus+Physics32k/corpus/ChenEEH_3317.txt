As compared with the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, each iter-
ation step in the NR algorithm is computationally much
more intensive because of (a) evaluating the Jacobian and (b)
solving the linear equations 7.55. On the other hand, the error
convergence rate of the NR algorithm is spectacularly faster,
and hence, the NR algorithm requires much fewer iterations to
reach comparable solution accuracies. In usual practice, the
Gauss-Seidel algorithm is used only for ï¬‚at starts with poorly
known initial conditions. In most other situations, the NR
algorithm is the preferred choice.
