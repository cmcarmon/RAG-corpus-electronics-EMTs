The ViewSonic® VP140 ViewPanel is about as ﬂat as a board. This new active-matrix LCD
ﬂat-panel  has  a  14-in.  viewing  area.  Measuring  at  only  2.5  in.  deep  and  weighing  just
12.1 lb, the VP140 weighs only a fraction of standard displays and uses 90% less desktop
space. The display unit supports a maximum noninterlaced resolution of 1024 · 768 pixels
at  a  75-Hz  refresh  rate.  Additionally,  the  VP140  monitor  can  be  conﬁgured  for  both
desktop or slim line wall displays and it supports up to 16.7 million color images for both
PC and Macintosh® environments. This revolutionary view panel represents the future of
monitors. (Photo courtesy of ViewSonic Corporation.)
