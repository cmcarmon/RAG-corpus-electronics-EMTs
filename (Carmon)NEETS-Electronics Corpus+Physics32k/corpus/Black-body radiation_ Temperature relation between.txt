The black-body law may be used to estimate the temperature of a planet orbiting the Sun.

The temperature of a planet depends on several factors:
Incident radiation from its star
Emitted radiation of the planet, e.g., Earth's infrared glow
The albedo effect causing a fraction of light to be reflected by the planet
The greenhouse effect for planets with an atmosphere
Energy generated internally by a planet itself due to radioactive decay, tidal heating, and adiabatic contraction due by cooling.
The analysis only considers the Sun's heat for a planet in a Solar System.
The Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the total power (energy/second) the Sun is emitting:

{\displaystyle T_{\rm {S}}\,}

The Sun emits that power equally in all directions. Because of this, the planet is hit with only a tiny fraction of it. The power from the Sun that strikes the planet (at the top of the atmosphere) is:

where

{\displaystyle R_{\rm {E}}\,}

Because of its high temperature, the Sun emits to a large extent in the ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) frequency range. In this frequency range, the planet reflects a fraction



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
of this energy where



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the albedo or reflectance of the planet in the UV-Vis range. In other words, the planet absorbs a fraction

Even though the planet only absorbs as a circular area

, is known as the effective temperature. The actual temperature of the planet will likely be different, depending on its surface and atmospheric properties. Ignoring the atmosphere and greenhouse effect, the planet, since it is at a much lower temperature than the Sun, emits mostly in the infrared (IR) portion of the spectrum. In this frequency range, it emits

{\displaystyle {\overline {\epsilon }}}

In other words, given the assumptions made, the temperature of a planet depends only on the surface temperature of the Sun, the radius of the Sun, the distance between the planet and the Sun, the albedo and the IR emissivity of the planet.
