Figure 2-44, view (A), shows a circuit application using a voltage-variable capacitor and a pump 
circuit. The pump circuit decreases the capacitance each time the input signal (E) across the capacitor 
reaches maximum. The decreased capacitance causes a voltage buildup as shown by the dotted line in 
view (B). Therefore, each time the pump decreases capacitance (view (C)), energy transfers from the 
pump circuit to the input signal. The step-by-step buildup of the input-signal energy level is shown in 
view (D).
