Heat is a potential source of trouble for semicon-
ductors and is not easy to control. Good circuit  design 
minimizes heat changes. Its resistance is what makes 
silicon preferable to germanium in most  circuits. In 
some applications, heat-sensitive devices are necessary. 
In these applications, the germanium temperature 
 coefficient can be an advantage; therefore, germanium 
is used.
