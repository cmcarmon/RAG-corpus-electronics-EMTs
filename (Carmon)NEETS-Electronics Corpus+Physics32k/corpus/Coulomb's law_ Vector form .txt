Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force F1 experienced by a charge, q1 at position r1, in the vicinity of another charge, q2 at position r2, in a vacuum is equal to:

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F_{1}}}={q_{1}q_{2} \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{({\boldsymbol {r_{1}-r_{2}}}) \over |{\boldsymbol {r_{1}-r_{2}}}|^{3}}={q_{1}q_{2} \over 4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}{{\boldsymbol {{\hat {r}}_{21}}} \over |{\boldsymbol {r_{21}}}|^{2}},}

where r21 = r1 − r2, the unit vector r̂21 = r21/|r21|, and ε0 is the electric constant.
The vector form of Coulomb's law is simply the scalar definition of the law with the direction given by the unit vector, r̂21, parallel with the line from charge q2 to charge q1. If both charges have the same sign (like charges) then the product q1q2 is positive and the direction of the force on q1 is given by r̂21; the charges repel each other. If the charges have opposite signs then the product q1q2 is negative and the direction of the force on q1 is given by −r̂21 = r̂12; the charges attract each other.
The electrostatic force F2 experienced by q2, according to Newton's third law, is F2 = −F1.
