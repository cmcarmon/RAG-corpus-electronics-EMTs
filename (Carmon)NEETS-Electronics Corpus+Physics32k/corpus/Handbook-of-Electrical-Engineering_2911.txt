  A  simpliﬁed  deﬁnition  of  planarity,  which  is  difﬁcult  to  measure.  Coplanarity  is  the  distance
between the highest and lowest leads, and is easily measured by placing the IC on a ﬂat surface such as
a glass plate. The lowest leads will then rest on the plate, and the measured difference to the lead highest
above the plate is the measurement of coplanarity.
