The forms are constructed during palette design using the Forms Editor shown in Fig. 112.15. To the left of
the screen we see the actual parameter form of the Integrator block. In the middle we have the palette from
which the primitive form elements may be picked. Each primitive forms object, such as text/value boxes and
action buttons, have deﬁnable characteristics that will vary from element to element. To the right of Fig. 112.15
we see the characteristics of the data-input box for the parameter “lower limit”.
