High-Speed Adders
Several different adder designs have been developed for performing high-speed addition. These include carry
lookahead adders (CLAs),  carry-completion  adders,  conditional-sum  adders,  and  carry-select  adders.  Carry
lookahead adders have gained wide acceptance in the design of ALUs due to the speed obtained and because
they can be conveniently implemented in integrated circuit form.
