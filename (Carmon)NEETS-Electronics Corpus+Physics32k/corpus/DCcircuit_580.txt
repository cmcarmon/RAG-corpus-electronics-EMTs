Because the circuit is a combination of both series and parallel, we cannot apply the rules
for voltage, current, and resistance ”across the table” to begin analysis like we could when the
circuits were one way or the other. For instance, if the above circuit were simple series, we
could just add up R1 through R4 to arrive at a total resistance, solve for total current, and
then solve for all voltage drops. Likewise, if the above circuit were simple parallel, we could
just solve for branch currents, add up branch currents to ﬁgure the total current, and then
calculate total resistance from total voltage and total current. However, this circuit’s solution
will be more complex.
