In particle physics, neutral particle oscillation is the transmutation of a particle with zero electric charge into another neutral particle due to a change of a non-zero internal quantum number via an interaction that does not conserve that quantum number. For example, a neutron cannot transmute into an antineutron as that would violate the conservation of baryon number.
Such oscillations can be classified into two types:
Particle–antiparticle oscillation (for example, K0–K0 oscillation, B0–B0 oscillation, D0–D0 oscillation).
Flavor oscillation (for example, νe–νμ oscillation).
In case the particles decay to some final product, then the system is not purely oscillatory, and an interference between oscillation and decay is observed.
