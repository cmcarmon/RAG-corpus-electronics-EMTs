Most analog fiber optic communications systems intensity modulate the optical source. In intensity
modulation, the intensity of the optical source's output signal is directly modulated by the incoming
electrical analog baseband signal. A baseband signal is a signal that is in its original form and has not
been changed by a modulation technique.
