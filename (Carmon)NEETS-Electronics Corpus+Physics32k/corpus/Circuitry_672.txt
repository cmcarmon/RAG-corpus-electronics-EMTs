Resistance measurement 
 
Figure  14.20  shows  how 
to  make  resistance 
measurements.  As  before,  the  red  and  black  test 
leads  are  respectively  connected  to  ‘V-OHM’  and 
‘COM’ respectively. In Fig. 14.20, the mode switch 
and range selectors are  set to OHM, 200ohm, and 
the meter indicates a reading of 55.8 G
. Note that it 
is not necessary to ‘zero’ the meter by shorting the 
test 
any 
measurements  (as  would  be  the  case  with  an 
analogue meter). 
 
Capacitance measurement 
 
Many  modern 
digital  multi-range  meters 
incorporate  a  capacitance  measuring  although  this 
may  be  limited  to  just  one  or  two  ranges.  Figure 
14.21  shows  how  to  carry  out  a  capacitance 
measurement. The capacitor on test is inserted into 
the  two-way  connector  marked  ‘CAP’  whilst  the 
mode switch and range selector controls are set to 
DC, 2,000 pF. The display indication shown in Fig. 
14.21 corresponds to a capacitance of 329 pF.
