Although for a well-designed device there is no drain-voltage dependence in subthreshold, gate-bias depen-
dence is exponential. The surface is lowered in energy relative to the semiconductor body by the action of the
gate. If this surface potential is fS below that of the body, the carrier density is enhanced by a Boltzmann factor
exp(qf S /kT) relative to the body concentration, where kT/q = the thermal voltage Â» 25 mV at 290 K. As fS is
roughly proportional to VG, this exponential dependence on fS leads to an exponential dependence upon  VG
for the carrier density and, hence, for the current in subthreshold.
