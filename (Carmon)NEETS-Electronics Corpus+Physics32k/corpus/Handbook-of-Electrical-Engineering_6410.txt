Adaptive Equalization
After the initial training period (if there is one), the coefﬁcients of an adaptive equalizer may be continually
adjusted in a decision-directed manner. In this mode the error signal ek = zk – qk is derived from the ﬁnal (not
necessarily  correct)  receiver  estimate  {qk}  of  the  transmitted  sequence  {xk}  where  qk  is  the  estimate  of  xk.  In
normal operation the receiver decisions are correct with high probability, so that the error estimates are correct
often enough to allow the adaptive equalizer to maintain precise equalization. Moreover, a decision-directed
adaptive equalizer can track slow variations in the channel characteristics or linear perturbations in the receiver
front end, such as slow jitter in the sampler phase.
