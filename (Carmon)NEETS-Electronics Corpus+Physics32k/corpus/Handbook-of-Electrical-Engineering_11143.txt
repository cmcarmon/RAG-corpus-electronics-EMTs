In 1965, Johnson Space Center contracted with the University of Minnesota to explore the then-known
but little-developed concept of impedance cardiography (ICG) as a means of astronaut monitoring. A
ﬁve-year program led to the development of the Minnesota Impedance Cardiograph (MIC), an electronic
system for measuring impedance changes across the thorax that would be reﬂective of cardiac function
and blood ﬂow from the heart’s left ventricle into the aorta. ICG clearly had broad potential for hospital
applications but further development and reﬁnement was needed. A number of research institutions and
medical  equipment  companies  launched  development  of  their  own  ICGs,  using  MIC  technology  as  a
departure point. Among them were Renaissance Technologies, Inc., Newtown, Pennsylvania, and Drexel
University of Philadelphia, who jointly developed the IQ System. The system provides a simple, repeatable,
non-invasive way of assessing cardiac function at dramatically reduced cost. The IQ System is in wide
use in hospital intensive care units, emergency rooms, operating rooms, and laboratories in the U.S. and
abroad.
