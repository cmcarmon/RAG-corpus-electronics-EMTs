To avoid damaging heat‚Äêsensitive components (such as transistors), attach 
an alligator clip to the lead between the intended solder joint and the body 
of the component. This way, any excess heat will be drawn away through the 
clip and will not damage the component. Be sure to let the clip cool before 
you handle it again.
