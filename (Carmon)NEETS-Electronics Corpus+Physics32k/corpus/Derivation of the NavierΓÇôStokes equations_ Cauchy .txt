The generic density of the momentum source




s



{\displaystyle \mathbf {s} }
seen previously is made specific first by breaking it up into two new terms, one to describe surface forces and one for body forces, such as gravity. By examining the forces acting on a small cube in a fluid, it may be shown that

{\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}=\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {f} }

where




σ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}
is the Cauchy stress tensor, and




f



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} }
accounts for body forces present. This equation is called the Cauchy momentum equation and describes the non-relativistic momentum conservation of any continuum that conserves mass.




σ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}
is a rank two symmetric tensor given by its covariant components. In orthogonal coordinates in three dimensions it is represented as the 3x3 matrix:

{\displaystyle \sigma _{ij}={\begin{pmatrix}\sigma _{xx}&\tau _{xy}&\tau _{xz}\\\tau _{yx}&\sigma _{yy}&\tau _{yz}\\\tau _{zx}&\tau _{zy}&\sigma _{zz}\end{pmatrix}}}

where the



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
are normal stresses and



τ

shear stresses. This matrix is split up into two terms:

where



I


{\displaystyle I}
is the 3 x 3 identity matrix and




τ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
is the deviatoric stress tensor. Note that the mechanical pressure p is equal to minus the mean normal stress:

.


{\displaystyle p=-{\frac {1}{3}}\left(\sigma _{xx}+\sigma _{yy}+\sigma _{zz}\right).}

The motivation for doing this is that pressure is typically a variable of interest, and also this simplifies application to specific fluid families later on since the rightmost tensor




τ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
in the equation above must be zero for a fluid at rest. Note that




τ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
is traceless. The Cauchy equation may now be written in another more explicit form:




ρ

f



{\displaystyle \rho {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}=-\nabla p+\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\tau }}+\mathbf {f} }

This equation is still incomplete. For completion, one must make hypotheses on the forms of




τ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
and



p


{\displaystyle p}
, that is, one needs a constitutive law for the stress tensor which can be obtained for specific fluid families and on the pressure. Some of these hypotheses bring to Euler equations (fluid dynamics), other ones bring to Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, if the flow is assumed compressible an equation of state will be required, which will likely further require a conservation of energy formulation.
