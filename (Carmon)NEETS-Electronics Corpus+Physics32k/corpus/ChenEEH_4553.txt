Fault analysis is similar to system identiﬁcation in that the
system is reidentiﬁed to determine if the component input/
output relations have changed. It should be clear that connec-
tion information is essential to detection of a faulty compo-
nent. As before, note that fault analysis is not restricted to
linear systems. To illustrate some of the technique, the discus-
sion will focus on a linear time-invariant situation.
