Although OOP is an old technology (circa 1970), it began to gain widespread acceptance in the 1990s because
of the growing power of workstations, the increased use of graphical user interfaces, and the invention of hybrid
object-oriented languages such as C++. Typically, C++ adds 15â€“20% overhead to an application program due
to delayed binding of objects to their methods. Given that the power of the hardware increases more than 20%
per annum, this is an acceptable performance penalty. In addition, OOP is much more suitable for the design
of  graphical  user-interface-intensive  applications  because  the  display  objects  correspond  with  programming
objects, thus simplifying design and coding. Finally, if you know C, it is a small step to learn C++.
