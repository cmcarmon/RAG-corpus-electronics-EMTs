The below discussion is due to Landau. If the amplitude and the direction of propagation varies slowly over the distances of wavelength, then an arbitrary sound wave can be approximated locally as a plane wave. In this case, the velocity potential can be written as




ϕ

{\displaystyle \phi =\mathrm {e} ^{\mathrm {i} \psi }}

For plane wave

{\displaystyle \psi ={\boldsymbol {k}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {r}}-\omega t+\alpha }
, where




k



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {k}}}
is a constant wavenumber vector,



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is a constant frequency,




r



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {r}}}
is the radius vector,



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time and



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is some arbitrary complex constant. The function



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
is called the eikonal. We expect the eikonal to vary slowly with coordinates and time consistent with the approximation, then in that case, a Taylor series expansion provides

{\displaystyle \psi =\psi _{o}+{\boldsymbol {r}}\cdot {\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial {\boldsymbol {r}}}}+t{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial t}}.}

Equating the two terms for

, one finds

{\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=c^{2}k^{2}}
holds, where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of sound and



k


{\displaystyle k}
is the magnitude of the wavenumber vector. Therefore, the eikonal satisfies a first order nonlinear partial differential equation,

where



c


{\displaystyle c}
can be a function of coordinates if the fluid is not homogeneous. The above equation is same as Hamilton–Jacobi equation where the eikonal can be considered as the action. Since Hamilton–Jacobi equation is equivalent to Hamilton's equations, by analogy, one finds that
