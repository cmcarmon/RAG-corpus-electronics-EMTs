structure. The thyristor may be viewed as two bipolar transis-
tors connected back to back. The collector current of one
transistor provides base current to the other transistor. In the
reverse direction, the thyristor operates similarly to a reverse-
biased diode. When a forward polarity volage is applied, the
junction J3 (between the gate and drift region) is reverse
biased, and the thyristor is in the forward blocking mode.
The device can be triggered into latch-up by injecting a hole
current from the gate electrode. Considering ICO to be the
leakage current of each transistor in cut-off condition, the
anode current can be expressed in terms of gate current as:
