Advances in microprocessor technology pose new challenges
for supplying power to these devices. The evolution of micro-
processors began when the high-performance Pentium proces-
sor was driven by a nonstandard power supply of less than 5 V
instead of drawing its power from the 5-V plane on the
motherboard (Goodfellow and Weiss, 1997).
