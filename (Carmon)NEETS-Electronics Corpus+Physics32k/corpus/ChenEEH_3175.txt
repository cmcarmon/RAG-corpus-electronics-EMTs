Porcelain and glass are also dense materials. Hence, insula-
tors made from these materials are heavy. They possess a
compressive strength that is at least an order of magnitude
higher than the tensile strength. They are brittle materials, and
such insulators need to be handled with great care to avoid
breakages.
