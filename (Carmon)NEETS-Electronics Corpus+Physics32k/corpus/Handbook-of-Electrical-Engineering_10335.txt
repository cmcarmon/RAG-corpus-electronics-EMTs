The network management system standards community has deﬁned ﬁve functional areas as requirements for
network management systems. These areas are fault management, accounting management, conﬁguration man-
agement, performance management, and security management. The VSAT network management system should
be capable of interfacing with other network management systems by supporting a standard network management
protocol. The protocol standard most widely accepted is the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
