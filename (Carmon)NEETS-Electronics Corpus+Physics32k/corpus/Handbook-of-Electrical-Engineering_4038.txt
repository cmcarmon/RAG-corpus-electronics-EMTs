is the process of electrically establishing a low impedance path between two or more points in a
system. An ideal ground plane is a zero potential, zero impedance body that can be used as reference for all
signals  in  the  system. Associated  with  grounding  is 
,  which  is  the  establishment  of  a  low  impedance
path between two metal surfaces.
