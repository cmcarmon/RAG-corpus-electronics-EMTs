Hastatic order was first reported in January 2013 when the heavy-fermion uranium compound URu2Si2 was cooled to nearly −415 °F (−248.3 °C). It was said to produce extra heat and the heat was the main mystery. After the extra heat was released, particles were arranged at this way, making the hastatic order present on that reaction.
