A French invention used in sugar production to move the partially processed sugar liquid up a pipe to the next stage of purification. Hence the name “monte-jus” or “raise juice”. Unlike the acid egg, it traditionally consists of a vertical cylindrical vessel made of steel, with a pipe from the bottom turned upwards, and it is pressurized by steam.
