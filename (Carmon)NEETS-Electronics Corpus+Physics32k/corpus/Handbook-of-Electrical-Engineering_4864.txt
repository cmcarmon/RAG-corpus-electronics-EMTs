The increase of the piezoresistance properties of a commercial thick Ô¨Ålm resistor (ESL 2900 series) with sheet
resistivity is illustrated in Fig. 51.3. The experimentally observed properties such as the resistance increase and
decrease with tensile and compressive strains, respectively, and the increase of the elastoresistance tensor with
sheet resistivity seem to support a barrier tunneling model [Canali et al., 1980].
