There are many instances when you are very much concerned with the question of rotational or 
vibratory speeds. Knowledge of rotational speeds is necessary where the output of a direct current 
generator has fallen below a minimum desired output or where the speed of a motor (such as the motor in 
a teletypewriter or radar antenna) must be maintained at a constant value. There are many instruments that 
you can use for this purpose, such as tuning forks, stroboscopes, vibrating-reed meters, and 
electromechanical counters. The oscilloscope and the frequency counter are two of the other devices 
which may be used, but their use may require the employment of accessory equipment.
