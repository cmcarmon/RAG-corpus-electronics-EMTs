When an ac power source is used, the SCR is turned off automatically, since current and voltage 
drop to zero every half cycle. By using one SCR on positive alternations and one on negative, full-wave 
rectification can be accomplished, and control is obtained over the entire sine wave. The SCR serves in 
this application just as its name impliesâ€”as a controlled rectifier of ac voltage.
