cylindrical  conﬁguration  consists  of  one  revolute  and  two  linear
joints  (RPP),  so  that  the  robot  joints  correspond  to  a  cylindrical
coordinate system. The spherical conﬁguration consists of two rev-
olute joints and one linear joint (RRP), so that the robot moves in
a spherical, or polar, coordinate system. The articulated (arm-and-
elbow) conﬁguration consists of three revolute joints (RRR), giving
the robot a somewhat human-like range of motion. The SCARA
(Selectively Compliant Assembly Robot Arm) conﬁguration con-
sists of two revolute joints and one linear joint (RRP), arranged in
a different fashion than the spherical conﬁguration. It may also be
equipped  with  a  revolute  joint  on  the  ﬁnal  sliding  link.  The  gantry  conﬁguration  is  essentially  a  Cartesian
conﬁguration, with the robot mounted on an overhead track system. One can also mount other robot conﬁg-
urations on an overhead gantry system to give the robot an extended workspace, as well as free up valuable
factory ﬂoor space. The percentage usage of the ﬁrst ﬁve conﬁguration types is listed in Table 101.1. This table
does not include gantry robots, which are assumed to be included in the Cartesian category. Additionally, this
information is from 1988, and does not accurately represent current usage.
