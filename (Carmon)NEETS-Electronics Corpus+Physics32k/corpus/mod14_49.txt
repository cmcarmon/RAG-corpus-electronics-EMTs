In this chapter you will learn about number systems in general and about binary, octal, and
hexadecimal (which we will refer to as hex) number systems specifically. Methods for converting
numbers in the binary, octal, and hex systems to equivalent numbers in the decimal system (and vice
versa) will also be described. You will see that these number systems can be easily converted to the
electronic signals necessary for digital equipment.
