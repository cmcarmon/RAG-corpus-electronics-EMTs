Since exploring the search space for these transformations is
tedious and error-prone, we are developing a systematic
method for automating the global loop transformation step.
Some information is available in (Catthoor et al., 2000). This
work, however, will still be in a research stage at the publication
time of this book, and currently the step is applied manually.
