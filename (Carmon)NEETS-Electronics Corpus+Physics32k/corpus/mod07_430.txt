The simple capacitor filter is the most basic type of power supply filter. The application of the 
simple capacitor filter is very limited. It is sometimes used on extremely high-voltage, low-current power 
supplies for cathode-ray and similar electron tubes, which require very little load current from the supply. 
The capacitor filter is also used where the power-supply ripple frequency is not critical; this frequency 
can be relatively high. The capacitor (C1) shown in figure 4-15 is a simple filter connected across the 
output of the rectifier in parallel with the load.
