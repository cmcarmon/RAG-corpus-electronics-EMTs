The rate at which a wave of a given frequency is refracted by an ionized layer depends on the angle 
at which the wave enters the layer. Figure 2-17 shows three radio waves of the same frequency entering a 
layer at different angles. The angle at which wave A strikes the layer is too nearly vertical for the wave to 
be refracted to Earth. As the wave enters the layer, it is bent slightly but passes through the layer and is 
lost. When the wave is reduced to an angle that is less than vertical (wave B), it strikes the layer and is 
refracted back to Earth. The angle made by wave B is called the CRITICAL ANGLE for that particular 
frequency. Any wave that leaves the antenna at an angle greater than the critical angle will penetrate the 
ionospheric layer for that frequency and then be lost in space. Wave C strikes the ionosphere at the 
smallest angle at which the wave can be refracted and still return to Earth. At any smaller angle, the wave 
will be refracted but will not return to Earth.
