If Einstein’s photoelectric law is applied to a free molecule, the kinetic energy (




E

K




{\displaystyle E_{K}}
) of an emitted photoelectron is given by





E

K


=
h
ν
−
I



{\displaystyle E_{K}=h\nu -I\,}
,
where h is Planck’s constant, ν is the frequency of the ionizing light, and I is an ionization energy for the formation of a singly charged ion in either the ground state or an excited state. According to Koopmans' theorem, each such ionization energy may be identified with the energy of an occupied molecular orbital. The ground-state ion is formed by removal of an electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital, while excited ions are formed by removal of an electron from a lower occupied orbital.
