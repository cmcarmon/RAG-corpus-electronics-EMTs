Driveline windup is also known as "axle binding" or "driveline binding".
Mechanical components in the drivetrain of vehicles may bind and wear, which may occur when tires of varying sizes are used on one vehicle. It is a particular issue in 4WD cars with tires having varied tread patterns or brands.
Despite marked size, different brands often differ in actual size. Even if both front and rear are the same brand, and marked with the same size they may still differ in actual size.
A pull to the right or left when driving or braking could trigger windup caused by mismatched tire tread/sizes.
