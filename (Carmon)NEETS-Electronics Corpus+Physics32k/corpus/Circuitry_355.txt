One  method  of  determining  the  behaviour  of  an 
amplifier  stage  is  to  make  use  of  an  equivalent 
circuit.  Figure  7.20  shows  the  basic  equivalent 
circuit of an amplifier. The output circuit is reduced 
to 
(see  Chapter  3) 
comprising  a  voltage  generator  (Av Ã— Vin) and  a 
series input resistance, resistance (Rout). This simple 
model allows us to forget the complex circuitry that 
might exist within the amplifier box!
