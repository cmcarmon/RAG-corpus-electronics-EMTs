When the hexadecimal and octal number systems are used to represent bit patterns in binary, they are called
binary-coded hexadecimal (BCH) and binary-coded octal (BCO), respectively. These two number systems are
examples of binary-derived radices. Table 86.3 lists several selected examples showing the relationships between
BCH, BCO, binary, and decimal.
