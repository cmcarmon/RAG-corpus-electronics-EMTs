Path-Delay Testing
Path-delay testing is aimed at testing whether a given component/system operates at a speciﬁed performance
level that is often measured as the maximum system clock frequency. For example, the lower bound for the
maximum clock frequency which a microprocessor IC is speciﬁed that it can reach needs to be veriﬁed. However,
due to the very large number of different operations that a microprocessor can perform it is not practical to
verify correct behavior of such a component operating at maximum clock frequency for every possible single
operation or sequence of operations that it is designed to perform. On the other hand, it may be possible to
examine the structure of the design to discover its logic paths and verify that signals can be propagated along
