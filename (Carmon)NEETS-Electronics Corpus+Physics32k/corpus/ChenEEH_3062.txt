Figure 3.1 is a cross section of a two-winding transformer.
Figure 3.1 illustrates how both windings are linked with the
same magnetic circuit. A sinusoidal voltage is induced in
the windings by a sinusoidal variation of ﬂux E ¼ 4:44 acBfN ,
with ac as the area of the core in square meters, B as the peak
