In reality, it is too difficult to vary the resistance 
manually to compensate for voltage and current 
changes. It is more efficient to replace the variable re-
sistor with a transistor (Figure 36-23) connected so 
that the loadâ€™s current flows through it. By changing the 
current on the base of the transistor, the transistor can 
be biased to conduct more or less current.  Additional 
components are required to make the  circuit self- 
adjusting (Figure 36-24). These components allow the
