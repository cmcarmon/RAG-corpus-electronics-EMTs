Thus, at t = 0
+
we are left with the voltage Q/C across the capacitor. Observe
that the impulse has effectively established the initial conditions on the circuit.
This completes our intuitive analysis of the initial interval. vC during this
Next, we examine the final interval (t (cid:5) 0). Since its current is zero for
t > 0, we can again replace the current source with an open circuit. After a long
period of time, a DC situation exists, and the capacitor voltage will be zero.
The zero value for vC for t (cid:5) 0 is also sketched in Figure 10.39c.
