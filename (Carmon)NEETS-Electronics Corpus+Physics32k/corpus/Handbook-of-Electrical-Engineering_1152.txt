Finite Wordlength Effects in IIR Filters
Since  practical  digital  ﬁlters  must  be  implemented  with  limited-precision  arithmetic,  four  types  of  ﬁnite
wordlength effects result: (1) roundoff noise, (2) coefﬁcient quantization error, (3) overﬂow oscillations, and
(4) limit cycles. Round-off noise is that error in the ﬁlter output which results from rounding (or truncating)
calculations within the ﬁlter. This error appears as low-level noise at the ﬁlter output. Coefﬁcient quantization
error refers to the deviation of a practical ﬁlter’s frequency response from the ideal due to the ﬁlter’s coefﬁcients
being  represented  with  ﬁnite  precision.  The  term  overﬂow  oscillation,  sometimes  also  referred  to  as  adder
overﬂow  limit  cycle,  refers  to  a  high-level  oscillation  that  can  exist  in  an  otherwise  stable  ﬁlter  due  to  the
nonlinearity associated with the overﬂow of internal ﬁlter calculations. A limit cycle, sometimes referred to as
a multiplier round-off limit cycle, is a low-level oscillation that can exist in an otherwise stable ﬁlter as a result
of the nonlinearity associated with rounding (or truncating) internal ﬁlter calculations. Overﬂow oscillations
and limit cycles require recursion to exist and do not occur in nonrecursive FIR ﬁlters.
