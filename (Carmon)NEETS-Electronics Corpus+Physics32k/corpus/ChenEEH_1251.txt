‘‘Fault Tolerance in Computer Systems from
Circuits to Algorithms,’’ by Shantanu Dutt, Federico Rota,
and Franco Trovo, starts with a discussion on fundamental
issues in fault tolerance and dependability, then it further
treats a broad range of fault-detection and fault-tolerance
methods with potential applications to ﬁeld-programmable
gate arrays, program control-ﬂow, and processor systems.
The ubiquitous use of digital systems in all areas of human
endeavor and the decreasing feature sizes of VLSI/ULSI tech-
nologies make it important to incorporate fault tolerance
mechanisms into modern computer systems.
