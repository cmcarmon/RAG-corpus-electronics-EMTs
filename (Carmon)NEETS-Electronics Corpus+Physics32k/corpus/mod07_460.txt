Let's go a step further and redraw the filter circuit so that you can see the voltage divider action. 
Refer to view A of figure 4-24. Remember, the 165 volts peak 60 hertz provided by the rectifier consists 
of both an ac and a dc component. This first discussion will be about the ac component. From the figure, 
you see that the capacitor (C1) offers the least opposition (265 ohms) to the ac component. Therefore, the 
greater amount of ac will flow through C1. (The heavy line in view B indicates the ac current flow 
through the capacitor.) Thus the capacitor bypasses, or shunts, most of the ac around the load.
