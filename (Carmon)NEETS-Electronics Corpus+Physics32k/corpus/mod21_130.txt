When a prepunched card is fully inserted into the card switch (S101), a microswitch is actuated that
energizes a solenoid, causing the card switch contacts to complete the circuit. The card switch has 187
single-pole, single-throw switches arranged in 17 rows with 11 switches in each row. The card is used to
push the switches closed; thus, the absence of a hole in the card is required to actuate a switch.
