To determine vOUT in the operational amplifier as a function of vIN1 and vIN2, we again
assume that the two n-channel MOSFETs are identical, and that all three MOSFETs
operate in the saturation region. To distinguish the n-channel MOSFETs from the
p-channel MOSFET, denote the n-channel MOSFET parameters by Kn and VTn, and
the p-channel MOSFET parameters by Kp and VTp. Again, all parameters are positive
except for VTp.
