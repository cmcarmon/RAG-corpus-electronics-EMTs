For a network under steady-state operating conditions, power-ﬂow programs compute the
voltage magnitudes, phase angles, and transmission-line power ﬂows. Today’s computers are
capable of handling networks with more than 2000 buses (nodes) and 2500 transmission lines
in less than 1 minute power-ﬂow solutions. Interactive power-ﬂow programs have also been
developed along with CRT displays.
