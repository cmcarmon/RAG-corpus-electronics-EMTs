FIGURE  38.8 A  two-element  and  an  n-element  array  with  equal  spacing  between  elements.  The  propagation  length
difference between elements is d sinq,  which corresponds to a phase difference of kd sinq, where k is the wave number 2p/l.
The length L corresponds to a continuous aperture of length nd with the sample positions beginning  d/2 from the ends.
