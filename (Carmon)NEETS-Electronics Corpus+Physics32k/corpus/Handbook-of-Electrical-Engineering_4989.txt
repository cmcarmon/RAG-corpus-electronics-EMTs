As the voltage is increased across a dielectric material, a point is ultimately reached beyond which the insulation
will no longer be capable of sustaining any further rise in voltage and breakdown will ensue, causing a short
to develop between the electrodes. If the dielectric consists of a gas or liquid medium, the breakdown will be
self-healing  in  the  sense  that  the  gas  or  liquid  will  support  anew  a  reapplication  of  voltage  until  another
breakdown recurs. In a solid dielectric, however, the initial breakdown will result in a formation of a permanent
conductive channel, which cannot support a reapplication of voltage. The dielectric breakdown processes are
distinctly different for the three states of matter.
