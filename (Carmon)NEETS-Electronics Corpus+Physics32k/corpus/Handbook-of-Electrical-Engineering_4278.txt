to microphonism from vibrations), but most signiÔ¨Åcantly, by the spectrum of the transmitter, which inevitably
will  have  noise  sidebands  that  extend  much  higher  than  these  Doppler  frequencies,  probably  by  orders  of
magnitude. At higher microwave frequencies the Doppler frequencies are also higher and more widely spread.
In  addition,  the  spectra  of  higher  frequency  transmitters  are  also  wider,  and,  in  fact,  the  transmitter  noise-
sideband  problem  is  usually  worse  at  higher  frequencies,  particularly  at  millimeter  wavelengths  (i.e.,  above
30 GHz).  These  characteristics  may  necessitate  frequency  stabilization  or  phase  locking  of  transmitters  to
improve the spectra.
