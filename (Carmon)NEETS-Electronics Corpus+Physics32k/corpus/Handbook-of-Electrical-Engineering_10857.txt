Simulation Languages
For many years before the predominance of digital computers, dynamic system behavior was simulated using
analog and hybrid computers. 
 began to take over from analog and hybrid simulation during
the mid-1960s. Digital simulation programs can be used to model a wider range of nonlinear phenomena more
reliably than analog or hybrid computers, at the cost of losing real-time and introducing quantization problems.
However, the disadvantages of the technology are more than outweighed by improvements in modeling pos-
sibilities and increases in productivity. Digital simulation has superseded analog computation in all but a few
specialized areas.
