For example, in a reduced order model of a separately excited dc machine
that ignores the details of commutation action and only portrays the average
values of voltage, current, and power, the armature winding can be represented
as  an  equivalent  winding  whose  axis  is  determined  by  the  position  of  the
commutator  brushes.  The  induced  voltage  in  the  armature,  Ea,  due  to  ﬁeld
ωφ, ka being a machine constant; ω, the rotor speed;
ﬂux can be expressed as ka
and φ the ﬂux per pole. When armature reaction is ignored, φ will be the ﬂux
produced by the ﬁeld winding. (See Fig. 66.30).
