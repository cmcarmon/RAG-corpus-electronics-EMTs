According to the law of conservation of energy, no energy is destroyed due to friction, though it may be lost to the system of concern. Energy is transformed from other forms into thermal energy. A sliding hockey puck comes to rest because friction converts its kinetic energy into heat which raises the thermal energy of the puck and the ice surface. Since heat quickly dissipates, many early philosophers, including Aristotle, wrongly concluded that moving objects lose energy without a driving force.
When an object is pushed along a surface along a path C, the energy converted to heat is given by a line integral, in accordance with the definition of work

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {fric} }\,}
is the friction force,






F



n






{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {n} }\,}
is the vector obtained by multiplying the magnitude of the normal force by a unit vector pointing against the object's motion,





μ


k






{\displaystyle \mu _{\mathrm {k} }\,}
is the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is inside the integral because it may vary from location to location (e.g. if the material changes along the path),





x




{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \,}
is the position of the object.
Energy lost to a system as a result of friction is a classic example of thermodynamic irreversibility.
