Studying the attenuation coefficient and phase velocity, and compare them with Kolskys Q model we have plotted the result on fig.1. The data for the models are taken from Ursin and Toverud.
Data for the Kolsky model (blue):
cr = 2000 m/s, Qr = 100, wr = 2π100
Data for Kjartansson constant Q model (green):
a1 = 2.5 × 10 −6, γ = 0.0031
