Two of the goals for multiprocessor software development are
the same as those for single-processor systems: (1) the facilities
should support correct program development, and (2) the
application program should be portable to a wide variety of
systems. There is a third goal: performance. The performance
goal, however, should satisfy a further requirement of scalabil-
ityâ€”the speed of the system should increase preferably linearly
with the number of processors. This means that the computa-
tional load should be optimally distributed among the proces-
sors: the task of this optimal distribution is often known as
load balancing. While the multiprocessor system architecture
usually dictates its scalability, appropriate languages and com-
pilers ensure that the performance potential can be exploited
by application programs.
