Some of the disadvantages of this conﬁguration are that transistors must block twice the supply voltage,
ﬂux symmetry imbalance can cause transformer saturation and special control circuitry is required to
avoid  this  problem,  and  use  of  center-tap  transformer  requires  extra  copper  resulting  in  higher  volt-
ampere (VA) rating.
