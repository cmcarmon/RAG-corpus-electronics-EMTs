The performance of the overall communication system is illustrated in Fig. 78.12(d). The error probability
curve is perhaps the most important simulation product. Note that both uncoded and coded results are shown.
The  coded  results  were  calculated  analytically  from  the  uncoded  results  assuming  a  (63,  55)  Reedâ€“Solomon
code. It should be mentioned that semi-analytic simulation was used in this example since, as can be seen in
Fig. 78.10, the noise is injected into the system on the receiver side of the nonlinearity so that linear analysis
may be used to determine the effects of the noise on the system performance.
