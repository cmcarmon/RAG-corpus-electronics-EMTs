For the RHSs equal to zero there are non-trivial solutions: torque-free precession. Notice that if I is constant (because the inertia tensor is the 3×3 identity matrix, because we work in the intrinsic frame, or because the torque is driving the rotation around the same axis

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {n}} }
so that I is not changing) then we may write

{\displaystyle \mathbf {M} \ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ I{\frac {d\omega }{dt}}\mathbf {\hat {n}} =I\alpha \,\mathbf {\hat {n}} }

where
α is called the angular acceleration (or rotational acceleration) about the rotation axis

However, if I is not constant in the external reference frame (i.e. the body is moving and its inertia tensor is not the identity) then we cannot take the I outside the derivative. In this case we will have torque-free precession, in such a way that I(t) and ω(t) change together so that their derivative is zero. This motion can be visualized by Poinsot's construction.
