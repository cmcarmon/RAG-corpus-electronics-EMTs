The PEs in the MLP are composed of an adder followed by a smooth saturating nonlinearity of the sigmoid
type  (Fig. 20.3).  The  most  common  saturating  nonlinearities  are  the  logistic  function  and  the  hyperbolic
tangent.  The  threshold  is  used  in  other  nets.  The  importance  of  the  MLP  is  that  it  is  a  universal  mapper
(implements  arbitrary  input/output  maps)  when  the  topology  has  at  least  two  hidden  layers  and  sufÔ¨Åcient
number  of  PEs  [Haykin,  1994].  Even  MLPs  with  a  single  hidden  layer  are  able  to  approximate  continuous
input/output maps. This means that rarely we will need to choose topologies with more than two hidden layers.
But these are existence proofs, so the issue that we must solve as engineers is to choose how many layers and
how many PEs in each layer are required to produce good results.
