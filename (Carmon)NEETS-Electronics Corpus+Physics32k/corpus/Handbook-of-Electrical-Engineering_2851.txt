In the conduction process, heat is transferred from one element to another by direct physical contact between
the  elements.  Ideally  the  material  to  which  heat  is  being  transferred  should  not  be  adversely  affected  by  the

has little or no detrimental affect as long as the board temperature stays at least 50
material  exhibits  high  thermal  conductivity,  which  is  not  a  characteristic  of  ﬁberglass.  Therefore,  the  traces
must be depended on to provide the thermal transfer path [Choi et al., 1994]. Conductive heat transfer is also
used in the transfer of heat from IC packages to heat sinks, which also requires use of thermal grease to ﬁll all
air gaps between the package and the “ﬂat” surface of the sink.
