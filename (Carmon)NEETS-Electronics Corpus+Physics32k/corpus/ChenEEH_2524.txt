The nonuniform impedance transformer uses transmission
lines with gradually varying line geometry. The tapered imped-
ance transformer is a special case of nonuniform lines, and its
impedance changes smoothly and monotonically in the propa-
gation direction of the wave. This change of impedance is either
linear or exponential or follows rules derived from Chebyshev
or other designs. The synthesis of a tapered-line transformer is
usually made at its lowest frequency of interest over the pre-
designated bandwidth because the derivative of the reﬂection
coefﬁcient decreases rapidly with frequency. The nonuniform
line may be used not only for a broadband impedance trans-
former but also for other purposes, such as the realization of
low-pass and stop-band ﬁltering functions. Figure 7.12 presents
two typical layout examples of a tapered impedance transformer
and a nonuniform transmission line transformer.
