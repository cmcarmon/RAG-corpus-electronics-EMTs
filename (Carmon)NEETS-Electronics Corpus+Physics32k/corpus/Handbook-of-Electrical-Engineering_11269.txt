its third wire ground. For ECG machines the solution has typically been to AM modulate a medium-frequency
carrier signal (»400 kHz) and use an isolation transformer with subsequent demodulation. Other methods of
signal isolation can be used but the primary reason for the isolation is to keep the patient from being part of
the ac circuit in the case of a patient to power line fault. In addition, with many devices connected in a patient
monitoring situation it is possible that ground loop currents will be generated. To obviate this potential hazard
a low-impedance ground buss is often installed in these rooms and each device chassis will have an external
ground  wire  connected  to  the  buss. Another  unique  feature  of  these  ampliﬁers  is  that  they  must  be  able  to
withstand the high-energy discharge of a cardiac deﬁbrillator.
