The momentum of a system of particles is the sum of their momenta. If two particles have respective masses m1 and m2, and velocities v1 and v2, the total momentum is

.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}p&=p_{1}+p_{2}\\&=m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2}\,.\end{aligned}}}

The momenta of more than two particles can be added more generally with the following:




p
=

∑

i



m

v

.


{\displaystyle p=\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}.}

A system of particles has a center of mass, a point determined by the weighted sum of their positions:





r

{\displaystyle r_{\text{cm}}={\frac {m_{1}r_{1}+m_{2}r_{2}+\cdots }{m_{1}+m_{2}+\cdots }}={\frac {\sum \limits _{i}m_{i}r_{i}}{\sum \limits _{i}m_{i}}}.}

If all the particles are moving, the center of mass will generally be moving as well (unless the system is in pure rotation around it). If the center of mass is moving at velocity vcm, the momentum is:




p
=
m

v

cm


.


{\displaystyle p=mv_{\text{cm}}.}

This is known as Euler's first law.
