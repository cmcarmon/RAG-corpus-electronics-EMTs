Figure 4.14: The systems model for the vocal tract. The signals l (t), pT (t), and s (t) are the air
pressure provided by the lungs, the periodic pulse output provided by the vocal cords, and the speech
output respectively. Control signals from the brain are shown as entering the systems from the top.
Clearly, these come from the same source, but for modeling purposes we describe them separately since
they control diï¬€erent aspects of the speech signal.
