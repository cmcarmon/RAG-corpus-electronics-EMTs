1990 to 1997 showed that differential GPS could achieve an accuracy better than 1 m as a landing aid. Hence,
it is likely that a LAAS will replace or supplement ILS, which has been guaranteed to remain in service at least
until the year 2010 (Federal Radionavigation Plan). NATO may use MLS or a LAAS as a portable landing aid
for tactical airstrips.
