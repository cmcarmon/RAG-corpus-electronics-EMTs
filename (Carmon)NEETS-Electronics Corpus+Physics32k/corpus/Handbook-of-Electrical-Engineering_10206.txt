• Axial force capacity. Maximum designed axial force to function properly.
• Compressive stiffness. Should be high enough to withstand any press ﬁtting requirements.
• Lateral stiffness. Refers to force required to deﬂect RCC perpendicular to direction of insertion.
• Angular stiffness. Relates to forces that rotate the part about the compliant center (also called the cocking
