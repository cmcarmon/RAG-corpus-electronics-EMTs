The key idea of modulation is to aï¬€ect the amplitude, frequency or phase of what is known as the carrier
sinusoid. Frequency modulation (FM) and less frequently used phase modulation (PM) are not discussed
here; we focus on amplitude modulation (AM). The amplitude modulated message signal has the form
