The acronym stands for Semi- Implicit method for pressure-linked equations. It is essentially a guess and correct procedure for the calculation of the staggered grid pressure field. These have been illustrated using a two dimensional steady flow.

Step 1 :- A pressure field p* is guessed.
Step 2 :- The Discretized momentum equations are solved using the value of p* to get velocity components u* and v*.
Step 3:- Define the correction pressure as p' such that p = p* + p'
Step 4:- Similarly define the correction values for the velocities as u' and v' such that u = u* + u' and v = v*+ v'
Step 5:- Substitute the correct pressure field p in the momentum equations to obtain the correct velocity field (u,v).
Step 6 :- Subtract equations obtained in step 5 from those in step 1. We should get the equations in term of the correction terms (u′ and v′)
Here we apply an assumption that

{\displaystyle \sum a_{nb}u'_{nb}}
and



∑

′



{\displaystyle \sum a_{nb}v'_{nb}}
are 0 . This is the major assumption in the SIMPLE Algorithm. This should then allow us to obtain the correction terms u' and v' of the Momentum Equations.
We can similarly find the correction terms for all nodes.
Step 7 :- Solve the continuity equation for the entire control volume. i.e. n,s,e,w nodes surrounding each node of the staggered grid, using the density terms.
Step 8 :- Substitute the corrected velocity equations in the continuity equations and separate the term containing the correction pressure p'.
This represents the equation for pressure correction p'.
Step 9 :- Solve the thus obtained equation to get the correction term and get the correct pressure. Use the new correct pressure to reiterate the entire process till a convergence is obtained.
Sometimes, the solution might not converge due to a large difference in the guessed field and correct pressure field. The new p= p* + αp'. α is kept between 0 and 1 to ensure convergence.
The choice of α decides the cost effectiveness of the solution.
