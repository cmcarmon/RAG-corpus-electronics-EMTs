At the beginning of the first quarter-cycle (0ยบ  to 90ยบ) the voltage has just passed through zero and is 
increasing in the positive direction. Since the zero point is the steepest part of the sine wave, the voltage is 
changing at its greatest rate. The charge on a capacitor varies directly with the voltage, and therefore the 
charge on the capacitor is also changing at its greatest rate at the beginning of the first quarter-cycle. In 
other words, the greatest number of electrons are moving off one plate and onto the other plate. Thus the 
capacitor current is at its maximum value, as part (A) of the figure shows.
