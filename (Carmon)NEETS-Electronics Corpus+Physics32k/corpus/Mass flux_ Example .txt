Consider a pipe of flowing water. Suppose the pipe has a constant cross section and we consider a straight section of it (not at any bends/junctions), and the water is flowing steadily at a constant rate, under standard conditions. The area A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Suppose the pipe has radius r = 2 cm = 2 × 10−2 m. The area is then




A

{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}

To calculate the mass flux jm (magnitude), we also need the amount of mass of water transferred through the area and the time taken. Suppose a volume V = 1.5 L = 1.5 × 10−3 m3 passes through in time t = 2 s. Assuming the density of water is ρ = 1000 kg m−3, we have:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&\Delta m=\rho \Delta V\\&m_{2}-m_{1}=\rho (V_{2}-V_{1})\\&m=\rho V\\\end{aligned}}}

(since initial volume passing through the area was zero, final is V, so corresponding mass is m), so the mass flux is

{\displaystyle j_{m}={\frac {1000\times (1.5\times 10^{-3})}{\pi \times (2\times 10^{-2})^{2}\times 2}}={\frac {3}{16\pi }}\times 10^{4}}

which is approximately 596.8 kg s−1 m−2.
