PP1 axis. QQ1 represents the line of maximum propagation. You can see that radiation is stronger with an 
added element. The pattern in view B is sharper, or more directive, than that in view A. This means that 
the gain along the line of maximum energy propagation is increased and the beam width is decreased. As 
more elements are added, the effect is heightened, as shown in view C. Unimportant minor lobes are 
generated as more elements are added.
