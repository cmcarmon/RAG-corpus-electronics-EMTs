Spatial variation of the speed of light is implicitly present in general relativity, occurring in the coordinate space description.:

Based on this observation, variable speed of light models, including Dicke's, have been developed which agree with all known tests of general relativity, but some are distinct for higher-order tests.
Other models claim to shed light on the equivalence principle or make a link to Dirac's Large Numbers Hypothesis.
