The simplest case of rolling is that of an axially symmetrical object rolling without slip along a flat surface with its axis parallel to the surface (or equivalently: perpendicular to the surface normal).
The trajectory of any point is a trochoid; in particular, the trajectory of any point in the object axis is a line, while the trajectory of any point in the object rim is a cycloid.
The velocity of any point in the rolling object is given by




v

r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {\omega }}\times \mathbf {r} }
, where




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is the displacement between the particle and the rolling object's contact point (or line) with the surface, and




ω



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}}
is the angular velocity vector. Thus, despite that rolling is different from rotation around a fixed axis, the instantaneous velocity of all particles of the rolling object is the same as if it was rotating around an axis that passes through the point of contact with the same angular velocity.
Any point in the rolling object farther from the axis than the point of contact will temporarily move opposite to the direction of the overall motion when it is below the level of the rolling surface (for example, any point in the part of the flange of a train wheel that is below the rail).
