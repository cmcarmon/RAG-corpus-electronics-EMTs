Sometimes it is necessary to provide two signals that are equal in amplitude but 180ยบ out of phase 
with each other. (You will see one use of these two signals a little later in this chapter.) The two signals 
can be provided from a single input signal by the use of a PHASE SPLITTER. A phase splitter is a device 
that produces two signals that differ in phase from each other from a single input signal. Figure 1-26 is a 
block diagram of a phase splitter.
