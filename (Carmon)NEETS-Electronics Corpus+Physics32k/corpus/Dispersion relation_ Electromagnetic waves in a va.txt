For electromagnetic waves in vacuum, the angular frequency is proportional to the wavenumber:




ω
=
c
k
.



{\displaystyle \omega =ck.\,}

This is a linear dispersion relation. In this case, the phase velocity and the group velocity are the same:




v
=


ω
k


=



d
ω


d
k



=
c
;


{\displaystyle v={\frac {\omega }{k}}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}=c;}

they are given by c, the speed of light in vacuum, a frequency-independent constant.
