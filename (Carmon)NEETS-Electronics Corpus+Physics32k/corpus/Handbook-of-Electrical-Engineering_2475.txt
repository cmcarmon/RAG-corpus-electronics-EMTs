The  FET  source  follower  does,  however,  offer  substantial  advantages  over  the  emitter  follower  of  a  much
higher input resistance and a much lower input current. For the case in which a very high-impedance source,
up in the megohm range, is to be coupled to a low-impedance load down in the range of 100 W or less, a good
combination  to  consider  is  that  of  a  cascaded  FET  source  follower  followed  by  a  BJT  emitter  follower.  This
combination offers the very high input resistance of the source follower and the very low output resistance of
the emitter follower.
