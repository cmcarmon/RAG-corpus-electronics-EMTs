The angle of departure (arrival) of a root locus at a pole (zero) of  G(s)H(s) is determined by assigning a
point s1 to the root locus that is very close to the pole (zero) and applying the angle conditions of Eqs. (100.40)
or (100.41). Figure 100.24 illustrates the calculation of the angles of arrival and departure of the root locus at
the pole s = –1 + j. We assign a point s1 that is on the locus for K > 0 near the pole and draw phasors from all
the poles and the zero of G(s)H(s) to this point. The angles made by the phasors with respect to the real axis
must satisfy the angle condition in Eq. (100.46). Let the angle of the phasor drawn from –1 + j to s1 be designated
as q, which is the angle of departure; the angles drawn from the other poles and zero can be approximated by
regarding s1 as being very close to –1 + j. Thus, Eq. (100.46) leads to
