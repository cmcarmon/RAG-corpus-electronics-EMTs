 is similar in concept to the postal system. When a user wants to send a message to one
or more recipients, the user forms the message and addresses it. The message switching system reads the address
and forwards the complete message to the next switch in the path. The message moves asynchronously through
the  network  on  a  message  switch-to-message  switch  basis  until  it  reaches  its  destination.  Message  switching
systems  offer  services  such  as  mail  boxes,  multiple  destination  delivery,  automatic  veriÔ¨Åcation  of  message
delivery,  and  bulletin  board.  Communication  links  between  the  message  switches  may  be  established  using
circuit or packet switching networks as is the case with most other networking applications.
