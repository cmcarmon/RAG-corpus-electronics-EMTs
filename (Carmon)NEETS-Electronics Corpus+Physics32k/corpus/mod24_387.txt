Mechanical splices may also use either a grooved substrate or positioning rods to form suitable
V-grooves for mechanical splicing. The basic V-grooved device relies on an open grooved substrate to
perform fiber alignment. When inserting the fibers into the grooved substrate, the V-groove aligns the
cladding surface of each fiber end. A transparent adhesive makes the splice permanent by securing the
fiber ends to the grooved substrate. Figure 4-10 illustrates this type of open V-grooved splice.
