From Searle's formula, Walter Kaufmann (1901) and Abraham (1902) derived the formula for the electromagnetic mass of moving bodies:

{\displaystyle m_{L}={\frac {3}{4}}\cdot m_{em}\cdot {\frac {1}{\beta ^{2}}}\left[-{\frac {1}{\beta ^{2}}}\ln \left({\frac {1+\beta }{1-\beta }}\right)+{\frac {2}{1-\beta ^{2}}}\right]}

However, it was shown by Abraham (1902), that this value is only valid in the longitudinal direction ("longitudinal mass"), i.e., that the electromagnetic mass also depends on the direction of the moving bodies with respect to the aether. Thus Abraham also derived the "transverse mass":

{\displaystyle m_{T}={\frac {3}{4}}\cdot m_{em}\cdot {\frac {1}{\beta ^{2}}}\left[\left({\frac {1+\beta ^{2}}{2\beta }}\right)\ln \left({\frac {1+\beta }{1-\beta }}\right)-1\right]}

On the other hand, already in 1899 Lorentz assumed that the electrons undergo length contraction in the line of motion, which leads to results for the acceleration of moving electrons that differ from those given by Abraham. Lorentz obtained factors of




k

ε


{\displaystyle k^{3}\varepsilon }
parallel to the direction of motion and



k
ε


{\displaystyle k\varepsilon }
perpendicular to the direction of motion, where

{\displaystyle k={\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}
and



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
is an undetermined factor. Lorentz expanded his 1899 ideas in his famous 1904 paper, where he set the factor



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
to unity, thus:





m

{\displaystyle m_{L}={\frac {m_{em}}{\left({\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)^{3}}},\quad m_{T}={\frac {m_{em}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}
,
So, eventually Lorentz arrived at the same conclusion as Thomson in 1893: no body can reach the speed of light because the mass becomes infinitely large at this velocity.
Additionally, a third electron model was developed by Alfred Bucherer and Paul Langevin, in which the electron contracts in the line of motion, and expands perpendicular to it, so that the volume remains constant. This gives:
