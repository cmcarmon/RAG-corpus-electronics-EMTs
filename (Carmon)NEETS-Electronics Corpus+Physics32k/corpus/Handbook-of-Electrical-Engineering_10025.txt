which is a parabola for h Ô¨Ånite and the straight line x2 = x20 for h = 0, where x20 and x10 are the initial values
of x2 and x1. Similarly, more complex equations can be derived for other second-order transfer functions. Using
Eq. (100.143) with the appropriate values of h for the three regions in the phase plane, the step response for
an input of 4.6 units can be obtained as shown in Fig. 100.53.
