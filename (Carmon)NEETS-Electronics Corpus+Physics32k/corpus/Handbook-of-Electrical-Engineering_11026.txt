Buchtal et al. [1954] stated that the principal frequency components for the human EMG require a bandwidth
of 1 Hz to 10 kHz. It has been found that a time constant of about 50 ms is satisfactory, which corresponds to
a low-frequency â€“3-db point of 3 Hz. For needle electrodes with a tip diameter of 0.1 mm or larger, the input
impedance (one side to ground) should not be lower than that of a 500-kW resistor in parallel with less than
25-pF capacitance.
