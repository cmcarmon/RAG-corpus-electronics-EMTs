The term "cosine similarity" is sometimes used to refer to a different definition of similarity provided below. However the most common use of "cosine similarity" is as defined above and the similarity and distance metrics defined below are referred to as "angular similarity" and "angular distance" respectively. The normalized angle between the vectors is a formal distance metric and can be calculated from the similarity score defined above. This angular distance metric can then be used to compute a similarity function bounded between 0 and 1, inclusive.
When the vector elements may be positive or negative:





distance

=




cos

−
1


⁡
(

similarity

)

π




{\displaystyle {\text{distance}}={\frac {\cos ^{-1}({\text{similarity}})}{\pi }}}






similarity

=
1
−

distance



{\displaystyle {\text{similarity}}=1-{\text{distance}}}

Or, if the vector elements are always positive:





distance

=



2
⋅

cos

−
1


⁡
(

similarity

)

π




{\displaystyle {\text{distance}}={\frac {2\cdot \cos ^{-1}({\text{similarity}})}{\pi }}}






similarity

=
1
−

distance



{\displaystyle {\text{similarity}}=1-{\text{distance}}}

Although the term "cosine similarity" has been used for this angular distance, the term is used as the cosine of the angle only as a convenient mechanism for calculating the angle itself and is no part of the meaning. The advantage of the angular similarity coefficient is that, when used as a difference coefficient (by subtracting it from 1) the resulting function is a proper distance metric, which is not the case for the first meaning. However, for most uses this is not an important property. For any use where only the relative ordering of similarity or distance within a set of vectors is important, then which function is used is immaterial as the resulting order will be unaffected by the choice.
