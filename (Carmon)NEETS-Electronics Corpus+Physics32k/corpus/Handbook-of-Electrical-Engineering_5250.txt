The reactor core consists of fuel and control rods. Grids hold both the control and fuel rods. The fuel rods
are inserted in the grid following a predetermined pattern. The fuel elements are Zircaloy-clad rods ﬁlled with
UO
 pellets. The control rods are made of a silver (80%), cadmium (5%), and indium (15%) alloy protected
2
by stainless steel. The reactor operation is controlled by the position of the rods. In addition, control rods are
used to shut down the reactor. The rods are released and fall in the core when emergency shutdown is required.
Cooling water enters the reactor from the bottom, ﬂows through the core, and is heated by nuclear ﬁssion.
