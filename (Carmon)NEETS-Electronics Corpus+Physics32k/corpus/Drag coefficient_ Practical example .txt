The aerodynamic design of cars has evolved from the 1920s to the end of the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more streamlined body reduced the drag coefficient from about 0.95 to 0.30.

Time history of cars' aerodynamic drag in comparison to change in geometry of streamlined bodies (blunt to streamline).
