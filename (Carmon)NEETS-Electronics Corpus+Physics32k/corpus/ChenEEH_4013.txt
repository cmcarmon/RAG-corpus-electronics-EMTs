. A ﬁne-grained conﬁgurable cell performs simple logic
functions with more complex function (e.g., fast carry
look-ahead adder). A perfect example of this architecture
is the dynamically reconﬁgurable logic engine (DRLE)
(Nishitani, 1999). It is capable of real-time reconﬁgu-
ration with several
layers of conﬁguration tables. An
experimental chip is composed of a 4  12 array of
conﬁgurable cells. Each cell can realize two different
logic operations equivalent to 4-bit input to 1-bit output
or 3-bit input to 2-bit output. Up to eight different
conﬁgurations can be locally stored in each memory
cell. With 0.25-micron CMOS technology, the chip con-
tains 5.1 million transistors in a 10  10-mm2 die area
and consumes 500 mW at 70 MHz.
