In each of the five pictures in figure 1-11, there is an easily identified point from which to start
numbering. In the 4-prong and 6-prong tubes, the point is between the two larger prongs. In the octal tube,
the point is directly down from the keyway in the center of the tube. In the 7-pin and 9-pin miniatures, the
point is identified by the larger distance between pins.
