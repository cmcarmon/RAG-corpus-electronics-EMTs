The battery cables in our example would be large wires capable of carrying heavy currents. Most
wires used in electrical circuits are smaller and their current carrying capacity is limited. The size of wire
used in any given circuit is determined by space considerations, cost factors, and the amount of current
the wire is expected to carry under normal operating conditions. Any current flow greatly in excess of
normal, such as there would be in the case of a direct short, would cause a rapid generation of heat in the
wire.
