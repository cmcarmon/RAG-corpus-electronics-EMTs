Even though most modern communication systems have only been invented and developed during
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, it is difﬁcult to imagine a world without telephones, radio,
and television. After the invention of the electric battery by Alessandro Volta in 1799, Samuel
Morse developed the electric telegraph and demonstrated it in 1837. Morse devised the variable-
length binary code, in which letters of the English alphabet are represented by a sequence of
dots and dashes (code words). In this code, more frequently occurring letters are represented by
short code words, whereas letters occurring less frequently are represented by larger code words.
Morse code (variable-length binary code), developed in 1837, became the precursor to variable-
length source coding methods. Telegraphy, the earliest form of electrical communication, was a
binary digital communication system in which the letters of the English alphabet were efﬁciently
encoded into corresponding variable-length code words having binary elements. In the baudout
code, developed in 1875, the binary code elements were of equal length, and each letter was
encoded into ﬁxed-length binary code words of length 5.
