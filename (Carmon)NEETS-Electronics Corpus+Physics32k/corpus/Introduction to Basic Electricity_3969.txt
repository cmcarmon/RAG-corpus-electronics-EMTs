Figure 38-25 shows an op-amp connected as a 
noninverting amplifier. The output signal is in 
phase with the input. The input signal is applied to 
the op-ampâ€™s noninverting input. The output voltage 
is  divided between resistors R1 and R2 to produce a 
voltage that is fed back to the inverting (2) input. The 
voltage gain of a noninverting input amplifier is always 
greater than 1.
