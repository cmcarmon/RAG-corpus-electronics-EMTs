where f0 is the resonant  frequency (in Hertz), L is 
the inductance (in Henries) and C is the capacitance 
(in Farads). 
  Typical  impedance-frequency  characteristics  for 
series and parallel tuned circuits are shown in Figs 
4.17 and 4.18.  
  The  series  L–C–R  tuned  circuit  has  a  minimum 
impedance  at  resonance  (equal  to  R) and  thus 
maximum  current  will 
is 
consequently known as an acceptor circuit.
