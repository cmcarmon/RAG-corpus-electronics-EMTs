Your first mission — should you choose to accept it — is to build a circuit 
containing a single light‐emitting diode (LED) that blinks on and off at a rate 
that you can vary. This may sound simple (and, thanks to the 555 timer IC, 
it is), but getting the LED to blink means you must successfully build a com-
plete circuit, limit the current in your circuit so that it doesn’t fry your LED, 
and set up a timer to switch the current on and off so that the light blinks. 
After you accomplish your mission, you modify the circuit to create a multi‐
LED flasher that you can mount to the back of your bike to alert motorists to 
your presence.
