In QoS-based routing, paths for different trafﬁc ﬂows are
determined based on some knowledge of resource availability
in the network as well as the QoS requirement of the ﬂows. For
example, in Figure 7.5, suppose there is a trafﬁc ﬂow from host
X to host Y, which requires 4 Mbps bandwidth. Although path
A–B–C is shorter (with just two hops), it will not be selected
because it does not have enough bandwidth. Instead, path
A–E–D–C is
the bandwidth
requirement.
