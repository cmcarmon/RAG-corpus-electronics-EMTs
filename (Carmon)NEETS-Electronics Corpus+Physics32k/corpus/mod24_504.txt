The pulse delay for both a long test sample fiber and a short reference fiber are measured over a
range of wavelengths. The pulse delay for the reference fiber as a function of wavelength is t in( l ). The
pulse delay for the test fiber as a function of wavelength is t out( l ). The group delay t ( l ). per unit length at
each wavelength is
