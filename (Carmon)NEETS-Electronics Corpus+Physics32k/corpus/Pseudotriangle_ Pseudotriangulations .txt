A pseudotriangulation is a partition of a region of the plane into pseudotriangles. Any triangulation of a region of the plane is a pseudotriangulation. While any two triangulations of the same region must have the same numbers of edges and triangles, the same is not true of pseudotriangulations; for instance, if the region is itself an n-vertex polygonal pseudotriangle, then a pseudotriangulation of it may have as few as one pseudotriangle and n edges, or as many as n − 2 pseudotriangles and 2n − 3 edges.
A minimal pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation T such that no subgraph of T is a pseudotriangulation covering the same convex region of the plane. A minimal pseudotriangulation with n vertices must have at least 2n − 3 edges; if it has exactly 2n − 3 edges, it must be a pointed pseudotriangulation, but there exist minimal pseudotriangulations with 3n − O(1) edges.
Agarwal et al. (2002) describe data structures for maintaining pseudotriangulations of moving points or moving polygons. They show that using pseudotriangulations in place of triangulations allows their algorithms to maintain these structures with relatively few combinatorial changes as the inputs move, and they use these dynamic pseudotriangulations to perform collision detection among the moving objects.
Gudmundsson et al. (2004) consider the problem of finding a pseudotriangulation of a point set or polygon with minimum total edge length, and provide approximation algorithms for this problem.
