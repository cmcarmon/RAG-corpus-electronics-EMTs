Because of the high-frequency losses associated with rubber insulators, polyethylene plastic was
developed to replace rubber and eliminate these losses. Polyethylene plastic is a solid substance that
remains flexible over a wide range of temperatures. It is unaffected by seawater, gasoline, oil, and most
other liquids that may be found aboard ship. The use of polyethylene as an insulator results in greater
high-frequency losses than the use of air as an insulator. However, these losses are still lower than the
losses associated with most other solid dielectric materials.
