the zero flag is set when the result of an 
ALU operation is zero (i.e. a byte value 
of 00000000) 
the carry flag  is  set  whenever the result 
of  an  ALU  operation  (such  as  addition) 
generates  a  carry  bit  (in  other  words, 
when  the  result  cannot  be  contained 
within an 8-bit register)
