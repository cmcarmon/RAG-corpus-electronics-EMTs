• Isolate the grounds of low-level circuits from all other grounds.
• Where signal and power leads must cross, make the crossing so that the wires are perpendicular to each other.
• Use balanced differential circuitry to minimize the effects of ground circuit interference.
• For circuits whose maximum dimension is signiﬁcantly less than
