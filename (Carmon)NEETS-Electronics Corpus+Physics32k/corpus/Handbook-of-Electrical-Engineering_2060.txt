Summary and Acknowledgment
In this section, we have touched upon several topics in audio and electroacoustics. The reader may be reminded
that the author’s choice of these topics was biased by his background in communication acoustics (and by his
lack of knowledge in music). Furthermore, ongoing efforts in integrating different communication modalities
into  systems  for  teleconferencing  [see,  e.g.,  Flanagan  et al.,  1990]  had  a  profound  effect  in  focusing  this
contribution. Experts in topics covered in this contribution, like Jont Allen, David Berkley, Gary Elko, Joe Hall,
Jim  Johnston,  Mead  Killion,  Harry  Levitt,  Dennis  Morgan,  and—last,  but  not  least—Mohan  Sondhi,  are
gratefully acknowledged for their patience and help.
