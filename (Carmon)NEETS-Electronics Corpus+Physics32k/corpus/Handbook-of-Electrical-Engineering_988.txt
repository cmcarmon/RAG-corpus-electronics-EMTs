In Step 2 we use LD to ﬁt the slope of the linear region curve, holding U0 ﬁxed from step 1. We also ﬁt with
VT0 and THETA because without them the ﬁtting will not work. However, we want only the value of LD that
ﬁts the slope, so we throw away VT0 and THETA, replacing them with the values from step 1.
