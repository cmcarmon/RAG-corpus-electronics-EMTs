connector, and of the entire system. Loss measurements are figured by using the same methods you would
use for wire loss measurements. The OTDR injects a short, intense laser pulse into the fiber and monitors
reflections caused by breaks, inclusions, microcracks, and discontinuities. Discontinuities appear as a
spike on the OTDR display. The loss at the discontinuity point is directly related to the distance between
the major pulse triggered by the laser and the spike. The manufacturerâ€™s manual provides you with
conversion factors to figure actual losses and locations of the discontinuities.
