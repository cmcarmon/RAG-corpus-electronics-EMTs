An example application of a third-order VFS partial linear-
ization regulator design for the SDOF structure described
previously is simulated in equations 11.55 to 11.57, using the
simpliﬁed controller design derived above. Choosing the state
0
vector [x1 x2 x3]
, where z can be expressed as
previously noted, depending on the sign of s, the resulting
state-space description has the form y ¼ x1, and the following
results:
