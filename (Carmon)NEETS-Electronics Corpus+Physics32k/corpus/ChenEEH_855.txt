The type of data structure shown in Figure 4.3 is known as a
multigraph (West, 1996) since there may be more than one
edge between a pair of vertices in the graph. To simplify data
storage and the relevant analysis and optimization procedures,
this multigraph is reduced to a simple graph (West, 1996)
model by imposing the following restrictions:5
