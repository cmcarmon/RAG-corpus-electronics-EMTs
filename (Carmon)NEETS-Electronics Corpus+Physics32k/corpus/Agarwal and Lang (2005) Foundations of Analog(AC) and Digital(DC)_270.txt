The different interpretations of KVL are illustrated with the help of
Figure 2.15, which shows a loop containing N branches. Consider first the
loop in Figure 2.15 in which all branch voltages decrease in the clockwise direc-
tion. Since KVL states that the sum of the branch voltages around a loop is
zero, it follows for the loop in Figure 2.15 that
vn = 0.
