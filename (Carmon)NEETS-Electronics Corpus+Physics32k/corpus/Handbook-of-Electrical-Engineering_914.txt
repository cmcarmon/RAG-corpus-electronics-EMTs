Process and Device Simulation
Process and devices simulation are the steps that precede analog circuit simulation in the overall simulation
ﬂow (see Fig. 13.9). The simulators are also different in that they are not measurement driven as are analog
circuit simulators. The input to a process simulator is the sequence of process steps performed (times, temper-
atures, gas concentrations) as well as the mask dimensions. The output from the process simulator is a detailed
description of the solid-state device (doping proﬁles, oxide thickness, junction depths, etc.). The input to the
device  simulator  is  the  detailed  description  generated  by  the  process  simulator  (or  via  measurement).  The
output of the device simulator is the electrical characteristics of the device (IV curves, capacitances, switching
transient curves).
