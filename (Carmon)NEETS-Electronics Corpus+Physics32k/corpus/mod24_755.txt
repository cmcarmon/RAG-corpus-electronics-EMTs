The choice of an optical detector and the design of the preamplifier help determine the operational
characteristics of the receiver. Fiber optic receivers using APDs have greater sensitivity than those using
PIN photodiodes. In addition, trade-offs are made in preamplifier designs to increase sensitivity while
optimizing bandwidth and dynamic range. The two basic types of amplifiers used in fiber optic receivers
are the high-impedance amplifier and the transimpedance amplifier.
