An electrolytic capacitor has two primary disadvantages compared to a paper capacitor in that the
electrolytic type is POLARIZED and has a LOW LEAKAGE RESISTANCE. This means that should the
positive plate be accidentally connected to the negative terminal of the source, the thin oxide film dielectric
will dissolve and the capacitor will become a conductor (i.e., it will short). The polarity of the terminals is
normally marked on the case of the capacitor. Since an electrolytic capacitor is polarity sensitive, its use is
ordinarily restricted to a dc circuit or to a circuit where a small ac voltage is superimposed on a dc voltage.
Special electrolytic capacitors are available for certain ac applications, such as a motor starting capacitor.
Dry electrolytic capacitors vary in size from about 4 microfarads to several thousand microfarads and have a
working voltage of approximately 500 volts.
