form such as t = t(0) + k1 · C(out) + k2 · t(s), where t(0) is the intrinsic (internal) delay of the cell with no
loading, C(out) is the output capacitance seen by the output driver of the cell, t(s) is the rise/fall time of the
signal,  and  the  parameters  k1  and  k2  are  constants.  In  the  case  of  deep  submicron  CMOS  technologies,  the
overall delay must be divided into the intrinsic delay of the gate and the extrinsic delay of the interconnect,
each having substantially more-complex models than the linear model.
