Reactance-Tube Modulation.â€”In direct modulation, an oscillator is frequency modulated by a
REACTANCE TUBE that is in parallel (SHUNT) with the oscillator tank circuit. (The terms "shunt" or
"shunting" will be used in this module to mean the same as "parallel" or "to place in parallel with"
components.) This is illustrated in figure 2-11. The oscillator is a conventional Hartley circuit with the
reactance-tube circuit in parallel with the tank circuit of the oscillator tube. The reactance tube is an
ordinary pentode. It is made to act either capacitively or inductively; that is, its grid is excited with a
voltage which either leads or lags the oscillator voltage by 90 degrees.
