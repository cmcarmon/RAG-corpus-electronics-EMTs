The fuse is always installed after the switch on the 
“hot” (live and energized) lead of the AC power source. 
This disconnects the transformer from the AC power 
source when the fuse blows. By installing it after the 
switch, power can be removed from the fuse holder for 
added safety in replacing a blown fuse.
