Supporting Software
It  is  advisable  to  test  the  microprogram  before  its  actual  hard  implantation,  if  the  implantation  process  is
irreversible or too costly to repeat. Software simulators have been implemented to allow thorough testing of
the  newly  developed  microprogram.  Needless  to  say  these  tools  are  very  specialized  to  a  given  environment
and therefore costly to develop, as their development cost cannot be distributed over many applications.
