If we apply these same principles to simple circuits, such as the ones in figure 1-14, they affect input 
signals as shown. For example, in view (A) of the figure, a low frequency is blocked by the capacitor 
which acts as an open and at a high frequency the capacitor acts as a short. By studying the figure, it is 
easy to see how the various components will react in different configurations with a change in frequency.
