the distance (r) from the center of the fiber increases. The value of n1 decreases until it approaches the
value of the refractive index of the cladding (n2). The value of n1 must be higher than the value of n2 to
allow for proper mode propagation. Like the step-index fiber, the value of n2 is constant and has a slightly
lower value than the maximum value of n1. The relative refractive index difference ( D ) is determined
using the maximum value of n 1 and the value of n2.
