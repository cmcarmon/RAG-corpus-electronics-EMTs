A Practical Three-Winding Transformer Equivalent Circuit
The  circuit  of  Fig. 64.2(c)  is  reasonable  for  some  power  system  applications,  since  the  core  and  windings  of

, respectively, though of course not inﬁnite.
actual transformers are constructed of materials of high 
However,  for  other  studies,  discrepancies  between  the  performance  of  actual  and  ideal  transformers  are  too
great  to  be  overlooked.  The  circuit  of  Fig. 64.2(c)  may  be  modiﬁed  into  that  of  Fig. 64.3  to  account  for  the
most important discrepancies. Note:
