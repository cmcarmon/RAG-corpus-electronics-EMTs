13.2.23 A 2200-V, 1000-hp, three-phase, 60-Hz, 16-pole,
wye-connected, wound-rotor induction motor is
connected to a 2200-V, three-phase, 60-Hz bus
that is supplied by synchronous generators. The
per-phase equivalent circuit of Figure 13.2.6 has
the following parameters: R1 = 0.1  = R
(cid:7)
2,
Xl1 = 0.625  = X
l2, and Xm = 20 . If the
(cid:7)
machine is driven at a speed of 459 r/min to act as
a generator of real power, Ô¨Ånd the rotor current
referred to the stator and the real and reactive
power outputs of the induction machine.
