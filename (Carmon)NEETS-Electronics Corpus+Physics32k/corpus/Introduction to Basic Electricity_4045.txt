An integrated circuit that can be used as an astable 
multivibrator is the 555 timer (Figure 39-17). This 
 integrated circuit can perform many functions. It con-
sists of two comparators, a flip-flop, an output stage, 
and a discharge transistor. Figure 39-18 shows a sche-
matic diagram in which the 555 timer is used as an 
astable multivibrator. The output frequency is deter-
mined by resistors RA and RB and capacitor C1. This 
circuit finds wide application in industry.
