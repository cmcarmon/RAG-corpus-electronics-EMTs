Competition  is  a  very  efÔ¨Åcient  way  to  divide  the  computing  resources  of  a  network.  Instead  of  having  each
output PE more or less sensitive to the full input space, as in the associative memories, in a competitive network
each PE specializes into a piece of the input space and represents it [Haykin, 1994]. Competitive networks are
linear, single-layer nets (Fig. 20.17). Their functionality is directly related to the competitive learning rule, which
belongs to the unsupervised category. First, only the PE that has the largest output gets its weights updated.
The  weights  of  the  winning  PE  are  updated  according  to  the  formula  in  Fig. 20.17  in  such  a  way  that  they
approach the present input. The step size exactly controls how much is this adjustment (see Fig. 20.17).
