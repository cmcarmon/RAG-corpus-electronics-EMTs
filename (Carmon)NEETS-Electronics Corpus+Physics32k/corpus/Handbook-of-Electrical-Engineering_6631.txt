The payload type ﬁeld in the cell header differentiates the information in the cell payload of one connection
(e.g., user information, operation and maintenance information for ATM). The value of the cell loss priority
bit distinguishes cells that can be discarded under some exceptional network conditions without disturbing the
quality signiﬁcantly from those cells that may not be discarded. The last ﬁeld of the cell header forms the header
error control ﬁeld. The cell header is protected against errors with a mechanism that allows the correction of
a single bit error and the detection of multibit errors.
