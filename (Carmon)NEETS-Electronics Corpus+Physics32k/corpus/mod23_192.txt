This is probably the simplest tape transport configuration. Figure 4-9 shows how the magnetic tape 
is pulled off of the supply reel, taken across the magnetic heads, and wound onto the take-up reel. The 
tape is pulled by sandwiching it between a single capstan and a pinch roller. As the capstan turns, the 
friction between it and the pinch roller pulls the tape across the magnetic heads. The magnetic tape is held 
against the magnetic heads by using tape guides.
