The hydraulic jump in your sink
Figure 2 above illustrates a daily example of a hydraulic jump can be seen in the sink. Around the place where the tap water hits the sink, you will see a smooth-looking flow pattern. A little further away, you will see a sudden "jump" in the water level. This is a hydraulic jump.
The nature of this jump differs from those previously discussed in the following ways:
The water is flowing radially. As a result, it continuously grows shallower and slows due to friction (the Froude number drops) up to the point where the jump occurs.
The flow depth is thin enough that the surface tension can no longer be neglected, changing the wave solution conclusions. The higher speed of the surface tension waves bleed off the high frequency component, making an undular jump the dominant form.
Changes in the behavior of the jump can be observed by changing the flow rate.
