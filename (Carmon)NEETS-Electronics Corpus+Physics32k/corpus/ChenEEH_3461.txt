This type of operating characteristic will recognize that the
current difference is caused by an event that is not an internal
fault, and it will block the relay from operating. The criterion
for recognizing a nonfault event is the presence of a particular
harmonic content in the differential current. This knowledge is
used to restrain the relay operation by relating the factor k to
the presence of the harmonic content, hence the ‘‘harmonic
restraint’’ terminology.
