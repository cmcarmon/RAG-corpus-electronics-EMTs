Smart Electromagnetic Materials
Smart Magnetic Shielding Materials
As warranted by the surroundings, the self-adaptive shielding effectiveness to magnetic ﬁelds at low frequencies
(power frequencies such as 60 or 50 Hz) can be achieved by means of an integrated set of magnetic ﬁeld sensors
and actuators (magnetic biasing, current elements, etc.) plus a control system arrangement [Neelakanta and
Subramaniam, 1992].
High-Frequency Smart Shielding Materials
Corresponding  to  radio  and  higher  frequency  environments,  the  shielding  requirement  warrants  curtailing
both electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Hence, the relevant self-adaptive intelligent shielding system would consist
of an array of distributed electromagnetic sensors with appropriate elements (actuators) and a control system.
Smart Radar-Absorbing Materials
Absorption of microwave/millimeter wave energy at radar frequency is useful in radar stealth applications. Adap-
tively controllable smart radar-absorbing materials (smart RAMs) can be synthesized with integrated distribution
 
of electromagnetic detectors (sensors) with appropriate actuators and control system [Neelakanta et al.,
Smart Optical Surface Materials
Smart optical surface materials can be envisioned as those in which the surface optical properties (hue, intensity,
etc.) can be adaptively controlled by means of an intelligent sensor/actuator combinational control system.
