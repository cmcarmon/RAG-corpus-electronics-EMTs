allows you to adjust the resistance from virtually zero ohms to a factory‐
determined maximum value. You use a potentiometer when you want to 
vary the amount of current or voltage you’re supplying to part of your 
circuit. A few examples of where you might find potentiometers are 
light‐dimmer switches, volume controls for audio systems, and position 
sensors, although digital controls have largely replaced potentiometers 
in consumer electronics.
