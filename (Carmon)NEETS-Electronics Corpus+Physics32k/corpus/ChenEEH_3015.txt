is a certain width. Slot width should reach at least one-half a
wavelength for efﬁcient radiation to occur. Therefore, max-
imum and minimum widths roughly determine the bandwidth
of the structure. TSAs are usually built on thin, low-permittiv-
ity substrates if they are to achieve good radiation patterns and
maintain good radiation efﬁciency that will be reduced by TM0
surface wave losses. More about the tapered slot antenna may
be found in Yngvesson et al. (1985, 1989).
