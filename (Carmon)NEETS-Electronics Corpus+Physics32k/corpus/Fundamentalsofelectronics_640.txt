What is the value of y (−1)? Because we have used an input that is zero for all negative indices, it
is reasonable to assume that the output is also zero. Certainly, the diﬀerence equation would not
describe a linear system if the input that is zero for all time did not produce a zero output. With
this assumption, y (−1) = 0, leaving y (0) = b. For n > 0, the input unit-sample is zero, which
leaves us with the diﬀerence equation y (n) = ay (n − 1) , n > 0. We can envision how the ﬁlter
responds to this input by making a table.
