below 2 V as a logical 0. Further, suppose that senders are restricted to sending
voltages lower than 0.5 V for a logical 0. Then, it takes at least 1.5 V of (positive)
noise to force the senderâ€™s voltage signal on the wire into the forbidden region.
We say that such a choice of voltage levels offers a noise immunity of 1.5 V for
a logical 0.2
