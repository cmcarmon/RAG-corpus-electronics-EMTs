Hiemenz formulated the problem and calculated the solution numerically in 1911 and subsequently by Leslie Howarth(1934). The flow in the neighborhood of the stagnation point can be modeled by a flow towards an infinite flat plate, even though the whole body is a curved one(locally curvature effects are negligible). Let the plate be in the



x

{\displaystyle xz}
plane with



(
x
,
y
)
=

{\displaystyle (x,y)=(0,0)}
representing the stagnation point. The inviscid stream function

and velocity

{\displaystyle (u,v)}

{\displaystyle \psi =kxy,\quad u=kx,\quad v=-ky}

where

{\displaystyle k}

is a boundary layer thickness but it is constant(vorticity generated at the solid surface is prevented diffusing far away by an opposing convection, similar profiles are Blasius boundary layer with suction, Von Kármán swirling flow etc.,). Then the velocity components and subsequently pressure and the equation for
