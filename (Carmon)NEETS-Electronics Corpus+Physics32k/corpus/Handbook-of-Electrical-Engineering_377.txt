The instantaneous power delivered by each of the sources has the form given in Eq. (3.14), consisting of a
constant  term  representing  the  average  power  and  a  double-frequency  sinusoidal  term.  The  latter,  being
sinusoidal, can be represented by a phasor also. The only caution is that a different frequency is involved here,
so  this  power  phasor  should  not  be  mixed  with  the  voltage  and  current  phasors  in  the  same  diagram  or
calculations. Let *S* = *V**I* be the apparent power delivered by each of the three sources and let the three power
phasors be Sa, Sb, and Sc, respectively. Then:
