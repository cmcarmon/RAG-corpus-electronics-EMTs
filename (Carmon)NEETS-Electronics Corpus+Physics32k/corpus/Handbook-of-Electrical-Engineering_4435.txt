Various  techniques  are  used  to  realize  small  signal  or  low-power  broadband  ampliﬁers.  Five  of  them  are
shown  in  Fig.  43.3.  The  distributed  approach  provides  the  unique  capability  of  excellent  gain-bandwidth
, and moderately low noise ﬁgure. This technique has been
product, low 
successfully used in monolithic ultrabroadband ampliﬁers. The performance of such ampliﬁers using various
transistor devices is given in Table 43.1.
