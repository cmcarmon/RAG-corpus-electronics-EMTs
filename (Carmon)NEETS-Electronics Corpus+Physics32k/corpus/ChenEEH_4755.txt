Other approaches to this problem can be found in Joshi et
al. (1998), Singh et al. (1995), Luo and Lan (1993), and Krstic´
et al. (1995), among others. In Singh et al. (1995), the authors
present conventional adaptive and neural adaptive control
methods for wing rock control. In Luo and Lan (1993), an
optimal feedback control using Beecham-Titchener’s averaging
technique is applied. They present a single-neuron controller
trained with backpropagation to regulate wing rock, and this
controller is tested in a wind tunnel. In Krstic´ et al. (1995) the
authors use the tuning functions method of adaptive back-
stepping to develop a wing rock regulator.
