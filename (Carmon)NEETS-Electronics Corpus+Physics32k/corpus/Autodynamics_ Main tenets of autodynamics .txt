The primary claim of autodynamics is that the equations of the Lorentz transformation are incorrectly formulated to describe relativistic effects, which would invalidate special relativity, general relativity, and Maxwell's equations. The effect of the revised equations proposed in autodynamics is to cause particle mass to decrease with particle velocity, being exchanged with kinetic energy (with mass being zero and kinetic energy being equal to the rest mass at c). This exchange between mass and energy is the proposed mechanism underlying most of the derived conclusions of autodynamics.
Ancillary predictions of autodynamics include:
the nonexistence of the neutrino,
the existence of additional particles that have not been observed by mainstream physicists (including the "picograviton" and the "electromuon"),
the existence of additional decay modes for muons and interaction modes for energetic atomic nuclei.
