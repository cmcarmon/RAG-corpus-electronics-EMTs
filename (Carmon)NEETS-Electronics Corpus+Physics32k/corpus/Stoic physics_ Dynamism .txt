Materialism was also a doctrine of the Epicureans. The characteristic difference with the Stoic system was the idea of tension as the essential attribute of body. The Epicureans placed the form and movement of matter in the chance movements of primitive atoms. To the Stoics, however, nothing passes unexplained; there is a reason (Logos) for everything in nature. In everything that exists there are two principles, the active and the passive: everything which exists is capable of acting and being acted upon. By the passive principle a thing is susceptible to motion and modification; matter determines substance (ousia). The active principle characterizes matter, and gives it its quality. For all that happens there is a cause, and as only body can act on body, this cause is as corporeal as the matter upon which it acts. The active principle or "force" is everywhere coextensive with "matter," pervading and permeating it, and, together with it, occupying and filling space. A thing is no longer, as Plato once thought, hot or hard or bright by partaking in abstract heat or hardness or brightness, but by containing within its own substance the material of these qualities, conceived as air-currents (pneuma) in various degrees of tension. The virtues are corporeal, as indeed are actions. The Stoic quality corresponds to Aristotle's essential form; in both systems the active principle, "the cause of all that matter becomes," is that which accounts for the existence of a given concrete thing, but in the Stoic system, the principle is itself material. Here, too, the reason of things – that which accounts for them – is no longer some external end to which they are tending; it is something acting within them, "a spirit deeply interfused," germinating and developing from within. By its prompting a thing grows, develops and decays, while this "seminal reason," the element of quality in the thing, remains constant through all its changes.
