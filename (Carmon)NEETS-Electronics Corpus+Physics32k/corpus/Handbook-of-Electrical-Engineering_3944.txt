The  most  up-to-date  information  for  developments  in  the  ﬁeld  of  microstrip  antennas  can  be  found  in  the
technical journals. These include the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, the IEE Proceedings, Part
H,  and  Electronics  Letters.  There  are  also  a  large  number  of  symposiums  and  conferences  on  antennas  that
usually  emphasize  practical  microstrip  antenna  technology,  such  as  the  IEEE  International  Symposium  on
Antennas and Propagation, the International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation (ISAP–Japan), and the
International Conference on Antennas and Propagation (ICAP–Great Britain). Coverage of basic antenna theory
and design can be found in the previous sections in this chapter, as well as the references listed there.
