. Assured forwarding (AF) PHB: AF PHB divides incom-
ing trafÔ¨Åc into four classes; each AF class is guaranteed
some minimum bandwidth and buffer space. In each AF
class, packets are further assigned one of three drop
priorities. By varying the amount of resources allocated
to each AF class, different levels of performance can be
offered.
