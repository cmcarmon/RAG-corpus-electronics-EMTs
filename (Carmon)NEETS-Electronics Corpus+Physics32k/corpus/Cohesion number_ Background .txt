In simulation of granular materials, scaling the particle size with regards to the other particles physical and mechanical properties is a challenging job. Especially in simulation of cohesive powders, lack of a robust criterion for tuning the level of the surface energy of the particles can waste enormous amount of time during the process of calibration. The Bond number  has been used traditionally in this regards, where the significance of the adhesive force (pull-off force) is compared with the particles gravitational force (weight); nevertheless, the influence of the materials properties, particularly the particles stiffness, is not comprehensively observed in this number. The particles stiffness, which is not present in the Bond number, has a considerable impact on how particles respond to an applied force. If the forces in the Bond number are substituted with potential and cohesion energies, a new dimensionless number will be formed whereby the effect of the particles stiffness is also considered. This was firstly proposed by Behjani et al.  where they introduced a dimensionless number titled as the Cohesion number.
