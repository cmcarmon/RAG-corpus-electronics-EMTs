Increasing the frequency will also decrease the opposition offered by a capacitor. This occurs 
because the number of electrons which the capacitor is capable of handling at a given voltage will change 
plates more often. As a result, more electrons will pass a given point in a given time (greater current 
flow). The opposition which a capacitor offers to ac is therefore inversely proportional to frequency and 
to capacitance. This opposition is called CAPACITIVE REACTANCE. You may say that capacitive 
reactance decreases with increasing frequency or, for a given frequency, the capacitive reactance 
decreases with increasing capacitance. The symbol for capacitive reactance is XC.
