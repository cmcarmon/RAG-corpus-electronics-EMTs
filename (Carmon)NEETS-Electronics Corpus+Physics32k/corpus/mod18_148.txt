of these rf waves is continually increasing and decreasing from a fixed reference frequency. At any
instant, the frequency of the returned signal differs from the frequency of the radiated signal. The amount
of the difference frequency is determined by the time it took the signal to travel the distance from the
transmitter to the object.
