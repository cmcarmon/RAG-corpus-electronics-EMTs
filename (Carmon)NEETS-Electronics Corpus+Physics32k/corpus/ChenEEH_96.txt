This section next identiﬁes a special class of circuits of a
connected graph G. Again let T be a spanning tree of G. Because
exactly one path exists between any two vertices of T, adding a
chord c to T produces a unique circuit. This circuit is called the
fundamental circuit of G with respect to chord c of T. Note again
that the fundamental circuit with respect to chord c contains c,
and that the chord c is not present in any other fundamental
circuit with respect to T. As an example, the set of fundamental
circuits with respect to the spanning tree T ¼ (e1, e2, e6, e8) of
the graph shown in Figure 2.5. is the following:
