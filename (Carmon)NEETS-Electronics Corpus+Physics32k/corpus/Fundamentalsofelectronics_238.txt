Have we really solved the circuit with the node method? Along the way, we have used KVL, KCL, and
the v-i relations. Previously, we indicated that the set of equations resulting from applying these laws is
necessary and suﬃcient. This result guarantees that the node method can be used to “solve” any circuit.
One fallout of this result is that we must be able to ﬁnd any circuit variable given the node voltages and
sources. All circuit variables can be found using the v-i relations and voltage divider. For example, the
current through R3 equals e2
