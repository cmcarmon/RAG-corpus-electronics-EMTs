Single acting cylinders are economical and the simplest design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port at one end of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod.
Double acting cylinders have a port at each end or side of the piston, supplied with hydraulic fluid for both the retraction and extension.
