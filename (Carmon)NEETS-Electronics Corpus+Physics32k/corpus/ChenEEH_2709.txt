3. As illustrated in Figure 9.2, the Yee algorithm also
centers its ~EE and ~HH components in time in what is
termed a leapfrog arrangement. All of the ~EE computa-
tions in the modeled space are completed and stored in
memory for a particular time point using previously
stored ~HH data. Then, all of the ~HH computations in the
space are completed and stored in memory using the ~EE
data just computed. The cycle begins again with the
recomputation of the ~EE components based on the
newly obtained ~HH. This process continues until time-
stepping is concluded.
