Fire-control radar must be directed to the general location of the desired target because of the
narrow-beam pattern. This is called the DESIGNATION phase of equipment operation. Once in the
general vicinity of the target, the radar system switches to the ACQUISITION phase of operation. During
acquisition, the radar system searches a small volume of space in a prearranged pattern until the target is
located. When the target is located, the radar system enters the TRACK phase of operation. Using one of
several possible scanning techniques, the radar system automatically follows all target motions. The radar
system is said to be locked on to the target during the track phase. The three sequential phases of
operation are often referred to as MODES and are common to the target-processing sequence of most fire-
control radars.
