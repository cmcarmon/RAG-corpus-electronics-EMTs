(b) Let a negative feedback loop be added such
that vd = vin − Bvout. For values of B = 0.03
and 0.08, investigate how the negative feed-
back reduces nonlinear distortion, but reduces
gain.
*8.5.5 (a) Consider the voltage ampliﬁer with negative
feedback shown in Figure 8.5.3. For A =
−100, ﬁnd the feedback factor B in order to
get Af = −20.
