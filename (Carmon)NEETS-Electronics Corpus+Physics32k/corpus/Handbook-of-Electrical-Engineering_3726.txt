There  is  a  limit,  however,  to  how  small  particles  may  be  made  and  still  remain  stable. When  the  thermal
energy kT is comparable in magnitude to the energy required to switch a particle, M Â· Hc, the particle becomes
unstable and may switch because of thermal excitation. This phenomenon is known as superparamagnetism
and can lead to decay of recorded magnetization patterns over time.
