where VSIN is the name of the source, NODE-
PLUS is the number identifying the positive node,
NODEMINUS is the number identifying the nega-
tive node, VDC is the dc offset, VPEAK is the peak
value of the ac component, FREQ is the frequency
in hertz, TD is the time delay in seconds, DF is a
damping factor, and PHASE is the phase angle in
degrees. The voltage generated is then given by
v(t ) = VDC + VPEAK sin[PHASE],
