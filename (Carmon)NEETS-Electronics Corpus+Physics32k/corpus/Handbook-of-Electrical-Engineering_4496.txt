Modeling as a Transfer Function
The foregoing relationship may be viewed as a gener-
alized  transfer  function  (see  Fig. 45.1)  in  which  two
basic problem types become apparent. For the anal-
ysis or the direct problem, the input is known and the
transfer function is derivable from the problem spec-
iﬁcation,  with  the  output  or  response  to  be  deter-
mined.  For  the  case  of  the  synthesis  or  inverse
problem, two problem classes may be identiﬁed. The
easier  synthesis  problem  involves  ﬁnding  the  input,
given  the  output  and  transfer  function,  an  example
of  which  is  that  of  determining  the  source  voltages
that  produce  an  observed  pattern  for  a  known
antenna  array.  The  more  difﬁcult  synthesis  problem
itself separates into two problems. One is that of ﬁnding the transfer function, given the input and output, an
example of which is that of ﬁnding a source distribution that produces a given far ﬁeld. The other and still
more difﬁcult is that of ﬁnding the object geometry that produces an observed scattered ﬁeld from a known
exciting  ﬁeld.  The  latter  problem  is  the  most  difﬁcult  of  the  three  synthesis  problems  to  solve  because  it  is
intrinsically transcendental and nonlinear.
