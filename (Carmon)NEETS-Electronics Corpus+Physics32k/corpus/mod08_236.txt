In most cases, the capacitance is changed by the use of variable capacitors. The capacitors in the
input and output portions of all the rf amplifier stages are ganged together in order that they can all be
changed at one time with a single device, such as the tuning dial on a radio. (This technique will be shown
on a schematic a little later in this chapter.)
