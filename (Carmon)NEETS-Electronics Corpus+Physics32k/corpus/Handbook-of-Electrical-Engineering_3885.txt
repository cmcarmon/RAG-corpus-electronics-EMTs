It  is  convenient  to  assume  a  straight-line  ï¬‚ight  path  along  the  x-axis,  a  planar  earth  (x,  y  plane),  and  a
constant  velocity,  v,  with  range  and  cross-range  components  vr(x)  and  vc( x),  respectively.  In  many  radar
applications the broad side distance to the center of the footprint, R, is much larger than the size of the footprint.
This allows the distance R(x) to be expanded about R resulting in
