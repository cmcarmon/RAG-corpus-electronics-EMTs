The integration of the VRM with the processor can take
either a hybrid or a monolithic approach. In the hybrid ap-
proach, the VRM can be made as a silicon chip with all the
control functions. Figure 1.39 shows an integration-packaging
example. As shown in Figure 1.39(A) and (B), several VRM
chips can be placed in parallel and be mounted close to the
microprocessor on the same cartridge. Ceramic capacitors
with small ESRs and ESLs can be used as the output capacitors
and can be placed on the PCB board next to the processor. By
connecting the output of the VRM and the power input of
the processor via a path through a magnetic material sheet,
the small output inductor can also be created. With this
kind of packaging approach, interconnection parasitics can
be minimized. For future applications, some other advanced
packaging technologies, such as ï¬‚ip-chip technology, can also
be used.
