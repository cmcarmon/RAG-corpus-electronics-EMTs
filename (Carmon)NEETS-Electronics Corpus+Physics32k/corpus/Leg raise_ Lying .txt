The lying leg raise is done by lying on the floor on the back. It is done without apparatus except possibly cushions or weights for added resistance.
Practitioners generally caution to keep the lower back in contact with the floor and place hands to sides or under lower back for support.
Due to leverage, the hardest portion of a supine (lying) leg raise is generally the first part when the legs are on the floor, as this is when the femur is parallel with the earth and perpendicular to the pull of gravity.
