The rotor is then traveling at a speed of n1 − n or n1S r/min in the backward direction with
respect to the stator ﬁeld. The relative motion of the ﬂux and rotor conductors induces voltages
of frequency Sfs, known as the slip frequency, in the rotor winding. Thus, the induction machine
is similar to a transformer in its electrical behavior but with an additional feature of frequency
change. The frequency fr Hz of the secondary (or rotor) currents is then given by
