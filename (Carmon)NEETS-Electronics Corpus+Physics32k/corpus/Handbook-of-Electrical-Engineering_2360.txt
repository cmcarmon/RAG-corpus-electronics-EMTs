BTE is a simpliﬁed form of the Liouville–Von Neumann equation for the density matrix. In this approach,
the free ﬂight between two consecutive collisions of the carrier is considered to be under the inﬂuence of the
electric  ﬁeld,  whereas  different  scattering  mechanisms  determine  how  and  when  the  carrier  will  undergo  a
collision.
