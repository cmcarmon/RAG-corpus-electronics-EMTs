In selecting a switch for this task, you must remember that protection of the receiver input circuit is
as important as are output power considerations. At frequencies where amplifiers may be used, amplifier
tubes can be chosen to withstand large input powers without damage. However, the input circuit of the
receiver is easily damaged by large applied signals and must be carefully protected.
