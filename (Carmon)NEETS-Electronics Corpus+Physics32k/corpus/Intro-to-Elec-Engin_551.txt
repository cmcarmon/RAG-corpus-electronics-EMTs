Digital-to-Analog (D/A) Converters
For the results of digital computations to be used in the analog world, it becomes necessary to
convert the digital values to proportional analog values. Figure 6.2.8 shows the block diagram of
a typical digital-to-analog (D/A) converter, which accepts an n-bit parallel digital code as input
and provides an analog current or voltage as output. For an ideal D/A converter, the analog output
for an n-bit binary code is given by
