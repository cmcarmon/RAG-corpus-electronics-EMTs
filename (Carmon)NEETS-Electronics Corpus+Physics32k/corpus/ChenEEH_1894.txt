Error detection can be performed off-line, when the system
is inactive (or in an idle state), or online, when the system is
operational. The latter is referred to as concurrent error de-
tection. The detection of transient faults requires continuous
and concurrent error detection. Off-line checks usually include
the systematic testing of the system by supplying special input
test patterns to the components and investigating the outputs.
The purpose is either to check whether the component satisﬁes
the speciﬁcation or to reveal some faults. These types of checks
have high coverage but are expensive in resources and time,
and so they are rarely implemented as diagnostic checks during
the operational period of the system. For high availability-
requirement systems, such as Web and database servers, the
operational period is almost 100% of the time. Thus, concur-
rent error detection becomes very important for ensuring the
dependability of such systems.
