It was once expected that any icy body larger than approximately 200 km in radius was likely to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). However, Rhea is the smallest body where detailed measurements have been made and are consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium, whereas Iapetus is the largest determined not to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, bracketing a radius of 750 km.
For simplicity and comparative purposes, the values are manually calculated assuming a sphericity of 1. The size of solid bodies does not include an object's atmosphere. For example, Titan looks bigger than Ganymede, but its solid body is smaller. For the giant planets, the "radius" is the point at which the atmosphere reaches 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. The radius of Saturn's main rings is 136,775 km.
