Another aspect of the spectrum needs to be emphasized and this example demonstrates it well. Note
that the period T enters into the spectrum only through the ratio of the pulse width ∆ and the period. If
the period is changed in such a way that this ratio remains constant, the spectral plot in Figure (4.2) is
unchanged when considered as a function of coeﬃcient index k. However, when we plot a spectrum as a
function of frequency k/T , the plot stretches or compresses horizontally as we change the period. We will
ﬁnd that what is important in applications is what frequencies, not what harmonic indices, are contained in
a periodic signal.
