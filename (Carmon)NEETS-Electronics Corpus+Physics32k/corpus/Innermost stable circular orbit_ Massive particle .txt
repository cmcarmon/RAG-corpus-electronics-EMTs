For a non-spinning massive object, where the gravitational field can be expressed with the Schwarzschild metric, the ISCO is located at,

{\displaystyle r_{isco}={\frac {6\,GM}{c^{2}}}.}

As the angular momentum of the central object increases,

decreases. Even for a non-spinning object, the ISCO radius is only three times the Schwarzschild radius, suggesting that only black holes have innermost stable circular orbits outside of their surfaces.
