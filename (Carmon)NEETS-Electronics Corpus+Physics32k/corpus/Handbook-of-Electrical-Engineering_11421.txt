Here, NA – ND is the net charge density in the depleted or active region of the detector and d is the thickness
of this region. This is a key relationship in high-purity germanium technology as it quantiﬁes the effect of the
residual  impurity  concentration  on  device  size  and  depletion  voltage.  Techniques  to  grow  germanium  pure
enough for gamma detectors were pioneered by Hall [8] and the detector group at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory
[Haller, Hansen, and Goulding [9], based on puriﬁcation methods of Pfann [10] and crystal-growing techniques
developed by Teal and Little [11] to produce crystals for germanium transistors.
