The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such as those used in gridiron football or rugby football) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the normal force can act ahead or behind the centre of mass of the ball, and friction from the ground will depend on the alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the normal force and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.
