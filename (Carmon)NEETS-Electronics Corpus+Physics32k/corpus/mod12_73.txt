View (A) of figure 1-6 shows two impedances in parallel. View (B) plots the impedances both 
individually (Z1 and Z2) and combined (Z1 x Z2)/(Z1 + Z2). Note that Z1 and Z2 are not equal. At 100 
volts, Z1 has 1 ampere of current plotted at point b and Z2 has 0.5 ampere plotted at point f. The 
coordinates of the equivalent impedance of the parallel combination are found by adding the current 
through Z1 to the current through Z2. For example, at 100 volts, point b is added to point f to determine 
point j (1.5 amperes).
