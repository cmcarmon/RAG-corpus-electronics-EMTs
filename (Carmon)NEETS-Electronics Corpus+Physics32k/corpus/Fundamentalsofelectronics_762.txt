Thus, wavelength and frequency are inversely related: High frequency corresponds to small wavelengths.
For example, a 1 MHz electromagnetic ﬁeld has a wavelength of 300 m. Antennas having a size or distance
from the ground comparable to the wavelength radiate ﬁelds most eﬃciently. Consequently, the lower the
frequency the bigger the antenna must be. Because most information signals are baseband signals, having
spectral energy at low frequencies, they must be modulated to higher frequencies to be transmitted over
wireless channels.
