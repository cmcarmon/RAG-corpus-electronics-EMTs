The collision occurred around 2:30 local time on the morning of 5 May, 3.7 kilometres (2.3 mi) to the southwest of Po Toi Island. Poor visibility has been blamed for the collision, after heavy rain fell through the night; and Hong Kong experienced a "powerful" thunderstorm. Heavy rainfall and lightning may have caused problems with the ships' radars.
