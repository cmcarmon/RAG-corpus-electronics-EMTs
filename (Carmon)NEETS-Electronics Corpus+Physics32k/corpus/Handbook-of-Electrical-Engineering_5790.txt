The short-circuit current in a transformer creates enormous forces on the turns of the windings. The short-
circuit currents in a large transformer are typically 8 to 10 times larger than rated and in a small transformer
are 20 to 25 times rated. The forces on the windings due to the short-circuit current vary as the square of the
current, so whereas the forces at rated current may be only a few newtons, under short-circuit conditions these
forces can be tens of thousands of newtons. These mechanical and thermal stresses on the windings must be
taken  into  consideration  during  the  design  of  the  transformer.  The
current-carrying components must be clamped Ô¨Årmly to limit move-
ment.  The  solid  insulation  material  should  be  precompressed  and
formed to avoid its collapse due to the thermal expansion of the wind-
ings.
