The area thermal expansion coefficient relates the change in a material's area dimensions to a change in temperature. It is the fractional change in area per degree of temperature change. Ignoring pressure, we may write:





α

A


=


1
A






d
A


d
T





{\displaystyle \alpha _{A}={\frac {1}{A}}\,{\frac {dA}{dT}}}

where



A


{\displaystyle A}
is some area of interest on the object, and



d
A

/

d
T


{\displaystyle dA/dT}
is the rate of change of that area per unit change in temperature.
The change in the area can be estimated as:







Δ
A

A


=

α

A


Δ
T


{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta A}{A}}=\alpha _{A}\Delta T}

This equation works well as long as the area expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature



Δ
T


{\displaystyle \Delta T}
, and the fractional change in area is small



Δ
A

/

A
≪
1


{\displaystyle \Delta A/A\ll 1}
. If either of these conditions does not hold, the equation must be integrated.
