This action eliminates the noise of the local oscillator. Noise components introduced from the local
oscillator are in phase across the crystals and are, therefore, cancelled in the balanced transformer. The rf
characteristics of the crystals must be nearly equal, or the noise of the local oscillator will not completely
cancel. Note that only the noise produced by the local oscillator is canceled. Noise arriving with the echo
signal is not affected.
