Video Compression
Digital representations of video signals typically require a very large number of bits. If the video signal is to be
transmitted and/or stored, compression is often required. Applications include conventional and high-deﬁnition
television,  video  phone,  video  conferencing,  multi-media,  remote-sensed  imaging,  and  magnetic  resonance
imaging.  The  objective  of  compression  (source  encoding)  is  to  ﬁnd  a  representation  that  maximizes  picture
quality while minimizing the data per picture element (pixel). A wealth of compression algorithms have been
developed during the past 30 years for both image and video compression. However, the ultimate choice of an
appropriate algorithm is application dependent. The following summary will provide some guidance in that
selection process.
