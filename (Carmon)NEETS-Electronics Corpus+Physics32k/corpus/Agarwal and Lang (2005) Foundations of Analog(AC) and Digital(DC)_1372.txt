(10.10)
Equation 10.9 is called the characteristic equation of the system, and s = âˆ’1/RC
is a root of this characteristic equation. The characteristic equation summarizes
the fundamental dynamic properties of a circuit, and we will have much more
to say about it later chapters. For reasons that will become clear in Chapter 12,
the root of the characteristic equation, s, is also called the natural frequency
of the system.
