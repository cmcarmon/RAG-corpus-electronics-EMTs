A new experiment titled DarkLight is currently being conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which will search for dark photons with a known energy range of ~10-500 MeV/c². DarkLight will also concern the search for a dark gauge field A‘ by examining scattering processes off a windowless hydrogen gas target.
