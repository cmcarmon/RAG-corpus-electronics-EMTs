To  maximize  the  power  measured,  let  RL  =  R.  The  incremental  available  power  measured  is  then  PYY(d f )  =
4kTR2df /(4R2) = kTdf [see Ott, 1988, p. 201; Gardner, 1990, p. 288; or Peebles, 1987, p. 227]. Thus, we have
the result that incremental available power over bandwidth df depends only on the temperature T.
