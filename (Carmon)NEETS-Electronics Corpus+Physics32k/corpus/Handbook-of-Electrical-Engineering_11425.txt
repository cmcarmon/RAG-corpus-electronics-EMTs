A  variety  of  detector  geometries  is  shown  in  Fig. 116.9.  These  different  electrode  conﬁgurations  allow  the
detectors’ efﬁciency and energy resolution to be optimized for different gamma-ray energies and applications. For
example, the detector in Fig. 116.9(c) minimizes noise by the lower capacitance of its electrode conﬁguration at the
expense of the reduced stopping power. Thus, this detector would be more suitable for lower-energy gamma-rays.
