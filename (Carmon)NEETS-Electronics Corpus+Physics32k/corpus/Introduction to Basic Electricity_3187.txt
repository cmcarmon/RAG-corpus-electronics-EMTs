Each junction of a transistor exhibits a low resis-
tance when it is forward biased and a high  resistance 
when  reverse biased. The battery in the ohmmeter is 
the source of the forward- and  reverse-bias  voltage. 
The exact resistance measured varies with  different 
types of transistors, but there is always a change
