The imbalance of electrons between the atoms in the wax and the atoms in the wool creates
a force between the two materials. With no path for electrons to ﬂow from the wax to the
wool, all this force can do is attract the two objects together. Now that a conductor bridges the
insulating gap, however, the force will provoke electrons to ﬂow in a uniform direction through
the wire, if only momentarily, until the charge in that area neutralizes and the force between
the wax and wool diminishes.
