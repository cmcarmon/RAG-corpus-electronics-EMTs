1. Consider the common-emitter ampliﬁer shown below with values VCC = 12 V, R1 =
47 kΩ, R2 = 12 kΩ, RC = 2.7 kΩ, RE = 1 kΩ, and a forward-bias voltage drop
across the base-emitter junction of 0.7 V. Calculate approximate values for VB, VE,
IC, VC, and the voltage gain. Using the measured h parameters hie = 3600 Ω and
hf e = 150, calculate the input impedance, base current, and voltage gain. Compare
your calculated voltage gain with your approximation.
