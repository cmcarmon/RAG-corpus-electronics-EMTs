long time delay lines can be realized, for which the ordinary
planar lines are not amenable in practice. Generally, the super-
conducting technologies are expensive, and they are widely
studied for planar passive components that require special
dielectric substrates in support of superconducting thin Ô¨Ålms,
such as MgO and LaAlO3.
