Control
Microprocessors are ubiquitous in control applications. While some custom analog controllers are still built,
the advantages of cost and ﬂexibility inherent in microprocessors make them a natural choice. The advantages
of microprocessors are particularly obvious in mass-produced goods where time-to-market can be a signiﬁcant
driving force.
