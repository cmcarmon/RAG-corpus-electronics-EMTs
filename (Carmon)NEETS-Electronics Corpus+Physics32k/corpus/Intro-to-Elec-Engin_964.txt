11.6.3 A two-winding, 15-kVA, 2300:115-V, 60-Hz,
single-phase transformer, which is known to have
a core loss of 75 W and a copper loss of 250 W, is
connected as an autotransformer to step up 2300
V to 2415 V. With a load of 0.8 power factor
lagging, what kVA load can be supplied without
exceeding the current rating of any winding?
Determine the efÔ¨Åciency at this load.
