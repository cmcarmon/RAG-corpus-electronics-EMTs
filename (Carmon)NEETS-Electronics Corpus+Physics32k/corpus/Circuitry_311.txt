Output resistance and voltage regulation 
 
In a perfect power supply, the output voltage would 
remain constant regardless of the current taken by 
the  load.  In  practice,  however,  the  output  voltage 
falls  as  the  load  current  increases.  To  account  for 
this fact, we say that the power supply has internal 
resistance  (ideally  this  should  be  zero).  This 
internal  resistance  appears  at  the  output  of  the 
supply  and  is  defined  as  the  change  in  output 
voltage  divided  by  the  corresponding  change  in 
output current. Hence:
