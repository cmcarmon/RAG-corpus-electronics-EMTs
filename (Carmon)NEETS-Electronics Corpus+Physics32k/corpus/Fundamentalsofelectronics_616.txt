5.10 Spectrograms24
We know how to acquire analog signals for digital processing by A/D conversion (Section 5.4), consisting
of pre-ﬁltering, sampling and amplitude quantization, and to compute spectra of discrete-time signals using
the FFT algorithm (Section 5.9). Let’s put these various components together to learn how the spectrogram
shown in Figure 5.14, which is used to analyze speech, is calculated. The speech was sampled at a rate of
11.025 kHz and passed through a 16-bit A/D converter.
