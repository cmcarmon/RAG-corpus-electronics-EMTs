In April 2009, Wildlife Acoustics released an ultrasonic capable version of the SM2BAT. The bat detector records in full spectrum at 192 kHz sample rate and the files can be converted to zero-cross files in post processing. The SM2BAT can record two channels simultaneously allowing a second microphone to be mounted up to 100m away from the recorder. With 4 SDHC cards the device can record about 240 nights of bat calls. In August 2009 a one channel 384 kHz sample rate version was added to allow recording of higher frequency bats common in some areas of Europe.
