Examples include the underside of the Ferrari LaFerrari, which features a nolder to assist with vehicle dynamics. The Ferrari 599 GTO features prominent flanking aerodynamic fins or flying buttresses aside the rear window, maximizing air flow to a linear rear nolder. The Ferrari 355 has a similar nolder profile at the upper portion of its tail.
The Koenigsegg CCXR features an optional front splitter with a nolder, and the spoiler at the rear bumper of the Maserati 320S features a supplementary nolder to increase the vertical load to the rear.
For airflow management and to assist in keeping the rear window free from dirt, nolders are integral to the rearmost vertical pillar of Mini Cooper models and Fiat 500L.
