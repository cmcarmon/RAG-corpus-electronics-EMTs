The effective area Ae of a receiving antenna is deﬁned as the
ratio of the load power PL and the incident power density Pdinc.
The receiving antenna is seen as an equivalent capture area for
the incident wave. The equivalent area Ae of an antenna may
be clearly distinguished from the physical area of an antenna
because, in general, they can be signiﬁcantly different from
each other. For example, a commonly used wire antenna has
a nonzero effective area allowing a fairly good reception,
whereas its physical area is very small—practically zero:
