As discussed earlier in the common-emitter amplifier configuration (figure 2-17), there is a 
180-degree phase difference between the base and the collector signal. To obtain the regenerative 
feedback in the phase-shift oscillator, you need a phase shift of 180 degrees between the output and the 
input signal. An RC network consisting of three RC sections provides the proper feedback and phase 
inversion to provide this regenerative feedback. Each section shifts the feedback signal 60 degrees in 
phase.
