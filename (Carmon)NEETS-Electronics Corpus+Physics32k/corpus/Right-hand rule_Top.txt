In mathematics and physics, the right-hand rule is a common mnemonic for understanding orientation conventions for vectors in three dimensions.
Most of the various left- and right-hand rules arise from the fact that the three axes of three-dimensional space have two possible orientations. This can be seen by holding your hands outward and together, palms up, with the fingers curled. If the curl of your fingers represents a movement from the first or x-axis to the second or y-axis, then the third or z-axis can point along either thumb. Left- and right-hand rules arise when dealing with coordinate axes, rotation, spirals, electromagnetic fields, mirror images, and enantiomers in mathematics and chemistry. It states that " If index finger, middle finger and thumb are stretched of right hand in such way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other then if index finger gives the direction of current and middle finger shows the direction of magnetic field then thumb will show the direction of force acting on the conductor" .
