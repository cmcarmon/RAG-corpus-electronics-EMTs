As discussed in section 1.3, an ideal voltage source will maintain a given voltage 
across  a  circuit  by  providing  any  amount  of  current  necessary  to  do  so;  and  an  ideal 
current source will supply a given amount of current to a circuit by providing any amount 
of voltage output necessary to do so. Of course, ideal voltage sources and ideal current 
sources are both impossible in practice. When a very small resistive load is connected 
across  an  ideal  voltage  source,  a  practically  infinite  amount  of  current  is  required. 
Correspondingly, when a large resistive load is connected across an ideal current source, 
an exceedingly large voltage is required.
