The reason the rotation of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the Coriolis Effect. As summarized in the Coriolis effect article, the effect is greatest in polar regions where the surface of the Earth is at right angles to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum aligns with the Earth's axis of rotation). The Coriolis effect decreases nearer the equator because the surface of the Earth is parallel to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the Earth's axis of rotation). Refer to the article discussing the Coriolis Effect for further details.
The motion of ballistics with changing latitude is not helpful to understanding the change with latitude of the observed rotation time of the pendulum. (This discussion point is different from what is stated in the reference book.) There is only one point of connection to the Earth for the swinging pendulum and that point of connection doesn't move in relation to the Earth. Because the plane of the pendulum swing is free to swing in relation to the rotation of the structure of the connection point, the rotation of the Earth is observable as directly related to the magnitude of the Coriolis effect. The examples show that the Earth turns underneath the plane of the pendulum swing and how this change in relationship can be interpreted at different latitudes by evaluating the surface velocity components underneath the swing of the pendulum.
