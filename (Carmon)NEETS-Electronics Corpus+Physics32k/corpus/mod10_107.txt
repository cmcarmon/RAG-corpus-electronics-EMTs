The intensity of sound, at a given distance, depends upon the amplitude of the waves. Thus, a tuning
fork gives out more energy in the form of sound when struck hard than when struck gently. You should
remember that when a tuning fork is struck, the sound is omnidirectional (heard in all directions), because
the sound waves spread out in all directions, as shown in figure 1-14. You can see from the figure that as
the distance between the waves and the sound source increases, the energy in each wave spreads over a
greater area; hence, the intensity of the sound decreases. The speaking tubes sometimes used aboard a
ship prevent the sound waves from spreading in all directions by concentrating them in one desired
direction (unidirectional), producing greater intensity. Therefore, the sound is heard almost at its original
intensity at the opposite end of the speaking tube. The unidirectional megaphone and the directional
loudspeaker also prevent sound waves from spreading in all directions.
