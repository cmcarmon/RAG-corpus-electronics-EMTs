Bioelectric signals are exploited for the diagnostic information that they contain. Such signals are often used
to monitor and guide therapy. Although all living cells exhibit bioelectric phenomena, a small variety produce
potential  changes  that  reveal  their  physiological  function.  The  most  familiar  bioelectric  recordings  are  the
electrocardiogram, ECG (which reﬂects the excitation and recovery of the whole heart), the electromyogram,
EMG (which reﬂects the activity of skeletal muscle), and the electroencephalogram, EEG (which reﬂects the
activity of the outer layers of the brain, the cortex). The following paragraphs will describe (1) the origin of
