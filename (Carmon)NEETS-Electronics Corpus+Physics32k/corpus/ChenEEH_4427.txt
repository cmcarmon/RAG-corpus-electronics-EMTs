Most physical systems, however, are not inherently passive,
and passivity-based control methods cannot extend directly to
such systems. For example, unstable systems and acoustic
systems are not passive. One possible method of making
these nonpassive systems amenable to passivity-based control
is to passify them using suitable compensation. If the compen-
sated system is ensured to be robustly passive despite plant
uncertainties, it can be robustly stabilized by any MSPR con-
troller. In Kelkar and Joshi (1997), various passiÔ¨Åcation tech-
