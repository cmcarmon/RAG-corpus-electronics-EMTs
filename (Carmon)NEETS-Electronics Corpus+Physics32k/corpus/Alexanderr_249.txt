Solution:
We  may  replace  the  op  amp  in  Fig.  5.7  by  its  equivalent  model  in
Fig. 5.9 as we did in Example 5.1. But we do not really need to do
this. We just need to keep Eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) in mind as we analyze
the  circuit  in  Fig.  5.7.  Thus,  the  Fig.  5.7  circuit  is  presented  as  in
Fig.  5.9.  Notice  that
