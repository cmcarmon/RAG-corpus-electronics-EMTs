Special components called resistors are made for the express purpose of creating a precise
quantity of resistance for insertion into a circuit. They are typically constructed of metal wire
or carbon, and engineered to maintain a stable resistance value over a wide range of environ-
mental conditions. Unlike lamps, they do not produce light, but they do produce heat as electric
power is dissipated by them in a working circuit. Typically, though, the purpose of a resistor is
not to produce usable heat, but simply to provide a precise quantity of electrical resistance.
