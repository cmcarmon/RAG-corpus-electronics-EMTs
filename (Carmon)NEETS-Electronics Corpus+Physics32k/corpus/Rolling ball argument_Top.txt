In topology, quantum mechanics and geometrodynamics, rolling-ball arguments are used to describe how the perceived geometry and connectedness of a surface can be scale-dependent.
If a researcher probes the shape of an intricately curved surface by rolling a ball across it, then features that are continually curved but whose curvature radius is smaller than the ball radius may appear in the ball's description of the geometry as abrupt points, barriers and singularities.
