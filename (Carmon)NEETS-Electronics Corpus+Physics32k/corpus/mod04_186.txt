As you know, flux is a cleaning agent to remove oxidation during soldering. Heating a metal causes 
rapid oxidation. Oxidation prevents solder from reacting chemically with a metal. Flux cleans the metal 
by removing the oxide layer. This operation is shown in figure 2-36. As the iron is moved in the direction 
shown, the boiling flux floats away the oxide film. The molten solder following the iron then fuses 
rapidly with the clean surface of the metal.
