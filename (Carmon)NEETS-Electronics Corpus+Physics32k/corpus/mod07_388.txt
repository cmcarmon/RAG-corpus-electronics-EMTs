Now that you know what each section does, let's trace an ac signal through the power supply. At this 
point you need to see how this signal is altered within each section of the power supply. Later on in the 
chapter you will see how these changes take place. In view B of figure 4-1, an input signal of 115 volts ac 
is applied to the primary of the transformer. The transformer is a step-up transformer with a turns ratio of 
1:3. You can calculate the output for this transformer by multiplying the input voltage by the ratio of turns 
in the primary to the ratio of turns in the secondary; therefore, 115 volts ac Ã— 3 = 345 volts ac (peak-to-
peak) at the output. Because each diode in the rectifier section conducts for 180 degrees of the 360-degree 
input, the output of the rectifier will be one-half, or approximately 173 volts of pulsating dc. The filter 
section, a network of resistors, capacitors, or inductors, controls the rise and fall time of the varying 
signal; consequently, the signal remains at a more constant dc level. You will see the filter process more 
clearly in the discussion of the actual filter circuits. The output of the filter is a signal of 110 volts dc, 
with ac ripple riding on the dc. The reason for the lower voltage (average voltage) will be explained later 
in this chapter. The regulator maintains its output at a constant 110-volt dc level, which is used by the 
electronic equipment (more commonly called the load).
