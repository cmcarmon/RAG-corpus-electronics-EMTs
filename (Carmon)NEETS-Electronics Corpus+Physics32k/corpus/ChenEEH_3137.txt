Reliable and economical transport of power from generating
stations to the load centers is accomplished by overhead lines
operating at a high voltage. Transmission by underground
cables is limited to special cases and for short spans as in
water crossings and in metropolitan areas. Currently in the
United States, there exists more than 200,000 miles of overhead
transmission lines and about 3500 miles of underground trans-
mission cables. Voltage in excess of 69 kV is considered trans-
mission, and voltage below 69 kV is considered distribution.
The conductor current for a given Kilovoltampere [kVA]
rating is inversely proportional to the voltage used; hence the
higher the voltage, lower is the current and even lower is the
power losses (I 2R) occurring during the transmission process.
In the United States, the highest transmission voltage used is
765 kV; in Canada, it is 735 kV; in Western Europe, it is 400 kV;
and in Japan, a 1000-kV line has been recently built. In most
countries, the transmission voltage varies between 220 and
500 kV.
