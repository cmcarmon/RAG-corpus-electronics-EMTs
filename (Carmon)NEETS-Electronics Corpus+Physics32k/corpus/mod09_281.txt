The HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is an improvement over the Armstrong oscillator. Although its 
frequency stability is not the best possible of all the oscillators, the Hartley oscillator can generate a wide 
range of frequencies and is very easy to tune. The Hartley will operate class C with self-bias for ordinary 
operation. It will operate class A when the output waveform must be of a constant voltage level or of a 
linear waveshape. The two versions of this oscillator are the series-fed and the shunt-fed. The main 
difference between the Armstrong and the Hartley oscillators lies in the design of the feedback (tickler) 
coil. A separate coil is not used. Instead, in the Hartley oscillator, the coil in the tank circuit is a split 
inductor. Current flow through one section induces a voltage in the other section to develop a feedback 
signal.
