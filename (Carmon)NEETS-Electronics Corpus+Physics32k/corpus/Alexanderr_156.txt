Nothing has had a greater impact on the transition from the “Indus-
trial Age”  to  the  “Age  of  the  Engineer”  than  the  transistor.  I am  sure
that Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain had no idea they would
have this incredible effect on our history. While working at Bell Lab-
oratories,  they  successfully  demonstrated  the  point-contact  transistor,
invented by Bardeen and Brattain in 1947, and the junction transistor,
which Shockley conceived in 1948 and successfully produced in 1951.
It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  idea  of  the  ﬁeld-effect  transistor,
the most commonly used one today, was ﬁrst conceived in 1925–1928
by  J.  E.  Lilienfeld,  a  German  immigrant  to  the  United  States. This  is
evident from his patents of what appears to be a ﬁeld-effect transistor.
Unfortunately,  the  technology  to  realize  this  device  had  to  wait  until
1954 when Shockley’s ﬁeld-effect transistor became a reality. Just think
what today would be like if we had this transistor 30 years earlier!
