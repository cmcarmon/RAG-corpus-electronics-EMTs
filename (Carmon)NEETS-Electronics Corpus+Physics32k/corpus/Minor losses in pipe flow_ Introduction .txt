Minor losses are a major part in calculating the flow, pressure, or energy reduction in piping systems. Liquid moving through pipes carries momentum and energy due to the forces acting upon it such as pressure and gravity. Just as certain aspects of the system can increase the fluids energy, there are components of the system that act against the fluid and reduce its energy, velocity, or momentum. Friction and minor losses in pipes are major contributing factors.
This article will focus on what geometries and components of piping are categorized as minor losses. It will explore to what extent these minor losses affect flow and discuss how to use derived values for these components to solve equations like Bernoulli analyses.
