Once the Keck array was completed in 2012, it was no longer cost-effective to continue to operate BICEP2. However, using the same technique as the Keck array to eliminate the large liquid helium dewar, a much larger telescope has been installed on the original BICEP telescope mount.
BICEP3 consists of a single telescope with the same 2560 detectors (observing at 95 GHz) as the five-telescope Keck array, but a 68 cm aperture, providing roughly twice the optical throughput of the entire Keck array. One consequence of the large focal plane is a larger 28Â° field of view, which will necessarily mean scanning some foreground-contaminated portions of the sky. It was installed at the pole in January 2015, and began collecting data on 15 May 2016.
