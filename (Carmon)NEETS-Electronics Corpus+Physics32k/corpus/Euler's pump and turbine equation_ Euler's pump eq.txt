Based on Eq.(1.13), Euler developed the equation for the pressure head created by the impeller (see Fig.1).

Yth : theoretical specific supply ; Ht  : theoretical head pressure  ; g : gravitational acceleration
For the case of a pelton turbine the static component of the head is zero, hence the equation reduces to (See Fig.2).
