Many ICs used in hobby electronics projects are assembled into dual in‐line 
packages (DIPs), such as the ones in Figure 11-6. DIPs (sometimes called 
DILs) are rectangular‐shaped plastic or ceramic packages with two parallel 
rows of leads, called pins, down either side. DIPs contain between 4 and 64 
pins, but the most common sizes are 8‐, 14‐, and 16‐pin.
