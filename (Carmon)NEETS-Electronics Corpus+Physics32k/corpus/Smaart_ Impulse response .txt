Smaart can be used to find the delay time between two signals, in which case the computer needs two input channels and the software uses dual-FFT mode. Called "Delay Locator", the software calculates the impulse responses of two continuous audio signals, finding the similarities in the signals and measuring how much time has elapsed between them. This is used to set delay times for delay towers at large outdoor sound systems, and it is used to set delay times for other loudspeaker zones in smaller systems. Veteran Van Halen touring sound engineer Jim Yakabuski calls such delay locator programs as Smaart a "must have" item, useful for quickly aligning sound system elements when setup time is limited.
