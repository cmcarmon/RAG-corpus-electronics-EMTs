A switch-type, variable tone control is illustrated in figure 2-24. With this method we use a three-
position switch to provide fixed degrees of tone control. When tone control S1 is in the BASS position,
capacitor C1 bypasses the high frequencies and provides bass emphasis. With S1 in the normal (NORM)
position, C2 acts as the bypass, and a moderate amount of high-frequency attenuation is accomplished.
This position provides balanced bass and treble response. When S1 is in the TREBLE position, C3 acts as
the bypass and provides minimum high-frequency attenuation and maximum treble emphasis. As a rule of
thumb, you can figure the capacitance of C2 is approximately five times the value of C3, and C1 is
approximately ten times the value of C3. For example with C3 at .001 microfarads, C2 would be .005
microfarads, and C1 would be .01 microfarads.
