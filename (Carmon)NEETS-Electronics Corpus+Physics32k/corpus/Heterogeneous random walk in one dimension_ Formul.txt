The actual random walk obeys a stochastic equation of motion. Yet, the probability density function (PDF) obeys a deterministic equation of motion. Formulation of PDFs of random walks can be done in terms of the discrete (in space) master equation and the generalized master equation or the continuum (in space and time) Fokker Planck equation and its generalizations. Continuous time random walks, renewal theory, and the path representation are also useful formulations of random walks. The network of relationships between the various descriptions provides a powerful tool in the analysis of random walks. Arbitrarily heterogeneous environments make the analysis difficult, especially in high dimensions.
