In digital communication, a huge amount of information is
transformed into a series of data bits by source coding (e.g.,
audio and video coding) and various forms of channel coding
(e.g., error correction) prior to the transmission. Therefore,
every bit of received data is so important that many algorithms
have been proposed and developed to save the communication
bandwidth and error resilience. Such algorithms include vari-
able length coding at the source coding level and Viterbi
decoding at the channel coding level.
