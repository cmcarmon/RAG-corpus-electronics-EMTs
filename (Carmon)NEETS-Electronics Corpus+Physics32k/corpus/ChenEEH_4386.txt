The transmission zero deﬁnition states that s ¼ sz is a zero if
the rank of NL(sz) is less than the rank of NL(s). An important
difference between SISO and transmission zeros is that a trans-
mission zero does not have to be a zero of any SISO transfer
function entry of G(s). Another difference is that it is possible
for G(s) to have a pole equal to a zero. To understand other
properties of poles and transmission zeros, such as multiplici-
ties, the Smith-McMillan form of G(s) can be used.
