The  computing  power  available  with  computer  relays  has  also  given  rise  to  newer  and  better  protection
functions  in  several  instances.  Improved  protection  of  transformers,  multiterminal  lines,  fault  location,  and
reclosing are a few of the protection functions where computer relaying is likely to have a signiﬁcant impact.
Very signiﬁcant developments in the computer relaying ﬁeld are likely to occur in the coming years.
