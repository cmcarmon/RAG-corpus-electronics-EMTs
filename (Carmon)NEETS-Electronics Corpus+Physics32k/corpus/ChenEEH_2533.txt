Hybrids and couplers (directional couplers) are important
in microwave and millimeter-wave systems
components
for rerouting or redistribution of
the signal (Cohn and
Levy, 1984). They are widely used in high-frequency signal
measurements, amplitude, phase and frequency discrimi-
nators, balanced ampliﬁers, balanced mixers, feeding networks
of antennas, and many other applications. In principle, a
hybrid or a coupler may simply be described as a reciprocal
multiport (usually four-port) network as shown in Figure 7.16.
Hybrids are special classes of directional couplers that use
commensurate line sections or junctions to connect ports or
arms. Branch-line couplers, hybrid-rings
(rat-race), and
magic-tees are the most widely used designs of the hybrids.
Their performance depends critically on the transmission line
properties. Couplers rated at a 3-dB power splitting ratio are
also often called hybrids. The designation of hybrid is not
consistently used in the literature. In the following paragraphs,
a hybrid describes a directional coupler consisting of several
line sections that are physically connected to each other via
junctions. Hybrids may be derived from all types of couplers,
and they may be classiﬁed as 908 (quadratic) hybrids or 1808
hybrids, depending on their circuit properties and application
features.
