ADCs perform a key function in the data acquisition process. The application of various ADC technologies
in a data acquisition system depends mainly on the cost, bit resolution, and speed. Successive approximation
types are more common at high resolution at moderate speeds (<1 MHz). This kind of ADC offers the best
trade-offs among bit resolution, accuracy, speed, and cost. Flash converters, on the other hand, are best suited
for high-speed applications. Integrating-type converters are suitable for high-resolution and -accuracy applications.
Many techniques have been developed in coupling sample-hold circuits and ADCs in data acquisition systems
because  no  single  ADC  or  sampling  technology  is  able  to  satisfy  the  ever  increasing  requirements  of  data
acquisition applications. Figure 84.6 illustrates the various sampling and ADC conﬁgurations used in practice.
It  can  be  seen  that  the  sampling  frequencies  are  increased  because  of  pipelining,  parallelism,  or  concurrent
architecture. The increase in the sampling frequency improves the bandwidth, improving in turn the SNR in
the channel.
