An automobile skid is an automobile handling condition where one or more tires are slipping relative to the road, and the overall handling of the vehicle has been affected.
Subtypes of skid include:
fishtailing, where the vehicle yaws back and forth across the direction of motion.
spin or spinout where a vehicle rotates in one direction during the skid.
understeer and oversteer where front or rear wheels lose traction during cornering, causing a vehicle to follow a larger or smaller turning radius.
Burnout where a vehicle slips or spins its tires during acceleration.
skidding during braking (with or without directional or yaw changes).
