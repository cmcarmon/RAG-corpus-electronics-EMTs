Most circuits satisfy such a restriction. But,
interestingly, an uninterrupted
5000-km power grid operating at 60 Hz, and a 30-cm computer mother-
board operating at 1 GHz, would not. Both systems are approximately one
wavelength in size so wave phenomena are very important to their operation
and they must be analyzed accordingly. Wave phenomena are now becoming
important to microprocessors as well. We will address this issue in more detail
in Section 1.4.
