You could keep track of that rotation by driving a big post into the Equator as shown in view A of 
figure 3-11. If this post were upright at 1200, the Earth's rotation would carry it around so it would be 
pointing to your right at 1800. Likewise, the Earth's rotation would carry the post around so that at 2400 it 
would be upside down. Then, at 0600 the next day, the post would be pointing to your left. Finally, at 
1200 the next day the post would be back in its original position, having been carried, with the Earth, 
through its complete rotation. Notice that the post has many positions as you observe itâ€”because it is 
attached to the Earth's surface and does not have rigidity in space.
