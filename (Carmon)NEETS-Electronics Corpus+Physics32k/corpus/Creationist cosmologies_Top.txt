Creationist cosmologies are explanations of the origins and form of the universe in terms of the Genesis creation narrative (Genesis 1), according to which God created the cosmos in eight creative acts over the Hexameron, six days of the "creation week":
Day 1: Creation of light, separation of light from darkness;
Day 2: Creation of the firmament, separation of waters above the Earth from waters below;
Day 3: Separation of waters below the firmament from the dry land; the Earth is commanded to produce vegetation;
Day 4: Creation of "lights" (Sun, Moon and stars) in the firmament;
Day 5: Creation of fish and birds to populate the sea and sky;
Day 6: Creation of animals (followed by) creation of mankind.
Young Earth creationists interpret the six days as six 24-hour periods; old Earth creationists allow for millions or even billions of years within the "creation week". Both regard the Genesis story as history, although some old earth creationists do not conflate the creation of the Earth and the universe, (i.e. they hold that the two are equally old and were created together).
