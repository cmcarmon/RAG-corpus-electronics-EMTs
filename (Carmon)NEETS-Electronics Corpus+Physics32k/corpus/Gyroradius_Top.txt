The gyroradius (also known as radius of gyration, Larmor radius or cyclotron radius) is the radius of the circular motion of a charged particle in the presence of a uniform magnetic field. In SI units, the gyroradius is given by

m

v

B





{\displaystyle r_{g}={\frac {mv_{\perp }}{|q|B}}}

where



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the particle,




v

⊥




{\displaystyle v_{\perp }}
is the component of the velocity perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field,



q


{\displaystyle q}
is the electric charge of the particle, and



B


{\displaystyle B}
is the strength of the magnetic field.
The angular frequency of this circular motion is known as the gyrofrequency, or cyclotron frequency, and can be expressed as
