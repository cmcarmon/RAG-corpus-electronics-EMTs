Extending Multimedia and Broadband Services to Mobile Users
Providing for the electronic transport of multimedia services is
a challenging one because of the inherent differences in voice,
data, image, and video trafÔ¨Åc as explained earlier. Extending
multimedia and bandwidth on-demand capabilities into the
wireless environment presents a number of challenges. In the
mobile, wireless world, available bandwidths (and, hence,
transmission rates) are typically limited by spectrum scarcity,
and the transmission links between the mobile and base sta-
tions are often characterized by high error rates and rapidly
changing performance. In addition, a mobile terminal that is
connected to one port on the network at one moment may be
connected to another one the next moment. Despite these
