where kZ1(y, u)k2  d0, 8(y, u)  (Y, U), and (Y, U) repre-
sent the desired working region, and d0 2 < is a known con-
stant. Thus, ^ff l, the realization of the real system with a known
bounded uncertainty in the desired working region of the
system, will be either a mathematical, numerical or a com-
bined realization; it is assumed that this realization is de-
veloped off-line and available. Equation 8.1 denotes a healthy
system under the fault-free situation and equation 8.2 is the
corresponding nominal model. Under different component
failures, the system dynamics are represented by the following
equation:
