Enthalpy of atomization is the amount of enthalpy change when a compound's bonds are broken and the component atoms are reduced to individual atoms.
Enthalpy of atomization is denoted by the symbol ΔHa. The enthalpy change of atomization of gaseous H2O is, for example, the sum of the HO–H and H–O bond dissociation enthalpies.
The enthalpy of atomization of an elemental solid is exactly the same as the enthalpy of sublimation for any elemental solid that becomes a monatomic gas upon evaporation.
When a diatomic element is converted to gaseous atoms, only half a mole of molecules will be needed, as the standard enthalpy change is based purely on the production of one mole of gaseous atoms. When the atoms in the molecule are different isotopes of the same element the calculation becomes non-trivial.
Standard enthalpy of atomization is the enthalpy change when 1 mol of gaseous atoms is formed from its element in its defined physical state under standard conditions (298.15K, 1 atm).
