This  corresponds  to  zero  phase  margin.  The  nominal  crossover  frequency  and  associated  pilot  gain  can  be
estimated from the condition to provide minimum mean-squared error in the presence of the appropriate form
of continuous attention remnant. “Remnant” is operator-induced noise; as described below it depends on the
nature  of  the  operator’s  equalization  and  is  larger  when  low-frequency  lead  is  required  to  make  good  the
crossover model. Thus, the need to generate lead impacts both the effective time delay and the remnant and,
accordingly,  the  crossover  frequency  for  which  the  minimum  mean-squared  error  is  obtained.  The  nominal
crossover frequency for full-attention operations can be estimated [McRuer et al., 1990] using
