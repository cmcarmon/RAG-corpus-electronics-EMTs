diode, see Fig. 5.5).

signal general-purpose NPN transistor operating in 
common-emitter  mode  (see  Chapter  7).  This 
characteristic  comprises  a  family  of  curves,  each 
relating to a different value of base current (IB). It is 
worth  taking  a  little  time  to  get  familiar  with  this 
characteristic as we shall be putting it to good use 
in Chapter 7. In particular it is important to note the 
‘knee’  that  occurs  at  values  of  VCE  of  about  2  V. 
Also, note how the curves become flattened above 
this  value  with  the  collector  current  (IC) not 
changing  very  greatly  for  a  comparatively  large 
change in collector-emitter voltage (VCE). 
  Finally,  a  typical  transfer  characteristic  (IC
plotted  against  IB)
for  a  small-signal  general- 
purpose  NPN  transistor  operating  in  common-
emitter mode (see Chapter 7) is shown in Fig. 5.23.
