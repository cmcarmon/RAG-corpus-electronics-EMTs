Hand tools are necessary for building electronics cir-
cuits. In the electronics workshop, hand tools are of 
great importance in what they are, what they will be 
used for, and how to use them. Most of the tools in the 
electronics workshop can be divided into groups by 
their use. Each tool has a special purpose and it is im-
portant for the electronics technician to know its pur-
pose. Every prospective electronics technician should 
also learn how to care for the tools they use so each 
tool can function at its full potential.
