Figure 2.9: The system depicted has input x (t) and output y (t). Mathematically, systems operate on
function(s) to produce other function(s). In many ways, systems are like functions, rules that yield a
value for the dependent variable (our output signal) for each value of its independent variable (its input
signal). The notation y (t) = S [x (t)] corresponds to this block diagram. We term S [Â·] the input-output
relation for the system.
