Intermodal dispersion occurs in multimode ﬁbers because rays associated with different modes travel different
effective distances through the optical ﬁber. This causes light in the different modes to spread out temporally as
it travels along the ﬁber. Modal delay distortion can severely limit the bandwidth of a step-index multimode ﬁber
to the order of 20 MHz-km. To reduce modal delay distortion in multimode ﬁbers, the core is carefully doped to
create a graded (approximately parabolic shaped) refractive index proﬁle. By carefully designing this index proﬁle,
the  group  velocities  of  the  propagating  modes  are  nearly  equalized.  Bandwidths  of  1.0  GHz-km  are  readily
attainable  in  commercially  available  graded-index  multimode  ﬁbers.  The  most  effective  way  of  eliminating
intermodal dispersion is to use a single-mode ﬁber. Since only one mode propagates in a single-mode ﬁber,
modal delay distortion between modes does not exist and very high bandwidths are possible. The bandwidth
of  a  single-mode  ﬁber,  as  mentioned  previously,  is  limited  by  the  combination  of  material  and  waveguide
dispersion. As shown in Fig. 42.18, both material and waveguide dispersion are dependent on wavelength.
