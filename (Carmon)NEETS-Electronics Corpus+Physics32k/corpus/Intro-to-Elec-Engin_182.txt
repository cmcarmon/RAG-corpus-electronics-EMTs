Linearity requires both additivity and homogeneity. For a linear circuit or system in which
excitations x1 and x2 produce responses y1 and y2, respectively, the application of K1x1 and
K2x2 together (i.e., K1x1 + K2x2) results in a response of (K1y1 + K2y2), where K1 and K2
are constants. With the cause-and-effect relation between the excitation and the response, all
linear systems satisfy the principle of superposition. A circuit consisting of independent sources,
linear dependent sources, and linear elements is said to be a linear circuit. Note that a resistive
element is linear. Capacitors and inductors are also circuit elements that have a linear inputâ€“output
relationship provided that their initial stored energy is zero. Nonzero initial conditions are to be
treated as independent sources.
