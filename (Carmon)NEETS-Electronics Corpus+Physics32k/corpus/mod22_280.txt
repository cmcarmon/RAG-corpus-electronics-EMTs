The development of mnemonic techniques and macroinstructions led to the development of 
procedure-oriented languages. Macroinstructions allow the programmer to write a single instruction that 
is equivalent to a specified sequence of machine instructions. These procedure-oriented languages are 
oriented toward a specific class of processing problems. A class of similar problems is isolated, and a 
language is developed to process these types of applications. Several languages have been designed to 
process problems of a scientific-mathematical nature and others that emphasize file processing.
