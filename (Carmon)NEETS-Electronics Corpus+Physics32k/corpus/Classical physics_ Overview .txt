Classical theory has at least two distinct meanings in physics. In the context of quantum mechanics, classical theory refers to theories of physics that do not use the quantisation paradigm, which includes classical mechanics and relativity. Likewise, classical field theories, such as general relativity and classical electromagnetism, are those that do not use quantum mechanics. In the context of general and special relativity, classical theories are those that obey Galilean relativity.
Depending on point of view, among the branches of theory sometimes included in classical physics are variably:
Classical mechanics
Newton's laws of motion
Classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms

Classical electrodynamics (Maxwell's Equations)
Classical thermodynamics
Special relativity and general relativity
Classical chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics
