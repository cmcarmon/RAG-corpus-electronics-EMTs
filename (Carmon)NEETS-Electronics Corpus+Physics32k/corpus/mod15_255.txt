The TX-TDX-TR SYSTEM performs subtraction when the system contains standard synchro 
connections. Addition can also be performed with this system by reversing the S1 and S3 leads between 
the TX and the TDX, and the R1 and R3 leads between the TDX and the TR. Remember, this system 
works like a basic synchro system when the rotor of the TDX is on 0ยบ; in this condition the TR rotor 
follows the TX rotor exactly.
