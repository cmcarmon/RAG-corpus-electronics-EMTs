(a) From the principle of duality and for the given values, it follows that the inductor-voltage
waveform is the same as the capacitor-current waveform of Example 1.2.3(a), in which
i(t) is to be replaced by v(t), and 25 and −50 mA are to be replaced by 25 and −50 mV.
The stored energy w(t) is the same as in the solution of Example 1.2.3(a).
