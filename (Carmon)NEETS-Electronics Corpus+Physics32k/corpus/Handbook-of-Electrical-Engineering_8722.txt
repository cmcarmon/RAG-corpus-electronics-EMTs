The actual allocation of storage is not known until the program executes the sequence of new() functions
in the body of the program. Each new() function allocates space according to the type statement and returns
a pointer to that space. To access the actual values in these storage spaces, the up arrow, ^, is written following
the variable name. Thus, the read() function gets a number from the keyboard and puts it in the space pointed
to by the pointer variable. Similarly, the value of X is computed by indirect reference to each value stored at
the newly allocated memory location.
