Located within each disk drive unit is a drive motor that rotates the disk at a constant speed, 
normally 3,600 revolutions per minute (rpm); or, if you prefer, 60 revolutions per second. The rotational 
speed for floppy disks is usually between 300 and 400 rpm because of their plastic base. Data is written 
on the tracks of a spinning disk surface and read from the surface by one or more (multiple) read/write 
heads. When reading from and writing to hard disks (rigid disks), the read/write heads float on a cushion 
of air and do not actually touch the surface of the disk. The distance between the head and the surface 
varies from a millionth of an inch to one-half millionth of an inch. This distance is called the flying 
height. When multiple disks (platters) are packaged together as a unit in a disk pack, a number of access 
arms and read/write heads are used to access both surfaces of each platter (fig. 2-21). The disk pack 
shown consists of six metal disks mounted on a central spindle. Data can be recorded on all surfaces 
except the top surface of the top disk, and the bottom surface of the bottom disk. These two surfaces are 
intentionally left blank for protection.
