PMN: Generic name for electrostrictive materials of the lead (Pb) magnesium niobate family.
Polarization: The polarization is the amount of charge associated with the dipolar or free charge in a ferroelectric
or an electret, respectively. For dipoles the direction of the polarization is the direction of the dipole. The
polarization is equal to the external charge which must be supplied to the material to produce a polarized
state  from  a  random  state  (twice  that  amount  is  necessary  to  reverse  the  polarization).  The  statement  is
rigorously true if all movable charges in the material are reoriented (i.e., saturation can be achieved).
