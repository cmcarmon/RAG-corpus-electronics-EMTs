In the analysis of the system, various assumptions are made. The liquid, conventionally denoted A, is neither soluble in the gas in the tube, conventionally denoted B, nor reacts with it. The decrease in volume of the liquid A and increase in volume of the gas B over time can be ignored for the purposes of solving the equations that describe the behaviour, and an assumption can be made that the instantaneous flux at any time is the steady state value. There are no radial or circumferential components to the concentration gradients, resulting from convection or turbulence caused by excessively vigorous flow at the upper mouth of the tube, and the diffusion can thus be treated as a simple one-dimensional flow in the vertical direction. The mole fraction of A at the upper mouth of the tube is zero, as a consequence of the gas flow. At the interface between A and B the flux of B is zero (because it is insoluble in A) and the mole fraction is the equilibrium value.
The flux of B, denoted NB, is thus zero throughout the tube, its diffusive flux downward (along its concentration gradient) is balanced by its convective flux upward caused by A.
Applying these assumptions, the system can be modelled using Fick's laws of diffusion or as Maxwellâ€“Stefan diffusion.
