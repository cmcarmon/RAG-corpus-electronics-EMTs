An increase in the charge Q or a decrease in the capacitance C causes an increase in the voltage 
across the plates. Thus, a voltage increase, or amplification, can be obtained by mechanically or 
electronically varying the amount of capacitance in the circuit. In practice a voltage-variable capacitance, 
such as a varactor, is used. The energy required to vary the capacitance is obtained from an electrical 
source called a PUMP.
