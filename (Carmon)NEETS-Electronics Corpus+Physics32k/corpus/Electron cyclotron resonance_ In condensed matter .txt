Within a solid the mass in the cyclotron frequency equation above is replaced with the effective mass tensor

{\displaystyle m^{*}}
. Cyclotron resonance is therefore a useful technique to measure effective mass and Fermi surface cross-section in solids. In a sufficiently high magnetic field at low temperature in a relatively pure material
