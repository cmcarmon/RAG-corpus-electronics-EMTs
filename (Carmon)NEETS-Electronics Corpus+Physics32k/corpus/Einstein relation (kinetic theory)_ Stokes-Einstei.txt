In the limit of low Reynolds number, the mobility μ is the inverse of the drag coefficient

is frequently used for the inverse momentum relaxation time (time needed for the inertia momentum to become negligible compared to the random momenta) of the diffusive object. For spherical particles of radius r, Stokes' law gives
