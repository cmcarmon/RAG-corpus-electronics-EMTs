Consider an atom entering the cavity initially in its excited state, while the cavity is initially in the vacuum state. Then the state of the atom-field system as a function of time is:

{\displaystyle |\psi (t)\rangle =\cos {\Big (}{\frac {\Omega t}{2}}{\Big )}|e,0\rangle -i\sin {\Big (}{\frac {\Omega t}{2}}{\Big )}|g,1\rangle }

So the probabilities to find the system in the ground or excited states after interacting with the cavity for a time

{\displaystyle t}
are:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}P_{e}(t)&=|\langle e,0|\psi (t)\rangle |^{2}=\cos ^{2}{\Big (}{\frac {\Omega t}{2}}{\Big )}\\P_{g}(t)&=|\langle g,1|\psi (t)\rangle |^{2}=\sin ^{2}{\Big (}{\frac {\Omega t}{2}}{\Big )}\\\end{aligned}}}

Thus the probability amplitude to find the atom in either state oscillates. This is the quantum mechanical explanation for the phenomenon of vacuum Rabi oscillation. In this case, there was only a single quantum in the atom-field system, carried in by the initially excited atom. In general, the Rabi oscillation associated with an atom-field system of

{\displaystyle n}
quanta will have frequency

{\displaystyle \Omega _{n}={\frac {{\sqrt {n}}\Omega }{2}}}
. As explained below, this discrete spectrum of frequencies is the underlying reason for the collapses and subsequent revivals probabilities in the model.
