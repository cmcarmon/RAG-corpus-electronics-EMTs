A common variation on the above design is to place “dummy” copper pads under the center of the part.
Since these pads are etched and plated at the same time as the actual solder pads, the variation in metal height
Y is eliminated as an issue. Adhesive dots are placed on the dummy pads and X > Z is the primary concern.
