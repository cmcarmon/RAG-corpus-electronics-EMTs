Each vertex from V (C) represents a register of the circuit C.
There is exactly one edge in E(C) for every sequentially adjacent
: E(C)7!R and
pair of registers
: E(C)7!R to the set of real numbers R assign the lower
h(C)
lk, uk 2 R, respectively,
u
and upper permissible range bounds,
for the sequentially adjacent pair of registers indicated by the
edge ek 2 E. The edge labeling h(C)
deﬁnes a direction of signal
propagation for each edge vx, ez, vy.
