In a SERIES LIMITER, a diode is connected in series with the output, as shown in view (A) of 
figure 4-1. The input signal is applied across the diode and resistor and the output is taken across the 
resistor. The series-limiter circuit can limit either the positive or negative alternation, depending on the 
polarity of the diode connection with respect to ground. The circuit shown in figure 4-1, view (B), is a 
SERIES-POSITIVE LIMITER. Reversing D1 would change the circuit to a SERIES-NEGATIVE 
LIMITER.
