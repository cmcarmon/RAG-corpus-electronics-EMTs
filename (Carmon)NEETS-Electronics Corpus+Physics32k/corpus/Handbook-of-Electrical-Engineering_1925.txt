Off-the-shelf programmable digital signal processors can lead to faster prototyping. These prototyped systems
can prove very effective in fast simulation of computation-intensive algorithms (such as those encountered in
speech recognition, video compression, and seismic signal processing) or in benchmarking and standardization.
After standards are determined, it is more useful to implement the algorithms using dedicated circuits.
