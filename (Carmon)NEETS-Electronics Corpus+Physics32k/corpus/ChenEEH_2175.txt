The maximum B that the material attains for any H is called
the saturated B, Bs in Figure 1.6, corresponding to total align-
ment of domains. When H is then reduced from this point to
zero, B reduces to Br, which is the remanent B ﬁeld or rema-
nance. The negative (or antiparallel) H required to further
reduce B to zero is Hc , the coercivity. Materials with a large
Hc (called hard ferromagnetic materials) expend more energy
per complete transversal of the hysteresis curve and conse-
quently ﬁnd applications as permanent magnets (see the next
section). Conversely, materials with small Hc (called soft ferro-
magnetic materials) expend much less energy per hysteresis-
curve cycle and ﬁnd uses in transformers, relays, and generators.
The properties of a few selected soft ferromagnetic materials
are listed in Table 1.4, including m along the initial magnetiza-
tion curve in Figure 1.6 and the maximum m found anywhere
along the hysteresis curve.
