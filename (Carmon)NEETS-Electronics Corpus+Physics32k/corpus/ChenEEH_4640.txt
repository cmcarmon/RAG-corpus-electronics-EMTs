the parameter dependence is multiafﬁne, then it is sufﬁcient to
evaluate the matrix inequalities simultaneously at the vertices
of the polytope. If the dimension of Q is small enough, the
resulting set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) can typically
be solved quickly using commercially available software on
desktop computers. If the parameter dependence in the system
matrix coefﬁcients is linear fractional, then a technique known
as the S-procedure (Boyd et al., 1994) may be applied, though
this technique can yield conservative results (Apkarian and
Adams, 1998).
