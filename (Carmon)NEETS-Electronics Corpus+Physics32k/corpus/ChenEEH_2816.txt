This expression has proven to be adequate for many applica-
tions. Its value, however, may be too large when the PML
terminates highly elongated resonant structures or sources
with a very long time duration. For detailed discussions and
examples of PML performance over a wide range of possible
loss proﬁles, see Gedney (1998) and Gedney and Taﬂove
(2000).
