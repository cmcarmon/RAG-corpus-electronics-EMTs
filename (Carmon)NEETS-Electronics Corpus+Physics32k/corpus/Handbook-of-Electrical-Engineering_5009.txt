where  Nc  denotes  the  critical  number  of  impact  ionizations  necessary  for  tree  channel  formation,  l  is  the
avalanche or newly formed tree length, no is the number of initiating electrons and b is a constant dependent
on the frequency, f. The deterioration rate due to partial discharges is proportional to the power dissipated P
by the discharges, which may be expressed as [Bartnikas and McMahon, 1979]
