The circuit in which restoration is achieved is called the DETECTOR or DEMODULATOR (both of
these terms are used in NEETS). The term demodulator is used because the demodulation process is
considered to be the opposite of modulation. The output of an ideal detector must be an exact
reproduction of the modulation existing on the rf wave. Failure to accurately recover this intelligence will
result in distortion and degradation of the demodulated signal and intelligence will be lost. The distortion
may be in amplitude, frequency, or phase, depending on the nature of the demodulator. A nonlinear
device is required for demodulation. This nonlinear device is required to recover the modulating
frequencies from the rf envelope. Solid-state detector circuits may be either a pn junction diode or the
input junction of a transistor. In electron-tube circuits, either a diode or the grid or plate circuits of a
triode electron tube may be used as the nonlinear device.
