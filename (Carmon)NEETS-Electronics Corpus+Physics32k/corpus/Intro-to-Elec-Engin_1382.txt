In the frequency bands that are primarily used to provide navigational aids from shore to
ships around the world (VLF to LF to MF), the available channel bandwidths are relatively small,
and hence the information that is transmitted through these channels is relatively slow speed and
generally conÔ¨Åned to digital transmission. Noise at these frequencies is caused by thunderstorm
activity around the globe, whereas interference is caused by the many users.
