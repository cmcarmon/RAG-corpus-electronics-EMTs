Digital multimeters display each measurement result as a precise number, 
taking the guesswork out of the reading process. Most handheld digital multi-
meters are accurate to within 0.8% for DC voltages; the pricey bench‚Äêtop vari-
eties are over 50 times more accurate. Many digital multimeters also include 
an autoranging feature, which means that the meter automatically adjusts 
itself to display the most accurate result possible. Some have special testing 
features for checking diodes, capacitors, and transistors.
