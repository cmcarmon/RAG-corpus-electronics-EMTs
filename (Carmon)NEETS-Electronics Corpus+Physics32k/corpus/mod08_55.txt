Figure 1-3 shows a simple block diagram of a voltage amplifier with its input and output signals and 
a power amplifier with its input and output signals. Notice that in view (A) the output signal voltage is 
larger than the input signal voltage. Since the current values for the input and output signals are not 
shown, you cannot tell if there is a power gain in addition to the voltage gain.
