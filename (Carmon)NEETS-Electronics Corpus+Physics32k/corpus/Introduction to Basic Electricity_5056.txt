After the printed circuit board has been etched, the 
resist must be removed. Remove the printed cir-
cuit board from the acid, rinse it thoroughly in run-
ning water, and dry it. Soaking the board in a solvent, 
scrubbing it with powder cleanser, or using steel wool 
to rub it off can remove the resist. After the resist is re-
moved from the printed circuit board, be sure to avoid 
getting fingerprints on the board.
