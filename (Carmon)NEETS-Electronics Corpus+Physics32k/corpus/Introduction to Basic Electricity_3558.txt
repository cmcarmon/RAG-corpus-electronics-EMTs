After the LED is formed, it is mounted in a  package 
designed for optimum emission of light. Figure 35-14  
shows some of the more common LED packages and 
colors. Most LEDs contain a lens that gathers and 
 intensifies the light. The case may act as a colored filter 
to enhance the natural light emitted.
