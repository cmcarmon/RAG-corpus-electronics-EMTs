Light is a form of energy. It can be produced by various means (mechanical, electrical, chemical,
etc.). We can see objects because the light rays they give off or reflect reach our eyes. If the object is the
source of light energy, it is called luminous. If the object is not the source of light but reflects light, it is
called an illuminated body.
