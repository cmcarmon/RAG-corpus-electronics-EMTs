The GW151226 event suggests that there is a large population of binary black holes in the Universe that will produce frequent mergers.
The measured gravitational wave is completely consistent with the predictions of general relativity for strong gravitational fields. The theory's strong-field predictions had not been directly tested before the two LIGO events. General relativity passed this most stringent test for the second time.
