Categories of Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems
Here, the concern is with electromagnetic inverse scattering or
electromagnetic imaging problem for which the electromag-
netic wave is used as a probing tool. From different aspects, we
can classify the electromagnetic inverse scattering problems in
various ways. According to the physical properties of the
material, the object may be a conductor (for which the infor-
mation to be reconstructed is the shape function) or a dielec-
tric (for which the dielectric constant distribution and hence
also the shape function are to be reconstructed). Moreover, the
dielectric object can be homogeneous or inhomogeneous, and
different inversion algorithms may apply. According to the
environment in which the object is embedded, there may be
whole-space problem or half-space problem. The latter is more
difﬁcult than the former due to the complexity of Green’s
function and the geometric limitation on the data measure-
ment for the buried object. According to the dimensionality,
the inverse scattering problem may be of one, two, or three
dimensions. The one-dimensional problems, which are related
to the remote sensing of layered media, have been intensively
investigated. There still remain difﬁculties, however, in the
two- or three-dimensional case.
