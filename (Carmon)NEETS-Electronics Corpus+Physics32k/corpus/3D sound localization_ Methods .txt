There are many different methods of 3D sound localization. For instance:
Different types of sensor structure, such as microphone array and binaural hearing robot head.
Different techniques for optimal results, such as neural network, maximum likelihood and Multiple signal classification (MUSIC).
Real-time methods using an Acoustic Vector Sensor (AVS) array
Offline methods (according to timeliness)
Microphone Array Approach
