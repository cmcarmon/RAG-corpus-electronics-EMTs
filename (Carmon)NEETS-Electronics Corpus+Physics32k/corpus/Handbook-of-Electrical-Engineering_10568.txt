Color Rendering Index (CRI). 
In 1964 the CIE (Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage) ofﬁcially adopted
the IES procedure for rating lighting sources and developed the current standard by which light sources are
rated for their color rendering properties. The CRI is a numerical value for the color comparison of one light
source to that of a reference light source.
