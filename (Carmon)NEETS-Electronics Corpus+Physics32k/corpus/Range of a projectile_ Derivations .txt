A launch angle of 45 degrees displaces the projectile the farthest horizontally. This is due to the nature of right triangles. Additionally, from the equation for the range :




d
=




v

2


sin

2
θ

g




{\displaystyle d={\frac {v^{2}\sin 2\theta }{g}}}

We can see that the range will be maximum when the value of



sin

2
θ


{\displaystyle \sin 2\theta }
is the highest (i.e. when it is equal to 1). Clearly,



2
θ


{\displaystyle 2\theta }
has to be 90 degrees. That is to say,



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is 45 degrees.
