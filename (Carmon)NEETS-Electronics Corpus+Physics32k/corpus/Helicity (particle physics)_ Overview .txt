The angular momentum J → is the sum of an orbital momentum L → and a spin S →. The relationship between orbital momentum L →, the position operator r→ and the linear momentum p→ is

so L →'s component in the direction of p→ is zero. Thus, helicity is just the projection of the spin onto the direction of linear momentum. The helicity of a particle is right-handed if the direction of its spin is the same as the direction of its motion and left-handed if opposite. Helicity is conserved.
Because the eigenvalues of spin with respect to an axis have discrete values, the eigenvalues of helicity are also discrete. For a particle of spin S, the eigenvalues of helicity are S, S − 1, ..., −S. The measured helicity of a spin S particle will range from −S to +S.
For massless spin-​1⁄2 particles, helicity is equivalent to the chirality operator multiplied by ħ/2. By contrast, for massive particles, distinct chirality states (e.g., as occur in the weak interaction charges) have both positive and negative helicity components, in ratios proportional to the mass of the particle.
