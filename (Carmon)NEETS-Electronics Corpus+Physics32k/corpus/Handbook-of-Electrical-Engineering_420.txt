is an oriented graph such that the variable xj in S is represented by a node (also denoted by xj) in Gl, and the
coefﬁcient aij of the variable xj in S by a branch with a branch gain aij connected between nodes xi and xj in Gl
and directed from xj to xi . Furthermore, a source node is included in Gl such that for each constant bk in S there
is a node with gain bk in Gl from node 1 to node sk. Graph Gl0 is the subgraph of Gl obtained by deleting the
source node l and all the branches connected to it. Graph Gij is the subgraph of Gl obtained by ﬁrst removing
all the outgoing branches from node xj and then short-circuiting node l to node xj. A loop set l is a subgraph
of Gl0 that contains all the nodes of Gl0 with each node having exactly one incoming and one outgoing branch.
The product p of the gains of all the branches in l is called a loop-set product. A 2-loop-set I2 is a subgraph of
Glj containing all the nodes of Glj with each node having exactly one incoming and one outgoing branch. The
product p2 of the gains of all the branches in l2 is called a 2-loop-set product.
The modiﬁed Coates gain formula is now stated in the following theorem.
