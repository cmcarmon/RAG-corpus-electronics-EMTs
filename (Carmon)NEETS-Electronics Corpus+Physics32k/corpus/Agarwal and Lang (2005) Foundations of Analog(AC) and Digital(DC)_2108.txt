discussed in Example 7.21 in Chapter 7, or Example 8.3 in Chapter 8. This dif-
ferential input stage gives the Op Amp its high input resistance, and a high gain.
It also converts the differential input voltage to a single-ended output.1 Typical
Op Amps also have a second stage similar to the second stage in Example 7.21
in Chapter 7, which provides additional amplification and level shifts the output
voltage to zero when both inputs are equal. Op Amps may also have an output
stage similar to the buffer illustrated in Figure 8.40 in Chapter 8, which gives
the Op Amp its low output impedance.
