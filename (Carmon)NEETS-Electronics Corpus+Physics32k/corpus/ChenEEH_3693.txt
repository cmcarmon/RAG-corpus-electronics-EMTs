is a manifestation of the physics of the all-pole system in the
mathematics of the DT model. The set {ki}M
i¼1 contains equiva-
lent information to the set of LP coefﬁcients, as is evident from
the fact that the reﬂection coefﬁcients can be used to recon-
struct the speech from the error signal {^een}. The reﬂection
coefﬁcients are often used as alternatives to the LP parameters
in compression and coding schemes because of their desirable
numerical property of having a restricted dynamic range (in
theory), jkij < 1 for all i. (Deller et al., 2000). Checking the
reﬂection coefﬁcients for this property on an iteration-by-
iteration basis in the L-D recursion offers a convenient check
for numerical stability.
