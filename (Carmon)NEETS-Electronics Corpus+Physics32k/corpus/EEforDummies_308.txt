In this example, because the two resistors have equal resistance, connectÂ­
ing them in parallel results in an equivalent resistance of half the value of 
either one. The result is that each resistor draws half the supply current. If 
two resistors of unequal value are placed in parallel, more current will flow 
through the path with the lower resistance than the path with the higher 
resistance.
