Development of PV Cells
High-performance silicon solar cells are more widely available and lower in cost than other types of photovoltaic
devices. For this reason, they remain in consideration for a number of TPV prototype systems. As discussed,
choosing silicon for the PV converter places stringent requirements on other subsystems. TPV system design
can  take  one  of  two  paths  to  improve  on  Si-based  converters;  namely,  either  raise  the  emitter  temperature
(which will worsen thermal management problems) or seek PV devices with smaller bandgaps and commen-
surately  longer  wavelength  response.  During  the  early  phase  of  TPV  research,  only  Ge  cells  offered  a  longer
wavelength  response.  However,  the  intrinsic  carrier  concentration  of  germanium  is  too  high  for  this  device
technology ever to reach a high efÔ¨Åciency [8].
