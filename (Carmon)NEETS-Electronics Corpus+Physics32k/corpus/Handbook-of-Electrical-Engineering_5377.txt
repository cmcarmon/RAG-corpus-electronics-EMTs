Electricity grid-connected systems generally exist in two basic forms. Systems that immediately convert the
generated electricity from direct current (dc) to alternating current (ac) and synchronize this power with the
electricity grid are the most fundamental for safety reasons. These systems are designed to not supply electricity
to  the  grid  when  there  is  a  grid  power  outage.  The  most  complex  photovoltaic  systems  are  grid-connected
systems with storage â€” sometimes called uninterruptible power supplies. These systems disconnect from the
utility grid when there is a power outage but continue to provide electricity to the load. The load can often be
a  home,  commercial  building,  or  a  sensitive  load,  such  as  a  computer.  The  systems  include  the  ability  to
synchronize with the grid, the ability to provide electricity to the grid when the amount generated is greater
than the load, battery charging, and the conversion of dc to ac. A schematic of one of these systems is shown
in Fig. 60.17. All other systems can be derived from this complex system by removing components.
