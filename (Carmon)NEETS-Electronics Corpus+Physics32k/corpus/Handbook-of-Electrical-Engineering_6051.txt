• State estimator: Uses real-time status and analog measurements to determine the ‘‘best’’ estimate of the
state  of  the  power  system.  It  uses  a  redundant  set  of  measurements;  calculates  voltages,  phase  angles,
and power ﬂows for all components in the system; and reports overload conditions.
