Petri nets are a model-oriented formal method and are well
suited for modeling the dynamic behaviors of concurrent and
distributed systems. Petri net speciﬁcations reveal system design
structures and thus provide guidelines for system implementa-
tion. Furthermore, Petri net speciﬁcations are executable and
support system simulation and testing in addition to formal
analysis. It is not easy, however, to directly and explicitly express
behavioral properties using Petri nets. On the other hand, prop-
erty-oriented formal methods, such as temporal logic, are ideal
for specifying and analyzing behavioral properties. It would be
great to have a hybrid formal method by integrating the
strengths of model-oriented and property-oriented formal
methods. In recent years,
integrating formal methods has
become a major research area (Clarke and Wing, 1996). There
have been several published results on integrating Petri nets and
temporal logic (Anttila et al., 1983; Diaz et al., 1983; He and Lee,
1990; He, 1992; Mandrioli et al., 1996; Suzuki and Lu, 1989).
Most of the earlier work was either lacking a systematic approach
or using a low-level Petri net model. In the following subsec-
tions, we describe our results on integrating predicate transition
nets (Genrich and Lautenbach, 1981) and ﬁrst-order linear time
temporal logic (Manna and Pnueli, 1992).
