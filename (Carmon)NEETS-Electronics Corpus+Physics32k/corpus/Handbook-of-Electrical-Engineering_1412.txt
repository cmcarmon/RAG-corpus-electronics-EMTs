Autoregressive model:
Classiﬁer: Maps signal utterances into a ﬁnite set of word units, e.g., syllables.
Encoder: Maps signal vectors into a ﬁnite set of codewords. A vector quantizer is a particular type of encoder.
Hidden Markov model:
Statistical model comprised of several subsources controlled by Markovian process.
Intelligibility: Objective quantitative measure of speech perception.
Noise: Any interfering signal adversely affecting the communication of the clean signal.
Quality:
Signal: Clean speech sample to be communicated with human or machine.
Signal-to-noise ratio: Ratio of the signal power to the noise power measured in decibels.
Speech enhancement:
