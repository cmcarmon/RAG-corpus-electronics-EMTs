Now, let’s add A or B and a carry-in. For example, let’s assume that A is HIGH and B is LOW. With
these conditions, gate 1 will have an output. This output and the carry-in applied to gates 3 and 4 will
produce a sum out of 0 and a carry of 1. This carry from gate 4 will cause gate 5 to produce a carry-out.
The sum of A and a carry (12 plus 12) is 102.
