While Oersted’s surprising discovery of electromagnetism paved the way for more practical ap-
plications of electricity, it was Michael Faraday who gave us the key to the practical generation
of electricity: electromagnetic induction. Faraday discovered that a voltage would be gener-
ated across a length of wire if that wire was exposed to a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux of
changing intensity.
