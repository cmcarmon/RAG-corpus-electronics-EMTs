partitioned from the network that carries the user trafÔ¨Åc. This principle is incorporated into the concept of
integrated services digital networks (ISDNs), which is described thoroughly in Helgert [1991]. The basic idea
of ISDN is to offer to the user some number of 64-kbps access lines plus a 16-kbps access line through which
the user can describe to an ISDN how the user wishes to use each of the 64-kbps circuits at any given time.
The channels formed by concatenating the access lines with the network interswitch trunks having the requested
characteristics are established using an out-of-band signaling system, the most modern of which is signaling
system #7 (SS#7).
