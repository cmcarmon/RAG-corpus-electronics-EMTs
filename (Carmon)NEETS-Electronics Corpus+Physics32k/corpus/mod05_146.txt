current flowing through it from an external source. This current causes a magnetic field to be produced. 
This field is indicated by the dotted line through the loops. The loop (armature) field is both attracted and 
repelled by the field from the field poles. Since the current through the loop goes around in the direction 
of the arrows, the north pole of the armature is at the upper left, and the south pole of the armature is at 
the lower right, as shown in figure 2-2, (view A). Of course, as the loop (armature) turns, these magnetic 
poles turn with it. Now, as shown in the illustrations, the north armature pole is repelled from the north 
field pole and attracted to the right by the south field pole. Likewise, the south armature pole is repelled 
from the south field pole and is attracted to the left by the north field pole. This action causes the armature 
to turn in a clockwise direction, as shown in figure 2-2 (view B).
