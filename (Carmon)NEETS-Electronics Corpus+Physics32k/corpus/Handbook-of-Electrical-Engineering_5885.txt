References on synchronous generators are numerous because of the historical importance of these machines
in large-scale electric energy production. [Sarma, 1979] includes a derivation of the steady-state and dynamic
models,  dynamic  performance,  excitation,  and  trends  in  development  of  large  generators.  [Chapman,  1991]
