The circuit of Fig. 64.3 is a reÔ¨Ånement on that of Fig. 64.2(c). The values R1, R2, R3, X1, X2, X3 are all small
(less than 0.05 per-unit) and Rc, Xm, large (greater than 10 per-unit). The circuit of Fig. 64.3 requires that all
values be in per-unit. Circuit data are available from the manufacturer or obtained from conventional tests. It
must be noted that although the circuit of Fig. 64.3 is commonly used, it is not rigorously correct because it
does not properly account for the mutual couplings between windings.
