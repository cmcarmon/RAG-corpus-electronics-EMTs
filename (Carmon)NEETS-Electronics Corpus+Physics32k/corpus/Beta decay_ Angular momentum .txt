For allowed decays, the net orbital angular momentum is zero, hence only spin quantum numbers are considered.
The electron and antineutrino are fermions, spin-1/2 objects, therefore they may couple to total



S
=
1


{\displaystyle S=1}
(parallel) or



S
=
0


{\displaystyle S=0}
(anti-parallel).
For forbidden decays, orbital angular momentum must also be taken into consideration.
