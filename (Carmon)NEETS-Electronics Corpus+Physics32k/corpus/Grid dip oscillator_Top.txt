"Dipmeter" could also refer to an influential early commercial expert system called Dipmeter Advisor; or may refer to an instrument that measures the "dip angle" of the planet's magnetic field, the field line angle in a vertical plane.

Grid dip oscillator (GDO), also called grid dip meter, dip meter, dipmeter, or just dipper, is a measuring instrument to measure resonant frequency of radio frequency circuits. It measures the amount of absorption of a high frequency inductively coupled magnetic field by nearby objects. It is an oscillator whose amplitude changes when near a resonant circuit which is tuned to the frequency the oscillator generates. At the heart of the instrument is a tunable LC circuit with a coil that serves as a loose inductive coupling to the measured LC resonant circuit. Resonance is indicated by a dip in the meter indicator on the device, usually based on a microammeter.
