The switch is normally off and behaves like an open circuit. When pressure
is applied to the switch, it closes and behaves like a wire and conducts current.
Accordingly, the switch can be modeled as the three-terminal device shown in
Figure 6.2. The three terminals include a control terminal, an input terminal,
and an output terminal. The input and output terminals of a switch commonly
exhibit symmetric properties. When the control terminal has a TRUE or a
logical 1 signal on it, the input is connected to the output through a short
circuit, and the switch is said to be in its ON state. Otherwise, there is an open
