When the wavelength of 700 millimicrons is measured in a medium such as air, it produces the color
red, but the same wave measured in a different medium will have a different wavelength. When red light
which has been traveling in air enters glass, it loses speed. Its wavelength becomes shorter or compressed,
but it continues to be red. This illustrates that the color of light depends on frequency and not on
wavelength. The color scale in figure 1-18 is based on the wavelengths in air.
