Despite the misleading name, the free-space path loss formula inherits two important effects from the Friis Transmission Formula:
Intensity (



I


{\displaystyle I}
) - the power density due to path loss by spreading of the electromagnetic energy yielding loss proportional to the square of distance;
Antenna Capture Area (




A

e
f
f




{\displaystyle A_{eff}}
) - the capability of the receiving antenna to capture electromagnetic energy yielding loss inversely proportional to the square of wavelength or proportional to the square of frequency.
Hence the equation for FSPL is:

Friis implied the antennas are isotropic. Hence the power density



I


{\displaystyle I}
from the isotropic transmit antenna vs. distance from the antenna



d


{\displaystyle d}
is...

The effective area of the isotropic antenna is...

Combining the two yields...
