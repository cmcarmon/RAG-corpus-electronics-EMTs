Solution 
 
Once  again,  the  reactance  of  the  capacitor,  C1,  is 
3.18  G (see  Example  6.2). The  reactance  of  L1 at 
50 Hz can be calculated from: 
 
XL = 2I f L = 2 × 3.14 × 50 × 10 = 3,140 G
The  amount  of  ripple  at  the  output  of  the  circuit 
(i.e.  appearing  across  C1)  will  be  approximately 
given by:
