Having computed all the currents and voltages of figure 3-54, a complete description of the
operation of the circuit can be made. The total current of 3 amps leaves the negative terminal of the
battery and flows through the 8-ohm resistor (R1). In so doing, a voltage drop of 24 volts occurs across
resistor R1. At point A, this 3-ampere current divides into two currents. Of the total current, 1.8 amps
flows through the 20-ohm resistor. The remaining current of 1.2 amps flows from point A, down through
the 30-ohm resistor to point B. This current produces a voltage drop of 36 volts across the 30-ohm
resistor. (Notice that the voltage drops across the 20- and 30-ohm resistors are the same.) The two branch
currents of 1.8 and 1.2 amps combine at junction B and the total current of 3 amps flows back to the
source. The action of the circuit has been completely described with the exception of power consumed,
which could be described using the values previously computed.
