Effects similar to those described in the preceding paragraph can be produced at the transmitting 
point itself. Consider the antennas shown in figure 4-21, views A and B. View A shows an unobstructed 
view of the radiation pattern of a single dipole. In view B two dipoles, shown as points 1 and 2, are 
perpendicular to the plane of the page. They are spaced 1/4 wavelength apart at the operating frequency. 
The radiation pattern from either antenna 1 or 2, operating alone, would be uniform in all directions in 
this plane, as shown in view A. Suppose that current is being fed to both antennas from the same 
transmitter in such a way that the current fed to antenna 2 lags the current in antenna 1 by 90 degrees. 
Energy radiating from antenna 1 toward receiving location X will reach antenna 2 after 1/4 cycle of 
operation. The energy from both antennas will add, and propagation toward X will be strong.
