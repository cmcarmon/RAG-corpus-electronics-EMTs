De Motu Antiquiora ("The Older Writings on Motion"), or simply De Motu, is Galileo Galilei's early written work on motion. It was written largely between 1589 and 1592, but was not published until 1687, after his death. It was never published during his lifetime due to a few uncertainties in his mathematics and certain parts of his understanding. Because it was never published during his life, he never composed a final draft. In the last parts of his work, the writing style changes from an essay to a dialogue between two people who strongly uphold his views.
By writing this book in the 16th century, Galileo was on the forefront of investigating the motion of falling bodies. In De Motu, he openly rejects Aristotle's views on the physics of motion and his astronomical views. Galileo opposes him with not only his opinion but his facts he has obtained based on experiment and observation of celestial bodies.
It is unclear whether or not this book was initially made out to be a book in the form of dialogue or in more conventional way of writing. The reason for this is that Galileo worked on this book for many years, creating multiple copies of each section. The version of this book that we have today is a compilation of the best versions of his work in one. Some of these forms are in dialogue between the two men and other parts are in regular text.
