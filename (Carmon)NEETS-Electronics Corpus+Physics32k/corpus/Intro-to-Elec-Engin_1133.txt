Torque-Speed Characteristics of 3-Phase Induction Motors
Because the torqueâ€“slip characteristic is one of the most important aspects of the induction motor,
we will now develop an expression for torque as a function of slip and other equivalent circuit
parameters. Recalling Equation (13.2.8) and the equivalent circuit of Figure 13.2.6, we will obtain
