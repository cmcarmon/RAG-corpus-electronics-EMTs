Increased coupling effect between interconnects in ultra deep
submicron technology not only aggravates the power-delay
metrics but also deteriorates the signal integrity due to capaci-
tive and inductive cross talk noises. Conventional approaches
to interconnect synthesis are aimed at optimal interconnect
structures in terms of interconnect topology, wire width and
spacing, and buffer location and sizes (Cong, 1999).
