The temperature that enters in the denominator of the integrand in the Clausius inequality is actually the temperature of the external reservoir with which the system exchanges heat. At each instant of the process, the system is in contact with an external reservoir.
Because of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in each infinitesimal heat exchange process between the system and the reservoir, the net change in entropy of the "universe", so to say,is,

in this step to be positive, the temperature of the "hot" reservoir

needs to be slightly greater than the temperature of the system at that instant. If the temperature of the system is given by

{\displaystyle T_{Cold}\leq T_{2}}
) in an infinitesimal step, then again, for the Second Law of Thermodynamics to hold, we would have, in an exactly similar manner:

Here, the amount of heat 'absorbed' by the system is given by



δ

{\displaystyle \delta Q_{2}}
(

{\displaystyle \leq 0}
), signifying that heat is transferring from the system to the reservoir, with

Since the total change in entropy for the system is 0 in a cyclic process, if we add all the infinitesimal steps of heat intake and heat expulsion from the reservoir, signified by the previous two equations, with the temperature of the reservoir at each instant given by

{\displaystyle T}
, we would have,

In particular.

Hence, we proved the Clausius Theorem.
We summarize the following, (the inequality in the third statement below, being obviously guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics,which is the basis of our calculation),

Thus, the Clausius inequality is a consequence of applying the second law of thermodynamics at each infinitesimal stage of heat transfer, and is thus in a sense a weaker condition than the Second Law itself.
