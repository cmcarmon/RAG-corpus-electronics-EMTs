Back in the early days of electrical measurement technology, a special type of battery known
as a mercury standard cell was popularly used as a voltage calibration standard. The output
of a mercury cell was 1.0183 to 1.0194 volts DC (depending on the speciÔ¨Åc design of cell), and
was extremely stable over time. Advertised drift was around 0.004 percent of rated voltage per
year. Mercury standard cells were sometimes known as Weston cells or cadmium cells.
