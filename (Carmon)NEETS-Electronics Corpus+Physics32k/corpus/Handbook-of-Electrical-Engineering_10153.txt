Computed Torque Methods
Several control algorithms that incorporate dynamics have been developed. Many of these are variations of the
computed  torque  method,  which  is  similar  to  the  feedback  linearization  method  used  for  the  control  of
nonlinear  systems  [Spong  and Vidyasagar,  1989].  In  the  computed  torque  method  shown  in  Fig. 101.16,  the
required input forces or torques are computed as follows:
