had traces on only one side. Today, printed circuit 
boards have traces on both sides and are referred to 
as double-sided PCB. Complex boards may have four 
or more trace layers, with each layer insulated from the 
other by board  material. Special multilayer PCB may 
have eight or more trace layers. This chapter  focuses 
on how simple single and double-sided printed circuit 
boards are fabricated.
