Control systems inﬂuence our everyday lives just as much as some of the other areas of
electrical engineering. Examples abound in practice: household appliances, manufacturing and
processing plants, and navigational and guidance systems, in which concepts of the analysis
and design of control systems are utilized. A control system, in general, can be viewed as an
interconnection of components—electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, thermal, etc.—so as to obtain
a desired function in an efﬁcient and accurate manner. The control engineer is concerned with
the control of industrial processes and systems. The concepts of control engineering are not
limited to any particular branch of engineering. Hence, a basic understanding of control theory
