The technique used in time-domain reflectometry consists of feeding an impulse of energy into the 
system and then observing that energy as it is reflected by the system at the point of insertion. When the 
fast-rise input pulse meets with a discontinuity or impedance mismatch, the resultant reflections appearing 
at the feed point are compared in phase, time, and amplitude with the original pulse. By analyzing the 
magnitude, deviation, and shape of the reflected waveform, you can determine the nature of the 
impedance variation in the transmission system. Also, since distance is related to time and the amplitude 
of the reflected step is directly related to impedance, the comparison indicates the distance to the fault as 
well as the nature of the fault. Figure 5-25, view A, view B, view C, and view D, illustrates typical 
transmission line problems that can easily be identified by using a time-domain reflectometer (tdr). In 
addition to showing both the distance to and the nature (resistive, inductive, or capacitive) of each line 
discontinuity, time-domain reflectometry also reveals the characteristic impedance of the line and 
indicates whether losses are shunt or series. They are also used to locate and analyze connectors and 
splices.
