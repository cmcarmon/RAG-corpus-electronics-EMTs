With Wei-Xing Zhou, he has introduced the "thermal optimal path" method as a novel method to quantify the dynamical evolution of lead-lag structures between two time series. The method consists of constructing a distance matrix based on the matching of all sample data pairs between the two time series, as in recurrence plots. Then, the lagâ€“lead structure is searched for as the optimal path in the distance matrix landscape that minimizes the total mismatch between the two time series, and that obeys a one-to-one causal matching condition. The problem is solved mathematically by transfer matrix techniques, matching the TOP method to the problem of random directed polymers interacting with random substrates. Applications include the study of the relationships between inflation, inflation change, GDP growth rate and unemployment rate, volatilities of the US inflation rate versus economic growth rates, the US stock market versus the Federal funds rate and Treasury bond yields and the UK and US real-estate versus monetary policies.
A recent improvement of TOP has been introduced, called TOPS (symmetric thermal optimal path), which complement TOP by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant with respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This means that, if 'X comes before Y', this transforms into 'Y comes before X' under a time reversal. The TOPS approach stresses the importance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of information or policies may have drastically different impacts and developments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical conditions.
