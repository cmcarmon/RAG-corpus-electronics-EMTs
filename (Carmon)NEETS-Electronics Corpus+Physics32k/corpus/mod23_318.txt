A recorder’s FREQUENCY-RESPONSE specification is sometimes called its bandwidth. It tells
the range of frequencies a recorder can effectively record and reproduce. Factors that can degrade a
recorder’s frequency response are an improper bias level setting, reproduce head gap, or tape transport
speed. Also, failure to clean the heads and the tape transport can cause poor tape-to-head contact.
