In contrast to the inductive reactance, this equation indicates that the CAPACITIVE REACTANCE 
VARIES INVERSELY WITH THE FREQUENCY. When f = 0, XC is infinite (âˆž) and decreases as 
frequency increases. That is, the lower the frequency, the greater the capacitive reactance; the higher the 
frequency, the less the reactance for a given capacitor.
