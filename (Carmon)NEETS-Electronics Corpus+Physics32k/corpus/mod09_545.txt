PARALLEL-NEGATIVE LIMITER WITH BIAS.—The circuit shown in figure 4-13, view (A), 
is a parallel-negative limiter with negative bias. With no input, the battery maintains D1 in a reverse-bias 
condition. D1 cannot conduct until its cathode is more negative than its anode. D1 acts as an open until 
the input signal dips below −4 volts at T2 in view (B). At T2 the input signal becomes negative enough to 
forward bias the diode, D1 conducts and acts like a short, and the output is limited to the −4 volts from 
the battery from T2 to T3. Between T3 and T4 the diode is again reverse biased. The output signal 
follows the input signal and no limiting occurs.
