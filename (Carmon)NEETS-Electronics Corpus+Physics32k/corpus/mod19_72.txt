TWO RESCUER TECHNIQUE.Â—If two people trained in CPR are on the scene, one must 
perform compressions while the other performs artificial ventilation. The ratio for two-person CPR is 5 
compressions to 1 ventilation. One rescuer is positioned at the chest area and the other beside the victim's 
head. The rescuers should be on opposite sides of the victim.
