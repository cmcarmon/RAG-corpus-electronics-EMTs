The generic timescale can be used as a workaround for
simulators that do not allow to change the resolution limit
for the type time. Simulations based on femtoseconds reduce
the guaranteed simulation time to 2:14 ms—typical application
employments are several hours or even days. This requires
range extensions beyond 231 or changing the resolution limit
to milliseconds. If both are not feasible, a timescale to shrink
the simulation’s duration may be used.
