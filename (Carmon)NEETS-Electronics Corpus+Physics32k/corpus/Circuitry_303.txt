Bi-phase rectifier circuits 
 
Figure  6.10  shows  a  simple  bi-phase  rectifier 
circuit.  Mains  voltage  (240  V)  is  applied  to  the 
primary of  step-down transformer (T1) which has 
two  identical  secondary  windings,  each  providing 
12  V  r.m.s.  (the  turns  ratio  of  T1  will  thus  be 
240/12 or 20:1 for each secondary winding).  
  On positive half-cycles, point A will be positive 
with respect to point B. Similarly, point B will be
