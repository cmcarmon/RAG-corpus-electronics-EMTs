3. Once the bus voltage V has been computed from equa-
tion 7.39, the bus voltage phase angle d can be com-
puted from equation 7.37. Then, the line current
phasor I can be solved from equation 7.35. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
we would like to ensure that the magnitude of the line
current I stays below the thermal limit of the transmis-
sion line for preventing potential damage to the expen-
sive transmission line.
