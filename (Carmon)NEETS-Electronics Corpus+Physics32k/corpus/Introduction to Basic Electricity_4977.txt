For high-speed or high-precision designs, more 
than two layers are used to improve performance. 
With four trace layers, the two middle ones are usually 
power and ground. This evens out the flow of power 
and reduces voltage fluctuations at different points 
on the printed circuit board. The ground plane layer 
provides controlled impedance for high-speed signals. 
The close proximity of the ground and power planes 
also acts as a capacitor to reduce noise. One problem 
with multilayer printed circuit boards is the reliability 
of connections between the layers. It is sometimes dif-
ficult to detect which layer is defective.
