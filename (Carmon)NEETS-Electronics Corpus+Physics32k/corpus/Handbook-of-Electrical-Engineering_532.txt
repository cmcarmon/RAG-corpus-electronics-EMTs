may also make one diode type more desirable than another. Schottky diodes conduct current with one type of
charge carrier and are therefore inherently faster to turn off than bipolar diodes. However, one of the limitations
of Schottky diodes is their excessive forward voltage drop when designed to support reverse biases above about
200 V. Therefore, high-voltage diodes are the
