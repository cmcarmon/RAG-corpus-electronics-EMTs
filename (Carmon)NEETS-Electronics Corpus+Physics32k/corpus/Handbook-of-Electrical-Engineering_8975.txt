The window area ranges from 4 to 5 in. in width by 0.5 in. in height
and may be moved through 14 to 20 in., so that a fairly large area may
be covered in a single manual scan. Images wider than the maximum
window may be scanned in two passes, and the OCR software can stitch
the  two  scans  together  into  a  single  image,  although  this  procedure
requires considerable care in scanning so that the scans line up properly.
Therefore, when images wider than the window of the hand-held scan-
ner are to be scanned, it is advisable to use a ï¬‚atbed scanner of the type
shown in Fig. 89.19 which can handle a full 8.5 in. by 11 in. page, or
some of the larger scanners than can accept large drawings and input
them into the computer system. Resolutions of 400 dpi and higher, with
up  to  250  levels  of  gray  and  24  bits  of  color  resolution  are  available.
Thus, scanners offer a wide variety of choice and performance capabil-
ities, and are powerful input devices when prepared data in visual form
is to be entered into the computer system.
