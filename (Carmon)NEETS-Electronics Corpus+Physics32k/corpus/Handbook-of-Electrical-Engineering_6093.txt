Not all software is run on PCs. Apart from the Macintosh, which has a similar capability to a PC but which
is less popular with engineers, more powerful workstations are available usually based on the Unix operating
system. Mini computers and mainframe computers are also still in general use in universities and industry even
though it had been thought that they would be totally superseded.
