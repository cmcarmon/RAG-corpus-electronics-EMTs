West Africa Time, or WAT, is a time zone used in west-central Africa; with countries west of Benin instead using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT; equivalent to UTC with no offset). West Africa Time is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC+01), which makes it the same as Central European Time (CET) during winter, or Western European Summer Time (WEST) and British Summer Time (BST) during the summer.
As most of this time zone is in the equatorial and tropical region, there is little change in day length throughout the year, so daylight saving time is not observed.
West Africa Time is used by the following countries:
Algeria (as Central European Time)
Angola
Chad
Cameroon
Central African Republic
Democratic Republic of the Congo (western side only)
Equatorial Guinea
Gabon
Niger
Nigeria
Republic of the Congo
São Tomé and Príncipe
Tunisia (as Central European Time)
