For a continuous charge distribution in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:

)





{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} \mathbf {F} =\mathrm {d} q\left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right)\,\!}

where dF is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge dq. If both sides of this equation are divided by the volume of this small piece of the charge distribution dV, the result is:





f

=
ρ

(


E

+

v

×

B


)





{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =\rho \left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right)\,\!}

where f is the force density (force per unit volume) and ρ is the charge density (charge per unit volume). Next, the current density corresponding to the motion of the charge continuum is





J

=
ρ

v





{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\rho \mathbf {v} \,\!}

so the continuous analogue to the equation is

The total force is the volume integral over the charge distribution:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\iiint \!(\rho \mathbf {E} +\mathbf {J} \times \mathbf {B} )\,\mathrm {d} V.\,\!}

By eliminating ρ and J, using Maxwell's equations, and manipulating using the theorems of vector calculus, this form of the equation can be used to derive the Maxwell stress tensor σ, in turn this can be combined with the Poynting vector S to obtain the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor T used in general relativity.
In terms of σ and S, another way to write the Lorentz force (per unit volume) is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} =\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}-{\dfrac {1}{c^{2}}}{\dfrac {\partial \mathbf {S} }{\partial t}}\,\!}

where c is the speed of light and ∇· denotes the divergence of a tensor field. Rather than the amount of charge and its velocity in electric and magnetic fields, this equation relates the energy flux (flow of energy per unit time per unit distance) in the fields to the force exerted on a charge distribution. See Covariant formulation of classical electromagnetism for more details.
The density of power associated with the Lorentz force in a material medium is





J

⋅

E



{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} \cdot \mathbf {E} }
.
If we separate the total charge and total current into their free and bound parts, we get that the density of the Lorentz force is

.
where: ρf is the density of free charge; P is the polarization density; Jf is the density of free current; and M is the magnetization density. In this way, the Lorentz force can explain the torque applied to a permanent magnet by the magnetic field. The density of the associated power is
