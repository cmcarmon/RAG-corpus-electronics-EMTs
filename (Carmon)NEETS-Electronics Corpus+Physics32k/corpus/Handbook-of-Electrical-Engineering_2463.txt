of the actual Q point due to the inevitable variations in device and component characteristics and values. This
safety margin should keep the Q point well away from the extreme limits of the active region, and thus ensure
operation of the JFET in the active region under most conditions. If IDSS = +10 mA, then a good choice for the
Q point would thus be around +5.0 mA. If VP = â€“4 V, then
