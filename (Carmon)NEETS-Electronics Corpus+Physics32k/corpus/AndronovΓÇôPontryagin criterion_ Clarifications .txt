Orbital topological stability of a dynamical system means that for any sufficiently small perturbation (in the C1-metric), there exists a homeomorphism close to the identity map which transforms the orbits of the original dynamical system to the orbits of the perturbed system (cf structural stability).
The first condition of the theorem is known as global hyperbolicity. A zero of a vector field v, i.e. a point x0 where v(x0)=0, is said to be hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues of the linearization of v at x0 is purely imaginary. A periodic orbit of a flow is said to be hyperbolic if none of the eigenvalues of the Poincar√© return map at a point on the orbit has absolute value one.
Finally, saddle connection refers to a situation where an orbit from one saddle point enters the same or another saddle point, i.e. the unstable and stable separatrices are connected (cf homoclinic orbit and heteroclinic orbit).
