For reverse voltage slightly higher than breakdown, the avalanche effect releases an almost unlimited 
number of carriers so that the diode essentially becomes a short circuit. The current flow in this region is 
limited only by an external series current-limiting resistor. Operating a diode in the breakdown region 
does not damage it, as long as the maximum power dissipation rating of the diode is not exceeded. 
Removing the reverse voltage permits all carriers to return to their normal energy values and velocities.
