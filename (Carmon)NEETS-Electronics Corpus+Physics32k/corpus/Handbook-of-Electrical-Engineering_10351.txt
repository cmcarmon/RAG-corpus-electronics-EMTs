A video uplink consists of a video exciter, HPA, antenna, and optionally an encryption system such as B-MAC
(multiplexed analog component, version B) encoder, for business video broadcasts. Each remote VSAT must
be conÔ¨Ågured to receive the video transmission. This involves adding a video receiver at each VSAT location
that plugs into the VSAT IDU. Audio/video signals from the video receiver can be presented directly or through
a B-MAC decoder to a standard TV monitor.
