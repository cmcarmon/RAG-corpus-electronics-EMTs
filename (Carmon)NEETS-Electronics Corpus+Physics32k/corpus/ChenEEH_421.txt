Apart from minor differences having to do largely with IC
implementation, active ﬁlter design with OTAs is the same as
ﬁlter design with op-amps. As before, we have available the
cascade method with ﬁrst and second-order sections, or we
can use ladder simulations. For the latter, it can be shown that
element replacement and the signal ﬂow-graph technique lead
to identical OTA-C ﬁlter structures, so only one of the two
methods needs to be addressed.
