Trade-offs between fast transit times and low capacitance are necessary for high-speed response.
However, any change in photodiode parameters to optimize the transit time and capacitance can also
affect responsivity, dark current, and coupling efficiency. A fast transit time requires a thin detector active
area, while low capacitance and high responsivity require a thick active region. The diameter of the
detector active area can also be minimized. This reduces the detector dark current and minimizes junction
capacitance. However, a minimum limit on this active area exists to provide for efficient fiber-to-detector
coupling.
