normally constructed from discrete components (individual resistors and transistors). Some circuits are
manufactured as integrated circuits and packaged in modified transistor outline (TO) packages, as shown
in figure 3-35. An in-depth coverage of circuit packaging can be found in NEETS, Module 14,
Introduction to Microelectronics.
