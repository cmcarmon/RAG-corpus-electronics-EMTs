The insulated-gate FET, also known as a metal oxide semiconductor ﬁeld eﬀect transistor
(MOSFET), is similar to the JFET but exhibits an even larger resistive input impedance due
to the thin layer of silicon dioxide that is used to insulate the gate from the semiconductor
channel. This insulating layer forms a capacitive coupling between the gate and the body
of the transistor. The consequent lack of an internal DC connection to the gate makes the
device more versatile than the JFET, but it also means that the insulating material of the
capacitor can be easily damaged by the internal discharge of static charge developed during
normal handling.
