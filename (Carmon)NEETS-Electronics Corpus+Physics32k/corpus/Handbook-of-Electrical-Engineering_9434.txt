 is one in which the original infor-
mation is appended with new information to form the code word, thus allowing the decoding process to consist
of simply removing the additional information and keeping the original data. In other words, the original data
is obtained from the code word by stripping away extra bits, called the code bits or check bits, and retaining
does  not  possess  the  property  of
only  those  associated  with  the  original  information.  A 
separability and, consequently, requires more complicated decoding procedures.
