Aerial gain 
 
The  field  strength  produced  by  an  aerial  is 
proportional to the amount of current flowing in it. 
However,  since  different  types  of  aerial  produce 
different  values  of  field  strength  for  the  same 
applied RF power level, we attribute a power gain 
to  the  aerial.  This  power  gain  is  specified  in 
relation  to  a  reference  aerial  and  it  is  usually 
specified in decibels (dB)â€”see Appendix 5.
