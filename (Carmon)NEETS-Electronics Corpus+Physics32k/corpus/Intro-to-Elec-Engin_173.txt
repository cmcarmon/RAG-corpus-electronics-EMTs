Mesh-Current Method
This complements the nodal-voltage method of circuit analysis. A set of independent mesh-
current variables that implicitly satisfy the KCL equations is selected in order to formulate circuit
equations in this mesh analysis. An elementary loop, or a mesh, is easily identiﬁed as one of
the “window panes” of the whole circuit. However, it must be noted that not all circuits can be
laid out to contain only meshes as in the case of planar networks. Those which cannot are called
nonplanar circuits, for which the mesh analysis cannot be applied, but the nodal analysis can be
employed.
