In mathematics, a rigid transformation or Euclidean isometry of a Euclidean space preserves distances between every pair of points. Rigid transformations of the plane R2, space R3, or real n-dimensional space Rn are termed a Euclidean transformation because they form the basis of Euclidean geometry.
The rigid transformations include rotations, translations, reflections, or their combination. Sometimes reflections are excluded from the definition of a rigid transformation by imposing that the transformation also preserve the handedness of figures in the Euclidean space (a reflection would not preserve handedness; for instance, it would transform a left hand into a right hand). To avoid ambiguity, this smaller class of transformations is known as proper rigid transformations (informally, also known as roto-translations). In general, any proper rigid transformation can be decomposed as a rotation followed by a translation, while any rigid transformation can be decomposed as an improper rotation followed by a translation (or as a sequence of reflections).
Any object will keep the same shape and size after a proper rigid transformation.
All rigid transformations are examples of affine transformations. The set of all (proper and improper) rigid transformations is a group called the Euclidean group, denoted E(n) for n-dimensional Euclidean spaces. The set of proper rigid transformation is called special Euclidean group, denoted SE(n).
In kinematics, proper rigid transformations in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space, denoted SE(3), are used to represent the linear and angular displacement of rigid bodies. According to Chasles' theorem, every rigid transformation can be expressed as a screw displacement.
