New York City, for example, had been drawing about 300 MW from the network just before
the failure. Loss of the upstate plants caused a sudden reversal of ï¬‚ow and placed a heavy drain
on the City generators. The load was much greater than the plants still in service could supply,
and the result was a complete collapse. Automatic equipment shut down the units to protect them
from damage.
