The transactions and journals of the IEEE may be classiﬁed into broad categories of devices,
circuits, electronics, computers, systems, and interdisciplinary areas. All areas of electrical
engineering require a working knowledge of physics and mathematics, as well as engineering
methodologies and supporting skills in communications and human relations. A closely related
ﬁeld is that of computer science.
