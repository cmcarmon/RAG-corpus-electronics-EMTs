An air or water mass moving with speed



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
subject only to the Coriolis force travels in a circular trajectory called an 'inertial circle'. Since the force is directed at right angles to the motion of the particle, it moves with a constant speed around a circle whose radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
is given by:

{\displaystyle R={\frac {v}{f}}\,}

where



f


{\displaystyle f}

. The Coriolis parameter typically has a mid-latitude value of about 10−4 s−1; hence for a typical atmospheric speed of 10 m/s (22 mph) the radius is 100 km (62 mi), with a period of about 17 hours. For an ocean current with a typical speed of 10 cm/s (0.22 mph), the radius of an inertial circle is 1 km (0.6 mi). These inertial circles are clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere (where trajectories are bent to the right) and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
If the rotating system is a parabolic turntable, then



f


{\displaystyle f}
is constant and the trajectories are exact circles. On a rotating planet,



f


{\displaystyle f}
varies with latitude and the paths of particles do not form exact circles. Since the parameter



f


{\displaystyle f}
varies as the sine of the latitude, the radius of the oscillations associated with a given speed are smallest at the poles (latitude = ±90°), and increase toward the equator.
