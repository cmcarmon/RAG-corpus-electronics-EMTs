The same set of ideal two-terminal elements serve to build either informa-
tion processing or energy processing systems as well. Information and energy
processing includes the communication, storage, or transformation of informa-
tion or energy, and is a second major motivation for studying electronic circuits.
Whether we are interested in modeling systems or in information and energy
processing, it is essential to be able to represent five basic processes in terms of
our lumped circuit abstraction.
