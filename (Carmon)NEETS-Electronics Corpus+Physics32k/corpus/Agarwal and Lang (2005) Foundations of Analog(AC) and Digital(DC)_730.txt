Furthermore, recall that Disco’s systems operate under a static discipline with the
following voltage thresholds: VIL = 2 V, VIH = 3.5 V, VOL = 1.5 V, and VOH = 4 V.
The Yikes development team first looks at the output voltage levels required by Disco’s
static discipline. They observe that the 4.5-V output produced by their new adders falls
within Disco’s legitimate range for a logical 1 (between VOH = 4 V and 5 V), thus
satisfying the VOH requirement.
