Because community psychologists often work on social issues, they are often working toward positive social change. Watzlawick, et al. (1974) differentiated between first-order and second-order change and how second-order change is often the focus of community psychology.
first-order change: positively changing the individuals in a setting to attempt to fix a problem
second-order change: Attending to systems and structures involved with the problem to adjust the personâ€“environment fit
As an example of how these methods differ, consider homelessness. A first-order change to "fix" homelessness would be to offer shelter to one or many homeless people. A second-order change would be to address issues in policy regarding affordable housing.
