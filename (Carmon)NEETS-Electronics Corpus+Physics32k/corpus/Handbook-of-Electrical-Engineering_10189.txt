The planning and engineering of a robot installation must address many issues, including the operational
methods  to  be  employed,  workcell  design  and  its  control,  the  choice  or  design  of  end  effectors  and  other
ﬁxturing  and  tooling  requirements,  and  sensory  and  programming  requirements.  In  addition,  one  needs  to
focus on safety considerations for the workcell as well as overall systems integration. Computer-aided design
(CAD) is very helpful to study potential machine interference and various layout problems as well as estimating
various performance parameters. Various commercial CAD software packages exist to analyze such problems.
One such example is McAuto’s PLACE System. The study at this stage should consider the basic purpose and
function of the planned workcell. Consideration needs to be given to analyzing the cycle time that is basic to
determining the production rate. An approach developed by Nof and Lechtman [1982], called Robot Time and
Motion (RTM), is useful for analyzing the cycle time of robots.
