▶✓ A spring‐loaded plunger‐style pump: To use a spring‐loaded pump, you 
depress the plunger and position the nozzle over the joint that you want 
to remove. Then you carefully position the soldering iron tip into the 
joint to heat the solder, avoiding contact with the end of the pump. As 
the solder begins to flow, you release the plunger to suck up the solder. 
Finally, you expel the solder from the pump (into a waste receptacle) by 
depressing the plunger one more time. Repeat these steps as needed to 
remove as much of the old solder as possible.
Don’t store a desoldering pump with a cocked plunger. The rubber seal 
can become deformed, diminishing the vacuum to the extent that the 
pump may be unable to suck up any solder.
