When the switch is ﬁrst closed, the voltage across the capacitor (which we were told was
fully discharged) is zero volts; thus, it ﬁrst behaves as though it were a short-circuit. Over
time, the capacitor voltage will rise to equal battery voltage, ending in a condition where the
capacitor behaves as an open-circuit. Current through the circuit is determined by the dif-
ference in voltage between the battery and the capacitor, divided by the resistance of 10 kΩ.
As the capacitor voltage approaches the battery voltage, the current approaches zero. Once
the capacitor voltage has reached 15 volts, the current will be exactly zero. Let’s see how this
works using real values:
