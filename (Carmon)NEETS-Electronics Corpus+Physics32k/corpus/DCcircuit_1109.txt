Essentially, what we have done here is determine the Thevenin equivalent of the Ô¨Åve cells
in parallel (an equivalent network of one voltage source and one series resistance). The equiv-
alent network has the same source voltage but a fraction of the resistance of any individual
cell in the original network. The overall effect of connecting cells in parallel is to decrease the
equivalent internal resistance, just as resistors in parallel diminish in total resistance. The
equivalent internal resistance of this battery of 5 cells is 1/5 that of each individual cell. The
overall voltage stays the same: 2.0 volts. If this battery of cells were powering a circuit, the
current through each cell would be 1/5 of the total circuit current, due to the equal split of
current through equal-resistance parallel branches.
