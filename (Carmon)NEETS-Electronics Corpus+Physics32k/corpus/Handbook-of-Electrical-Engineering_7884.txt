Programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as PROM, programmable array logic (PAL), and programmable
logic array (PLA) devices, are fast becoming the preferred devices when implementing combinational as well
as sequential logic circuits. This is true because these devices (a) use
less real estate on a pc board, (b) shorten design time, (c) allow design
changes to be made more easily, and (d) improve reliability because
of fewer connections.
