The  sine  wave  with  the  same  frequency  as 
the  periodic waveform is called the fundamental 
 frequency. The fundamental frequency is also called 
the first  harmonic. Harmonics are multiples of the 
 fundamental frequency. The second harmonic is twice 
the fundamental, the third harmonic is three times 
the fundamental, and so on. Figure 40-2 shows the 
 fundamental frequency of 1000 hertz and some of its 
 harmonics. Harmonics can be combined in an infinite 
number of ways to produce any periodic waveform. The 
type and number of harmonics included in the  periodic 
waveform depend on the shape of the waveform.
