We note that the impedance representation does not change the topology
of the circuit
devices are simply replaced by their corresponding impedance
models drawn as boxes. The reason is that KVL and KCL apply to a given
circuit irrespective of the form of the drive. In other words, KVL and KCL apply
irrespective of whether the voltages and currents are sinusoids, DC values, or
any other form, for that matter. The impedance form simply assumes sinusoidal
drive and response and captures in a convenient form individual device behavior
when the drives are sinusoids. Thus, because the KVL and KCL equations are
unchanged for sinusoidal drive, the circuit topology remains the same because
it captures the same information as expressed by KVL and KCL.
