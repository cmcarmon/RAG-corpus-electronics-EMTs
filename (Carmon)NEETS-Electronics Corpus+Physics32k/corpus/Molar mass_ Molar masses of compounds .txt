The molar mass of a compound is given by the sum of the standard atomic weight (namely, the standard relative atomic mass) of the atoms which form the compound multiplied by the molar mass constant, Mu:
M(NaCl) = [22.989 769 28(2) + 35.453(2)] × 1 g/mol = 58.443(2) g/mol
M(C12H22O11) = ([12 × 12.0107(8)] + [22 × 1.007 94(7)] + [11 × 15.9994(3)]) × 1 g/mol = 342.297(14) g/mol.
An average molar mass may be defined for mixtures of compounds. This is particularly important in polymer science, where different polymer molecules may contain different numbers of monomer units (non-uniform polymers).
