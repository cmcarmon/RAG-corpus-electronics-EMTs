Modes in Graded-Index Fibers
A rigorous modal analysis for optical ﬁbers based on the solution of Maxwell’s equations is possible only for
step-index ﬁber. For graded-index ﬁbers, approximate methods are used. The most widely used approximation
is the WKB (Wenzel, Kramers, and Brillouin) method [Marcuse, 1982]. This method gives good modal solutions
