In computing, Joy's law, first formulated by Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy in 1983, states that the peak computer speed doubles each year and thus is given by a simple function of time. Specifically,




S
=

2

Y
âˆ’
1984


,


{\displaystyle S=2^{Y-1984},}

in which S is the peak computer speed attained during year Y, expressed in MIPS.
Another statement attributed to Bill Joy that is also referred to as "Joy's law" holds that most of the smartest people work for someone else.
