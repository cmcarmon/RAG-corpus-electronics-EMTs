Thermal (Johnson) noise is one of the dominant types of
noise present in microwave circuits, and it is caused by the
random ï¬‚uctuations of the electrons due to thermal agitation.
At microwave frequencies and for a temperature, T, close to
room temperature, an expression for the rms voltage produced
by a resistor of value R is the following:
