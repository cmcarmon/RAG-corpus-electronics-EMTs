For satellites orbiting the earth it is normal to use the Equatorial coordinate system. The projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the celestial equator. Similarly, the projections of the Earth's north and south geographic poles become the north and south celestial poles, respectively.
Deep space satellites use other Celestial coordinate system, like the Ecliptic coordinate system.
