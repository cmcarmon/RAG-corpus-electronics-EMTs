The ratio property of planar resistance
that is that the ratio of the resistances
of rectangular pieces of material with a given thickness and resistivity is independent
of the actual values of the length and the width provided the ratio of the length and the
enables us to perform process shrinks (for example, from a 0.25-µm
width is fixed
process to a 0.18-µm process) without needing to change the chip layout. Process
shrinks are performed by scaling the dimensions of the chip and its components by the
same factor, thereby resulting in a smaller chip. The chip is designed such that relevant
