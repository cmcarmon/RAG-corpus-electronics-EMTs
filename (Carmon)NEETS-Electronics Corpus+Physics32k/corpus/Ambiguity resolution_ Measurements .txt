Some types of measurements introduce an unavoidable modulo operation in the measurement process. This happens with all radar systems.
Radar aliasing happens when:
Pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is too low to sample Doppler frequency directly
PRF is too high to sample range directly
Pulse Doppler sonar uses similar principles to measure position and velocity involving liquids.
