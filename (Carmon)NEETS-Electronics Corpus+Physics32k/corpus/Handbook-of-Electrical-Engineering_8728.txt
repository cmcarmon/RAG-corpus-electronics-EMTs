Suppose a certain HLL program uses P operators and Q operands to express a solution to some problem.
For example, a four-function pocket calculator uses P = 4 operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. The same calculator might permit Q = 2 operands by saving one number in a temporary memory
and the other in the display register. In a HLL the number of operators and operands might number in the
hundreds or thousands.
