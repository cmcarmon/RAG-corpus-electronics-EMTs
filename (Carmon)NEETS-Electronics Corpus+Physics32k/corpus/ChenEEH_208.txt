Examples of nonlinear characteristics of nonlinear two-
terminal resistors are shown in Figure 5.1(A). Nonlinear
resistors commonly used in electronic circuits are diodes:
exponential, zener, and tunnel (Esaki) diodes. They are built
from semiconductor materials and are often used in the
design of electronic circuits along with linear elements that
provide appropriate biasing for the nonlinear components.
A circuit symbol for an exponential diode and its characteris-
tic are given in Figure 5.1(B). The diode model
is often
simpliﬁed and the current ﬂowing through the diode in the
reverse biased region is assumed to be zero. Further simpli-
ﬁcation leads to a model of a switch: the diode is either on
(voltage across the diode terminals is zero) or off (current
ﬂowing through the diode is zero). These simpliﬁed diode
models are also nonlinear. Three such characteristics are
shown in Figure 5.1(B). The zener diode, shown in Figure
5.1(C),
is another commonly used electrical component.
Tunnel diodes have more complex nonlinear characteristic,
as shown in Figure 5.1(D). This nonlinear element is qualita-
tively different from exponential diodes. It permits multiple
values of voltages across the diode for the same value of
current ﬂowing through it. Its characteristic has a region
where its derivative (differential
is negative.
Silicon-controlled rectiﬁer, used in many switching circuits,
is a two-terminal nonlinear element with a similar behavior.
It is a current-controlled resistor that permits multiple values
of currents ﬂowing through it for the same value of voltage
across its terminals. A symbol for the silicon-controlled recti-
ﬁer and its current-controlled characteristic are shown in
Figure 5.1(E).
