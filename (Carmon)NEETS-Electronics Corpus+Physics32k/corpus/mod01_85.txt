The electron theory states that all matter is composed of atoms and the atoms are composed of
smaller particles called protons, electrons, and neutrons. The electrons orbit the nucleus which contains
the protons and neutrons. It is the valence electrons that we are most concerned with in electricity. These
are the electrons which are easiest to break loose from their parent atom. Normally, conductors have three
or less valence electrons; insulators have five or more valence electrons; and semiconductors  usually
have four valence electrons.
