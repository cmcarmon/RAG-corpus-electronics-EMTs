measuring angles, the radian, is defined somewhat 
differently. It is the angle subtended at the centre of 
a circle by an arc having length  which is equal to 
the radius of the circle (see Fig. 1.2). 
  You  may  sometimes  find  that  you  need  to 
convert from radians to degrees, and vice versa. A 
complete  circular  revolution  is  equivalent  to  a 
rotation  of  360°  or  2A radians  (note  that  A is 
approximately  equal  to  3.142). Thus  one  radian  is 
equivalent  to  360/2A degrees  (or  approximately 
57.3°).  Try  to  remember  the  following  rules  that 
will  help  you  to  convert  angles  expressed  in 
degrees to radians and vice versa: 
 
(cid:127) From degrees to radians, divide by 57.3.
(cid:127) From radians to degrees, multiply by 57.3.
