Television signals in television signal transmission are the electric signals generated by
converting visual images through raster (TV image area) scanning. The two-dimensional image
or picture is converted into a one-dimensional electric signal by sequentially scanning the image
and producing an electrical signal that is proportional to the brightness level of the image. A
television camera, which optically focuses the image on a photo cathode tube that consists of
a photosensitive surface, is used for scanning. An electron beam produces an output current or
voltage that is proportional to the brightness of the image, known as a video signal. The scanning
of the electron beam is controlled by two voltages, as shown in Figure 15.2.24, applied across
the horizontal and vertical deﬂection plates. In the raster scanning in an NTSC TV system, the
image is divided into 525 lines which deﬁne a frame, as illustrated in Figure 15.2.25. The resulting
signal is transmitted in 1/30 second. The number of lines determines the picture resolution and,
along with the rate of transmission, sets the channel bandwidth needed for image transmission.
However, the time interval of 1/30 second to transmit a complete image is not generally fast
enough to avoid ﬂickering, which is annoying to the average viewer. Therefore, to overcome the
ﬂickering, the scanning of the image is performed in an interlaced pattern, as shown in Figure
