Hadron collider physicists use another definition of transverse mass (and transverse energy), in the case of a decay into two particles. This is often used when one particle cannot be detected directly but is only indicated by missing transverse energy. In that case, the total energy is unknown and the above definition cannot be used.

{\displaystyle M_{T}^{2}=(E_{T,1}+E_{T,2})^{2}-({\vec {p}}_{T,1}+{\vec {p}}_{T,2})^{2}}

where




E

T




{\displaystyle E_{T}}
is the transverse energy of each daughter, a positive quantity defined using its true invariant mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
as:





E

(

{\displaystyle E_{T}^{2}=m^{2}+({\vec {p}}_{T})^{2}}
,
which is coincidentally the definition of the transverse mass for a single particle given above. Using these two definitions, one also gets the form:

{\displaystyle M_{T}^{2}=m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2}+2\left(E_{T,1}E_{T,2}-{\vec {p}}_{T,1}\cdot {\vec {p}}_{T,2}\right)}

(but with slightly different definitions for




E

T




{\displaystyle E_{T}}
!)
For massless daughters, where




m

{\displaystyle m_{1}=m_{2}=0}
, we again have




E

T


=

p

{\displaystyle E_{T}=p_{T}}
, and the transverse mass of the two particle system becomes:

{\displaystyle M_{T}^{2}\rightarrow 2E_{T,1}E_{T,2}\left(1-\cos \theta \right)}

where



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle between the daughters in the transverse plane. The distribution of




M

T




{\displaystyle M_{T}}
has an end-point at the invariant mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
of the system with




M

{\displaystyle M_{T}\leq M}
. This has been used to determine the

mass at the Tevatron.
