Between those two layers, a speciÔ¨Åc card service, the application management card service, manages the card
resident applications. The application management component lists the applications that a card can support,
locates them or even installs or removes them from the card. It is a special card service, also provided by the
card issuer, that can manage multiple applications on the same smart card.
