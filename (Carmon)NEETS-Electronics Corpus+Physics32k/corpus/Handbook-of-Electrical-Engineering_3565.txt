To  simplify  the  task  of  fault  testing,  the  physical  faults  described  above  are  translated  into  logical  faults.
Typically,  a  single  logical  fault  covers  several  physical  faults. A  popular  logical  fault  model  is  the single  stuck
line (SSL) fault model. The single stuck line fault model supports faults that denote wires permanently set to
a logic 0, “stuck-at-0,” or a logic 1, “stuck-at-1.” Building on the single stuck line fault model, the multiple stuck
line (MSL) fault model supports faults where multiple wires are stuck-at-0/stuck-at-1. Stuck fault models do
not address all physical faults because not all physical faults result in signal lines permanently set to low or high
voltages,  i.e.,  stuck-at-0  or  stuck-at-1  logic  faults.  Thus,  other  fault  models  have  been  developed  to  address
speciﬁc  failure  mechanisms.  For  example,  the  bridging  fault  model  addresses  electrical  shorts  that  cause
unwanted coupling or spurious feedback loops.
