The rotor circuit resistance can be smoothly varied statically (instead of mechanically) by
using the principles of a chopper. Figure 16.1.21 shows a scheme in which the slip-frequency ac
rotor voltages are converted into direct current by a three-phase diode bridge and applied to an
external resistance R. The self-commutated semiconductor switch S, operating periodically with
a period T, remains on for an interval ton in each period, with a duty ratio δ deﬁned by ton/T.
