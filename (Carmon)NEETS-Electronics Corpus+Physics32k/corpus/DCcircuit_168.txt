All we’ve been given here to start with is the battery voltage (10 volts) and the circuit
current (2 amps). We don’t know the resistor’s resistance in ohms or the power dissipated by
it in watts. Surveying our array of Ohm’s Law equations, we ﬁnd two equations that give us
answers from known quantities of voltage and current:
