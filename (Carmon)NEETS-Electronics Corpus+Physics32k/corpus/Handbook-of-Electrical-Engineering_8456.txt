As the ability to perform computation increased from the early days of computers up to the present, so has
the knowledge of how to utilize the hardware and software to perform computation. Digital computer arithmetic
emerged from that period in two ways: as an aspect of logic design and as a development of efÔ¨Åcient algorithms
to utilize the available hardware.
