Through the action of tidal forces, angular momentum is slowly being transferred from Earth's rotation to the Moon's orbit. The result is that Earth's rate of spin is imperceptibly decreasing (at a rate of 2.3 milliseconds/century), and the lunar orbit is gradually expanding. The current rate of recession is 3.805Â±0.004 cm per year. However, it is believed that this rate has recently increased, as a rate of 3.8 cm/year would imply that the Moon is only 1.5 billion years old, whereas scientific consensus assumes an age of ~4 billion years. It is also believed that this anomalously high rate of recession may continue to accelerate.
It is predicted that the lunar distance will continue to increase until the Earth and Moon become tidally locked. This would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of Earth. The two bodies will then be at equilibrium, and no further rotational energy will be exchanged. Models predict that 50 billion years would be required to achieve this configuration, which is significantly longer than the expected lifetime of the solar system.
