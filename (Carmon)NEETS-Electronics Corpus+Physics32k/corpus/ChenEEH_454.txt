forward transfer current ITf . Similarly, holes are injected
from the base across the BE SCR into the neutral emitter,
constituting the base current IB; a portion of the associated
holes
recombination),
while the remaining portion arrives at the emitter contact.
Under practically useful bias conditions VB0E0 , recombination
in the BE SCR is negligible. The emitter current is then
IE ¼ IC þ IB, and the dc common-emitter current gain is
B ¼ IC=IB, which becomes bias dependent at low and high
injection (or JC ).
