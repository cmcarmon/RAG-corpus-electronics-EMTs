Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  the  operation  of  a  455  kHz  RF/IF 
amplifier  and demodulator stage. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard, 9 V d.c. power supply (or 9 V battery), 
BC548  (or  similar  NPN  transistor),  resistors  of  
1 kO, 4.7 kO, 10 kO, 22 kO 5% 0.25 W, capacitors  
of  100  pF,  470  pF,  10  nF  (two  required),  100  nF 
(two  required),    ferrite  cored  high-Q  inductor  of 
220 ÂµH (with series loss resistance of  2 O or less),  
oscilloscope,  digital  multimeter  (for  checking  bias 
voltages),  RF  signal  generator  with  amplitude 
modulated output, output attenuator and frequency 
adjustable over the range 200 kHz to 700 kHz, test 
leads and probes. 
 
Procedure 
 
Connect  the  circuit  as  shown  in  Fig.  13.26.  With 
the signal generator disconnected, connect the d.c. 
supply and use the digital multimeter on the 20 V 
d.c. range to measure the collector, base and emitter 
voltages on TR1. These should be approximately 9 
V, 2.8 V, and 2.1 V  respectively.  If these voltages 
are  substantially  different  you  should  carefully 
check the wiring and connections to TR1.
