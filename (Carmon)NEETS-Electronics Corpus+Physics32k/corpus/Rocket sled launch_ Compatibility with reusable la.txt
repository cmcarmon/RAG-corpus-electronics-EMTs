Rocket sleds at China Lake testing ground have reached Mach 4 while carrying 60,000 kg masses. A sled track that gave a Mach 2 or greater launch assist could reduce the fuel to orbit by 40% or more, while helping counter the weight penalty when aiming to make a fully reusable launch vehicle. Angled at 55 degrees to vertical, a track on a tall mountain could allow a single stage to orbit reusable vehicle with no new technology.
