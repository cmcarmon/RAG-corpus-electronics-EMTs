Many very hydrophobic materials found in nature rely on Cassie's law and are biphasic on the submicrometer level with one component air. The Lotus effect is based on this principle. Inspired by it, a lot of functional superhydrophobic surfaces were prepared.
Water striders are insects that live on the surface film of water, and their bodies are effectively unwettable due to specialized pubescence referred to as hydrofuge; many of the body surfaces are covered with specialized "hairpiles", composed of tiny hairs spaced so closely that there are more than one thousand microhairs per mm, resulting in a hydrophobic surface. Similar hydrofuge surfaces are known in other insects, including aquatic insects that spend most of their lives submerged, with hydrophobic hairs preventing entry of water into the respiratory system.
Some birds are great swimmers, due to their hydrophobic feather coating. Penguins are coated in a layer of air, and can release that trapped air to accelerate rapidly when needed to jump out of water and land on higher ground. Wearing an air coat when swimming reduces the drag, and also acts as heat insulator.
