The parity check matrix thus has size (N − K)× N, and the result of multiplying this matrix with a received
word is a length- (N − K) binary vector. If no digital channel errors occur—we receive a codeword so that
calculations show that multiplying this vector by H results in a length-(N − K) zero-valued vector.
