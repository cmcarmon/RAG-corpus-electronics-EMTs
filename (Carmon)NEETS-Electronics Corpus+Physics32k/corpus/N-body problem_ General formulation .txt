The n-body problem considers n point masses mi, i = 1, 2, …, n in an inertial reference frame in three dimensional space ℝ3 moving under the influence of mutual gravitational attraction. Each mass mi has a position vector qi. Newton's second law says that mass times acceleration mi d2qi/dt2 is equal to the sum of the forces on the mass. Newton's law of gravity says that the gravitational force felt on mass mi by a single mass mj is given by

where G is the gravitational constant and ||qj − qi|| is the magnitude of the distance between qi and qj (metric induced by the l2 norm).
Summing over all masses yields the n-body equations of motion:

Hamilton's equations show that the n-body problem is a system of 6n first-order differential equations, with 6n initial conditions as 3n initial position coordinates and 3n initial momentum values.
Symmetries in the n-body problem yield global integrals of motion that simplify the problem. Translational symmetry of the problem results in the center of mass

moving with constant velocity, so that C = L0t + C0, where L0 is the linear momentum and C0 is the initial position. The constants of motion L0 and C0 represent six integrals of the motion. Rotational symmetry results in the total angular momentum being constant

where × is the cross product. The three components of the total angular momentum A yield three more constants of the motion. The last general constant of the motion is given by the conservation of energy H. Hence, every n-body problem has ten integrals of motion.
Because T and U are homogeneous functions of degree 2 and −1, respectively, the equations of motion have a scaling invariance: if qi(t) is a solution, then so is λ−​2⁄3qi(λt) for any λ > 0.

For systems in dynamic equilibrium, the longterm time average of ⟨d2I/dt2⟩ is zero. Then on average the total kinetic energy is half the total potential energy, ⟨T⟩ = 1/2⟨U⟩, which is an example of the virial theorem for gravitational systems. If M is the total mass and R a characteristic size of the system (for example, the radius containing half the mass of the system), then the critical time for a system to settle down to a dynamic equilibrium is
