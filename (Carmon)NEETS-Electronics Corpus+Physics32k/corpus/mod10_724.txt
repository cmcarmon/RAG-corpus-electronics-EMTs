With a 90-degree phase difference in the energy fed to a pair of end-fire elements spaced 
approximately 1/4 wavelength apart, unidirectional radiation can be obtained. The pattern perpendicular 
to the plane of the two elements is shown in figure 4-30, view A. The pattern shown in view B, taken in 
the same plane, is for a six-element array with 90-degree phasing between adjacent elements. Since both 
patterns show relative gain only, the increase in gain produced by the six-element array is not evident. 
End-fire arrays are the only unidirectional arrays wholly made up of driven elements.
