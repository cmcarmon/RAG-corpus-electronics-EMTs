The magnitude of resistance is determined in part by the "number of free electrons" available within
the material. Since a decrease in the number of free electrons will decrease the current flow, it can be said
that the opposition to current flow (resistance) is greater in a material with fewer free electrons. Thus, the
resistance of a material is determined by the number of free electrons available in a material.
