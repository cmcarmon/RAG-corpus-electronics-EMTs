Diode Reverse Breakdown
Avalanche breakdown occurs in a reverse-biased plane junction when the
critical electric ﬁeld Ecrt at the junction within the depletion region reaches
about 3·105 V/cm for junction doping densities of about 1015 to 1016 at/cm3
[Gray  and  Meyer,  1984].  At  this  electric  ﬁeld  Ecrt,  the  minority  carriers
traveling  (as  reverse  current)  in  the  depletion  region  acquire  sufﬁcient
energy  to  create  new  hole–electron  pairs  in  collision  with  atoms.  These
energetic pairs are able to create new pairs, etc. This process is called the
avalanche process and leads to a sudden increase of the reverse current IR
in a diode. The current is then limited only by the external circuitry. The
avalanche current is not destructive as long as the local junction temperature
does  not  create  local  hot  spots,  i.e.,  melting  of  material  at  the  junction.
Figure 22.22 shows a typical I-V characteristic for a junction diode in the
avalanche breakdown. The effect of breakdown is seen by the large increase of the reverse current IR when VR
reaches –BV. Here BV is the actual breakdown voltage. It was found that IRA = M IR, where IRA is the avalanche
reverse current at BV, M is the multiplication factor, and IR is the reverse current not in the breakdown region.
M is deﬁned as
