METHODS OF CONTROLLING BLEEDING.Â—The only way to stop serious bleeding is by the 
application of pressure. In practically all cases, bleeding can be stopped if PRESSURE is applied 
DIRECTLY TO THE WOUND. If direct pressure does not stop the bleeding, pressure should be 
applied at the appropriate pressure point. In those very rare cases where bleeding is so severe that it 
cannot be controlled by either of these methods, pressure can be applied by means of a tight, constricting 
band called a tourniquet.
