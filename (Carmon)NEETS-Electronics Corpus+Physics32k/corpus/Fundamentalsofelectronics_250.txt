The simplicity and generality with which we proved this results generalizes to other situations as well.
In particular, note that the complex amplitudes of voltages and currents obey KVL and KCL, respectively.
k VkIk = 0. Furthermore, the complex-conjugate of currents also satisﬁes
∗ = 0. And ﬁnally, we know that evaluating the real-part of an
expression is linear. Finding the real-part of this power conservation gives the result that average power
is also conserved in any circuit.
