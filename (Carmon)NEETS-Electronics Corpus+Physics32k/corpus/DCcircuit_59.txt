You might have been wondering how electrons can continuously ﬂow in a uniform direction
through wires without the beneﬁt of these hypothetical electron Sources and Destinations.
In order for the Source-and-Destination scheme to work, both would have to have an inﬁnite
capacity for electrons in order to sustain a continuous ﬂow! Using the marble-and-tube analogy,
the marble source and marble destination buckets would have to be inﬁnitely large to contain
enough marble capacity for a ”ﬂow” of marbles to be sustained.
