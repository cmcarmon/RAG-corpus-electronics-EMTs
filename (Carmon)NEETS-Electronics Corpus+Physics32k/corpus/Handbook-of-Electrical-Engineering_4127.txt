IEC 1000-4 Section 4. The IEC 1000-4-4 document involves electrical fast transient/burst requirements. The
purpose of this requirement is to evaluate the performance of the EUT when exposed to switching transients
with  high  repetition  frequency  which  may  couple  into  the  power  main  supply  and  external  communication
lines. Table 40.14 gives the test severity levels recommended at the time of publication. The repetition rate of
the impulses is 5 kHz with a tolerance of â€“20% for Levels 1 through 4, with an exception of 2.5 kHz for Level-4
power supply port.
