For example, one may run a number of acquisition scenarios and gather statistics concerning the probability
of acquisition within a speciﬁed time interval or the mean time to acquisition. To isolate the problems faced
in synchronization from the inherent limitation of the channel, one may wish to use perfect synchronization
information to determine the minimum possible BER. Then the symbol or carrier synchronization can be held
at ﬁxed errors to determine sensitivity to these parameters and to investigate worst-case performance. Noise
processes can be used to vary these parameters to investigate more typical performance. The designer may also
