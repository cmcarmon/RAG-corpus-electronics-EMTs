Consider a particle P that moves from a point A to a point B along a trajectory r(t), while a force F(r(t)) is applied to it. The work done by the force F is given by the integral

{\displaystyle W=\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{0})=A}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})=B}\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} =\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {d\mathbf {r} }{dt}}~dt=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} ~dt,}

where dr is the differential element along the curve that is the trajectory of P, and v is its velocity. It is important to notice that the value of the work W depends on the trajectory r(t).
Now consider particle P that moves from point A to point B again, but this time it moves along the nearby trajectory that differs from r(t) by the variation δr(t)=εh(t), where ε is a scaling constant that can be made as small as desired and h(t) is an arbitrary function that satisfies h(t0) = h(t1) = 0. Suppose the force F(r(t)+εh(t)) is the same as F(r(t)). The work done by the force is given by the integral

{\displaystyle {\bar {W}}=\int _{\mathbf {r} (t_{0})=A}^{\mathbf {r} (t_{1})=B}\mathbf {F} \cdot d(\mathbf {r} +\epsilon \mathbf {h} )=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {d(\mathbf {r} (t)+\epsilon \mathbf {h} (t))}{dt}}~dt=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot (\mathbf {v} +\epsilon {\dot {\mathbf {h} }})~dt.}

The variation of the work δW associated with this nearby path, known as the virtual work, can be computed to be

If there is no constraint force, then 6 parameters are needed to completely describe the motion of P. If there are k (k ≤ 6) constraint forces, then n = (6 - k) parameters are needed. Hence, we can define n generalized coordinates qi (t) (i = 1, 2, ..., n), and express r(t) and δr=εh(t) in terms of the generalized coordinates. That is,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {h} (t)=\mathbf {h} (q_{1},q_{2},...,q_{n};t)}
.
Then, the derivative of the variation δr=εh(t) is given by

{\displaystyle \delta W=\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}\epsilon {\dot {q}}_{i}\right)dt=\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left(\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial \mathbf {h} }{\partial q_{i}}}\epsilon {\dot {q}}_{i}~dt\right).}

The requirement that the virtual work be zero for an arbitrary variation δr(t)=εh(t) is equivalent to the set of requirements

The terms Qi are called the generalized forces associated with the virtual displacement δr.
