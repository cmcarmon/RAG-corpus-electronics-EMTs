A three-digit  code  is  commonly  used  to  mark 
monolithic ceramic capacitors. The first two digits 
of this code correspond to the first two digits of the 
value  while  the  third  digit  is  a  multipler  which 
gives the number of zeros to be added to give the 
value  in  picofarads.  Other  capacitor  may  use  a 
colour code similar to that used for marking resistor 
values (see Fig. 2.28).
