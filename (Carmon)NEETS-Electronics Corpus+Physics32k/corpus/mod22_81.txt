What is in store for the future? The computer industry still has a long way to go in the field of 
miniaturization. You can expect to see the power of large mainframe computers on a single super chip. 
Massive data bases, such as the Navy's supply system, may be written into read-only memory (ROM) on 
a piece of equipment no bigger than a desktop calculator (more about ROM in chapter 2). The future 
challenge will not be in increasing the storage or increasing the computer's power, but rather in properly 
and effectively using the computing power available. This is where software (programs such as 
assemblers, report generators, subroutine libraries, compilers, operating systems, and applications 
programs) will come into play (see chapter 3). Some believe developments in software and in learning 
how to use these extraordinary, powerful machines we already possess will be far more important than 
further developments in hardware over the next 10 to 20 years. As a result, the next 20 years (during your 
career) may be even more interesting and surprising than the last 20 years.
