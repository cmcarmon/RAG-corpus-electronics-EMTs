The WLAN standard is deﬁned in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN
protocol, an extension of the IEEE 802.3 standard for wired
LAN. The term LAN applies to any type of WLAN. It can be
based on 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g. A new standard called
IEEE 802.11n is evolving to provide hundreds of megabits per
second data rate. Another name for WLAN is wireless ﬁdelity
(Wi-Fi). Hotspots are another big development in the Wi-Fi

malls, parks, beaches, airports, hotels, coffee shops, and res-

number of hot spots could peak at 150,000 by 2005 before
eventually declining because of unproﬁtable hot spots being
deactivated. Of course, sometimes these hot spots can be
