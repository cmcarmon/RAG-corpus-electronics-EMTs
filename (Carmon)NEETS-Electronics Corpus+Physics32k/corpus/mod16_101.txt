Remember, maintenance refers to all actions you perform on equipment to retain it in a serviceable
condition or to restore it to proper operation. This involves inspecting, testing, servicing, repairing,
rebuilding, and so forth. Proper maintenance can be performed only by trained personnel who are
thoroughly familiar with the equipment. This familiarity requires a thorough knowledge of the theory of
operation of the equipment.
