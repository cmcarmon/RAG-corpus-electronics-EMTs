A basic understanding of electromagnetism is essential to the study of electrical engineering
because it is the key to the operation of many electric apparatus found in industry and at home.
Electric systems that generate, convert, or control huge amounts of energy almost always involve
devices whose operation depends on magnetic phenomena. Thus, we focus our attention here
on magnetic aspects as related to electric-power engineering. In this chapter we shall proceed
from introductory magnetic-circuit concepts to relatively simple magnetic structures and then to
a consideration of transformers.
