Link 4A permits the computer to take control of the autopilot in an equipped aircraft. Also this link 
can control a plane under other situations. It may control a flight out to a strike area and return it to base 
without the need for pilot action. The pilot also has the option of overriding the link. The pilot may use 
the visual display to aid in understanding the intercept controller, or to totally ignore the link 4A
