loss. The Sii(i, j ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4 and i 6¼ j) is deﬁned as the trans-
mission coefﬁcient (or T ) from the jth port (inbound) to the
ith port (outbound) according to equation 7.1. This value
expressed in decibels is deﬁned as the insertion loss between
two speciﬁc ports. One of the fundamental properties of the
S-parameter matrix for a linear and lossless passive network is
the unitary relationship:
