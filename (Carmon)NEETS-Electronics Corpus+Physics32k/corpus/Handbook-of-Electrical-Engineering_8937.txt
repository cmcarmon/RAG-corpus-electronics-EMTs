Data Tablet (Graphics, Digitizer)
A very convenient means for data entry, retaining some of the ease of operation of the light pen but with much
better accuracy, are the various forms of data tablets available. These tablets differ from the light pen in another
signiﬁcant way in that they do not require a moving spot of light to detect the location of the beam or direct
it to a new location. This need for a moving light spot made the light pen difﬁcult to use with the data tablets
initially designed to overcome this limitation while still using a device with a pen-like input. The ﬁrst successful
 assembly from which a wand placed above some
example was the Rand tablet, a digital device that used an 
 electrical pulses into the
point on the 
matrix. By determining the number of pulses in a time period, the location of the wand is established. Another
similar device used magnetostrictive rather than electrical signals to accomplish the same result, and this location
is  converted  into  display  coordinates  used  to  position  a  cursor  on  the  CRT  screen.  The  cursor  may  then  be
