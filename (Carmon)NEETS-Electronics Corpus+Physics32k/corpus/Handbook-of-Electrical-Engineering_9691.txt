 may be either the outward manifestation of a component failure or a design fault. Component failure
may be caused by internal physical phenomena or by external environmental effects such as electromagnetic
 may be divided into two classes. The ﬁrst class of design fault
ﬁelds or power supply variations. 
is caused by using components outside their rated speciﬁcation. It should be possible to eliminate this class of
faults by careful design checking. The second class, which is characteristic of large digital circuits such as those
found in computer systems, is caused by the designer not taking into account every logical condition that could
occur during system operation. All computer systems have a software component as an integral part of their
operation, and software is especially prone to this kind of design fault.
