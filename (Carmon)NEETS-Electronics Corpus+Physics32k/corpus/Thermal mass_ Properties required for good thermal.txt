Ideal materials for thermal mass are those materials that have:
high specific heat capacity,
high density
Any solid, liquid, or gas that has mass will have some thermal mass. A common misconception is that only concrete or earth soil has thermal mass; even air has thermal mass (although very little).
A table of volumetric heat capacity for building materials is available here, but note that their definition of thermal mass is slightly different.
