Another ratio that is used by scientists is the equation of state, usually denoted w, which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume. This ratio is w = âˆ’1 for a true cosmological constant, and is generally different for alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as quintessence.
