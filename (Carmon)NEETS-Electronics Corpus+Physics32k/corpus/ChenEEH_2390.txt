Equation 6.15 indicates that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld
is inversely proportional to r. Assuming linearity, the electric
ﬁeld should be proportional to the antenna input current Iin.
In addition, the phase of the electric ﬁeld must vary as e-jkor to
account for the wave propagation in the ^rr direction, where
k0 ¼ 2p=l0 ¼ 2pf =c is called the wave number in free space,
l0 is the free-space wavelength, c ¼ 3  108 m=s is the velocity
of the electromagnetic wave in free space, and f is the frequency
of operation. Accordingly, the complete phasor of the E-ﬁeld
vector may be expressed in the following form:
