To achieve the greatest possible
computational performance, microprocessors in notebook computers and servers
operate with a variable-frequency clock. The faster the clock, the more operations per
second a microprocessor can perform. However, as its clock frequency increases, a
microprocessor becomes hotter for reasons that are discussed in Chapter 11. Generally,
the temperature of a microprocessor should be limited to about 110
C. To increase
its performance, the clock frequency of a microprocessor is increased until the thermal
limit is reached. How does a microprocessor determine its temperature?
