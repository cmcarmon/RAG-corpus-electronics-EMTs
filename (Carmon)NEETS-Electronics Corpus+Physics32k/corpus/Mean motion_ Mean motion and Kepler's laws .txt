Kepler's 3rd law of planetary motion states, the square of the periodic time is proportional to the cube of the mean distance, or

=
μ
,


{\displaystyle {\frac {a^{3}}{P^{2}}}=\mu ,}

where a is the semi-major axis or mean distance, P is the orbital period as above, and μ is a constant for any particular gravitational system.
From the above definition of mean motion, derive




P

n


,


{\displaystyle P={\frac {1}{n}},}

where n is in revolutions per unit time. Combining with the above definition of Kepler's 3rd law,

and reducing,

{\displaystyle \mu =a^{3}n^{2},}

which is another definition of Kepler's 3rd law. μ, the constant of proportionality, is a gravitational parameter, defined by the masses of the bodies in question and by the Newtonian gravitational constant, G; see below. Therefore, n is also defined

{\displaystyle n^{2}={\frac {\mu }{a^{3}}},\quad {\mbox{or}}\quad n={\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{a^{3}}}}.}

Expanding mean motion by expanding μ,

,


{\displaystyle n={\sqrt {\frac {G(M+m)}{a^{3}}}}\,\!,}

where M is typically the mass of the primary body of the system and m is the mass of a smaller body.
This is the complete gravitational definition of mean motion in a two-body system. Often in celestial mechanics, the primary body is much larger than any of the secondary bodies of the system, that is, M ≫ m. It is under these circumstances that m becomes unimportant and Kepler's 3rd law is approximately constant for all of the smaller bodies.
Kepler's 2nd law of planetary motion states, a line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times, or

{\displaystyle {\frac {dA}{dt}}={\text{constant}}}

for a two-body orbit, where dA/dt is the time rate of change of the area swept.

Letting dt = P, the orbital period, the area swept is the entire area of the ellipse, dA = πab, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. Hence,

{\displaystyle {\frac {dA}{dt}}={\frac {\pi ab}{P}}.}

{\displaystyle 2\left({\frac {dA}{dt}}\right)=2\left({\frac {\pi ab}{P}}\right).}

From the above definition, mean motion n = 2π/P. Substituting,

{\displaystyle n={\frac {2}{ab}}{\frac {dA}{dt}},}

which is itself constant as a, b, and dA/dt are all constant in two-body motion.
