The essential property of a data object is not its representation (is it an array, a record or something else?)
but the operations that can be applied to it. The separation of these (abstract) operations from the subprograms
that implement them, as well as from the representation of the object, is called data abstraction. This separation
is possible because only the implementations of the operations need to know about the actual representation
of  the  object. A  system  of  data  objects  and  operations  deÔ¨Åned  by  data  abstraction  is  called  an abstract  data
type. See Chapter 81.3 on data types and data structures for more details.
