For their voltages and currents to be meaningful, the constraints that apply
to lumped elements apply to entire circuits as well. In other words, for voltages
between any pair of points in the circuit and for currents through wires to be
defined, any segment of the circuit must obey a set of constraints similar to
those imposed on each of the lumped elements.
