Magnetic field strength 
 
The strength of a magnetic field is a measure of the 
density  of  the  flux  at  any  particular  point.  In  the 
case  of  Fig.  1.11,  the  field  strength  will  be 
proportional  to  the  applied  current  and  inversely 
proportional to the perpendicular distance from the 
conductor. Thus:
