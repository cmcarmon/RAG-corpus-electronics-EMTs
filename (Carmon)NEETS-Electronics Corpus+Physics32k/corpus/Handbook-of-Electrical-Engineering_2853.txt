Since the heat transfer properties of the system depend on substrate material properties, it is necessary to
understand  several  of  the  characteristics  of  the  most  common  substrate  material,  FR-4  Ô¨Åberglass.  The  glass
transition temperature has already been noted, and board designers must also understand that multi-layer FR-
4  boards  do  not  expand  identically  in  the  X-, Y-,  and  Z-directions  as  temperature  increases.  Plate-through-
holes will constrain z-axis expansion in their immediate board areas, while non-through-hole areas will expand
 [Lee et al., 1984]. This unequal
further in the z-axis, particularly as the temperature approaches and exceeds T
g
expansion can cause delamination of layers and plating fracture.
