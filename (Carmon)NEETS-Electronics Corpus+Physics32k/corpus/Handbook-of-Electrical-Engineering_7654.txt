Limitations
In the normal operating regions of most devices, a Ô¨Åxed amount of energy, the switching energy, is required
to make them change states. This switching energy can be used to establish a relationship between both the
switching speed and the power required to change the state of the device. Since the power required to switch
the device is equal to the switching energy divided by the switching time, a shorter switching time will require
more power. As an example, for a photonic device with an area of 100 mm2 and a switching energy of 1 fJ/mm2
to change states in 1 ps requires 100 mW of power instead of the 100 mW that would be required if the device
were  to  switch  at  1  ns.  Thus,  for  high  power  signals  the  device  will  change  states  rapidly,  while  low  power
signals yield a slow switching response.
