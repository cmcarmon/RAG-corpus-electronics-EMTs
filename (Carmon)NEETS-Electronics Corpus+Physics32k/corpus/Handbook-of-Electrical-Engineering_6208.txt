where E = electric ﬁeld intensity, V/m; 3 = power density, W/m2; and Zfs = 120p W, impedance of free space.
The protected service contours and permissible interference contours for standard broadcast stations shown
in  Table 69.4,  along  with  a  knowledge  of  the  ﬁeld  strength  of  existing  broadcast  stations,  may  be  used  in
determining the potential for establishing new standard broadcast stations.
