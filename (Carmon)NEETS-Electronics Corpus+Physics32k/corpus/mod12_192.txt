During the 1/8 of a second time interval between T1 and T2, all three vectors rotate in a 
counterclockwise direction at a velocity determined by their respective frequencies. The vector 
representing the carrier, for example, has made one complete rotation of 360 degrees and is back in its 
original position, as shown in figure 1-44, view (B). The upper sideband frequency, however, will 
complete 405 degrees in this same 1/8 of a second. Notice in view (B) that vector U has made one 
complete counterclockwise rotation of 360 degrees, plus an additional 45 degrees for a total rotation of
