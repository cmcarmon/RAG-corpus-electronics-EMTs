It is also possible to use a combination of a process simulator like SUPREM-IV3 coupled to a device simulator,
to  provide  the  simulated  results.  The  beneÔ¨Åts  of  using  simulation  over  measurement  are  that  no  expensive
measurement equipment or fabricated wafers are necessary. This can be very helpful when trying to predict
the device characteristics of a new fabrication process before any wafers have been produced.
