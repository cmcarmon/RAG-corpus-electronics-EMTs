The entropy of a given mass does not change during a process that is internally reversible and adiabatic. A process during which the entropy remains constant is called an isentropic process, written

=

{\displaystyle \Delta s=0}
or

{\displaystyle s_{1}=s_{2}}
.  Some examples of theoretically isentropic thermodynamic devices are pumps, gas compressors, turbines, nozzles, and diffusers.
