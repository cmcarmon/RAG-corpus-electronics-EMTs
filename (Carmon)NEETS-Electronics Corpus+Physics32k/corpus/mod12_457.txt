the tank current is in phase with the primary voltage ep. The current flowing in the tank circuit causes
voltages e1 and e2 to be developed in the secondary winding of T1. These voltages are of equal magnitude
and of opposite polarity with respect to the center tap of the winding. Since the winding is inductive, the
voltage drop across it is 90 degrees out of phase with the current through it.
