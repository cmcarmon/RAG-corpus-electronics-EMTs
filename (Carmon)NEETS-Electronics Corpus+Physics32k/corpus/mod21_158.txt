shown in figure 2-3. Because of the variations in power and gain between tubes and the large frequency
ranges offered, we can illustrate only a general type of equipment. The equipment you select must have
the proper range, impedance, and attenuation to make the test for a specific type of twt. To make gain
measurements, you turn the switch shown in figure 2-3 to position 1 and set the precision attenuator to
provide a convenient level of detector output. Then turn the switch to position 2 and insert attenuation
until the detector output level is identical to that obtained without the twt in the circuit. The gain of the
traveling-wave tube is equal to the amount of added attenuation.
