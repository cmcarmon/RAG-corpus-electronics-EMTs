With technology scaling, noise is a problem affecting all
types of designs from custom microprocessors to standard-
cell application speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs). A noise
analysis solution must be capable of analyzing tens of millions
of transistors, considering both circuit and interconnect noise,
and evaluating the distinct noise tolerances of each node in the
circuit. Successful design methodologies incorporate a three-
level noise strategy. The ﬁrst line of defense is a set of noise
avoidance rules to guide circuit and interconnect design. These
rules should prevent most noise problems without introducing
too much area or timing constraints. Next, a detailed static
noise analysis of the design should ﬁnd all possible noise
failures. Finally, careful circuit simulation should determine
whether the design could tolerate some failures ﬂagged by
static noise analysis.
