Another software-based FT technique is the node-covering
(NC) method (Hanchek and Dutt, 1998). It has several distin-
guishing features from other methods of this type. The NC
method does not require the factory or the user to generate
new routing maps to reconﬁgure around faulty cells or inter-
connects, as is required by other techniques (Lach et al.,
1998; McDonald et al., 1991; Narasimhan et al., 1994; Roy
and Nag, 1995). Instead, the original conﬁguration data can
be reused. This FT method involves a routing strategy that
requires the use of additional interconnect segments at all
branch points of the original (non-FT) circuit routing. On
the other hand, no explicit additional tracks are needed in
the channels to avoid the loss of connection ﬂexibility as
explained by Hatori et al. (1993). Further, circuit electrical
properties are minimally affected by these additional intercon-
nect segments (called cover segments (CSs) or reserved seg-
ments); reconﬁguration does not involve any rerouting and,
hence, is very fast. CSs, however, cause some track overhead in
the routing. This results in retaining total functionality with
somewhat reduced routability or total routability with reduced
functionality. We describe this method brieﬂy in the subse-
quent paragraphs.
