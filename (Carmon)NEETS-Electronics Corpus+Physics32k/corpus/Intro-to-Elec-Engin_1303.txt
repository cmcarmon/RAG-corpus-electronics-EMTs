Thus, the Fourier-series expansion results,
x(t ) = 1 + 1.65 cos ωt + 0.83 cos 2ωt − 0.41 cos 4 ωt − 0.33 cos 5 ωt + . . .
Note that the terms corresponding to 3ω, 6ω, . . . are missing because an = 0 for n = 3,
6, . . . .
−3 s and f = 103 Hz = 1 kHz. The line spectrum of the particular
rectangular pulse train is shown in Figure E14.1.5. As seen from the spectrum, most of
the time variation comes from the large-amplitude components below 6 kHz. The higher
frequency components have much smaller amplitudes, which account for the stepwise
jumps in the pulse train.
