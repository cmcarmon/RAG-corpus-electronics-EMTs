where K is the thermal conductivity of the pyroelectric. It should be noted that the use of these merit ﬁgures
must  be  tempered  with  a  knowledge  of  the  type  of  detector  the  material  is  to  be  used  in.  It  is  necessary,  if
possible,  to  match  the  capacitance  of  the  detector  to  the  input  capacitance  of  the  ampliﬁer.  Hence,  low-
permittivity materials are better suited to large-area detectors, and conversely arrays of small-area detectors are
better served by materials with high permittivities.
