Maintenance is work done to correct, reduce, or counteract wear, failure, and damage to equipment.
Maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment is divided into two main categories: PREVENTIVE
(routine) and CORRECTIVE maintenance. Preventive maintenance consists of mechanical, electrical, and
electronic checks to determine whether equipment is operating properly. It also consists of visual
inspections of cabling and equipment for damage and to determine if lubrication is needed. Corrective
maintenance isolates equipment failure by means of test techniques and practices; it also replaces
defective parts and realigns or readjusts equipment to bring it back to proper performance.
