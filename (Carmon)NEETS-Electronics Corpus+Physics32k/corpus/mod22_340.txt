Spelling checker software helps find misspelled words but not misused words. It scans the text 
matching each word against a dictionary of words. If the word is not found in the dictionary, the system 
flags the word. You check it. If it is misspelled, you can correct it. You will still have to proofread the 
document to see that everything was keyed and that the words are used correctly.
