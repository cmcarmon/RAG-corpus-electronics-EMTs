Channel and Station Classiﬁcations
In standard broadcast (AM), stations are classiﬁed according to their operating power, protection from inter-
ference, and hours of operation. A Class A station operates with 10 to 50 kW of power servicing a large area
with  primary,  secondary,  and  intermittent  coverage  and  is  protected  from  interference  both  day  and  night.
These stations are called “clear channel” stations because the channel is cleared of nighttime interference over
a major portion of the country. Class B stations operate full time with transmitter powers of 0.25 to 50 kW
and  are  designed  to  render  primary  service  only  over  a  principal  center  of  population  and  the  rural  area
contiguous thereto. While nearly all Class A stations operate with 50 kW, most Class B stations must restrict
their power to 5 kW or less to avoid interfering with other stations. Class B stations operating in the 1605 to
1705 kHz band are restricted to a power level of 10 kW daytime and 1 kW nighttime. Class C stations operate
on six designated channels (1230, 1240, 1340, 1400, 1450, and 1490) with a maximum power of 1 kW or less
full time and render primarily local service to smaller communities. Class D stations operate on Class A or B
frequencies with Class B transmitter powers during daytime, but nighttime operation, if permitted at all, must
be at low power (less than 0.25 kW) with no protection from interference.
