When a voltage is applied across a conductor, a current will begin to flow. The 
ratio between voltage and current is known as resistance. For most metallic conductors, 
the  relationship  between  voltage  and  current  is  linear.  Stated  mathematically,  this 
property is known as Ohmâ€™s law, where
