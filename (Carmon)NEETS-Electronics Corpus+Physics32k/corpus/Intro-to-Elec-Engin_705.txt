7.3.8 The common-emitter conÔ¨Åguration shown in Fig-
ure P7.3.8(a) for a pnp BJT is most frequently used
because the base current exerts a greater control on
the collector current than does the emitter current.
The idealized collector characteristics of the pnp
transistor are shown in Figure P7.3.8(b) along with
the load line.
