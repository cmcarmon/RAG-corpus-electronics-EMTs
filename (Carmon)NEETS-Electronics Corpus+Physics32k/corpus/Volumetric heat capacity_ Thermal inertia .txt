Thermal inertia is a term commonly used for modelling heat transfers. It is a bulk material property related to thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity. For example, "this material has a high thermal inertia", or "thermal inertia plays an important role in this system", mean that dynamic effects are prevalent in a model, so that a steady-state calculation will yield inaccurate results.
The term is a scientific analogy, and is not directly related to the mass-and-velocity term used in mechanics, where inertia is that which limits the acceleration of an object. In a similar way, thermal inertia is a measure of the thermal mass and the velocity of the thermal wave which controls the surface temperature of a material. In heat transfer, a higher value of the volumetric heat capacity means a longer time for the system to reach equilibrium.
The thermal inertia of a material is defined as the product of the material's bulk thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity, where the latter is the product of density and specific heat capacity:

k


{\displaystyle k}
is thermal conductivity, with unit [W m−1 K−1]




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is density, with unit [kg m−3]




c


{\displaystyle c}
is specific heat capacity, with unit [J kg−1 K−1]




I


{\displaystyle I}
has SI units of thermal inertia of [J m−2 K−1 s−1/2]. Non-SI units of Kieffers [Cal cm−2 K−1 s−1/2] also used in older references.
For planetary surface materials, thermal inertia is the key property controlling the diurnal and seasonal surface temperature variations and is typically dependent on the physical properties of near-surface geologic materials. In remote sensing applications, thermal inertia represents a complex combination of particle size, rock abundance, bedrock outcropping and the degree of induration. A rough approximation to thermal inertia is sometimes obtained from the amplitude of the diurnal temperature curve (i.e., maximum minus minimum surface temperature). The temperature of a material with low thermal inertia changes significantly during the day, while the temperature of a material with high thermal inertia does not change as drastically. Deriving and understanding the thermal inertia of the surface can help to recognize small-scale features of that surface. In conjunction with other data, thermal inertia can help to characterize surface materials and the geologic processes responsible for forming these materials.
Thermal inertia of the oceans is a major factor influencing climate commitment, the degree of global warming predicted to eventually result from a step change in climate forcing such as a fixed increase in the atmospheric concentration of a greenhouse gas.
