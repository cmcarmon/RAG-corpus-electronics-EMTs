By comparing graph (A) with graph (D) of figure 3-10, you can see the effect that capacitance has on a
change in voltage. If the circuit had not contained a capacitor, the voltage would have ceased at the instant
S1 was opened at time t0. Because the capacitor is in the circuit, voltage is applied to the circuit until the
capacitor has discharged completely at t1. The effect of capacitance has been to oppose this change in
voltage.
