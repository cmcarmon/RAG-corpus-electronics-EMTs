Example 1.16
The energy stored in a 1-m section of the long coaxial cable in
Figure 1.11 was computed to be equation 1.114 in example
1.15. This magnetic energy calculation will be repeated here but
using the inductance expression of equation 1.115. The induc-
tance for a 1-m section of coaxial cable is given from the third
entry in Table 1.6 as:
