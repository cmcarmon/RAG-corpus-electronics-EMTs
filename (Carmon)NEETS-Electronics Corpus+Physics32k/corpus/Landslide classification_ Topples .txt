Description: "Toppling is the forward rotation out of the slope of a mass of soil or rock about a point or axis below the centre of gravity of the displaced mass. Toppling is sometimes driven by gravity exerted by material upslope of the displaced mass and sometimes by water or ice in cracks in the mass" (Varnes, 1996)
Speed: extremely slow to extremely rapid
Type of slope: slope angle 45â€“90 degrees
Control factor: Discontinuities, lithostratigraphy
Causes: Vibration, undercutting, differential weathering, excavation, or stream erosion
