In other words, vO is equal to the power supply voltage minus the voltage drop
across RL. When vIN ≥ VT and vO ≥ vIN − VT, we know that the MOSFET
is in saturation and the SCS model for the MOSFET applies. Substituting for
iD from Equation 7.13, we get the transfer function of the amplifier given by
