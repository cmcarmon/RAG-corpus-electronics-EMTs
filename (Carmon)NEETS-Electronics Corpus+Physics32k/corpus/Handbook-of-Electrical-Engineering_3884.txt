path.  Basically,  by  using  a  stable  oscillator  on  the  spacecraft,  both  amplitude  and  phase  are  recorded,  which
allows postprocessing algorithms to combine the individual echoes in a manner analogous to an antenna array.
From  an  antenna  perspective,  an  individual  scattering  element  produces  a  different  round  trip  propagation
path based on the position of the physical antennaâ€”a synthetic antenna array. Using the geometry described
in Fig. 38.11, the phase is
