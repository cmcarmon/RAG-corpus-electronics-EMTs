exponential factor in Equation (7.2.3), the apparent shape of the I–V curve depends critically
upon the scale of the voltage and current axes. Figures 7.2.4(b), (c), and (d) illustrate this point,
taking IS = 1 nA = 10
−9 A. A comparison of Figure 7.2.4(d) with Figure 7.2.1(c) suggests that
one can use the ideal diode as a model for a semiconductor diode whenever the forward voltage
drop and the reverse current of the semiconductor diode are unimportant.
