The full-wave rectiﬁer using ideal diodes is shown in Figure 7.2.10(a). Figure 7.2.10(b)
shows circuit conﬁgurations for positive and negative half-cycles of the input source voltage
vS (= VS sin ωt ), and Figure 7.2.10(c) shows the rectiﬁed output voltage across the load resistance
RL. The full-wave rectiﬁcation can be accomplished by using either a center-tapped transformer
with two diodes or a bridge rectiﬁer circuit with four diodes.
