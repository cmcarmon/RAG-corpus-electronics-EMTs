The Reynolds number and the Womersley number are the only two physical parameters necessary to solve an incompressible fluid flow problem. The Reynolds number is given by:





N

R


=




V
L
ρ

μ



.




{\displaystyle N_{R}={\tfrac {VL\rho }{\mu }}.\,\!}

The terms of the equation itself represent the following:





N

R


=



Convective Inertial Force


Shear Force



.




{\displaystyle N_{R}={{\text{Convective Inertial Force}} \over {\text{Shear Force}}}.\,\!}
.
When the Reynolds number is large, it shows that the flow is dominated by convective inertial effects; When the Reynolds Number is small, it shows that the flow is dominated by shear effects. The Womersley number is given by:





N

W


=
L





ω
ρ

μ




=



N

S








{\displaystyle N_{W}=L{\sqrt {\tfrac {\omega \rho }{\mu }}}={\sqrt {N_{S}}}\,\!}
,
which is simply the square-root of the Stokes Number; the terms of the equation itself represent the following:





N

W


=



Transient Inertial Force


Shear Force



.




{\displaystyle N_{W}={{\text{Transient Inertial Force}} \over {\text{Shear Force}}}.\,\!}
.
When the Womersley number is large (around 10 or greater), it shows that the flow is dominated by oscillatory inertial forces and that the velocity profile is flat. When the Womersley parameter is low, viscous forces tend to dominate the flow, velocity profiles are parabolic in shape, and the center-line velocity oscillates in phase with the driving pressure gradient.

{\displaystyle {\rho }\left({\frac {{\partial }u}{{\partial }t}}+u{\frac {{\partial }u}{{\partial }x}}+v{\frac {{\partial }u}{{\partial }y}}+w{\frac {{\partial }u}{{\partial }z}}\right)={\rho }g-{\frac {{\partial }P}{{\partial }x}}+{\mu }\left({\frac {{\partial ^{2}}u}{{\partial }x^{2}}}+{\frac {{\partial ^{2}}v}{{\partial }y^{2}}}+{\frac {{\partial ^{2}}w}{{\partial }z^{2}}}\right).\,\!}
.
The terms of the equation itself represent the following:





transient inertial forces + convective inertial forces

=

gravitational force + Pressure force + viscous forces

.




{\displaystyle {\text{transient inertial forces + convective inertial forces}}={\text{gravitational force + Pressure force + viscous forces}}.\,\!}
