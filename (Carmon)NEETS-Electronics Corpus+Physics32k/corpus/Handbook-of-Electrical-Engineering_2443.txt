The  upper  limit  of  the  active  region  is  marked  by  the  onset  of  the  breakdown  of  the  gate-to-channel  pn
junction. This will occur at the drain end at a voltage designated as BVD G , or BVD S , since VGS = 0. This breakdown
voltage is generally in the 30- to 150-V range for most JFETs.
