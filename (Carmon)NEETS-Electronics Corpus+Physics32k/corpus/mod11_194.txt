The baking-in procedure is relatively simple. Magnetron voltage is raised from a low value until 
arcing occurs several times a second. The voltage is left at that value until arcing dies out. Then the 
voltage is raised further until arcing again occurs and is left at that value until the arcing again ceases. 
Whenever the arcing becomes very violent and resembles a continuous arc, the applied voltage is 
excessive and should be reduced to permit the magnetron to recover. When normal rated voltage is 
reached and the magnetron remains stable at the rated current, the baking-in is complete. A good 
maintenance practice is to bake-in magnetrons left idle in the equipment or those used as spares when 
long periods of nonoperating time have accumulated.
