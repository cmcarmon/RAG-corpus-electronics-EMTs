Combining shielded inductors
Chances are, you wonâ€™t use inductors in the basic electronic circuits you set 
up, but you may run across circuit diagrams for power supplies and other 
devices that include multiple inductors. Just in case you do, you should 
know how to calculate the equivalent inductance of combinations of shielded 
inductors so you can get a clear picture of how the circuit operates.
