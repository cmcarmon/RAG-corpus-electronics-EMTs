The tendency of a power system (or a part of it) to develop torques
to maintain its stable operation is known as stability. The determina-
tion of the stability of a system then is based on the static and dynamic
characteristics  of  its  synchronous  generators. Although  large  induc-
tion  machines  may  contribute  energy  to  the  system  during  the  sub-
transient  period  that  lasts  one  or  two  cycles  at  the  start  of  the
disturbance, in general, induction machine loads are treated as static
loads for transient stability calculations. This is one of the simpliÔ¨Å-
cation considerations, among others.
