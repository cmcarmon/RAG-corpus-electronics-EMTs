Trouble in a synchro system that has been in operation for some time is usually one of two types. 
First, the interconnecting synchro wiring often passes through a number of switches; at these points 
opens, shorts, or grounds may occur. You will be expected to trace down these troubles with an 
ohmmeter. You can find an open easily by checking for continuity between two points. Similarly, you can 
find a ground by checking the resistance between the suspected point and ground. A reading of zero ohms 
means that the point in question is grounded. Secondly, the synchro itself may become defective, due to 
opens and shorts in the windings, bad bearings, worn slip rings, or dirty brushes. You can do nothing 
about these defects except replace the synchro.
