GASP; an acronym for the assemblage garnet-(Al2SiO5)-silica(quartz)-plagioclase
GPMB; an acronym for the assemblage garnet-plagioclase-muscovite-biotite
Garnet-Plagioclase-Hornblende-Quartz.
Hornblende
Various mineral assemblages rely more upon pressure than temperature; for example reactions which involve a large volume change. At high pressure, specific minerals assume lower volumes (therefore density increases, as the mass does not change) - it is these minerals which are good indicators of paleo-pressure.
