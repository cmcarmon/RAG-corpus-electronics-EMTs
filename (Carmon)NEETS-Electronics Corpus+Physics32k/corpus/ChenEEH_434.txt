The pn-junction and pn-diode can be treated theoretically
by applying the basic semiconductor equations (Sze, 1981;
Selberherr, 1984) consisting of Poisson’s equation as well as
the continuity equations for electrons and holes; these are
complemented by material equations for carrier transport,
recombination, and generation. Sufﬁciently simple analytical
equations describing the direct current (dc) and small-signal
high-frequency terminal behavior are then obtained by simpli-
ﬁcations, such as the regional approach (Schilling, 1969). The
latter corresponds to a partitioning of the device structure into
space-charge regions (SCR) and neutral regions (NR) in which
only a subset of the basic equations needs to be solved. V and Vj
are the applied dc terminal voltage and the dc voltage across the
junction, respectively; a (possible) time dependence is indicated
by lowercase letters (i.e., v and vj).
