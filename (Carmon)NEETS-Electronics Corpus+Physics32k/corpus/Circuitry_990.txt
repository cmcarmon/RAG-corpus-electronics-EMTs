Karnaugh  maps  can  be  drawn  showing  two, 
three, four, or even more variables. The Karnaugh 
map  shown  in  Fig.  A8.28  is  for  three  variablesâ€”
note  that  there  are  eight  cells  and  that  each  cell 
corresponds 
the  eight  possible 
combinations of the three variables; A, B and C.
