The immediate application of the triode amplifier was in telephone and radio. Both fields were
limited because electrical impulses (signals) became weaker and weaker as the distance from the signal
source increased. The triode, along with other developments of the time, made long-distance
communications possible. Looking back, we can now see that the amplifying tube was the real beginning
of modern electronics and influenced everything that followed. Letâ€™s find out more about the idea of
amplification and how it is done in the triode.
