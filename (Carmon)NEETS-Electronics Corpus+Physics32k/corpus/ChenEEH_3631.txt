Special purpose hardware is also possible for implementing
a digital ﬁlter. Hardware implementations consist of designing
and possibly integrating a digital circuit with logical gates to
perform the basic operating blocks inherent to any digital ﬁlter
structure, namely multiplications, additions, and storage
elements. Multiplications and additions can be implemented
using bit-serial or bit-parallel architectures. In general, hard-
ware implementations of digital ﬁlters are less ﬂexible than
software (CPU-based) implementations. Special purpose hard-
ware, however, is usually necessary when high cost of develop-
ment is offset by a large production and a DSP-based solution
is too expensive or is incapable of meeting sampling frequency
speciﬁcations.
