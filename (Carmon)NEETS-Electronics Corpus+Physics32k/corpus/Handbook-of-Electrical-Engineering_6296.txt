Antenna System
Broadcasting  is  accomplished  by  the  emission  of  coherent  electromagnetic  waves  in  free  space  from  one  or
more  radiating-antenna  elements  that  are  excited  by  modulated  RF  currents.  Although,  by  deﬁnition,  the
radiated energy is composed of mutually dependent magnetic and electric vector ﬁelds, conventional practice
in television engineering is to measure and specify radiation characteristics in terms of the electric ﬁeld only.
The  ﬁeld  vectors  may  be  polarized  horizontally,  vertically,  or  circularly.  Television  broadcasting,  however,
has  used  horizontal  polarization  for  the  majority  of  installations  worldwide.  More  recently  interest  in  the
advantages  of  circular  polarization  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  this  form  of  transmission,  particularly  for
VHF channels. Both horizontal and circular polarization designs are suitable for tower-top or side-mounted
installations. The latter option is dictated primarily by the existence of a previously installed tower-top antenna.
On the other hand, in metropolitan areas where several antennas must be located on the same structure, either
a stacking or candelabra-type arrangement is feasible. Another approach to TV transmission involves combining
the RF outputs of two or more stations and feeding a single wideband antenna. This approach is expensive and
requires considerable engineering analysis to produce a combiner system that will not degrade the performance
of either transmission system.
