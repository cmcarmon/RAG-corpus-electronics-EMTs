Table 1.1: The ASCII translation table shows how standard keyboard characters are represented
by integers.
In pairs of columns, this table displays ﬁrst the so-called 7-bit code (how many
characters in a seven-bit code?), then the character the number represents. The numeric codes
are represented in hexadecimal (base-16) notation. Mnemonic characters correspond to control
characters, some of which may be familiar (like cr for carriage return) and some not (bel means
a “bell”).
