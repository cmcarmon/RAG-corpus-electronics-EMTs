When an SCR is used in a DC circuit, there is no 
inexpensive method of turning off the SCR without 
removing power from the load. This problem can be 
solved by connecting a switch across the SCR (Fig-
ureÂ 33-7). When switch S2 is closed, it shorts out the 
SCR. This reduces the anode-to-cathode voltage to 
0, reducing the forward current to below the holding 
value and turning off the SCR.
