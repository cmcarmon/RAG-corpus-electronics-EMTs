A gyroscope is a spinning body that tends to keep its spin axis rigidly pointed in a fixed direction in 
space. What do we mean by "fixed direction in space"? A fixed direction on Earth is by no means fixed in 
space, because the Earth turns once on its axis every 24 hours, and makes a complete revolution around 
the sun every year. The sun itself is moving through space, taking the Earth and the other planets with it. 
Because of these motions, the expression "fixed direction in space" as used in this explanation is 
theoretical. For all practical purposes, we can say a line from the Earth to a distant star is a fixed direction 
in space. If the spin axis of a spinning gyro is pointed at a distant star, it will remain pointed at the star as 
the Earth turns.
