Simple collision models can be used to estimate the possible dispersion of the orbital parameters given a velocity impulse Δv. Applying these models to the known orbital parameters makes it possible to estimate the Δv necessary to create the observed dispersion. A Δv of tens of meters per seconds (5–50 m/s) could result from a break-up. Dynamical groupings of irregular satellites can be identified using these criteria and the likelihood of the common origin from a break-up evaluated.
When the dispersion of the orbits is too wide (i.e. it would require Δv in the order of hundreds of m/s)
either more than one collision must be assumed, i.e. the cluster should be further subdivided into groups
or significant post-collision changes, for example resulting from resonances, must be postulated.
