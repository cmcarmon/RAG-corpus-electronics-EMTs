The effectiveness of these design tools is based both on the tool’s functionality as well as its corresponding
support  data.  One  of  the  biggest  challenges  designers  face  with  regards  to  DFE  is  a  lack  of  reliable  data  on
materials,  parts,  and  components  needed  to  adequately  convey  the  impact  and  trade-offs  of  their  design
decisions.  To  account  for  these  data  deﬁciencies,  a  number  of  environmental  design  tools  attempt  to  use
innovative, analytical methods to estimate environmental impacts: while necessary, this indicates they must be
used with care and an understanding of their assumptions.
