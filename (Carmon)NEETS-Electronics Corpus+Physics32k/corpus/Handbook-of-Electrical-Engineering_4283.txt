While  the  Doppler  ﬁlter  should  be  a  matched  ﬁlter,  it  usually  is  wider  because  it  must  include  the  target
spectral  width.  There  is  usually  some  compensation  for  the  loss  in  detectability  by  the  use  of  postdetection
ﬁltering or integration. The S/N ratio for a CW radar must be at least 6 dB, compared with the value of 13 dB
required with pulse radars when detecting steady targets [Nathanson, 1991, p. 449].
