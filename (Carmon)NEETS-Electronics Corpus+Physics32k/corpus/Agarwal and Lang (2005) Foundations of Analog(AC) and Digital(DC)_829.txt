Using intuition from the two-input NAND circuit, we can build multiple-
input NAND and NOR circuits. Figure 6.22a shows an n-input NOR gate
and 6.22b shows an n-input NAND gate. In the multiple-input NOR gate, the
output is pulled to ground when any of the inputs is high. Correspondingly, in
the NAND gate, the output remains high if even one input is low.
