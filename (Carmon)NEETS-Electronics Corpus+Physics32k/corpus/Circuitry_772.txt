 Where a pulsed rather than  continuous audible 
alarm is required, a circuit of the type shown in Fig.  
16.31 can be employed. This circuit is based on a 
standard  555  timer  operating  in  astable  mode  and 
operates at approximately 1 Hz. A logic 1 from the 
port output enables the 555 and activates the pulsed 
audio output.
