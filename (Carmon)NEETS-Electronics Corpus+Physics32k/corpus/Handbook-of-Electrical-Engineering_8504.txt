Input  and  output  equipment  is  usually  combined  under  the  term  input-output  unit  (I/O  unit).  This  is
reasonable because some standard equipment provides both input and output functions. The simplest example
of this is the video terminal consisting of a keyboard for input and a cathode-ray tube for output. The control
circuits of the computer recognize two distinct devices, even though the human operator may associate them
as being part of the same physical unit.
