Other factors also play a role:
Muscle Strength
Larger muscles are able to generate higher amounts of force and are therefore able to produce larger GRF's

Elastic Energy Storage
Cheetahs use flexion and extension of the spine to contribute significantly to speed by increasing foot contact time and swing time
