The total magnetization of both paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials is zero in the absence of an applied
ﬁeld,  i.e.,  they  have  zero  remanence.  Atomic  paramagnetism  is  a  necessary  condition  but  not  a  sufﬁcient
condition for ferro- or ferrimagnetism, i.e., for materials having useful magnetic properties.
