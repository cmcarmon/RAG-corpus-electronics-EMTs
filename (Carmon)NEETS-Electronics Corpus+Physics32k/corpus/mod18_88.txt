The factors influencing minimum range are discussed first. Since the receiver cannot receive target
reflections while the transmitter is operating, you should be able to see that a narrow pulse is necessary
for short ranges. A sloping trailing edge extends the width of the transmitter pulse, although it may add
very little to the total power generated. Therefore, along with a narrow pulse, the trailing edge should be
as near vertical as possible.
