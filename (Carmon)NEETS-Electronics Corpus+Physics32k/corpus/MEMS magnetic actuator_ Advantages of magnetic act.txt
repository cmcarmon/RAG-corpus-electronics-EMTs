High actuation force and stroke (displacement)
Direct, fully linear transduction (in the case of electrodynamic actuation)
Bi-directional actuation
Contactless remote actuation
Low-voltage actuation
A figure of merit for actuators is the density of field energy that can be stored in the gap between the rotor and stator. Magnetic actuation has a potentially high energy density
