In indirect-gap materials like silicon, the generation and annihilation (or recombination) of electron–hole
pairs is often a two-step process. First, an electron (or a hole) is trapped in a localized state (called a recombi-
nation  center)  with  the  energy  near  the  center  of  the  energy  gap.  In  a  second  step,  the  electron  (or  hole)  is
transferred to the valence (conduction) band. The net rate of recombination per unit volume per unit time is
given by the Shockley–Read–Hall theory as
