In  the  early  eighteenth  century,  Bernoulli  discovered  that  the  solution  to  the  wave  equation  describing  a
vibrating string can be expressed as an inﬁnite sum containing weighted sine and cosine terms. Later, the French
[Fourier, 1822] extended Bernoulli’s wave equation
engineer Joseph Fourier in his 
results to arbitrary periodic functions that might contain a ﬁnite number of jump discontinuities. Thus, for
 and in the case
some 
of real signals, it has the Fourier series representation
