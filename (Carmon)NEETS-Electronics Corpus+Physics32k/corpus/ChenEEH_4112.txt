The baseband outputs of the data transmitters are a series of
binary data that cannot be sent directly over a radio link. The
communications designer must choose radio signals that rep-
resent the binary data and permit the receiver to decode the
data with minimal errors. For the simplest binary signaling
system, we choose two signals denoted by s0(t ) and s1(t ) to
represent the binary values of 0 and 1, respectively. Since no
channel is perfect the receiver will also have additive Gaussian
white noise, n(t). The data receiver (see Figure 4.1) will then
process the signal and noise through a Ô¨Ålter, h(t), and at the
end of the signaling interval, T, it is possible to make a deter-
mination of whether the transmitter sent a 0 or a 1.
