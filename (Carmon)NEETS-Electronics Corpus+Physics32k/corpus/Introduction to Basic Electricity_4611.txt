Figure 45-22 shows a full adder constructed of 
two half adders. The results of the first half adder are 
“OR”ed with the second half adder to form the carry 
output. The carry output is a 1 if both inputs to the 
first XOR gate are 1s or if both inputs to the second 
XOR gate are 1s. Figure 45-23 shows the symbols used 
to represent a half adder and a full adder.
