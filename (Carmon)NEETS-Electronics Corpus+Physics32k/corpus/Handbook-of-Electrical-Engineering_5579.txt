Fundamental Principles of Protection
Protective equipment—relays—is designed to respond to system abnormalities (faults) such as short circuits.
When  faults  occur,  the  relays  must  signal  the  appropriate  circuit  breakers  to  trip  and  isolate  the  faulted
equipment. The protection systems not only protect the faulty equipment from more serious damage, they also
protect the power system from the consequences of having faults remain on the system for too long. In modern
high-voltage  systems,  the  potential  for  damage  to  the  power  system—rather  than  to  the  individual  equip-
ment—is often far more serious, and power system security considerations dictate the design of the protective
system. The protective system consists of four major subsystems as shown in Fig. 61.39. The transducers (T)
