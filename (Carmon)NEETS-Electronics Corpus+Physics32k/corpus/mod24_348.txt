Some fiber optic components are modular devices that are designed to reduce coupling losses
between components. Modular components can be easily inserted or removed from any system. For
example, fiber optic transmitters and receivers are modular components. Fiber optic transmitters and
receivers are devices that are generally manufactured with fiber pigtails or fiber optic connectors as
shown in figure 4-1. A fiber pigtail is a short length of optical fiber (usually 1 meter or less) permanently
fixed to the optical source or detector. Manufacturers supply transmitters and receivers with pigtails and
connectors because fiber coupling to sources and detectors must be completed during fabrication.
Reduced coupling loss results when source-to-fiber and fiber-to-detector coupling is done in a controlled
manufacturing environment. Since optical sources and detectors are pigtailed or connectorized, launching
optical power is reduced to coupling light from one fiber to another. In fact, most fiber optic connections
can be considered fiber-to-fiber.
