Machine vision application can be considered to have three levels of difﬁculty, namely, that (1) the object
can be controlled in both appearance and position, (2) it can be controlled in either appearance or position,
or  (3)  neither  can  be  controlled.  The  ability  to  control  both  position  and  appearance  requires  advanced,
potentially three-dimensional vision capabilities. The objective in an industrial setting is to lower the level of
difﬁculty involved. It should be noted that inspection is but one category of robotic applications of machine
vision. Two other broad categories are identiﬁcation and visual servoing and navigation. In the latter case, the
purpose of the vision system is to direct the motion of the robot based on visual input. The reader is directed
to Groover et al. [1986] for further details.
