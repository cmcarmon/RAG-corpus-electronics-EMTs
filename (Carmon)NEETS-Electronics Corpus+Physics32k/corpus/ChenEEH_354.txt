of the effective oxide capacitance due to Ô¨Ånite thickness of the
inversion layer, (b) depletion in the polysilicon gate, (c) quan-
tum effects in the inversion layer that increase VT , and (d)
quantum mechanical tunneling of carriers through the thin
oxide, which is a critical issue for tox < 50 A.
