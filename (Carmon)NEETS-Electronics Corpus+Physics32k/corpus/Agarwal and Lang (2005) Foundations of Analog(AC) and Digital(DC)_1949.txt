Let us determine the voltage vGS at the gate of MOSFET as a function of the
input voltage vI for the amplifier in Figure 13.39b. We will use the impedance
method to do so. Our goal is to determine vGS as a function of frequency so
we can see how the circuit behaves for DC for and time-varying signals. Since
the gate input of the MOSFET is an open circuit, the subcircuit relevant to the
computation of vGS is shown in Figure 13.40. The corresponding impedance
model is shown in Figure 13.41.
