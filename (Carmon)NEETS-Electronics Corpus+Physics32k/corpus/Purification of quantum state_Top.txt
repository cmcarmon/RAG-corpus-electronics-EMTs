In quantum mechanics, especially quantum information, purification refers to the fact that every mixed state acting on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces can be viewed as the reduced state of some pure state.
In purely linear algebraic terms, it can be viewed as a statement about positive-semidefinite matrices.
