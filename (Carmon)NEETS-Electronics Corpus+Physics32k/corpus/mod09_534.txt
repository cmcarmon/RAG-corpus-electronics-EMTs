The schematic diagram shown in figure 4-9, view (A), is a PARALLEL-POSITIVE LIMITER. The 
diode is in parallel with the output and only the positive half cycle of the input is limited. When the 
positive alternation of the input signal is applied to the circuit (T0 to T1), the diode is forward biased and 
conducts. This action may be seen in view (B). As current flows up through the diode and the resistor, a 
voltage is dropped across each. Since R1 is much larger than the forward resistance of D1, most of the 
input signal is developed across R1. This leaves only a very small voltage across the diode (output). The 
positive alternation of the input signal has been limited.
