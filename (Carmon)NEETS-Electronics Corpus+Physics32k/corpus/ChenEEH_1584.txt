. Quantitative versus qualitative: Quantitative models are
numerical models (e.g., the algebraic or differential equa-
tion-based models in traditional engineering disciplines).
In qualitative models, variables take on qualitative values
like low and normal instead of numerical values. The
representation is usually based on fuzzy sets and belief
networks. The advantage of qualitative models is that they
map the domain knowledge in a more natural way and
better reï¬‚ect a human point of view.
