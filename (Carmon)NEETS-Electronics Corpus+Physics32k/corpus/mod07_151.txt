A standard specification sheet usually has a brief description of the diode. Included in this
description is the type of diode, the major area of application, and any special features. Of particular
interest is the specific application for which the diode is suited. The manufacturer also provides a drawing
of the diode which gives dimension, weight, and, if appropriate, any identification marks. In addition to
the above data, the following information is also provided: a static operating table (giving spot values of
parameters under fixed conditions), sometimes a characteristic curve similar to the one in figure 1-20
(showing how parameters vary over the full operating range), and diode ratings (which are the limiting
values of operating conditions outside which could cause diode damage).
