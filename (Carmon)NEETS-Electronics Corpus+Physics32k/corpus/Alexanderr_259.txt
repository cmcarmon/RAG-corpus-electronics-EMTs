the output voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 5.31. The op
amp circuit is actually composed of three circuits. The ﬁrst
circuit acts as an ampliﬁer of gain  ⫺3(⫺6 k⍀兾2 k⍀) for v1 and
the second functions as an ampliﬁer of gain  ⫺2(⫺8 k⍀兾4 k⍀)
for v2. The last circuit serves as a summer of two different gains
for the output of the other two circuits.
