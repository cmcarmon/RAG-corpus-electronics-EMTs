Integral equation: An analytical relationship in which the quantity whose solution is sought (the unknown)
appears  under  an  integral  sign.  When  this  is  the  only  place  that  the  unknown  appears,  the  integral
equation is commonly called a Ô¨Årst-kind equation, while if the unknown also appears outside the integral,
it is a second-kind integral equation.
