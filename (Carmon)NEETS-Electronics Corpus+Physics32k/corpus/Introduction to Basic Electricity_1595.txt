The resistance of an electric circuit is expressed by 
the symbol “R.” Manufactured circuit parts contain‑
ing definite amounts of resistance are called resistors. 
 Resistance (R) is measured in ohms (V). One ohm is 
the resistance of a circuit or circuit element that per‑
mits a steady current flow of 1 ampere (1 coulomb per 
second) when 1 volt is applied to the circuit.
