What distinguishes computer arithmetic is its intrinsic relation to technology and the ways things are designed
and implemented in a digital computer. This comes from the fact that the value of a particular way to compute,
or a particular algorithm, is directly evaluated from the actual speed with which this computation is performed.
Therefore,  there  is  a  very  direct  and  strong  relationship  between  the  technology  in  which  digital  logic  is
implemented to compute and the way the computation is structured. This relationship is one of the guiding
principles in the development of computer arithmetic.
