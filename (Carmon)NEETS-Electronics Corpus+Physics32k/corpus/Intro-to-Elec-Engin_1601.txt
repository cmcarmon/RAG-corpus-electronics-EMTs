Let us now consider the single-phase, fully controlled, rectiﬁer-fed separately excited dc
motor shown in Figure 16.1.12(a). Note that the armature has been replaced by its equivalent
circuit, in which Ra and La, respectively, represent the armature-circuit resistance and inductance
(including the effect of a ﬁlter, if connected), and E is the back emf.
Figure 16.1.12(b) shows the source voltage and thyristor ﬁring pulses. The pair T1 and T3
receives ﬁring pulses from α to π, and the pair T2 and T4 receives ﬁring pulses from (π + α) to
2π.
