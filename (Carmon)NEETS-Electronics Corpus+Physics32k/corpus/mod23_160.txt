The only physical difference between a record head and a reproduce head is in the number of turns 
of wire on the core. A reproduce head will have more turns than a record head. This is because reproduce 
heads must be able to recover low-level signals from magnetic tape. The extra turns of wire allow the 
reproduce head to output the highest level possible and at a good signal-to-noise level.
