Personal computers and workstations tend to be resources dedicated to a speciﬁc individual or project. Since
the  communications  engineer  working  at  his  or  her  desk  has  control  over  the  computing  resource,  lengthy
simulations can be performed without interfering with the work of others. Over the past few years a number
of software packages have been developed that allow complex communication systems to be simulated with
relative ease [Shanmugan, 1988]. The best of these packages contains a wide variety of subsystem models as
well as integrated graphics packages that allow waveforms, spectra, histograms, and performance characteristics
to  be  displayed  without  leaving  the  simulation  environment.  For  those  motivated  to  generate  their  own
simulation  code,  the  widespread  availability  of  high-quality  C,  Pascal,  and  FORTRAN  compilers  makes  it
possible for large application-speciﬁc simulation programs to be developed for personal computers and work-
stations. When computing tools are both available and convenient to use, they will be employed in the day-to-
day efforts of system analysts and designers.
