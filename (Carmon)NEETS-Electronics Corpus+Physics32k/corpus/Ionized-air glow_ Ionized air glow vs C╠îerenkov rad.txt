Despite the similarity of light color produced, the Čerenkov radiation is generated by a fundamentally different mechanism.
Čerenkov radiation is produced by charged particles which are traveling through a dielectric substance at a speed greater than the speed of light in that medium. The only types of charged particle radiation produced in the process of a criticality accident (fission reactions) are alpha particles, beta particles, positrons (which all come from the radioactive decay of unstable daughter products of the fission reaction) and energetic ions which are the daughter products themselves. Of these, only beta particles have sufficient penetrating power to travel more than a few centimeters in air. Since air is a very low density material, its index of refraction (around n=1.0002926) differs very little from that of a vacuum (n=1) and consequently the speed of light in air is only about 0.03% slower than its speed in a vacuum. Therefore, a beta particle emitted from decaying fission products would need to have a velocity greater than 99.97% c in order to produce Čerenkov radiation. Because the energy of beta particles produced during nuclear decay do not exceed energies of about 20 MeV (20.6 MeV for 14B is likely the most energetic with 17.9 MeV for 23Na being the next highest energy beta emitter) and the energy needed for a beta particle to attain 99.97% c is 21.1 MeV

, the possibility of Čerenkov radiation produced in air via a fission criticality or a radioactive decay is virtually eliminated.
Čerenkov radiation can be however readily observed in more optically dense environments, e.g. in water or in transparent solids.
