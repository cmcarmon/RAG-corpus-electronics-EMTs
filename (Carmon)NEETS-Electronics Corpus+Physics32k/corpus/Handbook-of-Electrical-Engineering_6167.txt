This section concludes with a chapter on computer-aided design methods that are being exploited to design
communication systems more rapidly and effectively. Many of the problems, such as best location of a large
number of nodes in a network where the construction costs and performance measures are a complex function
of design parameters, are best solved by a designer who works interactively with computer algorithms.
