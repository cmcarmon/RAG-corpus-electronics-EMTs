P = I 2 R
where P represents power in Watts, I is current in 
Amps, and R is resistance in ohms. 
  Since R remains constant, we can deduce that: 
P
In words, we would say that ‘power is proportional 
to current squared’. 
  Many other examples of square law relationships 
are found in electronics. 
 
More complex graphs 
 
Many  more  complex  graphs  exist  and  Fig.  A8.13 
shows some of the most common types. Note that 
these graphs have all been plotted over the range x
= ±4, y = ±4. Each graph consists of four quadrants. 
These are defined as follows (see Fig. A8.12): 
 
First quadrant 
 
Second quadrant  Values of x are negative whilst 
 
Third quadrant 
 
Fourth quadrant  Values  of  x are  positive  whilst
