The intensity of electromagnetic radiation can be expressed in W/m2. An example of such a quantity is the solar constant.
Wind turbines are often compared using a specific power measuring watts per square meter of turbine disk area, which is

{\displaystyle \pi r^{2}}
, where r is the length of a blade. This measure is also commonly used for solar panels, at least for typical applications.
Radiance is surface power density per unit of solid angle (steradians) in a specific direction. Spectral radiance is radiance per unit of frequency (Hertz) at a specific frequency.
