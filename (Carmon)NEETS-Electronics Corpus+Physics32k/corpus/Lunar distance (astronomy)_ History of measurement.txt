Until the late 1950s all measurements of lunar distance were based on optical angular measurements. The space age marked a turning point which greatly advanced the precision and accuracy of our knowledge of this value. During the 1950s and 1960s, experiments were conducted that utilized radar, lasers, spacecraft, and computer modeling.
This section is intended to illustrate some of the historically significant or otherwise interesting methods of determining the lunar distance, and is not intended to be an exhaustive or all-encompassing list.
