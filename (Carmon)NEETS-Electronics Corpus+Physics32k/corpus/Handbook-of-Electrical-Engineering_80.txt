where IL = leakage current, mA, and C = capacitance, mF.
Dielectric Absorption (DA)
The  dielectric  absorption  is  a  reluctance  of  the  dielectric  to  give  up  stored  electrons  when  the  capacitor  is
discharged.  This  is  often  called “memory”  because  if  a  capacitor  is  discharged  through  a  resistance  and  the
resistance is removed, the electrons that remained in the dielectric will reconvene on the electrode, causing a
voltage to appear across the capacitor. DA is tested by charging the capacitor for 5 min, discharging it for 5 s,
then having an open circuit for 1 min after which the recovery voltage is read. The percentage of DA is deﬁned
as the ratio of recovery to charging voltage times 100.
