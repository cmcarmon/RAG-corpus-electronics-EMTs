On 27 November 2014, Brisbane was hit by a Mesoscale convective system which brought wind gusts up to 141 kilometres per hour (88 mph), reaching speeds of Category 2 tropical cyclones, and hail stones up to 8 centimetres (3.1 in) in diameter. It was the worst storm to hit Brisbane since 18 January 1985 and caused over A$1 billion in damage. 39 people were injured, although none seriously (though 12 required hospital treatment). There was widespread flooding and hail damage in the city and the suburbs of Inala, Archerfield, Moorooka, Annerley, West End, Toowong, Fortitude Valley and Bowen Hills. Light aircraft were flipped over at Archerfield Airport. Due to the vast number of buildings and cars that were hail-damaged, insurance assessments and repairs took many months.
