CMOS Logic Family
The active switching element used in all CMOS family circuits is the metal-oxide semiconductor Ô¨Åeld-effect
transistor (MOSFET). CMOS stands for complementary MOS transistors and refers to the use of both types
p
-channel,  in  the  design  of  this  type  of  switching  circuit.  While  the
of  MOSFET  transistors, 
physical construction and the internal physics of a MOSFET are quite different from that of the BJT, the circuit
switching action of the two transistor types is quite similar. The MOSFET switch is essentially turned off and
n
-
has  a  very  high  channel  resistance  by  applying  the  same  potential  to  the  gate  terminal  as  the  source. An 
channel MOSFET is turned on and has a very low channel resistance when a high voltage with respect to the
source is applied to the gate. A 
p
-channel MOSFET operates in the same fashion but with opposite polarities;
the gate must be more negative than the source to turn on the transistor.
