2160 â€“ Some scientists believe there are people born in 2010 who may still be alive in 2160.
According to the UN Population Bureau, life expectancy in 2200 will be around 100 for developed countries and the world population will be about 11 billion. However, the UN has warned that these projections could be invalidated by any change and progress in future life extension technology and discoveries, as well as changes in future birthrates.
