The  maximum  allowable  power  rating  as  a  function  of  the  ambient  temperature  is  given  by  the  derating
curve. Figure 1.9 shows a typical power rating curve for a resistor. The derating curve is usually linearly drawn
from  the  full-rated  load  temperature  to  the  maximum  allowable  no-load  temperature.  A  resistor  may  be
operated  at  ambient  temperatures  above  the  maximum  full-load  ambient  temperature  if  operating  at  lower
than  full-rated  power  capacity.  The  maximum  allowable  no-load  temperature  is  also  the  maximum  storage
temperature for the resistor.
