In the Eulerian specification of a field, it is represented as a function of position x and time t. For example, the flow velocity is represented by a function





u


(


x

,
t

)

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \left(\mathbf {x} ,t\right).}

On the other hand, in the Lagrangian specification, individual fluid parcels are followed through time. The fluid parcels are labelled by some (time-independent) vector field x0. (Often, x0 is chosen to be the center of mass of the parcels at some initial time t0. It is chosen in this particular manner to account for the possible changes of the shape over time. Therefore the center of mass is a good parametrization of the flow velocity u of the parcel.) In the Lagrangian description, the flow is described by a function





X


(



x


0


,
t

)

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {X} \left(\mathbf {x} _{0},t\right),}

giving the position of the parcel labeled x0 at time t.
The two specifications are related as follows:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} \left(\mathbf {X} (\mathbf {x} _{0},t),t\right)={\frac {\partial \mathbf {X} }{\partial t}}\left(\mathbf {x} _{0},t\right),}

because both sides describe the velocity of the parcel labeled x0 at time t.
Within a chosen coordinate system, x0 and x are referred to as the Lagrangian coordinates and Eulerian coordinates of the flow.
