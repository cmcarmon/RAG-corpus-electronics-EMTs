Converter Control of DC Machines
The speed of a dc motor can be controlled by controlling the dc voltage across its armature terminals. A phase-
controlled thyristor converter can provide this dc voltage source. For a low-power drive, a single-phase bridge
converter can be used, whereas for a high-power drive, a three-phase bridge circuit is preferred. The machine
can be a permanent magnet or wound ﬁeld type. The wound ﬁeld type permits variation and reversal of ﬁeld
and is normally preferred in large power machines.
