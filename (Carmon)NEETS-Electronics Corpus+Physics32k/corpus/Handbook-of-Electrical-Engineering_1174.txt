In ﬁnding that signal contained in C which lies closest to x, we are in effect seeking the smallest perturbation
of the measured signal x which results in a modiﬁed signal that possesses the hypothesized properties of the
signal being monitored. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that the measurement process introduces
the  smallest  distortion  possible  compatible  with  the  measured  data.  Although  this  assumption  is  generally
violated in most applications, it is reasonably accurate so that the solution to signal restoration problem (14.69)
typically provides for a useful reconstruction of the signal being monitored.
