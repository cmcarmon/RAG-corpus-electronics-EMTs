Thus, for the quasi-static approximation there is a wave of potential that propagates with an acoustic phase
 in synchronism with the mechanical variations. As will be seen in Section 48.5, it is possible to use
velocity 
the  corresponding  electric  ﬁeld,  –
,  to  couple  to  electrode  conﬁgurations  and  thus  excite  or  detect  the
ultrasonic wave from external electric circuits.
