Problem 3.4: Superposition Principle
One of the most important consequences of circuit laws is the Superposition Principle: The current or
voltage deÔ¨Åned for any element equals the sum of the currents or voltages produced in the element by the
independent sources. This Principle has important consequences in simplifying the calculation of circuit
variables in multiple source circuits.
