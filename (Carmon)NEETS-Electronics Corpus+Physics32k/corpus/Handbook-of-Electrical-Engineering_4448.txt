Subharmonic mixing (where the local oscillator frequency is approximately half that needed in conventional
mixers) has been extensively used at millimeter wave frequencies. This technique is quite useful when reliable
stable local oscillators are either unavailable or prohibitively expensive at high frequencies. Figure 43.9 gives
the performance of millimeter wave mixers.
