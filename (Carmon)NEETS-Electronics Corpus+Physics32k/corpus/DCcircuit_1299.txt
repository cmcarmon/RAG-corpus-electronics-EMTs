Iron is one of those types of substances that readily magnetizes. If a piece of iron is brought
near a permanent magnet, the electrons within the atoms in the iron orient their spins to

shape, which attracts it toward the permanent magnet, no matter which pole of the permanent
magnet is offered to the iron:
