As you can see, voltage across the load went down (from 12.5 volts to 12.42 volts) and
voltage drop across the wires went up (from 0.75 volts to 0.79 volts) as a result of the tem-
perature increasing. Though the changes may seem small, they can be signiÔ¨Åcant for power
lines stretching miles between power plants and substations, substations and loads. In fact,
power utility companies often have to take line resistance changes resulting from seasonal
temperature variations into account when calculating allowable system loading.
