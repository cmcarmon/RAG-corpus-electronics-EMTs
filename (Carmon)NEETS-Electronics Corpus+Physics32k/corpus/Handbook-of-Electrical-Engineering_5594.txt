Distance relays respond to a ratio of the voltage and current at the relay location. The ratio has the dimensions
of an impedance, and the impedance between the relay location and fault point is proportional to the distance
of the fault. As the zone boundary is related to the distance between the sending end and the receiving end of
the transmission line, the distance to the fault forms an ideal relaying parameter. The distance is also a unique
parameter  in  that  it  is  independent  of  the  current  magnitude.  It  is  thus  free  from  most  of  the  difÔ¨Åculties
associated with the directional overcurrent relays mentioned above.
