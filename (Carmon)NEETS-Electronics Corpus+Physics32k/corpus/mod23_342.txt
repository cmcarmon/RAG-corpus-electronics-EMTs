pre-sets the magnetic tape to all zeros. Digital ones are then recorded onto the magnetic tape by
magnetizing the tape in the opposite polarity. After each one pulse, the tape returns to its original bias
condition. Figure 7-2 shows the magnetic tape preset to a negative bias condition. It also shows how the
digital data word 0100110001 is stored onto the magnetic tape using the RB encoding method.
