The BEDSPRING ARRAY (figure 3-15), so called because of its resemblance to a bedspring, is an 
example of a unidirectional antenna. It consists of a stacked dipole array with an untuned reflector. The 
more dipoles that are used or stacked in one dimension (horizontal, for example), the more narrow the 
beam of radiated energy becomes in that plane. Consequently, the size of the antenna is not the same for 
all installations. Antennas such as the bedspring array are commonly used in TWO-DIMENSIONAL 
SEARCH RADARS that obtain the range and bearing information of a target.
