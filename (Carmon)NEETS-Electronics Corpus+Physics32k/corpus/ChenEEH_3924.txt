Fisherâ€™s approach to estimation centers around the concept of
likelihood function (Fisher, 1992). Consider a random variable
X that has a probability distribution FX (x) with probability
density function (pdf) fX (x) parameterized by a parameter u.
The likelihood function (with respect to the parameter u) is
