Recall that the process of ionization involves ultraviolet light waves knocking electrons free from 
their atoms. A reverse process called RECOMBINATION occurs when the free electrons and positive 
ions collide with each other. Since these collisions are inevitable, the positive ions return to their original 
neutral atom state.
