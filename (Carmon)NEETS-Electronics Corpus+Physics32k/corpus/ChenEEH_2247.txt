over which it ﬂows. For instance, a parallel plate capacitor is a
structure where two equal metal plates of area A are oppositely
charged and brought into close proximity at a distance d from
each other. Ignoring the fringing ﬁelds the geometric deﬁ-
nition just given yields as the capacitance of this structure:
