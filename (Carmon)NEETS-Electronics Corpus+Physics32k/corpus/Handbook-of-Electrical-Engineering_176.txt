Standards
Overload  and  short-circuit  characteristics  are  well  documented  by  fuse  manufacturers.  These  characteristics
are standardized by product standards written in most cases by safety organizations such as CSA (Canadian
Standards Association) and UL (Underwriters Laboratories). CSA standards and UL specify product designa-
tions, dimensions, performance characteristics, and temperature rise limits. These standards are used in con-
junction with national code regulations such as CEC (Canadian Electrical Code) and NEC (National Electrical
Code) that specify how the product is applied.
