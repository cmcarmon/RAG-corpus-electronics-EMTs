With any single-contingency outage, emergency ratings should not be exceeded. One loading criterion is not
to exceed 2-h emergency ratings when any transmission line or transformer is out of service. This gives time
to  perform  switching  operations  and  change  generation  levels,  including  use  of  peaking  units,  to  return  to
normal loadings.
