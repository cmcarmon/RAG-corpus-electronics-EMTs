SAW ﬁlters can also be designed and fabricated using nonuniformly spaced electrodes in the transducer. The
distance between adjacent electrodes determines the “local” generated frequency. As the spacing between the
electrodes changes, the frequency is slowly changed either up (decreasing electrode spacing) or down (increasing
electrode  spacing)  as  the  position  progresses  along  the  transducer.  This  slow  frequency  change  with  time  is
often called a “chirp.” Figure 47.11 shows a typical dispersive ﬁlter consisting of a chirped transducer in cascade
with a uniform transducer. Filters can be designed with either one or two chirped transducers and the rate of
the chirp is variable within the design. These devices have found wide application in radar systems due to their
small size, reproducibility, and large time bandwidth product.
