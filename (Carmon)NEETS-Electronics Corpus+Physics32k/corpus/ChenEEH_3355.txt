Looking at the power-angle plot in Figure 7.19, the rotor
angle stays above the Pm line only up to the unstable equilib-
rium value upost
. If the rotor angle were to increase above upost
,
then the speed derivative _vv becomes positive again, and the
speed will start to increase. In this case, there is no scope for
speed v to decrease to the synchronous speed vs, and transient
instability results. Therefore, for any chance of transient stabil-
, vs)T , we
ity, and for response to settle down around (upost
need the speed v to decrease below vs before the rotor angle
reaches the critical value upost
. Graphically, this implies that the
maximum deceleration area Amax
shown in Figure 7.20 needs
to be larger than the acceleration area Aa shown in Figure 7.19.
