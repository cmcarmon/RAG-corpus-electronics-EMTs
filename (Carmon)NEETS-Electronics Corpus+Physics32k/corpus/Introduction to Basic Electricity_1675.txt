A parallel circuit contains two or more resistors and 
provides two or more paths for current to flow. Each 
current path in a parallel circuit is called a branch. 
The current flows from the negative side of the voltage 
source, through each branch of the parallel circuit, to 
the positive side of the voltage source. If there is more 
than one path for current to flow between two points 
in a circuit with two or more resistors, the circuit is a 
parallel circuit.
