Consider now the circuit shown in Figure 12.26. As in previous subsections
of this chapter, we will analyze the behavior of this circuit using the node
method beginning at Step 3. In doing so, we will follow the analyses presented
in Subsection 12.2 very closely, using vC and vO as the unknown node voltages.
