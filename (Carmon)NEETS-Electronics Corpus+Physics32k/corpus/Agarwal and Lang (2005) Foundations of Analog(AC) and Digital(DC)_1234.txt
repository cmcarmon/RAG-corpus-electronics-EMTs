In this section, we formally introduce the capacitor and inductor in the abstract,
and develop the constitutive laws that relate their branch variables. Capacitors
and inductors, which are the electric and magnetic duals of each other, dif-
fer from resistors in several significant ways. Most importantly, their branch
variables do not depend algebraically upon each other. Rather, their relations
involve temporal derivatives and integrals. Thus, the analysis of circuits contain-
ing capacitors and inductors involve differential equations in time. To emphasize
this, we will explicitly show the time dependence of all variables in this chapter.
