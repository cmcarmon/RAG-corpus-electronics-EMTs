• Its core is inﬁnitely permeable.
• Its core is lossless.
• It has no leakage ﬂuxes.
• Its windings have no losses.
The mutual ﬂux linking the N1-turn and N2-turn windings is φ. Due to a ﬁnite rate of change
of φ, according to Faraday’s law of induction, emf’s e1 and e2 are induced in the primary and
secondary windings, respectively. Thus, we have
e2 = N2
