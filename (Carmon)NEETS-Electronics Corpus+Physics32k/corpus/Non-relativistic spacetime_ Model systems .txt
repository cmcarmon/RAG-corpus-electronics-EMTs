Efforts since 1930 to develop a consistent quantum theory of gravity have not yet produced more than tentative results. The study of quantum gravity is difficult for multiple reasons. Technically, general relativity is a complex, nonlinear theory. Very few problems of significant interest admit of analytical solution, and numerical solutions in the strong-field realm can require immense amounts of supercomputer time.
Conceptual issues present an even greater difficulty, since general relativity states that gravity is a consequence of the geometry of spacetime. To produce a quantum theory of gravity would therefore require quantizing the basic units of measurement themselves: space and time. A completed theory of quantum gravity would undoubtedly present a visualization of the Universe unlike any that has hitherto been imagined.
One promising research approach is to explore the features of simplified models of quantum gravity that present fewer technical difficulties while retaining the fundamental conceptual features of the full-fledged model. In particular, general relativity in reduced dimensions (2+1) retains the same basic structure of the full (3+1) theory, but is technically far simpler. Multiple research groups have adopted this approach to studying quantum gravity.
