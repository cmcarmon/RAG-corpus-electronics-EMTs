NICAD and the time of charge is held at 150% of the time required to establish its full milliampere-hour
rating, you will encounter no difficulty in maintaining NICADs at their maximum charge. For example,
you should charge a battery rated at 300 milliampere hours for 15 hours at 30 milliamperes. You can
leave the battery on extended charge for years, provided the charge rate is lowered to less than 10% of the
NICAD's milliampere rating.
