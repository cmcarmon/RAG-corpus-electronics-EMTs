The second type of slow motion is achieved during post production. This is known as time-stretching or digital slow motion. This type of slow motion is achieved by inserting new frames in between frames that have actually been photographed. The effect is similar to overcranking as the actual motion occurs over a longer time.
Since the necessary frames were never photographed, new frames must be fabricated. Sometimes the new frames are simply repeats of the preceding frames but more often they are created by interpolating between frames. (Often this interpolation is effectively a short dissolve between still frames). Many complicated algorithms exist that can track motion between frames and generate intermediate frames that scene. It is similar to half-speed, and is not true slow-motion, but merely longer display of each frame.
