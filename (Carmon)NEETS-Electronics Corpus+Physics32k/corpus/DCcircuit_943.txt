Although it might not be apparent at this point, the heart of the problem is the existence
of multiple unknown quantities. At least in a series/parallel combination circuit, there was a
way to ﬁnd total resistance and total voltage, leaving total current as a single unknown value
to calculate (and then that current was used to satisfy previously unknown variables in the
reduction process until the entire circuit could be analyzed). With these problems, more than
one parameter (variable) is unknown at the most basic level of circuit simpliﬁcation.
