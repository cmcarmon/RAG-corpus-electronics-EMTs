One of the common problems is to have a mismatch between
ratios of the instrument transformers located at the two power
transformer terminals. This is called a ratio mismatch, and it
is corrected by selecting appropriate taps on the auxiliary
transformers located at the inputs of the transformer differen-
tial relay. Yet another obstacle may be a phase mismatch,
where the instrument transformer connection may cause a
phase shift between the two currents seen at the transformer
terminals. This is because the connection of the power trans-
former may introduce a phase shift, and if the instrument
transformer does not correct for this, a phase mismatch will
occur at the terminals of the instrument transformer. The
phase mismatch is illustrated in Figure 9.14, where the currents
in the relaying circuit are not correctly selected. The mismatch
can be avoided if the instrument transformer at the Y side of
the power transformer is of a D type.
