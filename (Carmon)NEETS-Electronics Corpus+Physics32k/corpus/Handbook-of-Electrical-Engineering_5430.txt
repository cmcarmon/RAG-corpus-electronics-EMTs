Though  most  of  the  overhead  lines  are  bare  conductors,  aerial  cables  may  consist  of  cable  with  shielding
tape or sheath. For a single-core conductor with its sheath grounded, the capacitance Cii in per-unit length can
be easily calculated by Eq. (61.12), and all Cijâ€™s are equal to zero.
