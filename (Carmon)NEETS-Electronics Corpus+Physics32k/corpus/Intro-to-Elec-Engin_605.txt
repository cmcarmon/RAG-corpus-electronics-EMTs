There are four different types of modems: half-duplex, full-duplex, synchronous, and asyn-
chronous. With half-duplex modems data can be transmitted in only one direction at a time. Full-
duplex modems transmit data in both directions at the same time; one modem is designated as the
originating modem and the other as the answering modem, while transmitting and receiving data
are done at different frequencies. Asynchronous modems are low-data-rate modems transmitting
serial data at a rate of about 1800 bits per second (bps). Synchronous modems are high-data-rate
modems transmitting serial data at a rate of about 10,800 bps.
