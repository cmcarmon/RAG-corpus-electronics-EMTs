p-Nuclei can also be obtained by photodisintegration of s- and r-process nuclei. At temperatures around 2–3 gigakelvins (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an explosive process) photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei. This is called γ-process because the photodisintegration proceeds by nuclear reactions of the types (γ,n), (γ,α) and (γ,p), which are caused by highly energetic photons (Gamma rays).
