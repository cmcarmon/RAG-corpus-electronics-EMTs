In the Asakura-Oosawa model for depletion forces, the change in free-energy imposed by an excluded cosolute,



Δ
G


{\displaystyle \Delta G}
, is:




Δ
G
(
r
)
=
Π
Δ

V

e
x
c
l
u
s
i
o
n




{\displaystyle \Delta G(r)=\Pi \Delta V_{exclusion}}

where



Π


{\displaystyle \Pi }
is the osmotic pressure, and



Δ

V

e
x
c
l
u
s
i
o
n




{\displaystyle \Delta V_{exclusion}}
is the change in excluded volume (which is related to molecular size and shape). The very same result can be derived using the Kirkwood-Buff solution theory.
