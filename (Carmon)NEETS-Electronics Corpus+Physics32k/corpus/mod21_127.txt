Substituting with a tube known to be in good condition is a simple method of testing a questionable
tube. However, in high-frequency circuits tube substitution should be carried out in a logical sequence.
Replace tubes one at a time so that you can observe the effect of differences in interelectrode capacitance
in the substituted tubes on tuned circuits. The tube substitution test method cannot be used to advantage in
locating more than one faulty tube in a single circuit for two reasons: (1) If both an rf amplifier tube and
IF amplifier tube are defective in a receiver, replacing either one will not correct the trouble; and (2) if all
the tubes are replaced, there is no way for you to know what tubes were defective. Under these
conditions, using test equipment designed for testing the quality of a tube saves you valuable time.
