A classic example of a slow-blow fuse application is in electric motor protection, where in-
rush currents of up to ten times normal operating current are commonly experienced every
time the motor is started from a dead stop. If fast-blowing fuses were to be used in an applica-
tion like this, the motor could never get started because the normal inrush current levels would
blow the fuse(s) immediately! The design of a slow-blow fuse is such that the fuse element has
more mass (but no more ampacity) than an equivalent fast-blow fuse, meaning that it will heat
up slower (but to the same ultimate temperature) for any given amount of current.
