The Studies and Observations Group (SOG) of the U.S. Military in Vietnam in 1967 saw an opportunity to try out one of SOG's new "toys," a revolutionary rocket pistol called a Gyrojet. In one test, a rocket round punched through an old truck door and into a water-filled 55-gallon drum, almost exiting its opposite side. SOG men also test-fired it through sandbag walls and even tree trunks.
