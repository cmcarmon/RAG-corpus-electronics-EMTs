where w(x) is the potential energy that a particle with charge q has when it is located at the
position x. The zero point of potential energy can be chosen arbitrarily since only differences in
energy have practical meaning. The point where electric potential is zero is known as the reference
point or ground point, with respect to which potentials at other points are then described. The
potential difference is known as the voltage expressed in volts (V) or joules per coulomb (J/C).
If the potential at B is higher than that at A,
