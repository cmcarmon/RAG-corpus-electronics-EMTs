Continuous-time  models  are  of  primary  interest  in  the  front-end  stages  of  radio  frequency  or  optical
communication  receivers.  At  radio  frequencies,  continuous-time  versions  of  the  models  described  in  the
preceding paragraphs can be used. For example, one may consider the detection of signals in continuous-time
Gaussian white noise. At optical wavelengths, one may consider either continuous models (such as Gaussian
processes) or point-process models (such as Poisson counting processes), depending on the type of detection
used (see, e.g., Snyder and Miller [1991]). In the most fundamental analyses of optical detection problems, it
is sometimes desirable to consider the quantum mechanical nature of the measurements [Helstrom, 1976].
