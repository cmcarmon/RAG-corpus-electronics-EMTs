Gate Speciﬁcation Parameters
Theoretically  almost  any  logic  device  or  system  could  be  constructed  by  wiring  together  the  appropriate
conﬁguration of the basic gates of the selected technology. In practice, however, the gates are interconnected
during the fabrication process to produce a desired system on a single chip. The circuit complexity of a given
chip is described by one of the following four rather broad classiﬁcations:
