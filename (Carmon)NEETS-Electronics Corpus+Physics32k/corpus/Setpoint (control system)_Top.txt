In cybernetics and control theory, a setpoint (also set point, set-point) is the desired or target value for an essential variable, or process value of a system. Departure of such a variable from its setpoint is one basis for error-controlled regulation using negative feedback for automatic control. . The set point is usually abbreviated to SP, and the process value is usually abbreviated to PV.
