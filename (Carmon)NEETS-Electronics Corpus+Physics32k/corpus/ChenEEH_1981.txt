Another method to reduce memory overhead is generalized
path signature analysis (GPSA), which checks paths rather than
simple nodes (Mahmood and McCluskey, 1988): the CFG is
divided into path sets made of paths starting from the same
node. Because there is only one reference signature for each path
set, the run-time signature of each path is made the same by
inserting justifying signatures in some paths.
