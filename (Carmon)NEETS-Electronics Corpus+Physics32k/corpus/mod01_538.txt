In most electrical equipment, the metal chassis is the common ground for the many electrical
circuits. When each electrical circuit is completed, common points of a circuit at zero potential are
connected directly to the metal chassis, thereby eliminating a large amount of connecting wire. The
electrons pass through the metal chassis (a conductor) to reach other points of the circuit. An example of a
chassis grounded circuit is illustrated in figure 3-31.
