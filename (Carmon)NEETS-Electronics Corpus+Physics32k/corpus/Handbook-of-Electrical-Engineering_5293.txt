Large-scale harnessing of wind energy will require hundreds or even thousands of WECS arranged in a wind
farm with spacings of about 2 to 3 diameters crosswind and about 10 diameters apart downwind. The power
output of an individual WECS will ﬂuctuate over a wide range, and its statistics strongly depend on the wind
statistics. When many WECS are used in a wind farm, some smoothing of the total power output will result,
depending on the statistical independence of the outputs of individual WECS. This is desirable, especially with
high (>20%) penetration of WECS in the generation mix. While the output of WECS is not dispatchable, with
large wind farms the possibility of assigning some capacity credit to the overall output signiﬁcantly improves.
Although wind-electric conversion has overall minimum environmental impacts, the large rotating structures
involved  do  generate  some  noise  and  introduce  visual  aesthetics  problems.  By  locating  wind  energy  systems
sufﬁciently  far  from  centers  of  population,  these  effects  can  be  minimized.  The  envisaged  potential  for  bird
kills  turned  out  to  be  not  a  serious  problem. Wind  energy  systems  occupy  only  a  very  small  fraction  of  the
land. However, the area surrounding them can be used only for activities such as farming and livestock grazing.
Thus, there is some negative impact on land use.
