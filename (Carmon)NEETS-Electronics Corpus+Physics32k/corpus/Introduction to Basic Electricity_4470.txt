A D flip-flop is useful where only 1 data bit (1 or 0) 
is to be stored. Figure 44-6 shows the logic diagram 
for a D flip-flop. It has a single data input and a clock 
input. The D flip-flop is also referred to as a delay flip-
flop. The D input is delayed one clock pulse from get-
ting to the output (Q). Sometimes the D flip-flop has 
a PS (preset) input and CLR (clear) input. The preset 
input sets output Q to a 1 when a low or 0 is applied to 
it. The clear input clears the Q output to a 0 when it is 
enabled by a low or 0. D flip-flops are wired together 
to form shift registers and storage registers. These reg-
isters are widely used in digital systems.
