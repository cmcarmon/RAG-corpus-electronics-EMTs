Tree Search vs. Viterbi Search
A Viterbi search of a trellis ﬁnds the most likely succession of transitions through a composite HMM composed
of word HMMs. The number of states in a trellis stage (determined by the end states of the word HMMs) must
be limited to keep the search’s storage and computational requirements feasible. The tree search imposed no
such constraints on the number of end states as long as this search does not prune out the correct path. Both
algorithms are suboptimal in the sense that they do not guarantee to ﬁnd the most probable word string.
