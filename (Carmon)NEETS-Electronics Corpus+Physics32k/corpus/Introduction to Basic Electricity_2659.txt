In another application, it may be desirable to 
pass the AC signal while blocking the DC voltage. 
This type of circuit is called a coupling network 
( FigureÂ  24-7). An RC high-pass filter can be used. 
Initially the capacitor charges to the DC voltage level. 
Once the capacitor is charged, no more DC current  
can flow in the circuit. The AC source causes the 
 capacitor to charge and discharge at the AC rate,  creating 
current flow through the resistor. The  component 
 values are chosen so that the AC signal is passed with a 
 minimum of attenuation.
