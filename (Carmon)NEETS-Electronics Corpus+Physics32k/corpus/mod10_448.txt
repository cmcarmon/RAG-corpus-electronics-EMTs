Capacitance also exists between the transmission line wires, as illustrated in figure 3-11. Notice that
the two parallel wires act as plates of a capacitor and that the air between them acts as a dielectric. The
capacitance between the wires is usually expressed in picofarads per unit length. This electric field
between the wires is similar to the field that exists between the two plates of a capacitor.
