Problem 4.28: Signal Scrambling
An excited inventor announces the discovery of a way of using analog technology to render music unlistenable
without knowing the secret recovery method. The idea is to modulate the bandlimited message m (t) by a
special periodic signal s (t) that is zero during half of its period, which renders the message unlistenable and
superÔ¨Åcially, at least, unrecoverable (Figure 4.34).
