Introduction
Since ancient times humans have used light as a vehicle to carry information. Lanterns on ships and smoke
signals or ﬂashing mirrors on land are early examples of uses of how humans used light to communicate. It
was just over a hundred years ago that Alexander Graham Bell (1880) transmitted a telephone signal a distance
greater than 200 m using light as the signal carrier. Bell called his invention a “photophone” and obtained a
patent for it. Bell, however, wisely gave up the photophone in favor of the electric telephone. Photophone at
the time of its invention could not be exploited commercially because of two basic drawbacks: (1) the lack of
a reliable light source and (2) the lack of a dependable transmission medium.
