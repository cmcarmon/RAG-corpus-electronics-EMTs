In the field of fluid dynamics, a Rankine half body is a feature of fluid flow discovered by Scottish physicist and engineer William Rankine that is formed when a fluid source is added to a fluid undergoing potential flow. Superposition of uniform flow and source flow yields the rankine half body flow. A practical example of this type of flow is a bridge pier or a strut placed in a uniform stream. The resulting stream function (



ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
) and velocity potential (



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
) are obtained by simply adding the stream function and velocity potential for each individual flow.
