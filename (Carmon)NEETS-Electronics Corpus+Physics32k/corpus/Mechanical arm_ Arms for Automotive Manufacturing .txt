Without the mechanical arm, the production of cars would be extremely difficult. This problem was first solved in 1962 when the first mechanical arm was used in a “General Motors” factory. Using this mechanical arm, also known as an industrial robot, engineers were able to achieve difficult welding tasks. In addition, the removal of die-castings was another important step in improving the abilities of a mechanical arm. With such technology, engineers were able to easily remove unneeded metal underneath mold cavities. Stemming off these uses, welding started to become increasingly popular for mechanical arms.
In 1979, the company Nachi refined the first motor-driven robot to perform spot welding. Spot welding is a very important process used in the creation of cars to join separate surfaces together. Soon enough, mechanical arms were being passed down to additional car companies.
As constant improvements were being made, the National University of Singapore (NUS) decided to make even further advancements by inventing a mechanical arm that can lift up to 80 times its original weight. Not only did this arm expand its lift strength, but the arm could also extend to five times its original length. These advancements were first introduced in 2012 and car companies can greatly benefit from this new scientific knowledge.
