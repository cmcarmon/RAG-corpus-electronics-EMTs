. Network variables that
are  candidates  for  the  state  variables  are  the  branch  currents  and  voltages.  Our  problem  is  to  choose  state
. Like the nodal, cutset, or loop system of equations, the state
variables in order to formulate the 
equations are formulated from the primary system of equations. For our purposes, we shall focus our attention
on how to obtain state equations for linear systems.
