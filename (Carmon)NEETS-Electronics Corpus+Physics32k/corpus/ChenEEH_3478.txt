Electric power quality studies generally span the entire elec-
trical system, but the main points of emphasis are in the
primary and secondary distribution systems. This is the case
because loads generally cause distortion of bus voltage wave
shape, and this distortion is mainly noted near the source of
the difﬁculty—namely near the load—in the secondary distri-
bution system. Because the primary distribution system is
closely coupled to the secondary system and the load, which
is sometimes served directly by the primary distribution
system, the primary network is also a point of focus. Trans-
mission and generation systems are also studied in certain
types of power quality evaluation and analyses. Table 10.1
shows the main points in electric power quality.
