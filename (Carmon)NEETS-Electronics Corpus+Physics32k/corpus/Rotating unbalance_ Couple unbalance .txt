A couple unbalance occurs when a rotating mass has two equal unbalance forces that are situated 180° opposite each other. A system that is statically balanced may still have a couple unbalance. Couple unbalance occurs frequently in elongated cylindrical rotors.

where d = distance between the two unbalance forces along the rotation axis.
