There  are,  however,  some  applications  in  which 
parallel  data  transfer  is  inappropriate,  the  most 
common  example  being  data  communication  by 
means of telephone lines.  In such cases data must 
be sent serially (one bit after another) rather than in 
parallel form. 
  To transmit data in serial form, the parallel data 
from the microprocessor must be reorganized into a 
stream  of  bits.  This  task  is  greatly  simplified  by 
using  an  LSI  interface  device  that  contains  a  shift 
register  that  is  loaded  with  parallel  data  from  the 
data  bus.  This  data  is  then  read  out  as  a  serial  bit 
stream by successive shifting.  The reverse process, 
serial-to-parallel  conversion,  also  uses  a  shift 
register. Here data is loaded in serial form, each bit 
shifting  further  into  the  register  until  it  becomes 
full.  Data  is  then  placed  simultaneously  on  the 
parallel  output  lines.    The  basic  principles  of 
parallel-to-serial 
data 
conversion are illustrated in Fig. 11.9. 
 
An example program 
 
The following example program (see Table 11.3) is 
written in assembly code. The program transfers 8-
bit data from an input port (Port A), complements
