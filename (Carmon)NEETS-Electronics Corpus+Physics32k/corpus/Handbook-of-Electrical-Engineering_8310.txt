Before  discussing  the  various  techniques  that  may  be  used  to  improve  testability  of  digital  circuits,  it  is
necessary to mention the related problem of determining test effectiveness. A typical digital system contains a
very large number of possible stuck-at faults. This and the logical complexity of the circuits make it unacceptable
to “guess”  how  effective  the  test  patterns  (or  the  diagnostic  program)  will  be  in  detecting  all  possible  faults.
This  problem  is  often  approached  in  a  formal  manner  by  using  a  class  of  test  tool  called  a  fault  simulator
program. A fault simulator uses the given set of test patterns to simulate the given circuit ﬁrst when there are
no faults assumed present (i.e., good circuit simulation). Next, the circuit is simulated with the same set of test
patterns, but this time the effects of each possible stuck-at fault are considered one at a time. For a given test
pattern,  and  given  stuck-at-type  fault,  if  the  output  of  the  good  circuit  simulation  differs  from  the  output
obtained during fault simulation, then the given fault will be detected by the given test pattern. This way, it is
possible to determine the percentage of all possible stuck-at faults that may be present in a digital circuit which
will be covered by the given set of test patterns.
