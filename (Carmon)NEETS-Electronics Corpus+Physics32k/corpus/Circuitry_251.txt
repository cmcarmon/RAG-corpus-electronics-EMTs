BJT operation 
 
Bipolar  junction  transistors  generally  comprise 
NPN  or  PNP  junctions  of  either  silicon  (Si) or 
germanium (Ge) material (see Figs 5.17 and 5.18). 
The junctions are, in fact, produced in a single slice 
of  silicon  by  diffusing 
through  a 
photographically  reduced  mask.  Silicon  transistors 
are  superior  when  compared  with  germanium 
transistors  in  the  vast  majority  of  applications 
(particularly  at  high 
thus 
germanium devices are very rarely encountered.  
  Figures 5.19(a) and 5.19(b), respectively, show a 
simplified 
representation  of  NPN  and  PNP 
transistors  together  with  their  circuit  symbols.  In 
either  case  the  electrodes  are  labelled  collector, 
base  and  emitter. Note  that  each  junction  within 
the transistor, whether it be collector-base or base-
emitter, constitutes a P-N junction. Figures 5.20(a) 
and  5.20(b),  respectively,  show  the  normal  bias 
voltages applied to NPN and PNP transistors. Note 
that the base-emitter junction is forward biased and 
the  collector-base  junction  is  reverse  biased.  The
