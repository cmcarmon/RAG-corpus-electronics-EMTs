In the Schwarzschild metric, free-falling objects can be in circular orbits if the orbital radius is larger than

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {3}{2}}r_{s}}
(the radius of the photon sphere). The formula for a clock at rest is given above; the formula below gives the gravitational time dilation for a clock in a circular orbit but it does not include the opposing time dilation caused by the clock's motion. (Both dilations are shown in the figure below).
