The technology of television is based on the conversion of light rays from still or moving scenes and pictures
into electronic signals for transmission or storage, and subsequent reconversion into visual images on a screen.
A  similar  function  is  provided  in  the  production  of  motion  picture  ﬁlm;  however,  where  ﬁlm  records  the
