The process of alignment in the electric ﬁeld is the result of the anisotropic dielectric constant characteristic
of  liquid  crystals.  For  the  electric  ﬁeld  parallel  to  the  molecular  alignment, er  = e||,  and  for  a  perpendicular
ﬁeld, er  = e^.  In  a “positive”  liquid  crystal, e||  > e^,  and  the  molecules  align  parallel  to  the  ﬁeld  as  described
above in order to minimize the system’s potential energy.
