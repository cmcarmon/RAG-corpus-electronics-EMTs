The polyphase synchronous machine is one in which the rotor rotates in synchronism with
and in the same direction as the rotating mmf wave produced by the stator. Thus for synchronous
machines with polyphase stator winding, the following equation relating mechanical and electrical
angular speeds is satisÔ¨Åed:
