Interconnection Performance Modeling
Accurate estimation of signal timing is increasingly important in contemporary VLSI ASICs and will become
even  more  important  as  feature  sizes  decrease  further.  Higher  clock  rates  impose  tighter  timing  margins,
requiring more accurate modeling of the signal delays. In addition, more-sophisticated models are required for
smaller feature size VLSI.
