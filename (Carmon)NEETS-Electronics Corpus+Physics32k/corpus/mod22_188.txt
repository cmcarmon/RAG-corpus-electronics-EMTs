Computers can process hundreds of thousands of computer words or characters per second. Thus, a 
study of the first method (manual input) reflects the inability of human-operated keyboards or keypunches 
to supply data at a speed that matches the speed of digital computers. A high average speed for keyboard 
operation is two or three characters per second, that, when coded to form computer words, would reduce 
the data input rate to the computer to less than a computer word per second. Since mainframe computers 
are capable of reading several thousand times this amount of information per second, it is clear that 
manual inputs should be minimized to make more efficient use of computer time. However, as a rule, the 
keyboard is the normal input media for microcomputers.
