In a pure inclination change, only the inclination of the orbit is changed while all other orbital characteristics (radius, shape, etc.) remains the same as before. Delta-v (

{\displaystyle \Delta {v_{i}}\,}

{\displaystyle \Delta {v_{i}}={2\sin({\frac {\Delta {i}}{2}}){\sqrt {1-e^{2}}}\cos(\omega +f)na \over {(1+e\cos(f))}}}

where:




e



{\displaystyle e\,}
is the orbital eccentricity




ω



{\displaystyle \omega \,}
is the argument of periapsis




f



{\displaystyle f\,}
is the true anomaly




n



{\displaystyle n\,}
is the mean motion




a



{\displaystyle a\,}
is the semi-major axis
For more complicated maneuvers which may involve a combination of change in inclination and orbital radius, the amount of delta v is the vector difference between the velocity vectors of the initial orbit and the desired orbit at the transfer point.
