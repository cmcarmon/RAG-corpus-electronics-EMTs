If the reflecting surface is very smooth, the reflection of light that occurs is called specular or regular reflection. The laws of reflection are as follows:
The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal to the reflection surface at the point of the incidence lie in the same plane.
The angle which the incident ray makes with the normal is equal to the angle which the reflected ray makes to the same normal.
The reflected ray and the incident ray are on the opposite sides of the normal.
These three laws can all be derived from the Fresnel equations.
