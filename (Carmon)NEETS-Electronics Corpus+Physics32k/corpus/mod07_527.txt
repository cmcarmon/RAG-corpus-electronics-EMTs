Since use of a variable resistor is not a practical way to control current fluctuation or variation, a 
transistor and a Zener diode, together with necessary resistors, are used. Recall that the Zener diode 
provides a constant reference voltage. The schematic shown in figure 4-41 is that of a current regulator 
circuit. Except for the addition of R1, the circuit shown in the figure is similar to that of a series voltage 
regulator. The resistor is connected in series with the load and senses any current changes in the load. 
Notice the voltage drop across R1 and the negative voltage polarity applied to the emitter of Q1. The
