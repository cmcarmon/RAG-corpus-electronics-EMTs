Tachyarrhythmias
Tachyarrhythmias are generally deﬁned as heart rates that are abnormally or inappropriately fast (>100 b.p.m.)
[Katz, 1992]. There are many different types of tachyarrhythmias (tachycardias). They are caused by “runaway”
depolarization wavefronts that may continue to rapidly activate the same tissue over and over again by a process
known as reentry. This can result from a number of underlying physiological problems, such as dying tissue
with altered conduction properties due to a blocked coronary artery, around which the wavefront can propagate.
The atria and the ventricles can both experience tachycardia. Although somewhat debilitating, atrial tachycardias
are  not  immediately  life  threatening;  however,  most  ventricular  tachycardias  are  life  threatening.  The  most
serious ventricular tachycardia, ventricular ﬁbrillation, has been deﬁned as the rapid, disorganized, and asyn-
chronous  contraction  of  ventricular  muscle  [Epstein  and  Ideker,  1995]  during  which  the  heart’s  ability  to
distribute  blood  to  the  body  is  completely  compromised.  If  not  immediately  treated  with  a  deﬁbrillating
electrical shock, loss of life will follow in only minutes. Ventricular ﬁbrillation is the most common cause of
sudden  cardiac  death,  of  which  nearly  400,000  people  die  annually  in  the  U.S.  alone  [Gillum,  1989].  The
Implantable Cardioverter Deﬁbrillator (ICD) was developed in an attempt to terminate ventricular ﬁbrillation
and prevent sudden death from occurring.
