â€¢ Lock-out/Tag-out works like this: when working on a system in a Zero Energy State, the
worker places a personal padlock or combination lock on every energy disconnect device
relevant to his or her task on that system. Also, a tag is hung on every one of those locks
describing the nature and duration of the work to be done, and who is doing it.
