The continuously mixed tank reactor is an open system with an influent stream of reactants and an effluent stream of products. A lake can be regarded as a tank reactor, and lakes with long turnover times (e.g. with low flux-to-volume ratios) can for many purposes be regarded as continuously stirred (e.g. homogeneous in all respects). The mass balance then becomes



where Q0 and Q denote the volumetric flow in and out of the system respectively and CA,0 and CA the concentration of A in the inflow and outflow respective. In an open system we can never reach a chemical equilibrium. We can, however, reach a steady state where all state variables (temperature, concentrations etc.) remain constant (
