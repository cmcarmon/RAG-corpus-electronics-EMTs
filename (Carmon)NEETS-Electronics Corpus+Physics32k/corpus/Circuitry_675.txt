DO’s and DON’Ts of using a digital multimeter 
 
DO ensure that you have selected the correct range 
and  measuring  function  before  attempting 
to 
connect the meter into a circuit. 
 
DO  select  a  higher  range  than  expected  and  then 
progressively  increase  the  sensitivity  as  necessary 
to obtain a meaningful indication. 
 
DO switch the meter to the ‘off’ position in order to 
conserve  battery  life  when  the  instrument  is  not 
being used. 
 
DO  check  and,  if  necessary,  replace  the  internal 
battery regularly. 
 
DO use properly insulated test leads and prods. 
 
DO  check  that  a  suitably  rated  fuse  is  used  in 
conjunction  with  the  current  ranges  (if  the  current 
ranges aren’t  working  it’s probably the fuse that’s 
blown!).
