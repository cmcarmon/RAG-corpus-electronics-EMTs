PHASEÂ—The angular relationship between two alternating currents or voltages when the voltage or current 
is plotted as a function of time. When the two are in phase, the angle is zero; both reach their peak 
simultaneously. When out of phase, one will lead or lag the other; that is, at the instant when one is at 
its peak, the other will not be at peak value and (depending on the phase angle) may differ in polarity as 
well as magnitude [2].
