For a linear system in which B and H, λ and i, or φ and F are proportional, it is easy to see that
the energy and the coenergy are numerically equal. For a nonlinear system, on the other hand,
the energy and the coenergy differ, as shown in Figure 12.4.1, but the sum of the energy and the
coenergy for a singly excited system is given by
