Overpressure in an enclosed space is determined using "Weibull's formula":




Î”
p
=
2410


(


m
V


)


0.72




{\displaystyle \Delta p=2410\left({m \over V}\right)^{0.72}}

where:
2410 is a constant based on 1 bar (100 kPa; 15 psi)




m



{\displaystyle m\,}
= net explosive mass calculated using all explosive materials and their relative effectiveness




V



{\displaystyle V\,}
= volume of given area (primarily used to determine volume within an enclosed space)
