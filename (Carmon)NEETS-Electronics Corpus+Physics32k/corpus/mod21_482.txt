modulated wave to the vertical input of the oscilloscope. The trapezoidal pattern is obtained in a similar 
manner except that the modulation signal from the transmitter is used to horizontally sweep the 
oscilloscope (instead of having the sweep signal generated internally by the oscilloscope). Both methods 
are limited by the frequency response of the oscilloscope; therefore, these methods find greater 
applicability in the lf to hf ranges.
