Other familiar deformations in physics involve:
The deformation of classical Newtonian into relativistic mechanics (special relativity), with deformation parameter v/c; the classical limit involves small speeds, so v/c→0, and the systems appear to obey Newtonian mechanics.
Similarly for the deformation of Newtonian gravity into general relativity, with deformation parameter Schwarzschild-radius/characteristic-dimension, we find that objects once again appear to obey classical mechanics (flat space), when the mass of an object times the square of the Planck length is much smaller than its size and the sizes of the problem addressed.
Wave optics might also be regarded as a deformation of ray optics for deformation parameter λ/a.
Likewise, thermodynamics deforms to statistical mechanics with deformation parameter 1/N.
