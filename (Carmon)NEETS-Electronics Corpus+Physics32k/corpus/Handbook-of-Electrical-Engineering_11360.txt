Clinically, the impact of computerized tomography was dramatic due to the vastly increased density resolu-
tion, coupled with the elimination of the superposition of overlying structures, allowing enhanced differenti-
ation of tissues with similar x-ray transmittance, such as blood, muscle, and organ parenchyma. CT scans of
the head are useful for evaluation of head injury and detection of tumor, stroke, or infection. In the body, CT
is also excellent in detecting and characterizing focal lesions, such as tumors and abscesses, and for the evaluation
of the skeletal system. [Axel et al., 1983]. In recent years the advent of magnetic resonance systems has provided
even  greater  soft  tissue  contrast,  and  thus  the  role  of  CT  has  been  constrained  by  this  at  times  competing
modality.
