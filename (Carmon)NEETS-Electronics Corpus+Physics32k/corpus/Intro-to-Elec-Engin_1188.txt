Constructional Features of DC Machines
A dc generator or motor may have as many as four ﬁeld windings, depending on the type and size of
the machine and the kind of service intended. These ﬁeld windings consist of two normal exciting
ﬁelds, the shunt and series windings, and two ﬁelds that act in a corrective capacity to combat
the detrimental effects of armature reaction, called the commutating (compole or interpole) and
compensating windings, which are connected in series with the armature. The type of machine,
whether shunt, series, or compound, is determined solely by the normal exciting-ﬁeld circuit
connections, as shown in Figure 13.1.8. Figure 13.4.1 illustrates how various ﬁeld windings
are arranged with respect to one another in part of a cross section of a dc machine, whereas
Figure 13.4.2 shows the schematic connection diagram of a dc machine. The commutating and
compensating windings, their purpose, as well as the circuit connections are presented later in
this section.
