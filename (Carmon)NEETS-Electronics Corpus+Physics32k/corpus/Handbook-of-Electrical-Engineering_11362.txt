The positron or positive electron is a positively charged particle that can be emitted from the nucleus of a
radionuclide.  The  positron  travels  at  most  a  few  millimeters  before  being  annihilated  by  interaction  with  a
negative electron from the surrounding tissue. The product of this event is the emission of 511-keV gamma
ray photons which travel in almost exactly opposite directions. The detectors themselves can be either discrete
detectors or a modiÔ¨Åed Anger camera like those used in conventional nuclear imaging. A coincidence detector
is employed to limit recorded outputs to cases in which events are detected simultaneously in both detector
arrays, thus reducing the pickup of noise or scattering.
