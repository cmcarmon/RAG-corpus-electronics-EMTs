AVALANCHE TRANSIT-TIME DIODES.â€”Avalanche transit-time diodes, also called IMPATT 
(Impact Avalanche and Transit-Time) diodes, are multilayer diodes of several different types used to 
generate microwave power. The earliest of the avalanche transit-time diodes consists of four layers in a 
pnin arrangement.The intrinsic (i) layer has neither p nor n properties.
