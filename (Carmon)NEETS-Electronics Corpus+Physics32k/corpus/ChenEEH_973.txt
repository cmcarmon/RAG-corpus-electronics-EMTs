Step 4. The circuit graph is traversed to determine the edges
in the skew basis sb and in the skew chords sc. This
graph traversal is accomplished by using a depth-ﬁrst
search (West, 1996; Reingold et al., 1997; Cormen
et al., 1989) algorithm—the classical traversal algo-
rithm of choice for building a spanning tree. Three
additional important tasks are accomplished during
the traversal step:
