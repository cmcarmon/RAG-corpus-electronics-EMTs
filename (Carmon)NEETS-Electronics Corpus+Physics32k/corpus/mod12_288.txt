Semiconductor Reactance Modulator.â€”The SEMICONDUCTOR-REACTANCE MODULATOR
is used to frequency modulate low-power semiconductor transmitters. Figure 2-12 shows a typical
frequency-modulated oscillator stage operated as a reactance modulator. Q1, along with its associated
circuitry, is the oscillator. Q2 is the modulator and is connected to the circuit so that its collector-to-
emitter capacitance (CCE) is in parallel with a portion of the rf oscillator coil, L1. As the modulator
operates, the output capacitance of Q2 is varied. Thus, the frequency of the oscillator is shifted in
accordance with the modulation the same as if C1 were varied.
