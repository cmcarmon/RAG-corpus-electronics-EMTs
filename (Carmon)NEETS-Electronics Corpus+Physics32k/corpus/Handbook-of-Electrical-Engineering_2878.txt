It should be noted at this point that there are three distinctly different “solder balls” referred to in this chapter
and in publications discussing SMT. The solder sphere test refers to the ability of a volume of solder to form
a ball shape due to its inherent surface tension when reﬂowed (melted) on a non-wettable surface. This ball
formation is dependent on minimum oxides on the microscopic metal balls which make up the paste — the
second type of “solder ball”. It is also dependent on the ability of the ﬂux to reduce the oxides that are present,
as well the ramp-up of temperature during the preheat and drying phases of the reﬂow oven proﬁle. Too steep
a time/temperature slope can cause rapid escape of entrapped volatile solvents, resulting in expulsion of small
amounts of metal that will form undesirable “solder balls” of the third type, small metal balls scattered around
the solder joint(s) on the substrate itself rather than on the tinned metal of the joint. This third type of ball can
also be formed by excess solder paste on the pad, and by mis-deposition on non-wettable areas of the substrate.
The reader is referred to Lau [1991] for discussions of ﬁnite element modeling of solder joints, and detailed
analytical studies of most aspects of basic joints and of joint failures. Various articles by Engelmaier et al. also
address many solder joint reliability issues and their analytical analysis. These and other sources will discuss in
detail the quality issues that effect solder paste:
