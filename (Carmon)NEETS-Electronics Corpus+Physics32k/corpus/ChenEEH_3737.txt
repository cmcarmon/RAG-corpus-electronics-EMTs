Generally speaking, DTW is used to match an incoming test
word (represented by a string of features) with numerous
reference words (also represented by feature strings). The
reference word with the best match score is declared the
‘‘recognized’’ word. In fairness to the correct reference string,
the test features should be aligned with it in the manner that
gives the best matching score to prevent time differences from
unduly inﬂuencing the match. On the other hand, constraints
on the matching process prevent unreasonable alignments
from taking place.
