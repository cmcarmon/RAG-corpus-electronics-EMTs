To use the beneﬁts of LNS, a conversion overhead is re-
quired in most cases to perform the forward LNS mapping
deﬁned by equation 1.1. It is noted that conversions of equa-
tions 1.1 and 1.2 are required if an LNS processor receives
input or transmits output linear data in digital format. Since
all arithmetic operations can be performed in the logarithmic
domain, only an initial conversion is imposed; therefore, as the
amount of processing implemented in LNS grows, the contri-
bution of the conversion overhead to power dissipation and to
area–time complexity becomes negligible because it remains
constant.
