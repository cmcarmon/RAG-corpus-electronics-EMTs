A second difference between the common emitter and common base ampliﬁers is that the voltage gain of
the latter displays no phase inversion between source and response voltages. Moreover, for the same load and
source terminations and for identical transistors biased identically, the voltage gain of the common base cell is
likely  to  be  much  smaller  than  that  of  the  common  emitter  unit.  This  contention  is  veriﬁed  by  substituting
Eq. (28.37) into Eq. (28.34) and using Eqs. (28.31), (28.13), and (28.12) to write
