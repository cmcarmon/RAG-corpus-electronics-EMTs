used to indicate signal level on audio equipment, with a modiﬁcation of the position indicator seen in Fig. 83.8
to guide ﬁne tuning. Matrix LED arrays can be used for ﬂexible, high-density panel displays [Fig. 83.9(a)] and
are conventionally controlled by row or column strobing [Fig. 83.9(b)] controlled by a microprocessor interface.
Multiple LEDs are commonly packaged together in a single integrated device, organized in one of the standard
display fonts [Fig. 83.10(a)], with decoding often included within the package [Fig. 83.10(b)]. The 7-segment
