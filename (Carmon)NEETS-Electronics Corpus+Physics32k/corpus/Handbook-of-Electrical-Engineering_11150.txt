In  recent  years  semiconductor  technology  has  been  applied  to  the  design  of  pressure  transducers.  Silicon
strain  gauges  that  are  much  more  sensitive  than  their  wire  counterparts  are  formed  on  a  silicon  chip,  and
micromachining technology is used to form this portion of the chip into a diaphragm with the strain gauges
integrated into its surface. This structure is then incorporated into a plastic housing and dome assembly. The
entire sensor can be fabricated and sold inexpensively so that disposable, single-use devices can be made. These
