A time of flight (TOF) detector is a particle detector which can discriminate between a lighter and a heavier elementary particle of same momentum using their time of flight between two scintillators. The first of the scintillators activates a clock upon being hit while the other stops the clock upon being hit. If the two masses are denoted by




m

1




{\displaystyle m_{1}}
and




m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
and have velocities




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
then the time of flight difference is given by

{\displaystyle \Delta t=L\left({\frac {1}{v_{1}}}-{\frac {1}{v_{2}}}\right)\approx {\frac {Lc}{2p^{2}}}(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})}

where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the distance between the scintillators. The approximation is in the relativistic limit at momentum



p

and



c


{\displaystyle c}
denotes the speed of light in vacuum.
