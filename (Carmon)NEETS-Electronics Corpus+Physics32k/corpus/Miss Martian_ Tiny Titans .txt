In the children's series Tiny Titans, Miss Martian is one of the younger toddlers and part of the "Little Tiny Titans" with Wildebeest and Jericho, often stretching her long, octopus arms to grab objects. She's often seen hugging the older Beast Boy, whom she calls "Bee Bee", due to his ability to turn into a puppy (ironically the opposite relationship of their Young Justice cartoon counterparts).
