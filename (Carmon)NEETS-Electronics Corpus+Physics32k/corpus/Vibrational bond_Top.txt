A vibrational bond is a chemical bond that happens between two very large atoms, like bromine, and a very small atom, like hydrogen, at very high energy states. Vibrational bonds only exist for a few milliseconds. This bond is detectable through modern analytic chemistry and is significant because it affects the rate at which other reactions can occur.
