Taﬂove and Hagness (2000) demonstrated that this theoret-
ical anisotropy of the numerical phase velocity appears in
FDTD simulations. Figure 9.3 presents their modeling results
for a radially outward-propagating sinusoidal cylindrical wave
in a two-dimensional TMz grid. The Taﬂove and Hagness, grid
was conﬁgured with 360  360 square cells with Dx ¼ Dy ¼
D ¼ 1:0. A unity-amplitude sinusoidal excitation was provided
to a single Ez component at the center of the grid. Choosing
a grid-sampling density of Nl ¼ 20 and a Courant factor
S ¼ 0:5 permitted direct comparison of the FDTD modeling
results with the theoretical results for the anisotropy of ~vvp,
discussed immediately above.
