The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the electronic band structure.
The kinetic energy of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the wave vector k, the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an electron in a Fermi gas is given by




E

(

,


{\displaystyle E=E_{0}+{\frac {\left(\hbar k\right)^{2}}{2m}}\ ,}

where m is the electron mass. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily.

For longitudinal phonons in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional k-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by
