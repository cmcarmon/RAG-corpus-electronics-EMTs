The velocity modulation of the beam is merely a means to an end. No useful power has been 
produced at this point. The energy gained by the accelerated electrons is balanced by the energy lost by 
the decelerated electrons. However, a new and useful beam distribution will be formed if the velocity-
modulated electrons are allowed to drift into an area that has no electrostatic field.
