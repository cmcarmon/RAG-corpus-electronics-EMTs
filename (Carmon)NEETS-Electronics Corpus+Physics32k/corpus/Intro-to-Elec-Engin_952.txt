(d) The transformer is operating at a constant
load power factor of 0.85 on this load cycle:
0.85 full load for 8 hours, 0.60 full load for 12
hours, and no load for 4 hours. Compute the
transformer’s all-day (or energy) efﬁciency.
(e) If the transformer is supplying full load at
230 V and 0.8 lagging power factor, de-
termine the voltage regulation of the trans-
former. Also, ﬁnd the power factor at the
high-voltage terminals.
