regions between 4 to 60 GHz. It is also commonly used in
oscillators, mixers, and switches. Due to the excellent noise
properties of the MOSFET, it is often used for sensitive re-
ceivers below 4 GHz. GaAs FETs typically exhibit higher power
gain, lower noise ﬁgure, and higher output capabilities than Si
BJTs above 4 GHz. The idealized geometry of a GaAs FET is
shown in Figure 11.5. Note that the depletion region below the
gate controls the amount of current ﬂowing between the
source and drain. With zero applied bias, the depletion region
will consist of only the built-in potential of the Schottky
barrier. As the gate potential is made negative relative to the
source, the depth of the depletion region increases, with the
effect of increasing channel resistance and reducing current.
Pinch-off occurs when the depletion region reaches the semi-
insulating GaAs substrate.
