All metallic elements are good conductors of electricity, due to the way the atoms bond with
each other. The electrons of the atoms comprising a mass of metal are so uninhibited in their
allowable energy states that they ﬂoat freely between the different nuclei in the substance,
readily motivated by any electric ﬁeld. The electrons are so mobile, in fact, that they are
sometimes described by scientists as an electron gas, or even an electron sea in which the
atomic nuclei rest. This electron mobility accounts for some of the other common properties of
metals: good heat conductivity, malleability and ductility (easily formed into different shapes),
and a lustrous ﬁnish when pure.
