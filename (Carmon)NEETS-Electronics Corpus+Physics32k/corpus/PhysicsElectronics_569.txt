Cheap IC versions of operational ampliﬁers are readily available, making their use popular
in any analog circuit. The cheap models operate from DC to about 20 kHz, while the high-
performance models operate up to 50 MHz. A popular device is the 741 op-amp which drops
oﬀ 6 dB/octave above 5 Hz. Op-amps are usually available as an IC in an 8-pin dual, in-line
package (DIP). Some op-amp ICs have more than one op-amp on the same chip.
