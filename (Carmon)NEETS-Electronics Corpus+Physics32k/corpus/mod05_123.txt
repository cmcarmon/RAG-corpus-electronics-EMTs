You must always observe safety precautions when working around electrical equipment to avoid 
injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Electrical equipment frequently has accessories that require 
separate sources of power. Lighting fixtures, heaters, externally powered temperature detectors, and alarm 
systems are examples of accessories whose terminals must be deenergized. When working on dc 
generators, you must check to ensure that all such circuits have been de-energized and tagged before you 
attempt any maintenance or repair work. You must also use the greatest care when working on or near the 
output terminals of dc generators.
