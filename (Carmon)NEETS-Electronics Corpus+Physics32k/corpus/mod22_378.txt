You also may recall in chapter 2, we talked about the different types of primary storage used in 
computers and how they differ from one another. Some were magnetic in nature, such as magnetic core 
storage; others were electronic, such as semiconductor and bubble storage. For purposes of simplicity, we 
have selected magnetic core storage to show you how data is represented and stored in the computer's 
primary memory.
