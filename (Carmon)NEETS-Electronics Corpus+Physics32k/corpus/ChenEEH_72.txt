The voltage gain Gv at a frequency v of a two-port network is
deﬁned as the ratio of the output voltage phasor to the input
voltage phasor. In a similar manner, the current gain Gi is
deﬁned as the ratio of output current phasor to input current
phasor. Because the phasors are complex quantities that
depend on frequency, the gains, voltages, and currents are
written as G(jv), V (jv), and I(jv). Frequency response is
