Figure 4-11 shows a differential velocity capstan. In this design, the take-up capstan is made a little 
larger than the supply capstan. This causes the take-up capstan to pull the tape away from the heads 
slightly faster than the supply capstan feeds the tape to the heads. The result is a constant tape tension in 
the area around the magnetic heads.
