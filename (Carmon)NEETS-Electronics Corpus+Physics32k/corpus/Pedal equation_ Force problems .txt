Solutions to some force problems of classical mechanics can be surprisingly easily obtained in pedal coordinates.
Consider a dynamical system:

x

{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}=F^{\prime }(|x|^{2})x+2G^{\prime }(|x|^{2}){\dot {x}}^{\perp },}

describing an evolution of a test particle (with position

{\displaystyle x}
and velocity






x

{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}}
) in the plane in the presence of central



F


{\displaystyle F}
and Lorentz like

{\displaystyle L=x\cdot {\dot {x}}^{\perp }+G(|x|^{2}),\qquad c=|{\dot {x}}|^{2}-F(|x|^{2}),}

are conserved in this system.
Then the curve traced by

{\displaystyle {\frac {\left(L-G(r^{2})\right)^{2}}{p^{2}}}=F(r^{2})+c,}

with the pedal point at the origin. This fact was discovered by P. Blaschke in 2017.
