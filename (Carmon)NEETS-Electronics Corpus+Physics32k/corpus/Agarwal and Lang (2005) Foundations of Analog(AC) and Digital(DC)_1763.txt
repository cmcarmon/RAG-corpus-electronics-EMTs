Because the impulse response of the circuit is essentially a homogeneous
response, this response is identical to that studied in Section 12.2. In fact,
Equations 12.63 and 12.64 are identical to Equations 12.152 and 12.153 with
the substitution of zero for vC(0) and −◦/L for iL(0) in the former equations.
Alternatively, we can determine the circuit response to the impulse input by
simply differentiating the step response given in Equations 12.224 and 12.225.
As discussed in Section 12.6, we do this by applying the operator (◦/V◦)d/dt
because the impulse input can be derived by applying the same operator to the
step input as
