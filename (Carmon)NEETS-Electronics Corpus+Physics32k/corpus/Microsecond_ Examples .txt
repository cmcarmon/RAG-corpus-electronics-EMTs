1 microsecond (1 μs) – cycle time for frequency 1 × 106 hertz (1 MHz), the inverse unit. This corresponds to radio wavelength 300 m (AM medium wave band), as can be calculated by multiplying 1 µs by the speed of light (approximately 3.00 × 108 m/s) to determine the distance travelled.
1 microsecond – the length of time of a high-speed, commercial strobe light flash (see air-gap flash).
1.8 microseconds – the amount of time subtracted from the Earth’s day as a result of the 2011 Japanese earthquake.
2 microseconds – the lifetime of a muonium particle
2.68 microseconds – the amount of time subtracted from the Earth’s day as a result of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.
3.33564095 microseconds – the time taken by light to travel one kilometer in a vacuum
4.63 microseconds – a fifth (a 60th of a 60th of a 60th of a second)
5.4 microseconds – the time taken by light to travel one mile in a vacuum (or radio waves point-to-point in a near vacuum)
8.01 microseconds – the time taken by light to travel one mile in typical single mode fiber optic cable
10 microseconds (μs) – cycle time for frequency 100 kHz, radio wavelength 3 km
18 microseconds – net amount per year that the length of the day lengthens, largely due to tidal acceleration.
20.8 microseconds – sampling interval for digital audio with 48,000 samples/s
22.7 microseconds – sampling interval for CD audio (44,100 samples/s)
38 microseconds – discrepancy in GPS satellite time per day (compensated by clock speed) due to relativity
50 microseconds – cycle time for highest human-audible tone (20 kHz)
50 microseconds to read – the access latency for a modern solid state drive which holds non-volatile computer data
100 microseconds (0.1 ms) – cycle time for frequency 10 kHz
125 microseconds – sampling interval for telephone audio (8000 samples/s)
164 microseconds – half-life of polonium-214
240 microseconds – half-life of copernicium-277
250 microseconds – cycle time for highest tone in telephone audio (4 kHz)
277.8 microseconds – a fourth (a 60th of a 60th of a second), used in astronomical calculations by al-Biruni and Roger Bacon in 1000 and 1267 AD, respectively.
489.67 microseconds – time for light at a 1550 nm frequency to travel 100 km in a singlemode fiber optic cable (where speed of light is approximately 200 million meters per second due to its index of refraction).
The average human eye blink takes 350,000 microseconds (just over 1/3 of one second).
The average human finger snap takes 150,000 microseconds (just over 1/7 of one second).
A camera flash illuminates for 1000 microseconds.
Standard camera shutter speed opens the shutter for 4000 microseconds or 4 milliseconds.
