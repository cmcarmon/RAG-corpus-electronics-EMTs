Intercommunication and Interconnect Optimization
A signiﬁcant portion of the power in high performance CMOS
VLSI circuits is dissipated in busses or global communications
(Mehendale et al., 1998; Winzker, 1998). Global communica-
tion typically involves the switching of large capacitive loads,
such as I/O ports and the clock distribution network, that
inherently require signiﬁcant power (Mehendale et al., 1998a;
Stan and Burleson, 1997). Some of the techniques used to
reduce the power dissipation in communication networks
inside a chip include data encoding techniques and low-
swing signaling.
