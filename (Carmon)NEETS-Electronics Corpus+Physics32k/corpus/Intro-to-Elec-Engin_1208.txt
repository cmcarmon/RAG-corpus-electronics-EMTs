When speed control below the base speed is required, the effective armature resistance can be
increased by inserting external resistance in series with the armature. This method can be applied
to shunt, series, or compound motors. It has the disadvantage, however, that the series resistance,
carrying full armature current, will cause signiﬁcant power loss with an associated reduction in
