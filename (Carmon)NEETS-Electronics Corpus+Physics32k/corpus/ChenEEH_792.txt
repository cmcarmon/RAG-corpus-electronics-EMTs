This chapter addresses the reﬁnement steps toward such a
virtual prototype. It is organized as follows. Section 3.2 details
the design process and the levels of abstraction to be covered
in engineering multinature, mixed-mode embedded systems.
Section 3.3 is a short introduction to the main features of the
hardware description language VHDL–AMS (IEEE Standard
1076.1–1999) aimed to represent models for event-discrete
and/or time-continuous operating heterogeneous systems. In
Section 3.4, system modeling and simulation is demonstrated
for an electronic depth gauge to be used by scuba divers. This
application highlights the problems of combining multinature,
mixed mode components into a virtual prototype. Finally,
