Example 4
Sampled uniformly and then time-division multiplexed are 24
voice signals. The sampling operation involved ﬂattop samples
with 1 ms duration. The multiplexing operation includes pro-
vision for synchronization by adding an extra pulse of sufﬁ-
cient amplitude and also 1 ms duration. The highest frequency
component of each voice signal is 3.4 kHz.
