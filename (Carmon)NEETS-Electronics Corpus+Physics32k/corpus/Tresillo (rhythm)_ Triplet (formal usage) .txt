Tresillo is a Spanish word meaning "triplet"â€”three equal notes within the same time span normally occupied by two notes. In its formal usage, tresillo refers to a subdivision of the beat that does not normally occur within the given structure. Therefore, it is indicated by the number 3 (in brackets) as shown below. The top measure divides each beat in three: one, and, ah, two, and, ah. The bottom measure divides the span of two main beats by three (hemiola): one, one-ah, two-and.
