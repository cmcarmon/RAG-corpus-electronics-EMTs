In this equation we see something novel to our experience thusfar with electric circuits: the
variable of time. When relating the quantities of voltage, current, and resistance to a resistor,
it doesn’t matter if we’re dealing with measurements taken over an unspeciﬁed period of time
(E=IR; V=IR), or at a speciﬁc moment in time (e=ir; v=ir). The same basic formula holds true,
because time is irrelevant to voltage, current, and resistance in a component like a resistor.
