Another simple nonlinear circuit, shown in Figure 5.5, is
used to rectify a sinusoidal signal. If the diode is ideal, the
sinusoidal signal propagates unaltered and the current ﬂowing
through the diode is an ideally rectiﬁed sinusoidal signal. The
circuit’s
steady-state response can be found graphically.
The diode is off below the value vs(t ) ¼ Vdd. For values
vs(t )  Vdd the diode is on. Hence,
