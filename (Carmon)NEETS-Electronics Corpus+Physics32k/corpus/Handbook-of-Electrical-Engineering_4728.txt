Thus, as with transmission lines, an intervening layer can be used to match from one transmitting medium to
another.  For  example,  if  the  medium  following  the  layer  is  inÔ¨Ånite  and  of  characteristic  impedance  Z03,  i.e.,
ZL2 = Z03, the interface will look like Z01 to the incident wave if kh = p/2, quarter-wave thickness, and the layer
02 = Z01Z03. This matching, which provides complete power transfer from medium
characteristic impedance is Z2
1  to  medium  3,  is  valid  only  at  the  frequency  for  which kh = p/2.  For  matching  over  a  band  of  frequencies,
multiple matching layers are required.
