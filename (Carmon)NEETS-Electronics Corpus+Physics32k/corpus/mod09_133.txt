Several times in this chapter, we have discussed "ideal" or theoretically perfect circuits. In each case, 
you found that resistance kept our circuits from being perfect. You also found that low resistance in tuners 
was better than high resistance. Now you will learn about a factor that, in effect, measures just how close 
to perfect a tuner or tuner component can be. This same factor affects BANDWIDTH and 
SELECTIVITY. It can be used in figuring voltage across a coil or capacitor in a series-resonant circuit 
and the amount of circulating (tank) current in a parallel-resonant circuit. This factor is very important
