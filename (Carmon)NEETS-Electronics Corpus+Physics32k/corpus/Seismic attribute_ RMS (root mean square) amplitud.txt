A post-stack attribute that computes the square root of the sum of squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. With this root mean square amplitude, one can measure reflectivity in order to map direct hydrocarbon indicators in a zone of interest. However, RMS is sensitive to noise as it squares every value within the window.
