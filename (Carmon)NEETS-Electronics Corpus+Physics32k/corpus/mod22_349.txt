You cannot use all printers for graphics output. They must be capable of producing graphics and also 
be compatible with the software. Some character printers can be used for limited graphics. Dot-matrix 
printers and plotters work well for graphics output. Laser and ink jet printers are also good for both text 
and graphics.
