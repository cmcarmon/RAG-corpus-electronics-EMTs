It is often necessary to check the input and output signal power levels of electronic equipment. The 
determination of dc power is computed by using a derivative of Ohm's law (P = IE = I2R = E 2/R). 
However, the presence of a reactive component in ac circuits means that apparent power is being 
measured or calculated unless the rms voltage-current value is multiplied by a power factor to obtain true 
lower. The measurement of ac power is further complicated by the frequency limitations of various power 
meters. If there is no phase difference, ac power may be computed in the same manner as dc power by 
determining the average value of the product of the voltage and current. In practical ac circuits, the 
apparent power must be multiplied by the cosine of the phase angle between the voltage and current in 
order to compute true power.
