Piezoelectricity
Certain crystals produce charge on their surfaces when strained or conversely become strained when placed in
an  electric  ﬁeld.  Important  piezoelectric  crystals  include  quartz,  ADP,  lithium  sulphate,  rochelle  salt,  and
tourmaline.  Lithium  sulphate  and  tourmaline  are  “volume  expanders,”  that  is,  their  volume  changes  when
subjected  to  an  electric  ﬁeld  in  the  proper  direction.  Such  crystals  can  detect  hydrostatic  pressure  directly.
Crystals which are not volume expanders must have one or more surfaces shielded from the pressure ﬁeld in
order to convert the pressure to a uniaxial strain which can be detected. Tourmaline is relatively insensitive and
used primarily in blast gauges, while quartz is used principally in high Q ultrasonic transducers.
