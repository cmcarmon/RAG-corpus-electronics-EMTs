Data is stored on a hard disk the same way it's stored on a floppy disk, in circular tracks. The total 
number of tracks on a hard disk is set, just like floppy disk, by (1) the number of steps the disk drive's 
magnetic head stepper motor can make, and (2) whether the disk drive has a magnetic head for one or 
both surfaces of the hard disk platter.
