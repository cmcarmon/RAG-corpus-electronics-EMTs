You may not realize it, but you’re probably familiar with many devices that 
really are output transducers. Light bulbs, LEDs, motors, speakers, liquid 
crystal displays (LCDs), and other electronic visual displays all convert elec-
trical energy into some other form of energy. Without these puppies, you 
might create, shape, and send electrical signals around through wires and 
components all day long, and never reap the rich rewards of electronics. It’s 
only when you transform the electrical 
energy into a form of energy you can 
experience (and use) that you begin to 
enjoy the fruits of your labor.
