d=dt is a differential operator, u(t ) 2 Rm is a vector
where DÂ¼
of inputs, j(t ) 2 Rl is a vector of the standard variables called
the partial state variables, and P(D) and Q(D) are differ-
ential operator matrices of compatible dimensions. The vector
of output variables is, in general, represented by a linear,
differential combination of the partial state variables and the
inputs:
