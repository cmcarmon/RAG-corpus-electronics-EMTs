There are circumstances when you may need to analyze a DC reactive circuit when the starting
values of voltage and current are not respective of a fully ”discharged” state. In other words,
the capacitor might start at a partially-charged condition instead of starting at zero volts, and
an inductor might start with some amount of current already through it, instead of zero as we
have been assuming so far. Take this circuit as an example, starting with the switch open and
ﬁnishing with the switch in the closed position:
