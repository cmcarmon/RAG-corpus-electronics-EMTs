Since "For every standard, finite set of natural numbers F there is a natural number g such that g > f for all f in F" â€“ say, g = maximum(F) + 1 â€“ we may use Idealisation to derive "There is a natural number G such that G > f for all standard natural numbers f." In other words, there exists a natural number greater than each standard natural number.
