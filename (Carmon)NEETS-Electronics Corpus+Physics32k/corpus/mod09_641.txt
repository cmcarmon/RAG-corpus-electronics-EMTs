At the end of 200 microseconds, the input voltage again rises suddenly to 100 volts. Since the 
capacitor cannot respond to the 100-volt increase instantaneously, the 100-volt change takes place across 
the resistor. The voltage across the resistor suddenly rises from âˆ’23.3 volts to +76.7 volts. The capacitor 
will now begin to charge for 100 microseconds. The voltage will decrease across the resistor. This charge 
and discharge action will continue for many cycles. Finally, the voltage across the capacitor will rise and 
fall by equal amounts both above and below about a 50-volt level. The resistor voltage will also rise and 
fall by equal amounts to about a 0-volt level.
