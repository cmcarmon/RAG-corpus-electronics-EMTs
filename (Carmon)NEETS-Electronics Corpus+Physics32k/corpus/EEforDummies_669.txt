Over the years, chip makers have come out with lots of different ICs, each of 
which performs a specific function depending on how the components inside 
are wired. Many of the integrated circuits you encounter are so popular they 
have become standardized, and you can find a wealth of information about 
them online and in books. A lot of different chip makers offer these standard-
ized ICs, and manufacturers and hobbyists the world over buy and use them 
in various projects. Other special‐purpose ICs are designed to accomplish 
a unique task. More often than not, only a single company sells a particular 
special‐purpose chip.
