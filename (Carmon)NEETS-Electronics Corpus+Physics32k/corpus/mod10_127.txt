The most complex sound wave that can be produced is noise. Noise has no tonal quality. It distracts
and distorts the sound quality that was intended to be heard. NOISE is generally an unwanted disturbance
caused by spurious waves originating from man-made or natural sources, such as a jet breaking the sound
barrier, or thunder.
