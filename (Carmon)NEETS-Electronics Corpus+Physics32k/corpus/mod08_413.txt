The magnetic amplifier has certain advantages over other types of amplifiers. These include (1) high
efficiency (up to 90 percent); (2) reliability (long life, freedom from maintenance, reduction of spare parts
inventory); (3) ruggedness (shock and vibration resistance, high overload capability, freedom from effects
of moisture); and (4) no warm-up time. The magnetic amplifier has no moving parts and can be
hermetically sealed within a case similar to the conventional dry-type transformer.
