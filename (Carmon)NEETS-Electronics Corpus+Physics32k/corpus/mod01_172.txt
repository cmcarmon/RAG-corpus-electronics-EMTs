Electrical charges are created by the displacement of electrons, so that there exists an excess of
electrons at one point, and a deficiency at another point. Consequently, a charge must always have either
a negative or positive polarity. A body with an excess of electrons is considered to be negative, whereas a
body with a deficiency of electrons is positive.
