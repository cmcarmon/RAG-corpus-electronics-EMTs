Commercial
Multiple Access Communications. From  the  perspective  of  commercial  applications,  probably  the  most
important  use  of  spread  spectrum  communications  is  as  a  multiple  accessing  technique. When  used  in  this
manner, it becomes an alternative to either frequency division multiple access (FDMA) or time division multiple
access (TDMA) and is typically referred to as either code division multiple access (CDMA) or spread spectrum
multiple  access  (SSMA). When  using  CDMA,  each  signal  in  the  set  is  given  its  own  spreading  sequence. As
opposed to either FDMA, wherein all users occupy disjoint frequency bands but are transmitted simultaneously
in time, or TDMA, whereby all users occupy the same bandwidth but transmit in disjoint intervals of time, in
CDMA,  all  signals  occupy  the  same  bandwidth  and  are  transmitted  simultaneously  in  time;  the  different
waveforms in CDMA are distinguished from one another at the receiver by the speciÔ¨Åc spreading codes they
employ.
