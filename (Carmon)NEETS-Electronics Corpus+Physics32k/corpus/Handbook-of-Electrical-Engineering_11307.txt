Clinical Indications
Initially, ICDs were only indicated for certain patients that had survived an episode of cardiac arrest. Time of
intervention  is  critical  to  survival  of  cardiac  arrest;  only  25%  of  people  that  have  an  episode  are  successfully
resuscitated by ﬁrst responders [Shuster and Keller, 1993]. ICDs have decreased the ﬁrst-year mortality rate of
these survivors from 30 to 2% [Winkle et al., 1991]. More recently, in addition to cardiac arrest survivors, patients
deemed at risk for a ﬁrst arrest due to sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias are receiving ICDs as well [Saksena
et al., 1996]. In the future, patients with more subtle predictors of sudden death may be indicated for ICDs.
