Recall that 1 kilohertz is the modulating signal. If the local oscillator frequency should drift to
3,500.5 kilohertz, the IF output of the mixer will become 499.5 kilohertz. The carrier reinsertion
oscillator, however, will still be operating at 500 kilohertz. This will result in an incorrect audio output of
500 hertz rather than the correct original 1-kilohertz tone. Suppose the intelligence transmitted was a
complex signal, such as speech. You would then find the signal unintelligible because of the displacement
of the side frequencies caused by the local oscillator deviation. The local oscillator and carrier reinsertion
oscillator must be extremely stable.
