After	completing	this	chapter,	the	student	will	be	
able	to:
Describe	how	an	AC	voltage	is	produced	with	
an	AC	generator	(alternator).
Define	alternation,	cycle,	hertz,	sine	wave,	
period,	and	frequency.
Identify	the	parts	of	an	AC	generator	
(alternator).
Define	peak,	peak-to-peak,	effective,	and	rms.
Explain	the	relationship	between	time	and	
frequency.
Identify	and	describe	three	basic	nonsinusoidal	
waveforms.
Describe	how	nonsinusoidal	waveforms	consist	
of	the	fundamental	frequency	and	harmonics.
Understand	why	AC	is	used	in	todayâ€™s	society.
Describe	how	an	AC	distribution	system	works.
