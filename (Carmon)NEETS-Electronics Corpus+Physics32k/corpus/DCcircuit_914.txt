â€¢ The other electrode (called the reference electrode) uses a porous junction between the
measured liquid and a stable, neutral pH buffer solution (usually potassium chloride) to
create a zero-voltage electrical connection to the liquid. This provides a point of continuity
for a complete circuit so that the voltage produced across the thickness of the glass in the
measurement electrode can be measured by an external voltmeter.
