In geometry, an angle subtended by an arc, line segment, or other curve is one whose two rays pass through the endpoints of the arc. The precise meaning varies with the context. For example, one may speak of the angle subtended by an arc of a circumference when the angle's vertex is the centre of the circle to which the circumference belongs. A simple theorem of plane geometry states that arcs of equal lengths subtend equal angles in such a situation.
