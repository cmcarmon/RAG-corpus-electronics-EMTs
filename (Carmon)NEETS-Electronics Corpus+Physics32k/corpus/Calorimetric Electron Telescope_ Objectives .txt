The objectives are to understand the following:
origin and mechanisms of acceleration of high-energy cosmic rays and gamma rays
propagation mechanism of cosmic rays throughout the galaxy
identity of dark matter
As a cosmic ray observatory, CALET aims to clarify high energy space phenomena and dark matter from two perspectives; one is particle creation and annihilation in the field of particle physics (or nuclear physics) and the other is particle acceleration and propagation in the field of space physics.
