An injured person may or may not be in pain. The amount of pain felt depends in part on the person's 
physical condition and the type of injury. Extreme pain, if not relieved, can increase the degree of shock. 
Make the victim as comfortable as possible. Fractures should be immobilized and supported. 
Immobilization greatly reduces, and sometimes eliminates, pain. Normally, you should not administer 
drugs, but aspirin may be given for mild pain.
