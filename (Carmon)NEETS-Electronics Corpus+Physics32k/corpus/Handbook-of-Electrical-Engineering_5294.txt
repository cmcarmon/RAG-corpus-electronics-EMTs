Today, the cost of energy delivered by wind plants rivals those obtained from some nonrenewable sources. By
1990, wind became the most utilized and competitive option among all the solar energy technologies for the bulk
power market at a cost of generation of about 8¢/kWh (or roughly 7¢/kWh in 1987 dollars). Ongoing research and
development  work  in  new  design  tools,  advanced  airfoils,  site  tailoring,  operating  strategies,  array  spacing,  and
improved reliability and manufacturability is expected to bring the cost of energy further down by a factor of 2 to 3.
At around 1600 MW, nearly 90% of all the WECS installed in the world are in California. They are expected
to generate nearly 3 billion kWh of electricity per year to the state’s utilities to which they are interconnected.
Although their lack of control and the intermittent nature of wind-derived energy are not embraced enthusiastically
by electric utilities, this gap is expected to be bridged very soon with appropriate computer controls and operating
strategies. Wind energy is already an economical option for remote areas endowed with good wind regimes. The
modularity  of  WECS,  coupled  with  the  associated  environmental  beneﬁts,  potential  for  providing  jobs,  and
economic viability point to a major role for wind energy in the generation mix of the world in the decades to come.
