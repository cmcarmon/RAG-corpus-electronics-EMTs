The Wheeler–DeWitt equation can be derived from a path integral using the gravitational action in the Euclidean quantum gravity paradigm:

{\displaystyle Z=\int _{C}\mathrm {e} ^{-I[g_{\mu \nu },\phi ]}{\mathcal {D}}{\mathbf {g} }\,{\mathcal {D}}\phi }

where one integrates over a class of Riemannian four-metrics and matter fields matching certain boundary conditions. Because the concept of a universal time coordinate seems unphysical, and at odds with the principles of general relativity, the action is evaluated around a 3-metric which we take as the boundary of the classes of four-metrics and on which a certain configuration of matter fields exists. This latter might for example be the current configuration of matter in our universe as we observe it today. Evaluating the action so that it only depends on the 3-metric and the matter fields is sufficient to remove the need for a time coordinate as it effectively fixes a point in the evolution of the universe.
We obtain the Hamiltonian constraint from

{\displaystyle I_{EH}}
is the Einstein-Hilbert action, and



N


{\displaystyle N}
is the lapse function, i.e. the Lagrange multiplier for the Hamiltonian constraint. The demand for this variation of our gravitational action to vanish corresponds, in fact, to the background independence in general relativity. This is purely classical so far. We can recover the Wheeler–DeWitt equation from

where



Σ


{\displaystyle \Sigma }
is the three-dimensional boundary. Observe that this expression vanishes, implying that the functional derivative also vanishes, giving us the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. A similar statement may be made for the diffeomorphism constraint (take functional derivative with respect to the shift functions instead).
