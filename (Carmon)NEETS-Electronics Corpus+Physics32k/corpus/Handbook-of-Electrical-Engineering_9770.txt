UNDAMENTAL IDEAS, CONCEPTS, AND TOOLS developed in system theory have contributed sig-
niﬁcantly to the breakthroughs in aerospace, manufacturing, and medicine, to name a few. In 1990, the
National Academy of Engineering identiﬁed ten outstanding engineering achievements of the preceding
25 years. These feats included ﬁve accomplishments made possible by utilizing modern system theory: Apollo
lunar landings, satellites, computer-based manufacturing, computer axial tomography, and the jumbo jet. At
present,  these  ideas  are  being  extended  to  increase  the  productivity  of  the  manufacturing  sector,  improve
highway  safety,  increase  fuel  efﬁciency  of  automobiles,  and  design  and  produce  environmentally  friendly
products.
