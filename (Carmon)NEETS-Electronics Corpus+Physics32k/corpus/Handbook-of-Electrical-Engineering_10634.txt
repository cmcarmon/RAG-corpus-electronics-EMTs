Another approach involves large-area plasma panels that are self-luminescent due to gas discharges.
With  this  technology,  the  brightness  improves  considerably  over  that  available  from  a  CRT.  Brilliant,
high-resolution images have been achieved in medium screen sizes, but cost remains a problem and there
is still the challenge of expanding the technology to even larger screen sizes.
