If  the  valence  shell  contains  the  maximum 
number  of  electrons  possible  the  electrons  are 
rigidly  bonded  together  and  the  material  has  the 
properties of an insulator. If, however, the valence 
shell  does  not  have 
its  full  complement  of 
electrons, the electrons can be easily loosened from 
their  orbital  bonds,  and  the  material  has  the 
properties associated with an electrical conductor.   
  An isolated silicon atom contains four electrons  
in its valence shell. When silicon atoms combine to 
form  a  solid  crystal,  each  atom  positions  itself 
between four other silicon atoms in such a way that
