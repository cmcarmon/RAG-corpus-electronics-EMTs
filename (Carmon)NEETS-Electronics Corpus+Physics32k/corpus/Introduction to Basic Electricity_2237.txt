The basic meter movement uses the principle of 
the DC motor. It consists of a stationary permanent 
magnet and a moveable coil. When the current flows 
through the coil, the resulting magnetic field reacts 
with the field of the permanent magnet and causes the  
coil to rotate. The greater the current flow through 
the coil, the stronger the magnetic field produced. 
The stronger the magnetic field produced, the greater 
the rotation of the coil. To determine the amount of
