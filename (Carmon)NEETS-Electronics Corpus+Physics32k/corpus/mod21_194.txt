â€¢ SENSITIVE DEVICES. These include all low-power Schottky-barrier and Schottky-TTL
devices; all ECL devices; high input-impedance linear microcircuits; all small-signal transistors
that operate at 500 MHz or higher; all discrete semiconductors that use silicon dioxide to insulate
metal paths over other active areas; MOS or CMOS devices with input diode protection on all
input terminals; junction field-effect transistors; and precision resistive networks.
