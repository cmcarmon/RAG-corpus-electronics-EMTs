LECTRONIC DESIGNERS have placed increasing signiﬁcance on digital devices since the late 1960s.
This  is  due  primarily  to  the  greater  reliability  and  improved  accuracy  gained  when  using  electronic
devices  in  a  two-level  mode  (binary  mode)  as  compared  to  using  electronic  devices  in  a  continuous
mode (analog mode). As silicon integrated circuits (ICs) became denser and more consistently reproducible
over the past few decades, so did digital electronic devices. Today digital circuits and digital systems produced
from digital devices can be found in every walk of life ranging from children’s toys, kitchen appliances, laboratory
instruments, personal and workstation computers to space shuttle and satellite applications.
