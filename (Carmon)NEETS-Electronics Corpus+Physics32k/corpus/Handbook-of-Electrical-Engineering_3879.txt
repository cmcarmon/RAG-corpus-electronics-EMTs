For  an  incoming  plane  wave  which  is  tilted  at  an  angle  q  from  the  normal,  the  relative  phase  difference
between two oscillators is kd sinq, where d is the distance between oscillators and k is the wave number 2p/l
(see Fig. 38.8). For three evenly spaced oscillators, the phase difference between the end oscillators is 2kd sinq.
In general, the end-to-end phase difference for n evenly spaced oscillators is (n â€“ 1)kd sinq. This formulation
is identical to the phase representation in Eq. (38.30) with d  = kd sinq. Therefore, the intensity as a function
of incidence angle q for an evenly spaced array of n elements is
