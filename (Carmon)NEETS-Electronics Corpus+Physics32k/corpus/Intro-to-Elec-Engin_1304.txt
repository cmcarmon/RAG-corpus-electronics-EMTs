By letting T → ∞ for the rectangular pulse train of Figure E14.1.4(a), so that all pulses
vanish except the one centered at t = 0, we would obtain a single rectangular pulse, as shown in
Figure 14.1.4(a). Because f = 1/T → 0 when T → ∞, intuitively, the amplitude lines will
merge to form a continuous plot, as shown in Figure 14.1.4(b). Spectral analysis of nonperiodic
signals involves Fourier transform theory, which goes beyond the scope of this text. Smooth
curves, such as one in Figure 14.1.4(b), suggest that the signal energy is spread over a continuous
frequency range, rather than being concentrated in discrete sinusoidal components. Note that the
amplitude at f = 0 is equal to the net area DA of the nonperiodic signal.
When spectral peaks occur at or near f = 0, and their amplitude spectra become progressively
smaller as frequency increases, such waveforms are known as low-pass signals, for which there
exists a signal bandwidth W such that all signiﬁcant frequency content falls within the range of
0 ≤ f ≤ W . The concept of signal bandwidth plays a signiﬁcant role in signal-processing and
The approximate reciprocal relationship W ∼= 1/D conveys the salient point that long pulses
communication systems. Table 14.1.1 lists the nominal bandwidths of a few selected signals.
