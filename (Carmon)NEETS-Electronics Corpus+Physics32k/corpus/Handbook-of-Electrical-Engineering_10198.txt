Two basic categories of sensors exist to provide feedback information: noncontact sensors and contact sensors.
Noncontact sensors include arc-sensing systems and machine vision systems. The former, also referred to as a
through-the-arc system, uses feedback measurements via the arc itself. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, measurements for feedback
may be the current (constant-voltage welding) or the voltage (constant-current welding) obtained by program-
ming the robot to perform a weave pattern. The motion results in measurements that are interpreted as vertical
and cross-seam position. Adaptive positioning is possible by regulating the arc length (constant-current systems)
as irregularities in gaps or edge variations are encountered.
