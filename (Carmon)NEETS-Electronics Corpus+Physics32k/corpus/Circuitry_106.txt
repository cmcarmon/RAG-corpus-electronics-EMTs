Capacitor specifications 
 
The  specifications  for  a  capacitor  usually  include 
the value of capacitance (expressed in microfarads, 
nanofarads  or  picofarads),  the  voltage  rating  (i.e. 
the  maximum  voltage  which  can  be  continuously 
applied  to  the  capacitor  under  a  given  set  of 
conditions),  and  the  accuracy  or  tolerance  (quoted 
as  the  maximum  permissible  percentage  deviation 
from the marked value).  
  Other  practical  considerations  when  selecting 
capacitors for use in a particular application include 
temperature  coefficient,  leakage  current,  stability 
and ambient temperature range.  
  Table  2.5  summarizes  the  properties  of  five  of 
the  most  common  types  of  capacitor.  Note  that 
electrolytic  capacitors  require  the  application  of  a 
polarizing  voltage  in  order  to  the  chemical  action 
on  which 
their  operation.  
  The  polarizing  voltages  used  for  electrolytic 
capacitors can range from as little as 1 V to several 
hundred volts depending upon the working voltage 
rating for the component in question.  
  Figure 2.25 shows some typical non-electrolytic 
capacitors 
(including  polyester,  polystyrene, 
ceramic  and  mica  types)  whilst  Fig.  2.26  shows  a 
selection  of  electrolytic  (polarized)  capacitors.  An 
air-spaced variable capacitor is shown later in Fig. 
2.34 on page 38.
