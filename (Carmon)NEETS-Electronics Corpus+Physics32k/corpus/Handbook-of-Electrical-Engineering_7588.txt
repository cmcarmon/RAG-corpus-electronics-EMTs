Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Logic
Metal-oxide  semiconductor  (MOS)  technology  is  prevalent  in  LSI  systems  due  to  the  high  circuit  densities
possible  with  these  devices.  p-Channel  MOS  was  used  in  the  Ô¨Årst  LSI  systems,  and  it  still  is  the  cheapest  to
produce  because  of  the  higher  yields  achieved  due  to  the  longer  experience  with  PMOS  technology.  PMOS,
however, is largely being replaced by NMOS (n-channel MOS), which has the advantages of being faster (since
electrons  have  greater  mobility  than  holes)  and  having  TTL  compatibility.  In  addition,  NMOS  has  a  higher
function/chip area density than PMOS, the highest density in fact of any of the current technologies. Use of
NMOS and PMOS, however, is limited to LSI and VLSI fabrications. The only MOS logic available as SSI and
MSI is CMOS (complementary MOS).
