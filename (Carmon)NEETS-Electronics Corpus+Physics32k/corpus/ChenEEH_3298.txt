4. Power ﬂow solutions may fail to exist at high loading
conditions, such as when P > Pmax in Figure 7.10. The
loading value Pmax beyond which power ﬂow solutions
do not exist is called the static limit in the power
literature. Because power ﬂow solutions denote the
steady-state operating conditions in our formulation,
lack of power ﬂow solutions implies that it is not
possible to transfer power from the generator to the
load in a steady-state fashion, and the dynamic inter-
actions of the generators and the loads become signiﬁ-
cant. Operating the power system at loading conditions
