Why voltage needs to be different
A voltage is simply a difference in electrical charge between two points. In a 
battery, negatively charged atoms (atoms with an abundance of electrons) 
build up on one of two metal plates, and positively charged atoms (atoms 
with a dearth of electrons) build up on the other metal plate, creating a 
voltage across the plates. (See Figure 1-5.) If you provide a conductive path 
between the metal plates, you enable excess electrons to travel from one 
plate to the other, and current will flow in an effort to neutralize the charges. 
The electromotive force that compels current to flow when the circuit is com-
pleted is created by the difference between charges at the battery terminals.

direct current from a battery.”)
