If (P44 + P12 – P11) and P11 have the same sign or 2/3 * (P44 + P12 – P11) * > P11 then the maximum sensitivity
direction occurs along <111>. If (P44 + P12 – P11) = 0 the longitudinal effect is isotropic and equal to P11 in
all directions, otherwise it occurs along a crystal axis. The maximum sensitivity directions are shown in Fig. 51.2
for Si and Ge.
