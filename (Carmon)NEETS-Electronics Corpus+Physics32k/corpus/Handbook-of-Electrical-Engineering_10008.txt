The  limit-cycle  amplitude  predicted  by  the  DF  is  an  approximation  to  the  fundamental  harmonic.  The
accuracy of this prediction cannot be assessed by using the peak value of the limit cycle to estimate an equivalent
sinusoid. It is possible to estimate the limit cycle more accurately by balancing more harmonics, as mentioned
earlier. Although this is difÔ¨Åcult algebraically other than with loops whose nonlinearity is mathematically simply
described,  for  example  a  cubic,  software  is  available  for  this  purpose  [McNamara  and Atherton,  1987].  The
procedure  involves  solving  sets  of  nonlinear  algebraic  equations  but  good  starting  guesses  can  usually  be
obtained for the magnitudes and phases of the other harmonic components from the wave form fedback to
the nonlinearity, assuming its input is the DF solution.
