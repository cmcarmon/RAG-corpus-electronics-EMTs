For a continuous wave (CW) radar, the transmitter is operated
continuously rather than pulsed. A CW radar can obtain the
target speed by measuring the Doppler frequency. Consider a
CW radar with frequency f0 and a target with a relative velocity
vr with respect to the radar. The Doppler shift of the received
signal is given by:
