Memory and Registers
All  computers  will  have  data  stored  in  memory  and
some space in the CPU for manipulating data. Memory
can be considered to be a long list of bytes (8-bit data
blocks) with addresses (locations in the list) spanning
some  large  range  of  numbers  from  0  to  typically  4
billion (4 GB). The memory is constructed physically
by  grouping  chips  so  that  they  appear  to  form  enor-
mously deep columns of bytes, as shown in Fig. 87.1.
Since  each  column  can  deliver  one  byte  on  each
request,  the  number  of  adjacent  columns  determines
the  number  of  bytes  which  may  be  obtained  from  a
single request. Machines today have 1, 2, 4, or 8 such
columns.  (Some  machines,  the  68000  being  our  cur-
rent example, have only 2 columns but arrange to have
the CPU ask for two successive transfers to get a total
of 4 bytes.) In general, the CPU may manipulate in a
single step a datum as wide as the memory. For all of
the  machines  which  we  will  consider,  that  maximum
datum  size  is  32  bits  or  4  bytes.  While  convention  would  have  us  call  this  biggest  datum  a  word,  historical
reason has led both the VAX and MC68000 to call it a longword. Then, 2 bytes is either a halfword or a word.
We will use the VAX/68000 notation (longword, word, and byte) wherever possible to simplify the reading. To
load data from memory, the CPU sends the address and the datum size to the memory and gets the datum as
the reply. To store data, the address is sent and then the datum and datum size.
