As can be seen from Fig. 95.3, the interconnection networks play a very important role in parallel processors.
The network usually provides a uniform interconnection among PEs on one hand and PEs and MUs on the
other.  Different  array  processor  organizations  might  use  different  interconnection  networks.  In  general,  the
interconnection networks can be classiÔ¨Åed into two categories: static and dynamic, as shown in Fig. 95.4.
