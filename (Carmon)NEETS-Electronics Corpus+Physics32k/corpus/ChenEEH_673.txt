plane that contains data needed in a particular address cycle.
If possible, the data used in successive cycles should also come
from the same plane because activating a new plane takes up a
signiﬁcant amount of extra precharge power. An example ﬂoor
plan in Figure 2.6 is drawn for k ¼ 8 and B ¼ 4. The memory
matrix can be split up in two or more parts to reduce the
length of the word lines also by a factor 2 or more. This results
in a typically heavily partitioned ﬂoor plan (Itoh, 1997) as
shown in a simpliﬁed form in Figure 2.7.
