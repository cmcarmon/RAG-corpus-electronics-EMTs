The ICs discussed in this chapter will be strictly the D/A and A/D conversion circuits. Table 32.1 lists a small
sample of the variety of the D/A and A/D converters currently available. The ICs usually perform either D/A
or A/D  conversion.  There  are  serial  interface  ICs,  however,  typically  for  high-performance  audio  and  digital
signal processing applications, that perform both A/D and D/A processes.
