Problems 
 
18.1   In relation to a PIC  microcontroller, briefly 
explain the meaning of the following terms: 
 
(a)  Flash memory 
 
(b)  Harvard architecture 
 
 
(c)  RISC 
(d)  Sleep function 
 
 
(e)  IDE. 
18.2  Explain,  with  the  aid  of  a  diagram,  how  a 
 
PIC  can  be  programmed  without  having  to 
 
remove it from the target system 
18.3  Sketch a diagram to show the five stages in 
PIC  software  development  cycle.  Explain 
 
why  it  is  usually  necessary  to  follow  this 
 
 
process  
fully 
 
functional  program is obtained. 
18.4  Explain  how  the  PIC  application  circuit 
shown in Fig. 18.4 is automatically reset on 
 
 
power-up  (Hint:  the  MCLR  input  needs  to 
 
be taken low in order to reset the PIC). 
18.5   Show  how  the  PIC  application  shown  in
