End users can also measure fiber attenuation and cable plant transmission loss using an optical power
meter and a stabilized light source. End users use this measurement technique when optical time-domain
reflectometry is not recommended. Measurements obtained with a stabilized light source and power meter
are more accurate than those obtained with an OTDR. Measuring fiber attenuation and transmission loss
using a power meter and light source requires access to both ends of the fiber or link. An optical loss test
set (OLTS) combines the power meter and source functions into one physical unit.
Q25. Is it essential for end users to remeasure optical fiber geometrical properties after installation in
