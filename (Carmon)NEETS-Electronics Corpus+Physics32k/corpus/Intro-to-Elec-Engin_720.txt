Ampliﬁer circuits can be treated conveniently as building blocks when analyzing larger
systems. The ampliﬁer block may be represented by a simple small-signal model. A multistage
ampliﬁer is a system obtained by connecting several ampliﬁer blocks in sequence or cascade, in
which the individual ampliﬁer blocks are called stages. Input stages are designed to accept signals
coming from various sources; intermediate stages provide most of the ampliﬁcation; output stages
drive various loads. Most of these stages fall in the category of small-signal ampliﬁers.
