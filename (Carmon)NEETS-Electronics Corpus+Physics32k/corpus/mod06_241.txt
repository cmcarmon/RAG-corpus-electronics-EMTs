In the discussion of triodes, we only considered the effects of the external circuit on the passage of
current through the tube. The behavior of the electron stream in a conducting tube is also influenced by
the physical structure of the tube. The effects that the physical structure of a tube has on the tubeâ€™s
operation are collectively called TUBE CONSTANTS. Four of the most important of these tube
constants are: TRANSIENT TIME, INTERELECTRODE CAPACITANCE,
TRANSCONDUCTANCE, and AMPLIFICATION FACTOR.
