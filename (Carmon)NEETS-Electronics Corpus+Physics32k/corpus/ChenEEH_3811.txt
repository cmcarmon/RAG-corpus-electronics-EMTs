Provided that aliasing is avoided, the sampled signal has to
be processed by a two-dimensional low-pass ﬁlter to obtain the
image signal back into its analog form. This ﬁlter should
ideally have a transfer function with an amplitude spectrum
equal to one in the support region of the Fourier transform of
the original image and zero outside that region.
