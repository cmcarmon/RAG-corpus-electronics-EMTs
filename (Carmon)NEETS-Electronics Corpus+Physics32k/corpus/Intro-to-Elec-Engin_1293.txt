Periodic Signals and Fourier Series
In the study of analog systems, predicting the response of circuits to a general time-varying voltage
or current waveform x(t) is a difÔ¨Åcult task. However, if x(t) can be expressed as a sum of sinusoids,
then the principle of superposition can be invoked on linear systems and the frequency response
of the circuit can be utilized to expedite calculations. Expressing a signal in terms of sinusoidal
components is known as spectral analysis. Let us begin here by considering the Fourier-series
expansion of periodic signals, which has been introduced in Section 3.1.
