Parts Placement
Proper parts placement not only places the parts within an acceptable window relative to the solder pad pattern
on  the  substrate,  but  the  placement  machine  will  apply  enough  downward  pressure  on  the  part  to  force  it
halfway into the solder paste as well (Fig. 26.10a and 26.10b). This assures both that the part will sit still when
the board is moved, and that coplanarity offsets within limits will still result in an acceptable solder joint. The
effects of coplanarity can be done mathematically by considering:
