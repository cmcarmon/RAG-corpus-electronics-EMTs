The next step is to calculate the time constant of the circuit: the amount of time it takes
for voltage or current values to change approximately 63 percent from their starting values to
their ﬁnal values in a transient situation. In a series RC circuit, the time constant is equal
to the total resistance in ohms multiplied by the total capacitance in farads. For a series L/R
circuit, it is the total inductance in henrys divided by the total resistance in ohms. In either
case, the time constant is expressed in units of seconds and symbolized by the Greek letter
”tau” (τ ):
