. Synchronous transmission. In this technique, all charac-
ters are blocked together and transmitted without a gap
between two characters being transmitted. It requires
more complicated hardware to handle buffering and
blocking, but this hardware more efﬁcient. For example,
assume that there are 240 characters and 3 SYN char-
acters in one block. Then the number of data bits
¼ 240  8 ¼ 1920 bits, the number of SYN character
bits ¼ 3 8¼ 24 bits, and efﬁciency ¼ 1920=1944 99%
variable efﬁciency; the larger the block is, the higher the
efﬁciency.
