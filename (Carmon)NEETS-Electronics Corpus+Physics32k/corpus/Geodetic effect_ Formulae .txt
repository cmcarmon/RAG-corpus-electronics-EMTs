To derive the precession, assume the system is described by a Schwarzschild metric, but expressed in rotating coordinates. The standard (static) Schwarzschild metric is

where we have set  c = G = 1 in order to unclutter the notation.
We introduce a rotating coordinate system, with an angular velocity



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
, such that a satellite in a circular orbit in the θ = π/2 plane remains at rest. This is achieved by substituting

{\displaystyle d\phi =d\phi '-\omega \,dt.}

in the Schwarzschild metric above. In this coordinate system, an observer at radial position r sees a vector positioned at r as rotating with angular frequency ω. This observer, however, sees a vector positioned at some other value of r as rotating at a different rate, due to relativistic time dilation. Transforming the Schwarzschild metric into the rotating frame with the above substitution, and assuming that



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is a constant, we find

{\displaystyle \beta =\sin ^{2}(\theta )}
. For a body orbiting in the θ = π/2 plane, we will have β = 1, and the body's world-line will maintain constant spatial coordinates for all time. Now, the metric is in the canonical form

where the last equality is true only for free falling observers for which there is no acceleration, and thus

This is essentially Kepler's law of periods, which happens to be relativistically exact when expressed in terms of the time coordinate t of this particular rotating coordinate system. In the rotating frame, the satellite remains at rest, but an observer aboard the satellite sees the gyroscope's angular momentum vector precessing at the rate ω. This observer also sees the distant stars as rotating, but they rotate at a slightly different rate due to time dilation. Let τ be the gyroscope's proper time. Then

The −2m/r term is interpreted as the gravitational time dilation, while the additional −m/r is due to the rotation of this frame of reference. Let α' be the accumulated precession in the rotating frame. Since
