Voltage and turns ratio 
 
The  principle  of  the  transformer  is  illustrated  in 
Fig. 4.21. The primary and secondary windings are 
wound on a common low-reluctance magnetic core. 
The  alternating  flux  generated  by  the  primary 
winding  is  therefore  coupled  into  the  secondary 
winding (very little flux escapes due to leakage). A 
sinusoidal  current  flowing  in  the  primary  winding 
produces a sinusoidal flux. At any instant the flux 
in the transformer is given by the equation:
