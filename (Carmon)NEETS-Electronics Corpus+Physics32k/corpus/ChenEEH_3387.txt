Figure 8.1(A) illustrates a standard scenario. Assume a simple
system with a nominal frequency of 60 Hz and a 100 MW unit is
operating with a 5% droop. The regulation constant is calcu-
lated to be R ¼ 0:05(60=100) ¼ 0:03 Hz=MW. If the generator
unit senses a drop in frequency of 0.6 Hz, then this corresponds
to a 20 MW increase in power output. In addition to governor
actions, many loads are frequency sensitive (e.g., motors). For
these loads, the load will decrease as the frequency drops so that
the needed increase from the generators is less. This can be
expressed as:
