Often, because of the goal that moves physical metamaterial inclusions (or cells) to smaller sizes, discussion and implementation of lumped LC circuits or distributed LC networks are often examined. Lumped circuit elements are actually microscopic elements that effectively approximate their larger component counterparts. For example, circuit capacitance and inductance can be created with split rings, which are on the scale of nanometers at optical frequencies. The distributed LC model is related to the lumped LC model, however the distributed element model is more accurate but more complex than the lumped element model.
