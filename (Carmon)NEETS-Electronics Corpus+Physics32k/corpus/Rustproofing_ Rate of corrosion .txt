The rate at which vehicles corrode is dependent upon:
Local climate and use of ice-melting chemicals (salt) upon the roads
Atmospheric pollution, such as acid rain or salt spray, which can cause paint damage
Quality, thickness, and composition of metal used, often an alloy of mild steel
Improper use of some dissimilar metals, which can accelerate the rusting of steel bodywork through electrolytic corrosion
Design of "rust traps" (nooks and crannies that collect road dirt and water)
Particular process of rustproofing used
Plastic/under-seal protection on the car underside
Exposure to salt water, which strips off the protective paint and also causes rust much quicker than ordinary rain water would
