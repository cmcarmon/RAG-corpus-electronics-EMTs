In addition to the desirable properties that spread spectrum signals display over multipath channels, there
are two other reasons why such signals are of interest in cellular-type applications. The Ô¨Årst has to do with a
concept known as the reuse factor. In conventional cellular systems, either analog or digital, in order to avoid
excessive interference from one cell to its neighbor cells, the frequencies used by a given cell are not used by
its immediate neighbors (i.e., the system is designed so that there is a certain spatial separation between cells
that use the same carrier frequencies). For CDMA, however, such spatial isolation is typically not needed, so
that so-called universal reuse is possible.
