The arithmetic logic circuitry is basically a binary 
adder. Both addition and subtraction can be done with 
the binary adder as well as logic operations. To add 
two binary numbers, one number is stored in the ac-
cumulator register and the other is stored in the data 
register. The sum of the two numbers is then placed in 
the accumulator register, replacing the original binary 
number.
