The circuit shown in figure 4-11, view (A), is a PARALLEL-POSITIVE LIMITER WITH 
POSITIVE BIAS. The positive terminal of the battery is connected to the cathode of the diode. This 
causes the diode to be reverse biased at all times except when the input signal is more positive than the 
bias voltage (T1 to T2), as shown in view (B).
