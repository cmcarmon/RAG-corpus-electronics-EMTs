In March 2017, an updated seismic hazard forecast, which like the 2016 version included the risk from induced earthquakes, was released by the United States Geological Survey. The new forecast incorporated earthquakes that occurred in 2016. In 2017 earthquake activity decreased dramatically over the past several years, with 294 magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes recorded in the state by mid-December. This was less than half the number of similar magnitude quakes recorded in 2016. A correlation between numerous waste water injection sites being closed or forced to reduce the volume of injection was reported by USGS geologists to have a direct link to the reduction in earthquakes.
