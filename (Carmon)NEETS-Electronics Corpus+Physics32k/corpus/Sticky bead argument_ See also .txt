Dashpot, of which the sticky-bead device is a variant.
Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave and monochromatic gravitational plane wave, for a modern account of two exact solutions, which should clarify the point that confused Einstein and Rosen in 1936.
pp-wave spacetime, for the Brinkmann gravitational wave solutions.
Gravitational plane wave, for the Baldwin–Jeffery gravitational plane wave solutions.
Brinkmann coordinates and Rosen coordinates for the two coordinate charts.
Beck vacuums, for the Beck or Einstein–Rosen family of vacuum solutions.
Cooperstock's Energy Localization Hypothesis, for a conflicting hypothesis (potentially, therefore, a test).
