Realizable ﬁlters require a nonzero bandwidth for the tran-
sition between the passband and the required out-of-band
attenuation. This is called the transition bandwidth. To min-
imize the system sample rate, we desire that the antialiasing
ﬁlter has a small transition bandwidth. Filter complexity and
cost rise sharply with narrower transition bandwidth, so a
