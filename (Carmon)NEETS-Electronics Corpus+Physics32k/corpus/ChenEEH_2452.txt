plane (ideally of inÔ¨Ånite size) is used, with respect to which the
excitation voltage is applied to the half structure. The half
structure for a regular dipole antenna is called a monopole
antenna, in reference to the presence of only one physical side.
A similar half structure for a folded dipole antenna is called a
folded monopole antenna. The presence of the ground plane
allows the monopole antenna to operate as electrically equiva-
lent to a dipole antenna. The ground plane equivalently re-
places the lower half by an imaging principle, similar to
creating an optical image through a mirror. Notice in Figure
6.14 that for the currents in the monopole and dipole struc-
tures to be the same, one needs the source voltage of the
equivalent dipole antenna to be twice that of the monopole
antenna. As a result, the input impedance of the monopole
structure is half that of the corresponding dipole structure:
