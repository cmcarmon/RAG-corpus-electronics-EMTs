The RLL method of encoding digital data onto a disk is actually a refinement of the MFM encoding 
method. As its name implies, RLL limits the run length (distance) between pulses (also called flux 
reversals) on a hard disk. The basic theory of RLL encoding is that you can store more data in less space 
if you reduce the number of flux reversals (or pulses) that you must record.
