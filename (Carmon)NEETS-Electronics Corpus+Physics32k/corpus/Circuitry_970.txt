We  can  plot  this  information  on  a  graph  showing 
power,  P, on  the  vertical  axis  plotted  against 
current, I, on the horizontal axis. In this case, P is 
the  dependent  variable  and  I is  the  independent 
variable. The graph is shown in Fig. A8.11. 
It can be seen that the relationship between P and 
 
I in Fig. A8.11 is far from linear. The relationship 
is,  in  fact,  a  square  law  relationship. We  can 
actually deduce this from what we know about the 
power  dissipated  in  a  circuit  and  the  current 
flowing in the circuit. You may recall that:
