FIGURE 45.2 Raw and smoothed FLOP (ï¬‚oating-point operation) rates of mainframe computers and smoothed rate-of-
change in speed, at year of introduction from the UNIVAC-1 to the projected performance of an advanced parallel system
at year 2000. Future growth is increasingly dependent on computer architecture, requiring increasing parallelism as improve-
ments due to component performance reach physical speed limits.
