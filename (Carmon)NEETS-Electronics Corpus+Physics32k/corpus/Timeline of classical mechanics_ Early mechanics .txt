4th century BC - Aristotle founds the system of Aristotelian physics, which was later largely disproved
4th century BC - Babylonian astronomers calculate Jupiters position using the mean speed theorem
260 BC - Archimedes works out the principle of the lever and connects buoyancy to weight
60 - Hero of Alexandria writes Metrica, Mechanics (on means to lift heavy objects), and Pneumatics (on machines working on pressure)
350 - Themistius states, that static friction is larger than kinetic friction
6th century - John Philoponus says that by observation, two balls of very different weights will fall at nearly the same speed. He therefore tests the equivalence principle
1021 - Al-Biruni uses three orthogonal coordinates to describe point in space
1000-1030 - Alhazen and Avicenna develop the concepts of inertia and momentum
1100-1138 - Avempace develops the concept of a reaction force
1100-1165 - Hibat Allah Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdaadi discovers that force is proportional to acceleration rather than speed, a fundamental law in classical mechanics
1121 - Al-Khazini publishes The Book of the Balance of Wisdom, in which he develops the concepts of gravity at-a-distance. He suggests that the gravity varies depending on its distance from the center of the universe, namely Earth
1340-1358 - Jean Buridan develops the theory of impetus
14th century - Oxford Calculators and French collaborators prove the mean speed theorem
1500-1528 - Al-Birjandi develops the theory of "circular inertia" to explain Earth's rotation
1581 - Galileo Galilei notices the timekeeping property of the pendulum
1589 - Galileo Galilei uses balls rolling on inclined planes to show that different weights fall with the same acceleration
1638 - Galileo Galilei publishes Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences (which were materials science and kinematics) where he develops, amongst other things, Galilean transformation
1645 - IsmaÃ«l Bullialdus argues that "gravity" weakens as the inverse square of the distance
1651 - Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi discover the Coriolis effect
1658 - Christiaan Huygens experimentally discovers that balls placed anywhere inside an inverted cycloid reach the lowest point of the cycloid in the same time and thereby experimentally shows that the cycloid is the tautochrone
1668 - John Wallis suggests the law of conservation of momentum
1676-1689 - Gottfried Leibniz develops the concept of vis viva, a limited theory of conservation of energy
