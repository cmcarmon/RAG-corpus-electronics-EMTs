IC time machine: the 555 timer
One of the most popular and easy‐to‐use integrated circuits is the versatile 
555 timer, introduced in 1971 and still in wide use today, with more than one 
billion units produced every year. This little workhorse can be used for a 
variety of functions in both analog and digital circuits, most commonly for 
timing (ranging from microseconds to hours), and is the cornerstone of many 
projects you can build (as you see in Chapter 17).
