Consider car traffic on a highway, with just one lane for simplicity. Somewhat surprisingly, and in a tribute to its effectiveness, continuum mechanics effectively models the movement of cars via a partial differential equation (PDE) for the density of cars. The familiarity of this situation empowers us to understand a little of the continuum-discrete dichotomy underlying continuum modelling in general.
To start modelling define that:



x


{\displaystyle x}
measure distance (in km) along the highway;



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time (in minutes);



œÅ
(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle \rho (x,t)}
is the density of cars on the highway (in cars/km in the lane); and



u
(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle u(x,t)}
is the flow velocity (average velocity) of those cars 'at' position



x


{\displaystyle x}
.
