A typical skew specification might read "+/ -  0.15 microseconds between adjacent tracks on the
same head stack at 120 inches per second." This means that one of the tracks on a magnetic head could
lead, or lag, the track next to it by as much as 0.15 microseconds at 120 ips. This specification applies to
both fixed and dynamic skew.
