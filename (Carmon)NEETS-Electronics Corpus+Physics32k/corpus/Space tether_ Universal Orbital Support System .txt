A theoretical type of non-rotating tethered satellite system, it is a concept for providing space-based support to things suspended above an astronomical object. The orbital system is a coupled mass system wherein the upper supporting mass (A) is placed in an orbit around a given celestial body such that it can support a suspended mass (B) at a specific height above the surface of the celestial body, but lower than (A).
