Knowing how voltage and current can harm you
You’ve seen the signs: WARNING! HIGH VOLTAGE. So you might think that 
voltage is what causes harm to the human body, but it’s actually current that 
inflicts the damage. So why the warning signs? That’s because the higher the 
voltage, the more current can flow for an equal amount of resistance. And 
because your body is like a giant resistor, you should shy away from high 
voltages.
