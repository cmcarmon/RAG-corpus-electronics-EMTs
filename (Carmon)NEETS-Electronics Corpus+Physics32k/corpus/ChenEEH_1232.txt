interconnects are largely determined by ﬂoor planning, it be-
comes critical for ﬂoor planning engines to be able to handle
efﬁcient interconnect planning and optimizations so that the
overall timing and design convergence can be achieved. Due to
the inherent complexity of the interconnect driven ﬂoor plan-
ning (IDFP) problem, designers use multistage, adaptive cost
functions in IDFP to gradually consider more interconnect
optimization, planning, and/or global routing features. Using
the adaptive cost functions gives designers ﬂexibility to tune
for different design objectives and to trade-off between per-
formance and run time. They use a simulated annealing algo-
rithm to achieve this ﬂow.
