Active  microwave  devices  can  be  fabricated  as  two-terminal  devices  (diodes)  or  three-terminal  devices
(transistors).  Generally,  three-terminal  devices  are  preferred  for  most  applications  since  the  third  terminal
provides a convenient means to control the RF performance of the device. The third terminal allows for inherent
isolation between the input and output RF circuit. Ampliﬁers and oscillators can easily be designed by providing
circuits  with  proper  stabilization  or  feedback  characteristics. Ampliﬁers  and  oscillators  can  also  be  designed
using two-terminal devices (diodes), but input/output isolation is more difﬁcult to achieve since only one RF
port is available. In this case it is generally necessary to use RF isolators or circulators.
