Imagine a rocket at rest in space with no forces exerted on it (Newton's First Law of Motion). From the moment its engine is started (clock set to 0) the rocket expels gas mass at a constant mass flow rate p (kg/s) and at exhaust velocity relative to the rocket ve (m/s). This creates a constant force propelling the rocket that is equal to p × ve. The mass of fuel the rocket initially has on board is equal to m0 – mf. The mass flow rate is defined as the total wet mass of the rocket over the combustion time of the rocket, so it will therefore take a time that is equal to (m0 – mf)/p to burn all this fuel. Now, the rocket is subject to a constant force (M × ve), but at the same time its total weight is decreasing steadily because it's expelling gas. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, this can have only one consequence; its acceleration is increasing steadily. To obtain the acceleration, the propelling force has to be divided by the rocket's total mass. So, the level of acceleration at any moment (t) after ignition and until the fuel runs out is given by;

{\displaystyle ~{\frac {pv_{e}}{m_{0}-(pt)}}.}

Since speed is the definite integration of acceleration, and the integration has to start at ignition (t=0) and end the moment the last propellant leaves the rocket (tfinal= (m0 – mf)/p), the following definite integral yields the speed at the moment the fuel runs out;
