from a ﬁnite number of electrodes represents a sampling of the spatial activity over the scalp. Consequently,
the remaining values of the map located outside the electrode positions must be estimated from this sampled
activity. One technique for deriving these values is linear interpolation. In the case of a four-point interpolation,
the map is divided into boxes whose corners are deﬁned by real data. The interpolated points within the boxes
are calculated by the weighted sum of the four real data points, based on their distance from the interpolated
point. Although linear interpolation is the most popular technique, polynomial regression and surface spline
interpolation have been employed as alternative procedures. These methods reduce the discontinuities inherent
in linear interpolation and offer better estimates of extreme values. Polynomial regression has the additional
advantage  of  permitting  quantitative  comparisons  between  maps  by  taking  into  account  the  topographic
information represented in the map.
