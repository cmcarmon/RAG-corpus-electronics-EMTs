Although there are a few IC testers on the market, their applications are limited. Just as transistors
must be removed from the circuit to be tested, some ICs must also be removed to permit testing. When
ICs are used in conjunction with external components, the external components should first be checked
for proper operation. This is particularly important in linear applications where a change in the feedback
of a circuit can adversely affect operating characteristics of the component.
