Packet Dropping
Under congestion, some packets need to be dropped by the
routers. In the past, this was done at random,
leading to
inefﬁcient performance for multimedia trafﬁc. For example,
an MPEG-encoded packet stream contains I, P, and B frames.
The I frames are compressed without using any temporal
redundancy between frames, while the P and B frames are
constructed using motion vectors from I (or P) frames. Thus
the packets containing I frames are more important than those
containing P or B frames. When it comes to packet dropping,
the network should give higher dropping priority to the P and
B frames than the I frame packets. For a survey on the different
packet dropping schemes, refer to Labrador and Banerjee
(1999).
