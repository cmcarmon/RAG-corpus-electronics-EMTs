The practice of multilateral exchange can be a mere convenience, but once a common unit of account is agreed, the extent to which members can draw credit limited, a mutual credit system quickly resembles a money system. However, mutual credit is not one of the recognised schools of economic thought, perhaps because its egalitarian implication makes it politically unacceptable.
Even so, Keynes proposed a mutual credit system called International Clearing Union instead of a gold standard, but it was rejected, likely because equal relations and payable debts would have reduced American leverage over the global economy.
The ideas can, however, be found in mutualism, which does value equitable exchange and cooperation.
