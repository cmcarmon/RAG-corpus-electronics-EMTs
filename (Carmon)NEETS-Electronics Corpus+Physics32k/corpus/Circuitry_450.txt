Eventually, the output voltage will have fallen to a 
value that causes the polarity of the voltage at the 
non-inverting input of IC2 to change from positive 
to  negative.  At  this  point,  the  output  of  IC2  will 
rapidly  fall  to  2VCC. Again,  this  voltage  will  be 
passed, via R, to IC1. Capacitor, C, will then start 
to  charge  in  the  other  direction  and  the  output 
voltage of IC1 will begin to rise.  
  Some  time  later,  the  output  voltage  will  have 
risen to a value that causes the polarity of the non-
inverting  input  of  IC2  to  revert  to  its  original 
(positive)  state  and 
the  cycle  will  continue 
indefinitely. 
  The  upper  threshold  voltage  (i.e.  the  maximum 
positive value for Vout) will be given by:
