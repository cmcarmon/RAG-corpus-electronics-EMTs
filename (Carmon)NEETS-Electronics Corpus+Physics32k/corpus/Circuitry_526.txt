The  instruction  decoder  is  nothing  more  than  an 
arrangement  of  logic  gates  that  acts  on  the  bits 
stored  in  the  instruction  register  and  determines 
which instruction is currently being referenced. The 
instruction decoder provides output signals  for the 
microprocessorâ€™s control unit.
