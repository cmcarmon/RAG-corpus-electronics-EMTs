In an electronic amplifier, an operating point is a combination of current and voltage at "no signal" conditions; application a signal to the stage changes voltage and current in the stage. The operating point in an amplifier is set by the intersection of the load line with the non-linear characteristics of the device. By adjusting the bias on the stage, an operating point can be selected that maximizes the signal output of the stage and minimizes distortion.
