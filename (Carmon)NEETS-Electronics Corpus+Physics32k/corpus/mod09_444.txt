The amplitude of the rise of voltage is known as the PHYSICAL LENGTH. It is called physical 
length because the greater the peak voltage, the greater physical distance the beam will move. For 
example, the amount of voltage needed to move an electron beam 4 inches is twice the amount needed to 
move the beam 2 inches across the face of a given crt.
