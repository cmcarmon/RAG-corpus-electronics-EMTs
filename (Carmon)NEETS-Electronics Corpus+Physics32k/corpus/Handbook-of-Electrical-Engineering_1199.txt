Theorem 3. Let Pk denote the orthogonal projection operators onto the closed subspaces  Ck for k = 1,2,  ...,
m of Hilbert space X. Moreover, let C designate the nonempty closed subspace formed by the intersection of
these closed subspaces so that C = C 1˙ C 2˙  ...  ˙ C m. If PC designates the orthogonal projection matrix onto
closed subspace C and T = P1P2  …Pm, it then follows that  Tn converges strongly to PC , that is,
