Asyncronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LANs
ATM LANs are relatively new to the LAN marketplace. This is a packet switching technology utilizing relatively
short,  Ô¨Åxed  length  packets  to  provide  networking  services. ATM  was  originally  seen  as  a  way  to  develop  the
next generation wide area telephone network using packet switching, rather than the more conventional circuit
switching technology. It was envisioned as a way to transport video, voice, and data in an integrated network.
A short packet size was chosen to meet several requirements including minimizing real-time queueing delay.
While progress on the original goal of using ATM technology in wide area telephone networks proceeded
slowly  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  challenge  and  the  large  investments  involved,  a  number  of  smaller
companies introduced ATM local area network products using much the same technology.
