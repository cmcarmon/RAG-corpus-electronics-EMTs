Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) tells us that the algebraic sum of currents entering and
exiting a node must equal zero, so we can relate these three currents (I1, I2, and I3) to each
other in a single equation. For the sake of convention, I’ll denote any current entering the node
as positive in sign, and any current exiting the node as negative in sign:
