The maximum shear stress created in a solid round bar subject to impact is given as the equation:




τ
=




2
U
G

V



,


{\displaystyle \tau ={\sqrt {2UG \over V}},}

where
U = change in kinetic energy;
G = shear modulus;
V = volume of rod;
and
U = Urotating + Uapplied;
Urotating = 1/2Iω2;
Uapplied = Tθdisplaced;
I = mass moment of inertia;
ω = angular speed.
