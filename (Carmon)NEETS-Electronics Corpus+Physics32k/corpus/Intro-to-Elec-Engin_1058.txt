*12.1.7 A 100-turn coil in the conﬁguration of Figure
P12.1.3 is rotated at a constant speed of 1200
r/min in a magnetic ﬁeld. The rms induced volt-
age across the coil is 1 kV, and each turn has a
length l = 112.5 cm and a width w = 10 cm.
Determine the required value of the ﬂux density.
iron-clad
plunger magnet is shown in Figure P12.1.8. The
small air gap between the sides of the plunger
and the iron shell is uniform and 0.25 mm long.
Neglect leakage and fringing, and consider the
iron to be inﬁnitely permeable. The coil has 1000
