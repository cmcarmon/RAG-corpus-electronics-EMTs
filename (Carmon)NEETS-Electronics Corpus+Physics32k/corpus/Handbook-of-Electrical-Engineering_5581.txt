The  second  element  of  the  protection  system  is  the  relay  (R).  This  is  the  device  that,  using  the  current,
voltage, and other inputs, can determine if a fault exists on the system, for which action on the part of the relay
is needed. We will discuss relays in greater detail in the following. The third element of the protection chain is
the circuit breaker (B), which does the actual job of interrupting the ï¬‚ow of current to the fault. Modern high-
voltage circuit breakers are capable of interrupting currents of up to 100,000 A, against system voltages of up
to 800,000 V, in about 15 to 30 ms. Lower-voltage circuit breakers are generally slower in operating speed. The
last element of the protection chain is the station battery, which powers the relays and circuit breakers. The
battery voltage has also been standardized at 125 V, although some other voltage levels may prevail in generating
stations and in older substations.
