p r o b l e m 6.3 Consider a family of logic gates that operate under the static dis-
cipline with the following voltage thresholds: VOL = 1 V, VIL = 1.3 V, VOH = 4 V,
and VIH = 3 V. Consider the N-input NAND gate design shown in Figure 6.63. In the
design R = 100k and RON for the MOSFETs is given to be 1k. VT for the MOSFETs
is 1.5 V. What is the maximum value of N for which the NAND gate will satisfy the
static discipline? What is the maximum power dissipated by the NAND gate for this
value of N?
