We have presented simpliﬁed steps for the synthesis of LC
ﬁlters. The intention was to provide enough information for
a general understanding and for encouraging the reading of
more advanced books. The material should be sufﬁcient for
practical situations when tables of ﬁlters can be used. We have
intentionally skipped synthesis of RC networks. The theory is
available but is almost never used for designs, and is in many
respects similar to what has been presented. Synthesis of RC
networks can be found in specialized books. All references
except Mitra (1969), which is an early text concerning
active network synthesis, are classic texts about passive net-
work synthesis.
