True harmonics are always exact multiples of the basic or fundamental frequency generated by an
oscillator and are created in amplifiers and their associated circuits. Even harmonics are 2, 4, 6, and so on,
times the fundamental; odd harmonics are 3, 5, 7, and so on, times the fundamental. If an oscillator has a
fundamental frequency of 2,500 kilohertz, the harmonically related frequencies are
