A point where the second derivative of a function changes sign is called an inflection point. At an inflection point, the second derivative may be zero, as in the case of the inflection point x = 0 of the function y = x3, or it may fail to exist, as in the case of the inflection point x = 0 of the function y = x1/3. At an inflection point, a function switches from being a convex function to being a concave function or vice versa.
