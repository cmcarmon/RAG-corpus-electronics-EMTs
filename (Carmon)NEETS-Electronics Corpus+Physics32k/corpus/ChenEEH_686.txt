So on the longer term, the bottleneck should be broken also
by other means. In sections 2.4 to 2.7 it is shown that this
breakdown is feasible with quite spectacular effects at the level
of the system-design methodology. The price paid will be
increased design complexity that can however be offset with
appropriate design methodology support tools.
