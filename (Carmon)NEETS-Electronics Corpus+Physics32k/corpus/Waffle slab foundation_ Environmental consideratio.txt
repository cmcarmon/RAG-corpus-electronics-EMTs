Environmental engineers note reduced carbon emissions and air quality emissions are usually of the same magnitude as the reduction in concrete needed for any foundation project. Since use of an on-grade mat foundation typically results in a 20% - 30% reduction in concrete, a similar or even greater reduction in carbon emissions and air emissions will also occur. Because a waffle slab uses less raw materials (cement, iron, fuel, water, aggregate, and sand) than traditional slab-on-grade foundations, the system is also more environmentally sustainable.
