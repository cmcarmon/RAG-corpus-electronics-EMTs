For a more thorough test of wire insulation, another high-voltage ohmmeter commonly
called a hi-pot tester is used. These specialized instruments produce voltages in excess of 1 kV,
and may be used for testing the insulating effectiveness of oil, ceramic insulators, and even the
integrity of other high-voltage instruments. Because they are capable of producing such high
voltages, they must be operated with the utmost care, and only by trained personnel.
