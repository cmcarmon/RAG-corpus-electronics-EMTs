A computer simulation can also be used to verify the accuracy of these ﬁgures. The following
SPICE analysis will show all resistor voltages and currents (note the current-sensing vi1, vi2, .
. . ”dummy” voltage sources in series with each resistor in the netlist, necessary for the SPICE
computer program to track current through each path). These voltage sources will be set to
have values of zero volts each so they will not affect the circuit in any way.
