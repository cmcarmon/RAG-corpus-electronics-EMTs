Hall samples do not have to be rectangular, and other common shapes are given in Fig. 22.35(c)–(f); in fact,
arbitrarily shaped specimens are discussed in the next section. However, the above analysis does assume that
n  and µ  are  homogeneous  throughout  the  sample.  If  n  and µ  vary  with  depth  (z)  only,  then  the  measured
quantities are
