In meteorology, hodographs are used to plot winds from soundings of the Earth's atmosphere. It is a polar diagram where wind direction is indicated by the angle from the center axis and its strength by the distance from the center. In the figure to the right, at the bottom one finds values of wind at 4 heights above ground. They are plotted by the vectors

{\displaystyle {\vec {V}}_{0}}

{\displaystyle {\vec {V}}_{4}}
. One has to notice that direction are plotted as mentioned in the upper right corner.
With the hodograph and thermodynamic diagrams like the tephigram, meteorologists can calculate:
Wind shear: The lines uniting the extremities of successive vectors represent the variation in direction and value of the wind in a layer of the atmosphere. Wind shear is important information in the development of thunderstorms and future evolution of wind at these levels.
Turbulence: wind shear indicate the possible turbulence that would cause a hazard to aviation.
Temperature advection: change of temperature in a layer of air can be calculated by the direction of the wind at that level and the direction of the wind shear with the next level. In the northern hemisphere, warm air is to the right of a wind shear between levels in the atmosphere. The opposite is true in the southern one (see thermal wind). So in the example hodograph, the wind

from southwest meet the right side of the wind shear which means a warm advection and thus warming of the air at that level.
