In general, a logic function with n input variables 
 
will  have  2n different  possible  states  for  those 
inputs. Thus, with two input variables there will be 
four possible input states, for three input variables 
there  will  be  eight  possible  states,  and  for  four 
input variables there will be 16 possible states. 
  Take  a  look  at  Fig.  A8.20  and  Fig.  A8.21  and 
compare the output states  for AND  with those  for 
NAND as well as OR with those for NOR. In every 
case,  you  should  notice  that  the  output  states  are 
complementary—in  other  words,  all  of  0’s  in  the 
AND column have been inverted to become 1’s in 
the NAND column, and vice versa. The same rule 
also applies to the OR and NOR columns.
