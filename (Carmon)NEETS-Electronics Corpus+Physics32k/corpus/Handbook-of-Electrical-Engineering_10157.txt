where E = qd – q and can be made to go to zero asymptotically by selecting the gains Kv and Kp appropriately.
This method has a deﬁnite advantage over the earlier method because the model need not be evaluated in real
time. However, it does not provide complete decoupling because the inertia matrix is not diagonal. Furthermore,
since the gains are continuously modiﬁed by the inertia matrix, the response is a function of the conﬁguration
and the payload. A way to circumvent this problem is to continuously modify the gains Kv and Kp. This obviously
suggests an adaptive control approach.
