Appendix A: Algorithm LMCS-1
Algorithm LMCS-1, originally introduced in Section 4.5, is
illustrated numerically in this part of the appendix. Consider
the circuit example C1 introduced in Section 4.3; the corres-
ponding circuit graph and spanning tree are shown in Figures
4.7 and 4.8(A), respectively. The matrices B, M, and L1 in the
Cholesky decomposition of M are as follows:
