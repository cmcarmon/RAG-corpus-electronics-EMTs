1. DG Capturing: A DG is captured by means of either
description language or graphical input. It is composed
of nodes representing computation and edges repre-
senting dependencies between connected nodes. Nodes
are organized in such a way that they are located on
integer grids. In addition,
information such as bit
width and variable type can be associated with the
graph.
