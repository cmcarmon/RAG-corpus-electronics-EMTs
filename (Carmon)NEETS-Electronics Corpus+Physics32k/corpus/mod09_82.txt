In summary, in a series-LC circuit with a source voltage that is above the resonant frequency (300 
kHz in this example), impedance is higher than at resonance, current is lower, and the voltage drops 
across the reactances are lower. All of the above follow in sequence from the fact that X L is greater than 
XC at any frequency higher than the resonant frequency.
