Current conveyors are related to transimpedance ampliﬁers [Svoboda, 1991]. Figure 29.27(a) indicates that
a transimpedance ampliﬁer consists of a CCII+ current conveyor and a voltage buffer. Several transimpedance
ampliﬁers, e.g., the AD844, AD846, and AD811, are commercially available. Figure 29.27(b) shows that a CCII–
current conveyor can be constructed from two CCII+ current conveyors.
