Because electric current is composed of individual electrons ﬂowing in unison through a
conductor by moving along and pushing on the electrons ahead, just like marbles through a
tube or water through a pipe, the amount of ﬂow throughout a single circuit will be the same
at any point. If we were to monitor a cross-section of the wire in a single circuit, counting the
electrons ﬂowing by, we would notice the exact same quantity per unit of time as in any other
part of the circuit, regardless of conductor length or conductor diameter.
