example uses the quality factor Q for the circuit in Figure 14.37 to deduce the general
form of the frequency domain response and the time domain response (specifically, the
zero input response) of the circuit. We will focus on vC and consider two cases: R = 50 
and R = 500 .
Using the impedance method, the magnitude of the system function relating Vc to Vi is
given by
