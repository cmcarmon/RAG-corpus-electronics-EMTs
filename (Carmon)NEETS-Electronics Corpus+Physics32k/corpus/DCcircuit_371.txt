• Ground Fault Current Interruptors (GFCIs) work by sensing a difference in current be-
tween the two conductors supplying power to the load. There should be no difference in
current at all. Any difference means that current must be entering or exiting the load by
some means other than the two main conductors, which is not good. A signiﬁcant current
difference will automatically open a disconnecting switch mechanism, cutting power off
completely.
