The dry cell (fig. 2-4) is basically the same as the simple voltaic cell (wet cell) described earlier, as 
far as its internal chemical action is concerned. The action of the water and the ammonium chloride in the 
paste, together with the zinc and carbon electrodes, produces the voltage of the cell. Manganese dioxide is 
added to reduce polarization when current flows and zinc chloride reduces local action when the cell is 
not being used.
