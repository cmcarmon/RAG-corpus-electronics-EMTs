The Lancer Evolution IX introduced in 2005 features an electronically controlled full-time four wheel drive system, which incorporates Super AYC, ACD and Sport ABS. The Super AYC is an improved version of the AYC system first introduced on the Lancer Evolution IV. Compared to the previous system it now uses a planetary gear differential that can transfer almost twice the torque between the rear wheels. Lancer Evolution IX also uses a revised AWC system that is even more pro-active than in previous generations. On the Evo VIII, the AWC system gave priority to the Sport ABS system in order to stabilise the car under heavy braking. The ACD and Super AYC modules were effectively disengaged. The AWC system has been revised so that the driving force is still controlled actively, even when the Sports ABS is operational. Through a series of high-speed bends, for example, the system will continue to control the yaw moment of the car, even if the driver is applying braking force. The car’s agility and stability are both improved, and the car responds more accurately to steering input on the entry to a corner.
According to Mitsubishi, the Lancer Evolution uses its four-wheel drive system to improve the handling, rather than simply to increase traction. Super AYC acts like a limited slip differential to optimise the Lancer’s handling during hard driving. It improves cornering performance by transferring torque between the rear wheels. It also works harmoniously with the ACD, which was introduced on the Evolution VII. Mitsubishi's Sports ABS system is used to enhance the steering control during hard driving. The Sport ABS ECU uses inputs from steering angle, lateral G and vehicle speed sensors to individually apportion braking pressure to each of the four wheels.
