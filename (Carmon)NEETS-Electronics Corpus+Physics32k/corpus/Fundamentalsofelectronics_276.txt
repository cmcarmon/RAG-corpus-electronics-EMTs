• The current iin must be very small. The voltage produced by the dependent source is 105 times the
voltage v. Thus, the voltage v must be small, which means that iin =
must be tiny. For example,
if the output is about 1 V, the voltage v = 10−5V, making the current iin = 10−11A. Consequently,
we can ignore iin in our calculations and assume it to be zero.
• Because of this assumption—essentially no current ﬂow through Rin—the voltage v must also be
essentially zero. This means that in op-amp circuits, the voltage across the op-amp’s input is basically
zero.
