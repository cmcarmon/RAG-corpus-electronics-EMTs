For the inputs indicated on the other lines of Table 9.2.1 the reader can reason out the other
columns shown. In terms of the high and low ranges, the operation of the gate is illustrated in Table
9.2.2. The truth table is given in Table 9.2.3 using the positive logic in which high is indicated by
1 and low is indicated by 0. One can now see that the circuit does function as a NAND gate.
