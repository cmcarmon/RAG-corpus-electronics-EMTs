array[1 .. kâ€“1]. In order to compute apply(f,x) or update(f,x,y), the list at A[hash(x)] is searched or updated.
If the hash function has been properly chosen and if k and the number of function values different from default
are of similar size, then the individual lists can be expected to be very short and independent of the number
of nondefault entries of the function; thus performance for apply and update is O(1).
