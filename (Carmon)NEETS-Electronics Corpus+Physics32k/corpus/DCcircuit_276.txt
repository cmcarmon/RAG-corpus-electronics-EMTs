In answer to the second question, rubber-soled shoes do indeed provide some electrical
insulation to help protect someone from conducting shock current through their feet. However,
most common shoe designs are not intended to be electrically ”safe,” their soles being too thin
and not of the right substance. Also, any moisture, dirt, or conductive salts from body sweat on
the surface of or permeated through the soles of shoes will compromise what little insulating
value the shoe had to begin with. There are shoes speciﬁcally made for dangerous electrical
work, as well as thick rubber mats made to stand on while working on live circuits, but these
special pieces of gear must be in absolutely clean, dry condition in order to be effective. Sufﬁce
it to say, normal footwear is not enough to guarantee protection against electric shock from a
power system.
