-channel MOSFET Q1 will be turned off and
When a high logic level is applied to the inverter’s input, the 
n
-channel MOSFET Q2 will be turned on. This will cause the output to be shorted to ground through the
the 
low resistance path of Q2’s channel. The turned off Q1 has a very high channel resistance and acts nearly like
an open.
