Theoretically a  can vary from 0 to 180 degrees (with u = 0); hence Vd can vary from +Vd0 to –Vd0. Since the
valves conduct current in only one direction, variation of dc voltage from Vd0 to –Vd0 means reversal of power
ﬂow direction and the converter mode of operation changing from rectiﬁer to inverter.
