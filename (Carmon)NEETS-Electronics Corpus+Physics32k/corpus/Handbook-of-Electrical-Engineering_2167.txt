It is possible to combine the advantages of memory by feedback with the ones of the memory by delays in
linear systems called dispersive delay lines. The most studied of these memories is a cascade of low-pass functions
called  the  gamma  memory  [de Vries  and  Principe,  1992].  The  gamma  memory  has  a  free  parameter  m  that
controls and decouples memory depth from resolution of the memory. Memory depth D is deﬁned as the ﬁrst
moment of the impulse response from the input to the last tap K, while memory resolution R is the number of
taps per unit time. For the gamma memory D = K/m, and R = m; i.e., changing m modiﬁes the memory depth
and resolution inversely. This recursive parameter m can be adapted with the output MSE as the other network
parameters;  i.e.,  the  ANN  is  able  to  choose  the  best  memory  depth  to  minimize  the  output  error,  which  is
unlike the tap delay memory.
