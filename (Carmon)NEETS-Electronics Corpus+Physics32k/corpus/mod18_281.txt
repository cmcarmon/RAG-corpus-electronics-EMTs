The OUTPUT COUPLING transfers the rf energy from the magnetron to the output transmission
line (coaxial line or waveguide). A number of considerations impose restrictions upon the output circuit.
The wavelength (frequency) and the power level of the magnetron output energy determine whether the
transmission line to the antenna will be waveguide or coaxial line.
