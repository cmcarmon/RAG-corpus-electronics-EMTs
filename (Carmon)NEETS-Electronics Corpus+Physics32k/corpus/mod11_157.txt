In view (B) of figure 2-22, the magnetic field has reached a value great enough to cause the electron 
to just miss the plate and return to the filament in a circular orbit. This value is the CRITICAL VALUE of 
field strength. In view (C), the value of the field strength has been increased to a point beyond the critical 
value; the electron is made to travel to the cathode in a circular path of smaller diameter.
