Thin-film Heat Transfer Gauge
When the gauge is heated, the resistance changes; this causes a change in voltage, which is used to calculate the amount of heat transferred into an object.
Piezoelectric Pressure Transducer
Under pressure, crystals became electrically charged, proportional to that of the pressure exerted.
Laser Diode Spectrograph
Measures the properties of the refracted light, generated by the laser traveling through the turbulent gas around an object.
Force -Moment Balance
Used to measure three or six components, three forces (lift, drag, and side) and three moments (pitch, roll, and yaw), to completely describe the conditions on the model. Forces on the model are detected by strain gauges located on the balance. Each gauge measures a force by the stretching of an electrical element or foil in the gauge. The stretching changes the resistance of the gauge which changes the measured electric current through the gauge according to Ohm's law. This resistance change, usually measured using a Wheatstone bridge, is related to the strain by the quantity known as the gauge factor.
