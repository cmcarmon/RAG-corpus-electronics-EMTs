Because only parent-child relationships are allowed, the hierarchical model cannot efÔ¨Åciently represent two
main types of relationships: many-to-many relationships and the case where a record type is a child in more
than  one  hierarchical  schema.  These  two  restrictions  can  be  handled  by  allowing  redundant  record  instances.
However, such a duplication requires that all the copies of the same record should be kept consistent at all times.
The example of Fig. 94.8 shows a hierarchical schema. The schema gives the relationship between a DEPART-
MENT, its employees (D_EMPLOYEE), the projects (D_PROJECT) handled by the different departments, and
how employees are assigned to these projects. It is assumed that an employee belongs to only one department,
a project is handled by only one department, and an employee can be assigned to several projects. Notice that
since a project has several employees assigned to it, and an employee can be assigned to more than one project,
the relationship between D_PROJECT and D_EMPLOYEE is many-to-many. To model this relationship mul-
tiple instances of the same record type D-EMPLOYEE may appear under different projects.
