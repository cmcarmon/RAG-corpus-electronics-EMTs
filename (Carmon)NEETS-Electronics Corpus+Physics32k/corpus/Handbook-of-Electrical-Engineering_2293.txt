Large-Signal Piecewise Linear Model
Piecewise  linear  model  of  a  diode  is  a  very  useful  tool  for  quick  circuit  design  containing  diodes.  Here,  the
diode is represented by asymptotes and not by the exponential I-V curve. The simplest piecewise linear model
is shown in Fig. 22.16(a). Here Di is an ideal diode with VD = 0 at ID ‡ 0, in series with VD0, where VD0 is the
diode cut-in or threshold voltage. The current in the diode will start to ﬂow at VD ‡ VD0.
