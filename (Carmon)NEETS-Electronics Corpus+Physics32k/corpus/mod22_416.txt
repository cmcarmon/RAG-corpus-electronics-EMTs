A modem never knows exactly when to expect data; therefore, it must be given some type of signal 
warning that data is about to be transmitted. This gives the modem time to get itself aligned and in 
synchronization with the incoming signal. Special characters, known as message characters, provide this 
warning and are placed in front of and behind the data to mark the beginning and ending of the message. 
Two methods are used: asynchronous and synchronous.
