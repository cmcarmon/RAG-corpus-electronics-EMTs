Let S be a subset of a topological space X. A point x in X is a limit point of S if every neighbourhood of x contains at least one point of S different from x itself. Note that it doesn't make a difference if we restrict the condition to open neighbourhoods only.
This is equivalent, in a T1 space, to requiring that every neighbourhood of x contains infinitely many points of S. It is often convenient to use the "open neighbourhood" form of the definition to show that a point is a limit point and to use the "general neighbourhood" form of the definition to derive facts from a known limit point.
Alternatively, if the space X is Fréchet-Urysohn, we may say that x ∈ X is a limit point of S if and only if there is an ω-sequence of points in S \ {x} whose limit is x; hence, x is called a limit point.
