in applying certain modern mathematical
techniques for
analyzing and solving nonlinear circuit equations. A circuit
element is passive if it absorbs power (i.e., if at any operat-
ing point, the net power delivered to the element is non-
negative). A nonlinear resistor is passive if
for any pair
(v, i) of voltage and current, its constitutive relationship satis-
