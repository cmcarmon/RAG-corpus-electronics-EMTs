part and an imaginary part. For real linear systems, by superposition, the real
part of the response is due to the real part of the input (namely, cos(ωt)) and
the imaginary part of the response is due to the imaginary part of the input
(namely, j sin(ωt)). Accordingly, by taking the real part of the response to e jωt,
we obtain the response to a real sinusoidal input of the form cos(ωt). (Similarly,
by taking the imaginary part of the response to e jωt, we obtain the response to
an input of the form sin(ωt).)
