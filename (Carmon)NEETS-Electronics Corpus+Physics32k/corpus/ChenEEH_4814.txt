As computers have become faster and as communication
networks have become more efﬁcient in the ﬂow of informa-
tion, the practice of providing speed through tight coupling of
control system software modules has become less necessary.
Replacing the need for speed is the need for ease of system
integration and system evolution. A very desirable feature is
plug and play, which refers to ready interchangeability of
modules and system reconﬁguration with minimal software
or protocol changes. For example, as new sensors become
available, it would be nice to pull out the old sensors and put
in the new sensors with drivers that are ‘‘plug and play’’ with
the rest of the system. Also, for the sake of adaptability, it
would be helpful to have run-time reconﬁguration of the
software (such as updating or changing algorithms online in
real-time). Another desirable feature would be interoperabil-
ity among different processor platforms and different lan-
guages. For example, suppose a processor embedded in an
application is running one type of operating system and a
desktop computer attached to the system is running on an-
other operating system. Data transfer between these two
systems is not trivial; for example, the memory byte ordering
is different between Windows-based platforms and Unix plat-
forms, and word-size differences on 32-bit versus 64-bit pro-
cessor architectures cause incompatibilities.
