is a decreasing function of k (and hence of energy) for k > p/2a. The higher energy states with k > p/2a may
become occupied if the electrons are heated by the external ﬁeld. As a result, a negative differential resistance
can be achieved at high electric ﬁelds. The weak-ﬁeld mobility in a superlattice may exceed that of the bulk
material  because  of  the  separation  of  dopants  if  only  barriers  are  doped.  In  such  modulated  structures,  the
increased spatial separation between electrons and holes is also responsible for a strong increase in recombi-
nation lifetimes.
