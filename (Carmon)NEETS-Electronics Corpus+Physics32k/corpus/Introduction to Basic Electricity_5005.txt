Double-sided printed circuit boards should always 
have some identification on the top and bottom layers 
to aid in proper orientation. In the past, optical targets 
or registration marks were used to aid in differentia-
tion between the top and bottom traces. Presently, this 
step is omitted by identifying pin 1 of an IC with a 
square pad.
