PIN Silicon X-ray Spectrometers
Detectors based on PIN silicon structures have found considerable success as X-ray spectrometers in the region
below  10  KeV.  The  devices  consist  of  n  and  p  layers  on  opposite  sides  of  a  high  purity  (10–20  K  ohm-cm)
silicon wafer. Particularly good performance is obtained if the devices are operated in the region of –30°C as
can be provided by a thermoelectric cooler. On the order of 1 W is required to maintain a typical device at
–30°C. Energy resolution (FWHM) of 186 eV at 5.9 KeV can be obtained in 7-mm2 devices (with 20 µs shaping
time). Spectrometers with areas up to about 25 mm2 are also available, but with reduced resolution. The energy
spectrum of 55Fe obtained with a 7-mm2 detector is shown in Fig. 116.20(a), together with a schematic showing
construction details (Fig. 116.20(b)).
