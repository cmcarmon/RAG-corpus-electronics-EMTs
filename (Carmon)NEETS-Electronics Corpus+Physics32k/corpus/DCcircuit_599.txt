The strategy I have found easiest to apply is to start by tracing the current from one ter-
minal of the battery around to the other terminal, following the loop of components closest to
the battery and ignoring all other wires and components for the time being. While tracing the
path of the loop, mark each resistor with the appropriate polarity for voltage drop.
