The location of the diodes is accurately deÔ¨Åned by the lithographic fabrication process and, being solid state,
is  also  a  rugged  detector.  These  devices  are  thus  very  suitable  for  linear  or  two-dimensional  optical  image
measurement. The devices can be quite sensitive and can have variable sensitivity by adjusting the CCD scan
speed since the diode integrates the current until accessed by the CCD switch. The spectral sensitivity is that
of  the  semiconductor  photodiode,  and  the  majority  of  devices  now  available  are  silicon.  Smaller  arrays  are
becoming more available in many types of semiconductors, however.
