In case of constant acceleration, the four physical quantities acceleration, velocity, time and displacement can be related by using the Equations of motion

here,





V

i





{\displaystyle \mathbf {V_{i}} }
is the initial velocity





V

f





{\displaystyle \mathbf {V_{f}} }
is the final velocity




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
is the acceleration




d



{\displaystyle \mathbf {d} }
is the displacement




t



{\displaystyle \mathbf {t} }
is the time
These relationships can be demonstrated graphically. The gradient of a line on a displacement time graph represents the velocity. The gradient of the velocity time graph gives the acceleration while the area under the velocity time graph gives the displacement. The area under an acceleration time graph gives the change in velocity.
