The magnetization of the sample in zero ﬁeld may be macroscopically zero, but locally the material may be
magnetized virtually to the saturation state. As shown in Fig. 36.6, which shows a greatly simpliﬁed domain
structure, the net magnetization at the center of the loop is zero because the magnetization of the four “domains”
cancels in pairs. A domain is a region (not necessarily square or even of a regular shape, although the shape
often  is  regular  in  Ni–Fe  thin  ﬁlms  or  sheets)  over  which  the  magnetization  is  constant  in  magnitude  and
direction. Thus, the sample in Fig. 36.6 consists of four domains, initially separated from each other by “domain
walls.” If a magnetic ﬁeld is applied in the direction of +H, that domain will grow whose direction of magne-
tization is closest to the ﬁeld direction and the domains will shrink if their magnetization is opposed to the
ﬁeld. For small applied ﬁelds, the movement of the walls is reversible, i.e., on reducing the applied ﬁeld to zero,
the  original  domain  conﬁguration  will  be  obtained.  Beyond  a  certain  ﬁeld  the  movement  of  the  walls  is
irreversible, and eventually near the knee of the magnetization curve all the domain walls have been swept away
by the applied ﬁeld. The sample is not yet in the saturated state since the direction of M is not quite the same
as the direction of the applied ﬁeld. However, a small increase in the strength of the applied ﬁeld ﬁnally achieves
the saturated state by rotating the magnetization of the whole sample into the ﬁeld direction.
