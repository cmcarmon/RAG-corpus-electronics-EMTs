Quicksand is a natural case of a shear thinning, non-Newtonian fluid. This is the opposite of a dilatant. As its strain rate increases, its resistance to shear will decrease causing the system to act more like a liquid than a solid. Hence, as one thrashes about in quicksand one sinks faster as the mixture's resistance decreases.
