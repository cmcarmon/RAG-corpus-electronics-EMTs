A suction excavator produces powerful suction through a wide pipe which is up to 30 centimetres (1 ft) or so in diameter. The suction inlet air speed may be up to 100 metres per second (220 mph). Its construction is somewhat like a vacuum truck (gully emptier) but with a wider suction hose and a more powerful suction.
The suction nozzle may have two handles for the operator to hold; those handles may be on a collar which can be rotated to uncover suction-release openings (with grilles over) to release the suction to make the suction nozzle drop anything which it has picked up and is too big to go up the tube.
The end of the tube may be toothed. This helps to cut earth when used for excavating; but when it is used to suck up loose debris and litter, some types of debris items may snag on the teeth. The earth to be sucked out may be loosened first with a compressed-air lance, or a powerful water jet.
Excavating with a suction excavator may called "vacuum excavation", or "hydro excavation" if a water jet is used. Vacuum excavation (also known as suction excavation) is considered a best practice for safely finding and seeing underground utilities, reducing by more than half the chance of damaging buried utilities.
