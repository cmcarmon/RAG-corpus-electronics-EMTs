The Hellinger distance forms a bounded metric on the space of probability distributions over a given probability space.
The maximum distance 1 is achieved when P assigns probability zero to every set to which Q assigns a positive probability, and vice versa.

Hellinger distances are used in the theory of sequential and asymptotic statistics.
