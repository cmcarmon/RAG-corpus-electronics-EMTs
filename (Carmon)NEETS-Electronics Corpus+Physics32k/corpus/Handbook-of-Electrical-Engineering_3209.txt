The plot of converter gain versus the switching frequency ratio ys, obtained using (30.1), is shown for
Cs/Ct  =  1  in  Fig.  30.36,  for  the  lagging  PF  mode  of  operation.  If  the  ratio  Cs/Ct  increases,  then  the
converter takes the characteristics of SRC and the load voltage regulation requires a very wide range in
the frequency change. Lower values of Cs/Ct take the characteristics of a PRC. Therefore, a compromised
value of Cs/Ct = 1 is chosen.
