the characteristic of that two wave numbers (e.g., kx and ky) are
real (corresponding to the transform variables). In this case, the
third wave number kz will be real if k2
y < k2 and will
be imaginary if k2
y > k2; that is, all transverse wave
numbers (kx, ky) that lie in a circle of radius k in the wave
number plane will be propagating, while all wave numbers
outside the circle will be evanescent. In the ﬁrst case, the power
ﬂow is in the direction of the (real) k vector (kx, ky, kz), so power
leaves the aperture from this plane wave. In the second case, the
power ﬂow is in the direction of the transverse wave number
vector (kx, ky, 0), so no power leaves the aperture for this plane
wave component. If the medium is lossy, there is no sharp
distinction between propagating and evanescent plane waves.
In this case, all plane waves carry power in the direction of the
vector (kx, ky, Rekz ).
