For the above example RC circuit (Figure 3.21), let vin = Vinej2πf t. The complex amplitude Vin deter-
mines the size of the source and its phase. The critical consequence of assuming that sources have this form
is that all voltages and currents in the circuit are also complex exponentials, having amplitudes governed
by KVL, KCL, and the v-i relations and the same frequency as the source. To appreciate why this should
be true, let’s investigate how each circuit element behaves when either the voltage or current is a complex
exponential. For the resistor, v = Ri. When v = V ej2πf t; then i =
ej2πf t. Thus, if the resistor’s voltage is
V
R
