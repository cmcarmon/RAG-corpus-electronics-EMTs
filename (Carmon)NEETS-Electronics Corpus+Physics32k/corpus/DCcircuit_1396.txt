Because capacitors store energy in the form of an electric Ô¨Åeld, they tend to act like small
secondary-cell batteries, being able to store and release electrical energy. A fully discharged
capacitor maintains zero volts across its terminals, and a charged capacitor maintains a steady
quantity of voltage across its terminals, just like a battery. When capacitors are placed in a
circuit with other sources of voltage, they will absorb energy from those sources, just as a
secondary-cell battery will become charged as a result of being connected to a generator. A fully
discharged capacitor, having a terminal voltage of zero, will initially act as a short-circuit when
