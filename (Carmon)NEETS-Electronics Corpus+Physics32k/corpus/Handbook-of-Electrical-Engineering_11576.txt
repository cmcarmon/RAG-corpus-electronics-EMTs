Loss of a limb can greatly impair functional activity. The engineering aspects of artiÔ¨Åcial limb design increase
in complexity as the amount of residual limb decreases, especially if one or more joints are lost. As an example,
a person with a mid-calf amputation could use a simple wooden stump to extend the leg, and could ambulate
reasonably well. But such a leg is not cosmetically appealing and completely ignores any substitution for ankle
function.
