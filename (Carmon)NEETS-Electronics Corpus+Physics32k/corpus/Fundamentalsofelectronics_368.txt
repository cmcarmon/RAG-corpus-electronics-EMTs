The Fourier series and the sine-cosine series are diﬀerent versions of the same idea, each
representing a signal’s spectrum. The classic Fourier coeﬃcients, ak and bk, express the real and imaginary
parts respectively of the spectrum while the coeﬃcients ck of the Fourier series express the spectrum as a
magnitude and phase. Equating the classic Fourier series (4.11) to the Fourier series (4.1), an extra factor
of two and a complex conjugate become necessary to relate the Fourier coeﬃcients in each.
