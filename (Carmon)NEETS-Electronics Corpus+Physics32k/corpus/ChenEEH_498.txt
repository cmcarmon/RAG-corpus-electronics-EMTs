The important property of electrons is determined by the
rule that is called the Pauli exclusion principle. According to
this principle, not more than two electrons with different spins
can occupy each energy state. Electrons occupy the lowest
energy levels ﬁrst. In semiconductors and dielectrics, almost
all the states in the lowest energy bands are ﬁlled by electrons,
whereas the energy states in the higher energy bands are, by
and large, empty. The lower energy bands with mostly ﬁlled
energy states are called the valence bands. The higher energy
bands with mostly empty energy states are called conduction
