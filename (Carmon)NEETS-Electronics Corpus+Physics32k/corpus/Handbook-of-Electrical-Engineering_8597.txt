Some machines require that the datum be properly aligned with the stacking order of the memory columns
in Fig. 87.1. Thus, on the SPARC, a longword must have an address ending in 00 (xxx00 in Fig. 87.1), and a
word address must end in 0. The programmer who arranges to violate this rule will be greeted with an address
error.  Since  the  MC68000  has  only  two  columns,  it  complains  only  if  you  ask  for  words  or  longwords  with
odd addresses. Successor models of that chip (68020, 30, and 40), like the VAX, accept any address and have
the CPU read two longwords and do the proper repacking.
