The Central Fire (Dios phylakÃª) was also called "Watch-tower of Zeus" or "Hearth-altar of the universe". Rather than there being two separate fiery heavenly bodies in this system, Philolaus may have believed that the Sun was a mirror, reflecting the heat and light of the Central Fire. The 16th-17th century European thinker Johannes Kepler believed that Philolaus's Central Fire was the sun, but that the Pythagoreans felt the need to hide that teaching from non-believers.
