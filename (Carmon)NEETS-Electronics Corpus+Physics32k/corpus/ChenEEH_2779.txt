propagation of a narrow Gaussian pulse in a grid having the
Courant factor S ¼ 1:0 at all points except at i ¼ 90, where
S ¼ 1:2075. The exciting pulse has a 10Dt temporal width
between its 1/e points and reaches its peak value of 1.0 at
time-step n ¼ 60. Graphs of the wave function u(i) versus
the grid coordinate i are shown at time-steps n ¼ 190 and
n ¼ 200. In contrast to Figure 9.10(A), the rapidly oscillating
and growing noise component due to numerical instability
originates at just a single grid point along the trailing edge of
