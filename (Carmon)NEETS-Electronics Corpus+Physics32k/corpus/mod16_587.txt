If the amount of deflection from the left and down occurred so that each set of plates acted at the
same time, the picture would be like the one in view A of figure 6-9. For example, if the vertical plates
moved the beam downward (starting from point X) at the rate of 3 units per second and the horizontal
plates moved it to the left at the rate of 1 unit per second, both movements would have been completed in
1 second at point Y. The result would be a straight line.
