Since F = ma by Newton's second law of motion and since F is a central force, then only the radial component of the acceleration a can be non-zero; the angular component aφ must be zero

{\displaystyle h=r^{2}{\dot {\varphi }}=rv_{\varphi }=\left|\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {v} \right|=vr_{\perp }={\frac {L}{m}}}

which equals the speed v times r⊥, the component of the radius vector perpendicular to the velocity. h is the magnitude of the specific angular momentum because it equals the magnitude L of the angular momentum divided by the mass m of the particle.
For brevity, the angular speed is sometimes written ω

{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {h}{r^{2}}}}

Since h is constant and r2 is positive, the angle φ changes monotonically in any central-force problem, either continuously increasing (h positive) or continuously decreasing (h negative).
