Inarguably,	reverse	engineering	is	rather	destructive	and	invasive.	Some	are	not	in
favor	of	it	since	they	do	not	welcome	the	idea	of	tearing	their	works	apart.	For
others,	however,	it	is	a	creative	way	of	improving	an	already	completed	project;
especially	if	the	particular	project	is	outstanding,	they	are	granted	the	chance	to
make	it	even	more	outstanding.
Among	the	common	projects	that	can	be	modified	with	the	use	of	reverse
engineering	are	alarm	clock	radios,	coffee	machines,	and	colored	lamps.
Alongside,	the	knowledge	of	internal	systems,	they	can	add	a	unique	functionality
that	is	not	included	during	commercial	distribution.	For	instance,	you	can	add	a
new	beeping	sound	to	an	alarm	clock	radio.
