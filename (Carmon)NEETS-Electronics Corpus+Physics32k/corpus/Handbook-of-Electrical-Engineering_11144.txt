IQ has two basic elements: the non-invasive, disposable patient interface known as IQ-Connect and
the touch screen monitor, which calculates and displays cardiac output values and trends. The hardware
design of the original MIC was retained but IQ has advanced automated software that features the signal
processing technology known as TFD (Time Frequency Distribution). TFD provides three-dimensional
distribution of the hemodynamic signals being measured, enabling visualization of the changes in power,
frequency,  and  time.  This  clinically  proven  capability  allows  IQ  to  measure  all  cardiac  events  without
using  estimation  techniques  required  in  some  earlier  systems.  (Courtesy  of  National  Aeronautics  and
