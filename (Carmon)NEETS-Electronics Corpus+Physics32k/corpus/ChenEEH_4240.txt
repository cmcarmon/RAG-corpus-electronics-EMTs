WLAN deployment can be either centralized or distributed.
In the central approach, the access points are mainly dumb
devices with the intelligence existing in a central switch. The
access points are just radio stations. In the distributed ap-
proach, each access point has intelligence and is conﬁgured
with access-control
information, user authentication, and
policy administration. The centralized approach may save op-
erational cost but may not be as efﬁcient as the distributed
approach.
