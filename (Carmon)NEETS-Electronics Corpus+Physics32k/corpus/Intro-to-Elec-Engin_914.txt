(a) The equivalent circuit of the transformer, referred to the high-voltage (primary) side,
neglecting the exciting current of the transformer, is shown below in Figure E11.4.1(a).
Note that the voltage at the load terminals referred to the high-voltage side is 240× 10 =
2400 V. Further, the load current corresponding to the rated (full) load condition is
50 × 103/2400 = 20.8 A, referred to the high-voltage side. With a lagging power factor
of 0.8,
