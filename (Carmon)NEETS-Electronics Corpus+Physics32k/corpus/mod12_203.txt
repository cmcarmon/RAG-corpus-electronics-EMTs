Figure 1-45 is a basic plate-modulator circuit. Plate modulation permits the transmitter to operate 
with high efficiency. It is the simplest of the modulators available and is also the easiest to adjust for 
proper operation. The modulator is coupled to the plate circuit of the final rf amplifier through the 
modulation transformer. For 100-percent modulation, the modulator must supply enough power to cause 
the plate voltage of the final rf amplifier to vary between 0 and twice the dc operating plate voltage. The 
modulator tube (V2) is a power amplifier biased so that it operates class A. The final rf power amplifier 
(V1) is biased in the nonlinear portion of its operating range (class C). This provides for efficient 
operation of V1 and produces the necessary heterodyning action between the rf carrier and the af 
modulating frequencies.
