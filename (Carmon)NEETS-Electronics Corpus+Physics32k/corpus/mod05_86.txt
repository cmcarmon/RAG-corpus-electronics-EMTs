Self-excited generators are classed according to the type of field connection they use. There are three 
general types of field connections â€” SERIES-WOUND, SHUNT-WOUND (parallel), and 
COMPOUND-WOUND. Compound-wound generators are further classified as cumulative-compound 
and differential-compound. These last two classifications are not discussed in this chapter.
