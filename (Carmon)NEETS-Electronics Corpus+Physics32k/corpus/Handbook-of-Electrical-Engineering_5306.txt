Early MW-scale demonstration plants employed phosphoric acid fuel cells. Molten carbonate fuel cell systems
have shown considerable promise in recent years with demonstrated efﬁciencies in the 50 to 55% range based
on  the  higher  heating  value.  Another  competitor  in  the  long  range  is  the  solid  oxide  fuel  cell  that  can  be
intergrated with a coal gasiﬁer and a steam bottoming cycle.
