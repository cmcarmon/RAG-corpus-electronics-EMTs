Logical Link Control (LLC) provides conventional data link
protocol functions, such as error control and ï¬‚ow control. LLC
is very similar to several famous data link protocols,
like
Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) or High Level Data
Link Control (HDLC) protocols. The only difference is that
LCC includes the service access points (SAP) information in
the frame to allow for multiple applications (programs) on one
station to communicate simultaneously with other applica-
tions on other stations in the network.
