Semiconductor  material  parameters  of  interest  for  device  fabrication  consist  of  those  involved  in  charge
transport through the crystal, as well as thermal and mechanical properties of the semiconductor. The charge
transport properties describe the ease with which free charge can ﬂow through the material. For example, the
velocity-electric ﬁeld characteristics for several commonly used semiconductors are shown in Fig. 39.11. At low
values  of  electric  ﬁeld,  the  charge  transport  is  ohmic  and  the  charge  velocity  is  directly  proportional  to  the
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld. The proportionality constant is called the mobility and has units of cm2/V-s.
Above a critical value for the electric ﬁeld, the charge velocity saturates and either becomes constant (e.g., Si)
or decreases with increasing ﬁeld (e.g., GaAs). Both of these behaviors have implications for device fabrication,
especially for devices intended for high-frequency operation. Generally, a high velocity is desired since current
is directly proportional to velocity. Also, a low value for the saturation electric ﬁeld is desirable since this implies
a high-charge mobility. High mobility implies low resistivity and, therefore, low values for parasitic and access
resistances for semiconductor devices.
