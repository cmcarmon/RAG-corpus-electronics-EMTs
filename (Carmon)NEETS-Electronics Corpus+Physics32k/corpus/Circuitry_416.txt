(b)  the  open-loop  voltage  gain  (i.e.,  the  ratio  of 
VOUT to VIN with no feedback applied) is infinite.      
  As a consequence of (a) and (b):  
(i) the voltage appearing between the inverting and 
non-inverting inputs (VIC) will be zero, and  
(ii)  the  current  flowing  into  the  chip  (IIC) will  be 
zero (recall that IIC = VIC /RIC and RIC is infinite). 
  Applying  Kirchhoff’s  Current  Law  at  node  A 
gives:  
 
IIN = IIC + IF but IIC = 0 thus IIN = IF
(1) 
 
(this shows that the current in the feedback resistor, 
R2, is the same as the input current, IIN ). 
  Applying  Kirchhoff’s  Voltage  Law  to  loop  A 
gives:  
 
VIN = (IIN × R1) + VIC 
but VIC = 0 thus VIN = IIN × R1
(2) 
 
Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in loop B gives:  
 
VOUT = *VIC + (IF × R2)  
 
but VIC = 0 thus VOUT = IF × R2
 
Combining (1) and (3) gives:  
 
VOUT = IIN × R2
The voltage gain of the stage is given by:
