For the beneﬁt of the student, however, we will assume that resistances speciﬁed in example
circuits are stable over a wide range of conditions unless otherwise speciﬁed. I just wanted to
expose you to a little bit of the complexity of the real world, lest I give you the false impression
that the whole of electrical phenomena could be summarized in a few simple equations.
