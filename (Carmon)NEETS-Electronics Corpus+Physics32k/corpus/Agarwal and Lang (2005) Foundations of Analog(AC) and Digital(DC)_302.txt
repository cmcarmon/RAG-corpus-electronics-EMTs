in
Figure 2.26. Here, the element law for the voltage source directly states that v1 = V.
Next, the application of KVL around the one loop reveals that v2 = v1 = V. In other
words, the voltage from the source is applied directly across the resistor. Next, from the
element law for the resistor, it follows that i2 = v2/R = V/R. Finally, the application of
KCL to either node yields i1 = −i2 = −V/R to complete the analysis. Notice that we
had made use of a similar intuitive analysis in solving our battery and lightbulb example
in Chapter 1.
