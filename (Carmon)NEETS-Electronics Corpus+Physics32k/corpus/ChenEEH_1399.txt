Hutchings and Wirthin (1995) suggested that two types of
run-time reconﬁguration exist: global and local. During global
reconﬁguration, all the hardware resources are allocated with
a new conﬁguration in each conﬁguration step. This method
works for nonpartially reconﬁgurable FPGAs, such as the
Xilinx 4000 series. Applications that use the second type of
run-time reconﬁguration, local reconﬁguration, locally or se-
lectively reconﬁgure subsets of the FPGA during application
execution. Since the larger the size of the region to be recon-
ﬁgured means the longer the reconﬁguration time, Hadley and
Hutchings (1995) have proposed techniques to minimize the
size of the reconﬁgurable region to reduce reconﬁguration
time. Others have developed methods and tools that are able
to produce designs both locally reconﬁgurable as well as glob-
ally reconﬁgurable (Shirazi et al., 2000).
