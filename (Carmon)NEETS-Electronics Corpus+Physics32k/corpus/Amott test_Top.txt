The Amott test is one of the most widely used empirical wettability measurements for reservoir cores in petroleum engineering. The method combines two spontaneous imbibition measurements and two forced displacement measurements. This test defines two different indices: the Amott water index (




I

w




{\displaystyle I_{w}}
) and the Amott oil index (




I

o




{\displaystyle I_{o}}
).
