If z > 0, the poles are in the left half of the s-plane, and therefore the system is asymptotically stable. If z = 0,
as  in  the  previous  example,  the  poles  are  on  the  imaginary  axis;  therefore,  the  system  is  stable  but  not
asymptotically stable. If z < 0, the poles are in the right half of the s-plane and the system is unstable.
