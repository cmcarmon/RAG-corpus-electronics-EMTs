Most organic superconductors are strongly anisotropic, in particular there are charge-transfer salts based on the molecule ET (or BEDT-TTF, "bisethylendithiotetrathiofulvalene") or BETS ("bisethylendithiotetraselenafulvalene") that are highly two dimensional. In one plane, the electric conductivity is high compared to a direction perpendicular to the plane. When applying large magnetic fields exactly parallel to the ET layers in this planes clear evidence for the existence of the FFLO state was found in the specific heat of two different ET-based superconductors. This finding was corroborated by NMR data that proved the existence of an inhomogeneous superconducting state, most probable the FFLO state.
