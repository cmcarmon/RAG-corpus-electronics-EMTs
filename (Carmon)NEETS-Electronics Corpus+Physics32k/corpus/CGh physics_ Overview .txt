Before Ole Rømer demonstrated that light has a finite speed, it was assumed that the speed of light (c) is infinite. Because of the tremendously large value of c (namely 299792458 metres per second in a vacuum) compared to the speeds of things in our daily experience, the propagation of light seems to us as instantaneous. Hence, the ratio 1/c was hidden from our view making relativistic mechanics irrelevant. At speeds comparable to the speed of light (c), special relativity takes the finiteness of the speed of light into consideration by the aid of Lorentz transformation. A non-relativistic theory is recovered from a relativistic theory when the limit 1/c is set to zero.
The gravitational constant (G) is irrelevant for a system where gravitational forces are negligible or non-existent. For example, the special theory of relativity is the special case of general relativity in the limit G=0.
Similarly, in the theories where the effects of quantum mechanics are irrelevant, the value of Planck constant(h) can be neglected. For example, setting h→0 in the commutation relation of quantum mechanics, the uncertainty in the simultaneous measurement of two conjugate variables tends to zero approximating quantum mechanics with classical mechanics.
