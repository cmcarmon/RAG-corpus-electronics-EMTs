Irrespective of whether the two components are in series or in parallel, the state space consists of four possible
states.  They  are:  S1 (1  up,  2  up),  S2 (1  down,  2  up),  S3 (1  up,  2  down),  and  S4 (1  down,  2  down).  The  actual
system conÔ¨Åguration will determine which of these four states corresponds to system success and failure. The
associated state-space diagram is shown in Fig. 110.6. Analysis of this system results in the following steady-
state probabilities:
