The vagus nerve is a primary component of the autonomic nervous system. Polyvagal theory outlines the structure and function of the two distinct branches of the vagus, both of which originate in the medulla. More specifically, each branch is associated with a different adaptive behavioral strategy, both of which are inhibitory in nature via the parasympathetic nervous system. The vagal system is in opposition to the sympathetic-adrenal system, which is involved in mobilization behaviors. According to polyvagal theory, these opposing systems are phylogenetically arranged.
