There are many application-dependent constraints that
govern the path search region in the DP grid. We mentioned
the possibility of local path constraints that govern the local
trajectory of a path extension. These local constraints imply
global constraints on the allowable region in the grid through
which the optimal path may traverse. Further, in searching the
DP grid, it is often the case that relatively few partial paths
sustain sufÔ¨Åciently low costs to be considered candidates for
extension to the optimal path. To cut down on what can be an
extraordinary number of paths and computations, a pruning
procedure is frequently employed that terminates consider-
ation of unlikely paths. This procedure is called a beam search
(Deller et al., 2000; Rabiner and Juang, 1993; Lowerre and
Reddy, 1980).
