As formulated by Albert Einstein in 1905, the theory of special relativity was based on two main postulates:
The principle of relativity — The form of a physical law is the same in any inertial frame.
The speed of light is constant — In all inertial frames, the speed of light c is the same whether the light is emitted from a source at rest or in motion. (Note this does not apply in non-inertial frames, indeed between accelerating frames the speed of light cannot be constant. Although it can be applied in non-inertial frames if an observer is confined to making local measurements.)
There have been various alternative formulations of special relativity over the years. Some of these formulations are equivalent to the original formulation whereas others result in modifications.
