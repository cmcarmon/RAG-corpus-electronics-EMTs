Impedance Z is deﬁned as the ratio of phasor voltage to
phasor current at a pair of terminals in a circuit. The unit of
impedance is ohms. Admittance Y is deﬁned as the ratio of
phasor current to phasor voltage at a pair of terminals of a
circuit. The unit of admittance is siemens. Z and Y are com-
plex numbers and reciprocals of each other. Note that phasors
are also complex numbers, but phasors represent time-varying
sinusoids. Impedance and admittance are time invariant and
frequency dependent. Table 1.9 shows the impedances and
admittances for R, L, and C elements. It may be noted that
the phasor impedance for an element is obtained by substitut-
ing s ¼ j! in the s-domain impedance Z(s) of the correspond-
ing element.
