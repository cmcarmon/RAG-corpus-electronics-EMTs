CSMA/CD is the result of the evolution of these earlier
protocols and the additions of two capabilities to CSMA
protocols. The Ô¨Årst capability is the listening during the trans-
mission; the second one is the transmission of the minimum
frame size to ensure that the transmission time is longer than
the propagation delay so that the state of the transmission can
be determined. CSMA/CD detects a collision and avoids the
unusable transmission of damaged frames. The following de-
scribes the procedures of CSMA/CD:
