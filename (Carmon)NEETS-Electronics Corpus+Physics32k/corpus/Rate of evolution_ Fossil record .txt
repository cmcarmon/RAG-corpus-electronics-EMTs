Thus the fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear, and ultimately disappear, in many cases close to a million years later, without any change in external appearance. One explanation of this is punctuated equilibrium; another, compatible with phyletic gradualism, is that periods of a few tens of thousands of years can barely be distinguished in the fossil record, implying that relatively rapid evolution will always appear as a sudden change in a sequence of fossils. Charles Darwin indeed noted in On the Origin of Species that periods of change would be short compared to the overall existence of a species. During each species' existence new species appear at random intervals, each lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance. The exact relatedness of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine, as seen in the evolution of modern humans.
