METHODS OF FREQUENCY SHIFTING.â€”Frequency-shift keyers operate on either of two
general principles. First, the keyer may take the output of the transmitter's master oscillator and modulate
it with the output of another oscillator that is frequency-shift keyed. This action will result in two
frequencies that are used to excite the first amplifier stage of the transmitter. This system is illustrated in
view (A) of figure 2-4. View (B) illustrates the second method of frequency-shift keyer operation. In this
method the transmitter's master oscillator is itself shifted in frequency by the mark and space impulses
from the keyer unit.
