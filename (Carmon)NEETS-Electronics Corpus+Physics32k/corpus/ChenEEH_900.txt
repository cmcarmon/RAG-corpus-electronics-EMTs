Note that e, as deﬁned in equation 4.20 is the total least
squares error of the actual clock skew as compared to the
objective clock skew. This error permits any two different
clock skew schedules to be compared. Moreover, the clock
skew scheduling problem can be considered as a problem of
minimizing e of a clock schedule tcd given the clock period TCP
subject to
and an ‘‘ideal’’ clock schedule
any speciﬁc circuit design criteria. The ﬂexibility permitted by
such a formulation is far greater since the ideal schedule
can be any clock schedule that satisﬁes a
