To help the technician further isolate synchro problems, many manufacturers furnish tables of 
trouble symptoms and probable causes with their equipment. These tables are a valuable aid in isolating 
trouble areas quickly. Tables 1-2 through 1-7 summarize, for a simple TX-TR system, some typical 
trouble symptoms and their probable causes. Keep in mind, if two or more receivers are connected to one 
transmitter, similar symptoms occur. However, if all the receivers act up, the trouble is usually in the 
transmitter or main bus. If the trouble appears in one receiver only, check the unit and its connections.
