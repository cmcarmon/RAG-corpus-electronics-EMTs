In Europe all retreads, by law, must be manufactured according to EC Regulation 108 (car tires) or 109 (commercial vehicle tires). As part of this regulation all tires must be tested according to the same load and speed criteria as those undergone by new tires.
The Land Fill Directive of 1999 banned tires in landfills in 2003, and banned shredded tires in 2006.
