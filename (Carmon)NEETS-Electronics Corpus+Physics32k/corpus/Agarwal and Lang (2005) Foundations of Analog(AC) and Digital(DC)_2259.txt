This is still a transcendental equation, but it can be solved readily on a calculator.
Often we are interested only in an upper bound on the size of the ripple on
the vC wave when the circuit is in the ‘‘steady state,’’ that is, when the waveforms
become repetitive. In this case the first quarter cycle in Figure 16.12 is ignored,
