Unsigned Binary-Coded Decimal, Hexadecimal, 
and Octal Systems
While  the  binary  system  of  numbers  is  most  appropriate  for  use  in  computers,  it  has  several  disadvantages
when used by humans who have become accustomed to the decimal system. For example, binary machine code
is long, difÔ¨Åcult to assimilate, and tedious to convert to decimal. However there exist simpler ways to represent
binary numbers for conversion to decimal representation. Three examples, commonly used, are natural binary-
(BCO).  These  number
coded  decimal  (NBCD),  binary-coded 
systems are useful in applications where a digital device, such as a computer, must interface with humans. The
NBCD code representation is also useful in carrying out computer arithmetic.
