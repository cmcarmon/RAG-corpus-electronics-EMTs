sisaturation region and the normal forward operation. The
slope of the curves determines the dc output conductance. At
sufÔ¨Åciently high VCE, avalanche breakdown in the BC SCR
causes JC to increase rapidly; this effect is more pronounced in
JC (VCE) if IB rather than VBE is held constant. Often the CE
breakdown voltage for an open base, BVCEO, is used to charac-
terize the breakdown performance of a process. At high
JC and VCE, self-heating occurs that leads JC to increase (in Si)
or decrease (in GaAs) already before the onset of breakdown.
