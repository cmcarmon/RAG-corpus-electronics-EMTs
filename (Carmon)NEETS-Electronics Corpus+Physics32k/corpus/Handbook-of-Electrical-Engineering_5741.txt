Figure 62.16 shows a simpliÔ¨Åed illustration of a statcon which is made
up  of  GTOs  (Gate  Turn  Off)  or  similar  devices  such  as  insulated-gate
bipolar  transistors  (IGBTs)  or  MOS-controlled  thyristors  (MCTs).  The
converter is driven by a dc storage device such as a dc capacitor, battery,
or superconducting magnetic storage, and an ac transformer.. The dynamic
voltage restorer, shown schematically in Fig. 62.17, turns a distorted wave-
form, including voltage dips, into the required waveform. The device injects
the right amount of voltage by way of a series-connected transformer into
the distribution feeder between the power supply side and load side.
