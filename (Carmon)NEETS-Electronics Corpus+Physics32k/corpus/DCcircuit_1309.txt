Another example is the relay, an electrically-controlled switch. If a switch contact mecha-
nism is built so that it can be actuated (opened and closed) by the application of a magnetic
ﬁeld, and an electromagnet coil is placed in the near vicinity to produce that requisite ﬁeld, it
will be possible to open and close the switch by the application of a current through the coil. In
effect, this gives us a device that enables elelctricity to control electricity:
