the gas volume by the metastable and excited gas atoms or molecules. In fact, in large gaps the breakdown is
governed by steamer formation in which photon emission from the avalanches plays a dominant role. Break-
down characteristics of gases are represented graphically in terms of the Paschen curves, which are plots of the
breakdown voltage as a function of the product of gas pressure p and the electrode separation d. Each gas is
characterized by a well-deÔ¨Åned minimum breakdown voltage at one particular value of the pd product.
