lower than the output-low threshold of 0.5 V required by the static
discipline.20
For our static discipline, VIH = 4 V. To obey the static discipline the
inverter must interpret any voltage above 4 V as a logical 1. This is
certainly true for our inverter.21
For our static discipline, VIL = 0.9 V. This means that to obey the
static discipline the inverter must interpret any voltage below 0.9 V as
a logical 0. This is also true for our inverter.22
