However, the fuse designer also has to consider what happens after a fuse blows: the melted
ends of the once-continuous wire will be separated by an air gap, with full supply voltage
between the ends. If the fuse isnâ€™t made long enough on a high-voltage circuit, a spark may be
able to jump from one of the melted wire ends to the other, completing the circuit again:
