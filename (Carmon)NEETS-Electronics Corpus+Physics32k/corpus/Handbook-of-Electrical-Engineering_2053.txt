Another interesting approach is outlined in Fig. 19.6(b). As in subband coding (discussed earlier), splitting
the signals x and y into subbands with analysis ﬁlterbanks A, doing the cancellation in bands, and resynthesizing
the  outgoing  (“error”)  signal  e  through  a  synthesis  ﬁlterbank  S  also  reduces  the  eigenvalue  spread  of  each
bandpass signal compared to the eigenvalue spread of the fullband signal. This is true for the eigenvalues that
correspond  to  the “center”  (i.e.,  unattenuated)  portions  of  each  band.  It  turns  out,  however,  that  the  slowly
converging “transition-band” eigenmodes get attenuated signiﬁcantly by the synthesis ﬁlter S. The main advan-
tage of the subband approach is the reduction in computational complexity due to the down-sampling of the
ﬁlterbank signals. The drawback of the subband approach, however, is the introduction of the combined delay
of A and S. Eliminating the analysis ﬁlterbank on y(t) and moving the synthesis ﬁlterbank into the adaptation
branch $Y will remove this delay with the result that the canceller will not be able to model the earliest portions
of  the  echo-path  impulse  response  h(t).  To  alleviate  this  problem,  we  could  add  in  parallel  a  fullband  echo
canceller with a short ﬁlter. Further information and an extensive bibliography can be found in Haensler [1992].
