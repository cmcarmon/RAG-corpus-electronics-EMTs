high. Series motors are used for driving fans, electric drills, and other small appliances. Since the series ac
motor has the same general characteristics as the series dc motor, a series motor has been designed that
can operate both on ac and dc. This ac/dc motor is called a universal motor. It finds wide use in small
electric appliances. Universal motors operate at lower efficiency than either the ac or dc series motor.
They are built in small sizes only. Universal motors do not operate on polyphase ac power.
