At low frequencies, R4 adds to the load resistance (R3) and increases the gain of the amplifier. As
frequency increases, the reactance of C3 decreases. C3 then provides a path around R4 and the gain of the
transistor decreases. At the same time, the reactance of the coupling capacitor (C2) decreases and more
signal is coupled to Q2.
