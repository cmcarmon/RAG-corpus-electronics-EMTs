Low Frequency Fields
In  the  important  class  of  problems  belonging  to  the  low  frequency  limit,  i.e.,  eddy  current  effects  at  power
frequencies, the second derivative terms with respect to time (wave terms) in Eq. (44.1) vanish. This approxi-
mation is valid if the dimensions of the material regions are small compared with the wavelength of the prescribed
ﬁelds. In such circumstances the displacement current term in Maxwell’s equations is small compared to the
free current density and there will be no radiation [Stratton, 1941]. In this case, while a full vector ﬁeld solution
 = 0 and curl H = J
 Eqs. (44.1) can be
is necessary in the conducting regions, in free space regions, where 
s
 is a scalar potential deﬁned by H = –
. The scalar and vector ﬁeld regions are
replaced by 
coupled together by the standard interface conditions of continuity of normal ﬂux (B) and tangential ﬁeld (H).
