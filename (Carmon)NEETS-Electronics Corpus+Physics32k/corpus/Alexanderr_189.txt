The  proof  of  the  theorem  will  be  given  later,  in  Section  4.7.  Our
major concern right now is how to ﬁnd the Thevenin equivalent volt-
age 
.  To  do  so,  suppose  the  two  circuits  in
Fig. 4.23 are equivalent. Two circuits are said to be equivalent if they
have  the  same  voltage-current  relation  at  their  terminals.  Let  us  ﬁnd
out what will make the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 equivalent. If the ter-
are made open-circuited (by removing the load), no current
minals 
ﬂows,  so  that  the  open-circuit  voltage  across  the  terminals 
in
in  Fig.  4.23(b),
Fig. 4.23(a)  must  be  equal  to  the  voltage  source 
since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus 
is the open-circuit volt-
age across the terminals as shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,
