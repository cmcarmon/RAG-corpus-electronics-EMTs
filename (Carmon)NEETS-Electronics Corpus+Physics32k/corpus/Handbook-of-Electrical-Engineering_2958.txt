Electronic switch: An electronic circuit that controls analog signals with digital (binary) signals.
Interface: A collection of electronic modules that provide data transfer between analog and digital systems.
Operational ampliﬁer: A  small  (usually  integrated  circuit)  electronic  module  with  a  bipolar  (+/–)  output
terminal and a pair of differential input terminals. It is provided with power and external components,
e.g., resistors, capacitors, and semiconductors, to make ampliﬁers, ﬁlters, and wave-shaping circuits with
well-controlled performance characteristics, relatively immune to environmental effects.
