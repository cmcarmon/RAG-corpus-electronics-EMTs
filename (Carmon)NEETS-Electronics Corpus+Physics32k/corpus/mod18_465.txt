In measuring the ring time, you should make sure the echo-box ringing (not some fixed-target echo 
or block of echoes) is being monitored. You can determine this condition by adjusting the radar gain 
control and noting if the ring time varies on the scope. The echo box ringing will change in duration; 
fixed target echoes, however, will not change duration.
