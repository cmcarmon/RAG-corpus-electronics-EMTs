If all three switches are closed, the supply current travels through the resis-
tor and then splits three different ways â€” with some current passing through 
each of the three LEDs. If all three switches are open, the current does not 
have a complete path to follow, so no current flows out of the battery, as 
shown in Figure 4-11.
