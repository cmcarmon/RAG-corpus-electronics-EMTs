Solution:
(a)  To  ﬁnd  the  Thevenin  resistance 
at
the terminals a-b in the circuit in Fig. 4.31, we ﬁrst use Schematics to
draw the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.53(a). Notice that a probing current
source I2 is inserted at the terminals. Under Analysis/Setput, we select
DC  Sweep.  In  the  DC  Sweep  dialog  box,  we  select  Linear  for  the
Sweep  Type and  Current  Source  for  the  Sweep  Var.  Type. We  enter  I2
under  the  Name box,  0  as  Start  Value,  1  as  End  Value,  and  0.1  as
Increment. After simulation, we add trace V(I2:–) from the PSpice A/D
window  and  obtain  the  plot  shown  in  Fig.  4.53(b).  From  the  plot,  we
obtain
