Equation (61.53) indicates that the magnitudes of harmonics are inversely proportional to their order.
Converter ac current waveform iaÂ¢ for phase a  with a Y/D transformer is also shown in Fig. 61.14. Fourier
analysis of this current shows that the fundamental and harmonic components will have the same magnitude
