The battery voltage, of course, hasn’t changed since the ﬁrst simulation: its still at 24 volts.
The circuit current, on the other hand, is much less this time because we’ve made the resistor
a larger value, making it more difﬁcult for electrons to ﬂow. SPICE tells us that the current
this time is equal to -4.800E-03 amps, or -4.800 x 10−3 amps. This is equivalent to taking the
number -4.8 and skipping the decimal point three places to the left.
