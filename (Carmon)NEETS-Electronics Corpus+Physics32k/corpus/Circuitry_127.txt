Since  the  inductors  are  identical,  the  applied 
current will be shared equally between them. Hence 
each inductor should have a current rating of 1 A. 
 
Example 2.31 
 
Determine  the  effective  inductance  of  the  circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.41. 
 
Solution 
 
The  circuit  can  be  progressively  simplified  as 
shown in Fig. 2.42. The stages in this simplification 
are as follows:
