Using electronic circuit simulation software allows 
users to become part of the learning process by actively 
engaging them in the creation of electronic circuits, 
studying circuit operation, and evaluating their per-
formance. Being able to simulate an electronic circuit’s 
behavior before constructing it can improve a circuit’s 
design by helping the creator identify poor circuit de-
signs. Knowing a circuit operates poorly provides an op-
portunity to improve performance through redesigning.
Electronic circuit simulation offers the ability to
