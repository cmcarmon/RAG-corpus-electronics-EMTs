(8.20)
Notice from Equation 8.20 that the small signal gain is a constant âˆ’gmRL.
Note, however, that gm, and therefore the gain, depends on the choice of bias
point for the amplifier. Equation 8.19 demonstrates that for small excursions
from a DC operating point, a linear amplifier results! This result forms the basis
of the small-signal model.
