then allowed to cool, forming a conductive joint. Standard solder used 
for electronics is 60/40 rosin core, which contains roughly 60 percent 
tin and 40 percent lead and has a core of rosin flux. (Avoid solder for-
mulated for plumbing, which corrodes electronic parts and circuit 
boards.) The wax‐like flux helps to clean the metals you’re joining, and 
it improves the molten solder’s capability to flow around and adhere 
to the components and wire, ensuring a good solder joint. Solder is 
sold in spools, and I recommend diameters of 0.031 inch (22 gauge) or 
0.062 inch (16 gauge) for hobby electronics projects.
The lead content in 60/40 rosin core solder may pose a health hazard if 
you don’t handle it carefully. Be sure to keep your hands away from your 
mouth and eyes whenever you’ve been touching this solder. Above all, 
don’t use your teeth to hold a piece of solder while your hands are busy.
