Actually, the radar energy is distributed more or less symmetrically over a band of frequencies. This 
frequency distribution of energy is known as the FREQUENCY SPECTRUM. An analysis of frequency 
spectrum characteristics may be made with a SPECTRUM ANALYZER. The spectrum analyzer presents 
a graphic display of energy versus frequency. An extensive explanation of spectrum analyzer use can be 
found in the Electronics Installation and Maintenance Book (EIMB), Test Methods and Practices, 
NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0130.
