740 RPM. The minimum engine speed is 601 RPM, with a
difference of 139 RPM from the nominal idle speed of 740
RPM. The maximum engine speed is 837 RPM, with a difference
of 126 RPM. The 5% rising time is about 40 engine cycles for the
loading case and even longer for the unloading case. Hence, one
can conclude that the proposed sliding-mode controller gives
