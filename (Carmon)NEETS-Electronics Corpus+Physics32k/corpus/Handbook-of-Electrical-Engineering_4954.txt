Pyroelectric single-element IR detectors come in many different varieties. A typical commercial device will
have the sensitive element made from a material of the type discussed in the next section, such as a piece of
lithium tantalate crystal or a ferroelectric ceramic. The element size will be a few millimeters square. Typical
performance ﬁgures at about 10 Hz would be a responsivity of a few hundred volts per watt of input radiation,
 for unity
a noise equivalent power of about 8 
bandwidth. The detector can be ﬁtted with a wide variety of windows, depending upon the wavelength of the
radiation to be detected.
