lead is that it have very low impedance due to the large deﬁbrillation currents, but can still withstand repeated
ﬂexing due to millions of heartbeats. This is achieved using a combination of high-strength, low-impedance
metals. The pace/sense electrodes are similar in design to those used by pacemakers. The leads are ﬁxed in place
by either a screw-in mechanism or ﬂexible tines.
