A requirement of General Relativity is that all measurements must be made locally. We can therefore imagine that the particles are inside a windowless spacecraft co-orbiting the earth with the center of mass of the spacecraft coincident with one of the particles. That particle would be at rest with respect to the spacecraft. An observer in the spacecraft would have no indication that the craft was orbiting the earth. The observer is only allowed to measure the behavior of the particles in the frame of the craft.
In this example, we can define a local coordinate system such that the



z


{\displaystyle z}
-direction is toward the ceiling of the craft and this is directed along




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
. The



x


{\displaystyle x}
-direction is toward the front of the craft and is in the direction of




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
. The



y


{\displaystyle y}
-direction is toward the left side of the craft.
In this frame, the vector




h



{\displaystyle \mathbf {h} }
is the position vector for the second particle. An observer in the craft would think the second particle was oscillating in a potential well generated by a gravitational field. This is an example of a coordinate acceleration due to the choice of frames as opposed to a physical acceleration due to actual forces.
