PERIGEE and APOGEE are two, of the three parameters used to describe orbital data of a satellite. 
These are shown on figure 4-2. Perigee is the point in the orbit nearest to the center of the earth. Apogee 
is the point in the orbit the greatest distance from the center of the earth. Both distances are expressed in 
nautical miles.
