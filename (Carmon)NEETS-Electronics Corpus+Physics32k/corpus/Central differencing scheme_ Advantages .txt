The central-difference schemes are simpler to program and require less computer time per time step, and work well with multigrid acceleration techniques.
The central difference schemes have a free parameter in conjunction with the fourth-difference dissipation.
This dissipation is needed to approach a steady state.
This scheme is more accurate than the first order upwind scheme if Peclet number is less than 2.
