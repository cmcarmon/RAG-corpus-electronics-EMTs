the  d.c.  resistance  of  the  coil  windings  (ideally 
zero), the Q-factor (quality factor) of the coil, and 
the recommended  working  frequency range. Table 
2.6  summarizes  the  properties  of  four  common 
types of inductor. Some typical small inductors are 
shown 
in  Fig.  2.38.  These  have  values  of 
inductance ranging from 15 ÂµH to 1 mH.
