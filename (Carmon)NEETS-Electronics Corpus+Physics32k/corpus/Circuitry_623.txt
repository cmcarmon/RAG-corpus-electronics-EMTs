Because voltage and current appear in an aerial (a 
minute  voltage  and  current  in  the  case  of  a 
receiving  antenna  and  a  much  larger  voltage  and 
current  in  the  case  of  a  transmitting  antenna)  an 
aerial  is  said  to  have  impedance. Here  itâ€™s  worth 
remembering  here  that  impedance  is  a  mixture  of 
resistance,  R, and  reactance,  X, both  measured  in 
ohms  (O).  Of    these  two  quantities,  X varies  with 
frequency  whilst  R remains  constant.  This  is  an 
important  concept  because  it  explains  why  aerials 
are  often  designed  for  operation  over  a  restricted 
range of frequencies.  
 The impedance, Z, of an aerial is the ratio of the 
voltage,  E, across  its  terminals  to  the  current,  I,
flowing in it. Hence:
