An important principle to realize here is that it doesn’t matter where the break occurs. Any
discontinuity in the circuit will prevent electron ﬂow throughout the entire circuit. Unless
there is a continuous, unbroken loop of conductive material for electrons to ﬂow through, a
sustained ﬂow simply cannot be maintained.
