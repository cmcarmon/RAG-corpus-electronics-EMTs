Digital signals are commonly implemented using voltage levels, for exam-
ple, 0 V to represent FALSE, and 5 V to represent TRUE. We observe, however,
that our choice of representing logical values with specific physical values (for
example, representing a logical TRUE with 5 V and a logical FALSE with 0 V)
is rather arbitrary. We can equivalently choose to represent a logical TRUE with
0 V and a logical FALSE with 5 V. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, this
book adopts the convention that TRUE and high correspond to the logical 1,
and conversely, FALSE and low correspond to the logical 0. Table 5.1 depicts
these and several other physical realizations of the binary signals, TRUE and
FALSE.
