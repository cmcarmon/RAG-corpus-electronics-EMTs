Using the center of mass and inertia matrix, the force and torque equations for a single rigid body take the form

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,\quad \mathbf {T} =[I_{R}]\alpha +\omega \times [I_{R}]\omega ,}

and are known as Newton's second law of motion for a rigid body.
The dynamics of an interconnected system of rigid bodies, Bi, j = 1, ..., M, is formulated by isolating each rigid body and introducing the interaction forces. The resultant of the external and interaction forces on each body, yields the force-torque equations

Newton's formulation yields 6M equations that define the dynamics of a system of M rigid bodies.
