In special relativity, the invariant mass or rest mass (hereafter simply "mass") of an isolated system can be defined in terms of the energy and momentum of the system by the relativistic energy–momentum equation:




m
=




E

2


−


(

p
c

)


2




c

2




,


{\displaystyle m={\frac {\sqrt {E^{2}-\left(pc\right)^{2}}}{c^{2}}},}

where E is the total energy of the system, p is the total momentum of the system and c is the speed of light. Concisely, in fundamental units where



c
=
1


{\displaystyle c=1}
, the mass of a system in special relativity is the norm of its energy–momentum four vector; otherwise, it is



m
c


{\displaystyle mc}
.
