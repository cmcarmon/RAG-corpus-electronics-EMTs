This section probes a key implication of numerical dispersion
relations of equations 9.26 and 9.33. Namely, numerical waves
in a two- or three-dimensional Yee space lattice have a propa-
gation velocity that is dependent on the direction of wave
propagation. The space lattice thus represents an anisotropic
medium.
