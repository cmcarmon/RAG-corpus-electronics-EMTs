The working voltage for a capacitor is generally speciÔ¨Åed by the manufacturer, thereby giving
the maximum voltage that can safely be applied between the capacitor terminals. Exceeding this
limit may result in the breakdown of the insulation and then the formation of an electric arc between
the capacitor plates. Unintentional or parasitic capacitances that occur due to the proximity of
circuit elements may have serious effects on the circuit behavior.
