The SI unit for density is:
kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3)
Litres and metric tons are not part of the SI, but are acceptable for use with it, leading to the following units:
kilograms per liter (kg/L)
grams per milliliter (g/mL)
metric tons per cubic meter (t/m3)
Densities using the following metric units all have exactly the same numerical value, one thousandth of the value in (kg/m3). Liquid water has a density of about 1 kg/dm3, making any of these SI units numerically convenient to use as most solids and liquids have densities between 0.1 and 20 kg/dm3.
kilograms per cubic decimetre (kg/dm3)
grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm3)
1 gram/cm3 = 1000 kg/m3

megagrams (metric tons) per cubic metre (Mg/m3)
In US customary units density can be stated in:
Avoirdupois ounces per cubic inch (1 g/cc ≈ 0.578036672 oz/cu in)
Avoirdupois ounces per fluid ounce (1 g/cc ≈ 1.04317556 oz/fl. oz = 1.04317556 lbs/pint)
Avoirdupois pounds per cubic inch (1 g/cc ≈ 0.036127292 lb/cu in)
pounds per cubic foot (1 g/cc ≈ 62.427961 lb/cu ft)
pounds per cubic yard (1 g/cc ≈ 1685.5549 lb/cu yd)
pounds per US liquid gallon (1 g/cc ≈ 8.34540445 lb/gal)
pounds per US bushel (1 g/cc ≈ 77.6888513 lb/bu)
slugs per cubic foot
Imperial units differing from the above (as the Imperial gallon and bushel differ from the US units) in practice are rarely used, though found in older documents. The Imperial gallon was based on the concept that an Imperial fluid ounce of water would have a mass of one Avoirdupois ounce, and indeed 1 g/cc ≈ 1.00224129 ounces per Imperial fluid ounce = 10.0224129 lbs per Imperial gallon. The density of precious metals could conceivably be based on Troy ounces and pounds, a possible cause of confusion.
