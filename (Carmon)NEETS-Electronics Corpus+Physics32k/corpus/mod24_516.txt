Core diameter is measured using EIA/TIA-455-58. The core diameter is defined from the refractive
index profile n(r) or the output near-field radiation pattern. Our discussion is limited to measuring the
core diameter directly from the output near-field radiation pattern obtained using EIA/TIA-455-43.
