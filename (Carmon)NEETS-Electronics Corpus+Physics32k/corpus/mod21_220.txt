To test the Triac with an ohmmeter (R ·  1 scale), you connect the ohmmeter’s negative lead to anode
1 and the positive lead to anode 2, as shown in figure 2-13. The ohmmeter should indicate a very high
resistance. Short the gate to anode 2; then remove it. The resistance reading should drop to a low value
and remain low until either of the ohmmeter leads is disconnected from the Triac. This completes the first
test.
