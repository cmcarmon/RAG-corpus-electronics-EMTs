Third, the saturation discipline is met only for vIN values between 1 V and
approximately 2.3 V. When the input vIN is less than 1 V, the MOSFET is
in cutoff. Similarly, when vIN is greater than approximately 2.3 V, the output
falls more than one threshold drop below the input. For instance, notice that
when vIN is 2.32 V, the output is 1.3 V, which is more than one threshold drop
below the input voltage.
