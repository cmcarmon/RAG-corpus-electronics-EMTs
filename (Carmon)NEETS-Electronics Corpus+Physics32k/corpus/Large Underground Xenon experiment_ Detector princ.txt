The detector is isolated from background particles by a surrounding water tank and the earth above. This shielding reduces cosmic rays and radiation interacting with the xenon.
Interactions in liquid xenon generate 175 nm ultraviolet photons and electrons. The photons are immediately detected by two arrays of 61 photomultiplier tubes at the top and bottom of the detector. These prompt photons are the S1 signal. Electrons generated by the particle interactions drift upwards towards the xenon gas by an electric field. The electrons are pulled in the gas at the surface by a stronger electric field, and produce electroluminescence photons detected as the S2 signal. The S1 and subsequent S2 signal constitute a particle interaction in the liquid xenon.
The detector is a time-projection chamber (TPC), using the time between S1 and S2 signals to find the interaction depth since electrons move at constant velocity in the liquid (around 1â€“2 km/s, depending on the electric field). The x-y coordinate of the event is inferred from electroluminescence photons at the top array by statistical methods (Monte Carlo and maximum likelihood estimation) to a resolution under 1 cm.
