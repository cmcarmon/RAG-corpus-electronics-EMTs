A radial parabolic trajectory is a non-periodic trajectory on a straight line where the relative velocity of the two objects is always the escape velocity. There are two cases: the bodies move away from each other or towards each other.
There is a rather simple expression for the position as function of time:




r
=
(
4.5
μ

t

)

{\displaystyle r=(4.5\mu t^{2})^{1/3}\!\,}

where
μ is the standard gravitational parameter




t
=
0




{\displaystyle t=0\!\,}
corresponds to the extrapolated time of the fictitious starting or ending at the center of the central body.
At any time the average speed from



t
=
0




{\displaystyle t=0\!\,}
is 1.5 times the current speed, i.e. 1.5 times the local escape velocity.
To have



t
=
0




{\displaystyle t=0\!\,}
at the surface, apply a time shift; for the Earth (and any other spherically symmetric body with the same average density) as central body this time shift is 6 minutes and 20 seconds; seven of these periods later the height above the surface is three times the radius, etc.
