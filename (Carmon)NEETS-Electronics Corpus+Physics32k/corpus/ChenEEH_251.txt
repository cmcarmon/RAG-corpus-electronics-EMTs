switches needed to meet
the 80% efﬁciency requirement
when the input voltage is 5 V. In Figure 1.12 (A), when the
output voltage is 2 V, paralleling two switches can enable the
device to meet the efﬁciency requirement at heavy load.
However, when the output voltage is 1.2 V, as shown in Figure
1.12 (B), no matter how many switches are in parallel, the
VRM cannot meet the 80% efﬁciency requirement at heavy
