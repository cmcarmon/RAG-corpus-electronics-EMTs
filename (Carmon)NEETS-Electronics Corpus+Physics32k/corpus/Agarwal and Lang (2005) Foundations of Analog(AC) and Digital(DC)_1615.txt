Let us now compute the total power dissipated in the inverter when a time-
varying input signal is applied. The total power will include both the static
power and the dynamic power. Dynamic power dissipation results from the
transient currents that flow through the resistors to charge and discharge the
capacitor, as depicted in Figures 11.8 and 11.9.
