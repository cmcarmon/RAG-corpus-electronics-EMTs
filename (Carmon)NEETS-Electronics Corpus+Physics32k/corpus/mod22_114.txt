X-RAYS.â€”There is some question about the effect that airport x-ray machines have on disks. It has 
been the normal experience that the walk-through x-ray machines at airports have no effect on floppy 
disks; however, this is not to say there will be no effect. It is up to you because these disks contain the 
data you work with and need. You may not want to take the chance the disks will be affected.
