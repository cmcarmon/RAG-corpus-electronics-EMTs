The Act also contains a number of obligations on vehicle repairers. A person must not commence or carry our repair work on an accident damaged motor vehicle without approval in writing. If work commences without authority the person conducting the work is unable to take legal action to commence any sum or charge relating to the work or any quote prepared in relation to the work.
The Act also gives owners of damaged motor vehicles the benefit of a cooling off period in recognition that they may have made an arrangement for repair of the vehicle following an accident without the opportunity to think clearly about the matter due to trauma or shock. The owner of the vehicle is therefore given three working days after signing an agreement to repair an accident damaged motor vehicle to terminate that agreement and without the owner being liable for costs.
The Act also makes it clear that the owner of an accident damaged motor vehicle is not liable for repairs to the vehicle which are conducted at a place other than that nominated in the authority to tow. Finally, it is an offence for a person in control of the place where an accident damaged motor vehicle was towed to refuse to release a vehicle or to frustrate or obstruct its release. It is, however, a defence if the vehicle owner authorised work on the vehicle and towing or storage charges are outstanding.
Special requirements apply to repairers in relation to accident towing services in a controlled area. A repairier cannot begin a quote for repairs without confirming details with the allocation body. Other paperwork requirements are also set out in the Act in relation to repairs relating to tows in the controlled area.
