A waveform which undergoes a pattern of changes, returns to its original pattern, and repeats the 
same pattern of changes is called a PERIODIC waveform. Periodic waveforms are nonsinusoidal except 
for the sine wave. Periodic waveforms which will be discussed are the sine wave, square wave, 
rectangular wave, sawtooth wave, trapezoidal wave, and trigger pulses.
