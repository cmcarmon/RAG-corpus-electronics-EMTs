A fundamental property of Oseen's equation is that the general solution can be split into longitudinal and transversal waves.
A solution



(


u

L



,

p
′

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {u_{L}} ,p')}
is a longitudinal wave if the velocity is irrotational and hence the viscous term drops out. The equations become

In consequence

Velocity is derived from potential theory and pressure is from linearized Bernoulli's equations.
A solution



(

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {u_{T}} ,0)}
is a transversal wave if the pressure

{\displaystyle p'}
is identically zero and the velocity field is solenoidal. The equations are

Then the complete Oseen solution is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {u_{L}} +\mathbf {u_{T}} }

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =0,\ p=p_{\infty }}

For certain Oseen flows, further splitting of transversal wave into irrotational and rotational component is possible
