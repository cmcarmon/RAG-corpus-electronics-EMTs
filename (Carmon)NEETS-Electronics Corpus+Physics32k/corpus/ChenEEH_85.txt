2.2.1 Graphs
A graph G ¼ (V , E) consists of
two sets: a ﬁnite set
V ¼ (v1, v2, . . .v n) of elements called vertices and a ﬁnite
set E ¼ (e1, e2, . . .e n) of elements called edges. If the edges
of G are identiﬁed with ordered pairs of vertices, then G is
called a directed or an oriented graph; otherwise, it is called
an undirected or an unoriented graph.
