The easiest way to decrease skin resistance is to get it wet. Therefore, touching electrical
devices with wet hands, wet feet, or especially in a sweaty condition (salt water is a much better
conductor of electricity than fresh water) is dangerous. In the household, the bathroom is one
of the more likely places where wet people may contact electrical appliances, and so shock
hazard is a deﬁnite threat there. Good bathroom design will locate power receptacles away
from bathtubs, showers, and sinks to discourage the use of appliances nearby. Telephones that
plug into a wall socket are also sources of hazardous voltage (the open circuit voltage is 48 volts
DC, and the ringing signal is 150 volts AC – remember that any voltage over 30 is considered
potentially dangerous!). Appliances such as telephones and radios should never, ever be used
while sitting in a bathtub. Even battery-powered devices should be avoided. Some battery-
operated devices employ voltage-increasing circuitry capable of generating lethal potentials.
