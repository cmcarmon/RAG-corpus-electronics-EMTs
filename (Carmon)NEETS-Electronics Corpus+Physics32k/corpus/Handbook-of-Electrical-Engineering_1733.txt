Table 17.1 provides an example illustrating the concept of source coding. The source alphabet contains eight
symbols with the probabilities indicated. For convenience, these symbols have been labeled in order of decreasing
probability. In the context of image encoding, the source alphabet would simply consist of the prototype feature
vectors generated by the vector quantizer. The entropy of this source is 2.31 bits/source symbol. If we were to
use  a  Ô¨Åxed-length  code  for  this  source,  we  would  need  to  use  three  binary  digits  for  each  source  symbol  as
shown in Table 17.1. On the other hand, the code words for the Huffman code contain from 1 to 4 code letters
(binary digits). In this case, the average code word length
