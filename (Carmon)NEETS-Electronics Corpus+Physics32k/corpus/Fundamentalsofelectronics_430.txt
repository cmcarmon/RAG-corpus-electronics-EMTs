4.9 Linear Time Invariant Systems15
When we apply a periodic input to a linear, time-invariant system, the output is periodic and has Fourier
series coeﬃcients equal to the product of the system’s frequency response and the input’s Fourier coeﬃcients
(Filtering Periodic Signals (4.27)). The way we derived the spectrum of non-periodic signal from periodic
ones makes it clear that the same kind of result works when the input is not periodic: If x (t) serves as
the input to a linear, time-invariant system having frequency response H (f ), the spectrum of
the output is X (f ) H (f ).
