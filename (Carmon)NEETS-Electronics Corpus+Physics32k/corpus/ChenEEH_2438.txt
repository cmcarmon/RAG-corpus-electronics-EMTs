Transmitting Mode of Operation
The rigorous electric and magnetic ﬁelds of this dipole antenna
can be derived using Maxwell’s equations (Cheng, 1993; Ramo
et al., 1993). The ﬁnal expressions in the far-ﬁeld region are
provided here and are used to derive the various basic para-
meters. The radiated far-ﬁelds of the dipole antenna can be
expressed in the following form:
