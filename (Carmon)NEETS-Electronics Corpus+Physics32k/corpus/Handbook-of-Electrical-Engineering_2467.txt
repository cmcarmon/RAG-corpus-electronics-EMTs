The dynamic drain-to-source conductance is deﬁned as gds = dID S /dVDS and can be obtained from the modiﬁed
transfer equation IDS = IDSS [1 – (VG S /VP)]2 [1 + VD S /VA] as simply gds = ID S /VA. The reciprocal of gds is dynamic
drain-to-source resistance rds , so rds = 1/gds = VA /IDS. If, for example, VA = 100 V, we have that rds = 100 V/IDS.
At IDS = 1 mA, rds = 100 V/1 mA = 100 kW, and at IDS = 10 mA, rds = 10 kW.
Equivalent Circuit Model of CS Ampliﬁer Stage
A small-signal equivalent circuit model of a CS FET ampliﬁer stage is shown in Fig. 24.15. The ac small-signal

will usually be the case that Rnet @ [RD
rds must be taken into account. This is especially true for the case in which an active load is used, as shown in
Fig. 24.16. For this case Rnet = [rds1
