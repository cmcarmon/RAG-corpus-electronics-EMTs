In the special case of a sphere with a spherically symmetric mass density then ρ = ρ(s), i.e. density depends only on the radial distance




s

.


{\displaystyle s={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}}\,.}

These integrals can be evaluated analytically. This is the shell theorem saying that in this case:

with corresponding potential

where M = ∫Vρ(s)dxdydz is the total mass of the sphere.
