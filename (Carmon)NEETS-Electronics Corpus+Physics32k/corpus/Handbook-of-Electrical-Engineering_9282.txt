For the purpose of this handbook, viruses have also introduced new and “standard” testing phases aimed at
eliminating  all  possibilities  of  viral  contamination  from  the  ﬁnal  delivered  versions  of  software. As  of  1996,
every major software vendor in the world now includes viral protection screening as a standard activity, and
many include multiple kinds of viral protection tools and approaches. This is a serious problem and it is not
showing any sign of becoming less serious.
