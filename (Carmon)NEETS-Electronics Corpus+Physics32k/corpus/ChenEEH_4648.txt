The bounded amplitude performance results are intuitively
satisfying because they are similar in ﬂavor to the H1 results
of Becker and Packard (1994); parameter-dependent controller
synthesis requires the feasibility of a ‘‘controller’’ Riccati in-
equality (equation 9.18), an ‘‘observer’’ Riccati
inequality
(equation 9.20), and a ‘‘spectral radius’’ coupling inequality
(equation 9.19). Thus, the approach to bounded amplitude
control described here requires the same type of numerical
solutions as, for example, induced-L2 control, though the
bounded amplitude problem may be more computationally
intensive due to the line search over a.
As in the induced-L2 problem, the synthesis conditions are
represented by a set of constraints that must be satisﬁed for
each u 2 Q and therefore represent an inﬁnite number of
constraints. The techniques discussed for the induced-L2
problem are applicable here as well.
