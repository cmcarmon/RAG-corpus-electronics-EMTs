3. The plasma display has a very large non-linearity due to the electrical characteristic of the gas discharge
used in all plasma displays. This is an electrical non-linearity, meaning that below a certain threshold
voltage, the gas discharge will emit no light. Of course, above that threshold voltage the gas discharge
ﬁres and emits a desired color. Very sharp non-linearity allows plasma displays to be multiplexed without
limit which makes very large plasma displays practical. This is demonstrated by a number of recently
developed  1280  ·  1024  ·  3  sub-pixel  color  plasma  displays.  This  is  a  considerable  advantage  when
compared  to  other  display  technologies  such  as  the  liquid  crystal.  The  liquid  crystal  display  does  not
have  a  very  good  non-linearity  and,  therefore,  some  other  non-linear  element,  such  as  a  thin  ﬁlm
transistor,  is  sometimes  added  in  series  with  each  liquid  crystal  element  to  increase  the  display  non-
linearity. Of course, this greatly complicates and adds cost to this active matrix liquid crystal.
