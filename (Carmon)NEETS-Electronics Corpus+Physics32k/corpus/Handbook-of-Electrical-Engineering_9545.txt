A  distributed  database  is  inherently  well  suited  for  parallel  processing  at  both  interquery  and  intraquery
levels. Parallel processing at the interquery level is the ability to have multiple queries executed concurrently.
Parallelism at the intraquery level results from the possibility of a single query being simultaneously handled
by many sites, each site acting on a different portion of the database.
