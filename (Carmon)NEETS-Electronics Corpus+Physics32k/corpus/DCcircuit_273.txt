With a tree branch contacting the top wire, that wire becomes the grounded conductor in
the circuit, electrically common with earth ground. Therefore, there is no voltage between that
wire and ground, but full (high) voltage between the bottom wire and ground. As mentioned
previously, tree branches are only one potential source of ground faults in a power system.
Consider an ungrounded power system with no trees in contact, but this time with two people
touching single wires:
