which is called a clock skew schedule or simply a clock sched-
ule (Friedman, 1995; Fishburn, 1990; Kourtev and Friedman,
1997b). If tcd is chosen such that equations 4.5 and 4.6 are
satisﬁed for every local data path Ri?Rj, tcd is called a feasible
clock schedule. A clock schedule that satisﬁes equation 4.7
(respectively, equations 4.14 and 4.15) is called a trivial clock
schedule. Again, a trivial tcd implies global zero clock skew
