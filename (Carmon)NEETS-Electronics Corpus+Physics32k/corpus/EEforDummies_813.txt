it’s suitable for your next project. If it is, make 
sure you know how the connector is wired so 
you maintain the proper polarity (positive and 
negative voltage connections) when hooking it 
up to your circuit. A word of caution: Many wall 
warts output noisy DC power, rather than the 
steady DC power you may be expecting, and 
some newer wall warts are switch‐mode (not 
analog) supplies that may also be noisy or con­
tain voltage spikes.
