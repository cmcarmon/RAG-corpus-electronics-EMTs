Compromising emanations (ce) are, generally referred to as TEMPEST. These signals may be 
unintentional, data-related, or intelligence-bearing. If intercepted or analyzed, these signals could disclose 
classified information. TEMPEST problems are associated with material transmitted, received, handled, 
or otherwise processed by electrical information processing equipment or systems. Any electrical 
information processing device may cause problems. Even your electric typewriter or a large, complex 
data processor may emit interceptable compromising emanations. Some countermeasures taken to ensure 
against TEMPEST problems are listed below:
