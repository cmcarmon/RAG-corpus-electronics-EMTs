The reduction in a circuitâ€™s inductive reactance increases the short-circuit current levels over those for the
noncompensated  circuit.  Care  must  be  taken  to  avoid  exposing  series  capacitors  to  such  large  short-circuit
currents,  since  this  causes  excessive  voltage  rise  as  well  as  heating  that  can  damage  the  capacitors.  Specially
calibrated spark gaps and short-circuiting switches are deployed within a predetermined time interval to avoid
damage to the capacitors.
