The power ON-OFF spring-return toggle switch (S105) turns the tester on by energizing a line relay.
The pilot light (DS107) lights when this relay closes. Above the power ON-OFF switch are five fuses.
Fuses F101, F201, and F202 protect circuits in the tester not protected by other means and have neon
lamps to indicate when they have blown. Fuses F102 and F103 protect both sides of the power line.
