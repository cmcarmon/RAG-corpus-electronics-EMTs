The schematic shown in figure 4-47 is an illustration of a half-wave voltage tripler. When you 
compare figures 4-46 and 4-47, you should see that the circuitry is identical except for the additional 
parts, components, and circuitry shown by the dotted lines. (CR3, C3, and R2 make up the additional 
circuitry.) By themselves, CR3, C3, and R2 make up a half-wave rectifier. Of course, if you remove the 
added circuitry, you will once again have a half-wave voltage doubler.
