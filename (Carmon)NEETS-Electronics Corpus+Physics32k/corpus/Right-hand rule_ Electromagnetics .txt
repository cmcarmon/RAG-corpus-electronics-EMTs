When electricity flows in a long straight wire it creates a circular or cylindrical magnetic field around the wire according to the right-hand rule. The conventional current, which is the opposite of the actual flow of electrons, is a flow of positive charges along the positive Z-axis. The conventional direction of a magnetic line is given by a compass needle.
Electromagnet: The magnetic field around a wire is quite weak. If you coil the wire into a right-handed (or left-handed) helix all the field lines inside the helix point in the same direction and each successive coil reinforces the others. The advance of the helix, the non-circular part of the current and the field lines all point in the positive Z direction. Since there is no magnetic monopole the field lines exit the +Z end, loop around outside the helix, and reenter at the -Z end. The +Z end where the lines exit is defined as the north pole. If you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the circular component of the current your right thumb points to the north pole.
Lorentz force: If a positive electric charge moves across a magnetic field it experiences a force according to the right-hand rule. If the curl of your right fingers represents a rotation from the direction the charge is moving to the direction of the magnetic field then the force is in the direction of your right thumb. Because the charge is moving, the force causes the particle path to bend. The bending force is computed by the vector cross product. This means that the bending force increases with the velocity of the particle and the strength of the magnetic field. The force is maximum when the particle direction and magnetic fields are at right angles, is less at any other angle and is zero when the particle moves parallel to the field.
