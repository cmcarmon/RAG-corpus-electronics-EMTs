n 1907, the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company  (AT&T)  and  the  Western  Electric
Company  combined  their  engineering  depart-
ments and established the Bell Telephone Laboratory
on West Street in New York City. By 1921, the labo-
ratories  constituted  the  largest  industrial  research
organization  in  the  country,  occupying  400,000
square feet in a 13-story building in lower Manhattan
and  employing  more  than  1500  men  and  women.
The organization was put on a more formal footing
in 1925, when Frank B. Jewett was made President of
Bell  Telephone  Laboratories,  Inc.  In  the  following
decades, the labs distinguished themselves by contri-
butions not only to communications technology, but
to  basic  science  as  well.  The  awarding  of  the  Nobel
Prize  in  Physics  to  Clinton  J.  Davisson  in  1937  was
simply the most prominent recognition of the labo-
ratories’ scientiﬁc work.
