You now know that a free gyro maintains a fixed position in space. Because of this property, a free 
gyro can be used to establish a stable, unchanging reference, in any plane (horizontal, vertical, or any 
specific position in between). The gyro-erecting system has the function of positioning the gyro to the 
desired position and helping to keep it there.
