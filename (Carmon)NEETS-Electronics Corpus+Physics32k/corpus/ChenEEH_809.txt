The mixed-mode property of the entity DAC is easily visible
from the interface description. There is both a signal and
a terminal deﬁnition at ports. Obviously, the model is aimed
to the behavioral abstraction level. The branch quantities
related to the terminal A linked to the nature Electrical are
deﬁned in the architectural body. There are two architecture
statements in the executable part of the architectural body: a
compound simultaneous statement (if . . . use . . . else . . . end
use) and the break statement that is sensitive to an event on
the signal S. The output voltage [V] of the D/A converter is
recalculated each time the signal value of S changes. Note that
no additional equations or deﬁnitions are required to enforce
conservation laws at port A.
