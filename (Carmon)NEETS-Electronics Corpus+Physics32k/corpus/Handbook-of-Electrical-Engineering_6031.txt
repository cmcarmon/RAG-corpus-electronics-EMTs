The main philosophy in the design of LFC is that each system should follow its own load very closely during
normal operation, while during emergencies each system should contribute according to its relative size in the
interconnection without regard to the locality of the emergency. Thus, the most important factor in obtaining
good control of a system is its inherent capability of following its own load. This is guaranteed if the system
has  adequate  regulation  margin  as  well  as  adequate  response  capability.  Systems  that  have  mainly  thermal
generation often have difÔ¨Åculty in keeping up with the load because of the slow response of the units.
