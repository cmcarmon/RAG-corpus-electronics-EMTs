Now  consider  what  will  happen  when  the  loop 
gain,  0Av, approaches  unity  (i.e.,  when  the  loop 
gain is just less than 1). The denominator (1 2 0Av)
will become close to zero. This will have the effect 
of increasing the overall gain, i.e. the overall gain 
with positive feedback applied will be greater than 
the gain without feedback.
