In some circuits, there are virtual grounds, which are nodes at the same voltage as 
ground,  but  are  not  connected  to  a  power  supply.  When  current  flows  into  the  virtual 
ground, the voltage at the virtual ground may change relative to the real ground, and the 
consequences of this situation must be analyzed carefully.
