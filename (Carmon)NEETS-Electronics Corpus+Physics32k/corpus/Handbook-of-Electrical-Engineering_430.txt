R) to the reference node R, and that the 2-trees corresponding to Dij can be found by taking all those 2-trees
each of which is a tree of both Gi and Gj [Chan, 1969]. Thus, for D11, we ﬁrst ﬁnd G and G1 (Fig. 3.44), and
then ﬁnd the set S1 of all trees of G1 (Fig. 3.45); then for D13, we ﬁnd G3 (Fig. 3.46) and the set S3 of all trees
of G3 (Fig. 3.47) and then from S1 and S3 we ﬁnd all the terms common to both sets (which correspond to the
