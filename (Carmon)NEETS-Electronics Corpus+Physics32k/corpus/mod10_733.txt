Because the voltage induced in the reflector is 180 degrees out of phase with the signal produced at 
the driven element, a reduction in signal strength exists behind the reflector. Since the magnitude of an 
induced voltage never quite equals that of the inducing voltage, even in very closely coupled circuits, the 
energy behind the reflector (minor lobe) is not reduced to 0.
