The technique used for applying or modulating the high-frequency carrier by the transducer output involves
any one of three different methods. It is possible to modulate a carrier by a change in amplitude, a change in
frequency, or a change in the carrier phase. The last technique is similar to the modulation used in transmitting
color by television. In color TV the brightness signal is transmitted as amplitude modulation (AM), the sound
as frequency modulation (FM), and the color as phase modulation (PM), or pulse coding. Pulse coding is used
to modulate the radio frequency carrier in either AM, FM, or PM.
