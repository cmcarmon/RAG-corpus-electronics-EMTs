Light and transparent materials

When light strikes the surface of a transparent material the following interactions occur –

• Light is reflected from the front surface of the material
• Some light is refracted within the material (depending on thickness) and reflected from the second surface
• Light passes through the material at an angle which is determined by the refractive index of the material and the angle of illumination.

The light that passes through the transparent material can be affected by irregularities within it; these can include poorly dispersed particles, contaminants (i.e. dust particles) and/or air spaces. This causes the light to scatter in different directions from the normal the degree of which being related to the size and number of irregularities present. Small irregularities cause the light to scatter, or diffuse, in all directions whilst large ones cause the light to be scattered forward in a narrow cone shape. These two types of scattering behaviour are known as Wide Angle Scattering, which causes haze due to the loss of transmissive contrast, and Narrow Angle Scattering a measure of clarity or the “see through quality” of the material based on a reduction of sharpness.

These factors are therefore important for defining the transmitting properties of a transparent material-
Transmission – The amount of light that passes through the material without being scattered
Haze – The amount of light that is subject to Wide Angle Scattering (At an angle greater than 2.5° from normal (ASTM D1003))
Clarity – The amount of light that is subject to Narrow Area Scattering (At an angle less than 2.5° from normal)
