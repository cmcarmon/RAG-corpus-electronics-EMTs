When a circuit meets these three constraints, the circuit can itself be
abstracted as a lumped element with external terminals for which voltages and
currents can be defined. Circuits that adhere to the lumped matter discipline
yield additional simplifications in circuit analysis. Specifically, we will show in
Chapter 2 that the voltages and currents across the collection of lumped cir-
cuits obey simple algebraic relationships stated as two laws: Kirchhoff’s voltage
law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL).
