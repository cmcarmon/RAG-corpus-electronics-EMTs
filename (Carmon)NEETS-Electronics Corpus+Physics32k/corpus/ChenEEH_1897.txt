We focus here on faults resulting from physical problems,
discounting speciÔ¨Åcation, design, implementation, and oper-
ator mistakes in the system. The causes of physical faults in
computer and digital systems are many and varied. They range
from fabrication defects (e.g., shorting of the drain and source
of an nMOS or pMOS transistor), to operational faults caused
by extreme operation conditions (e.g., electromigration in
adjacent interconnects from high current density resulting in
shorting of the interconnects, overheating in a portion of a
chip resulting in damage or unpredictable behavior of transis-
tors), and to external disturbance (e.g., alpha-particle or
electromagnetic radiation that can change voltage values on
interconnects and capacitances such as those present in dy-
namic RAM cells and in environmental extremes of tempera-
ture, pressure, and moisture).
