Although Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction (Lorentz contraction) by itself is fully able to explain the null results of the Michelson–Morley experiment, it is unable by itself to explain the null results of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment. Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction is given by the formula:

L


{\displaystyle L}

and the Lorentz factor is defined as

Fig. 2 illustrates a Kennedy–Thorndike apparatus with perpendicular arms and assumes the validity of Lorentz contraction. If the apparatus is motionless with respect to the hypothetical aether, the difference in time that it takes light to traverse the longitudinal and transverse arms is given by:

The time it takes light to traverse back-and-forth along the Lorentz–contracted length of the longitudinal arm is given by:

where T1 is the travel time in direction of motion, T2 in the opposite direction, v is the velocity component with respect to the luminiferous aether, c is the speed of light, and LL the length of the longitudinal interferometer arm. The time it takes light to go across and back the transverse arm is given by:

The difference in time that it takes light to traverse the longitudinal and transverse arms is given by:

Because ΔL=c(TL-TT), the following travel length differences are given (ΔLA being the initial travel length difference and vA the initial velocity of the apparatus, and ΔLB and vB after rotation or velocity change due to Earth's own rotation or its rotation around the Sun):

{\displaystyle \Delta L_{A}={\frac {2\left(L_{L}-L_{T}\right)}{\sqrt {1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}}},\qquad \Delta L_{B}={\frac {2\left(L_{L}-L_{T}\right)}{\sqrt {1-v_{B}^{2}/c^{2}}}}}
.
In order to obtain a negative result, we should have ΔLA−ΔLB=0. However, it can be seen that both formulas only cancel each other as long as the velocities are the same (vA=vB). But if the velocities are different, then ΔLA and ΔLB are no longer equal. (The Michelson–Morley experiment isn't affected by velocity changes since the difference between LL and LT is zero. Therefore, the MM experiment only tests whether the speed of light depends on the orientation of the apparatus.) But in the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, the lengths LL and LT are different from the outset, so it is also capable of measuring the dependence of the speed of light on the velocity of the apparatus.
According to the previous formula, the travel length difference ΔLA−ΔLB and consequently the expected fringe shift ΔN are given by (λ being the wavelength):

{\displaystyle \Delta N={\frac {\Delta L_{A}-\Delta L_{B}}{\lambda }}={\frac {2\left(L_{L}-L_{T}\right)}{\lambda }}\left({\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v_{A}^{2}/c^{2}}}}-{\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-v_{B}^{2}/c^{2}}}}\right)}
.

{\displaystyle \approx {\frac {L_{L}-L_{T}}{\lambda }}\left({\frac {v_{A}^{2}-v_{B}^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)}

For constant ΔN, i.e. for the fringe shift to be independent of velocity or orientation of the apparatus, it is necessary that the frequency and thus the wavelength λ be modified by the Lorentz factor. This is actually the case when the effect of time dilation on the frequency is considered. Therefore, both length contraction and time dilation are required to explain the negative result of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment.
