The power plant loses a small fraction of the water through leakage. The feedwater system replaces this lost
water.  Replacement  water  has  to  be  free  from  absorbed  gases,  chemicals,  etc.,  because  the  impurities  cause
severe corrosion in the turbines and boiler. The water treatment system puriﬁes replacement water by pretreat-
ment,  which  includes  ﬁltering,  chlorination,  demineralization,  condensation,  polishing.  These  complicated
chemical processes result in a corrosion-free high-quality feedwater.
