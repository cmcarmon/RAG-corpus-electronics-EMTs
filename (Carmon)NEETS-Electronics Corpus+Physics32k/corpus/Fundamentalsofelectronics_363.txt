The function neg (·) equals −1 if its argument is negative and zero otherwise. The somewhat complicated
expression for the phase results because the sine term in (4.9) can be negative. Because magnitudes must
be positive, the occasional negative values of the sine function must be accounted for by a phase shift of π.
