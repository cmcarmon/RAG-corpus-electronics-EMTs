A superhet receiver 
 
Superhet 
improved 
sensitivity (the ability to receiver weak signals) and 
improved  selectivity  (the  ability  to  discriminate 
signals on adjacent channels) when compared with 
TRF receivers. Superhet receivers are based on the 
supersonic-heterodyne principle where the wanted 
input  signal  is  converted  to  a  fixed  intermediate 
frequency  (IF)  at  which  the  majority  of  the  gain 
and  selectivity 
intermediate 
frequency chosen is generally 455 kHz or 470 kHz 
for  AM 
for 
communications and FM receivers. The simplified 
block  schematic  of  a  simple  superhet  receiver  is 
shown in Fig. 13.11.  
 The  signal  from  the  aerial  is  applied  to  an  RF 
amplifier  stage.  As  with  the  TRF  receiver,  this 
stage  provides  a  moderate  amount  of  gain  at  the 
stage  also  provides 
signal
