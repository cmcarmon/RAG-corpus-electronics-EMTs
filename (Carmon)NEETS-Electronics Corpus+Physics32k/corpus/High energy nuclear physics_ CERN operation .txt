The LHC collider at CERN operates one month a year in the nuclear collision mode, with Pb-nuclei colliding at 2.76 TeV per nucleon pair, about 1500 times the energy equivalent of the rest mass. Overall 1250 valance quarks collide generating a hot quark-gluon soup. Heavy atomic nuclei stripped of their electron cloud are called heavy-ions, and one speaks of (ultra)relativistic heavy-ions when the kinetic energy exceeds significantly the rest mass energy, as it is the case at LHC. The outcome of such collisions is production of very many strongly interacting particles.
In August 2012 ALICE scientists announced that their experiments produced quark–gluon plasma with temperature at around 5.5 trillion degrees, the highest temperature mass achieved in any physical experiments thus far. This temperature is about 38% higher than the previous record of about 4 trillion degrees, achieved in the 2010 experiments at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The ALICE results were announced at the August 13 Quark Matter 2012 conference in Washington, D.C.. The quark–gluon plasma produced by these experiments approximates the conditions in the universe that existed microseconds after the Big Bang, before the matter coalesced into atoms.
