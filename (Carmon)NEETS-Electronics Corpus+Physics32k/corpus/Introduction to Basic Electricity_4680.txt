The arithmetic logic unit (aLu) performs math 
logic and decision-making operations. Most ALU can 
do addition and subtraction. Multiplication and divi-
sion are programmed in the control unit. The ALU 
can perform logic operations such as inversion, AND, 
OR, and exclusive OR. It can also make decisions by 
comparing numbers or test for specific quantities such 
as 0s, 1s, or negative numbers.
