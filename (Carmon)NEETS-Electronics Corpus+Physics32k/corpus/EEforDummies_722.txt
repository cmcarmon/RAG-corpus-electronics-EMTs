Because the insides of integrated circuits are 
hidden from view, it’s hard to know exactly how 
current flows when you connect a load or other 
circuitry to the IC’s output pin or pins. Typically, 
datasheets will specify how much current an IC 
output can source or sink. An output is said to 
source current when current flows out of the 
output pin, and sink current when current flows 
into the output pin.
If you connect a device, say a resistor, between 
an  output  pin  and  the  positive  terminal  of  a
