With the switch in the 100 microampere position, all the current being measured will go through the
meter movement. None of the current will go through any of the shunt resistors. If the ammeter is
switched to the 1 milliampere position, the current being measured will have parallel paths of the meter
movement and all the shunt resistors (R1 , R2, R3, and R4). Now, only a portion of the current will go
through the meter movement and the rest of the current will go through the shunt resistors. When the
meter is switched to the 10-milliampere position (as shown in fig. 1-22), only resistors R1, R2, and R3
shunt the meter. Since the resistance of the shunting resistance is less than with R4 in the circuit (as was
the case in the 1-milliampere position), more current will go through the shunt resistors and less current
will go through the meter movement. As the resistance decreases and more current goes through the shunt
resistors. As long as the current to be measured does not exceed the range selected, the meter movement
will never have more than 100 microamperes of current through it.
