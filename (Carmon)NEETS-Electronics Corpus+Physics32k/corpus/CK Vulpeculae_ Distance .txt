The distance to CK Vulpeculae cannot be determined accurately. Assumptions about its maximum possible luminosity and a position beyond known nebulosity give a distance of 550 ± 150 pc. Measurements of the expansion of the nebulosity assumed to have been produced in 1670 give a distance of 700 ± 150 pc. There are gas clouds at 500 pc and 2 kpc, but only the first is detected in the spectrum of CK Vulpeculae, placing strong constraints on the possible distance.
