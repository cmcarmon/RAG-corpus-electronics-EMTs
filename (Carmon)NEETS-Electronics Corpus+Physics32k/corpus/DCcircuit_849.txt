If, however, we were to scale the instruments (transmitter and indicator) to use a scale of
3 to 15 PSI, with 3 PSI representing 0 percent and 15 PSI representing 100 percent, any kind
of a malfunction resulting in zero air pressure at the indicator would generate a reading of -25
percent (0 PSI), which is clearly a faulty value. The person looking at the indicator would then
be able to immediately tell that something was wrong.
