p r o b l e m 3.14 You have been hired by the MITDAC Corporation to write a
product description for a new 4-bit digital-to-analog-converter resistance ladder. Because
of mask tolerances in VLSI chips, each resistor shown in Figure 3.145 is guaranteed to
if R0 is the nominal design resis-
be only within 3% of its nominal value. That is,
tance, then each resistance labeled R can have a resistance anywhere in the range
(1 ± .03)R0 and each resistance labeled 2R can have a resistance anywhere in the
range (2 ± .06)R0.
