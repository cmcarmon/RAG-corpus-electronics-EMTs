Set your multimeter to measure DC voltage, hold the black (negative) multi-
meter probe to the black lead coming out of the battery pack, and hold the 
red (positive) multimeter probe to the red lead coming out of the battery 
pack. You should get a reading of at least 6 volts, because fresh batteries 
supply a higher voltage than their rating. If the reading is much less than 
6 volts, remove the batteries and check each one individually.
