. Direct rambus DRAM (DRDRAM) is a proprietary tech-
nology proposed by Rambus in partnership with Intel. It
utilizes Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) memory platform.
This technology is expected to replace SDRAM as the
adopted standard in PCs. In 1999, Rambus reported
that its DRDRAM could deliver up to 1.6 GBPS capa-
bility. Presently, Rambus DRAM (RDRAM) is used in
products ranging from Silicon Graphics workstations to
Nintendo-64 video game machines.
