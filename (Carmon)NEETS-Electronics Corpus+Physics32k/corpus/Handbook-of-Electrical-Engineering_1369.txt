The  problem  of  speech  enhancement  has  been  a  challenge  for  many  researchers  for  almost  three  decades.
Different solutions with various degrees of success have been proposed over the years. An excellent introduction
to the problem, and review of the systems developed up until 1979, can be found in the landmark paper by Lim
and Oppenheim [1979]. A panel of the National Academy of Sciences discussed in 1988 the problem and various
ways to evaluate speech enhancement systems. The panel’s ﬁndings were summarized in Makhoul et al. [1989].
Modern statistical approaches for speech enhancement were recently reviewed in Boll [1992] and Ephraim [1992].
