In this conﬁguration, the unbypassed emitter resistor RE is obvi-
ously in series with the input circuit as well as the output circuit.
Hence, it is actually a feedback resistor and so may be given the
alternative  symbol  R F,  as  in  Fig.  24.33.  Because  all  the  output
signal voltage is fed back in series with the input, this represents
100% voltage-derived series negative feedback.
