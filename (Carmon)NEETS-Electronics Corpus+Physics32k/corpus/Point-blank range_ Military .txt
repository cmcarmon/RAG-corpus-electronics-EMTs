Known also as "battle zero", maximum point-blank range is crucial in the military. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing their weapon's sights on the center of mass of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Any height correction is not needed at the "battle zero" or less distance, however, if given, it can result either a headshot, or even a complete miss. The belt buckle is used as battle zero point of aim in Russian and former Soviet military doctrine.
The first mass produced assault rifle the World War II StG 44 and its preceding prototypes had iron sight lines elevated over the bore axis to extend point-blank range. The current trend for elevated sights and flatter shooting higher-velocity cartridges in assault rifles is in part due to a desire to further extend the maximum point-blank range, which makes the rifle easier to use. Raising the sight line 48.5 to 63.5 mm (1.9 to 2.5 in) over the bore axis, introduces an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15 to 20 m (16 to 22 yd)), the shooter must aim high in order to place shots where desired.
