During the 1970s and 1980s, a number of researchers realized
the limitations of frequency-domain integral equation solu-
tions of Maxwell’s equations. This led to early explorations of a
novel alternative approach: direct time-domain solutions of
Maxwell’s differential (curl) equations on spatial grids or lat-
tices. The ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method,
introduced by Yee (1966), was the ﬁrst technique in this class
and has remained the subject of continuous development
(Taﬂove and Hagness [2000]).
