Some practical solutions have been developed to remedy
these shortcomings of the parallel-line coupler. Figure 7.22
shows a class of commonly used parallel-line couplers including
edge, broadside, and interdigital multiconductor couplings.
The De Ronde coupler may be regarded as a special type of
coupler that uses both sides of a substrate (Hoffmann, 1987)
employing a combination of coupled microstrip and slot lines
to ease the tight coupling problem. On the other hand, the
interdigital Lange coupler is most noteworthy since it combines
the features of both a 90 hybrid and a parallel-line coupler. It
usually uses l=4 coupled microstrip-line sections for a 3-dB
design. The Lange coupler has the advantage of small size,
relatively large coupled line spacing, and wide bandwidth.
