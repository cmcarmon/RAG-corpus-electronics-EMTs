You already know the voltage drop across a fixed resistor remains constant unless the current 
flowing through it varies (increases or decreases). In a shunt regulator, as shown in figure 4-33, output 
voltage regulation is determined by the current through the parallel resistance of the regulating device 
(RV), the load resistance (RL), and the series resistor (RS). For now, assume that the circuit is operating 
under normal conditions, that the input is 120 volts dc, and that the desired regulated output is 100 volts 
dc. For a 100-volt output to be maintained, 20 volts must be dropped across the series resistor (RS). If you 
assume that the value of RS is 2 ohms, you must have 10 amperes of current through RV and R L. 
(Remember: E = IR.) If the values of the resistance of R V and RL are equal, 5 amperes of current will 
flow through each resistance (RV and RL).
