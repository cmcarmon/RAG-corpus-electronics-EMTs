The a.c. performance of an amplifier stage can be 
predicted  using  a  load  line  superimposed  on  the 
relevant set of output characteristics. For a bipolar 
transistor  operating  in  common-emitter  mode  the 
required  characteristics  are  IC plotted  against  VCE 
One end of the load line corresponds to the supply 
voltage  (VCC) while  the  other  end  corresponds  to 
the  value  of  collector  or  drain  current  that  would 
flow  with  the  device  totally  saturated.  In  this 
condition:
