The results of the experiment are shown plotted in 
graphical  form  in  Fig.  A8.8.  Note  that  the  graph 
consists of a straight line but that it does not pass 
through  the  origin  of  the  graph  (i.e.  the  point  at 
which t and V are 0°C and 0 V respectively). The 
second most important feature to note (after having 
noticed  that  the  graph  is  a  straight  line)  is  that, 
when t = 0°C, R = 100 W. 
  By  looking  at  the  graph  we  could  suggest  a 
relationship (i.e. an equation) that will allow us to 
find  the  resistance,  R, of  the  component  at  any 
given temperature, t. The relationship is simply: 
R =
If  you  need  to  check  that  this  works,  just  try 
inserting a few pairs of values from those given in
