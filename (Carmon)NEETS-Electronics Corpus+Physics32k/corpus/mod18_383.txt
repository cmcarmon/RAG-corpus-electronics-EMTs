The iagc circuit is essentially a wide-band, dc amplifier. It instantaneously controls the gain of the IF
amplifier as the radar return signal changes in amplitude. The effect of iagc is to allow full amplification
of weak signals and to decrease the amplification of strong signals. The range of iagc is limited, however,
by the number of IF stages in which gain is controlled. When only one IF stage is controlled, the range of
iagc is limited to approximately 20 dB. When more than one IF stage is controlled, iagc range can be
increased to approximately 40 dB.
