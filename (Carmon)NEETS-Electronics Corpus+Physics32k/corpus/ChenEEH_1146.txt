The small actuators that result from MEMS technology are
also useful for switching microwave-frequency electronic sig-
nals on chips. Micromechanisms can be employed to make
tunable capacitors and resonators for manipulation of such
signals. These technologies for the microwave and nearby
frequencies are now under intense development and should
come to market within a few years. Such devices are expected
to have major impacts on wireless communication systems and
short-range radars for automobile collision avoidance, among
other products.
