Welcome to the world of circuit layout — figuring out where everything 
should go on the board so it all fits together and is neat, tidy, and error‐free. 
Don’t expect your circuit layout to look exactly like your schematic — doing 
so is not only difficult but usually impractical. You can, however, orient your 
key circuit elements so your circuit is easier to understand and debug.
