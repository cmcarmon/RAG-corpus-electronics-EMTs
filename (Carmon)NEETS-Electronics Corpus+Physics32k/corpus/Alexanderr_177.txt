Keep  in  mind  that  superposition  is  based  on  linearity.  For  this
reason, it is not applicable to the effect on power due to each source,
because  the  power  absorbed  by  a  resistor  depends  on  the  square  of
the  voltage  or  current.  If  the  power  value  is  needed,  the  current
through (or voltage across) the element must be calculated Ô¨Årst using
superposition.
