Fawcett (1994) describes several applications that have been
implemented using reconﬁgurable logic. He has categorized
the applications based on how the FPGAs are reconﬁgured.
These categories are systems with built-in diagnostics, adapt-
able systems, and multi-purpose hardware. The examples
provided are all implemented using nonpartially reconﬁgur-
able FPGAs. By using appropriate tools (2000), designers can
retarget these designs on partially reconﬁgurable FPGAs. For
instance, system diagnostics can be performed by partially
reconﬁguring a portion of the FPGA to perform a boundary
scan operation, while the rest of the design continues to oper-
ate. An example of an adaptable system that is partially recon-
ﬁgurable is a network card that changes its back-end functions
to support different protocols and that keeps its front-end bus
interface functional to service the host’s demands.
