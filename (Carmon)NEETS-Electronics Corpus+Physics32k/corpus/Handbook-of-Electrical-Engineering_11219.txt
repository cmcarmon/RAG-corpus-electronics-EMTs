Power spectral analysis not only provides a summary of the EEG in a convenient
graphic form, but also facilitates statistical analysis of EEG changes which may not
be  evident  on  simple  inspection  of  the  records.  In  addition  to  absolute  power
derived directly from the power spectrum, other measures calculated from absolute
power have been demonstrated to be of value in quantifying various aspects of the
EEG. Relative power expresses the percent contribution of each frequency band to
the total power and is calculated by dividing the power within a band by the total
power across all bands. Relative power has the beneﬁt of reducing the intersubject
variance  associated  with  absolute  power  that  arises  from  intersubject  differences
in  skull  and  scalp  conductance.  The  disadvantage  of  relative  power  is  that  an
increase in one frequency band will be reﬂected in the calculation by a decrease in
other bands; for example, it has been reported that directional shifts between high
and low frequencies are associated with changes in cerebral blood ﬂow and metab-
olism. Power ratios between low (0–7 Hz) and high (10–20 Hz) frequency bands
have been demonstrated to be an accurate estimator of changes in cerebral activity
during these metabolic changes.
