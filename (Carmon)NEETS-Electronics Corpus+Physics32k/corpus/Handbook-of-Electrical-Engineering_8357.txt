these  paths  within  a  speciﬁed  propagational  delay  time  between  the  initiation  of  a  signal  transition  at  the
beginning of the path and the arrival of the ﬁnal values at the end of that path. This is called path-delay testing.
A modern IC component with typical complexity would contain many hundreds of thousands of logic paths,
so  that  it  becomes  impractical  to  test  all  of  them  for  at-speed  operation. All  synchronous  digital  circuits  are
designed so that there is a ﬁxed clock period resulting from the use-constant frequency clock signals to time
their operation. Obviously, the clock period constitutes an upper bound for the propagational delay through
any logic path, since otherwise clock pulses may arrive at the ﬂip-ﬂops while their data input signals may still
be transitioning. On the other hand, propagational delay through some logic paths may be very close to this
upper bound (i.e., clock period) value whereas others may have more slack in them. It is therefore important
to identify the critical paths and perform path-delay testing on these. Hence path-delay testing can be broken
into the two phases of critical-path selection and path-delay test pattern generation.
