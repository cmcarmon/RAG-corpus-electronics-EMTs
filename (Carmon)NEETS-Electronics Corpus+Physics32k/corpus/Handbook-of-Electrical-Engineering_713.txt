where Vi(s)  is  the  transform  of  vi(t).The  transformed  voltages  thus  satisfy  Kirchhoff ’s  voltage  law. A  similar
procedure will show that transformed currents satisfy Kirchhoff ’s current law, as well. Next, let us consider the
passive elements. For a resistance R, with current iR and voltage vR, for which
