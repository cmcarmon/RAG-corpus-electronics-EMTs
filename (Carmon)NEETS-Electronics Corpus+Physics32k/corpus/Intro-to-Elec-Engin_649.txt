The motion of the load line traces the shaded area of the characteristics. The line segment
Q1Q2 is the locus of the position of the operating point Q. It is clear from the Ô¨Ågures that the
waveforms of the diode voltage and current are functions of time. A point-by-point method
should be used for plotting the waveforms. For the small-signal case, the diode can be considered
to behave linearly and the segment Q1Q2 is approximated by a straight line. For the large-signal
case, on the other hand, the behavior is nonlinear. The time-varying portion of the response is not
directly proportional to vS(t), and a simple superposition of the direct and alternating responses
does not apply.
