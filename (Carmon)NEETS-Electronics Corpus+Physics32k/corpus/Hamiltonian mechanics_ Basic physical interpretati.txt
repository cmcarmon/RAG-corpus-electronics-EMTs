A simple interpretation of the Hamiltonian mechanics comes from its application on a one-dimensional system consisting of one particle of mass m. The Hamiltonian represents the total energy of the system, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, traditionally denoted T and V, respectively. Here q is the space coordinate and p is the momentum mv. Then

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}=T+V\quad ,\quad T={\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}\quad ,\quad V=V(q)}

Note that T is a function of p alone, while V is a function of q alone (i.e., T and V are scleronomic).
In this example, the time derivative of the momentum p equals the Newtonian force, and so the first Hamilton equation means that the force equals the negative gradient of potential energy. The time-derivative of q is the velocity, and so the second Hamilton equation means that the particleâ€™s velocity equals the derivative of its kinetic energy with respect to its momentum.
