In fsk the output is abruptly changed between two differing frequencies by opening and closing the
key. This is shown in view (D). For illustrative purposes, the spacing frequency in view (D) is shown as
double the marking frequency. However, in practice the difference is usually less than 1,000 hertz, even
when operating at several megahertz. You should also note that the limit of frequency shift is determined
without reference to the amplitude of the keying signal in the fsk system. The frequency shift may be set
at plus or minus 425 hertz from the allocated channel frequency. The total shift between mark and space
would be 850 hertz. Either the mark or space may use the higher of the two frequencies. The upper
frequency of the transmitted signal is usually the spacing interval and the lower frequency is the marking
interval.
