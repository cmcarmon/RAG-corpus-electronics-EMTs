An amplifier can handle only a limited range of input amplitudes before it begins to distort the
signal. Signal distortion is prevented in oscilloscopes by the incorporation of circuitry that permits
adjustment of the input signal amplitude to a level that prevents distortion from occurring. This
adjustment is called the ATTENUATOR control in some scopes (VOLTS/DIV and VAR in figure 6-19).
This control extends the usefulness of the oscilloscope by enabling it to handle a wide range of signal
amplitudes.
