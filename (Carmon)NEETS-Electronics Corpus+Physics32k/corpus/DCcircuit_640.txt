A meter is any device built to accurately detect and display an electrical quantity in a form
readable by a human being. Usually this ”readable form” is visual: motion of a pointer on
a scale, a series of lights arranged to form a ”bargraph,” or some sort of display composed
of numerical ﬁgures.
In the analysis and testing of circuits, there are meters designed to
accurately measure the basic quantities of voltage, current, and resistance. There are many
other types of meters as well, but this chapter primarily covers the design and operation of the
basic three.
