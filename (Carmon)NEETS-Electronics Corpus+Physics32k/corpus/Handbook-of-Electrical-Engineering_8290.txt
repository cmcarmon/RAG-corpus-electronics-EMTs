In  the  process  of  computing  a  signature  for  testing  the  circuit,  the  input  stream  to  the  LFSR  used  as  a
compactor is the output stream from the circuit under test. At the end of the testing cycles, only the last state
of the LFSR is examined and considered to be the compacted signature of the circuit. In most real cases, circuits
have many outputs, and the LFSR is converted into a multiple-input shift register (MISR). A MISR is constructed
by  adding  EXOR  gates  to  the  input  of  some  or  all  the  ﬂip-ﬂop  cells;  the  outputs  of  the  circuit  are  then  fed
through these gates into the compactor. The probability of aliasing for a MISR is the same as that of an LFSR;
