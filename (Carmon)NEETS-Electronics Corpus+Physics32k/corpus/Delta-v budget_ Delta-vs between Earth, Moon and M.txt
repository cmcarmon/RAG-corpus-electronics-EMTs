Delta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets.
Abbreviations key
Escape orbits with low pericentre – C3 = 0
Geostationary orbit – GEO
Geostationary transfer orbit – GTO
Earth–Moon L5 Lagrangian point – L5
low Earth orbit – LEO
Lunar orbit means low lunar orbit
Red arrows show where optional aerobraking/aerocapture can be performed in that particular direction, black numbers give delta-v in km/s that apply in either direction. Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: fuzzy orbital transfers.
Electric propulsion vehicles going from Mars C3 = 0 to Earth C3 = 0 without using the Oberth effect need a larger Delta-v of between 2.6 km/s and 3.15 km/s. Not all possible links are shown.
The Delta-v for C3 = 0 to Mars transfer must be applied at pericentre, i.e. immediately after accelerating to the escape trajectory, and do not agree with the formula above which gives 0.4 from Earth escape and 0.65 from Mars escape.
The figures for LEO to GTO, GTO to GEO, and LEO to GEO are inconsistent. The figure of 30 for LEO to the sun is also too high.
