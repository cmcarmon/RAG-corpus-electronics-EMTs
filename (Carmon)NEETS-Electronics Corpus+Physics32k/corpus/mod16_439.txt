The multimeter is equipped with a pair of test leads; red is the positive lead and black is the negative,
or common, lead. Eight jacks are located on the lower part of the front panel. To prepare the meter for
use, simply insert the test leads into the proper jacks to obtain the circuit and range desired for each
application. In most applications, the black lead will be inserted into the jack marked at the lower left with
a negative sign ( - ) or with the word COMMON.
