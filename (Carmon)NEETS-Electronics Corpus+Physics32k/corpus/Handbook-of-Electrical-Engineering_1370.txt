In this section the principles and performance of the major speech enhancement approaches are reviewed,
and the advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed. The signal is assumed to be corrupted
by additive statistically independent noise. Only a single noisy version of the clean signal is assumed available
for  enhancement.  Furthermore,  it  is  assumed  that  the  clean  signal  cannot  be  preprocessed  to  increase  its
robustness prior to being affected by the noise. Speech enhancement systems which can either preprocess the
clean speech signal or which have access to multiple versions of the noisy signal obtained from a number of
microphones are discussed in Lim [1983].
