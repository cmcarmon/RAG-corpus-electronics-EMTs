Typical strain gauge resistances range from 30 Ω to 3 kΩ (unstressed). This resistance may
change only a fraction of a percent for the full force range of the gauge, given the limitations
imposed by the elastic limits of the gauge material and of the test specimen. Forces great
enough to induce greater resistance changes would permanently deform the test specimen
and/or the gauge conductors themselves, thus ruining the gauge as a measurement device.
Thus, in order to use the strain gauge as a practical instrument, we must measure extremely
small changes in resistance with high accuracy.
