Fresnel or near ﬁeld: The propagation region where the normalized radiation pattern can be calculated using
quadratic approximations to the spherical Huygens’ wavelet surfaces. The pattern can depend on distance
from  the  source  and  is  usually  valid  for  distances  greater  than  (p/4l)1/3L2/3,  where  L  is  the  largest
dimension of the antenna.
