Transmission Line Sections
The simplest microwave circuit element is a uniform section of transmission line which can be used to introduce
a  time  delay  or  a  frequency-dependent  phase  shift.  Other  line  segments  for  interconnections  include  bends,
corners, twists, and transitions between lines of different dimensions (see Fig. 39.3). The dimensions and shapes
are designed to minimize reï¬‚ections and so maximize return loss and minimize insertion loss.
