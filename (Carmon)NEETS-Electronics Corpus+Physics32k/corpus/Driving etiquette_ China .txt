Driving etiquette is still in its early stages in China, where people have driven vehicles for well over 3,000 years. As a result, traffic can at times be chaotic, and some road courtesies are often ignored. Taxi and bus drivers will commonly aim their vehicles at pedestrians in order to get them to move out of the way more quickly, with regular honking of car horns the norm.
