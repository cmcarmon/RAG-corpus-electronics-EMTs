In many applications, there is a need to increase or decrease
the sampling rate of a discrete-time signal directly in the
discrete-time domain without reconstructing the continuous-
time signal. These tasks are referred to as interpolation and
decimation. These are basic operations needed in multirate
signal processing, Ô¨Ålter banks, and sub-band/wavelet analysis
(Akansu et al., 1996; Strang and Nguyen, 1996; Vaidyanathan,
1993; Vetterli and Kovacevic, 1995).
