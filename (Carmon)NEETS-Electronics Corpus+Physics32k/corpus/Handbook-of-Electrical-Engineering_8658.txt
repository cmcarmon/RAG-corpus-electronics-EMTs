The SPARC is explicit about where to store the subtractionâ€”in %g0. %g0 is a pseudo-register. It is
always a 0 as a source and is a garbage can as a destination. The availability of the 0 and the garbage
can serves all the same functions that the special instructions for zeros and comparisons do on the CISCs.
