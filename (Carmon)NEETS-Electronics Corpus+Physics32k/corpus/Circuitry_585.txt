Problems 
 
12.1   Design  a  timer  circuit  that  will  produce  a  
10  V  2  ms  pulse  when  a  10  V  negative-
 
 
going trigger pulse is applied to it. 
12.2   Design a timer circuit that will produce time 
periods that can be varied from 1 s to 10 s. 
 
The  timer  circuit  is  to  produce  a  +12V 
 
 
output.
