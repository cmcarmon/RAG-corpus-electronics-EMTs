In contrast to the Chinese model (dubbed the socialist market economy), the Vietnamese system is not officially viewed as a form of socialism or even market socialism; it is considered to be a multi-sectoral market economy that is in the process of undergoing a long-term transition towards socialism, with the view that socialism can only emerge once Vietnam's productive forces are developed to a point where socialism becomes a technical possibility.
The socialist-oriented market economy has aroused less controversy than the Chinese model within its perspective government because private business plays a smaller role in the Vietnamese model, with most of the means of production remaining firmly under either collective or state ownership and administration.
