In semiconductors, the Shockley diode equation—the relationship between the flow of electric current and the electrostatic potential across a p–n junction—depends on a characteristic voltage called the thermal voltage, denoted VT. The thermal voltage depends on absolute temperature T as

{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {T} }={kT \over q},}

where q is the magnitude of the electrical charge on the electron with a value 1.6021766208(98)×10−19 C and k is the Boltzmann constant, 1.380648521(79)×10−23 J/K. In electronvolts, the Boltzmann constant is 8.6173303(50)×10−5 eV/K, making it easy to calculate that at room temperature (≈ 300 K), the value of the thermal voltage is approximately 25.85 millivolts ≈ 26 mV. The thermal voltage is also important in plasmas and electrolyte solutions; in both cases it provides a measure of how much the spatial distribution of electrons or ions is affected by a boundary held at a fixed voltage.
