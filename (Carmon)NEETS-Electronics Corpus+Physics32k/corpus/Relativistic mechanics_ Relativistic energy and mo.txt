There are a couple of (equivalent) ways to define momentum and energy in SR. One method uses conservation laws. If these laws are to remain valid in SR they must be true in every possible reference frame. However, if one does some simple thought experiments using the Newtonian definitions of momentum and energy, one sees that these quantities are not conserved in SR. One can rescue the idea of conservation by making some small modifications to the definitions to account for relativistic velocities. It is these new definitions which are taken as the correct ones for momentum and energy in SR.
The four-momentum of an object is straightforward, identical in form to the classical momentum, but replacing 3-vectors with 4-vectors:






P


=

m

0




U


=
(
E

/

c
,

p

)


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathbf {P} }}=m_{0}{\boldsymbol {\mathbf {U} }}=(E/c,\mathbf {p} )}

The energy and momentum of an object with invariant mass m0 (also called rest mass), moving with velocity v with respect to a given frame of reference, are respectively given by








E



=
γ
(

v

)

m

0



c

2







p




=
γ
(

v

)

m

0



v







{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}E&=\gamma (\mathbf {v} )m_{0}c^{2}\\\mathbf {p} &=\gamma (\mathbf {v} )m_{0}\mathbf {v} \end{aligned}}}

The factor of γ(v) comes from the definition of the four-velocity described above. The appearance of the γ factor has an alternative way of being stated, explained in the next section.
The kinetic energy, K, is defined as




K

{\displaystyle K=(\gamma -1)m_{0}c^{2}=E-m_{0}c^{2}\,,}

And the speed as a function of kinetic energy is given by
