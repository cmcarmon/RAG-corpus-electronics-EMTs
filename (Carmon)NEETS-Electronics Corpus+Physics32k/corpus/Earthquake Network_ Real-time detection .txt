In order to be effective, the earthquake warning system of the Earthquake Network project is expected to detect the earthquake as fast as possible. Earthquake detection is performed by the real-time analysis of the data that the smartphone network sends to the central server. Since smartphones detect accelerations not necessarily induced by an earthquake, the server implements a statistical algorithm which is able to recognize real earthquakes from the background noise. The statistical methodology at the basis of the algorithm allows to control the probability of false alarm. Development stage: released.
