of linear systems, and therefore superposition applies. In particular, suppose these component signals are
complex exponentials, each of which has a frequency diﬀerent from the others. The transfer function portrays
how the circuit aﬀects the amplitude and phase of each component, allowing us to understand how the circuit
works on a complicated signal. Those components having a frequency less than the cutoﬀ frequency pass
through the circuit with little modiﬁcation while those having higher frequencies are suppressed. The circuit
is said to act as a ﬁlter, ﬁltering the source signal based on the frequency of each component complex
exponential. Because low frequencies pass through the ﬁlter, we call it a lowpass ﬁlter to express more
precisely its function.
