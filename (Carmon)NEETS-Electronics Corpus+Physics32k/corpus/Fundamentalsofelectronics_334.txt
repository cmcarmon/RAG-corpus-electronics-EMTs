(b) What is the circuit’s output when the input voltage is sin (2πf t), with f = 4kHz?
(c) What circuit could perform the opposite function to your answer for the ﬁrst part?
Problem 3.48: Active Filter
Find the transfer function of the active ﬁlter depicted Figure 3.87.
Problem 3.49: This is a ﬁlter?
You are given a circuit as shown in Figure 3.88.
(a) What is this circuit’s transfer function? Plot the magnitude and phase.
(b) If the input signal is the sinusoid sin (2πf0t), what will the output be when f0 is larger than the ﬁlter’s
