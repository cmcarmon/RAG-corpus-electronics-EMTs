Low-power TV (LPTV): A television service authorized by the FCC to serve speciﬁc conﬁned areas. An LPTV
station may typically radiate between 100 and 1000 W of power, covering a geographic radius of 10 to 15 mi.
Multistage depressed collector (MSDC) klystron: A specially designed klystron in which decreasing voltage
zones cause the electron beam to be reduced in velocity before striking the collector element. The effect
is to reduce the amount of heat that must be dissipated by the device, improving operating efﬁciency.
