An approach to this problem that has yielded satisfactory
results is shifting track assignments of nets (a process called net
bumping) for accommodating the CSs needed for reconﬁgu-
ration and ‘‘reﬁtting’’ the bumped nets on other track pos-
itions. For simplicity of exposition, we describe this ‘‘bump-
and-reﬁt’’ (B&R) algorithm in the context of track segment
lengths of one.
