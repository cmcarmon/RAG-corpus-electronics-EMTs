Stockpiling soldering equipment
Soldering (pronounced “SOD‐er‐ing”) is the method you use to make semiper-
manent connections between components as you build a circuit. Instead of 
using glue to hold things together, you use small globs of molten metal called 
solder applied by a device called a soldering iron. The metal provides a con-
ductive physical joint, known as a solder joint, between the wires and compo-
nent leads of your circuit.
