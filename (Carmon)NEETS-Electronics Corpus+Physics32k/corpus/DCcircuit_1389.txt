Ltotal = L1 + L2 + . . . Ln
When inductors are connected in parallel, the total inductance is less than any one of the
parallel inductors’ inductances. Again, remember that the deﬁnitive measure of inductance is
the amount of voltage dropped across an inductor for a given rate of current change through
it. Since the current through each parallel inductor will be a fraction of the total current, and
the voltage across each parallel inductor will be equal, a change in total current will result
in less voltage dropped across the parallel array than for any one of the inductors considered
separately. In other words, there will be less voltage dropped across parallel inductors for a
given rate of change in current than for any of those inductors considered separately, because
total current divides among parallel branches. Less voltage for the same rate of change in
current means less inductance.
