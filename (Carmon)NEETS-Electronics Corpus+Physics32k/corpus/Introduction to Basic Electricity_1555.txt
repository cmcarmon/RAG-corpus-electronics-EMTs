In electronics, electrical ground serves a different 
purpose: Ground is defined as the zero reference point 
against which all voltages are measured. Therefore, the 
voltage at any point in a circuit may be measured with 
reference to ground. The voltage measured may be 
positive or negative with respect to ground.
