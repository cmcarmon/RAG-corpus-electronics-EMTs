Shield Testing
The most common speciﬁcation used for shield evaluation is the procedure given in MIL-STD-285. This consists
of  establishing  a  reference  level  without  the  shield  and  then  enclosing  the  receiver  within  the  shield  and
determining the difference. The ratio is the shielding effectiveness. This applies regardless of materials used in
the construction of the shield. Care must be taken in evaluating the results since the measured value is a function
of a variety of factors, not all of which are deﬁnable.
