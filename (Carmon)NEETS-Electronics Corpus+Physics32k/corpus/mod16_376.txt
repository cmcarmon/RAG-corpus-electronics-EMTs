Let’s assume that you have changed the range switch to the R ·  10 position and the pointer now
deflects to a reading of 375 ohms, as shown in view B of figure 3-14. This would indicate to you that
unknown resistance Rx has 3,750 (375 times 10) ohms of resistance. The change of range caused the
deflection because resistor R ·  10 has only 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  1. Therefore, selecting the
smaller series resistance allowed a battery current of sufficient value to cause a readable pointer
deflection. If the R ·  100 range were used to measure the same 3,750 ohm resistor, the pointer would
deflect still further to the 37.5-ohm position, as shown in view C. This increased deflection would occur
because resistor R ·  100 has only 1/10 the resistance of resistor R ·  10.
