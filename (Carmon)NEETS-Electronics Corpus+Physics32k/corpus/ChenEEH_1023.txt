FIGURE 5.14
Indicates that the Battery Life Depends on the Amount of Average Current Discharged, Noting that the Charging Process was
Identical in the Three Cases and More Current Means More Power Withdrawn; the Ô¨Ågure shows three different average discharge currents
values: 130 mA, 650 mA, and 1300 mA. The 130 mA average discharge current gave the longest discharge time of all three and the 1300 mA
average discharge current gave the shortest time.
