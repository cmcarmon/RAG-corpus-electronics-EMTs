For a B-bit organized RAM with a capacity of 2k words, the
ﬂoor plan in Figure 2.5 is the basis for everything. Notice the
presence of read and write ampliﬁers that are necessary to
drive or sense the (very) long bit-lines in the vertical direction.
Notice also the presence of write-enable (WE) signal for con-
trolling the R/W option and a chip select (CS) control signal
that is mainly used to save power.
