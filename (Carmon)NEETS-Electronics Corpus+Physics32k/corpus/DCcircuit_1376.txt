When the switch is opened, however, it suddenly introduces an extremely high resistance
into the circuit (the resistance of the air gap between the contacts). This sudden introduction
of high resistance into the circuit causes the circuit current to decrease almost instantly. Math-
ematically, the di/dt term will be a very large negative number. Such a rapid change of current
(from some magnitude to zero in very little time) will induce a very high voltage across the
inductor, oriented with negative on the left and positive on the right, in an effort to oppose this
decrease in current. The voltage produced is usually more than enough to light the neon lamp,
if only for a brief moment until the current decays to zero:
