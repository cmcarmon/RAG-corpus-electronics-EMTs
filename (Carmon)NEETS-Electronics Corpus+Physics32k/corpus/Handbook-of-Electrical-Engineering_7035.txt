Thus, a data compressor (sometimes called a source coder) maps an information source into a sequence of
bits,  with  a  corresponding  decompressor,  that  given  these  bits  provides  a  reconstruction  of  the  source.  Data
compression systems can be classiÔ¨Åed into two types: lossless, where the reconstruction is exactly equal to the
original  source,  and  lossy,  where  the  reconstruction  is  a  distorted  version  of  the  original  source.  For  lossless
data compression, the fundamental lower bound on the rate of the data compression system is given by the
entropy rate of the source. For lossy data compression, we have a tradeoff between the rate of the compressor
and the distortion we incur, and the fundamental limit is given by the rate distortion function, which is discussed
later in this section.
