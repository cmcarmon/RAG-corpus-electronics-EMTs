Public-key encryption scheme: A scheme to generate pairs of encryption-decryption keys to that encryption
and decryption of messages can be executed efÔ¨Åciently when knowing the corresponding key, but it is
infeasible to gain any information of the message given only the encrypted message and the encryption
key (but not the decryption key).
