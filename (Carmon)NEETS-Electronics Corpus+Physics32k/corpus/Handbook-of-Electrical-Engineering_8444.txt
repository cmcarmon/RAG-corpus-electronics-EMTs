Floating-Point Number Systems
In  ﬁxed-point  representation  [Eq.  (86.1)],  the  radix  point  is  assumed  to  lie  immediately  to  the  right  of  the
integer ﬁeld and at the left end of the fraction ﬁeld. The ﬁxed-point system is the most commonly used system
for  representing  bounded  orders  of  magnitude.  For  example,  with  32  bits  a  binary  number  could  represent
decimal numbers with upper and lower bounds of the order of –1010 and –10–10. However, for greatly expanded
bounds of representation, as in scientiﬁc notation, the ﬂoating-point representation is needed.
