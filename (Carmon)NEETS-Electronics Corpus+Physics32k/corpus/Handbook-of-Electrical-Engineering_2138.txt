i.e.,  the  PE  weights  and  the  bias  control  the  orientation  and  position  of  the  separation  line,  respectively
(Fig. 20.4). In many dimensions the separation surface becomes an hyperplane of dimension one less than the
dimensionality of the input space. So, each PE creates a dichotomy in the input space. For smooth nonlinearities
the separation surface is not crisp; it becomes fuzzy but the same principles apply. In this case, the size of the
weights controls the width of the fuzzy boundary (larger weights shrink the fuzzy boundary).
