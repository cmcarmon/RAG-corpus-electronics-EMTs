The transmitter of a radar is designed to operate within a limited band of frequencies at an optimum 
power level. Operation at frequencies or power levels outside the assigned band greatly decreases the 
efficiency of the transmitter and may cause interference with other radars. Therefore, transmitter 
performance must be monitored closely for both frequency and output power.
