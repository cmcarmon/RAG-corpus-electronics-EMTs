8.1   Sketch the circuit symbol for an operational 
 
8.2   List  four  characteristics  associated  with  an 
 
8.3   An  operational  amplifier  with  negative 
feedback  applied  produces  an  output  of  
 
1.5  V  when  an  input  of  7.5  mV  is  present. 
 
 
Determine the closed-loop voltage gain. 
8.4   Sketch  the  circuit  of  an  inverting  amplifier 
based  on  an  operational  amplifier.  Label 
 
your circuit and identify the components that 
 
 
determine the closed-loop voltage gain. 
 8.5   Sketch  the  circuit  of  each  of  the  following 
 
 
 
 
8.6   An  inverting  amplifier  is  to  be  constructed 
having  a  mid-band  voltage  gain  of  40,  an 
 
input 
 
a 
 
frequency response extending from 20 Hz to 
20  kHz.  Devise  a  circuit  and  specify  all 
 
 
component values required. 
8.7  A  summing  amplifier  with  two  inputs  has 
RF = 10  kG, and  RIN  (for  both  inputs)  of  
 
 
2  kG. Determine  the  output  voltage  when 
 
one input is at *2 V and the other is +0.5 V. 
8.8  During  measurements  on  an  operational 
amplifier  under  open-loop  conditions,  an 
 
 
output  voltage    of  12  V  is  produced  by  an 
input voltage of 1 mV. Determine the open-
 
 
loop voltage gain expressed in dB. 
8.9  With  the  aid  of  a  sketch,  explain  what  is 
 
meant  by  the  term  ‘slew  rate’.  Why  is  this 
 
important?
