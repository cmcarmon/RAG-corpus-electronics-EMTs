As the electrons flow through the circuit, they en-
counter a load, some resistance to the flow of elec-
trons. As electrons flow through the load, they give up 
their energy. The energy given up is called a voltage 
drop (Figure 12-24). The energy is given up in most 
cases as heat. The energy that the electrons give up to a 
circuit is the energy given to them by the source.
