The pole-pair per kHz rule is based on the fact that speech
spectra tend to have about one formant (which can ordinarily
be modeled by a resonant pole pair) per kHz (Fant, 1956). The
supplemental poles are needed in the voiced case to account
for the glottal shaping ﬁlter and to generally allow some
ﬂexibility in ﬁtting the model to the speech spectrum.
