In the classic World of Darkness, the Storyteller dictated a Target Number which was a number a player needed to roll at or above on his dice in order to generate a Success. The standard Target Number in the previous World of Darkness systems was 6, equaling a 50% success chance for an individual die, with a sliding scale for difficulty. The Exalted, Scion Trinity systems use a flat target number of 7 for almost all rolls.
A more dramatic variant is the Mind's Eye Theatre system, which is designed for LARP rather than tabletop roleplaying.
