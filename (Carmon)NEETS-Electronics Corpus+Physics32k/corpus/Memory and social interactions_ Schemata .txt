One way memory can affect social interactions is through schemata. A schema is a mental structure implemented in order to sort knowledge into central themes or subjects. Although schemata develop from experience, not all experiences are organized with schemata. Schemata can influence the way in which new people and situations are understood, which has a direct effect on social interaction.
Many research studies have been conducted concerning the effect of schemata on individuals' perceptions of others. It has been found that preschoolers are aware of gender schemata and are capable of pointing out behaviours which are inconsistent with them. In a Canadian study, participants were asked to rate various diverse groups based on how well a given characteristic applied to them. The results confirmed that participants were quicker to assign a rating if the given characteristics fit the schema for that group.
Schemata have been proposed as a way to explain the persistence of stereotypes. According to this theory, negative stereotypes persist because information that is incongruent with a schema is not organized and thus less likely to be remembered. Therefore, schemata influence what information is encoded and retrieved from memory, thereby influencing social interactions.
