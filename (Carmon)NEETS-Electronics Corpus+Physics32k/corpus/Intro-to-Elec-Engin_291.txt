The two-port network (or two-terminal-pair network) shown in Figure 3.4.10 is described
by port currents and voltages (i.e., four variables) related by a set of linear equations in terms of
two-port parameters. Of the six possible parameter sets, the three used extensively in electronic
circuit analysis are given next in the frequency domain.
