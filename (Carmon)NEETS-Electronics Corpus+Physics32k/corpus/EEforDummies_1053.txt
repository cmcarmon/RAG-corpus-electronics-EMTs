Donâ€™t worry about urban sprawl on your breadboard. You do better to 
place components a little farther apart than to jam them too close together. 
Keeping a lot of distance between ICs and components also helps you to 
tweak and refine the circuit. You can more easily add parts without disturb-
ing the existing ones.
