If  you  have  no  idea  what  career  you  should  pursue  after  gradua-
tion,  a  graduate  degree  program  will  enhance  your  ability  to  explore
career options. Since your undergraduate degree will only provide you
with  the  fundamentals  of  engineering,  a  Master’s  degree  in  engineer-
ing  supplemented  by  business  courses  beneﬁts  more  engineering  stu-
dents than does getting a Master’s of Business Administration (MBA).
The  best  time  to  get  your  MBA is  after  you  have  been  a  practicing
engineer  for  some  years  and  decide  your  career  path  would  be
enhanced by strengthening your business skills.
