When you check a lead-acid type of storage battery for its condition of charge or discharge, you take
a specific gravity reading of the electrolyte by using a hydrometer. A specific gravity reading between
1.275 and 1.300 indicates a full-charge condition and assures you that the battery is in good condition. A
hydrometer reading of approximately 1.175 indicates a normal discharge condition, and a reading of
approximately 1.250 indicates that the battery is half-discharged. Since the acids used in various batteries
do not always have the same specific gravity and since electrode composition may differ, the hydrometer
reading you obtain at the charged and discharged conditions will vary with the type of electrolyte and
battery composition. A general rule for you to follow is not to discharge a battery more than 100 points
(.100 specific gravity) before recharging.
