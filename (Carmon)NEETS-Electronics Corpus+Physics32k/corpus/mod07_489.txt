The LC filter provides good filtering action over a wide range of currents. The capacitor filters best 
when the load is drawing little current. Thus, the capacitor discharges very slowly and the output voltage 
remains almost constant. On the other hand, the inductor filters best when the current is highest. The 
complementary nature of these two components ensures that good filtering will occur over a wide range 
of currents.
