The sensor is not the only thing needed to form an image in an imaging system. The sensor must have some
spatial extent before an image is formed. By spatial extent we mean that the sensor must not be a simple point
source  examining  only  one  location  of  energy  output.  To  explain  this  further,  let  us  examine  two  types  of
imaging sensors used in imaging: a CCD video camera and the ultrasound transducer used in many medical
imaging applications.
