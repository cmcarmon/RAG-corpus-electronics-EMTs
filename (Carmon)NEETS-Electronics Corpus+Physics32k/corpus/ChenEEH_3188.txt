The big disadvantage of grease coatings is the short time
interval (typically less than 1 to 2 years) between subsequent
applications to prevent any contamination-related outages.
During this time, the grease becomes saturated with dirt and
loses its water repellency. Removal of spent grease is labor
intensive, involving the use of dry cleaning agents and followed
by water washing. Failure to remove the spent grease can lead
to heavy surface arcing that can cause the porcelain insulator
to crack. In addition, in some countries like the United States,
disposal of spent grease is becoming increasingly difÔ¨Åcult due
to environmental issues
