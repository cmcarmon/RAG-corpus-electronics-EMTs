to be converted, then the MSB is reset to 0 and the next bit is tried as the MSB. On the other
hand, if the signal to be converted is larger than the D/A computer output, then the MSB remains
1. This procedure is repeated for each bit until the binary equivalent of the input analog signal
is obtained at the end. This method requires only n clock periods, compared to the 2n clock
periods needed by the counter-controlled A/D converter, where n is the number of bits required
to encode the analog signal. The National ADC 0844 is a popular 8-bit A/D converter based on
the SAR.
