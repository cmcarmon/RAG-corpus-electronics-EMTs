Molecular capsules are chemical scaffolds designed to capture and hold a guest molecule (see molecular encapsulation). Szumna and coworkers developed a novel molecular capsule with a chiral interior. This capsule is made of two halves, like a plastic easter egg (Figure 6). Salt bridge interactions between the two halves cause them to self-assemble in solution (Figure 7). They are stable even when heated to 60 Â°C.
