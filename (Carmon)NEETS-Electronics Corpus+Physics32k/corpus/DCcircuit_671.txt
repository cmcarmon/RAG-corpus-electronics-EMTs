This is how practical electrical meters are designed and used: a sensitive meter movement
is built to operate with as little voltage and current as possible for maximum sensitivity, then
it is ”fooled” by some sort of divider circuit built of precision resistors so that it indicates full-
scale when a much larger voltage or current is impressed on the circuit as a whole. We have
examined the design of a simple voltmeter here. Ammeters follow the same general rule, except
that parallel-connected ”shunt” resistors are used to create a current divider circuit as opposed
to the series-connected voltage divider ”multiplier” resistors used for voltmeter designs.
