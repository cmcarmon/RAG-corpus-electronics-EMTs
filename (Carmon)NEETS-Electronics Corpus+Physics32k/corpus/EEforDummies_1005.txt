The 74HC00 IC shown in Figure 14-9 is a CMOS quad 2‚Äêinput NAND gate. In 
the top circuit diagram, each NAND gate is labeled 1/4 74HC00 because it is 
one of four NAND gates in the IC. (This type of gate labeling is common in 
digital circuit schematics.) Note that the fourth NAND gate is not used in this
