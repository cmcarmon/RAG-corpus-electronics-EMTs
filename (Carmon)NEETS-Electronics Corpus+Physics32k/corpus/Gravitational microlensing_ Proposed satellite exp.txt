Galactic Exoplanet Survey Telescope (GEST)
SIM Microlensing Key Project would have used the extremely high precision astrometry of the Space Interferometry Mission satellite to break the microlensing degeneracy and measure the mass, distance, and velocity of lenses. This satellite was postponed several times and finally cancelled in 2010.
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope - Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets (WFIRST - AFTA) is to combine a microlensing survey with several other missions. The microlensing data will complement data from Kepler, with better sensitivity to planets like Earth that are not close in to their suns.
