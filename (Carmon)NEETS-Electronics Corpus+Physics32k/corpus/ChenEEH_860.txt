ters hRi, Rji. In these cases, the labeling of the corresponding
edge is straightforward. The permissible range bounds lk and uk
are computed as shown in (Friedman, 1995; Neves and Fried-
man, 1996a, 1996b; Afghani and Svensson, 1990; Kourtev,
1999), and the direction of the arrow is chosen so as to coincide
with the direction of the signal propagation from Ri to Rj. With
these choices, the clock skew is computed as s Â¼ t i
cd. In
Figure 4.4 for example, the direction labelings of both e1 and e2
can be chosen from v1 to v3 and from v2 to v3, respectively.
