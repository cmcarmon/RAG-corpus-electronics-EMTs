The spin axes of the black holes were likely misaligned with the axis of the binary orbit. The probability that both spin axes were positively aligned with the orbit is less than 5%. This configuration suggests that the binary black hole system was formed dynamically in a dense star cluster such as a globular cluster, i.e., as a result of gravitational interaction between stars and binary stars, in which case randomly aligned spin axes are expected. The competing scenario, that the system was formed out of a binary star system consisting of two normal (main sequence) stars, is not ruled out but is disfavored as black holes formed in such a binary are more likely to have positively aligned spins.
