Of the ﬁve traditional senses, vision and hearing best deﬁne the interactions that permit us to be human. These
two senses are the main input channels through which data with high information content can ﬂow. We read;
we  listen  to  speech  or  music;  we  view  art.  A  loss  of  one  or  the  other  of  these  senses  (or  both)  can  have  a
devastating impact on the individual affected. Rehabilitation engineers attempt to restore the functions of these
senses,  either  through  augmentation  or  via  sensory  substitution  systems.  Eyeglasses  and  hearing  aids  are
examples of augmentative devices that can be used if some residual capacity remains. A major area of rehabil-
itation engineering research deals with
