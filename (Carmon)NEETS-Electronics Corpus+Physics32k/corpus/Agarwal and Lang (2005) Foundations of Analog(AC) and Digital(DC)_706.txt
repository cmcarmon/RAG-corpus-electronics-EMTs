In our representation with the forbidden region, a sender can output any
voltage value between VH and 5 V for a logical 1, and any value between 0 V
and VL for a logical 0. A sender must never output a value in the forbidden
region. Correspondingly, as illustrated in Figure 5.5, a receiver must interpret
any voltage value between VH and 5 V as a logical 1, and any value between
0 V and VL as a logical 0. The behavior of the receiver can be undefined if it sees
a voltage value between VL and VH because these values are in the forbidden
region.
