In FEM, the region under simulation is divided into triangular and quadrilateral regions in two dimensions
or  into  tetrahedra  in  three  dimensions.  The  regions  are  placed  to  have  the  maximum  number  of  vertices  in
areas where there is expected to be a large variation of composition or a large variation in the solution. The
equations  in  FEM  are  modiÔ¨Åed  by  multiplying  them  with  some  shape  function  and  integrating  over  the
simulated  region.  In  triangular  meshes,  the  shape  function  is  dependent  on  the  area  of  the  triangle  and  the
spatial location of the node. The value of the spatial function is between 0 and 1. The solution at one node is
the sum of all the solutions, resulting from the nearby nodes, multiplied by their respective shape functions.
The number of nodes required to simulate a region is less than that in FDM; however, the memory requirement
is greater.
