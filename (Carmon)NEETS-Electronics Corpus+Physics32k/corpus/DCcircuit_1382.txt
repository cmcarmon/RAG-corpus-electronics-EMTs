It must be understood that this formula yields approximate ﬁgures only. One reason for
this is the fact that permeability changes as the ﬁeld intensity varies (remember the nonlinear
”B/H” curves for different materials). Obviously, if permeability (µ) in the equation is unstable,
then the inductance (L) will also be unstable to some degree as the current through the coil
changes in magnitude. If the hysteresis of the core material is signiﬁcant, this will also have
strange effects on the inductance of the coil. Inductor designers try to minimize these effects
by designing the core in such a way that its ﬂux density never approaches saturation levels,
and so the inductor operates in a more linear portion of the B/H curve.
