Voltage dividers were discussed in Section 17–4 
and will not be discussed extensively in this section. A 
voltage divider can be used to convert a higher voltage 
to a lower voltage for application requiring less voltage. 
Ohm’s law (presented in Chapter 14) is one of the most 
important concepts to understand. It states that the 
current through a circuit is directly proportional to the 
voltage across the circuit and inversely proportional to 
the resistance.
