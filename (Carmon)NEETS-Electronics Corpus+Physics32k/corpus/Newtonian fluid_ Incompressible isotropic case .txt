For an incompressible and isotropic Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress is related to the strain rate by the simpler equation




τ
=
μ



d
u


d
y





{\displaystyle \tau =\mu {\frac {du}{dy}}}

where




τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the shear stress ("drag") in the fluid,




μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is a scalar constant of proportionality, the shear viscosity of the fluid







d
u


d
y





{\displaystyle {\frac {du}{dy}}}
is the derivative of the velocity component that is parallel to the direction of shear, relative to displacement in the perpendicular direction.
If the fluid is incompressible and viscosity is constant across the fluid, this equation can be written in terms of an arbitrary coordinate system as

{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)}

where
