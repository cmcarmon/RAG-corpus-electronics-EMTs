7. The rise and fall times are sometimes defined slightly differently. For example, the rise time of a
node that transitions from a low to a high voltage might be defined as the time taken by a signal
at that node to rise from 5% to 95% of the change in voltage. Alternatively, the rise time can be
defined as the time taken by a signal at that node to rise from a valid low voltage VOL to a valid
high voltage VOH. As one more possibility, the rise time might be defined as the time taken by
a signal to rise from its lowest value to 50% of the voltage difference. Corresponding definitions
for the fall time also exist. The vagueness of these definitions only serves the interests of product
marketeers, but for us, the important thing to learn is how to calculate the time intervals between
any pair of signal values.
