Practical Op Amps
A  nonideal  op  amp  is  characterized  not  only  by  ﬁnite  open-loop  gain,  input  and  output  resistance,  ﬁnite
currents, and frequency bandwidths, but also by various nonidealities due to the construction of the op amp
circuit or external connections. A complete model for a practical op amp is illustrated in Fig. 27.3. The nonideal
