The DFi
CQM are the maximum clock-to-output delay
propagation times of the ﬂip-ﬂop and latch i, respectively; Di; f
PM
is the maximum logic propagation delay from Ri to Rf , dFf
S and
dLf
S are the setup times of the ﬂip-ﬂop and latch f, respectively;
and DL and DT are the maximum deviations of the leading and
trailing edges of the clock signal, respectively. Similarly, the short
delay ^DDi; f
