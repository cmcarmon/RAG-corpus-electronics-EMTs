With radiation equilibrium temperatures of 40â€“50 K, the objects in the Kuiper Belt are expected have amorphous water ice. While water ice has been observed on several objects, the extreme faintness of these objects makes it difficult to determine the structure of the ices. Interestingly, the signatures of crystalline water ice was observed on 50000 Quaoar, perhaps due to resurfacing events such as impacts or cryovolcanism.
