*15.2.22 Consider the signals given by Equations (15.2.12)
through (15.2.14). Let them be normalized such
that the red, green, and blue signals have a maxi-
mum amplitude of unity. If mI(t) and mQ(t) are the
real and imaginary components of a color vector,
deﬁned by a magnitude [m2
Q(t )]1/2 and
−1 [−mQ(t )/ml (t )], sketch points cor-
phase tan
responding to fully saturated R, G, and B colors.
15.2.23 If a television station operates on UHF channel
20 (band 506–512 MHz), determine the station’s
visual-carrier frequency.
