Spectral Subtraction
The spectral subtraction approach [Weiss, 1974] is the simplest and most intuitive and popular speech enhance-
ment approach. This approach provides estimates of the clean signal as well as of the short time spectrum of
that signal. Estimation is performed on a frame-by-frame basis, where each frame consists of 20–40 msec of
speech samples. In the spectral subtraction approach the signal is Fourier transformed, and spectral components
whose variance is smaller than that of the noise are nulled. The surviving spectral components are modiﬁed
by  an  appropriately  chosen  gain  function.  The  resulting  set  of  nulled  and  modiﬁed  spectral  components
constitute the spectral components of the enhanced signal. The signal estimate is obtained from inverse Fourier
transform of the enhanced spectral components. The short time spectrum estimate of the signal is obtained
from  squaring  the  enhanced  spectral  components.  A  block  diagram  of  the  spectral  subtraction  approach  is
shown in Fig. 15.4.
