However, because the waves travel along the wire at the speed of light, the simple twt shown in 
figure 2-14 will not work. At present no way is known to accelerate an electron beam to the speed of 
light. Since the electron beam cannot travel faster than the wave on the wire, bunching will not take place 
and the tube will not work. The twt is therefore designed with a delay structure to slow the traveling wave 
down to or below the speed of the electrons in the beam. A common twt delay structure is a wire, wound 
in the form of a long coil or helix, as shown in figure 2-15, view (A). The shape of the helix slows the 
effective velocity of the wave along the common axis of the helix and the tube to about one-tenth the 
speed of light. The wave still travels down the helix wire at the speed of light, but the coiled shape causes 
the wave to travel a much greater total distance than the electron beam. The speed at which the wave 
travels down the tube can be varied by changing the number of turns or the diameter of the turns in the 
helix wire. The helical delay structure works well because it has the added advantage of causing a large 
proportion of electric fields that are parallel to the electron beam. The parallel fields provide maximum 
interaction between the fields and the electron beam.
