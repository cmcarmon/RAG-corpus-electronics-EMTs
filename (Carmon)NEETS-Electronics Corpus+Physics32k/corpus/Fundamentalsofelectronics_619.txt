The resulting discrete-time signal, shown in the bottom of Figure 5.14, clearly changes its character with
time. To display these spectral changes, the long signal was sectioned into frames: comparatively short,
contiguous groups of samples. Conceptually, a Fourier transform of each frame is calculated using the FFT.
Each frame is not so long that signiﬁcant signal variations are retained within a frame, but not so short
that we lose the signal’s spectral character. Roughly speaking, the speech signal’s spectrum is evaluated
over successive time segments and stacked side by side so that the x-axis corresponds to time and the y-axis
frequency, with color indicating the spectral amplitude.
