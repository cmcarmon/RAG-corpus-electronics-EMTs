Figure 113.4 illustrates an electrical model for myelinated nerve as originally formulated by McNeal [1976].
The  myelin  internodes  are  treated  as  perfect  insulators  and  the  nodes  as  individual  circuits  consisting  of
 and an ionic conductance term. The nodes are interconnected through the internal axon medium
capacitance 
  at  the
by  conductances 
exterior of the nodes.
