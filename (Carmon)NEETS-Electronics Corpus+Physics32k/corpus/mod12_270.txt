PERCENT OF MODULATION.â€”Before we explain 100-percent modulation in an fm system,
let's review the conditions for 100-percent modulation of an AM wave. Recall that 100-percent
modulation for AM exists when the amplitude of the modulation envelope varies between 0 volts and
twice its normal unmodulated value. At 100-percent modulation there is a power increase of 50 percent.
Because the modulating wave is not constant in voice signals, the degree of modulation constantly varies.
In this case the vacuum tubes in an AM system cannot be operated at maximum efficiency because of
varying power requirements.
