A physical distance can mean several different things:
The length of a specific path traveled between two points, such as the distance walked while navigating a maze

The length of the shortest possible path through space between two point that could be taken if there were no obstacles (usually formalized as Euclidean distance)
The length of the shortest path between two points while remaining on some surface, such as the great-circle distance along the curve of the Earth
"Circular distance" is the distance traveled by a wheel, which can be useful when designing vehicles or mechanical gears. The circumference of the wheel is 2π × radius, and assuming the radius to be 1, then each revolution of the wheel is equivalent of the distance 2π radians. In engineering ω = 2πƒ is often used, where ƒ is the frequency.
Unusual definitions of distance can be helpful to model certain physical situations, but are also used in theoretical mathematics:
"Manhattan distance" is a rectilinear distance, named after the number of blocks north, south, east, or west a taxicab must travel on to reach its destination on the grid of streets in parts of New York City.
"Chessboard distance", formalized as Chebyshev distance, is the minimum number of moves a king must make on a chessboard to travel between two squares.
Distance measures in cosmology are complicated by the expansion of the universe, and by effects described by the theory of relativity such as length contraction of moving objects.
