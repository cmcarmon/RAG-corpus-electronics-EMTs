For magnetic materials there exists the special case where the real refractive indices of the two media are equal, n1 = n2, but the magnetic permeabilities are unequal. In this case the reflected ray is independent of the incident polarization and of the angle of incidence, and the magnitude of the reflection is constant except at grazing incidence.
