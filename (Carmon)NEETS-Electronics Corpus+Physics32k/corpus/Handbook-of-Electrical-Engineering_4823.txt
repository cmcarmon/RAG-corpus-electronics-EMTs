Figure 50.2  illustrates  the  quadratic  dependence  of  the  transverse  strain  on  the  induced  polarization  for
ceramic 0.9PMN–0.1PT. Figure 50.3a and b show the longitudinal strain as a function of the applied electric
ﬁeld for the same composition. The strain-ﬁeld plots are not quadratic, and illustrate essentially anhysteretic
nature of electrostrictive strain. The transverse strain is negative, as expected.
