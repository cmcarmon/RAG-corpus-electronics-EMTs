 POWER LOSSES IN AN INDUCTORâ€”Since an inductor (coil) contains a number turns of wire, 
and all wire has some resistance, the inductor has a certain amount of resistance. This resistance is usually 
very small and has a negligible effect on current. However, there are power losses in an inductor. The 
main power losses in an inductor are copper loss, hysteresis loss, and eddy-current loss. Copper loss can 
be calculated by multiplying the square of the current by the resistance of the wire in the coil (I2R). 
Hysteresis loss is due to power that is consumed in reversing the magnetic field of the core each time the 
current direction changes. Eddy-current loss is due to core heating caused by circulating currents induced 
in an iron core by the magnetic field of the coil.
