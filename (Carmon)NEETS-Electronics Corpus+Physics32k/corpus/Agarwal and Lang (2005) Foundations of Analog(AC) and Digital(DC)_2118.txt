The model in Figure 15.6 represents Equation 15.3 in circuit terms. To
clearly distinguish the dependent source from an independent source, as before,
all dependent sources are represented by diamond-shaped symbols. The disem-
bodied wires on the left of the diagram are distressing at first sight, but merely
indicate that the input current to this ideal voltage-controlled voltage source is
zero by definition; that is, i
