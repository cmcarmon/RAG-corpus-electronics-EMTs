Microstrip  and  waveguide  realizations  of  directional  couplers  are  shown  in  Figs. 39.8(b)  and  (c)  where  the
microstrip  coupler  couples  in  the  backward  direction  and  the  waveguide  coupler  couples  in  the  forward
direction. The powers at the output ports of the hybrids shown in Fig. 39.9 are equal and so the hybrids serve
to split a signal into half as well as having directional sensitivity.
