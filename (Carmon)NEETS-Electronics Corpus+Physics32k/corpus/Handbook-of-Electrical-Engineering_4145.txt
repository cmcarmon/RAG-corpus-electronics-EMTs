An understanding of lightning and of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced by lightning is critical to an
understanding of lightning-induced effects on electronic and electric power systems. This section begins with
an  overview  of  the  terminology  and  physics  of  lightning.  Then,  statistics  on  lightning  occurrence  are  given.
Next the characteristics of the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds resulting from lightning charges and currents
are examined, and the models used to describe that relationship are discussed. The section ends with a discussion
of the coupling of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from lightning to overhead wires.
