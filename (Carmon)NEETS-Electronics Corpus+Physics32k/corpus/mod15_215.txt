Troubles in new and modified synchro systems are most often because of (1) improper wiring and 
(2) misalignment caused by synchros not being zeroed. You are responsible for finding and correcting 
these troubles. You can check for improper wiring with an ohmmeter by making a point-to-point 
continuity and resistance check. You can correct misalignment of a synchro system by rezeroing the 
entire system.
