Scan/Set  Logic.
Scan/set  [Stewart,  1977]  is  another  form  of  implementing  scan  technology  whereby  the
sequential circuit structure is separated from its accompanying scan/set register. This is illustrated in Fig. 85.15.
A variation on this scheme is the so-called shadow-register concept that has been implemented in some off-
the-shelf IC components [AMDI, 1987].
