The speech signal, such as shown in Figure 5.14, is sectioned into overlapping, equal-length frames, with
a Hanning window applied to each frame. The spectra of each of these is calculated, and displayed in
spectrograms with frequency extending vertically, window time location running horizontally, and spectral
magnitude color-coded. Figure 5.17 illustrates these computations.
