After the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, geolophysicist Harry Fielding Reid examined the displacement of the ground surface along the San Andreas Fault. He concluded that the quake must have been the result of the elastic rebound of the strain energy in the rocks on either side of the fault. Later measurements using the global positioning system largely support Reidâ€™s theory as the basis of seismic movement.
