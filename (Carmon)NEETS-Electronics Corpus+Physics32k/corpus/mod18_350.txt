BLOCKING refers to a condition of the receiver in which the voltage pulse at the receiver input is
too large. As a result, for a short time after the pulse, the receiver is insensitive or blocked to signals
below a certain level. This condition results from one or more of the amplifier stages in the receiver being
overdriven. After a strong pulse, the receiver may be biased to a point at which it will not amplify small
signals. Recovery after blocking may be only a fraction of a microsecond, or it may take several hundred
microseconds, depending upon the point in the receiver at which blocking occurs. To detect a weak echo
immediately following a strong one, the receiver must have a short BLOCKING RECOVERY TIME.
The blocking itself must be minimized as much as possible. If a portion of the transmitted pulse leaks into
the receiver input, then the receiver may be blocked and not show small, nearby objects. In most
receivers, blocking is minimized from this cause by a duplexer. The duplexer protects the receiver by
isolating it during the transmitted pulse.
