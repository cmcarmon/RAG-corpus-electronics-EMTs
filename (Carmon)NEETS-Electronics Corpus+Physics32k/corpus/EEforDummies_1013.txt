Now that you’re familiar with the ABCs of schematics, it’s time to put it all 
together and walk through each part of a simple schematic. The schematic 
shown in Figure 14-14 shows the LED flasher circuit used in Chapter 17. This 
circuit controls the on/off blinking of an LED, with the blinking rate con-
trolled by turning the knob of a potentiometer (variable resistor).
