The loss of an electron from the N-type material created a positive ion in the N material, while the
loss of a hole from the P material created a negative ion in that material. These ions are fixed in place in
the crystal lattice structure and cannot move. Thus, they make up a layer of fixed charges on the two sides
of the junction as shown in figure 1-17. On the N side of the junction, there is a layer of positively
charged ions; on the P side of the junction, there is a layer of negatively charged ions. An electrostatic
field, represented by a small battery in the figure, is established across the junction between the oppositely
