The shear rate for a fluid flowing between two parallel plates, one moving at a constant speed and the other one stationary (Couette flow), is defined by







γ
˙



=


v
h


,


{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}={\frac {v}{h}},}

where:
.γ is the shear rate, measured in reciprocal seconds;
v is the velocity of the moving plate, measured in meters per second;
h is the distance between the two parallel plates, measured in meters.

{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}_{ij}={\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}.}

For the simple shear case, it is just a gradient of velocity in a flowing material. The SI unit of measurement for shear rate is s−1, expressed as "reciprocal seconds" or "inverse seconds".
The shear rate at the inner wall of a Newtonian fluid flowing within a pipe is

d


,


{\displaystyle {\dot {\gamma }}={\frac {8v}{d}},}

where:
.γ is the shear rate, measured in reciprocal seconds;
v is the linear fluid velocity;
d is the inside diameter of the pipe.
The linear fluid velocity v is related to the volumetric flow rate Q by




v

,


{\displaystyle v={\frac {Q}{A}},}

where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe, which for an inside pipe radius of r is given by

{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2},}

{\displaystyle v={\frac {Q}{\pi r^{2}}}.}

Substituting the above into the earlier equation for the shear rate of a Newtonian fluid flowing within a pipe, and noting (in the denominator) that d = 2r:

which simplifies to the following equivalent form for wall shear rate in terms of volumetric flow rate Q and inner pipe radius r:

For a Newtonian fluid wall, shear stress (τw) can be related to shear rate by τw = .γxμ, where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. For non-Newtonian fluids, there are different constitutive laws depending on the fluid, which relates the stress tensor to the shear rate tensor.
