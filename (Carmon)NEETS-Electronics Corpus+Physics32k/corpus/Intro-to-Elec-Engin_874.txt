10.3.12 A three-phase, 60-Hz transmission line has a total
series impedance of 22.86(cid:2) 62.3Â°  per phase. It
delivers 2.5 MW at 13.8 kV to a load connected
to its receiving end. Compute the sending-end
voltage, current, real power, and reactive power
for the following conditions:
(a) 0.8 power factor lagging.
(b) Unity power factor.
(c) 0.9 power factor leading.
