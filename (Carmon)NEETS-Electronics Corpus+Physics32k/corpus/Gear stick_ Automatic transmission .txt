Automatic transmissions traditionally have had a straight pattern, adopting the classic P-R-N-D gate, with "P" being to the front, topmost position (or "P" all the way to the left on a column mounted shifter); the corresponding shift positions being:
P = Park - transmission is mechanically locked in position for parking. R = Reverse - reverse motion N = Neutral - no drive applied to the wheels with the engine running D = Drive - forward motion with full automatic operation in all gears.
All automatics use some sort of manual override of the transmission, with numbered positions in descending order marked below (or to the right) of "Drive", which will prevent the transmission shifting to a gear higher than the selected, but maintaining automatic operation between all lesser numbered gears. Such gates will appear as "P-R-N-D-3-2-1" for example. On some vehicles (mainly Japanese makes such as Honda, Toyota and Lexus being good examples) these numbered positions are replaced by a single "L" (for "Low") position, which will hold the transmission in whatever lower ratio is required for climbing steep grades or for heavy acceleration.
More modern automatic transmissions have employed a "J-gate" (pioneered by Jaguar) where some gears are on the left-hand "arm", some on the right, and there is a sideways movement at the rear of the pattern. The second generation Range Rover from 1995 used an "H-gate", with two parallel PRND gates on the opposing legs of the "H" for both high range and low range ratios, for normal and off-road driving, respectively.
Some modern gearboxes such as the Alfa Romeo Sportronic have a traditional automatic shift pattern to the right, with a special position to the left in which movement of the stick forwards and backwards increments the gears up and down respectively. This can be useful in snow or dirt conditions, where it may be necessary to start from second gear.
