Silicon Detectors for Spatial Resolution
The uninterrupted progress of the semiconductor silicon industry in achieving both larger wafers and smaller
device  features  has  allowed  the  development  of  larger  and  more  complex  silicon  detectors  that  can  provide
position information in addition to (or instead of) energy information. Spatial detection can be obtained by
fabricating detectors as pixels (two-dimensional) or strips (one-dimensional) on the same wafer. For penetrating
radiation,  two  strip  detectors,  one  behind  the  other  but  with  the  strip  pattern  rotated  90Â°,  provide  two-
dimensional positioning. Frequently, such detectors are individually designed and fabricated for a particular
application. Strip detectors and CCD (charge-coupled device) detectors will be discussed here.
