The impedance mismatches associated with the use of reﬂective ﬁlters can result in an increase of interference.
In such cases, the use of dissipative elements is found to be useful. A broad range of ferrite components are
available in the form of beads, tubes, connector shells, and pins. A very effective method of low-pass ﬁltering
is  to  form  the  ferrite  into  a  coaxial  geometry,  the  properties  of  which  are  proportional  to  the  length  of  the
ferrite, as shown in Fig. 40.11.
