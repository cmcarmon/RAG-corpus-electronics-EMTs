Figure 2-28 is the schematic diagram of a buffer amplifier. This circuit is a common-collector 
amplifier. A common-collector amplifier has a high input impedance and a low output impedance. Since 
the output of an oscillator is connected to the high impedance of the common-collector amplifier, the 
buffer has little effect on the operation of the oscillator. The output of the common-collector buffer is then 
connected to an external load; therefore, the changes in the output load cannot reflect back to the 
oscillator circuit. Thus, the buffer amplifier reduces interaction between the load and the oscillator. Figure 
2-29 illustrates a shunt-fed Hartley oscillator with a buffer amplifier. This is "one-way" coupling since the 
oscillator signal is coupled forward, but load changes are not coupled back to the oscillator.
