all this concern. The fundamental electrical quantities of a circuit are voltage and current and are
dependent on the circuit characteristics of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. In addition to these
three individual characteristics, don’t forget that many electronic components exhibit more than one
circuit characteristic at the same time. An example would be a piece of coaxial cable that is engineered by
its manufacturer to meet characteristic specifications for impedance, capacitance, and inductance. But let’s
keep it simple and begin by covering voltage measurements.
