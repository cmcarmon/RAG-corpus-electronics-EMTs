Cleanliness must be emphasized in the removal and replacement of covers on semi sealed relays.
The entry of dust or other foreign material can cause poor contact connection. When the relay is installed
in a position where there is a possibility of contact with explosive fumes, extra care should be taken with
the cover gasket. Any damage to, or incorrect seating of the gasket increases the possibility of igniting the
vapors.
