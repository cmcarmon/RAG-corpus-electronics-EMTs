Particles, for example, in a magnetic recording do not all reverse their magnetization at the same ﬁeld; there
is  a  distribution  of  switching  ﬁelds,  which  can  be  found  by  differentiating M  with  respect  to  H  around  the
point Hc. The result is shown as the broken curve on Fig. 36.8, where the SFD = DH/Hc, DH being the width
at half the maximum of the curve. Typically, SFD = 0.2–0.3 for a high-quality particulate medium and smaller
than this for thin-ﬁlm recording media.
