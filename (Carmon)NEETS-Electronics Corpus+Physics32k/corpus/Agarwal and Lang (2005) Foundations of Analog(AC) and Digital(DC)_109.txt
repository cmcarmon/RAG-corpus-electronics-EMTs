The third postulate of the lumped matter discipline requires us to limit
ourselves to signal speeds that are significantly lower than the speed of elec-
tromagnetic waves. As technology advances, propagation effects are becoming
harder to ignore. In particular, as computer speeds pass the gigahertz range,
increasing signal speeds and fixed system dimensions tend to break our abstrac-
tions, so that engineers working on the forefront of technology must constantly
revisit the disciplines upon which abstractions are based and prepare to resort
to fundamental physics if the constraints are violated.
