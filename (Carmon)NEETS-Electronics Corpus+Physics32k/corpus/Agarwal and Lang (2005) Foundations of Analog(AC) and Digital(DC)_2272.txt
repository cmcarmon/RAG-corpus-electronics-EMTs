that vIN(t) = 1 V sin(2π100 rad/s t), determine and graph vOUT for 0 ≤ t ≤ 20 ms.
e x e r c i s e 16.4 Determine and graph vOUT as a function of vIN for the circuit
shown in Figure 16.31. In doing so, model the diode as shown in Figure 16.29, and
assume that the Op Amp is ideal. Also, contrast the input-output behavior of the circuit
shown in Figure 16.31 with that of the half-wave rectifier studied in the chapter on
nonlinear analysis.

This exercise explores the use of superposition to analyze net-
works containing diodes. For this purpose, assume that the diodes in Figure 16.32 are
all ideal.
