A flowing afterglow is an ion source that is used to create ions in a flow of inert gas, typically helium or argon. Flowing afterglow ion sources usually consist of a dielectric discharge that gases are channeled through to be excited and thus made into plasma. Flowing afterglow ion sources can be coupled with a selected-ion flow-tube for selection of reactant ions. When this ion source is coupled with mass spectrometry it is referred to as flowing afterglow mass spectrometry.
Flowing-afterglow mass spectrometry uses a flowing afterglow to create protonated water cluster ions in a helium or argon carrier gas in a flow tube that react with sample molecules that are measured by a mass spectrometer downstream. These systems can be used for trace gas analysis. This works by keeping the initial ionization source spatially separated from the target analyte and channeling the afterglow of the initial ionization towards the analyte. Analytes are added downstream to create ion products. Ions Detection of ions is usually accomplished using a mass spectrometer or by optical spectroscopy.
