Instruction Set Extensions
Both heterogeneous multiprocessors and VSPs are specialized architectures for video. However, there are many
applications in which it is desirable to execute video programs directly on a workstation or PC: programs that
are  closely  tied  to  the  operating  system,  mixed  video/graphics  applications,  etc.  Traditional  microprocessors
are fast but are not especially well-utilized by video programs. For these applications, microprocessor instruction
set  extensions  have  been  developed  to  allow  video  algorithms  to  be  executed  more  efÔ¨Åciently  on  traditional
microprocessors.
