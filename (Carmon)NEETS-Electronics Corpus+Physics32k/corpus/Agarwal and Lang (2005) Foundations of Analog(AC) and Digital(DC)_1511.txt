The waveforms shown in Figure 10.50 will apply to the memory element
circuit shown in Figure 10.52 under the following idealized assumptions: When
the store signal is high, the RC time constant associated with the capacitor
circuit is negligible, and when the store signal is low, the RC time constant
associated with the capacitor circuit is infinite. The RC time constant of the
circuit when the store signal is high is given by the product of CM and the sum
of the on resistances of the switch and the driving element. Similarly, the RC
time constant of the circuit when the store signal is low is given by the product
of CM and the resistance seen by the capacitor.15
