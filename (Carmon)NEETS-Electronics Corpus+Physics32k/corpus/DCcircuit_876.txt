This second junction is called the reference or cold junction, to distinguish it from the junc-
tion at the measuring end, and there is no way to avoid having one in a thermocouple circuit.
In some applications, a differential temperature measurement between two points is required,
and this inherent property of thermocouples can be exploited to make a very simple measure-
ment system.
