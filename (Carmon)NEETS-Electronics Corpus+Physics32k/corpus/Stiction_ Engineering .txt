Stiction refers to the characteristic of stop and start type motion as a force overcomes static friction and causes a part to accelerate under dynamic friction, but the force cannot keep up with the speed of the moving part so the part tends to stop again until the force catches up, and it happens repeatedly. Stiction is a problem for the design and materials science of many moving linkages. This is particularly the case for linear sliding joints, rather than rotating pivots. Owing to simple geometry, the moving distance of a sliding joint in two comparable linkages is longer than the circumferential travel of a pivoting bearing, thus the forces involved (for equivalent work) are lower and stiction forces become proportionally more significant. This issue has often led to linkages being redesigned from sliding to purely pivoted structures, just to avoid problems with stiction. An example is the Chapman strut, a suspension linkage developed by Colin Chapman of Lotus cars.
