A section of a complete circular paraboloid, often called an ORANGE-PEEL REFLECTOR because 
of its orange-peel shape, is shown in figure 3-6. Since the reflector is narrow in the horizontal plane and 
wide in the vertical plane, it produces a beam that is wide in the horizontal plane and narrow in the 
vertical plane. In shape, the beam resembles a huge beaver tail. The microwave energy is sent into the 
parabolic reflector by a horn radiator (not shown) which is fed by a waveguide. The horn radiation pattern 
covers nearly the entire shape of the reflector, so almost all of the microwave energy strikes the reflector 
and very little escapes at the sides. Antenna systems which use orange-peel paraboloids are often used in 
height-finding equipment.
