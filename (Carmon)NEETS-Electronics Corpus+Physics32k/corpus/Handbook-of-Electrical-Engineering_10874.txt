Take, as a simple example, single-input single-output control systems design. For each element in the system
model, i.e., plant, controller, feedback network, the user has to look after four matrices for a state-space model
”, but must refer
or two polynomials for a transfer function. He cannot simply refer to the “transfer function 
instead to the numerator and the denominator polynomials (see Fig. 112.7) that stand for 
. These polynomials
can, in turn, only be distinguished from row vectors by convention and context.
