If you were a fan of the Knight Rider television series that aired in the â€™80s, 
you remember the sequential light chaser that the KITT Car sported in front. 
In this section, I show you two versions of the light chaser, each of which 
uses just two inexpensive ICs and a handful of other parts. You may want to 
choose one circuit or the other to build. Light Chaser 1 is a little easier to 
understand. Light Chaser 2 adds a layer of complexity to increase the cool 
factor.
