factor is the amount of space between the plates. The closer the plates, the greater will be the electrostatic
field. A greater electrostatic field causes a greater capacitance. The plate spacing is determined by the
thickness of the dielectric. The third factor affecting capacitance is the dielectric constant. The value of the
dielectric constant is dependent upon the type of dielectric used.
