Direct-coupled, or Dc, amplifiers are used for high 
gain at low frequencies or for amplification of a direct-
current signal. The DC amplifier is also used to eliminate 
frequency loss through a coupling network. Applica-
tions of the DC amplifier include computers, measuring 
and test instruments, and industrial control equipment.
A simple DC amplifier is shown in Figure 38-1. The 
common-emitter amplifier is the one most frequently 
used. The circuit is shown with voltage-divider bias and 
emitter feedback. This type of circuit does not use a cou-
pling capacitor. The input is applied directly to the base 
of the transistor. The output is taken from the collector.
The DC amplifier can provide both voltage and 
current gain. However, it is used primarily as a voltage 
amplifier. The voltage gain is uniform for both AC and 
DC signals.
