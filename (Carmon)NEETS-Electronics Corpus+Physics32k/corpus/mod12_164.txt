The bandwidth of a modulated wave is a function of the frequencies contained in the modulating 
signal. For example, when a 100-kilohertz carrier is modulated by a 5-kilohertz audio tone, sideband 
frequencies are created at 95 and 105 kilohertz. This signal requires 10 kilohertz of space in the spectrum.
