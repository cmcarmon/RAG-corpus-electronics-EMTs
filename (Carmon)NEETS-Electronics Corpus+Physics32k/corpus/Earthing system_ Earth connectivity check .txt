A separate pilot core p is run from distribution/ equipment supply system in addition to earth core. Earth connectivity check device is fixed at the sourcing end which continuously monitor earth connectivity. The pilot core p initiate from this check device and runs through connecting trailing cable which generally supply power to moving mining machinery(LHD). This core p is connected to earth at the distribution end through a diode circuit, which complete the electric circuit initiated from the check device.When earth connectivity to vehicle is broken, this pilot core circuit get disconnected, the protecting device fixed at sourcing end activate and, isolate the power to machine. This type of circuit is a must for portable heavy electric equipment (like LHD (Load, Haul, Dump machine)) being used in under ground mines.
