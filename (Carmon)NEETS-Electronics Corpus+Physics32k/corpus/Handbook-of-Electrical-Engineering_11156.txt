The packaging of the pressure transducer also represents a problem that needs to be addressed. Packaging
must  both  protect  the  transducer  and  be  biocompatible.  It  also  must  allow  the  appropriate  pressure  to  be
transmitted from the biologic ï¬‚uid to the diaphragm. The amount of packaging material required should be
kept at a minimum so as not to substantially increase the size of implantable or indwelling sensors. Furthermore,
the material must be mechanically stable so that it does not swell or contract, since this will most likely change
the  baseline  pressure  seen  by  the  sensor.  These  problems  need  to  be  overcome  before  miniature  pressure
transducers can be used reliably in implantable applications.
