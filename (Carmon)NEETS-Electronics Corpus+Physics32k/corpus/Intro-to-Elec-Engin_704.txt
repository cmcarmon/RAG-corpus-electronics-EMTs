*7.3.7 Using the small-signal equivalent circuit of a BJT
with gm = 0.03 S, Î² = 75, and VA = 65 V, a load
resistor RL is connected from the collector to the
emitter, as shown in Figure P7.3.7. The transistor
is biased to have a dc collector current of 6 mA.
(a) Calculate vL due to the small change vBE.
(b) Find the corresponding change iB in the
