The ﬁrst
term in the right-hand side of equation 6.16
represents the force from the electric ﬁeld. The second term
in the right-hand side of the same equation represents the loss
of the electron momentum, mnvn, due to electron collisions
with impurities and/or lattice vibrations; tnp is called the
momentum relaxation time. From equation 6.16, in a steady
state:
