In Fig. 112.14, we see a Symbol Editor session, with the edited Switch symbol in the lower left window. The
drawing  primitives  with  its  graphical  shapes  is  the  one  in  the  middle.  The  large  window  to  the  right  is  an
example of a block attributes window. In this case, it is the connectivity deﬁnition attributes for the left edge
of the switch block; these attributes are used to deﬁne the sides and vertices which allow inputs or outputs, the
allowed number of connections, vector dimension, and types.
