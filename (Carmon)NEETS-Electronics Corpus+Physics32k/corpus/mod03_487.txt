Switches are also classified by the number of positions of the actuating device. Figure 3-11 shows
three toggle switches, the toggle positions, and schematic diagrams of the switch. Figure 3-11(A) is a
single-pole, single-throw, two-position switch. The switch is marked to indicate the ON position (when
the switch is closed) and the OFF position (when the switch is open). Figure 3-11(B) is a single-pole,
double-throw, three-position switch. The switch markings show two ON positions and an OFF position.
When this switch is OFF, no connection is made between any of the terminals. In either of the ON
positions, the center terminal is connected to one of the outside terminals. (The outside terminals are not
connected together in any position of the switch.) Figure 3-11(C) is a single-pole, double-throw,
two-position switch. There is no OFF position. In either position of this switch, the center terminal is
connected to one of the outside terminals.
