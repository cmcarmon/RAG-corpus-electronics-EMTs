A DC (direct current) generator also converts 
 mechanical energy into electrical energy. It functions 
like an AC generator with the exception that it converts 
the AC voltage to DC voltage. It does this with a  device 
called a commutator, as shown in Figure 18-15. 
The output is taken from the commutator, a split 
ring. When the loop is rotated from position A to 
 position B, a voltage is induced. The induced voltage 
is  greatest as the motion is at right angles to the mag-
netic field. As the loop is rotated to position C, the in-
duced voltage decreases from the maximum value to 
zero. As the loop continues to rotate to position D, a 
 voltage is induced, but the commutator reverses the 
output  polarity so that it remains the same as before.
