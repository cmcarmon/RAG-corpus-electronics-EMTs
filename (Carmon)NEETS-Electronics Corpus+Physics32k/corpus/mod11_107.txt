Only a small degree of bunching takes place within the electron beam during the interval of travel 
from the input cavity to the middle cavity. The amount of bunching is sufficient, however, to cause 
oscillations within the middle cavity and to maintain a large oscillating voltage across the input gap. Most 
of the velocity modulation produced in the three-cavity klystron is caused by the voltage across the input 
gap of the middle cavity. The high voltage across the gap causes the bunching process to proceed rapidly 
in the drift space between the middle cavity and the output cavity. The electron bunches cross the gap of 
the output cavity when the gap voltage is at maximum negative. Maximum energy transfer from the 
electron beam to the output cavity occurs under these conditions. The energy given up by the electrons is 
the kinetic energy that was originally absorbed from the cathode pulse.
