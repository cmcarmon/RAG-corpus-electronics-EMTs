Beyond the IF stage, the two receivers have a marked difference. AM demodulation involves the
detection of variations in the amplitude of the signal; fm demodulation is the process of detecting
variations in the frequency of the signal. In fm receivers a DISCRIMINATOR is a circuit designed to
respond to frequency shift variations. A discriminator is preceded by a LIMITER circuit, which limits all
signals to the same amplitude level to minimize noise interference. The audio frequency component is
then extracted by the discriminator, amplified in the af amplifier, and used to drive the speaker.
