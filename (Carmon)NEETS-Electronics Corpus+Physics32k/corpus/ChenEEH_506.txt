Most compound semiconductors have the zinc blende crys-
tal structure seen in Figure 6.5 that is very similar to the
diamond structure. This structure contains two kinds of
atoms, A and B, with each species forming a face-centered
cubic lattice. These mutually penetrating face-centered cubic
(fcc) lattices of element A and element B are shifted relative to
each other by a quarter of the body diagonal of the unit cell
cube.
