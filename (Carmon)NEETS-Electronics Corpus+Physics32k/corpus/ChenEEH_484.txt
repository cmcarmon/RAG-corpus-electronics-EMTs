This chapter contains a brief overview and discussion of the
typical behavior of some of the most important characteristics
of a bipolar transistor. Due to the lack of space, the overview is
by no means complete, and the reader is referred to the
literature in the Reference list at the end of the chapter. To
facilitate in practice an easier understanding for circuit design-
ers and a meaningful comparison of processes, it is recom-
mended to choose the collector current density JC ¼ IC=AE
and the voltage VCE as independent variables for deﬁning the
bias points of a ﬁgure of merit (FoM).
