Microwave range finders also operate in vertical mode at GHz frequencies and is not as affected by fog and water spray as the laser altimeter. A continuous wave frequency modulated (CWFM) or pulsed radar waveform is normally used to provide range resolution. The beam is dispersive, hence the size of the footprint increases linearly with range.
One example of a microwave range finder is the Miros SM-094 which is designed for wave and water level (and tide) measurements. This sensor is applied as air gap (bridge clearance) sensor in NOAAs PORTS system. Another example is the WaveRadar REX which is a derivative of a Rosemount tank radar.

An array of three vertical radars in a triangular configuration can be used to measure a directional wave spectrum. Algorithms and signal processing software similar to what is used in the processing of heave, pitch, roll buoys. A commercial system called “Directional WaveGuide” is available from the Dutch companies Enraf and Radac.
