Two forms of analysis come in handy for amplifiers: a large signal analysis and a
small signal analysis. Large signal analysis deals with how the amplifier behaves
for large changes in the input voltage,
in other words, changes that are of
the same magnitude as the operating parameters of the amplifier. Large signal
analysis also determines the range of inputs for which the amplifier operates
under the saturation discipline for the reasons discussed in Section 7.5.1. This
section deals with large signal analysis. The next chapter deals with small signal
analysis.
