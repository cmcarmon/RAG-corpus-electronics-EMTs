In March 2016, Anonymous was reported to have declared war on Donald Trump. However, the "Anonymous Official" YouTube channel released a video denouncing #OpTrump as an operation that "goes against everything Anonymous stands for" in reference to censorship and added "we are for everyone letting their voices be heard, even, if the person at hand...is a monster."
Anonymous was also reported to have declared war on Hillary Clinton. Various outlets claiming to represent Anonymous have released attacks on the Clinton campaign.
