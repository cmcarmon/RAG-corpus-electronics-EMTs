EMP energy may be transferred in any of four forms:
Electric field
Magnetic field
Electromagnetic radiation
Electrical conduction
A pulse of any one form of electromagnetic energy will always be accompanied by the other forms, however in a typical pulse one form will dominate.
In general, only radiation acts over long distances, with the others acting over short distances. There are a few exceptions, such as a solar magnetic flare.
