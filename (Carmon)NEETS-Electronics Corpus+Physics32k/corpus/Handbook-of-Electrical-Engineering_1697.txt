Like all imaging processes, whether they are analog or digital, one Ô¨Årst starts with a sensor (or transducer)
that  converts  the  original  imaging  energy  into  an  electrical  signal.  These  sensors,  for  instance,  could  be  the
 electrical voltage.

The transducer system used in ultrasound imaging is an example where sound pressure is converted to electrical
energy;  a  simple  TV  camera  is  perhaps  the  most  ubiquitous  example. An  important  fact  to  note  is  that  the
 process. In other
process of conversion from one energy form to an electrical signal is not necessarily a 
words,  a  proportional  charge  in  the  input  energy  to  the  sensor  will  not  always  cause  the  same  proportional
charge in the output electrical signal. In many cases calibration data are obtained in the laboratory so that the
relationship between the input energy and output electrical signal is known. These data are necessary because
some transducer performance characteristics change with age and other usage factors.
