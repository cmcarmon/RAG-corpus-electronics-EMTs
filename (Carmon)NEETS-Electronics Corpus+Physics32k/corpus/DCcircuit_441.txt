Here, we have three resistors (labeled R1, R2, and R3), connected in a long chain from one
terminal of the battery to the other. (It should be noted that the subscript labeling – those
little numbers to the lower-right of the letter ”R” – are unrelated to the resistor values in
ohms. They serve only to identify one resistor from another.) The deﬁning characteristic of a
series circuit is that there is only one path for electrons to ﬂow. In this circuit the electrons ﬂow
in a counter-clockwise direction, from point 4 to point 3 to point 2 to point 1 and back around
to 4.
