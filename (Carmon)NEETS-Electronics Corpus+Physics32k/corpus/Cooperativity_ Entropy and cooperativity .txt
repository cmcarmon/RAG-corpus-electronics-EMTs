In all of the above types of cooperativity, entropy plays a role. For example, in the case of oxygen binding to hemoglobin, the first oxygen has four different available binding sites. This represents a state of higher entropy compared to a fourth oxygen having one available binding site. Thus, in transition from the unbound to the bound state, the first oxygen must overcome a larger entropy change than the last oxygen in order to bind to the hemoglobin.
