Consider, now, a third inertial observer Dave who is a fixed distance from Alice, and such that Bob lies on the straight line between Alice and Dave. As Alice and Dave are mutually at rest, the delay from Alice to Dave is constant. This means that Dave receives Alice's blue flashes at a rate of once every



T


{\displaystyle T}
seconds, by his clock, the same rate as Alice sends them. In other words, the k-factor from Alice to Dave is equal to one.
Now suppose that whenever Bob receives a blue flash from Alice he immediately sends his own red flash towards Dave, once every



k
T


{\displaystyle kT}
seconds (by Bob's clock). Einstein's second postulate, that the speed of light is independent of the motion of its source, implies that Alice's blue flash and Bob's red flash both travel at the same speed, neither overtaking the other, and therefore arrive at Dave at the same time. So Dave receives a red flash from Bob every



T


{\displaystyle T}
seconds, by Dave's clock, which were sent by Bob every



k
T


{\displaystyle kT}
seconds by Bob's clock. This implies that the k-factor from Bob to Dave is



1

/

k


{\displaystyle 1/k}
.
This establishes that the k-factor for observers moving directly apart (red shift) is the reciprocal of the k-factor for observers moving directly towards each other at the same speed (blue shift).
