The metric needed to measure the distance between any two elements in vector space X often follows in a
natural fashion from the basic structure of the vector space. In particular, many of the vector spaces encountered
in typical applications have an underlying vector norm measure.2 A natural choice of a distance metric on a
normed vector space is speciÔ¨Åed by
