For the purpose of discussion, we have selected the Hewlett-Packard 547A, shown in figure 1-7, as a
representative current tracer. A current tracer will not actually measure current; it is designed to indicate
the presence of current and the relative magnitude of one source of current as compared to another. The
Hewlett-Packard 547A is a hand-held probe that enables you to precisely localize low-impedance faults in
a circuit. The probe senses the magnetic field generated by a pulsing current and lights an indicator lamp
near the current tracer tip. The brightness of the indicator lamp is proportional to the magnitude of the
current. The sensitivity of the indicator lamp can be adjusted with a thumb-wheel potentiometer located
on the probe. Figure 1-8 depicts a typical logic circuit application for a current tracer. Current tracers are
