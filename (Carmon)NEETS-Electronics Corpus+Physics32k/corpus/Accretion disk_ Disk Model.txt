Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) proposed turbulence in the gas as the source of an increased viscosity. Assuming subsonic turbulence and the disk height as an upper limit for the size of the eddies, the disk viscosity can be estimated as

{\displaystyle \nu =\alpha c_{\rm {s}}H}
where

{\displaystyle c_{\rm {s}}}

α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is a free parameter between zero (no accretion) and approximately one. In a turbulent medium

By using the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, combined with conservation of angular momentum and assuming that the disk is thin, the equations of disk structure may be solved in terms of the



α

parameter. Many of the observables depend only weakly on



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
, so this theory is predictive even though it has a free parameter.
Using Kramers' law for the opacity it is found that

The Shakura-Sunyaev α-Disk model is both thermally and viscously unstable. An alternative model, known as the

The Shakura-Sunyaev model assumes that the disk is in local thermal equilibrium, and can radiate its heat efficiently. In this case, the disk radiates away the viscous heat, cools, and becomes geometrically thin. However, this assumption may break down. In the radiatively inefficient case, the disk may "puff up" into a torus or some other three-dimensional solution like an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF). The ADAF solutions usually require that the accretion rate is smaller than a few percent of the Eddington limit. Another extreme is the case of Saturn's rings, where the disk is so gas poor that its angular momentum transport is dominated by solid body collisions and disk-moon gravitational interactions. The model is in agreement with recent astrophysical measurements using gravitational lensing.
