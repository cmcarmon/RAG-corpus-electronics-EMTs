The average lunar distance is increasing, which implies that the Moon was closer in the past. There is geological evidence that the average lunar distance was about 52 R⊕ during the Precambrian Era; 2,500 million years BP.
The giant impact hypothesis, a widely accepted theory, states that the Moon was created as a result of a catastrophic impact between another planet and Earth, resulting in a re-accumulation of fragments at an initial distance of 3.8 R⊕. In this theory, the initial impact is assumed to have occurred 4.5 billion years ago.
