Hydraulic head is a measure of energy, and has many analogs in physics and chemistry, where the same mathematical principles and rules apply:
Hydraulic head is analogous to:
magnetic monopole
electric charge
heat (i.e., temperature)
concentration

A continuous field of the hydraulic head is analogous to:
an electric field
a magnetic field

Similar differential operators can be applied to the fields, to find:
the gradient, or the direction of flow
the divergence of flow
the curl, or if the field is rotating
