allows the possibility of a device whose output voltage is a function of a static magnetic ﬁeld. If two weak links
are connected in parallel, the lumped version of Faraday’s law gives the voltage across the second weak link as
2 = n
1  +  (dF/dt),  where  F  is  the  total  flux  threading  the  loop  between  the  links.  Substituting  Eq.  (53.15),
n
integrating with respect to time, and again setting the integration constant to zero yields
