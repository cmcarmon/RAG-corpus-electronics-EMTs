Let a circuit C with r registers and p local data paths be
described by a graph g , and let a skew basis (spanning tree) for
this circuit (graph) be identiÔ¨Åed. For the remainder of this
work, it is assumed that the skews have been enumerated such
that those skews from the skew basis have the highest indices.13
Introducing the notation sb for the basis and sc for the chords,
the clock schedule s can be expressed as:
