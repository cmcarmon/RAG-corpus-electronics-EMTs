Regulations control the maximum sound power level LWA that a device (e.g. vacuum cleaner) is allowed to produce. The A-weighting scale is used in the calculation as the regulation is concerned with the loudness as perceived by the human ear. Measurements are taken at several defined points around the device.
The test environment can be located indoors or outdoors. The ideal environment is on the ground in a large open space or hemi-anechoic chamber (free-field over a reflecting plane ). To account for undesired reflections from nearby objects, walls, and the ceiling, and for any residual background noises, measurement corrections are applied.
