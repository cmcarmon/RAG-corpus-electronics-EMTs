An op amp circuit with two storage elements that cannot be combined
into a single equivalent element is second-order. Because inductors are
bulky and heavy, they are rarely used in practical op amp circuits. For
this  reason,  we  will  only  consider  RC second-order  op  amp  circuits
here. Such circuits ﬁnd a wide range of applications in devices such as
ﬁlters and oscillators.
