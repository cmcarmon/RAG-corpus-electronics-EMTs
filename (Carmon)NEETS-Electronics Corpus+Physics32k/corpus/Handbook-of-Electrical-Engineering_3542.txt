Simulation
Simulation exercises a design over a period of time by applying a series of input stimuli and generating the
associated  output  responses.  The  general  event-driven,  also  called  schedule-driven,  simulation  algorithm  is
diagrammed  in  Fig. 34.13.  An  event  is  a  change  in  signal  value.  Simulation  starts  by  initializing  the  design;
