Attenuation
The assumption of a nonconducting medium for dielectric waveguides led to solutions to the wave equation
with no attenuation component. In practice, various mechanisms give rise to losses in lightwave waveguides.
These mechanisms contribute a loss factor of e –a z to Eq. (42.10) and comparable ﬁeld expressions, where a  is
the attenuation coefﬁcient. The attenuation due to these mechanisms and the resulting total attenuation as a
function of wavelength is shown in Fig. 42.11 [Osanai et al., 1976]. Note that the range of wavelengths (0.8 to
1.6 mm) in which communication ﬁbers are usually operated corresponds to a region of low overall attenuation.
Brief discussions follow of the mechanisms responsible for the various types of attenuation shown in Fig. 42.11.
