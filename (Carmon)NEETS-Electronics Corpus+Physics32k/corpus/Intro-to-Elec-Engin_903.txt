Now our goal is to develop an equivalent circuit of a practical transformer by including the
nonideal effects. First, let us consider the simple magnetic circuit of Figure 11.2.1(a), excited by
an ac mmf, and come up with its equivalent circuit. With no coil resistance and no core loss,
but with a ﬁnite constant permeability of the core, the magnetic circuit along with the coil can
be represented just by an inductance Lm or, equivalently, by an inductive reactance Xm = ωLm,
when the coil is excited by a sinusoidal ac voltage of frequency f = ω/2π. This reactance is
known as the magnetizing reactance. Thus, Figure 11.3.2(a) shows Xm (or impedance ¯Z = j Xm)
across which the terminal voltage with an rms value of V1 (equal to the induced voltage E1)
is applied.
