where y(t ) 2 Rp is the vector of outputs and where R(D) and
W (D) are differential operator matrices of compatible dimen-
sions. The system representation introduced in equations 3.1
and 3.2 is commonly referred to as the polynomial matrix
description (PMD) and is the most natural representation for
many engineering processes. For analysis and design, a state-
space representation that is an equivalent representation of
