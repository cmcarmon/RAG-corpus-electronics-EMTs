release the free token unless the leading edge of the
busy token is returned. The Multiple Token protocol
releases the free token as soon as it has completed
transmitting release occurs even if the busy token has
not returned). The Single Frame protocol waits until
all of data has been purged and then releases a free
token. In general, if the frame length is smaller than
the ring length measured in bit time, the multiple
protocols have better
throughput. Regardless of
which protocol is used, the length of a ring should
be long enough to hold a free token.
