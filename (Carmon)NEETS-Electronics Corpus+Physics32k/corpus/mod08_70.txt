shape and frequency. In some cases, there may be a phase difference between the input and output signal 
(usually 180ยบ), but the signals are still considered to be "good copies." If the output signal is not like the 
input signal in shape or frequency, the signal is said to be DISTORTED. DISTORTION is any undesired 
change in a signal from input to output.
