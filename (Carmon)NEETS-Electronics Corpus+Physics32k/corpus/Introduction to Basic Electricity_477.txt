■● Religion: It is illegal for employers to  discriminate 
based on an individual’s religious beliefs. Employ-
ers are required to reasonably accommodate an 
employee’s religious beliefs, as long as doing so 
does not have excessive negative consequences on 
the workplace.
Under federal laws, employers are prohibited from 
treating employees unfairly or discriminating against 
employees based on the characteristics that are legally 
protected. It is also illegal for an employer to retaliate 
against an employee who has filed a discrimination 
complaint or who has participated in an investigation 
regarding a discrimination complaint.
