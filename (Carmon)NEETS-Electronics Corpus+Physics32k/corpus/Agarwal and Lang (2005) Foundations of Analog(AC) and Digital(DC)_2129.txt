s i n g l e - e n d e d a m p l i f i e r Circuits containing
single-input amplifiers can be analyzed in much the same way as circuits containing
Op Amps, as this example shows. Consider the circuit shown in Figure 15.9, which
contains a single-input inverting amplifier having gain −A. Except for its finite gain, the
amplifier is assumed to be ideal. Thus, its input current is zero, it drives vOUT = −AvMID,
and its negative feedback makes the circuit stable.
