There are some things that a free body diagram explicitly excludes. Although other sketches that include these things may be helpful in visualizing a problem, a proper free body diagram should not show:
Bodies other than the free body.
Constraints.
(The body is not free from constraints; the constraints have just been replaced by the forces and moments that they exert on the body.)

Forces exerted by the free body.
(A diagram showing the forces exerted both on and by a body is likely to be confusing since all the forces will cancel out. By Newton's 3rd law if body A exerts a force on body B then B exerts an equal and opposite force on A. This should not be confused with the equal and opposite forces that are necessary to hold a body in equilibrium.)

Internal forces.
(For example, if an entire truss is being analyzed, the forces between the individual truss members are not included.)

Velocity or acceleration vectors.
