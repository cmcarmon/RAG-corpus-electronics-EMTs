the periodic nature of the discrete Fourier transform. The FFT simply reuses the computations made in
2πk
the half-length transforms and combines them through additions and the multiplication by e
N , which is
not periodic over N
, to rewrite the length-N DFT. Figure 5.12 illustrates this decomposition. As it stands,
2
we now compute two length- N
2
exponential (complexity O (N )), and add the results (complexity O (N )). At this point, the total complexity
is still dominated by the half-length DFT calculations, but the proportionality coeﬃcient has been reduced.
Now for the fun. Because N = 2L, each of the half-length transforms can be reduced to two quarter-
length transforms, each of these to two eighth-length ones, etc. This decomposition continues until we are
left with length-2 transforms. This transform is quite simple, involving only additions. Thus, the ﬁrst stage
of the FFT has N
length-2 transforms (see the bottom part of Figure 5.12). Pairs of these transforms are
2
combined by adding one to the other multiplied by a complex exponential. Each pair requires 6 additions
and 4 multiplications, giving a total number of computations equaling 10 · N
. This number of
4
computations does not change from stage to stage. Because the number of stages, the number of times the
length can be divided by two, equals log2N, the complexity of the FFT is O (N log2N ).
