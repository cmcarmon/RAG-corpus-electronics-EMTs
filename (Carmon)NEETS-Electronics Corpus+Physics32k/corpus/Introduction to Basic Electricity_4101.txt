An integrator circuit is similar to a differentiator 
except that the output is taken across the capacitor  
 (Figure 40-14). Figure 40-15 shows the result of 
 applying a square wave to an integrator. The integrator  
changes the waveform in a different way than the 
 differentiator. Figure 40-16 shows the effects of differ-
ent RC time constants.
