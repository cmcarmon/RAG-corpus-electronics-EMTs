The ARTS-I is being used in industrial applications with six tool positions ranging from coarse sanding
disks  and  abrasive  wheels  to  cloth  polishing  wheels  with  motors  of  various  horsepower.  The ARTS-II
allows a robot to exchange a welding torch for a CFD end effector to ﬁnish a welded assembly with a
welding robot; using a second tool-changer (ARTS-I) enables ﬁnishing the surface conditioning process.
