Here z is the damping ratio with a value of less than 1. The
magnitude and phase Bode diagrams are drawn by adding the
individual plots of the ﬁrst- and second-order terms. Asymp-
totic plots are ﬁrst easily sketched by using approximations. For
making asymptotic Bode plots, the ratio v=v0 is assumed to be
much smaller than one or much larger than one, so the Bode
plots become straight line segments called asymptotic approxi-
mations. The normalizing frequency v0 is called the corner
frequency. The asymptotic approximations are corrected at
the corner frequencies by calculating the exact value of magni-
tude and phase functions at the corner frequencies.
