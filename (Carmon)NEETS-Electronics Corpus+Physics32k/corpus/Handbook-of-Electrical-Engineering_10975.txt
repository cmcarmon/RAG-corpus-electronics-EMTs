where fe and fo are constants that determine the points of upturn in the strength-frequency curve at high and
£ 4.6 is assumed for Eq. (113.16) to account for the fact that
low frequencies, respectively. An upper limit of KL 
excitation may be obtained with ﬁnite dc currents. An empirical ﬁt of Eqs. (113.15) and (113.16) to the mylinated
nerve model thresholds indicates that a = 1.45 for a single-cycle stimulus and a = 0.9 for a continuous stimulus;
b  =  0.8  regardless  of  stimulus  duration.  The  value  of  Io will  depend  on  various  conditions  of  stimulation,
including the size of the electrode, its location on the body, and the location of the stimulated nerve.
