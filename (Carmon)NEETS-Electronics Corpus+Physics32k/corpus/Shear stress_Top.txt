A shear stress, often denoted Ï„ (Greek: tau), is the component of stress coplanar with a material cross section. Shear stress arises from the force vector component parallel to the cross section. Normal stress, on the other hand, arises from the force vector component perpendicular to the material cross section on which it acts.
Shear stress arises from shear forces, which are pairs of equal and opposing forces acting on opposite sides of an object.
