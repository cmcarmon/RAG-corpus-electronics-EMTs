¥ . If a resistance is connected between points A and B, it shunts some of the current from the meter
movement and the meter movement reacts to this lower current. Since the scale of the meter is marked in
ohms, the resistance of the shunting resistor (between points A and B) is indicated. Notice that the switch
has an OFF position, as well as positions for R ·  1, R ·  10, and R ·  100. This is provided to stop current
flow and prevents the battery from being discharged while the meter is not being used.
