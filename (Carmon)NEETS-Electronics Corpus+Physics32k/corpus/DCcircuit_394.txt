When switching a multimeter from current- to voltage-measuring mode, its easy to spin
the selector switch from the ”A” to the ”V” position and forget to correspondingly switch the
position of the red test lead plug from ”A” to ”V”. The result – if the meter is then connected
across a source of substantial voltage – will be a short-circuit through the meter!
