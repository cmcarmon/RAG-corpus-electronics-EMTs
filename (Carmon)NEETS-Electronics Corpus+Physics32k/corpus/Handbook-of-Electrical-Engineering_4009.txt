FIGURE 39.15 Current gains versus frequency for bipolar transistors. The common-emitter and common-base current
gains are designated as b and a, respectively. The subscript “o” indicates the dc value. The gains decrease with frequency
above a certain value. The frequencies where the gains are reduced by 3 dB from their dc values are indicated as the CE and
CB cutoff frequencies, fb and fa, respectively. The frequency at which the CE current gain is reduced to unity is deﬁned as
the gain-bandwidth product fT. Note that the CB current gain is restricted to values less than unity and that the CE current
gain has values that signiﬁcantly exceed unity.
