You can usually test a traveling-wave tube (twt) in the equipment in which it is used. When the twt is
installed, you can usually measure the collector current and voltage and check the power output for
various inputs. Any deviation greater than 10% from normal specifications may be considered to be an
indication of a defective tube. Most amplifiers are supplied with built-in panel meters and selector
switches so that the cathode, anode, helix, focus, and collector currents may be measured. Thus,
continuous monitoring of amplifier operation and tube evaluation is possible. Adjustments usually are
provided for you to set the helix, grid bias, and collector voltages for optimum operation. If variation of
these controls will not produce normal currents and if all voltages are normal, you should consider the
tube to be defective and replace it with a new tube or one known to be in good operating condition. To
avoid needless replacement of tubes, however, you should make an additional check by measuring the
input power and output power and determining the tube gain. If, with normal operating conditions, the
gain level drops below the minimum indicated value in the equipment technical manual, the tube is
defective.
