The convergence with probability 1 in equation 13.35 is also
called convergence almost truly. In this chapter, the Robbins-
Monro algorithm is applied to optimization problems (Kusher
and Yin, 1997). In that setting, g (w) Â¼ qE=qW , where E is an
objective function to be optimized. If E has a local optimum at
w, g (w) will satisfy the condition C1 locally at w. If E has a
quadratic form, g(w) will satisfy the condition C1 globally.
