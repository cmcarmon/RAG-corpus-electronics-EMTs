Consider a heuristic related to the computational complex-
ity of digital ﬁlters in a full custom design (Dempster, 1995).
Figure 2.26 shows an intuitive plot of complexity as a function
of ﬁlter order for all digital ﬁlter implementations meant to
satisfy a given set of speciﬁcations. The complexity of a digital
ﬁlter is measured in terms of number of bits used in the
