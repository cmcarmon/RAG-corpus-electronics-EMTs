Bridges designed specifically for capacitance measurements provide a dc source of potential for 
electrolytic capacitors. The electrolytic capacitors often require the application of dc polarizing voltages 
in order for them to exhibit the same capacitance values and dissipation factors that would be obtained in 
actual circuit operation. The dc power supply and meter circuits used for this purpose are connected so 
that there is no interference with the normal operation of the capacitance-measuring bridge circuit. The 
dissipation factor of the capacitor may be obtained while the capacitor is polarized. In figure 3-2, the 
signal voltage in the A and B branches of the bridge will be divided in proportion to the resistance ratios 
of its component members, RA and RB, for the range of values selected. The same signal voltage is 
impressed across the branches S and X of the bridge. The variable control, RS, is rotated to change the 
current flowing through the S and X branches of the bridge. When the voltage drop across branch S is 
equal to the voltage drop across branch A, the voltage drop across branch X is equal to the voltage drop 
across branch B. At this time the potentials across the detector circuit are the same, resulting in no current 
flow through the detector circuit and an indication of zero-current flow. The bridge is balanced at these 
settings of its operating controls, and they cannot be placed at any other setting and still maintain this 
balanced condition.
