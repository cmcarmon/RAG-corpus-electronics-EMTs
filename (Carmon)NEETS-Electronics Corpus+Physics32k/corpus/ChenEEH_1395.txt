conﬁgurable memory blocks and special-purpose input/output
blocks supporting boundary-scan testing (Trimberger, 1994).
Many experimental FPGA architectures support run-time
reconﬁguration. Tau et al., (1995) have come up with an
FPGA that stores multiple conﬁgurations in memory banks.
In a single clock cycle, which is in the order of tens or hun-
dreds of nanoseconds, the chip can replace conﬁguration by
another without erasing partially processed data.
