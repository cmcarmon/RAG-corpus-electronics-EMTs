specialization, the 2-D array of sensors leads to the theory of 3-D ﬁltering involving a transfer function in the
frequency wavenumber variables f, k1, and k2. The basic design equations for the optimum, in the least-mean-
square error sense, frequency wavenumber ﬁlters have been developed [Burg, 1964]. This procedure of Burg
can be routinely generalized to the 4-D ﬁltering problem mentioned above.
