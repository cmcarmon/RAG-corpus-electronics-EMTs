When the phase transition of a substance is between a gas phase and a condensed phase (liquid or solid), and occurs at temperatures much lower than the critical temperature of that substance, the specific volume of the gas phase

{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {g} }}
greatly exceeds that of the condensed phase

. Therefore, one may approximate

{\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{\mathrm {g} }\left(1-{\tfrac {v_{\mathrm {c} }}{v_{\mathrm {g} }}}\right)\approx v_{\mathrm {g} }}

These last equations are useful because they relate equilibrium or saturation vapor pressure and temperature to the latent heat of the phase change, without requiring specific volume data.
