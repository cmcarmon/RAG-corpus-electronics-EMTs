A microprocessor is the heart of a microcomputer. 
It contains four basic parts: registers, arithmetic logic 
unit, timing and control circuitry, and decoding cir-
cuitry. A microprocessor is designed so that an in-
struction, or program, can be fetched from memory, 
placed in the instruction register, and decoded. The 
program affects all the timing, control, and decoding 
circuitry. The program allows the operator to route 
data in or out of various registers or into the arithme-
tic logic unit. The registers and the arithmetic logic 
unit are used by the microprocessor for data or infor-
mation manipulation.
