Since pipelining is a common technique to increase the
speed of a circuit, it would be advantageous to minimize
reconﬁguration time of these types of circuits. Further reduc-
tions in reconﬁguration overhead can be achieved by avoiding
latency associated with emptying and reﬁlling the pipeline
during reconﬁguration. Figure 3.2 describes a technique for
overlapping computation and reconﬁguration that can be im-
plemented using either existing FPGAs (Luk et al., 1997) or a
