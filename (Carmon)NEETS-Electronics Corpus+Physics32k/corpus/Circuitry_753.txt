As  mentioned earlier, the simple circuit of Fig. 
16.11  is  unsuitable  for  use  when  the  state  of  the 
switch is regularly changing. The reason for this is 
that  the  switching  action  of  most  switches  is  far 
from  ‘clean’  (i.e.  the  switch  contacts  make  and 
break  several 
is 
operated).  This  may  not  be  a  problem  when  the 
state  of  a  switch  remains  static  during  program 
execution  but  it  can  give  rise  to  serious  problems 
when dealing with, for example, an operator switch 
bank or keypad.
