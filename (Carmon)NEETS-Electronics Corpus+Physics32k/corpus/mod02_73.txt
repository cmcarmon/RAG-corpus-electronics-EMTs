This induced emf opposes the growth of the current and the growth of the magnetic field. If the increasing 
current had not set up a magnetic field, there would have been no opposition to its growth. The whole 
reaction, or opposition, is caused by the creation or collapse of the magnetic field, the lines of which as 
they expand or contract cut across the conductor and develop the counter emf.
