Young's modulus E, can be calculated by dividing the tensile stress,

{\displaystyle \sigma (\varepsilon )}
, by the engineering extensional strain,



ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
, in the elastic (initial, linear) portion of the physical stress–strain curve:

{\displaystyle E\equiv {\frac {\sigma (\varepsilon )}{\varepsilon }}={\frac {F/A}{\Delta L/L_{0}}}={\frac {FL_{0}}{A\Delta L}}}

where
E is the Young's modulus (modulus of elasticity)
F is the force exerted on an object under tension;
A is the actual cross-sectional area, which equals the area of the cross-section perpendicular to the applied force;
ΔL is the amount by which the length of the object changes (ΔL is positive if the material is stretched , and negative when the material is compressed);
L0 is the original length of the object.
