The forward jump and backward jump operators represent the closest point in the time scale on the right and left of a given point



t


{\displaystyle t}
, respectively. Formally:




σ
(
t
)
=
inf
{
s
∈

T

:
s
>
t
}


{\displaystyle \sigma (t)=\inf\{s\in \mathbb {T} :s>t\}}
(forward shift operator / forward jump operator)




ρ
(
t
)
=
sup
{
s
∈

T

:
s
<
t
}


{\displaystyle \rho (t)=\sup\{s\in \mathbb {T} :s<t\}}
(backward shift operator / backward jump operator)

The graininess



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the distance from a point to the closest point on the right and is given by:




μ
(
t
)
=
σ
(
t
)
−
t
.


{\displaystyle \mu (t)=\sigma (t)-t.}


For a right-dense



t


{\displaystyle t}
,



σ
(
t
)
=
t


{\displaystyle \sigma (t)=t}
and



μ
(
t
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \mu (t)=0}
.
For a left-dense



t


{\displaystyle t}
,



ρ
(
t
)
=
t
.


{\displaystyle \rho (t)=t.}
