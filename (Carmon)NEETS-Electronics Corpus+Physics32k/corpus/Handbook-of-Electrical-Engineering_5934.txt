Lear is perhaps best known for his development of small corporate jet aircraft known as Learjets in
the  1960s.  He  patented  the  ﬁrst  practical  car  radio  in  the  1930s  that  launched  today’s  giant  Motorola
Company. He also developed the eight-track tape system for autos in the 1960s and before his death in
1978, he designed the Lear fan, a high speed propeller aircraft made entirely from composites. (Copyright
