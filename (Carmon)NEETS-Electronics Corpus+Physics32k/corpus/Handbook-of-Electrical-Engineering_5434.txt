Standard Voltages
Standard transmission voltages are established in the United States by the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI). There is no clear delineation between distribution, subtransmission, and transmission voltage levels.
Table 61.2 shows the standard voltages listed in ANSI Standard C84 and C92.2, all of which are in use at present.
