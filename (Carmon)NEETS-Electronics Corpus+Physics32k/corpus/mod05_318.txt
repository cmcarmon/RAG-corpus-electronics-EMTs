The stator construction of the three-phase induction motor and the three-phase synchronous motor
are almost identical. However, their rotors are completely different (see fig. 4-8). The induction rotor is
made of a laminated cylinder with slots in its surface. The windings in these slots are one of two types
(shown in fig. 4-9). The most common is the squirrel-cage winding. This entire winding is made up of
