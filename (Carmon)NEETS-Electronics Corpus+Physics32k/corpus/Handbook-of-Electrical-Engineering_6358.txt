DAB reception begins in a similar manner as is used in virtually all receivers. A receiving antenna feeds an
appropriate stage of RF selectivity and ampliÔ¨Åcation from which a sample of the coded DAB signal is derived.
This signal then drives a channel decoder, which reconstructs the audio and auxiliary data streams. To accom-
plish this task, the channel decoder must demodulate and de-interleave the data contained on the RF carrier
and then apply appropriate computational and statistical error correction functions.
