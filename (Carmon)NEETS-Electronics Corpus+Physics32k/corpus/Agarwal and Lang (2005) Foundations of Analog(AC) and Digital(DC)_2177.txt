where the time origin is now defined to be at the instant of negative transition
of vi. Appropriate waveforms are shown in Figure 15.29c. As noted earlier, this
saturation state persists until v
has decayed almost to zero. Only then will the
Op Amp come out of saturation, and integrate back toward zero, as shown in
Figure 15.29c.
