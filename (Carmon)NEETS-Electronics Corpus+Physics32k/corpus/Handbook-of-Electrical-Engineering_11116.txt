To clarify the sequence of biological events that occurs when PEMF signals are applied to developing bone,
the following in vivo experiment was performed [Aaron et al., 1989]. Twenty-ﬁve milligrams of demineralized
rat bone matrix in powdered form was implanted along the thoracic musculature of immature rats. This powder
recruits  cells  from  the  surrounding  tissue  leading  to  formation  of  cartilage  within  6  to  10  days;  thereafter
progressive calciﬁcation occurs, leading to formation of ﬁbrous particles by days 12 to 14 and formation of a
small bone (“ossicle”). These developments were compared in a large number of paired rats, with equal numbers
unexposed and exposed (8 h/day) to the PEMF signal illustrated on Figs. 113.32 and 113.33 (A in Table 113.2).
Estimates of the mean electric ﬁelds in the exposed tissues give values equal to about one-fourth of those listed
on line 1 in Table 113.3. Chemical and histological analysis of ossicles harvested from animals, sacriﬁced on
every second day, showed that exposure to this PEMF signal at the applied level signiﬁcantly increased both
rate and quantity of cartilage formation and enhanced maturation of the subsequent bone. The experimenters
concluded that ﬁeld exposure either enhanced recruitment or proliferation of cartilage precursor cells, increased
differentiation of precursor to cartilage cells, or accelerated maturation of cartilage cells.
