The future for polycentric networks can be found in sustainability efforts seen around the globe. Perry Pei-Ju Yang conducted research in Singapore around the cities push for greater sustainability in relation to ecology. With globalization and the separation of land comes split ecosystems and habitats that get manipulated to form infrastructure, for human development. A big issue for the future of sustainability is how to minimize our environmental impact but continue to thrive as a species.
In Yangâ€™s research, they explored Singapore throughout different time periods. Starting in 1986 it is apparent that by 1994 and again to 2002 that much of the growth in Singapore revolves around areas of industrial development, even though these areas were spread out all throughout the island. Yang noted that most of this growth revolves around the mass-rapid transit (MRT) which connects areas of Island. The general shift seen in Singapore can be seen as the impact of polycentric networks throughout the island with the implementation of rezoning policies. From 1986 to 1994 a mass amount of rezoning occurred due to a change in policy which switched what desirable land use was in Singapore.
The transformation that Singapore experienced can be used as a marker for future growth. The research found that transit, as well as raw material, are central places for growth to occur in areas of quick development. Yang argues that Singapore is a good example of a polycentric urban form, however, it may not be strong enough to establish an urban sustainability model.
