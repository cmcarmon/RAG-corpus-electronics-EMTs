A nontrivial example of FTHN application is found in Zhou
et al. (2000), where the FTHN method has been used to model
networked virtual-reality systems, such as Cave Automatic Vir-
tual Environment (CAVE) and Narrative Immersive Construc-
tionist/Collaborative Environments (NICE) projects at the
University of Illinois at Chicago. Using the FTHN models,
various simulations have been conducted to study real-time
behaviors, network effects, and performance (latencies and
jitters) of the NICE. The simulation results are consistent with
data and measurements obtained experimentally. This study
shows how powerful FTHN models are in specifying and ana-
lyzing performance and how helpful the performance analysis
is in improving a real-time networked-virtual-environment
system design process.
