5.12 Discrete-Time Systems in the Time-Domain26
A discrete-time signal s (n) is delayed by n0 samples when we write s (n âˆ’ n0), with n0 > 0. Choosing n0
to be negative advances the signal along the integers. As opposed to analog delays, discrete-time delays can
only be integer valued. In the frequency domain, delaying a signal corresponds to a linear phase shift of the
