In the physics of gas molecules, the root-mean-square speed is defined as the square root of the average squared-speed. The RMS speed of an ideal gas is calculated using the following equation:






v

RMS



=




3
R
T


M






{\displaystyle {v_{\text{RMS}}}={\sqrt {3RT \over {M}}}}

where R represents the ideal gas constant, 8.314 J/(molÂ·K), T is the temperature of the gas in kelvins, and M is the molar mass of the gas in kilograms per mole. The generally accepted terminology for speed as compared to velocity is that the former is the scalar magnitude of the latter. Therefore, although the average speed is between zero and the RMS speed, the average velocity for a stationary gas is zero.
