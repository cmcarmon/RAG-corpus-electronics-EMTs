During the first part of the intermediate ballistics period the real velocity of the projectile increases. It is caused by the propellant gases exiting the muzzle. For that reason the real maximum projectile velocity (Vmax) is higher than the real muzzle velocity (Vr). The external ballistics uses so-called initial velocity Vo, which is not the same as the real muzzle velocity. The initial velocity Vo is calculated via an extrapolation of the decaying part of velocity curve to the position of the muzzle (to). The difference between these two velocities is visible in the chart.
