1/2t: that is, t-spaced sampling satisﬁes the sampling theorem. In an analog implementation, there is no other
restriction on t, and the output of the equalizer can be sampled at the symbol rate. In a digital implementation
t must be KT/M, where K and M are integers and M > K. (In practice, it is convenient to choose t = T/M,
where M is a small integer, e.g., 2.) The received signal is sampled and shifted into the equalizer delay line at
a rate M/T, and one input is produced each symbol interval (for every M input sample). In general, the equalizer
output is given by
