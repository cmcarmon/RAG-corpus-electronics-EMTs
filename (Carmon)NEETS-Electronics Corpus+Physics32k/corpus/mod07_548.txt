When the load current increases above 600 milliamperes, the voltage drop across R4 increases to 
more than 0.6 volt. This causes Q2 to conduct through resistor R2, thereby decreasing the voltage on the 
base of pass transistor Q1. This action causes Q1 to conduct less. Therefore, the current cannot increase 
above 600 to 700 milliamperes.
