DES algorithm: Data Encryption Standard algorithm is the most popular encryption/decryption mathemat-
ical  engine.  DES  is  being  broadly  applied  in  the  security  domain  for  encryption/decryption  purposes,
secure messaging, and authentication. Best known is 56-bit encryption/decryption key version. For more
sophisticated  security  applications,  3DES  (triple  DES)  is  being  applied.  3DES  is  a  method  using  DES
three consecutive times with a different encryption key used each time.
