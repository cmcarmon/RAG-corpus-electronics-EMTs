The  instruction  explicitly  speciﬁes  the  size  and  indicates  how  the  CPU  should  calculate  the  address.  An
instruction  to  load  a  byte,  for  example,  is  LB,  MOVE.B,  or  MOVB  on  the  SPARC,  MC68000,  and  VAX,
respectively. These are followed immediately by an expression which speciﬁes an address. We will discuss how
to specify an address later. First, we must introduce the concept of a register.
