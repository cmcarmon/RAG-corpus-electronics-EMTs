Views (A), (B), and (C) shown in figure 2-10 can be used to build the basic Armstrong oscillator. 
View (A) shows a conventional amplifier. R2 provides the forward bias for Q1, C2 is a coupling 
capacitor, and L1 and R1 form the collector load impedance. This is a common-emitter configuration 
which provides the 180-degree phase shift between the base and collector.
