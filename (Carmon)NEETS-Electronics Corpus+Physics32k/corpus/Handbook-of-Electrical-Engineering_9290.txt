Synergistic combinations of defect prevention and defect removal operations, accompanied by careful mea-
surements  and  the  long-range  calibration  of  inspection  and  test  efÔ¨Åciencies,  can  give  software-producing
organizations  the  ability  to  consistently  create  stable  and  reliable  software  packages.  As  the  state  of  the  art
advances,  both  six-sigma  quality  levels  or  even  zero-defect  quality  levels  may  be  achievable.  Achieving  high
quality levels also reduces development schedules and lowers development costs.
