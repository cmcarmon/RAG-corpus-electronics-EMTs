The relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and Cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple pendulum.
A simple pendulum consists of a mass M hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius L. The position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector r=(x, y) measured in the plane of the circle such that y is in the vertical direction. The coordinates x and y are related by the equation of the circle




f

)

{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}-L^{2}=0,}

that constrains the movement of M. This equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components,

{\displaystyle {\dot {f}}(x,y)=2x{\dot {x}}+2y{\dot {y}}=0.}

Now introduce the parameter θ, that defines the angular position of M from the vertical direction. It can be used to define the coordinates x and y, such that





r

=
(
x
,
y
)
=
(

,
−

)
.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =(x,y)=(L\sin \theta ,-L\cos \theta ).}

The use of θ to define the configuration of this system avoids the constraint provided by the equation of the circle.
Notice that the force of gravity acting on the mass m is formulated in the usual Cartesian coordinates,





F

=
(
0
,
−
m
g
)
,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =(0,-mg),}

where g is the acceleration of gravity.
The virtual work of gravity on the mass m as it follows the trajectory r is given by




δ
W
=

F

⋅

.


{\displaystyle \delta W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \delta \mathbf {r} .}

The variation δr can be computed in terms of the coordinates x and y, or in terms of the parameter θ,

{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} =(\delta x,\delta y)=(L\cos \theta ,L\sin \theta )\delta \theta .}

Thus, the virtual work is given by

{\displaystyle \delta W=-mg\delta y=-mgL\sin \theta \delta \theta .}

Notice that the coefficient of δy is the y-component of the applied force. In the same way, the coefficient of δθ is known as the generalized force along generalized coordinate θ, given by

{\displaystyle F_{\theta }=-mgL\sin \theta .}

To complete the analysis consider the kinetic energy T of the mass, using the velocity,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =({\dot {x}},{\dot {y}})=(L\cos \theta ,L\sin \theta ){\dot {\theta }},}

so,

{\displaystyle T={\frac {1}{2}}m\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} ={\frac {1}{2}}m({\dot {x}}^{2}+{\dot {y}}^{2})={\frac {1}{2}}mL^{2}{\dot {\theta }}^{2}.}

D'Alembert's form of the principle of virtual work for the pendulum in terms of the coordinates x and y are given by,

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {x}}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial x}}=F_{x}+\lambda {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}},\quad {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial T}{\partial {\dot {y}}}}-{\frac {\partial T}{\partial y}}=F_{y}+\lambda {\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}.}

This yields the three equations

in the three unknowns, x, y and λ.
Using the parameter θ, those equations take the form

{\displaystyle {\ddot {\theta }}+{\frac {g}{L}}\sin \theta =0.}

This formulation yields one equation because there is a single parameter and no constraint equation.
This shows that the parameter θ is a generalized coordinate that can be used in the same way as the Cartesian coordinates x and y to analyze the pendulum.
