You learned earlier in the section on ground waves that surface waves suffer most of their absorption 
losses because of ground-induced voltage. Sky waves, on the other hand, suffer most of their absorption 
losses because of conditions in the ionosphere. Note that some absorption of sky waves may also occur at 
lower atmospheric levels because of the presence of water and water vapor. However, this becomes 
important only at frequencies above 10,000 megahertz.
