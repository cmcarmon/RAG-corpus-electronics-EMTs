A sinusoidal oscillator produces a sine-wave output signal. Ideally, the output signal is of constant 
amplitude with no variation in frequency. Actually, something less than this is usually obtained. The 
degree to which the ideal is approached depends upon such factors as class of amplifier operation, 
amplifier characteristics, frequency stability, and amplitude stability.
