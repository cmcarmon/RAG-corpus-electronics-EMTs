The double pendulum undergoes chaotic motion, and shows a sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The image to the right shows the amount of elapsed time before the pendulum flips over, as a function of initial position when released at rest. Here, the initial value of θ1 ranges along the x-direction from −3 to 3. The initial value θ2 ranges along the y-direction, from −3 to 3. The colour of each pixel indicates whether either pendulum flips within:
10√​l⁄g (green)
100√​l⁄g (red)
1000√​l⁄g (purple) or
10000√​l⁄g (blue).
Initial conditions that do not lead to a flip within 10000√​l⁄g are plotted white.
The boundary of the central white region is defined in part by energy conservation with the following curve:

Within the region defined by this curve, that is if

{\displaystyle 3\cos \theta _{1}+\cos \theta _{2}>2,}

then it is energetically impossible for either pendulum to flip. Outside this region, the pendulum can flip, but it is a complex question to determine when it will flip. Similar behavior is observed for a double pendulum composed of two point masses rather than two rods with distributed mass.
The lack of a natural excitation frequency has led to the use of double pendulum systems in seismic resistance designs in buildings, where the building itself is the primary inverted pendulum, and a secondary mass is connected to complete the double pendulum.
