(τ

dis). The strengths of these various scattering
mechanisms depend on certain lattice parameters, such as dielectric constants and deformation potentials, and
extrinsic factors, such as donor, acceptor, and dislocation concentrations, ND, NA, and Ndis, respectively [Rode,
1975;  Wiley,  1975;  Nag,  1980;  Look,  1989;  Look,  1998].  The  total  momentum  scattering  rate,  or  inverse
relaxation time, is
