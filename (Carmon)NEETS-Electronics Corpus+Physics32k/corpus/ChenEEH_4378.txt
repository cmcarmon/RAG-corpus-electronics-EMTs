Because v is positive deﬁnite and radially unbounded and _vv(2:7)
is negative deﬁnite, the equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of equation 2.7 is
asymptotically stable in the large.
Lyapunov instability theorem: The equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of
equation 2.2 is unstable if there exists a continuously differ-
entiable function v such that _vv(2:2) is negative deﬁnite (positive
deﬁnite) and if in every neighborhood of the origin there are
points x such that v(x) < 0[v(x) > 0].
