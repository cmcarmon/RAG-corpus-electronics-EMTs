Consider two Lie groups G and H and Aut H, the automorphism group of H. The latter is the group of isomorphisms of H. If there is a Lie group homomorphism Φ:G → Aut H, then for each g ∈ G there is a Φ(g) ≡ Φg ∈ Aut H with the property Φgg' = ΦgΦg', g,g' ∈ G. Denote with E the set H × G and define multiplication by

Then E is a group with identity (eH, eG) and the inverse is given by (h, g)−1 = (Φg−1(h−1), g−1). Using the expression for the inverse and equation (4) it is seen that H is normal in E. Denote the group with this semidirect product as E = H ⊗S G.
Conversely, if E = H ⊗S G is a given semidirect product expression of the group E, then by definition H is normal in E and Cg(h) ∈ Aut H for each g ∈ G where Cg(h) ≡ ghg−1 and the map Φ:g ↦ Cg is a homomorphism.
Now make use of the Lie correspondence. The maps Φg:H → H, g ∈ G each induce, at the level of Lie algebras, a map Ψg:h → h. This map is computed by

For instance, if G and H are both subgroups of a larger group E and Φg = ghg−1, then

and one recognizes Ψ as the adjoint action Ad of E on h restricted to G. Now Ψ:G → Aut h [ ⊂ GL(h) if h is finite-dimensional] is a homomorphism, and appealing once more to the Lie correspondence, there is a unique Lie algebra homomorphism ψ:g → Lie(Aut h) = Der h ⊂ gl(h). This map is (formally) given by

for example, if Ψ = Ad, then (formally)

where a relationship between Ad and the adjoint action ad rigorously proved in here is used.
Lie algebra
The Lie algebra is, as a vector space, e = h ⊕ g. This is clear since GH generates E and G ∩ H = (eH, eG). The Lie bracket is given by
