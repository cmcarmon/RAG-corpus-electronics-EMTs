Radar signal characteristics (fundamentals of the radar signal)
Doppler radar (non-pulsed; used for navigation systems)
Weather radar (pulsed with Doppler processing)
Continuous-wave radar (non-pulsed, pure Doppler processing)
Fm-cw radar (non-pulsed, swept frequency, range and Doppler processing)
Aliasing - the reason for ambiguous velocity estimates
Doppler sonography - velocity measurements in medical ultrasound. Based on the same principle
