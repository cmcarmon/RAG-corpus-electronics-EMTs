Some projects need more DC current or higher DC voltages than batteries 
can easily provide. In those cases, you can use an AC adapter, such as the 
one shown in Figure 12-6, to convert AC to DC and get the higher current or 
voltage you need. All the working parts are self‐contained in the wall trans-
former, so you aren’t exposed to high AC currents.
