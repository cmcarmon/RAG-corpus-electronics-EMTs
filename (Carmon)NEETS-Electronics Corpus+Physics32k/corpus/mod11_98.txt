maximum bunching to take useful energy from the beam (shown in figure 2-6B). The physical position of 
the catcher cavity is determined by the frequency of the buncher-grid signal because this signal 
determines the transit time of the electron bunches. Note also that both cavities are resonant at the 
buncher-grid frequency. The electron bunches will induce an rf voltage in the grid gap of the second 
cavity causing it to oscillate. Proper placement of the second cavity will cause the induced grid-gap 
voltage to decelerate the electron bunches as they arrive at the gap. Since the largest concentration of 
electrons is in the bunches, slowing the bunches causes a transfer of energy to the output cavity. The 
balance of energy has been disturbed because the placement of the catcher cavity is such that bunches are 
slowed down when they arrive at the cavity. The areas between bunches arrive at the cavity at just the 
right time. At this time the voltage is of the correct polarity to increase the velocity of the electrons and 
the beam absorbs energy. The areas between the bunches have very few electrons, so the energy removed 
from the beam is much greater than the energy required to speed up the electrons between the bunches. 
Therefore, if the second cavity is properly positioned, useful energy can be removed from a velocity-
modulated electron beam.
