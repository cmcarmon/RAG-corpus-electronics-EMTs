Finally, an optical circulator [Fletcher and Weisman, 1965] can be designed by replacing the polarizers in a
conventional isolator conﬁguration with a pair of calcite polarizing prisms. A laser beam is directed through a
calcite prism, then through a Faraday rotator material which rotates the polarization plane by 45 degrees, then
through a second calcite prism set to pass polarization at 45 degrees. Any reﬂection beyond this second calcite
prism returns through the second prism, is rotated by another 45 degrees through the Faraday material, and,
because its polarization is now 90 degrees from the incident beam, is deﬂected by the ﬁrst calcite prism. The
four ports of the circulator then are found as follows: (1) the incident beam, (2) the exit beam, (3) the deﬂected
beam from the ﬁrst calcite prism, and (4) the deﬂected beam from the second calcite prism.
