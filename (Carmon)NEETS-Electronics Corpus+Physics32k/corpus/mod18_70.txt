The antenna-rotation rate also affects maximum detection range. The slower an antenna rotates, the
greater the detection range of a radar system. When the antenna is rotated at 10 revolutions per minute
(rpm), the beam of energy strikes each target for just one-half the time it would if the rotation were 5 rpm.
