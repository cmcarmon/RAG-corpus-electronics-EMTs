Other autoloading systems are:
Blow forward firearms lack the use of a bolt but instead a moving barrel that gets dragged forward by the bullet until it leaves the barrel to cycle its action.
Blowback firearms use the expanding gas impinging on the cartridge itself to push the bolt of the firearm rearward.
Gas-operated firearms tap off a small amount of the expanding gas to power the moving parts of the action.
