Today’s VRMs are powered up from the 5-V or 12-V
outputs of silver boxes that are used for supplying various
parts of the system, such as the memory chips, the video
cards, and some sub buses. Future VRMs will be required to
provide lower voltages and higher currents with tighter volt-
age regulations. The traditional centralized power system, the
silver box, will no longer meet the stringent requirements for
VRM voltage regulation because of the distributed impedance
associated with a long power bus and the parasitic ringing
due to high-frequency operation. On the other hand, with
much heavier loads in the future, the bus loss becomes
signiﬁcant. To maintain system stability, a huge silverbox
output capacitance is also needed. At the same time, to
avoid the interaction between different outputs, a very large
VRM input ﬁlter capacitance is required. Figure 1.2 shows the
trend of computer power system architecture. In the future, a
distributed power system (DPS) with a high-voltage bus, 12 V
