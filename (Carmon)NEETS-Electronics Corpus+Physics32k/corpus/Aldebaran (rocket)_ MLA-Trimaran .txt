Dassault Aviation configuration, also known as MLA-Trimaran, or simply MLA, was a 3-stage rocket composed of core stage under the fighter fuselage and two connected boosters under the wings. With a launcher mass close to the maximum capacity of Dassault Rafale it could lift up to 150 kg into LEO.
Typical mission profile would include fighter lifting the rocket up to 12 km at a speed of Mach 0.7 pulling up to release MLA at an optimum angle. 4 seconds after the separations boosters would ignite accelerating rocket to 6.5 Mach at 36 km altitude in 42 seconds. After boosters separation 2nd stage would ignite achieving velocity of 4.5 km/s at the altitude of 78.5 km. Following fairing separation and 3rd stage ignition rocket would achieve transfer orbit 359 seconds into the flight at the altitude of 250 km at speed of 7.9 km/s shutting down for a ballistic phase. Circulation would be completed at a final 800 km orbit.
Many aspects of the proposition have been completed including deep studies on possible critical aspects such as stability, interaction with the aircraft or separation phases with no stoppers identified. Fighter flight qualities are similar to these with three external 2000 liter fuel tanks.
