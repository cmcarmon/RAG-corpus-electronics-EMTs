The second identiﬁcation target of this discussion is a three-
story steel structure model, with an active mass driver (AMD)
installed on the third ﬂoor to reduce the vibration of the
structure due to simulated earthquakes. A picture of the
system is given in Figure 6.5. This system has been used
recently as the ASCE ﬁrst-generation seismic-AMD bench-
mark study. The benchmark structure has two input excita-
tions: the voltage command sent to the AMD by the control
computer and the ground acceleration generated by a seismic
shaker. The system responses are measured by four accelerom-
eters for the three ﬂoors and the AMD and one linear variable
differential
transformer (LVDT) for the displacement of
the AMD. The sampling rate is 256 Hz, and the frequency
resolution is 0.0625 Hz. Due to noise and nonlinearity,
only the frequency range of 3 to 35 Hz of the FRF data is
considered to be accurate and, thus, this range is used for the
identiﬁcation.
