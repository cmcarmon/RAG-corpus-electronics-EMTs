Electronic Goldmine sells new and surplus parts, from the lowly resistor to 
exotic lasers. Its website is organized by category, which makes ordering 
easy. (One category, labeled “Rare and Esoteric,” may be where Doc Brown 
got the flux capacitor that made time travel possible in Back to the Future.) 
Listings for most parts include a color picture and a short description. Be 
sure to check out the nice selection of project kits.
