• The ability to measure “inaccessible” voltages and currents. Because a mathematical model is used all
voltages  and  currents  are  available.  No  loading  problems  are  associated  with  placing  a  voltmeter  or
oscilloscope  in  the  middle  of  the  circuit,  with  measuring  difﬁcult  one-shot  wave  forms,  or  probing  a
microscopic die.
