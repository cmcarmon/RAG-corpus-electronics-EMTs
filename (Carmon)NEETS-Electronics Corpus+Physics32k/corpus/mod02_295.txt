When an alternating voltage is impressed across a capacitor, power is taken from the source and 
stored in the capacitor as the voltage increases from zero to its maximum value. Then, as the impressed 
voltage decreases from its maximum value to zero, the capacitor discharges and returns the power to the 
source. Likewise, as the current through an inductor increases from its zero value to its maximum value 
the field around the inductor builds up to a maximum, and when the current decreases from maximum to 
zero the field collapses and returns the power to the source. You can see therefore that no power is used 
up in either case, since the power alternately flows to and from the source. This power that is returned to 
the source by the reactive components in the circuit is called REACTIVE POWER.
