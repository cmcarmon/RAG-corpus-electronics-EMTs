In the radar portion of the rf spectrum, external sources of noise interference are usually negligible;
consequently, the sensitivity that can be achieved in a radar receiver is usually determined by the noise
produced in the receiver. Not only must noise be kept down, but everything possible must be done to
minimize attenuation of the video signal (echo) before it is amplified.
