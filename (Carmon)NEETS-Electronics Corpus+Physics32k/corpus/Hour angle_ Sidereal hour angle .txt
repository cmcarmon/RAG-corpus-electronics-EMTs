The sidereal hour angle (SHA) of a body on the celestial sphere is its angular distance west of the vernal equinox generally measured in degrees.
An alternate definition is that SHA of a celestial body is the arc of the Equinoctial or the angle at the celestial pole contained between the celestial meridian of the First point of Aries and that through the body, measured westward from Aries.
The SHA of a star changes slowly, and the SHA of a planet doesn't change very quickly, so SHA is a convenient way to list their positions in an almanac. SHA is often used in celestial navigation and navigational astronomy.
