Just as you fill a water cooler by connecting it to a water source, you fill a 
capacitor with electrical energy by connecting it to a source of electrical 
energy. And just as water stored in a water cooler remains even after the 
source is removed, so too the electrical energy stored in a capacitor remains 
even after the source is removed. In 
each case, the stuff (water or electrical 
energy) stored in the device stays there 
until something comes along and taps 
into it — whether it’s a thirsty consumer 
or an electronic component in need of 
electrical energy.
