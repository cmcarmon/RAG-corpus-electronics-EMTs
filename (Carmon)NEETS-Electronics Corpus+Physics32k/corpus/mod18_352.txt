The MIXER stage is often called the FIRST DETECTOR. The function of this stage is to convert the
received rf energy to a lower, intermediate frequency (IF) that is easier to amplify and manipulate
electronically. The intermediate frequency is usually 30 or 60 megahertz. It is obtained by heterodyning
the received signal with a local-oscillator signal in the mixer stage. The mixer stage converts the received
signal to the lower IF signal without distorting the data on the received signal.
