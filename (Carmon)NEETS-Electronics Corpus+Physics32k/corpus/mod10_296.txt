The SKIP ZONE is a zone of silence between the point where the ground wave becomes too weak 
for reception and the point where the sky wave is first returned to Earth. The size of the skip zone 
depends on the extent of the ground wave coverage and the skip distance. When the ground wave 
coverage is great enough or the skip distance is short enough that no zone of silence occurs, there is no 
skip zone.
