(b) Instead of truncating the series, let’s generalize the nature of the approximation to including any set of
2K + 1 terms: We’ll always include the c0 and the negative indexed term corresponding to ck. What
selection of terms minimizes the mean-squared error? Find an expression for the mean-squared error
resulting from your choice.
