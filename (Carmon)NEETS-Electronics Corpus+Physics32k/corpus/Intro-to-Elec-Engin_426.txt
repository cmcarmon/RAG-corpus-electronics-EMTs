When there is a common-mode input voltage, i.e., when the input signals are equal and greater
than zero, the output voltage of an ideal op amp is zero because vd is equal to zero. In general, the
/2; and the difference signal vd = vp − vn is to be
common-mode input vC is deﬁned as
ampliﬁed. Common-mode gain AC is deﬁned as the ratio vo/vC when vd = 0. The common-mode
rejection ratio (CMRR) is deﬁned by A/AC, but is usually expressed in units of decibel (dB),
