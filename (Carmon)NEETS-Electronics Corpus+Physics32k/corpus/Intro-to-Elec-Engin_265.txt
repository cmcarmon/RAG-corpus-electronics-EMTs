(3.3.3)
in which A and B are independent of s and t, and F1(s) and F2(s) are the Laplace transforms of f1(t )
and f2(t ), respectively. Using the deÔ¨Ånition of Equation (3.3.1), Table 3.3.1 of Laplace transform
pairs is developed for the most commonly encountered functions. Note that it is assumed that
