Simplifying gates with truth tables
Tracking all the 0 and 1 inputs to logic gates and the outputs they produce 
can get a bit confusing — especially for gates with more than two inputs — 
so designers use a tool called a truth table to keep things organized. This 
table lists all the possible combinations of inputs and corresponding outputs 
for a given logical function.
