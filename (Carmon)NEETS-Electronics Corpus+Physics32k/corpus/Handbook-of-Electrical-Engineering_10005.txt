Therefore,  for  a  limit  cycle  in  the  system  of  Fig.  100.42,  errors  in  the  DF  method  relate  to  its  inability  to
predict a phase shift, which the fundamental harmonic may experience in passing through the nonlinearity,
rather than an incorrect magnitude of the gain. When the input to a single-valued nonlinearity is a sinusoid
together with some of its harmonics, the fundamental output is not necessarily in phase with the fundamental
