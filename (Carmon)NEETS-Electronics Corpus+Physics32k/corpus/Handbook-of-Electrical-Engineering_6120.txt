A transient stability program can be extended to include induction machines which are associated with many
of the voltage collapse problems. In these studies, it is the stability of the motors that are examined rather than
the stability of the synchronous machines. The asynchronous nature of the induction machine means that rotor
angle  is  not  a  concern,  but  instead  the  capability  of  the  machines  to  recover  after  a  fault  has  depressed  the
voltage  and  allowed  the  machines  to  slow  down.  The  re-accelerating  machines  draw  more  reactive  current
which can hold the terminal voltage down below that necessary to allow recovery. Similarly starting a machine
will depress the voltage which affects other induction machines which further lowers the voltage.
