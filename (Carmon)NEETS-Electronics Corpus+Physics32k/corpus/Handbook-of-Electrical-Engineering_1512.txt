Speaker Adaptation
In spite of recent progress in the design of speaker-independent (SI) systems, error rates are still typically two
or  three  times  higher  than  equivalent  speaker-dependent  (SD)  systems.  Variability  in  both  anatomical  and
personal characteristics contribute to this effect. Anatomical differences include the length of the vocal tract,
the size of the nasal cavity, etc. Similarly, there are variable speaking habits, such as accent, speed, and loudness.
The straight-forward approach which blindly mixes the statistics for all speakers discards useful information.
The large amount of speaker-speciﬁc data required to train SD systems renders them impractical for many
applications. However, it is possible to use a small amount of the new speaker’s speech (adaptation data) to
“tune”  the  SI  models  to  the  new  speaker.  Ideally,  we  would  like  to  retain  the  robustness  of  well-trained  SI
models, yet improve the appropriateness of the models for the new speaker. Such methods are called speaker
adaptation techniques. The adaptation is said to be supervised if the true text transcript of the adaptation data
is known; otherwise, the adaption is said to be unsupervised.
