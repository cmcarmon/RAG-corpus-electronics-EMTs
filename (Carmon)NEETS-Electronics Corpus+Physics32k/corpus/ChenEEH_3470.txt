current differential scheme provides the restraint winding con-
nection to each circuit that is a major source of the fault
current. These schemes are designed to restrain correctly for
heavy faults just outside the differential zone, with maximum
offset current, as long as the CTs do not saturate for the
maximum symmetrical current. These schemes are more difﬁ-
cult to apply and require use of auxiliary CTs to match the
current transformer ratios. The high-impedance voltage differ-
ential principle uses a property that CTs, when loaded with
high impedance, will be forced to take the error differential
current, and, hence, this current will not ﬂow through the relay
operating coil. This principle translates the current differential
sensitivity problem is to the voltage differential sensitivity prob-
em for distinguishing the close-in faults from the bus faults.
The voltage differential scheme is easier to implement since the
worst case voltage for external faults can be determined much
more precisely knowing the open voltage of the CT.
