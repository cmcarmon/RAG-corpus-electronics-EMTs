In this model the lattice takes the form of a two-dimensional square grid, with particles capable of moving to any of the four adjacent grid points which share a common edge, and particles cannot move diagonally. This means each grid point can only have one of sixteen possible interactions.
Particles exist only on the grid points, never on the edges or surface of the lattice.
Each particle has an associated direction (from one grid point to another immediately adjacent grid point).
Each lattice grid cell can only contain a maximum of one particle for each direction, i.e., contain a total of between zero and four particles.
The following rules also govern the model:
A single particle moves in a fixed direction until it experiences a collision.
Two particles experiencing a head-on collision are deflected perpendicularly.
Two particles experience a collision which isn't head-on simply pass through each other and continue in the same direction.
Optionally, when a particles collides with the edges of a lattice it can rebound.
The HPP models follows a two-stage update process.
