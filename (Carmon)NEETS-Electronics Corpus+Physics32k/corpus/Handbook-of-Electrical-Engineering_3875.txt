edges, or a compound design of sectoral and pyramidal combined. For all antennas, the relevant design and
analysis will depend on antenna aperture size and shape, the center wavelength l, and the distance from the
aperture  to  a  point  of  interest  (the  range,  R).  This  section  covers  discrete  oscillators,  arrays  of  oscillators,
synthetic apertures, geometric design, Fourier analysis, and parameters of some typical antennas. The emphasis
is on microwave-type designs.
