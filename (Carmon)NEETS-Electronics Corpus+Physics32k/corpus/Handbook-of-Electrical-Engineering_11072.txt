This  section  has  focused  only  on  the  three  most  prominent  bioelectric  events,  those  of  the  heart,  skeletal
muscle, and brain. The eye, ear, sweat glands, and many types of smooth muscle produce action potentials that
are used for their diagnostic value, as well as being the subject of on-going research. The reader interested in
delving deeper into this ﬁeld can ﬁnd such information in a book by Geddes and Baker [1989].
