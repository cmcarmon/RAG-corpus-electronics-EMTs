In the functional program, N is decremented each time SUM is recursively called. Suppose N = 10, initially;
then SUM is called 10 times. When N > 0 is false, the SUM routine does nothing, thus terminating the recursion.
Interestingly, the additions are not performed until the Ô¨Ånal attempt to recurse fails. That is, when N = 0, the
following sums are collected as the nested calls unwind:
