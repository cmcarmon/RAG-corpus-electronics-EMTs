This operating procedure should be contrasted with the traditional engineering design, made of exhaustive
subsystem speciﬁcations and intercommunication protocols. In ANNs, the designer chooses the network topol-
ogy, the performance function, the learning rule, and the criterion to stop the training phase, but the system
 information into the design, and when
automatically adjusts the parameters. So, it is difﬁcult to bring 
the system does not work properly it is also hard to incrementally reﬁne the solution. But ANN-based solutions
are  extremely  efﬁcient  in  terms  of  development  time  and  resources,  and  in  many  difﬁcult  problems  ANNs
provide performance that is difﬁcult to match with other technologies. Denker 10 years ago said that “ANNs
are the second best way to implement a solution” motivated by the simplicity of their design and because of
their universality, only shadowed by the traditional design obtained by studying the physics of the problem. At
present, ANNs are emerging as the technology of choice for many applications, such as pattern recognition,
prediction, system identiﬁcation, and control.
