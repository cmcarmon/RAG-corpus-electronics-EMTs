pipe back to the pond, stored energy in the reservoir cannot be released in the form of water
ﬂow. Once the reservoir is completely ﬁlled up, no ﬂow can occur, no matter how much pressure
the pump may generate. There needs to be a complete path (circuit) for water to ﬂow from the
pond, to the reservoir, and back to the pond in order for continuous ﬂow to occur.
