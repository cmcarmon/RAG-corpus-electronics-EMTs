If




G



{\displaystyle \mathrm {G} }
is a semisimple algebraic group over a number field



F


{\displaystyle F}
and




A



{\displaystyle \mathbb {A} }
its adèle ring then the group



G
=

G

(

A

)


{\displaystyle G=\mathrm {G} (\mathbb {A} )}
of adélic points is well-defined (modulo some technicalities) and it is a locally compact group which naturally contains the group




G

(
F
)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {G} (F)}
of



F


{\displaystyle F}
-rational point as a discrete subgroup. The Borel–Harish-Chandra theorem extends to this setting, and




G

(
F
)
⊂

G

(

A

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {G} (F)\subset \mathrm {G} (\mathbb {A} )}
is a lattice.
The strong approximation theorem relates the quotient




G

(
F
)
∖

G

(

A

)


{\displaystyle \mathrm {G} (F)\backslash \mathrm {G} (\mathbb {A} )}
to more classical S-arithmetic quotients. This fact makes the adèle groups very effective as tools in the theory of automorphic forms. In particular modern forms of the trace formula are usually stated and proven for adélic groups rather than for Lie groups.
