Frequency Allocations
The carrier frequencies for standard broadcasting in the United States (referred to internationally as medium-
wave broadcasting) are designated in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Rules and Regulations,
Vol. III, Part 73. A total of 117 carrier frequencies are allocated from 540 to 1700 kHz in 10-kHz intervals. Each
carrier frequency is required by the FCC rules to deviate no more than â€“20 Hz from the allocated frequency,
to  minimize  heterodyning  from  two  or  more  interfering  stations.  Double-sideband  full-carrier  modulation,
commonly called amplitude modulation (AM), is used in standard broadcasting for sound transmission. Typical
modulation frequencies for voice and music range from 50 Hz to 10 kHz. Each channel is generally thought
of as 10 kHz in width, and thus the frequency band is designated from 535 to 1705 kHz; however, when the
modulation  frequency  exceeds  5 kHz,  the  radio  frequency  bandwidth  of  the  channel  exceeds  10 kHz  and
