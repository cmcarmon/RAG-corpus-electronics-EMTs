One important application of quantum trajectories is reducing the computational resources required to simulate a master equation. For a Hilbert space of dimension d, the amount of real numbers required to store the density matrix is of order d2, and the time required to compute the master equation evolution is of order d4. Storing the state vector for a SSE, on the other hand, only requires an amount of real numbers of order d, and the time to compute trajectory evolution is only of order d2. The master equation evolution can then be approximated by averaging over many individual trajectories simulated using the SSE, a technique sometimes referred to as the Monte Carlo wave-function approach. Although the number of calculated trajectories n must be very large in order to accurately approximate the master equation, good results can be obtained for trajectory counts much less than d2. Not only does this technique yield faster computation time, but it also allows for the simulation of master equations on machines that do not have enough memory to store the entire density matrix.
