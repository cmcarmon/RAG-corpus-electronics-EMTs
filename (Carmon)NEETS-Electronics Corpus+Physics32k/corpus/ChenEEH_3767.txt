observation probabilities, the methods developed for the dis-
crete-observation case can be applied directly. The resulting
measure computed for a model, say M, and an observation
string, say y¼def
{y1, . . ., yT }, will be P(yjM) for the F–B
approach and P(y, I minjM) in the Viterbi case. These meas-
ures will no longer be proper probabilities, but they provide
meaningful likelihood measures with which appropriate rela-
tive comparisons across models can be made.
