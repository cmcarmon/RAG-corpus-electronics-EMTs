The voltage range of wattmeters is generally limited to several hundred volts because of heat 
dissipation within the voltage circuit. However, the voltage range can be extended by using external 
voltage dividers. Wattmeters used as laboratory standards have an accuracy of 0.1%, high-grade portable 
wattmeters an accuracy of 0.2% to 0.25%, and high-grade switchboard wattmeters an accuracy of 1% of
