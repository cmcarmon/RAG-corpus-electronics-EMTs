A computer spreadsheet is a software program used 
for inputting, manipulating, organizing, and storing 
data, which are placed in cells. Each cell is identified by 
a grid placement with letters across the top to identify 
columns and numbers down the left side to identify 
rows. The cells are identified by column and row desig-
nation such as A1, B12, ZZ123, and so on. These cells 
can contain numbers, formulas, and text. Functions are 
built-in formulas that are used for common tasks.
