measured by resonant, cavity-type wavemeters or resonant, coaxial-line-type wavemeters. When properly
calibrated, resonant-cavity and resonant-coaxial line wavemeters are more accurate and have better
stability than wavemeters used for measurements in the LF to VHF ranges. These frequency-measuring
instruments are often furnished as part of the equipment. They are also available as general-purpose test
sets.
