The moving-vane meter movement (sometimes called the moving-iron movement) is the most
commonly used movement for ac meters. The moving-vane meter operates on the principle of magnetic
repulsion between like poles (fig.1-16). The current to be measured flows through a coil, producing a
magnetic field which is proportional to the strength of the current. Suspended in this field are two iron
vanes. One is in a fixed position, the other, attached to the meter pointer, is movable. The magnetic field
magnetizes these iron vanes with the same polarity regardless of the direction of current flow in the coil.
Since like poles repel, the movable vane pulls away from the fixed vane, moving the meter pointer. This
motion exerts a turning force against the spring. The distance the vane will move against the force of the
spring depends on the strength of the magnetic field, which in turn depends on the coil current.
