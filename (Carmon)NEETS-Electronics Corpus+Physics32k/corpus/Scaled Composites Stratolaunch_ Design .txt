It has a twin-fuselage configuration, each 238 ft (73 m) long and supported by 12 main landing gear wheels and two nose gear wheels, for a total of 28 wheels. The twin-fuselage configuration is similar to the Scaled Composites White Knight Two. Each fuselage has its own empennage with horizontal and vertical stabilizers, leaving a clear area behind the payload to reduce the risk of interference during flight.
The pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer will be in the right fuselage cockpit, while the left fuselage one is empty and unpressurized. The flight data systems are in the left fuselage.
At 385 ft (117 m), it is the largest plane by wingspan, to be compared to a 360 ft (110 m) American football field. The centre section of the high-mounted, high aspect ratio wing is fitted with a Mating and Integration System (MIS) capable of handling a 500,000 lb (230 t) load, being developed by Dynetics.
It is powered by six Pratt & Whitney PW4056 engines positioned on pylons outboard of each fuselage, 56,750 lbf (252.4 kN) each. To cut development costs, many of the aircraft systems have been adopted from the Boeing 747-400, including the engines, avionics, flight deck, landing gear and other systems.
It will require 12,000 ft (3,700 m) of runway to lift-off. It should release its rocket at 35,000 ft (11,000 m). It will carry a 550,000 lb (250 t) payload. With a Pegasus II, it could have delivered up to 13,500 lb (6.1 t) satellites to LEO or 4,500 lb (2.0 t) to a 15Â° GTO. It could have launched a Dream Chaser small space shuttle capable of return astronauts or payloads within 24 hours.
Within Scaled Composites, its model number is M351. It is nicknamed "Roc" after Sinbad's Roc, the mythical bird so big it could carry an elephant.
