Operational  amplifiers  are  analogue 
integrated 
circuits designed for linear amplification that offer 
near-ideal  characteristics  (virtually  infinite  voltage 
gain  and  input  resistance  coupled  with  low  output 
resistance and wide bandwidth). 
  Operational  amplifiers  can  be  thought  of  as 
universal 
external 
components  are  added  in  order  to  define  their 
function  within  a  circuit.  By  adding  two  resistors, 
we  can  produce  an  amplifier  having  a  precisely 
defined  gain.  Alternatively,  with  two  resistors  and 
two capacitors we can produce a simple band-pass 
filter.  From  this  you  might  begin  to  suspect  that 
operational  amplifiers  are  really  easy  to  use.  The 
good news is that they are!
