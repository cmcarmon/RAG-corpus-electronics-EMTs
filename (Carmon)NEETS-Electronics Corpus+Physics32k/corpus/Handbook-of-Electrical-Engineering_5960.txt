A  permanent  split  capacitor  motor  uses  the  same  capacitor  throughout  the  speed  range  of  the  motor.  Its
value  requires  a  compromise  between  the  values  of  the  two-capacitor  motors.  The  result  is  a  motor  design
optimized for a particular application, e.g., a compressor or a fan. Figure 66.22 shows schematically the wiring
diagram of the permanent split capacitor motor.
