The Xinjiang Time (Chinese: 新疆时间; pinyin: Xīnjiāng shíjiān), or known as Ürümqi Time (Chinese: 乌鲁木齐时间; pinyin: Wūlǔmùqí Shíjiān), is set due to its geographical location in the westernmost part of China. The time offset is UTC+06:00 which is two hours behind Beijing, and is shared with Kyrgyzstan and most of Kazakhstan. It is one of the two time standards, together with Beijing Time, being used in parallel in Xinjiang, China.
