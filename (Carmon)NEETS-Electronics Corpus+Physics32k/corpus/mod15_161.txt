The data to be transmitted is another important factor that we must consider when we discuss the 
accuracy of a synchro system. If this data covers a wide range of values, the basic synchro system is 
unable to detect any small changes in the data. When this happens, the accuracy of the system decreases. 
Because of this difficulty, multispeed synchro systems were developed. They handle this type of data very 
effectively and still maintain a high degree of accuracy.
