After a disturbance, due usually to a network fault, the synchronous machineâ€™s electrical loading changes and
the  machines  speed  up  (under  very  light  loading  conditions  they  can  slow  down).  Each  machine  will  react
differently depending on its proximity to the fault, its initial loading and its time constants. This means that
the angular positions of the rotors relative to each other change. If any angle exceeds a certain threshold (usually
(cid:176)
(cid:176)
between 140
 and 160
) the machine will no longer be able to maintain synchronism. This almost always results
in its removal from service.
