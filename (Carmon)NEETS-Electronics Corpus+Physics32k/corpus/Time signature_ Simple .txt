Simple time signatures consist of two numerals, one stacked above the other:
The upper numeral indicates how many such beats constitute a bar.
The lower numeral indicates the note value that represents one beat (the beat unit).
For instance, 24 means two quarter-note (crotchet) beats per bar, while 38 means three eighth-note (quaver) beats per bar. The most common simple time signatures are 24, 34, and 44.
By convention, two special symbols are sometimes used for 44 and 22:
The symbol  is sometimes used for 44 time, also called common time or imperfect time. The symbol is derived from a broken circle used in music notation from the 14th through 16th centuries, where a full circle represented what today would be written in 32 or 34 time, and was called tempus perfectum (perfect time). See Mensural time signatures below.
The symbol  is also a carry-over from the notational practice of late-Medieval and Renaissance music, where it signified tempus imperfectum diminutum (diminished imperfect time)â€”more precisely, a doubling of the speed, or proportio dupla, in duple meter. In modern notation, it is used in place of 22 and is called alla breve or, colloquially, cut time or cut common time.
