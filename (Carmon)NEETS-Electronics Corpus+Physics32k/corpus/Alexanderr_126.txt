The third step in nodal analysis is to solve for the node voltages.
If we apply KCL to 
simul-
taneous  equations  such  as  Eqs.  (3.5)  and  (3.6)  or  (3.7)  and  (3.8).  For
the circuit of Fig. 3.2, we solve Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8)
to obtain the node voltages 
using any standard method, such
as  the  substitution  method,  the  elimination  method,  Cramer’s  rule,  or
matrix inversion. To use either of the last two methods, one must cast
the simultaneous equations in matrix form. For example, Eqs. (3.7) and
(3.8) can be cast in matrix form as
