France experimented in 2000 a sharp cut of legal or statutory working time of the employees in the private and public sector from 39 hours a week to 35 hours a week, with the stated goal to fight against rampant unemployment at that time. The Law 2000-37 on working time reduction is also referred to as the Aubry Law, according to the name of the Labor Minister at that time. Employees can (and do) work more than 35 hours a week, yet in this case firms must pay them overtime bonuses. If the bonus is determined through collective negotiations, it cannot be lower than 10%. If no agreement on working time is signed, the legal bonus must be of 25% for the first 8 hours, than goes up to 50% for the rest. Including overtime, the maximum working time cannot exceed 48 hours per week, and should not exceed 44 hours per week over 12 weeks in a row. Interestingly, in France the labor law also regulates the minimum working hours: part time jobs should not allow for less than 24 hours per week without a branch collective agreement. These agreements can allow for less, under tight conditions. According to the official statistics (DARES) , after the introduction of the law on working time reduction, actual hours per week performed by full time employed, fell from 39.6 hours in 1999, to a trough of 37.7 hours in 2002, then gradually went back to 39.1 hours in 2005. In 2016 working hours were of 39.1. It seems that the cut in legal hours translated essentially into more overtime hours. Seventeen year later, and after two major crises, unemployment rate in France is more than twice the unemployment rate in Germany.
