MOV devices are made primarily of zinc oxide 
with small amounts of bismuth, cobalt, manganese, 
and other metal oxides. They can be connected in par-
allel for increased energy-handling capabilities. They 
can also be connected in series to provide higher volt-
age ratings or to provide voltage ratings between the 
standard increments.
