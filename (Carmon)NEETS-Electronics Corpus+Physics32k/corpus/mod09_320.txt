A sinusoidal (sine-wave) oscillator is one that will produce output pulses at a predetermined 
frequency for an indefinite period of time; that is, it operates continuously. Many electronic circuits in 
equipment such as radar require that an oscillator be turned on for a specific period of time and that it 
remain in an off condition until required at a later time. These circuits are referred to as PULSED 
OSCILLATORS or RINGING OSCILLATORS. They are nothing more than sine-wave oscillators that 
are turned on and off at specific times.
