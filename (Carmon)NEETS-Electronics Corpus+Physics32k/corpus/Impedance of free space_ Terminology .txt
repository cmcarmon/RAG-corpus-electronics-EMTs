The analogous quantity for a plane wave travelling through a dielectric medium is called the intrinsic impedance of the medium, and designated η (eta). Hence Z0 is sometimes referred to as the intrinsic impedance of free space, and given the symbol η0. It has numerous other synonyms, including:
wave impedance of free space,
the vacuum impedance,
intrinsic impedance of vacuum,
characteristic impedance of vacuum,
wave resistance of free space.
