Figure 4-2 shows the relationship between the tape reeling system and the tape buffering system. As 
you can see, the speed at which a tape reel will give up or take up magnetic tape is controlled by its 
respective speed control servo. Feedback from the supply and take-up buffers tells the servo to speed up 
or slow down.
