One of the problems brieﬂy mentioned previously is the large number of pixels needed to represent an image,
512 image with
which translates into a large amount of digital data needed for the representation. A 512 
8 bits/pixel (1 byte/pixel) of gray level representation requires 2,097,152 bits of computer data to describe it. A

typical computer ﬁle that contains 1000 words usually requires only about 56,000 bits to describe it. The 512 
512 image is 37 times larger! (A picture is truly worth more than 1000 words.) This data requirement is one
of the major problems with digital imaging, given that the storage of digital images in a computer ﬁle system
is expensive. Perhaps another example will demonstrate this problem. Many computers and word processing
systems have the capability of transmitting information over telephone lines to other systems at data rates of
512 image! Moving
2400 bits per second. At this speed it would require nearly 15 minutes to transmit a 512 
 of them, i.e., digital video. True digital imaging would
objects are imaged digitally by taking 
acquire  about  30  images/s  to  capture  all  the  important  motion  in  a  scene. At  30  images/s,  with  each  image
512  and  with  8  bits/pixel,  the  system  must  handle  62,914,560  bits/s.  Only  very  expensive
sampled  at  512 
acquisition systems are capable of handling these large data rates.
