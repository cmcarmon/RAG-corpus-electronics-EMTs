Many  engineers  were  skeptical  as  to  whether  early  computers  would  operate  sufÔ¨Åciently  long  before  a
breakdown would prevent the production of useful results. Little recognition has been given to the pioneers of
component and circuit reliability that have made digital systems virtually, but still not totally, fault-free. Critical
systems, whether in medicine or national defense, must operate even if components and subsystems fail. The
next chapter reviews the techniques employed to make computer systems fault-tolerant.
