VERY-LOW-FREQUENCY (vlf) transmissions provide a highly reliable path for communications 
in these northern latitudes as well as over and under all oceans and seas of the world. At present, 
practically all Navy vlf transmitters are used for fleet communications or navigation. The vlf transmission 
is normally considered a broadcast, that is, one-way transmission, no reply required. The vlf transmitter 
normally transmits single-channel rtty.
