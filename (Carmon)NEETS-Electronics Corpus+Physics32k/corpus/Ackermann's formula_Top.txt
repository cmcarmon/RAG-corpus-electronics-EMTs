Ackermann's formula is a control system design method for solving the pole allocation problem. One of the primary problems in control system design is the creation of controllers that will alter the dynamics of a system and alter the poles to a more suitable, and sometimes more stable, state. Such a problem can be tackled by many different methods; one such solution is the addition of a feedback loop in such a way that a gain is added to the input with which one can change the poles of the original system. If the system is controllable, an efficient method for pole placement is Ackermann's formula, which allows one to choose arbitrary poles within the system.
