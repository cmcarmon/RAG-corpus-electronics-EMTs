Let us now consider the case where S1 is opened and S2 is kept closed only for a
short amount of time. This case starts out just like the previous case. In other words,
at the instant that S1 is opened and S2 is closed, the inductor has a current equal to
V/R flowing through it. Since the current flowing through the inductor cannot change
instantaneously, the same current will flow into the capacitor through the closed switch
S2. As the capacitor charges, its voltage rises past V (again, assuming a small enough
capacitor, or a large enough initial voltage on the capacitor).
