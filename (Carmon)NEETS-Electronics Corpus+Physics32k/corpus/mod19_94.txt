To be effective, a tourniquet must be tight enough to stop the blood flowing to the limb. If the 
pressure from the tourniquet is less than the arterial pressure, arterial bleeding will continue. Also, 
insufficient tourniquet pressure may actually increase the amount of bleeding from the veins. So be sure 
to draw the tourniquet tight enough to stop the bleeding. However, do not make it any tighter than 
necessary.
