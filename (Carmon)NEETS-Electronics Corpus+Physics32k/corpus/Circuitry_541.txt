Figure  11.11  shows  the  arrangement  of  a  typical 
microcontroller  system.  The  sensed  quantities 
(temperature,  position,  etc.)  are  converted 
to 
corresponding  electrical  signals  by  means  of  a 
number of sensors. The outputs from the sensors (in 
either digital or analogue form) are passed as input 
signals to the microcontroller. The microcontroller 
also  accepts  inputs  from  the  user.  These  user  set 
options typically include target values for variables 
(such  as  desired  room  temperature),  limit  values 
(such as maximum shaft speed), or time constraints 
(such as ‘on’ time and ‘off’ time, delay time, etc). 
  The  operation  of 
is 
controlled  by  a  sequence  of  software  instructions 
known as a control program. The control program 
operates  continuously,  examining 
inputs  from 
sensors, user settings, and time data before making 
changes  to  the  output  signals  sent  to  one  or  more 
controlled devices. 
  The  controlled  quantities  are  produced  by  the 
controlled  devices  in  response  to  output  signals 
from  the  microcontroller.  The  controlled  device 
generally  converts  energy  from  one  form  into 
energy in another form. For example, the controlled 
device  might  be  an  electrical  heater  that  converts 
electrical  energy  from  the  AC  mains  supply  into 
heat  energy  thus  producing  a  given  temperature 
(the controlled quantity). 
 
In most real-world systems there is a requirement 
for  the  system  to  be  automatic  or  self-regulating. 
Once  set,  such  systems  will  continue  to  operate
