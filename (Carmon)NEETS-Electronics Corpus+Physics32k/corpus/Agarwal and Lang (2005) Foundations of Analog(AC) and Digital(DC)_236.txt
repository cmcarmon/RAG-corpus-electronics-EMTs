As with analog signals, discrete signals can provided both native and non-native
signal representations. The discrete binary values of 0 and 1 are a native repre-
sentation for logic because they correspond naturally to the logical TRUE and
FALSE values. Non-native signal representations can be derived from discrete
signals by using sequences of digits having the value 0 or 1 to encode numbers
whose values correspond to signal values of interest. Chapter 5 covers this topic
in greater detail.
