Metabolic flux analysis is an experimental fluxomics technique used to examine production and consumption rates of metabolites in a biological system. Employing stoichiometric models of metabolism and mass spectrometry methods with isotopic mass resolution, the transfer of moieties containing isotopic tracers from one metabolite into another can be elucidated, and information about the metabolic network thus derived.
Metabolic flux analysis may use 13C to determine pathway fluxes.
See Isotopic labeling for a brief treatment of stable isotope labeling.
