The waveform in view (B) is no longer identical to that of view (A) and the nonlinear impedance 
network has generated HARMONIC FREQUENCIES. The waveform now consists of the fundamental 
frequency and its harmonics. (Harmonics were discussed in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to 
Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.)
