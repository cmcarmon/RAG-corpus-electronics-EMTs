10.11  Sketch the circuit of a bistable using: 
 
 
 
 
10.12  Sketch the symbol of each of the following 
 
 
 
 
 
10.13  With  the  aid  of  a  diagram,  explain  how  a 
three-stage binary counter can be built using 
 
 
J-K bistables. 
10.14  With  the  aid  of  a  diagram,  explain  how  a 
three-stage  shift  register  can  be  built  using 
 
 
J-K bistables. 
10.15  Identify each of the logic devices  shown in 
 
10.16  Explain, 
 
 
10.17  Figure  10.41  shows  the  internal  schematic 
for a logic device. Identify the logic family 
 
to  which  this  device  belongs  and  state  its 
 
 
logic function. 
10.18  Specify  typical  logic  levels  for  the  logic 
 
device  shown  in  Fig.  10.41.  In  relation  to 
your answer, explain the significance of the 
 
indeterminate  region  and  explain  how  this 
 
 
effects the noise margin of the device. 
10.19  Sketch the logic gate arrangement of a four 
input  majority  vote  circuit.  Using  a  truth 
 
table,  briefly  explain  the  operation  of  the 
 
 
circuit. 
10.20  Show, with the aid of a logic diagram, how 
an exclusive-OR gate can be built using only 
 
 
two-input NAND gates. 
10.21  Specify 
 
 
 
10.22  Devise a logic gate arrangement using only 
two-input NAND gates that will perform the 
 
 
same  logic  function  as  the  arrangement 
shown  in  Fig.  10.37.  Simplify  your  answer 
 
as  far  as  possible  using  the  minimum 
 
 
number of logic gates.
