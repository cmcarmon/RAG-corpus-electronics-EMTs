Types of piezoelectric motor include:
The traveling-wave motor used for auto-focus in reflex cameras
Inchworm motors for linear motion
Rectangular four-quadrant motors with high power density (2.5 W/cm3) and speed ranging from 10 nm/s to 800 mm/s.
Stepping piezo motor, using stick-slip effect.
Aside from the stepping stick-slip motor, all these motors work on the same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90Â°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage can be used to produce a high vibration amplitude.
A stick-slip motor works using the inertia of a mass and the friction of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.
