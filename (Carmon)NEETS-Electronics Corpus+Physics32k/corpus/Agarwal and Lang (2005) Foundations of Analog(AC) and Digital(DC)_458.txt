Let us illustrate node analysis applied to a circuit with a floating independent
voltage source, and hence a super node, using the circuit shown in Figure 3.21.
The circuit is the same as that shown in Figure 3.10 except that Node 2 is
now selected as the ground node, and the node voltages for Nodes 1 and 3
are defined differently. The super node containing the floating voltage source
is also marked in the figure.
