In clip-type fuseholders, the clips can be easily bent out of shape. This causes an incorrect fit, which
in time could cause an equipment malfunction. Figure 2-14 shows examples of correct and incorrect fuse
contacts for clip-type fuseholders used with knifeblade and ferrule cartridge fuses. The clips shown in the
left picture of each row have the correct contact. The three pictures on the right of each row show
incorrect contact. Notice how the clips are not contacting completely with the knifeblade or ferrules. This
incomplete contact can. cause corrosion at the contacts, which in turn can create a high resistance and
drop some of the circuit voltage at this point.
