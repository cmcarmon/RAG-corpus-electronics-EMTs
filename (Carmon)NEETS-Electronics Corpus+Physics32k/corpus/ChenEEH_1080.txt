and processes at small scales. Section 6.3 surveys the computer
and other tools that are available currently for designing,
simulating, manufacturing, packaging, and testing MEMS
devices. Having some appreciation of these key aspects of
MEMS technologies, we then review diverse applications of
MEMS structures, sensors, actuators, and systems on a chip.
One potential but uncertain use of MEMS is their employment
for information storage devices with terabit per square centi-
meter data densities, which could challenge the dominance of
magnetic storage systems.
