ICs are made by microfabrication technologies. The low cost of IC production is a result of
planar processing in which fabrication begins with a very ï¬‚at disc of silicon wafer, 5 to 10 cm in
diameter and only 0.5 mm thick. The small electronic structures to be built on it are then produced
photographically. The technique is known as photolithography, in which a photosensitive lacquer
(known as photoresist), which has the property of hardening when struck by light, is used. The
fabrication method requires a series of masks, photoetching, and diffusions.
