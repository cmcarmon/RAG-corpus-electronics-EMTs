A second optoelectronic device that conducts current when exposed to light is the 
PHOTOTRANSISTOR. A phototransistor, however, is much more sensitive to light and produces more 
output current for a given light intensity that does a photodiode. Figure 3-32 shows one type of 
phototransistor, which is made by placing a photodiode in the base circuit of an NPN transistor. Light 
falling on the photodiode changes the base current of the transistor, causing the collector current to be 
amplified. Phototransistors may also be of the PNP type, with the photodiode placed in the base-collector 
circuit.
