Future for Design for Test
Present-day trends for striving to achieve shorter time to market while at the same time meeting competitive
cost  demands  are  going  to  continue  into  the  foreseeable  future.  Design  for  testability  is  one  of  several  areas
that  manufacturers  from  IC  components  to  complete  systems  are  paying  increased  emphasis  to  in  order  to
meet their product goals. Twenty years ago some product managers considered testing as being necessary to
weed out the bad from the good but did not consider DFT to be adding value to a product. However, since
testing is essential, the value of DFT is seen in reducing the cost of an essential item. Hence DFT adds value
to a product at least by an amount equal to the savings in test costs that it brings about. Furthermore, DFT
improves time to market by making it possible to identify initial production problems at an earlier point in
time. For example, initial productions of high-performance ASIC components may contain ﬂaws that prevent
their at-speed operation under certain circumstances. If these ﬂaws are not discovered in a timely manner, they
may  turn  into  “showstopper”  issues  causing  serious  delays  in  revenue  shipments  of  products.  Whereas  no
“guaranteed” solutions exist to prevent and/or ﬁnd a solution for all types of problems, design for testability
is a rapidly maturing ﬁeld of digital design.
