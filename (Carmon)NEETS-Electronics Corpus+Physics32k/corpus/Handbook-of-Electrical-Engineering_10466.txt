system capable of operating as an open-loop or combined open-loop/closed-loop system, although that level
of complication is not explicit in the simple feedback control system shown here. In the diagram the neuro-
muscular system comprises limb, muscle, and manipulator dynamics in the forward loop and muscle spindle
and tendon organ ensembles as feedback elements. Again, many more biological sensors and other elements
are  actually  involved;  this  description  is  intended  only  to  be  generally  indicative  of  the  minimum  level  of
 All of these elements operate within the human at
