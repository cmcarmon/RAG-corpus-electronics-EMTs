The pound-force (symbol: lbf, sometimes lbf,) is a unit of force used in some systems of measurement including English Engineering units and the British Gravitational System. Pound force should not be confused with foot-pounds or pound-feet, which are units of torque, and may be written as "lbfâ‹…ft". They should not be confused with pound-mass (symbol: lb), often simply called pounds, which is a unit of mass.
