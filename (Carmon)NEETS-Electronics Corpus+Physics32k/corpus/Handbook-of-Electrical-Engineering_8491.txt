Booth recoding necessitates the internal use of 2’s complement representation in order to efﬁciently perform
subtraction of the partial products as well as additions. However, ﬂoating point standard speciﬁes sign mag-
nitude representation which is followed by most of the non-standard ﬂoating point numbers in use today. The
advantage of Booth recoding is that it generates only a half of the partial products as compared to the multiplier
implementation which does not use Booth recoding. However, the beneﬁt achieved comes at the expense of
