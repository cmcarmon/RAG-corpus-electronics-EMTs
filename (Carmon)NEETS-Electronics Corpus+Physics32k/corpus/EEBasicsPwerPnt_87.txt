Electric current (Amps) is the quantity of charge 
flowing through a section of a circuit 
Voltage may be present between two points, but 
current will only flow if there is a circuit between the 
points
A current meter (Ammeter) must be inserted in series 
(you must interrupt the circuit) 
Think of an Ammeter as a smart wire telling you how 
much current is passing through it
