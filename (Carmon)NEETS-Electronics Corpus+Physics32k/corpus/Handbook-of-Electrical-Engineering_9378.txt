Object-Oriented Programming
Object-oriented  programming  is  the  paradigm  for  designing  and  implementing  software  and  is  particularly
important in computer graphics. An engineering approach, these languages allow software to be constructed
  libraries  of  graphical
 
from  reusable,  interchangeable,  and  extensible  parts  [Cunningham  et al.,
objects are being developed. Classes of objects are deﬁned in terms of what an object can do (i.e., what actions
 actions or characteristics of
and reactions it might produce) and communicate via messages. Subclasses 
the superclass. For example, a robot could be constructed from instances of such classes as legs, arms, and head.
Each class would have actions deﬁned for it (e.g., a head would be able to nod up and down or shake from
side  to  side).  An  instance  of  a  head  in  the  object  robot  would  preserve  these  characteristics.  Representative
object-oriented languages are Smalltalk, C++, Objective-C, Actor, and Object Pascal.
