A positive displacement pump can be further classified according to the mechanism used to move the fluid:
Rotary-type positive displacement: internal gear, screw, shuttle block, flexible vane or sliding vane, circumferential piston, flexible impeller, helical twisted roots (e.g. the Wendelkolben pump) or liquid-ring pumps
Reciprocating-type positive displacement: piston pumps, plunger pumps or diaphragm pumps
Linear-type positive displacement: rope pumps and chain pumps
