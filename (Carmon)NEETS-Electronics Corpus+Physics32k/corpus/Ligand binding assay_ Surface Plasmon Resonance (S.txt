Surface Plasmon Resonance does not require labeling of the ligand. Instead, it works by measuring the change in the angle at which the polarized light is reflected from a surface (refractive index). The angle is related to the change in mass or layer of thickness, such as immobilization of a ligand changing the resonance angle, which increases the reflected light. The device for which SPR is derived includes a sensor chip, a flow cell, a light source, a prism, and a fixed angle position detector.
