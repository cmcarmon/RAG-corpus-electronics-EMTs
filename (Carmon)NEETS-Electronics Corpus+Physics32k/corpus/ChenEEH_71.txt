Norton theorem for ac circuits: A phasor circuit across a
pair of terminals is equivalent to an ideal phasor current source
Isc in parallel with an admittance YN , where Isc is the short
circuit current across the terminals and where YN is the
equivalent admittance of the circuit across the terminals.
