The preceding rules can also be used to simplify logic expressions into a
standard or canonic form. A standard form of representation makes it easy
to compare the costs of competing implementations. One canonic form that
we have seen previously in Section 5.4 is the sum-of-products form. Recall that
logic expressions in this form are represented using two levels of operations as a
set of product (AND) terms combined using the OR function. For example, the
