Another valuable lesson emerges from this example concerning the diﬀerence between cascading systems and
cascading circuits. In system theory, systems can be cascaded without changing the input-output relation
of intermediate systems. In cascading circuits, this ideal is rarely true unless the circuits are so designed.
Design is in the hands of the engineer; he or she must recognize what have come to be known as loading
eﬀects. In our simple circuit, you might think that making the resistance RL large enough would do the trick.
Because the resistors R1 and R2 can have virtually any value, you can never make the resistance of your
voltage measurement device big enough. Said another way, a circuit cannot be designed in isolation
that will work in cascade with all other circuits. Electrical engineers deal with this situation through
the notion of speciﬁcations: Under what conditions will the circuit perform as designed? Thus, you will
ﬁnd that oscilloscopes and voltmeters have their internal resistances clearly stated, enabling you to determine
whether the voltage you measure closely equals what was present before they were attached to your circuit.
Furthermore, since our resistor circuit functions as an attenuator, with the attenuation (a fancy word for
, we can
gains less than one) depending only on the ratio of the two resistor values
select any values for the two resistances we want to achieve the desired attenuation. The designer of this
circuit must thus specify not only what the attenuation is, but also the resistance values employed so that
integrators—people who put systems together from component systems—can combine systems together and
have a chance of the combination working.
