The two-wattmeter method discussed here for measuring three-phase power makes use of
single-phase wattmeters. It may be noted, however, that three-phase wattmeters are also available,
which, when connected appropriately, indicate the total real power absorbed. The total reactive
power associated with the three-phase balanced load is given by
