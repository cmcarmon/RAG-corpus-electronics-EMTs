Suppose I were to place my two hands across the terminals of an AC voltage source at
60 Hz (60 cycles, or alternations back-and-forth, per second). How much voltage would be
necessary in this clean, dry state of skin condition to produce a current of 20 milliamps (enough
to cause me to become unable to let go of the voltage source)? We can use Ohmâ€™s Law (E=IR) to
determine this:
