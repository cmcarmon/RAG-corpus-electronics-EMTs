In this section we set out to show that a rotating ﬁeld of constant amplitude and sinusoidal
space distribution of mmf around a periphery of the stator is produced by a three-phase winding
located on the stator and excited by balanced three-phase currents when the respective phase
windings are wound 2π/3 electrical radians (or 120 electrical degrees) apart in space. Let us
consider the two-pole, three-phase winding arrangement on the stator shown in Figure 12.3.1.
The windings of the individual phases are displaced by 120 electrical degrees from each other in
space around the air-gap periphery. The reference directions are given for positive phase currents.
The concentrated full-pitch coils, shown here for simplicity and convenience, do in fact represent
the actual distributed windings producing sinusoidal mmf waves centered on the magnetic axes
of the respective phases. Thus, these three sinusoidal mmf waves are displaced by 120 electrical
degrees from each other in space. Let a balanced three-phase excitation be applied with phase
sequence a–b–c,
