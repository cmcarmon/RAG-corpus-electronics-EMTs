linear tape (DLT) was originally developed by
Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to be used in its
midsize systems. Presently, DLT is used to provide back-
up for midsize local area network (LAN). The current
transfer rate of DLT is a 800-KBps backup to tape car-
tridges that hold up to 40 GB of uncompressed data.
