From a disturbance rejection point of view, the Hâˆž controller can be used to minimize the root-mean-square
value of the controlled variable z due to the worst-case unit-energy disturbance w. This is to be contrasted with
LQG (or H2) controller, which minimizes the average response to a unit-variance random disturbance.
