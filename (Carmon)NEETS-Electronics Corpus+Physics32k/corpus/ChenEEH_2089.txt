The development of hierarchical predicate transition nets
(HPrTNs) was motivated by the need to construct speciﬁca-
tions for large systems using Petri nets (Reisig, 1987) and
inspired by the development of modern high-level program-
ming languages and other hierarchical and graphical nota-
tions, such as data ﬂow diagrams (Yourdon, 1989) and
statecharts (Harel, 1988). Similar work on introducing hier-
archies into colored Petri nets was given in Jensen (1992,
1995). With the introduction of hierarchical structures into
predicate transition nets, the resulting net speciﬁcations are
more understandable, and the speciﬁcation construction pro-
cess becomes more manageable. HPrTNs were used in specify-
ing several systems, including an elevator system (He and Lee,
1991), a library system (He and Yang, 1992), and a hurried
dining philosophers system (He and Ding, 2001). HPrTNs can
be analyzed directly by using a structural induction technique
combining structural, behavioral, and logical reasoning (He,
2001) and can be translated into program skeletons in a con-
current and parallel object-oriented programming language
CC þþ (He, 2000c) and Java (Lewandowski and He, 1998,
2000). A complete formal deﬁnition of HPrTNs was given in
He (1996). In the following subsections, basic concepts and
notation of HPrTNs are brieﬂy introduced.
