for vO > 0.
The current iD is 0 for vO â‰¤ 0. Assume K = 1 mA/V2.
We assume that the supposedly DC source (vI) supplying the circuit in reality has 5 volts
of DC (VI) with 50 mV of AC (vi, also called a ripple) superimposed. The regulator
is designed to reduce this unwanted AC component relative to the DC. Our task is
to determine the magnitude of the ripple in the output, and the extent to which our
regulator has been able to reduce the ripple amplitude relative to the DC voltage.
