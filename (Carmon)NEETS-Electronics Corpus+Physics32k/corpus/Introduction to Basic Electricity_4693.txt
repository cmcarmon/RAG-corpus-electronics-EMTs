Most digital computers can perform I/O operations 
at the request of an interrupt. An interrupt is a sig-
nal from an external device requesting service in the 
form of receiving or transmitting data. The interrupt 
results in the computer leaving the current program 
and jumping to another program. When the interrupt 
request is accomplished, the computer returns to the 
original program.
