Normally, the plane of polarization of a radio wave is the plane in which the E field propagates with 
respect to the Earth. If the E field component of the radiated wave travels in a plane perpendicular to the 
Earth's surface (vertical), the radiation is said to be VERTICALLY POLARIZED, as shown in figure 2-5, 
view A. If the E field propagates in a plane parallel to the Earth's surface (horizontal), the radiation is said 
to be HORIZONTALLY POLARIZED, as shown in view B.
