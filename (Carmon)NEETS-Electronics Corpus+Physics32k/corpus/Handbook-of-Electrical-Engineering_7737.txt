Also, the choice of coding technique can have a signiﬁcant effect on density. Standard modiﬁed frequency
modulation techniques require approximately one ﬂux change per bit, while more advanced run-length limited
codes can increase density by an additional factor of 50%. Densities as high as 31,429 bpi can be attained with
these techniques. As the recording densities increase, the transfer times decrease, as more bits transit beneath
the heads per unit time. Of course, this approach provides no improvement in seek and latency times. Most
of the increase in density comes from increases in the number of tracks per inch, which does not improve (and
may actually reduce) performance.
