Snow and ice sublime, although more slowly, at temperatures below the freezing/melting point temperature line at 0 Â°C for most pressures; see line below triple point. In freeze-drying, the material to be dehydrated is frozen and its water is allowed to sublime under reduced pressure or vacuum. The loss of snow from a snowfield during a cold spell is often caused by sunshine acting directly on the upper layers of the snow. Ablation is a process that includes sublimation and erosive wear of glacier ice.
