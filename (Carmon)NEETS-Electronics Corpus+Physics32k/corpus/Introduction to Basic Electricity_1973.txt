The total amount of work done may be accom-
plished in different lengths of time. For example, a 
given quantity of electrons may be moved from one 
location to another in one second, one minute, or 
one hour, depending on the rate in which they were 
moved. In all cases, the total amount of work done is 
the same. However, when the work is done in a short 
period of time, the instantaneous power rate (wattage) 
is greater than when the same amount of work is done 
over a longer period of time.
