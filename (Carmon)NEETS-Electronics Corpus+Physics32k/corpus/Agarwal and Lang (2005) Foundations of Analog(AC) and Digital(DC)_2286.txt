where E is the electric field and B is the magnetic flux which passes through
the surface outlined by the closed path of the integral, as depicted in Figure A.5.
We also know the preceding equation as Faraday’s law of induction. Notice
that if we choose the two points x and y to be the same, then we can obtain a
E · dl. Thus it appears our definition of potential
nonzero value for
difference or voltage has no useful meaning in this case. However, are there
constraints that we can apply for which a unique voltage can be defined?
