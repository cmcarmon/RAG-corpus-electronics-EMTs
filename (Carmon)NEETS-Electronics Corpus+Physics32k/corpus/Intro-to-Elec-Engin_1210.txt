Unlike shunt-ﬁeld control, armature-resistance control offers a constant-torque drive because
both ﬂux and, to a ﬁrst approximation, allowable armature current remain constant as speed varies.
The shunted-armature method is a variation of this control scheme. This is illustrated in Figure
13.4.11(a) as applied to a series motor, and in Figure 13.4.11(b) as applied to a shunt motor.
Resistors R1 and R2 act as voltage dividers applying a reduced voltage to the armature. They offer
greater ﬂexibility in their adjustments to provide the desired performance.
