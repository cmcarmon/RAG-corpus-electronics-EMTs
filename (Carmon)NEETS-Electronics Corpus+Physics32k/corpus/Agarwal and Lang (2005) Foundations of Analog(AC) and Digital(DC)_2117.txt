Figure 15.3c offers more insight. We see that in the center of the charac-
teristic, the output voltage is approximately proportional to the input voltage,
âˆ’
or, more precisely, to the difference between v
and v
are labels for voltages, and hence each can be positive or negative, depending
on the circuit.) If we idealize this relationship by making it linear, then the curve
of Figure 15.5 results. The curve can now be expressed mathematically as
