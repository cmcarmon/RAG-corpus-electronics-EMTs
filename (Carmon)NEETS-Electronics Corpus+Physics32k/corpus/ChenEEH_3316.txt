The entries of the F function in equation 7.54 are the
differences between the speciﬁed power injections and the
computed power injections from the current power ﬂow solu-
tions, and these are usually denoted as the real and reactive
power mismatches at the different busses. In the power ﬂow
problem, we want to ﬁnd a solution that makes the power
mismatches in equation 7.54 equal zero.
