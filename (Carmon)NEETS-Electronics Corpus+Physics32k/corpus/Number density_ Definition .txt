Volume number density is the number of specified objects per unit volume:




n
=


N
V


,


{\displaystyle n={\frac {N}{V}},}

where N is the total number of objects in a volume V.
Here it is assumed that N is large enough that rounding of the count to the nearest integer does not introduce much of an error, however V is chosen to be small enough that the resulting n does not depend much on the size or shape of the volume V.
