Properties of the CT Fourier Transform
The  CT  Fourier  transform  has  many  properties  that  make  it  useful  for  the  analysis  and  design  of  linear  CT
systems. Some of the more useful properties are summarized in this section, while a more complete list of the
CT  Fourier  transform  properties  is  given  in  Table  14.2.  Proofs  of  these  properties  are  found  in  Oppenheim
