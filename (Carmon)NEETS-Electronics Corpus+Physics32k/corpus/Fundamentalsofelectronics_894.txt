As we consider other block codes, the simple idea of the decoder taking a majority vote of the received bits
won’t generalize easily. We need a broader view that takes into account the distance between codewords.
A length-N codeword means that the receiver must decide among the 2N possible data words to select
which of the 2K codewords was actually transmitted. As shown in Figure 6.22, we can think of the data
words geometrically. We deﬁne the Hamming distance between binary data words c1 and c2, denoted by
d (c1, c2) to be the minimum number of bits that must be “ﬂipped” to go from one word to the other. For
example, the distance between codewords is 3 bits. In our table of binary arithmetic, we see that adding
a 1 corresponds to ﬂipping a bit. Furthermore, subtraction and addition are equivalent. We can express the
Hamming distance as
