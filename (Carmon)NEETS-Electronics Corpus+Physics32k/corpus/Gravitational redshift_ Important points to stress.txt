The receiving end of the light transmission must be located at a higher gravitational potential in order for gravitational redshift to be observed. In other words, the observer must be standing "uphill" from the source. If the observer is at a lower gravitational potential than the source, a gravitational blueshift can be observed instead.
Tests done by many universities continue to support the existence of gravitational redshift.
General relativity is not the only theory of gravity that predicts gravitational redshift. Other theories of gravitation require gravitational redshift, although their detailed explanations for why it appears vary. (Any theory that includes conservation of energy and mass–energy equivalence must include gravitational redshift.)
Gravitational redshift does not assume the Schwarzschild metric solution to Einstein's field equation – in which the variable

cannot represent the mass of any rotating or charged body.
