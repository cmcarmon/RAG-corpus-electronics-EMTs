Since the ions are charged, they cannot pass through the membrane via simple diffusion. Two different mechanisms can transport the ions across the membrane: active or passive transport. An example of active transport of ions is the Na+-K+-ATPase (NKA). NKA catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP into ADP and an inorganic phosphate and for every molecule of ATP hydrolized, three Na+ are transported outside and two K+ are transported inside the cell. This makes the inside of the cell more negative than the outside and more specifically generates a Vm of about -60mV. An example of passive transport is ion fluxes through Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Cl− channels. These ions tend to move down their concentration gradient. For example, since there is a high concentration of Na+ outside the cell, Na+ will flow through the Na+ channel into the cell. Since the electric potential inside the cell is negative, the influx of a positive ion depolarizes the membrane which brings the transmembrane electric potential closer to zero. However, Na+ will continue moving down its concentration gradient as long as the effect of the chemical gradient is greater than the effect of the electrical gradient. Once the effect of both gradients are equal (for Na+ this at a Vm of about +70mV), the influx of Na+ stops because the driving force (ΔG) is zero. The equation for the driving force is:

In this equation, R represents the gas constant, T represents absolute temperature, Z is the ionic charge, and F represents the Faraday constant.
