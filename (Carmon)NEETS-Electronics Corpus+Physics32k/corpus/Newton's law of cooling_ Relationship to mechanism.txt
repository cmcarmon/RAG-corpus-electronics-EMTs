Convection-cooling is sometimes called "Newton's law of cooling." This use is based on a work by Isaac Newton published anonymously as "Scala graduum Caloris. Calorum Descriptiones & signa." in Philosophical Transactions, 1701,
In cases where the heat transfer coefficient is independent, or relatively independent, of the temperature difference between object and environment, Newton's law is followed. This independence is sometimes the case, but is not guaranteed to be so. The heat transfer coefficient is often relatively independent of temperature in purely conduction-type cooling, but becomes a function of the temperature in classical natural convective heat transfer. In this case, Newton's law only approximates the result when the temperature changes are relatively small. Newton himself realized this limitation.
A correction to Newton's law concerning larger temperature differentials was made in 1817 by Dulong and Petit. (These men are better-known for their formulation of the Dulongâ€“Petit law concerning the molar specific heat capacity of a crystal.)
Another situation with temperature-dependent transfer coefficient is radiative heat transfer, which also does not obey Newton's law.
