INDUCTION MOTORS are the most commonly used of all electric motors due to their simplicity
and low cost. Induction motors may be single-phase or multiphase. They do not require electrical rotor
connection. Split-phase motors with special starting windings, and shaded-pole motors, are types of
single-phase induction motors.
