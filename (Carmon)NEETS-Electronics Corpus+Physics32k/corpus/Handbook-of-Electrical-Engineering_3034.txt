This scheme has the advantage of design ease since simple equations can be derived relating the components
of each section to the coefﬁcients of each factor in the VTF. Also, each biquad can be independently adjusted
relatively easily to give the correct performance. Because of these important practical merits, a large number
of alternative biquad structures have been proposed, and the newcomer may easily ﬁnd the choice overwhelming.
The second approach to active ﬁlter synthesis involves the use of RC-active circuits to simulate passive LCR
ladders. This has two important advantages. First, the design process can be very straightforward: the wealth
of design data published for passive ladder ﬁlters (see Further Information) can be used directly so that the
sometimes  difﬁcult  process  of  component  value  synthesis  from  speciﬁcation  is  eliminated.  Second,  the  LCR
 properties [Orchard, 1966], and RC-active ﬁlters designed by ladder simulation
ladder offers optimal 
share the same low sensitivity features. Chapter 4 of Bowron and Stephenson [1979] gives an excellent intro-
duction to the formal treatment of circuit sensitivity.
