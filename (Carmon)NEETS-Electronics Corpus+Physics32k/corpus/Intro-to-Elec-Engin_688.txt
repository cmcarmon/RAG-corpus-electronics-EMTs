Integrated circuits (ICs), in which several transistors, resistors, wires, and even other com-
ponents are all fabricated in a single chip of semiconductor, are ideal building blocks for
electronic systems. Space, weight, cost, and reliability considerations gave much impetus for
the development of ICs. The ability to place circuit elements closer on an IC chip helps in
extending the frequency range of the devices. Whereas the IC technology involves the use of only
solid-state devices, resistors, and capacitors, the elimination of inductors is necessitated by the
