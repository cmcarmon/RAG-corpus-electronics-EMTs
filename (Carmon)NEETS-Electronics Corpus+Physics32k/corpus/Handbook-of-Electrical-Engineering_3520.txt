Fig. 34.8.  The VHDL  model,  called  a 
machine [Dewey, 1983, 1992, 1997]. The entity statement deﬁnes the interface, i.e., the ports. The ports include
two input signals, X and CLK, and an output signal Z. The ports are of type BIT, which speciﬁes that the signals
may  only  carry  the  values  0  or  1.  The  architecture  statement  deﬁnes  the  input/output  transform  via  two
concurrent signal assignment statements. The internal signal STATE holds the ﬁnite state information and is
driven  by  a  guarded,  conditional  concurrent  signal  assignment  statement  that  executes  when  the  associated
block expression
