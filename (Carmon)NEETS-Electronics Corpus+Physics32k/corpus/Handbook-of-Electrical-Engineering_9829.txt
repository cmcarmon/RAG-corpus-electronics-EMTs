Frequency Response Analysis Using the Bode Diagram
The steady-state response of a stable linear constant-coefﬁcient system has particular signiﬁcance, as we know
from an elementary study of electrical networks and circuits and of dynamics. We consider a stable linear system
with input-output transfer function
