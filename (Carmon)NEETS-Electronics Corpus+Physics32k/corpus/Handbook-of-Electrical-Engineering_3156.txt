There  are  several  other  topologies  of  resonant  link  inverters  mentioned  in  the  literature.  There  are  also
resonant link ac-ac converters based on bidirectional ac switches, as shown in Fig. 30.16. These resonant link
converters Ô¨Ånd applications in ac machine control and uninterrupted power supplies, induction heating, etc.
The resonant link inverter technology is still in the development stage for industrial applications.
