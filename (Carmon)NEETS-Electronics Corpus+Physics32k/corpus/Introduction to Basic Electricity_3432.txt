Integrated circuits are more reliable than directly 
connected transistor circuits. In the integrated circuit, 
internal components are connected permanently. All 
the components are formed at the same time, reduc-
ing the chance for error. After the integrated circuit is 
formed, it is pretested before final assembly.
