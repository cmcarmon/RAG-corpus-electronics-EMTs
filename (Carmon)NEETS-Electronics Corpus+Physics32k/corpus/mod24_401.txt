A fiber optic connector is a demateable device that permits the coupling of optical power between
two optical fibers or two groups of fibers. Designing a device that allows for repeated fiber coupling
without significant loss of light is difficult. Fiber optic connectors must maintain fiber alignment and
provide repeatable loss measurements during numerous connections. Fiber optic connectors should be
easy to assemble (in a laboratory or field environment) and should be cost effective. They should also be
reliable. Fiber optic connections using connectors should be insensitive to environmental conditions, such
as temperature, dust, and moisture. Fiber optic connector designs attempt to optimize connector
performance by meeting each of these conditions.
