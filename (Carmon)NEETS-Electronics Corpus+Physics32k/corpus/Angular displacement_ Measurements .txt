Angular displacement may be measured in radians or degrees. Using radians provides a very simple relationship between distance traveled around the circle and the distance r from the centre.

{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {s}{r}}}

For example, if an object rotates 360° around a circle of radius r, the angular displacement is given by the distance traveled around the circumference - which is 2πr - divided by the radius:

r




{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {2\pi r}{r}}}
which easily simplifies to:

{\displaystyle \theta =2\pi }
. Therefore, 1 revolution is

When a particle travels from point P to point Q over

{\displaystyle \Delta \theta =\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}}
which equals the angular displacement.
