There are many factors that can affect joint patterns, such as: walking speed, gender, terrain, and gait pathologies. During stance phase the stance limb is considered to be functioning as a closed kinetic chain. Therefore, any type of musculoskeletal impairment would affect not only the joint at which that muscle crosses but also joints throughout the entire chain. Theoretically, if one joint does not adequately contribute during single-limb support, then the other joints must compensate to accomplish the goal of toe clearance and forward progression.
Joint mobility could also affect walking patterns. For instance, if an individual has limited knee extension this could result in a functionally shorter limb affecting kinematics of both the stance and swing limbs. Similarly, a lack of knee flexion could potentially interfere with toe clearance and lead to compensatory patterns at the hip joint such as excessive hip flexion. Limited mobility of the ankle could also result in abnormal gait patterns. When walking at an average speed of ambulation (~1.25 m/s) the ankle joint requires at least 10-20 degrees of plantar flexion. Limited ankle plantar flexion may result in decreased push off force, which could lead to shorter step length. To compensate for this impairment, increased knee or hip flexion of the swing limb would be needed.
