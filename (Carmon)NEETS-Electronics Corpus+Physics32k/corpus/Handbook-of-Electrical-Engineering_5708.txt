While the characteristic harmonics of the large power converter are reduced by Ô¨Ålters, it is not economical
to  reduce  in  that  way  the  uncharacteristic  harmonics  and,  therefore,  even  small  injection  of  these  harmonic
currents can, via parallel resonant conditions, produce very large voltage distortion levels.
