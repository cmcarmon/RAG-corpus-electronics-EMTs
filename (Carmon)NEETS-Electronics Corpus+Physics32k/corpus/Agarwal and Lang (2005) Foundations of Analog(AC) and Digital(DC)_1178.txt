As the second step, we must determine linearized small-signal models for each of the
circuit components. This step is trivial for our example, since all the elements are linear
(including the BJT, since we are given that it always operates in its active region). The
small-signal equivalents for the DC sources are short circuits, and those for the linear
resistors are the resistors themselves. Finally, we will use the small-signal model for the
BJT operating in its active region (developed in Example 8.6) illustrated in Figure 8.42c.
