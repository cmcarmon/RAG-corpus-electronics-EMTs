In the case of a circuit having inductance, the opposing force of the counter emf would be enough to 
keep the current from remaining in phase with the applied voltage. You learned that in a dc circuit 
containing pure inductance the current took time to rise to maximum even though the full applied voltage 
was immediately at maximum. Figure 4-1(B) shows the wave forms for a purely inductive ac circuit in 
steps of quarter-cycles.
