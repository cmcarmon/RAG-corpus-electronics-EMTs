Existing algorithms for clock skew scheduling are reviewed
in this section.9 The classical linear programming approach
for minimizing only the clock period TCP of a circuit is
ﬁrst described in the subsection entitled Clock Scheduling
for Maximum Performance. A new quantitative measure to
compare different clock schedules is introduced in Further
Improvement. This section is concluded by sketching the
clock skew scheduling problem as an efﬁciently solvable
problem in Clock Scheduling as a Quadratic Programming
Problem.
