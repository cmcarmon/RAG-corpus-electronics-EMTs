density produced by the ﬁeld. As the rotor turns, the currents
in the armature conductors are switched by a commutator so
that the ﬁeld pattern remains the same. The dc machine is
inherently a variable speed machine. The speed and torque can
be controlled by the ﬁeld current and by the armature voltage.
Machines that are ac run at constant speed or near-constant
speed, the speed being determined by the supply frequency.
