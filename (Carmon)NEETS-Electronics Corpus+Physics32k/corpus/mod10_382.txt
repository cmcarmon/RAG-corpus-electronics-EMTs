In addition to long-term fading, the tropospheric scatter signal often is characterized by very rapid 
fading because of multipath propagation. Since the turbulent condition is constantly changing, the path 
lengths and individual signal levels are also changing, resulting in a rapidly changing signal. Although the 
signal level of the received signal is constantly changing, the average signal level is stable; therefore, no 
complete fade out occurs.
