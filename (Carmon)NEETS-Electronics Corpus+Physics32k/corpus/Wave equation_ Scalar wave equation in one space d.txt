The wave equation in one space dimension can be written as follows:








∂

u


∂

t

=

c

∂

u


∂

x

{\displaystyle {\partial ^{2}u \over \partial t^{2}}=c^{2}{\partial ^{2}u \over \partial x^{2}}}
.
This equation is typically described as having only one space dimension "x", because the only other independent variable is the time "t". Nevertheless, the dependent variable "u" may represent a second space dimension, if, for example, the displacement "u" takes place in y-direction, as in the case of a string that is located in the x-y plane.
