Because the gate-to-source voltage is reverse  biased, 
the JFET has an extremely high input resistance. If the 
gate-to-source voltage were forward biased, a large 
current would flow through the channel, causing the 
input resistance to drop and reducing the gain of the 
device. The amount of gate-to-source voltage required 
to reduce ID to zero is called the gate-to-source	
	cutoff	voltage	(EGS(off)). The manufacturer of the 
device specifies this value.
