The group has tackled the problem of earthquake and rupture prediction since the mid-90s within the broader physical concept of critical phenomena. Considering rupture as a second-order phase transition, this predicts that, approaching rupture, the spatial correlation length of stress and damage increases. This in turn leads to a power-law acceleration of moment and strain release, up to the macroscopic failure time of the sample (i.e. a large earthquake in nature). This prediction has been checked on various natural and industrial/laboratory data, over a wide spectrum of different scales (laboratory samples, mines, California earthquakes catalog), and under different loading conditions of the system (constant stress rate, constant strain rate). The most puzzling observation is that the critical power-law rate acceleration is decorated by log-periodic oscillations, suggesting a universal ratio close to 2.2. The existence of such oscillations stems from interactions between seismogenic structures (see below for the case of faults and fractures), but also offers a better constraint to identify areas within which a large event may occur. See for instance. The novel concept of critical piezo-electricity in polycrystals  has been applied to the Earth crust.
