The sport's origins date to the 1930s in California, when the Southern California Timing Association first held meets for a variety of hot rodded vehicles.
Ever since, any vehicle – car, truck, or motorcycle – able to meet the safety regulations has been able to make an attempt to break the existing record. The record is set by averaging two runs (commonly called "passes"), one in either direction, within the space of two hours.
All vehicles are separated by classes based on displacement.
