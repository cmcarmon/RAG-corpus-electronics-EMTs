Currents add up algebraically as well, and can either be superimposed as done with the
resistor voltage drops, or simply calculated from the Ô¨Ånal voltage drops and respective resis-
tances (I=E/R). Either way, the answers will be the same. Here I will show the superposition
method applied to current:
