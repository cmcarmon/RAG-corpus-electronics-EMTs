We must analyze afresh how this revised circuit, shown in Figure 3.12, works. Rather than deﬁning eight
variables and solving for the current in the load resistor, let’s take a hint from other analysis (series rules
(p. 38), parallel rules (p. 40)). Resistors R2 and RL are in a parallel conﬁguration: The voltages across
each resistor are the same while the currents are not. Because the voltages are the same, we can ﬁnd the
current through each from their v-i relations: i2 = vout
. Considering the node where all three
R2
resistors join, KCL says that the sum of the three currents must equal zero. Said another way, the current
entering the node through R1 must equal the sum of the other two currents leaving the node. Therefore,
i1 = i2 + iL, which means that i1 = vout
