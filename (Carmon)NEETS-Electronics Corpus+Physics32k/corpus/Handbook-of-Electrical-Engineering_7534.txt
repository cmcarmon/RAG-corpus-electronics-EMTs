The propagation
delay of a logic device limits the frequency at which it can be operated. There are two propagation delay times
, delay time for the
speciÔ¨Åed for logic gates: 
output  to  change  from  low  to  high.  Average  typical  propagation  delay  times  for  a  single  gate  are  listed  for
several logic subfamilies in Table 79.5. The ECL family has the fastest switching speed.
