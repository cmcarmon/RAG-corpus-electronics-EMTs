In selecting an IC regulator, the voltage and load 
current requirements must be known along with the 
electrical characteristics of the unregulated power sup-
ply. Their output voltage classifies IC regulators. Fixed 
voltage regulators have three terminals and provide 
only one output voltage. They are available in both 
positive and negative voltages. Dual-polarity voltage 
regulators can supply both a positive voltage and a 
negative voltage. Both fixed- and dual-polarity voltage 
regulators are available as adjustable voltage regula-
tors. If using any of the IC voltage regulators, refer to 
the manufacturerâ€™s specification sheet.
