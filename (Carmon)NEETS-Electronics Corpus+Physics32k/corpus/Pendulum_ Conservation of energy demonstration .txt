Pendulums are used in science education to demonstrate the law of conservation of energy. A heavy object such as a bowling ball or wrecking ball is attached to a string. The weight is then moved to within a few inches of a volunteer's face, then released and allowed to swing and come back. In most instances, the weight reverses direction slightly before the position it was released from, and the volunteer is unharmed. On occasion, the volunteer does not stand still and is injured.
