It is important to explore the ordering freedom of the data
transfers before scheduling the data processing itself, and not
to do it the other way around. First of all, the cost of the data
transfers is much higher than the cost of data processing,
especially in data-transfer intensive applications. In addition,
the constraints coming from Ô¨Årst ordering the data transfers
do not limit the scheduling freedom of the data processing too
much, whereas the reverse is certainly not true.
