calculated from Equation 14.29 because |H| will be at 0.707 of its maximum
when the denominator becomes G(1 ± j1). (Notice that when the denomi-
√
nator of H becomes G(1 ± j1), the magnitude |H| becomes 1/
2G, which
is equivalent to 0.707/G.) In other words, for ω1 = ω0.707, |H| will be at
0.707 of its maximum, and
