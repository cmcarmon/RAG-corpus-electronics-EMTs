3. It can simultaneously and quickly assess proximity to voltage instability for all agents where each has a
bifurcating eigenvalue. Proximity to instability of any agent is measured by assessing (1) the percentage
of  voltage  control  areas  containing  generators  in  a  reactive  reserve  basin  with  non-zero  reserves,  and
(2) the percentage of base case reactive reserves remaining on reactive reserve basin voltage control areas
that have not yet exhausted reserves [Schlueter, 1998b; f].
