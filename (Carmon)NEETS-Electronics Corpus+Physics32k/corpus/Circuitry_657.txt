shown  in  Fig.  14.7.  One  of  the  meters  is  an 
analogue  type  having  an  internal  resistance  of  10 
kW on the 10 V range. The other is a digital type 
that has the much higher internal resistance of 10 
MW.    The  two  potential  dividers  each  consist  of 
resistors or identical value. However, the potential 
divider of Fig. 14.7(b) has a much lower resistance 
than  that  of  Fig.  14.7(a).  In  both  cases  the  ‘true’ 
voltage  produced  by  the  potential  divider  should 
be  half  the  supply,  i.e.  exactly  5  V.  The  actual 
readings obtained from the instruments are shown 
in Table 14.1.
