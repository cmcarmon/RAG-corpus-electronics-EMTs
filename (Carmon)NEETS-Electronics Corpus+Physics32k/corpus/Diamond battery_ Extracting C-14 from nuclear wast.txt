In graphite-moderated reactors fissile uranium rods are placed inside graphite blocks. These blocks act as neutron moderators and their purpose is to slow down the fast moving neutrons so that nuclear chain reaction can occur with thermal neutrons. During their use, some of the non-radioactive (C-12) in graphite gets converted into radioactive C-14 by capturing neutrons Once the graphite blocks are removed during station decommissioning their induced radioactivity qualifies them as low-level waste, and disposal is a tough job.
Researchers at the University of Bristol earlier showed that radioactive C-14 developed in waste blocks is mainly concentrated on the outer parts of the block. Due to this, much of it can be effectively removed from the blocks. This can be done by heating them to the sublimation point of 3915 K (3642 °C, 6588 °F) which will release the carbon in gaseous form. After removal, blocks will be less radioactive and more easy to dispose of.
