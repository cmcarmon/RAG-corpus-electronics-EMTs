end-plate,  or  synaptic  terminals.  This  ending  does  not
actually make physical contact with the soma or dendrite
but is separated by a narrow cleft (gap) of approximately
 m) wide. This is known as the synaptic
100 to 200 Å (10
cleft. Each of these synaptic endings contains a large num-
ber of submicroscopic spherical structures (synaptic vesi-
cles)  that  can  be  detected  only  under  an  electron
microscope. These synaptic vesicles, in turn, are essentially
“chemical carriers” containing transmitter substance that
is released into the synaptic cleft on excitation.
