With a LENS ANTENNA you can convert spherically radiated microwave energy into a plane wave 
(in a given direction) by using a point source (open end of the waveguide) with a COLLIMATING LENS. 
A collimating lens forces all radial segments of the spherical wavefront into parallel paths. The point 
source can be regarded as a gun which shoots the microwave energy toward the lens. The point source is 
often a horn radiator or a simple dipole antenna.
