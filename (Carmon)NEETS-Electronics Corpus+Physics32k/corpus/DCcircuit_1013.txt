As with any theorem of geometry or algebra, these network theorems are derived from
fundamental rules. In this chapter, I’m not going to delve into the formal proofs of any of
these theorems. If you doubt their validity, you can always empirically test them by setting
up example circuits and calculating values using the “old” (simultaneous equation) methods
versus the “new” theorems, to see if the answers coincide. They always should!
