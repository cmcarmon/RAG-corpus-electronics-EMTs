To  better  understand  solder  joint  formation,  one  must  understand  the  make-up  of  solder  paste  used  for
SMT  soldering.  The  solder  paste  consists  of  microscopic  balls  of  solder,  most  commonly  tin-lead  with  the
accompanying oxide ﬁlm, ﬂux, and activator and thickener solvents as shown in Fig. 26.9.
