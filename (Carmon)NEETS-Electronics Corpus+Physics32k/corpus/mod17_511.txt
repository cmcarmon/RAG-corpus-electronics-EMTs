Solar cells are installed around the outside surface of a spin-stabilized satellite. This gives you a 
large number of solar cells exposed to the sun at all times (except when the satellite is in eclipse). The use 
of omnidirectional antennas causes a small part of the total radiated energy to be directed toward the earth 
at all times.
