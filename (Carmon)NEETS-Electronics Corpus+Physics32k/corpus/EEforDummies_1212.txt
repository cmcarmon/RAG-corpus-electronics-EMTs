of the breadboard.
It’s easier if you use a 9 V battery clip, which contains prestripped leads. 
You may want to solder 22‐gauge solid hookup wire to the ends of the 
leads from the clip; this makes it easier to insert the wires into the sol-
derless breadboard. Remember: The red lead from the battery clip is the 
positive terminal of the battery, and the black lead is the negative termi-
nal, or ground.
