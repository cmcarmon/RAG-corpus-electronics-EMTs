In the circuit, a DC source with value VO is applied across the capacitor using switch S1. The DC
source forces the capacitor voltage to VO. This DC source is switched out as shown at t = 0, and
another DC source with voltage V is switched in using switch S2. This action applies a step voltage
of magnitude V to the capacitor, which has an initial voltage VO at t = 0.
