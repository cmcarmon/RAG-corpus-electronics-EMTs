To CONVERT DECIMAL FRACTIONS, multiply the fraction by the base of the desired number
system. Extract those digits that move to the left of the radix point. Continue to multiply the fractional
product for as many places as needed. The first digit left of the radix point will be the MSD, and the last
will be the LSD. The example to the right shows the process of converting 248.3210 to the octal equivalent
(370.2438).
