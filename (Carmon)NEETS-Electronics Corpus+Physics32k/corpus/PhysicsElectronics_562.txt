The arrangement of two NPN transistors shown in Ô¨Ågure 5.20a is known as the Darlington
connection. The three unconnected terminals, the base of Q1 and the collector and emitter
of Q2, behave like a single transistor with current gain hf e1hf e2 and an overall base to emitter
DC voltage drop of 2VP N . Two transistors in the Darlington connection can be purchased
in a single three-terminal package.
