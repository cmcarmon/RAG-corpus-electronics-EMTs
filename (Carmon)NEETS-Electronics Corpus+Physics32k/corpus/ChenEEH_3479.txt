of time (and is often periodic) and the transient. The latter
generally exists for a few milliseconds, and then decays to zero.
Controversy surrounds which is more important, and a case
could be made for either type of disturbance being more prob-
lematic as far as cost. The steady-state type of disturbance is
generally less evident in its appearance, often at lower voltage
and current levels, and less harmful to the operation of the
system. Because steady-state phenomena last for a long period
of time, the integrated effects of active power losses (low or high
voltage) and inaccurate timing signals may be quite costly. Tran-
sient effects tend to be higher level in amplitude and are often
quite apparent in harmful effects as well as occasionally spec-
tacular in cost (e.g., causing loss of a manufactured product or
causing long-term outages). The cost of transient power quality
problems has been estimated in the 100 million to 3 billion dollar
range annually in the United States. Table 10.2 lists some types of
steady-state and transient power quality problems. The transient
problems are often termed events.
