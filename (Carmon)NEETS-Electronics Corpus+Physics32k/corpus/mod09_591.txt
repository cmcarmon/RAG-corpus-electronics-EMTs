Timing circuits and circuits which require a particular shape or "spike" of voltage, may use 
SHAPING circuits. Shaping circuits can be used to cause wave shapes, such as square waves, sawtooth 
waves, and trapezoidal waves, to change their shape. Shaping circuits may be either series RC or series 
RL circuits. The time constant is controlled in respect to the duration of the applied waveform. Notice that 
the wave shapes mentioned did not include the sine wave. These RC or RL shaping circuits do not change 
the shape of a pure sine wave.
