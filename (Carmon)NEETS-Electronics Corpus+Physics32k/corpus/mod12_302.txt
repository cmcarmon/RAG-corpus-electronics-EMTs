Letâ€™s review some voltage phase relationships. Look at figure 2-18 and compare the three voltages
(A, B, and C). Since voltage A begins its cycle and reaches its peak before voltage B, it is said to lead
voltage B. Voltage C, on the other hand, lags voltage B by 30 degrees. In phase modulation the phase of
the carrier is caused to shift at the rate of the af modulating signal. In figure 2-19, note that the
unmodulated carrier has constant phase, amplitude, and frequency. The dotted wave shape represents the
modulated carrier. Notice that the phase on the second peak leads the phase of the unmodulated carrier.
On the third peak the shift is even greater; however, on-the fourth peak, the peaks begin to realign phase
with each other. These relationships represent the effect of 1/2 cycle of an af modulating signal. On the
negative alternation of the af intelligence, the phase of the carrier would lag and the peaks would occur at
times later than they would in the unmodulated carrier.
