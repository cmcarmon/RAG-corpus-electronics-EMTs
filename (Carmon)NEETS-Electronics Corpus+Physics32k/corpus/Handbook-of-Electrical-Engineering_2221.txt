Electrons and Holes
The  concentration  of  electrons  in  the  valence  band  can  be  controlled  by  introducing  impurity  atoms.  For

example, the substitutional doping of Si with As results in a local energy level with an energy about 
 [Fig. 22.2(b)]. At room temperature this impurity center is readily
meV below the conduction band edge, 
ionized, and (in the absence of other impurities) the concentration of electrons is close to the concentration
of As atoms. Impurities of this type are known as donors.
