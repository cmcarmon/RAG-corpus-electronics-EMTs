The Neyman-Pearson detector can be further characterized
by the receiver–operation curve (ROC) shown in Figure 6.2,
which is a plot of equation 6.52, parameterized by d, the SNR.
It should be noted that all continuous LRTs have ROCs that
are above the line of a ¼ b and are concave downward. In
addition, the slope of a curve in a ROC curve at a particular
point is the value of the threshold l required to achieve the
prescribed value of a and b.
