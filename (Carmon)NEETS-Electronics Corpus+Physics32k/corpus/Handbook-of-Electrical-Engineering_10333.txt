The IDU is located near the user terminal equipment. Major IDU functions include outbound carrier signal
acquisition,  tracking,  demodulation,  bit  synchronization,  burst  modulation,  and  protocol  processing.  It  also
controls  the  operation  of  the  ODU,  monitors VSAT  health,  and  responds  to  hub  commands.  The  baseband
processing system performs satellite channel access and protocol and customer interface processing functions.
A video/audio port can be provided with an RF splitter at the IDU to separate the received audio/video signal
for the optional video/ audio receiver.
