This system consists of two tanks of mercury fastened to opposite sides of the gyro case and 
connected by a small mercury tube as shown in figure 3-12. A small air tube is also connected between 
the tanks to prevent a vacuum from forming. If the spin axis tilts away from the vertical, as shown, the 
mercury will flow from one tank to the other. The added weight in the left tank provides a torque which 
causes the gyro to precess. At this point, if you were to apply the rule for precession, you would see that 
the precession would be 90ยบ away from the desired direction.
