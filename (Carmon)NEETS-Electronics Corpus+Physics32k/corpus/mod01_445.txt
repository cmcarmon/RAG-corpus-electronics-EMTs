The schematic in figure 3-2 represents a flashlight. View A of the figure shows the flashlight in the
off or deenergized state. The switch (S1) is open. There is no complete path for current (I) through the
circuit, and the bulb (DS1) does not light. In figure 3-2 view B, switch S1 is closed. Current flows in the
direction of the arrows from the negative terminal of the battery (BAT), through the switch (S1), through
the lamp (DS1), and back to the positive terminal of the battery. With the switch closed the path for
current is complete. Current will continue to flow until the switch (S1) is moved to the open position or
the battery is completely discharged.
