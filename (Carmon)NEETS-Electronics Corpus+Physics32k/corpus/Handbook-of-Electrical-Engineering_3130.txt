that will cause a large enough voltage drop to activate the thyristor. Hence, the device manufacturer speciﬁes
the peak allowable collector current that can ﬂow without latch-up occurring. There is also a corresponding
gate source voltage that permits this current to ﬂow that should not be exceeded.
