The Deborah number (De) is a dimensionless number, often used in rheology to characterize the fluidity of materials under specific flow conditions. It is based on the premise that given enough time even a solid-like material will flow. The flow characteristics are not inherent properties of the material alone, but a relative property which depends on two fundamentally different characteristic times.
