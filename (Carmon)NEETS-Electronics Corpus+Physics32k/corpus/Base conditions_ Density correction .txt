Density correction is also performed on liquids under measurement. For instance, the sticker on gasoline pumps that states that the volume is corrected to 15 °C (59 °F, or 60 °F in the U.S.) means that the measured volume has been compensated for thermal expansion. One would otherwise get a larger mass of gasoline in a tank filled in cold weather (which is unfair to the business) and less when it is warm (which is unfair to the consumer).

UPDATE

Gas at a filling station is stored underground and is therefore at a constant temperature. The outside temperature has no bearing on this constant ground temperature and therefore the pumped fuel will always be at that temperature and needs not be corrected to 15 degrees but measured at the ground temperature.

Ground gets warmer and cooler with varying temperatures. You'd have to dig down pretty deep to keep it constant.
