Along with ac transmission in the United States, there have been modern high-voltage dc
(HVDC) transmission lines: the ±400-kV, 1360-km Paciﬁc Intertie line between Oregon and
California in 1970 as well as four other HVDC lines up to 400 kV and ﬁve back-to-back ac–dc
links as of 1991. A total of 30 HVDC lines up to 533 kV are in place worldwide. For an HVDC line
interconnected with an ac system, solid-state converters at both ends of the dc line are needed to
operate as rectiﬁers and inverters. Studies in the United States have shown that overhead HVDC
transmission is economical for transmission distances longer than about 600 km. Also, HVDC
links seem to improve the overall system stability.
