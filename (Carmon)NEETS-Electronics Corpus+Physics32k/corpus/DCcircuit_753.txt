Unfortunately, this would create a calibration problem for the meter. If the meter movement
deﬂects full-scale with a certain amount of current through it, the full-scale range of the meter
in ohms would change as the source voltage changed. Imagine connecting a stable resistance
across the test leads of this ohmmeter while varying the source voltage: as the voltage is
increased, there will be more current through the meter movement, hence a greater amount
of deﬂection. What we really need is a meter movement that will produce a consistent, stable
deﬂection for any stable resistance value measured, regardless of the applied voltage.
