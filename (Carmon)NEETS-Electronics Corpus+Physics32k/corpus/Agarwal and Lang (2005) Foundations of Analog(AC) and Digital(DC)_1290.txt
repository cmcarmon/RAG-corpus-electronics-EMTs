A transformer is a two-port device made by winding a second coil around the
inductor, for example, that shown in Figure 9.13. Let the first (or primary) coil
have N1 turns and the second (or secondary) coil have N2 turns. The symbol for
an ideal transformer having this construction is shown in Figure 9.29. The two
dots indicate the ends of the two coils that are wound in the same direction.
