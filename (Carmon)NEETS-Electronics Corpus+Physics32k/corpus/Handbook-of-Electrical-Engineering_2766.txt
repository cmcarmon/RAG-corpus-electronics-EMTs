Full Custom Design
In full custom design, custom logic cells are designed, starting at the lowest level (i.e., transistor-based cell design)
and extending to higher levels (e.g., combinations of cells for higher-level functions) to create the overall IC
function. Figure 25.31(a) illustrates the general layout at the cell level. The designer can exploit new cell designs
