The following is an outline of how to perform a basic shell balance.
If fluid is flowing between two horizontal surfaces, each with area A touching the fluid, a differential shell of height Δy can be drawn between them as shown in the diagram below.

In this example, the top surface is moving at velocity U and the bottom surface is stationarydensity of fluid = ρviscosity of fluid = μ
velocity in x direction =

{\displaystyle V_{x}}
, shown by the diagonal line above. This is what a shell balance is solving for.
Conservation of Momentum is the Key of a Shell Balance
rate of momentum in - rate of momentum out + sum of all forces = 0
To perform a shell balance, follow the following basic steps:
1. Find momentum from shear stress
(Momentum from Shear Stress Into System) - (Momentum from Shear Stress Out of System)
Momentum from Shear Stress goes into the shell at y and leaves the system at y + Δy.
Shear stress = τyx, area = A, momentum = τyxA
2. Find momentum from flow
Momentum flows into the system at x = 0 and out at x = L
The flow is steady state. Therefore, the momentum flow at x = 0 is equal to the moment of flow at x = L. Therefore, these cancel out.
3. Find gravity force on the shell
4. Find pressure forces
5. Plug into conservation of momentum and solve for τyx
6. Apply Newton's law of viscosity for a Newtonian fluid
τyx = -μ(dVx/dy)
7. Integrate to find equation for velocity and use Boundary Conditions to find constants of integration
Boundary 1: Top Surface: y = 0 and Vx = U
Boundary 2: Bottom Surface: y = D and Vx = 0
