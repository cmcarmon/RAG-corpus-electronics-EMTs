In Section 11.3, Active Microwave Circuits, issues relevant to
the design of the most common types of active microwave
circuits are discussed. The section ﬁrst presents the design of
microwave ampliﬁers using an S-parameter approach. Next,
microwave oscillator design is brieﬂy outlined. The stability
conditions for both one- and two-port microwave oscillators
are presented. The section concludes with a discussion on
