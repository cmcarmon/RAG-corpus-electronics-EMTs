A single pn-junction with appropriate contacts for connecting the junction to external circuits
is called a semiconductor pn-junction diode. The fundamental building block upon which all
semiconductor devices are based is the pn-junction. The most common two-terminal nonlinear
resistor is the semiconductor diode, whose symbol is shown in Figure 7.2.1(a). The terminal
voltage and current are denoted by vD and iD, respectively. The physical structure of the pn-
junction is shown in Figure 7.2.1(b). The junction is made by doping the two sides of the crystal
with different impurities. Figure 7.2.1(c) shows the voltâ€“ampere curve (or static characteristic)
of the ideal (or perfect) diode. Note that when vD is zero, iD is not and vice versa, a condition
