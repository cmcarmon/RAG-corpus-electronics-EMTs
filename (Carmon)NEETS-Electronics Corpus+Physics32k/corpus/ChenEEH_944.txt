Algorithm LMCS-1
As mentioned previously, this algorithm for solving problem
QP-3 consists of eliminating ^ll from Ml ¼ 2Bg (see equation
4.63) then computing ^ss according to equation 4.64. To deter-
mine the value of the Lagrange multipliers ^ll corresponding to
the minimization of e
t in problem QP-3, consider the linear
system:
Ml ¼ (BBt )l ¼ (I þ CCt )l ¼ 2Bg ¼ 2(g c þ Cg b),
