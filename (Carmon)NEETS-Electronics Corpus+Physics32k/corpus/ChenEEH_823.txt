The port terminals Pressure_sensor and Temp_sensor are
modeled as sources that guarantee pressure and temperature
potentials without side effects. These potentials can be gained
from the scuba diver’s position. To simplify the model, only
the resulting potentials are described in the following two
architectures. The ﬁrst is characteristic for lake diving, and
the second is aimed at ocean diving.
