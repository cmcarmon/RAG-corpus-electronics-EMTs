Test vehicle launches
The first Vanguard flight, a successful suborbital test of the Vanguard TV0 single-stage vehicle, was launched on December 8, 1956. On May 1, 1957, the two-stage test vehicle TV-1 was successfully launched. Vanguard TV-2, another successful suborbital test, was launched October 23, 1957.
The Vanguard rocket launched three satellites out of eleven launch attempts:
Vanguard TV3 - December 6, 1957 - Failed to orbit 1.36 kg (3 lb) satellite - low tank pressure caused engine cutoff T+2 seconds
Vanguard TV3 Backup - February 5, 1958 - Failed to orbit 1.36 kg (3.0 lb) satellite - control failure caused vehicle breakup T+55 seconds
Vanguard 1 - March 17, 1958 - Orbited 1.47 kg (3.2 lb) satellite
Vanguard TV5 - April 28, 1958 - Failed to orbit 9.98 kg (22.0 lb) satellite - 3rd stage separation failure
Vanguard SLV-1 - May 27, 1958 - Failed to orbit 9.98 kg (22.0 lb) satellite - 2nd stage attitude control failure prevented the 3rd stage from entering the correct angle for orbital insertion
Vanguard SLV 2 - June 26, 1958 - Failed to orbit 9.98 kg (22.0 lb) satellite - 2nd stage lost thrust after only 8 seconds of burning due to fuel line obstruction
Vanguard SLV 3 - September 26, 1958 - Failed to orbit 9.98 kg (22.0 lb) satellite - 2nd stage insufficient thrust for orbital insertion due to fuel line obstruction
Vanguard 2 - February 17, 1959 - Orbited 10.8 kg (24 lb) satellite
Vanguard SLV 5 - April 13, 1959 - Failed to orbit 10.3 kg (23 lb) 11 oz) satellite - 2nd stage hydraulics failure led to loss of control
Vanguard SLV 6 - June 22, 1959 - Failed to orbit 10.3 kg (22 lb 11 oz) satellite - 2nd stage exploded due to stuck helium vent valve
Vanguard 3 - September 18, 1959 - Orbited 22.7 kg (50 lb) satellite
