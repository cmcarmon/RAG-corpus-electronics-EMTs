(cid:1) The power supply voltage VS is 5 V.
(cid:1) RL = 100 k and RON = 10 k for each of the MOSFETs.
Equation 11.27 applies when T/2 (cid:3) RTHCL and T/2 (cid:3) RLCL. First, let us confirm
that these relationships hold. Since RL is greater than RTH,
it is sufficient to verify
that T/2 (cid:3) RLCL. For the parameters supplied, T/2 = 1/(20 × 106) = 50 ns and
RLCL = 100× 103 × 0.01× 10
−12 = 1 ns. Clearly, the circuit time constants are much
smaller than the signal intervals.
