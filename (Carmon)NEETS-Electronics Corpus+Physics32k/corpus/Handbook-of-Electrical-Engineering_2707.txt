Constructive Method
In most of the constructive methods, at each step an unplaced cell is selected and then located in the proper
area. There are different strategies for selecting a cell from the collection of unplaced cells [Wimer and Koren,
1988]. One strategy is to select the cell that is most strongly connected to already placed cells. For each unplaced
cell, we Ô¨Ånd the total of its connections to all of the already placed cells. Then we select the unplaced cell that
has the maximum number of connections. As an example consider the cells in Fig. 25.15. Assume that cells c1
and  c2 are already placed on the chip. In Fig. 25.16 we see that cell  c5 has been selected as the next cell to be
placed. This is because cell c5 has the largest number of connections (i.e., three) to cells c1 and c2.
