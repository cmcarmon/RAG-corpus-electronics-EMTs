Many DC circuits use multiple DC power supplies, 
such as +5 VDC (volts DC), +12 VDC, and even –5 VDC 
or –2 VDC, so the voltage‐source symbols in the sche-
matics are usually labeled with the nominal voltage. 
If a schematic doesn’t specify a voltage, you’re often 
(but not always!) dealing with 5 VDC. And remember: 
Unless otherwise specifically noted, the voltage in a 
schematic is almost always DC, not AC.
