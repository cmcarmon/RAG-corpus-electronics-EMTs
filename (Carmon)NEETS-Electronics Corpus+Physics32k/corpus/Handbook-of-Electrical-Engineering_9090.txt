Hardware Architecture
Year 1998 state of the art recognizes two main hardware architectures of the ICC: 8-bit and 32-bit microcon-
trollers. Why not 16-bit? Because silicon chip technology goes faster than “bits-and-bytes” maturity ﬁghts of
smart card software developers. 16-bit did not catch its historical moment, however, from time to time there
are  successful  attempts  to  re-use  this  technology.  This  statement  may  sound  strange  for  nowadays’  software
programmers used to easy “consumption” of megabytes of memory but for those who began their developer
careers in early 1980s, the mastership of putting every required functionality in magic “64k” number of bytes
must sound familiar.
