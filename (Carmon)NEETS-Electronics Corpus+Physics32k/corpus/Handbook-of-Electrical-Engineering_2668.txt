For  engineers  who  work  in  the  semiconductor  industry,  or  in  its  myriad  of  supporting  industries,  the
challenge  is  to  maintain  this  relentless  growth.  The  entire  industry  is  marching  to  a  drumbeat.  The  cost  of
technology development and the investment in plant and equipment have risen to billions of dollars. Companies
that lag behind face a serious loss of market share and, possibly, dire economic consequences.
