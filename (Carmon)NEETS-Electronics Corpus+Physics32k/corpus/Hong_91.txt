The conduction path in a MOSFET runs from drain to source. Similar to a BJT, 
when  a  MOSFET  is  in  the  off-state,  the  body-drain  and  body-source  junctions  form 
opposing  diodes  and  the  conduction  path  is  blocked.  In  a  BJT,  the  conduction  path  is 
created by introducing electrons to the middle P-type region to temporarily turn it into an 
N-type region. In a MOSFET, charges which are deposited at the gate electrode create an 
electric field in the body.  This field draws electrons into a thin layer in the body adjacent 
to the oxide layer. The excess of electrons effectively creates an N-type channel in the P-
type body, which gives a high drain-to-source conductivity.
