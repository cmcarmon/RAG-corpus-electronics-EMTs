Nonlinear Equalizers
Decision-Feedback Equalizers
A  decision-feedback  equalizer  (DFE)  is  a  simple  nonlinear  equalizer  [Monsen,  1971],  which  is  particularly
useful for channels with severe amplitude distortion and uses decision feedback to cancel the interference from
symbols which have already been detected. Fig. 70.8 shows the diagram of the equalizer.
