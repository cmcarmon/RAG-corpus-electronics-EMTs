If the intrinsic luminosity



L


{\displaystyle L}
of a distant object is known, we can calculate its luminosity distance by measuring the flux



S


{\displaystyle S}
and determine

{\displaystyle d_{L}(z)={\sqrt {L/4\pi S}}}
, which turns out to be equivalent to the expression above for

{\displaystyle d_{L}(z)}
. This quantity is important for measurements of standard candles like type Ia supernovae, which were first used to discover the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.
