FIGURE  39.12  Diagram  showing  the  struc-
ture  for  a  typical  pn  junction  IMPATT  diode.
This  particular  diode  is  called  a  double-drift
device because avalanche breakdown occurs at
the pn junction, which is located in the middle
of  the  device.  When  operated  in  breakdown,
electrons  would  travel  through  the  n-type
region towards the positive terminal of the bias
source  and  holes  would  travel  through  the  p-
type region towards the negative terminal of the
source.  The  diode,  therefore,  operates  as  two
diodes connected in a back-to-back conÔ¨Ågura-
tion.  The  frequency  capability  of  the  device  is
directly proportional to the width of the n and
p regions.
