If the hard disks were used to store classified information or unclassified but sensitive information, 
you can't de-classify the hard disks by erasing them. This is because with the right equipment and 
software, the data that was on the disk can be reconstructed. If you can't re-use the hard disks to store 
other classified data, you must sanitize or destroy them, using the procedures in OPNAVINST 5510.1.
