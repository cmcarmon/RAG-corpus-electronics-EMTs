State variable analysis or state space analysis, as it is some-
times called,
is a matrix-based approach that is used for
analysis of circuits containing time-varying elements as well
as nonlinear elements. The state of a circuit or a system
is deÔ¨Åned as a set of a minimum number of variables associ-
ated with the circuit; knowledge of these variables along
with the knowledge of the input will enable the prediction
of the currents and voltages in all system elements at any future
time.
