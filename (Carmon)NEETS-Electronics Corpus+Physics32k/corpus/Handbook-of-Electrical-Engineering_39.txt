Color Coding of Resistors
Resistors are generally identiﬁed by color coding or direct digital marking. The color code is given in Table 1.1.
The color code is commonly used in composition resistors and ﬁlm resistors. The color code essentially consists
of four bands of different colors. The ﬁrst band is the most signiﬁcant ﬁgure, the second band is the second
signiﬁcant ﬁgure, the third band is the multiplier or the number of zeros that have to be added after the ﬁrst
two signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and the fourth band is the tolerance on the resistance value. If the fourth band is not
present, the resistor tolerance is the standard 20% above and below the rated value. When the color code is
used on ﬁxed wire-wound resistors, the ﬁrst band is applied in double width.
