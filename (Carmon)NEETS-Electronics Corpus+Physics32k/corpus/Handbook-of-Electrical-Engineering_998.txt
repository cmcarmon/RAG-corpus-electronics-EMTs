BSIM Extraction Strategy in Detail
All MOS model strategies have basic features in common; namely, ﬁt the linear region at zero back-bias to get
the  basic  zero-order  parameters,  ﬁt  the  linear  region  at  nonzero  back-bias,  ﬁt  the  saturation  region  at  zero
back-bias, ﬁt the saturation region at nonzero back-bias, and then ﬁt the subthreshold region. It is possible to
extend the type of strategy we covered for level 3 to the BSIM model, but that is not the way BSIM was intended
to be used.
