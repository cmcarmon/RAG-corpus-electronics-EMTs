integration per chip is increasing, causing the total capacitance
per chip to increase. In addition, two of the main requirements
of current applications are speed and real-time operation. As
such, the frequency of operation is meant to increase drasti-
cally especially in the microprocessor area. In addition, supply
voltage is not scaled at the same rate as the device scaling for a
speciÔ¨Åc technology. From these facts, it is quite easily under-
standable that in scaling technology, the relative power is
increasing with respect to that of predecessor technologies
(refer to Figure 5.4).
