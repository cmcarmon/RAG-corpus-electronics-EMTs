The ideal mechanical advantage of a screw jack, the ratio of the force the jack exerts on the load to the input force on the lever ignoring friction is







F

load



F

in

Ï€
r

l





{\displaystyle {\frac {F_{\text{load}}}{F_{\text{in}}}}={\frac {2\pi r}{l}}\,}

where





F

load





{\displaystyle F_{\text{load}}\,}
is the force the jack exerts on the load





F

in





{\displaystyle F_{\text{in}}\,}
is the rotational force exerted on the handle of the jack




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the length of the jack handle, from the screw axis to where the force is applied




l



{\displaystyle l\,}
is the lead of the screw.
The screw jack consists of two simple machines in series; the long operating handle serves as a lever whose output force turns the screw. So the mechanical advantage is increased by a longer handle as well as a finer screw thread. However, most screw jacks have large amounts of friction which increase the input force necessary, so the actual mechanical advantage is often only 30% to 50% of this figure.
