Apodized SAW Transducers
Apodization is the most widely used method for weighting a SAW transducer. The desired time-sampled impulse
response  is  implemented  by  assigning  the  overlap  of  opposite  polarity  electrodes  at  a  given  position  to  a
normalized  sample  weight  at  a  given  time.  A  tap  having  a  weight  of  unity  has  an  overlap  across  the  entire
beamwidth while a small tap will have a small overlap of adjacent electrodes. The time impulse response can
be broken into tracks which have uniform height but whose time length and impulse response may vary. Each
of these time tracks is implemented spatially across the transducerâ€™s beamwidth by overlapped electrode sections
at  the  proper  positions.  This  is  shown  in  Fig. 47.1.  The  smaller  the  width  of  the  tracks,  the  more  exact  the
approximation  of  uniform  time  samples.  There  are  many  different  ways  to  implement  the  time-to-spatial
transformation; Fig. 47.1 shows just one such implementation.
