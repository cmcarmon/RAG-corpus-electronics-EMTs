The current land speed record of 2.9 km/s was obtained by a sled on 5 kilometers of rail track mostly in a helium-filled tunnel, in a $20 million project. The Gen-1.5 version of the StarTram for launch of passenger RLVs at 4 km/s velocity from the surface of a mountain would be significantly higher speed with a far more massive vehicle. However, such would accelerate in a lengthy vacuum tunnel without air or gas drag, with levitation preventing hypervelocity physical rail contact, and with 3 orders of magnitude higher anticipated funding. Many challenges including high initial capital cost would overlap with Gen-1, though not having the levitated launch tube of Gen-2.
