move. The voltage produced in the conductor is called 
induced voltage. The strength of the magnetic field, the 
speed with which the conductor moves through the 
magnetic field, the angle at which the conductor cuts 
the magnetic field, and the length of the conductor 
 determine the amount of induced voltage.
