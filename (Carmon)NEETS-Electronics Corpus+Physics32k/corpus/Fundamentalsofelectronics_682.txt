Example 5.8
We want to lowpass ﬁlter a signal that contains a sinusoid and a signiﬁcant amount of noise. The
example shown in Figure 5.22 shows a portion of the noisy signal’s waveform. If it weren’t for the
overlaid sinusoid, discerning the sine wave in the signal is virtually impossible. One of the primary
applications of linear ﬁlters is noise removal: preserve the signal by matching ﬁlter’s passband
with the signal’s spectrum and greatly reduce all other frequency components that may be present
in the noisy signal.
