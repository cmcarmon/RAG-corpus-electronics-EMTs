In a rotary splice, the fibers are mounted into a glass ferrule and secured with adhesives. The splice
begins as one long glass ferrule that is broken in half during the assembly process. A fiber is inserted into
each half of the tube and epoxied in place using an ultraviolet cure epoxy. The endface of the tubes are
then polished and placed together using the alignment sleeve. Figure 4-12 is an illustration of a rotary
splice. The fiber ends retain their original orientation and have added mechanical stability since each fiber
is mounted into a glass ferrule and alignment sleeve. The rotary splice may use index matching gel within
the alignment sleeve to produce low-loss splices.
