In cases where incandescent light is in use, but a high colour temperature is required, a technique called "colour temperature correction" may be used. This involves placing a "CT" light filter in front of a light source. To the naked eye this type of filter appears blue, but when put in front of an amber shifted light source it counteracts the dominant amber colours to produce a more white light through a process known as subtractive mixing.
