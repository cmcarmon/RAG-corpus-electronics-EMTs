We  can  illustrate  these  concepts  by  describing  two  ﬁrst-generation  supercomputer  disks,  the  Cray  DD-19
and  the  CDC  819  [Bucher  and  Hayes,  1980].  These  were  state-of-the-art  disks  around  1980.  Each  disk  has
40 recording surfaces (20 platters), 411 cylinders, and 18 (DD-19) or 20 (CDC 819) 512-byte sectors per track.
Both disks possess a limited “parallel read-out” capability. A given data word is actually byte interleaved over
four surfaces. Rather than a single set of read/write electronics for the actuator, these disks have four sets, so

it is possible to read or write with four heads at a time. Four heads on adjacent arms are called a 
A disk track is thus composed of the stacked recording tracks of four adjacent surfaces, and there are 10 tracks
per cylinder, spread over 40 surfaces. The advances over the last decade can be illustrated by the Cray DD-49,
which  is  a  typical  high-end  supercomputer  disk  of  today.  It  consists  of  16  recording  surfaces  (9  platters),
886 cylinders, 42 4096-byte sectors per track, with 32 read/write heads organized into eight head groups, four
groups  on  each  of  two  independent  actuators.  Each  actuator  can  sweep  the  entire  range  of  tracks,  and  by
“scheduling” the arms to position the actuator closest to the target track of the pending request, the average
seek time can be reduced. The DD-49 has a capacity of 1.2 Gbytes of storage and can transfer at a sustained
rate of 9.6 Mbytes/s.
