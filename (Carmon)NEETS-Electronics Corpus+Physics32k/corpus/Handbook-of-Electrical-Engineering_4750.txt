 refers to the permanent nature of the electric polarization in analogy
with the magnetization in the magnetic case. It does not imply the presence of iron, even though the root of
the  word  means  iron.  The  root  of  the  word  piezo  means  pressure;  hence  the  original  meaning  of  the  word
piezoelectric implied “pressure electricity”—the generation of electric ﬁeld from applied pressure. This deﬁni-
tion  ignores  the  fact  that  these  materials  are  reversible,  allowing  the  generation  of  mechanical  motion  by
applying a ﬁeld.
