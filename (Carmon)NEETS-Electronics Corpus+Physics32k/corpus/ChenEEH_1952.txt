This process is illustrated in Figure 8.8(B) for a small circuit
and for a single CS insertion for extending net n1, the CS-net.
The corresponding O-net n2 transits from T1 to T3 and bumps
into n5. The movement of n2 from T1 creates a ‘‘dynamic’’
spare node (labeled by D_Sp in the ﬁgure) for net n6, for which
information is added to the OG. The bumped net n5 then
transits from T3 to T0 where it bumps n6 and n3. Net n6 then
transits to the above dynamically created spare on T1, while n3
transits to its spare node on T2. Thus, a converging T-DAG
(here a tree) is determined in the OG. The transition arcs are
shown dark in Figure 8.8(B) and numbered chronologically in
the order in which they are traversed in the search process.
After every transition, the track labels of the nodes and those of
their edges need to be updated.
