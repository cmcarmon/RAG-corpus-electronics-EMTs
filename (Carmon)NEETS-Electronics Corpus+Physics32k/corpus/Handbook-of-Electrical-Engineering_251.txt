KCL for the node between C2 and R1 can be written to eliminate variables and lead to a solution describing
the capacitor voltages. The capacitor voltages, together with the applied voltage source, determine the remaining
voltages and currents in the circuit. Nodal analysis (see Section 3.2) treats the systematic modeling and analysis
of a circuit under the inï¬‚uence of its sources and energy storage elements.
