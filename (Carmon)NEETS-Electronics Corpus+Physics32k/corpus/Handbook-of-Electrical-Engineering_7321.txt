Others will be processed by the loop error function [Eq. (76.3)] that is a high-pass characteristic. Table 76.1
shows the major sources of noise in a PLL and the effect of the loop dynamics on this noise. All these factors must
be combined to evaluate the complete noise performance of a PLL. Often it will be found that one particular noise
source will be dominant and the PLL performance can then be adjusted to minimize the output noise.
