A linear induction motor (LIM) is essentially a conventional induction motor with its primary "unwound" and laid out flat. The rotor, normally consisting of a series of conductors wound onto a form of some sort, is replaced by a sheet of magnetically susceptible metal. Due to its good conductance to weight ratio, aluminium is almost always used for this "stator plate". When the primaries are fed current, they induce a magnetic field in the stator plate, which generates forces away from the plate and along it.
The simplest way to use these forces to produce linear motion is to arrange two such motors on either side of a single stator plate. That way the lift forces from one motor are opposite of the other, and clamping the two motors together results in there being no net sideways force (it is contained in the stress of the clamp). This is normally arranged in a C-shaped device which is hung above a vertical stator plate. Arrangements of this sort can be commonly seen on many pioneering transit systems from the 1960s, normally running through a slot in the middle of the vehicle floor.
By the late 1960s, a fatal flaw in this "sandwich motor" arrangement had been discovered. The stator plate cannot be made of a single casting, as it is kilometres long. Instead, it is made of many smaller plates that are then welded together. The strength of these welds is much smaller than the plate itself, and are prone to breaking in cold weather. When the vehicle passes, any misalignment between the motor and the stator results in enormous forces being generated, pushing the plate back into the center of the motor. These forces may be great enough to break the welds between the plates, or simply deform them. In this case, a motor on a following vehicle can strike the plate, catastrophically.
