clustering for Gaussian mixture model formation for continu-
ous-observation HMMs. In each case, the K-means algorithm
(Deller et al., 2000; Devijver and Kittler, 1982) is ordinarily
used. In this popular method, the initial measurements are
subdivided into K distinct groups. The average feature vector,
or centroid in each group is used as the exemplar feature for
that group. The entire population of measurements is then
assigned to the group to which it is closest according to the
similarity measure used. The centroids are recomputed. The
process is repeated until no measurement changes classes.
