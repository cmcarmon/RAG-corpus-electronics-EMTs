The switch at the end of the bus replaces the source address with the destination address and transmits the
packet on the broadcast bus, where the appropriate module records the destination address and sends the packet
to the remote station over the Ô¨Åber link. Because the switch establishes a correspondence between source and
destination at the beginning of a session (as in a circuit switch), source modules need not know the bus position
of destination modules. The switch has a directory of positions and terminal names.
