Lightning-Overhead Wire Interactions
General
Lightning interactions with overhead wires such as power distribution lines are a major source of electromag-
netic compatibility problems, resulting in inferior power quality, power outages, and damaged electronics. Only
a  small  fraction  of  all  the  cloud-to-ground  lightning  ﬂashes  directly  strike  overhead  lines,  making  induced
overvoltages a signiﬁcant source of power disturbances. This section begins with a discussion of the appropriate
transmission line equations. Then, examples of measured lightning-induced voltages on overhead lines as well
as calculated voltages are presented.
