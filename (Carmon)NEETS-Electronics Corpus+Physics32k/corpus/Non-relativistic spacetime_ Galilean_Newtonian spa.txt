The classic example of a non-relativistic spacetime is the spacetime of Galileo and Newton. It is the spacetime of everyday "common sense". Galilean/Newtonian spacetime assumes that space is Euclidean (i.e. "flat"), and that time has a constant rate of passage that is independent of the state of motion of an observer, or indeed of anything external.
Newtonian mechanics takes place within the context of Galilean/Newtonian spacetime. For a huge problem set, the results of computations using Newtonian mechanics are only imperceptibly different from computations using a relativistic model. Since computations using Newtonian mechanics are considerably simpler than those using relativistic mechanics, as well as correspond to intuition, most everyday mechanics problems are solved using Newtonian mechanics.
