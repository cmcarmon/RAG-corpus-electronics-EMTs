Noise ﬁgure:  A measure of the noise added by a network to an RF signal passing through it. Noise ﬁgure can
be deﬁned in terms of signal-to-noise ratios at the input and output ports of the network. Noise ﬁgure
is generally measured in decibels and can be deﬁned as F (dB) = 10 log[(S/N)in/(S/N)out].
