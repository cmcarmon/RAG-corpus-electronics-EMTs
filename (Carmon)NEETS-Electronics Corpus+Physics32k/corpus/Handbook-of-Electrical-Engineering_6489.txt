AM-VSB Video
The  video  format  of  choice,  both  for  broadcast  and  cable  television  distribution,  is AM-VSB.  Each  channel
consists  of  an  RF  carrier  that  is  amplitude  modulated  (AM)  by  video  information.  Single-sideband  vestigial
(VSB) Ô¨Åltering is used to minimize the bandwidth of the modulated spectrum. The resultant RF spectrum is
dominated by the remaining RF carrier, which is reduced by typically 5.6 dB by the AM, and contains relatively
low-level signal information, including audio and color subcarriers. An AM-VSB channel requires a bandwidth
of only 6 MHz, but CNRs must be at least 50 dB.
