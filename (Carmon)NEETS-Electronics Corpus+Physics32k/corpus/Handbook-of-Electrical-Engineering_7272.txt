As one might expect, 18-GHz radio waves exhibit a blend of the characteristics of UHF frequencies below
them and IR light above them. For example, 18-GHz waves act like light and unlike radio in that they are blocked
and reﬂected by large structures such as concrete and steel. Reﬂecting back and forth would allow them to ﬁll
an area deﬁned by concrete ﬂoors and walls with only very small amounts of transmitted power, yet not pass
beyond. They also refract like light, penetrating tiny holes and cracks such as closed doors to diffuse and spread
through the space beyond. What little radio signal that might escape the microcell would be rapidly dissipated.
Also, unlike lower frequency radio, 18-GHz radio is of a high enough frequency that not only ofﬁce equipment
but even high-energy factory equipment and processes do not interfere with it. Likewise, with its high-frequency
and low-required transmitted power, the 18-GHz signals themselves from such a system would not interfere
with  other  electronic  systems  or  equipment.  On  the  other  hand,  like  radio  and  unlike  light,  18-GHz  signals
still can pass through less dense materials such as drywall and interior ofﬁce separators and, combined with
their  reﬂectivity,  are  thus  not  subject  to  “line-of-sight”  limitations.  They  can  also  be  modulated  to  carry
information just as traditional radio signals are. Finally, since antenna size and design are largely a function of
wavelength,  which  decreases  as  frequency  increases,  the  antennas  for  the  16-mm  wavelengths  of  an  18-GHz
radio system would be relatively small and compact.
