The frequency effect on resistance varies with the resistor construction. Wire-wound resistors typically exhibit
an  increase  in  their  impedance  with  frequency.  In  composition  resistors  the  capacitances  are  formed  by  the
many conducting particles which are held in contact by a dielectric binder. The ac impedance for ﬁlm resistors

ﬁlm  resistors,  the  decrease  in  dc  resistance  at  higher  frequencies  decreases  with  increase  in  resistance.  Film
resistors have the most stable high-frequency performance.
