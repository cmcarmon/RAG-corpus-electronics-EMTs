Ceramic Capacitors
Ceramic  capacitors  are  used  most  often  for  bypass  and  coupling  applications  (Fig.  1.11).  Ceramic  capacitors
can be produced with a variety of  K values (dielectric constant). A high  K value translates to small size and
less stability. High-K capacitors with a dielectric constant >3000 are physically small and have values between
0.001 to several microfarads.
