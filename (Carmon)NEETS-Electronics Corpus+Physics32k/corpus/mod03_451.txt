sure to "tag out" the switch to ensure that power is not applied to the circuit while you are working. When
work has been completed, power must be restored to the circuit. This will allow you to check the proper
operation of the circuit and place it back in service. After the circuit has been checked for proper
operation, remove the tag from the power switch.
