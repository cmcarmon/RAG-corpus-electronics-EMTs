Gravity appeared in Robert Kirkman's "League of Losers" storyline in Marvel Team-Up vol.3 #15-18 (2006). A group of heroes including Gravity, Darkhawk, Dagger, Ara√±a, X-23, Sleepwalker, and Terror travel to the future to stop the villainous Chronok from stealing Reed Richards' time machine, thus preventing him from travelling to the present and killing all the heroes of Earth. During this time, Gravity sparks a relationship with X-23. With the help of Mutant 2099, a native of the future timeline, the group is able to defeat Chronok. However, they are unable to travel back to their original timeline and are forced to remain in the future. Gravity and the rest of the group accept their fate and take peace in the knowledge that they have saved the world, even if their sacrifice goes unnoticed.
