In figure 3-3 at time zero (T0) both input signals are at 0 volts. The output signal is also at 0 volts.
Between time zero (T0) and time one (T1), input signal number one goes positive and input signal
number two goes negative. Each of these voltage changes causes an increase in the base-to-emitter bias
which causes current through Q1 to increase. Increased current through Q1 results in a greater voltage
drop across the collector load (R3) which causes the output signal to go negative.
