Solution 
 
The reactance of the inductor will be given by: 
 
XL = 20 × 400 × 100 × 10@3 = 251 F
The  r.m.s.  voltage  developed  across  the  inductor 
will be given by: 
 
VL = IL × XL = 20 mA × 251 F = 5.02 V 
 
In this example, it is important to note that we have 
assumed  that  the  d.c.  resistance  of  the  inductor  is 
negligible by comparison with its reactance. Where 
this is not the case, it will be necessary to determine 
the  impedance  of  the  component  and  use  this  to 
determine the voltage drop.
