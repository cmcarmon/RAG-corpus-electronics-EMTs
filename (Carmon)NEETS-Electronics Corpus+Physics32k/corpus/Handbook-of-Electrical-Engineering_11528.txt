Second, because of the use of invasive medical procedures, many patients are considered to be “electrically
susceptible.” Under certain conditions, electrical currents on the order of microamperes can cause ventricular
ﬁbrillation, a potentially fatal disruption of normal cardiac function. Therefore, the NFPA and other organi-
zations have established strict standards for grounding, “leakage” current, and other electrical parameters. These
standards apply to devices and cabling in patient-care locations of the hospital.
