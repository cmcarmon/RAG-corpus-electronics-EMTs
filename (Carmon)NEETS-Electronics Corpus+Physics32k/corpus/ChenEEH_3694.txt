Further topics related to lattice structures and reﬂection
coefﬁcients include formulations that compute reﬂection coef-
ﬁcients independently of the LP parameters (Itakura and Saito,
1969; Burg, 1967) sets of parameters that are related to, or are
transformations of, reﬂection coefﬁcients (Deller et al., 2000;
Viswanathan and Makhoul, 1975; and Itakura, 1975); and
more efﬁcient lattice structures (Makhoul, 1977; Strobach,
1991).
