Since at least the middle ages, the earth was perceived as eternal, unchanging and of symmetrical shape (close to a sphere), so it was natural that some fractional measure of its surface should be proposed as a standard of length. But first, scientific information about the shape and size of the earth had to be obtained.
In 1669, Jean Picard, a French astronomer, was the first person to accurately measure the size of the earth. In a survey spanning one degree of latitude, he erred by only .44%
In Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1686), Isaac Newton gave a theoretical explanation for the "bulging equator" which also explained the differences found in the lengths of the "second pendulums", theories that were confirmed by the Académie's expedition to Peru in 1735.
