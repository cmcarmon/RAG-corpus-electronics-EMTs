The indicator sweep voltage shown in figure 2-1 is initiated at the same time the transmitter is
triggered. In other applications, it may be more desirable to delay the timing trigger pulse that is to be fed
to the indicator sweep circuit. Delaying the trigger pulse will initiate the indicator sweep after a pulse is
transmitted.
