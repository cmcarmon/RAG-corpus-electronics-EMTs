The operation of a JFET requires two external bias 
voltages. One of the voltage sources (EDS) is connected 
between the source and the drain, forcing the current 
to flow through the channel. The other voltage source 
(EGS) is connected between the gate and the source. 
It controls the amount of current flowing through 
the channel. Figure 32-3 shows a properly biased 
 N-channel JFET.
