Since the total resistance of a parallel circuit is smaller than any of the individual resistors, total
resistance of a parallel circuit is not the sum of the individual resistor values as was the case in a series
circuit. The total resistance of resistors in parallel is also referred to as EQUIVALENT RESISTANCE
(Req). The terms total resistance and equivalent resistance are used interchangeably.
