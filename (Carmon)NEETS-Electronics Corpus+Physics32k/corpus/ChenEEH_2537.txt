. Bandwidth refers to the operating bandwidth of a hybrid
or directional coupler when its coupling factor, isolation,
and input VSWR all satisfy the prescribed speciﬁcations.
Generally, the single-section coupler (typically on the
order of 10% for a branch-line hybrid) does not provide
sufﬁcient bandwidth. Bandwidth limitations, however,
can easily be overcome by multisection designs that com-
bine a number of single-section coupling cells.
