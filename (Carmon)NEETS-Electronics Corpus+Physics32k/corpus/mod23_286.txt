Phase response is the expression of the variation of the phase shift with respect to frequency. A good
magnetic tape recorder will have linearly increasing phase response as frequency increases. In simpler
terms, good phase response shows that a magnetic recorder can reproduce a complex waveform (such as a
square wave which has an infinite number of sine waves) without distorting it. Figure 6-6 shows both
good and bad phase response.
