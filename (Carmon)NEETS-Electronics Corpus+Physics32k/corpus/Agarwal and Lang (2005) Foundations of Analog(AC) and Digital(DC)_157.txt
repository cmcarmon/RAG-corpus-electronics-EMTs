Equation 1.4 implies a specific relation between reference directions chosen for
voltage and current. This relation is shown explicitly in Figure 1.19: the arrow
that defines the positive flow of current (flow of positive charge) is directed in at
the resistor terminal assigned to be positive in voltage. This convention, referred
to as associated variables, is generalized to an arbitrary element in Figure 1.20
and will be followed whenever possible in this text. The variables v and i are
called the terminal variables for the element. Note that the values of each of
these variables may be positive or negative depending on the actual direction
of current flow or the actual polarity of the voltage.
