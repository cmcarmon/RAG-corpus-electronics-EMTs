The current coil of the wattmeter is connected in series with the circuit (load), and the voltage coil is
connected across the line. When line current flows through the current coil of a wattmeter, a field is set up
around the coil. The strength of this field is in phase with and proportional to the line current. The voltage
coil of the wattmeter generally has a high-resistance resistor connected in series with it. The purpose for
this connection is to make the voltage-coil circuit of the meter as purely resistive as possible. As a result,
current in the voltage circuit is practically in phase with line voltage. Therefore, when voltage is
