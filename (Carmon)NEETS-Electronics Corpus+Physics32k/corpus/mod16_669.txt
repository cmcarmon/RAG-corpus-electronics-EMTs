Switching is controlled by a high-frequency multivibrator in the CHOP mode. That is, the gate
selects the output of one channel and then the other at a high-frequency rate (1200 kilohertz in most
oscilloscopes). Because the switching time is very short in a good-quality oscilloscope, the resultant
display is two sets of horizontally dashed lines, as shown in figure 6-37, view A.
