Environmental considerations are not, of course, the only forces driving the technological evolution in the
electronics industry. Major driving forces, as always, also include price, cost, performance, and market/regula-
tory  requirements.  However,  to  the  extent  that  the  trend  is  toward  smaller  devices,  fewer  processing  steps,
increased automation, and higher performance per device, such evolution will likely have a positive environ-
mental  impact  at  the  unit  production  level,  i.e.,  less  materials,  less  chemicals,  less  waste  related  to  each  unit
produced.  Technology  advances  that  have  environmental  implications  at  the  upstream  processing  stage  may
well have signiﬁcant beneﬁts in the later stages of systems development and production. For example, material
substitution in early production stages may decrease waste implications throughout the entire process. Since
both semiconductors and printed wiring boards are produced in high volume and are present in virtually all
electronic  products  ranging  from  electronic  appliances,  to  computers,  automotive,  aerospace,  and  military
applications, we will brieﬂy examine the impact of these two areas of the electronic industry.
