Wet sintered-anode capacitors, or “wet-slug” tantalum capacitors, are used where low dc leakage is required.
The  conventional “silver  can”  design  will  not  tolerate  reverse  voltage.  In  military  or  aerospace  applications
where utmost reliability is desired, tantalum cases are used instead of silver cases. The tantalum-cased wet-slug
units withstand up to 3 V reverse voltage and operate under higher ripple currents and at temperatures up to
200(cid:176)C (392(cid:176)F).
