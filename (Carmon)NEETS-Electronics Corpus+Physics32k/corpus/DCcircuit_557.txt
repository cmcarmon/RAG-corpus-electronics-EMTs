The fact that this circuit is parallel instead of series has nothing to do with the validity of
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law. For that matter, the circuit could be a ”black box” – its component
conﬁguration completely hidden from our view, with only a set of exposed terminals for us to
measure voltage between – and KVL would still hold true:
