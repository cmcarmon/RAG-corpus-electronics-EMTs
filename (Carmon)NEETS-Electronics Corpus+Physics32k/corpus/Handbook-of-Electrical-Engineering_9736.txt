Early computer connects were made at 56 bits per second (56 bps). As the speed of machine and systems
improved,  rates  of  transmission  have  increased  to  kilobits  (kbs),  megabits  (mps),  gigabits  (gbs),  and  so  on.
Early  modems  operated  at  14.4  kbs  (14,000 bps),  more  modern  modems  function  at  28.8  kbs  (28,800  bps).
 lines that can now be installed
Higher capacity “pipelines” include 
  connections  (a  technology  that  can  connect
at  home  or  business  that  operate  at  56 kbs,  direct 
T-3
computers at a 10 Mbps). Higher capacity lines such as 
lines are now being used for extremely high capacity systems. The T-1 and higher lines are very expensive to
install and maintain but offer extremely quick Internet work speed.
