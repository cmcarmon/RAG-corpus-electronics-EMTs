The next step is to label all voltage drop polarities across resistors according to the assumed
directions of the mesh currents. Remember that the “upstream” end of a resistor will always
be negative, and the “downstream” end of a resistor positive with respect to each other, since
electrons are negatively charged. The battery polarities, of course, are dictated by their symbol
orientations in the diagram, and may or may not “agree” with the resistor polarities (assumed
current directions):
