Audio amplifiers are divided into two categories: 
voltage amplifiers and power amplifiers. Volt-
age amplifiers are primarily used to produce a high 
voltage gain. Power amplifiers are used to deliver a 
large amount of power to a load. For example, a volt-
age amplifier is typically used to increase the voltage 
level of a signal sufficiently to drive a power ampli-
fier. The power amplifier then supplies a high output 
to drive a load such as a loudspeaker or other high-
power device. Typically, voltage amplifiers are biased 
to operate as class A amplifiers, and power amplifiers 
are  biased to operate as class B amplifiers.
