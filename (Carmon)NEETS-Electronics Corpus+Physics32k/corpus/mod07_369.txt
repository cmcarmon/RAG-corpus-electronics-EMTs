Another type of MOSFET is the induced-channel type MOSFET. Unlike the MOSFETs discussed so 
far, the induced-channel type has no actual channel between the source and the drain. The induced 
channel MOSFET is constructed by making the channel of the same type material as the substrate, or the 
opposite of the source and the drain material. As shown in figure 3-56, the source and the drain are of 
P-type material, and the channel and the substrate are of N-type material.
