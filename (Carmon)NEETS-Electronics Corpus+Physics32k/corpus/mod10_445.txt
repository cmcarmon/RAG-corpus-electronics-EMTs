A transmission line has the properties of inductance, capacitance, and resistance just as the more
conventional circuits have. Usually, however, the constants in conventional circuits are lumped into a
single device or component. For example, a coil of wire has the property of inductance. When a certain
amount of inductance is needed in a circuit, a coil of the proper dimensions is inserted. The inductance of
the circuit is lumped into the one component. Two metal plates separated by a small space, can be used to
supply the required capacitance for a circuit. In such a case, most of the capacitance of the circuit is
lumped into this one component. Similarly, a fixed resistor can be used to supply a certain value of circuit
resistance as a lumped sum. Ideally, a transmission line would also have its constants of inductance,
capacitance, and resistance lumped together, as shown in figure 3-9. Unfortunately, this is not the case.
Transmission line constants are distributed, as described below.
