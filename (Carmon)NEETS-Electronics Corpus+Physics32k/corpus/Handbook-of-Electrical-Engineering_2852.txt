The  previous  discussion  of  lead  properties  of  course  does  not  apply  to  leadless  devices  such  as  Leadless
Ceramic Chip Carriers (LCCCs). Design teams using these and similar packages must understand the better
heat transfer properties of the alumina used in ceramic packages, and must match TCEs between the LCCC
and the substrate, since there are no leads to bend and absorb mismatches of expansion.
