When electrical current ï¬‚ows into a capacitor, a force is established between two parallel plates separated by
a dielectric. This energy is stored and remains even after the input is removed. By connecting a conductor (a
resistor, hard wire, or even air) across the capacitor, the charged capacitor can regain electron balance, that is,
discharge its stored energy.
