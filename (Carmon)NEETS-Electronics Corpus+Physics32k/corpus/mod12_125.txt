Most mopa transmitters have only one tube amplifier in the power-amplifier stage. However, the 
oscillator may not produce sufficient power to drive a power-amplifier tube to the power output level 
required for the antenna. In such cases, the power-amplifier stages are designed to use two or more 
amplifiers which can be driven by the oscillator. Two or more amplifiers can be connected in parallel 
(with similar elements of each tube connected) or in a push-pull arrangement. In a push-pull amplifier, the 
grids are fed equal rf voltages that are 180 degrees out of phase.
