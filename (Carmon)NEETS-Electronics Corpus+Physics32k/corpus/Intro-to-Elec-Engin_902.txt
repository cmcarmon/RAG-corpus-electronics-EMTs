where V1, V2, E1, and E2 are the rms values of v1, v2, e1, and e2, respectively, and a stands for the
turns ratio. When a passive external load circuit is connected to the secondary winding terminals,
the terminal voltage v2 will cause a current i2 to ï¬‚ow, as shown in Figure 11.3.1. Further, we have
