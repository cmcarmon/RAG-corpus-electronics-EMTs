Description: "A fall starts with the detachment of soil or rock from a steep slope along a surface on which little or no shear displacement takes place. The material then descends mainly through the air by falling, bouncing, or rolling" (Varnes, 1996).
Secondary falls: "Secondary falls involves rock bodies already physically detached from cliff and merely lodged upon it" (Hutchinson, 1988)
Speed: from very to extremely rapid
Type of slope: slope angle 45â€“90 degrees
Control factor: Discontinuities
Causes: Vibration, undercutting, differential weathering, excavation, or stream erosion
