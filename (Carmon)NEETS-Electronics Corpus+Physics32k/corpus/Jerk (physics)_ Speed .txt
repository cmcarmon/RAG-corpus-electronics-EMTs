v


{\displaystyle v}
, magnitude of the first derivative
A particle moving in a viscous fluid environment experiences a drag force




F

D




{\displaystyle F_{D}}
, which, depending on the Reynolds number and its area, ranges from being proportional to



v


{\displaystyle v}
up to being proportional to

{\displaystyle F_{D}={\tfrac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}C_{D}A,}

where




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid,




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the speed of the object relative to the fluid,




A


{\displaystyle A}
is the cross-sectional area,





C

D




{\displaystyle C_{D}}
is the drag coefficient – a dimensionless number.
The drag coefficient depends on the scalable shape of the object and on the Reynolds number, which itself depends on the speed.
