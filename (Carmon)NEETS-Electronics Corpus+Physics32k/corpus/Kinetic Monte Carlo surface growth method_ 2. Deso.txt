When atoms land on a surface, there are two possibilities. First, they would diffuse on the surface and find other atoms to make a cluster, which will be discussed below. Second, they could come off of the surface or so-called desorption process. The desorption is describe exactly as in the absorption process, with the exception of a different activation energy barrier.
Aout = Ao outexp (-Ea out/kT)
For example, if all positions on the surface of the crystal are energy equivalent, the rate of growth can be calculated from Turnbull formula:
Vc = h*Co (Aout - Ao out) = h*Coexp (-Ea in/kT) * (1 - exp(-∆G/kT))
where, ∆G = Ein – Eout, Aout, Ao out are frequencies to go in or out of crystal for any given molecule on the surface, h - height of the molecule in the growth direction, Co concentration of the molecules in direct distance from the surface.
