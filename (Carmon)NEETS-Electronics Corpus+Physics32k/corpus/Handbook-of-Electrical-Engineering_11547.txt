The preceding discussion primarily considers the high frequency limitations of FDTD calculations, which
are  based  on  the  size  of  the  object  in  wavelengths.  The  low  frequency  limitation  is  usually  determined  by  a
combination  of  the  geometry  features  and  time  step.  For  example,  consider  applying  FDTD  for  a  60-Hz
calculation for a human body. Based on the wavelength, the FDTD cells could be huge, but then the body shape
would be unrecognizable. Suppose that we pick FDTD cells of 10 cm to at least make a crude body shape. Then
 s. If we further assume that we need to make FDTD calculations
the maximum time step would be 19.2 
for  at  least  one  period  of  the  sine  wave  in  order  to  read  some  semblance  of  steady  state,  this  would  require
about 86 million time steps, which is not feasible on current computers. This illustrates the difﬁculty of using
FDTD for extremely low frequencies. For these very low frequencies other methods, such as ﬁnite elements,
are preferred.
