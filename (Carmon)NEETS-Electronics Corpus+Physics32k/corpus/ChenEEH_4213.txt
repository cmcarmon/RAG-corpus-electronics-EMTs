Nonpersistent CSMA
In nonpersistent CSMA, if a frame is waiting for transmission,
a station checks if the medium is idle and transmits the frame
right away if the medium is idle. If the medium is busy, the
station waits for a random amount of time and then repeats
the same procedure to check if the medium is idle. The algo-
rithm can reduce the possibility collisions, but there is waste
due to the idle time.
