Successful adaptation of online neural controllers in many cases requires careful and substantial design effort.
One  of  the  common  practices  is  to  pre-train  a  neural  controller  ofﬂine,  based  on  some  simpliﬁed  design
methods, in the same way that a PI controller is designed based on approximated system models that can provide
reasonable control performance, before putting the neural controller for online ﬁne-tuning [Chow and Menozzi,
1993;  Chow  and  Teeter,  1995;  Teeter  et al.,  1996].  This  approach,  as  shown  in  Fig. 100.56,  can  speed  up  the
neural  controller  online  adaptation  process  and  increase  the  closed-loop  online  adaptation  stability  because
the initial weights of the neural controller are much closer to the optimal ﬁnal weights (if they exist) after the
pre-training process. By learning online, the ANN controller can adapt to changing operating environments.
This chapter section brieﬂy describes the feedforward net paradigm to facilitate the discussion of the neural
observer and neural controller concepts in later sections. An example of using neural control for an HVAC system
will then be provided to demonstrate its effectiveness for solving real-world problems.
