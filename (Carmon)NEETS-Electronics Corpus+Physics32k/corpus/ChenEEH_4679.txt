A 4.6 L Ford V-8 fuel injected engine is used in this work. The
engine has been removed from the vehicle and mounted on an
engine test stand. The data is processed using a TMS320C30
digital signal processing (DSP) system, and two sensors are
available for engine speed measurements. An optical encoder
provides an analog pulse every two crankshaft degrees, while a
ﬂywheel sensor outputs a sinusoidal signal with a peak every
crankshaft degree. The output of the optical encoder is used as
a ‘‘clock’’ for the data sampling, and the output of the ﬂywheel
sensor provides the value of the engine speed.
