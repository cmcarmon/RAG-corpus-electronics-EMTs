The power subsystem comprises batteries and a solar array. The solar array must provide enough power to
drive  the  communications  electronics  as  well  as  the  housekeeping  functions  and  it  must  also  have  enough
capacity to charge the batteries that power the satellite during eclipse, that is, when it is shadowed and receives
no power from the sun [Richharia, 1995, p. 39]. Typical battery technology uses nickel-hydrogen cells, which
can provide a power density of more than 50 W-h/kg. Silicon solar cells can yield more than 170 W/m2 at a
satelliteâ€™s  beginning  of  life  (BOL).  Gallium  arsenide  solar  cells  (GaAs)  yield  more  than  210 W/m2.  However,
they are more expensive than silicon cells.
