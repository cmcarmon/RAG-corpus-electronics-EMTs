The electric current generated by power plants fluctuates, or changes 
direction, at a regular rate known as the frequency. In the United States and 
Canada, that rate is 60 times per second, or 60 hertz (abbreviated Hz), but in 
most European countries, AC is generated at 50 Hz. The electricity supplied 
by your average wall outlet is said to be 120 volts AC (or 120 VAC), which just 
means itâ€™s alternating current at 120 volts.
