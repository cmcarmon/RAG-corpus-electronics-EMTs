When the magnetron is adjusted to the cutoff, or critical value of the plate current, and the electrons 
just fail to reach the plate in their circular motion, it can produce oscillations at microwave frequencies. 
These oscillations are caused by the currents induced electrostatically by the moving electrons. The 
frequency is determined by the time it takes the electrons to travel from the cathode toward the plate and 
back again. A transfer of microwave energy to a load is made possible by connecting an external circuit 
between the cathode and the plate of the magnetron. Magnetron oscillators are divided into two classes: 
NEGATIVE-RESISTANCE and ELECTRON-RESONANCE MAGNETRON OSCILLATORS.
