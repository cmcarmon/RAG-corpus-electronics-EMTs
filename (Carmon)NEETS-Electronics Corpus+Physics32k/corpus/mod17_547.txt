Limitations of a satellite communications system are determined by the technical characteristics of 
the satellite and its orbital parameters. Active communications satellite systems are limited by two things. 
Satellite transmitter power on the down links and receiver sensitivity on the up links. Some early 
communications satellites have been limited by low-gain antennas.
