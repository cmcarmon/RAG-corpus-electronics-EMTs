Assuming negligible dc emitter current crowding and lE  bE,
the distributed charging of the capacitances can be represented
by a distributed RC network. The solution of the correspond-
ing linear differential equation yields an inﬁnite series for the
admittance as a function of frequency. Truncating after the ﬁrst
frequency term leads to the impedance:
