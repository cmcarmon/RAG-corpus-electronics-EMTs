Series Resistances
Both the neutral regions (see Figure 5.1) and the contacts
themselves have a ﬁnite resistivity, which results in additional
parasitic series resistances. Physically, these can be expressed
by the sheet resistances of the (access) regions as well as the
area-speciﬁc contact resistances and the dimensions of the
corresponding regions and contacts, respectively.
