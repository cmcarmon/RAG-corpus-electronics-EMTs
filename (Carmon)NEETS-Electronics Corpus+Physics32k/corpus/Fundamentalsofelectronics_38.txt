Problem 1.2: Modems
The word “modem” is short for “modulator-demodulator.” Modems are used not only for connecting com-
puters to telephone lines, but also for connecting digital (discrete-valued) sources to generic channels. In this
problem, we explore a simple kind of modem, in which binary information is represented by the presence or
absence of a sinusoid (presence representing a “1” and absence a “0”). Consequently, the modem’s transmitted
signal that represents a single bit has the form
