(g) The linear model of a common-emitter BJT
ampliﬁer shown in Figure P8.5.6(e) is appli-
cable at low frequencies. Obtain an expression
for the current gain AI l = I2/IS in terms of
AIm and ωl, where ωl corresponds to 0.707AIm
on the frequency response curve, and ωl iden-
tiﬁes the lower end of the useful bandwidth of
the ampliﬁer.
