c, for which the z-directed vector D ﬁeld
along the axis is known. Every such ring is located at the
primed coordinate (0,0,0), whereas the observation point is
at (0,0,h). Then, the differential charge is dq ¼ s2pr0
c, and
every element is again at the same distance h from the obser-
vation point. Because each elementary ring charge has a differ-
ent radius, the following integral must be performed:
