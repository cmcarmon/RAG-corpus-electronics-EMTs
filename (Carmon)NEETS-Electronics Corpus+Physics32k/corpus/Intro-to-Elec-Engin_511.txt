The K map provides an immediate view of the values of the function in graphical form.
Note that the arrangement of the cells in the K map is such that any two adjacent cells contain
minterms that vary only in one variable. Consider the map to be continuously wrapping around
itself, as if the top and bottom, and right and left, edges were touching each other. For an n-variable
map, there will be n minterms adjacent to any given minterm. For example, in Figure 6.1.14, the
cell corresponding to m2 is adjacent to the cells corresponding to m3, m6, m0, and m10. It can be
veriÔ¨Åed that any two adjacent cells contain minterms that vary only in one variable. The m2 cell,
