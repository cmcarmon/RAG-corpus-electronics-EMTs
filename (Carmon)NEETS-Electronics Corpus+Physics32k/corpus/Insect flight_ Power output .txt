In the calculation of the power used in hovering, the examples used neglected the kinetic energy of the moving wings. The wings of insects, light as they are, have a finite mass; therefore, as they move they possess kinetic energy. Because the wings are in rotary motion, the maximum kinetic energy during each wing stroke is:




K
E

I

ω

{\displaystyle KE={\frac {1}{2}}I\omega _{\text{max}}^{2}}

Here I is the moment of inertia of the wing and ωmax is the maximum angular velocity during the wing stroke. To obtain the moment of inertia for the wing, we will assume that the wing can be approximated by a thin rod pivoted at one end. The moment of inertia for the wing is then:




I
=

ℓ

{\displaystyle I={\frac {m\ell ^{2}}{3}}}

Where l is the length of the wing (1 cm) and m is the mass of two wings, which may be typically 10−3 g. The maximum angular velocity, ωmax, can be calculated from the maximum linear velocity, νmax, at the center of the wing:

{\displaystyle \omega _{\text{max}}={\frac {v_{\text{max}}}{\ell /2}}}

During each stroke the center of the wings moves with an average linear velocity νav given by the distance d traversed by the center of the wing divided by the duration Δt of the wing stroke. From our previous example, d=0.57 cm and Δt=4.5×10−3 s. Therefore:

{\displaystyle v_{av}={\frac {d}{\Delta t}}={\frac {0.57}{4.5\times 10^{-3}}}=127{\text{cm/s}}}

The velocity of the wings is zero both at the beginning and at the end of the wing stroke, meaning the maximum linear velocity is higher than the average velocity. If we assume that the velocity varies sinusoidally along the wing path, the maximum velocity is twice as high as the average velocity. Therefore, the maximum angular velocity is:





ω

{\displaystyle \omega _{\text{max}}={\frac {254}{\ell /2}}}

{\displaystyle KE={\frac {1}{2}}I\omega _{max}^{2}=\left(10^{-3}{\frac {\ell ^{2}}{3}}\right)\left({\frac {254}{\ell /2}}\right)^{2}=43{\text{ erg}}}

Since there are two wing strokes (the upstroke and downstroke) in each cycle of the wing movement, the kinetic energy is 2×43=86 erg. This is about as much energy as is consumed in hovering itself.
