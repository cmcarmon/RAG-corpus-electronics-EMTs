Whether a polymer is flexible or not depends on the scale of interest. For example, the persistence length of double-stranded DNA is about 50 nm. Looking at length scale smaller than 50 nm (Known as the McGuinness limit), it behaves more or less like a rigid rod. At length scale much larger than 50 nm, it behaves like a flexible chain. Reptation is the thermal motion of very long linear, entangled macromolecules in polymer melts or concentrated polymer solutions. Derived from the word reptile, reptation suggests the movement of entangled polymer chains as being analogous to snakes slithering through one another. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes introduced (and named) the concept of reptation into polymer physics in 1971 to explain the dependence of the mobility of a macromolecule on its length. Reptation is used as a mechanism to explain viscous flow in an amorphous polymer.  Sir Sam Edwards and Masao Doi later refined reptation theory. The consistent theory of thermal motion of polymers was given be Vladimir Pokrovskii . Similar phenomena also occur in proteins.
