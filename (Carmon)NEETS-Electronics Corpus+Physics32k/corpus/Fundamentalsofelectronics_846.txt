Digital channels are described by transition diagrams, which indicate the output alphabet symbols
that result for each possible transmitted symbol and the probabilities of the various reception possibilities.
The probabilities on transitions coming from the same symbol must sum to one. For the matched-ﬁlter
receiver and the signal sets we have seen, the depicted transition diagram, known as a binary symmetric
channel, captures how transmitted bits are received. The probability of error pe is the sole parameter of
the digital channel, and it encapsulates signal set choice, channel properties, and the matched-ﬁlter receiver.
With this simple but entirely accurate model, we can concentrate on how bits are received.
