The series-diode detector is normally used where large input signals are supplied and a linear output
is required. The shunt-diode detector is used where the voltage variations are too small to produce a full
output from audio amplifier stages. Additional current amplifiers are required to bring the output to a
usable level. Other methods of detection and amplification have been developed which will detect low-
