Radar transmits microwave energy that reflects off an object and returns to the radar. The returned 
portion of the energy is called an ECHO, as it is in sound terminology. It is used to determine the 
direction and distance of the object causing the reflection. Determination of direction and distance to an 
object is the primary function of most radar systems.
