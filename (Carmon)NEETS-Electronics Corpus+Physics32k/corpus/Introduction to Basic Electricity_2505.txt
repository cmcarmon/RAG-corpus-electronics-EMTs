An oscilloscope is the most versatile piece of test 
equipment available for working on electronic equip-
ment and circuits. It provides a visual display of what 
is occurring in the circuit. Figure 22-6A shows an 
analog oscilloscope, and Figure 22-6B shows a digital 
oscilloscope. Both the analog and the digital oscillo-
scopes perform the same functions.
