FIGURE  71.5 Resonance  distortion  for  directly  modulated  laser
with resonance frequency of 7 GHz. Both the second-harmonic 2fi
and two-tone third-order 2fi â€“ fj distortion peak near half the res-
onance frequency and are small at low frequency. Also shown is the
same third-order distortion for an external modulator biased at the
point of zero second-order distortion.
