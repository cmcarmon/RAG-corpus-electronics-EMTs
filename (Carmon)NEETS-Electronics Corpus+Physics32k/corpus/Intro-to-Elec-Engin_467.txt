(a) Consider the input-offset voltage-nulling cir-
cuit for an inverting ampliﬁer shown in Figure
P5.3.4 (a). Let R1 = 1.5 k, R2 = 22 k,
R6 = 100 k, R5 = 500 k, R4 = 200 ,
and V = 12 V. Find the range of input offset
voltages that can be generated at terminal 2 of
the op amp. Also ﬁnd R3 such that the input
terminals see the same external resistance to
ground.
