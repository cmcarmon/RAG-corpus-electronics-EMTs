The ECG consists of two parts: the electrical activity of the atria and that of the ventricles. Both components
have an excitation wave and a recovery wave. Within the right atrium is a specialized node of modiﬁed cardiac
muscle, the sinoatrial (SA) node, that has a spontaneously decreasing transmembrane potential which reaches
the threshold potential (TP), resulting in self-excitation (Fig. 113.12, upper left). Therefore the SA node is the
cardiac  pacemaker,  establishing  the  heart  rate.  The  SA  node  action  potential  stimulates  the  adjacent  atrial
muscle, completely exciting it and giving rise to the ﬁrst event in the cardiac cycle, the P wave, the trigger for
atrial  contraction.  Atrial  excitation  is  propagated  to  another  specialized  node  of  tissue  in  the  base  of  the
ventricles, the atrioventricular (AV) node, the bundle of His and the Purkinje ﬁbers. Propagation of excitation
over the ventricles gives rise to the QRS, or simply the R wave, which triggers ventricular contraction. Meanwhile
during the QRS wave, the atria recover, giving rise to the Tp wave, following which the atria relax. The Tp wave
