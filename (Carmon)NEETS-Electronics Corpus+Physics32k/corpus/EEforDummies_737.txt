Most op amps come in 8‐pin DIPs (as shown in Figure 11-12), and include two 
input pins (pin 2, known as the inverting input, and pin 3, known as the non‐
inverting input) and one output pin (pin 6). An op amp is one type of differen-
tial amplifier: The circuitry inside the op amp produces an output signal that 
is a multiple of the difference between the signals applied to the two inputs.
