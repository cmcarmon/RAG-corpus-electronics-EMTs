The doping material in the semiconductor determines the acceptor energy level, and so both the host material
and the dopant are named. Since the energy level is quite small it can be populated by a considerable amount
by thermal excitation. Thus, for useful detection sensitivity the devices are normally operated at liquid nitrogen
and sometimes liquid helium temperatures. The current response, i, of a photoconductor can be written as
