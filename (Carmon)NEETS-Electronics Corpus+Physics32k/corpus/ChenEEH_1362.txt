High performance FORTRAN, or HPF, is an example of a
data parallel
language (Foster, 1995). Parallelism is mainly
expressed in terms of array operations: data elements of an
array are operated on simultaneously. There are data distribu-
tion directives to allow programmer control over data parti-
tioning, agglomeration, and mapping. Communication is
inferred by the compiler rather than by the programmer.
Although HPF offers a high level of abstraction, not all algo-
rithms can be expressed in the form of a data parallel program.
Hence, HPF is especially applicable to those programs easily
speciÔ¨Åed using array operations, such as numerical algorithms
based on regular domain decomposition.
