In Ô¨Ågure 5.7a the only path for DC bias current into the base is through RB. VCC is a
power supply voltage which is generally greater than 10 V such that VP N can be ignored. The
DC voltage at the collector should be large enough to provide at least a 2 V drop between
collector and emitter and clearly must be less than VCC.
In the absence of other circuit
requirements, a convenient algebraic choice for VC is VCC/2. DC circuit analysis results in
the following relative sizes of the two resistors:
