A less common but still important gate is called an 
 exclusive oR gate, abbreviated as XoR. An XOR 
gate has only two inputs, unlike the OR gate, which 
may have several inputs. However, the XOR is similar 
to the OR gate in that it generates a 1 output if either 
input is a 1. The exclusive OR is different when both 
inputs are 1s or 0s. In that case, the output is a 0.
