ROM cells can be formed as diodes or transistors at every
intersection of the word and bit lines of a ROM array (see
Fig. 80.7). One of the masks in the chip fabrication process
programs  which  of  these  devices  will  be  active.  Clever  layout  and  circuit  techniques  may  be  used  to  obtain
further density. Two such techniques are illustrated in Figs. 80.8 and 80.9. The X array shares bit and virtual
ground lines. The AND array places many ROM cells in series. Each of these series AND ROM cells is either
