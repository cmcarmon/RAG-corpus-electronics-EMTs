Thyristors
Thyristor valves were ﬁrst used for HVDC transmis-
sion  in  the  early  1970s,  and  since  then  have  com-
pletely  replaced  mercury  arc  valves.  The  term
thyristor valve, carried over from mercury arc valve,
is used to refer to an assembly of series and parallel
connection  of  several  thyristors  to  make  up  the
required  voltage  and  current  ratings  of  one  arm  of
the converter. The ﬁrst test thyristor valve in a HVDC
converter  station  was  installed  in  1967,  replacing  a
mercury arc valve in the Ygne converter station on
the island of Gotland (see Gotland I in Table 61.4).
The  Eel  River  back-to-back  station  in  New  Brun-
swick, Canada, commissioned in 1972, was the ﬁrst
all-thyristor  HVDC  converter  station.  The  voltage
and  current  ratings  of  thyristors  have  increased
steadily over the last two decades. Figure 61.18 shows
the maximum blocking voltage of thyristors from the
late  1960s  to  date.  The  current  ratings  have  also
increased in this period from 1 to 4 kA. Some of the increased current ratings were achieved with large-diameter
silicon wafers (presently 100-mm diameter) and with improved cooling systems. Earlier projects used air-cooled
thyristors. Water-cooled thyristors are used for all the recent projects.
