The picture elements on flat panel displays are not lighted continually. This would require a large 
amount of power and generate excessive heat. A sequential scan similar to a crt raster is used. Once again 
a page memory is required. The picture element electrodes are on and off as the scan sequentially 
addresses page memory.
