Magnetic tapes are wound onto tape reels with tension applied. This tension causes great layer-to-
layer pressure within the reel pack. Changes in temperature and humidity can cause the backing material
to expand or contract, creating even more pressure. All of this pressure causes the tape to become
deformed or warped.
