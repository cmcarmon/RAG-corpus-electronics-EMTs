The transient limitation of today’s VRM topologies comes
from their large output ﬁlter inductance. During the transient,
this large inductor limits the energy transfer speed so that the
capacitors have to store or discharge all the energy from the
load. For future microprocessors, because of heavier load cur-
rents, higher load transient slew rates, and tighter voltage
tolerance requirements, more decoupling capacitors will be
required to reduce the second spike, and more VRM output
bulk capacitors will be required to reduce the third spike. As a
result, to meet future speciﬁcations, 23 times the decoupling
capacitors will be needed, and 3 times VRM bulk capacitors
will be needed (Wong, 1997). The VRM will be very large and
expensive. The space of the VRM, however, is limited and the
real estate of the motherboard is expensive. The need for a
large quantity of capacitors makes VRMs, which use these
topologies, impractical for future microprocessors.
