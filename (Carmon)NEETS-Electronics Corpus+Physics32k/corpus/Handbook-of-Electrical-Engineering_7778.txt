The PE technique allows both the 0 and 1 states to be displayed by changes of magnetization. A 1 bit is given
by a north-to-north pole on the tape, and a 0 bit is given by a south-to-south pole on the tape. PE provides
approximately double the recording density and processor speed of NRZ. PE tapes carry an identiﬁcation mark
called a burst, which consists of successive magnetization changes at the beginning of track 4. This allows the
tape drive to recognize the tape mode and conﬁgure itself accordingly.
