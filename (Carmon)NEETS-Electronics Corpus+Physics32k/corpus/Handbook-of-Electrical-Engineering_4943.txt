In 1991, the IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity began publication. This quarterly journal focuses
on both the science and the technology of superconductors and their applications, including materials issues,
analog and digital circuits, and power systems. The proceedings of the Applied Superconductivity Conference
now appear in this journal.
