Using trafﬁc speciﬁcation (Tspec), the network can compute
various parameters describing how it will handle the ﬂow. By
combining the parameters, it is possible to compute the max-
imum queuing and routing delay that a packet can experience.
Using the ﬂuid ﬂow model, the queuing delay is approximately a
function of two parameters: the token bucket size b and the data
rate R that the application requests and gets when admitted.
