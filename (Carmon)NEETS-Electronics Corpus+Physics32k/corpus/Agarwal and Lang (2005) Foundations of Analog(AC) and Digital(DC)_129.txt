When a battery is connected across a resistor, as illustrated in Figure 1.4,
we saw that the battery delivers energy at some rate. The power was the rate
of delivery of energy. Where does this energy go? Energy is dissipated by
the resistor, through heat, and sometimes even light and sound if the resistor
overheats and explodes! We will discuss resistors and power dissipation in
Section 1.5.2.
