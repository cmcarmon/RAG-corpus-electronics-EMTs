However, the idea of adding the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) portion conditionally and selecting the results
once the carry-in signal is computed in the LSB portion is attractive. Such a scheme (which is a subset of CSA)
is known as “carry-select adder”. A 26-b carry-select adder consisting of two 13-bit portions is shown in Fig. 86.3.
Multiplication Algorithm
The multiplication operation is performed in a variety of forms in hardware and software. In the beginning of
computer development any complex operation was usually programmed in software or coded in the microcode
of the machine. Some limited hardware assistance was provided. Today it is more likely to ﬁnd full hardware
implementation of the multiplication for reasons of speed and reduced cost of hardware. However, in all of
them,  multiplication  shares  the  basic  algorithm  with  some  adaptations  and  modiﬁcations  to  the  particular
implementation and number system used. For simplicity we will describe a basic multiplication algorithm that
operates on positive n-bit-long integers X and Y resulting in the product P, which is 2n bits long:
