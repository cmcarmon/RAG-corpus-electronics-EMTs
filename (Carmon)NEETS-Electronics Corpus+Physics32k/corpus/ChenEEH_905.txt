represented as the simple undirected graph g C ¼ {V (C), E(C),
d }, where VC ¼ {v1, . . ., vr } is the set of
A(C), h(C)
vertices of the graph, EC ¼ {e1, . . ., ep} is the set of edges of the
graph, and the symmetric r  r matrix AC—called the adja-
cency matrix—contains the graph connectivity (West, 1996).
Vertices from g C correspond to the registers of the circuit C,
and the edges reﬂect the fact that pairs of registers are sequen-
tially adjacent. Note the cardinalities jVCj ¼ r and jECj ¼ p—
the circuit C has r registers and p local data paths. The adja-
cency matrix AC ¼ [aij]rr is a square matrix of order r  r
where both the rows and columns of A correspond to the
vertices of g C . As previously mentioned, for notational con-
venience sj denotes the clock skew corresponding to the edge
ej 2 EC . Speciﬁcally, if the vertices vi1 and vi2 correspond to the
?Ri2 connected by the
sequentially adjacent pair of registers Ri1
j-th edge ej, then:
