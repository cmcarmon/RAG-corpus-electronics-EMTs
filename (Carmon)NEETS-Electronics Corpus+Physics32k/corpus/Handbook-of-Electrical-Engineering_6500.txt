The  laser  (optical  carrier)  is  modulated  by  the  sum  of  the  video  channels  that  are  combined  to  form  the
total  RF  signal  spectrum.  The  resultant  optical  spectrum  contains  sidebands  from  the  IM  superimposed  on
, that generally accompanies IM. This complex optical spectrum
unintentional frequency modulation, or 
must by understood if certain subtle impairments are to be avoided.
