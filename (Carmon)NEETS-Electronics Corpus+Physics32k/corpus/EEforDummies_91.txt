Technically speaking, an individual battery isn’t really a battery (that is, a 
group of units working together); it’s a cell (one of those units). If you con-
nect several cells together, as you often do in many types of flashlights and 
children’s toys, then you’ve created a battery. The battery in your car is 
made up of six cells, each generating 2 to 2.1 volts, connected together to 
produce 12 to 12.6 volts total.
