properly, a strict temporal ordering of the many thousands of
switching events in the circuit is required. This strict ordering
is enforced by a global synchronizing clock signal delivered to
every register in a circuit by a clock distribution network.
Algorithms for determining a nonzero clock skew schedule
that satisfy the tighter timing constraints of high-speed VLSI
complexity systems can be found in (Friedman, 1995; Neves
and Friedman 1996a, 1996b; Afghani and Svensson, 1990;
Kourtev, 1999; Fishburn, 1990).
