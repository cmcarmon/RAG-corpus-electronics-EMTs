energy bands are either completely ﬁlled or totally empty. Obviously, the empty energy bands do not contribute
to the charge transfer. It is a fundamental result of solid-state physics that energy bands that are completely
ﬁlled also do not contribute. What happens is that in the ﬁlled bands the average velocity of electrons is equal

In metals, the number of free carriers is large and is not sensitive to doping.
