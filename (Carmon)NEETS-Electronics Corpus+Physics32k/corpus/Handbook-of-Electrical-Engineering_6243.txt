Reproduction of the camera image on a cathode ray tube (CRT) or solid-state display is accomplished by
an identical operation, with the scanning beam modulated in density by the video signal applied to an element
of the electron gun or control element, in the case of a solid-state display device. This control voltage to the
display varies the brightness of each picture element on the screen.
