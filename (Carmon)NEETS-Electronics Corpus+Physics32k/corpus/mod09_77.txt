These are reactive voltages that you have studied previously. The voltage across each reactance will 
be comparatively high. A comparatively high current times 2580 ohms yields a high voltage. At any given 
instant, this voltage will be of opposite polarity because the reactances are opposite in effect. EL + EC = 
zero volts
