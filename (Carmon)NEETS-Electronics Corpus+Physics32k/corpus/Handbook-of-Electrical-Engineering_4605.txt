Most people know that if a sample of certain types of material (e.g., iron) is subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld,
it will exhibit a retained magnetic behavior. Few, however, realize that some materials exhibit a similar retention
  is  the  phenomenon  in  which  certain  crystalline  or
effect  when  an  electric  ﬁeld  is  applied. 
polycrystalline materials retain electric polarization after an external electric ﬁeld has been applied and removed.
Since the direction of the polarization depends upon the direction of the applied ﬁeld and since the polarization
is quite persistent, memory devices can be based on this effect. Other applications have also been suggested.
