The output of the envelope detector is also applied to circuits that separate the sync signals
needed to lock in the horizontal and vertical sweep circuits of the receiver. The bursts of color
carriers are isolated such that a PLL can lock to the phase of the color carrier, and thereby provide
the reference signals for the chrominance synchronous detectors.
