Continuous-wave transmission has the disadvantage of being a relatively slow transmission method. 
Still, it has several advantages. Some of the advantages of cw transmission are a high degree of clarity 
under severe noise conditions, long-range operation, and narrow bandwidth. A highly skilled operator can 
pick out and read a cw signal even though it has a high degree of background noise or interference. Since 
only a single-carrier frequency is being transmitted, all of the transmitter power can be concentrated in the 
intelligence. This concentration of power gives the transmission a greater range. The use of spectrum
