In three dimensions, angular velocity can be represented by a pseudovector because second rank tensors are dual to pseudovectors in three dimensions. Notice that the tensor is a matrix with this structure:

{\displaystyle W(t)={\begin{pmatrix}0&-\omega _{z}(t)&\omega _{y}(t)\\\omega _{z}(t)&0&-\omega _{x}(t)\\-\omega _{y}(t)&\omega _{x}(t)&0\\\end{pmatrix}}}

As it is a skew symmetric matrix, it has a Hodge dual that is a vector, which is precisely the previous angular velocity vector
