If the transmitter were traveling away from the observer, as shown in view B of figure 1-20, the first
cycle would leave the transmitter at point P and the sixtieth at point P2. The first cycle would reach the
observer when the transmitter reached P2. You would then have 60 cycles stretched out over 1,080 plus
360 feet, a total of 1,440 feet. The wavelength of these 60 hertz is 1,440/60, or 24 feet. The apparent
frequency is 1,080 divided by 24, or 45 hertz.
