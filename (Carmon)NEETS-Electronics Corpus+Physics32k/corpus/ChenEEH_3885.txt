MPEG-21 accommodates digital item adaptation in a number of
ways, such as through digital item conﬁguration or media re-
source adaptation or transcoding as shown in Figure 5.3. Digital
item conﬁguration is the mechanism by which selections are
made among the elements of the digital items. The digital item
declaration includes a choice element that describes a set of
related selections that conﬁgure an item. A selection describes
a speciﬁc decision affecting the inclusion of conditional elem-
ents from the item. The result is the digital item declaration can
specify that items with the package that are optional or subject to
conditions. For example, the declaration can describe two video
ﬁles and indicate that one is conditionally included subject to
display on a high-resolution terminal, whereas the other is
included subject to display on a low-resolution terminal.
