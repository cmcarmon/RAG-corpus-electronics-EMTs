Procedure 
 
Connect the resistor network and power supply (or 
battery) as shown in Fig. 2.46. Select the 20 V d.c. 
voltage range on the multimeter then measure and 
record 
(this  should  be 
approximately  9  V).  Now  break  the  positive 
connection  to  the  circuit,  change  the  range  on  the 
multimeter  to  the  20  mA  d.c.  current  range  and 
measure the current supplied to the circuit.  
  Next  measure  and  record  the  voltage  dropped 
across each resistor (donâ€™t forget to change ranges 
on 
each 
measurement).  
  Finally,  break  the  circuit  at  one  end  of  each  of 
resistor in turn, then measure and record the current 
flowing.  Repeat  the  procedure  for  the  other  two 
resistor  networks  circuits  shown  in  Figs.  2.47  and 
2.48. 
 
Measurements and calculations 
 
Record  your  results  in  a  table  for  each  network. 
Use the recorded values of current and voltage for 
each resistor to calculate the value of resistance and 
compare this with the marked value. Check that the 
measured  value  lies  within  the  tolerance  band  for  
each resistor.  
  Calculate the resistance of each network (looking 
in  at  the  supply  terminals)  and  compare  this  with 
the  resistance  calculated  by  dividing  the  supply 
voltage by the supply current. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Comment on the results. Did your measured values 
agree  with  the  marked  values?  Were  these  within
