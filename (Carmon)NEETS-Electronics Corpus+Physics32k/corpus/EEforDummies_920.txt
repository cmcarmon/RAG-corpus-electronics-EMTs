You probably know that Benjamin Franklin “discovered” electricity in 1752 by 
flying a kite during a lightning storm. Actually, Franklin already knew about 
electricity and was well aware of its potential power — and potential danger. 
As Franklin carried out his experiment, he was careful to insulate himself 
from the conductive materials attached to the kite (the key and a metal wire) 
and to stay dry by taking cover in a barn. Had he not, we might be looking at 
someone else’s face on the $100 bill!
