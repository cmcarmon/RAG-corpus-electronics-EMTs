Transformers are rated in volt-amperes	(Va) 
rather than in power (watts). This is because of the 
loads that can be placed on the secondary winding. If 
the load is a pure capacitive load, the reactance could 
cause the current to be excessive. The power rating has 
little meaning where a volt-ampere  rating can identify 
the maximum current the transformer can handle.
