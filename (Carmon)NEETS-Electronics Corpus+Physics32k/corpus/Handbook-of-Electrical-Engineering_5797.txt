The terms primary and secondary refer to source and load sides, respectively (i.e., energy ﬂows from primary
to  secondary).  However,  in  many  applications  energy  can  ﬂow  either  way,  in  which  case  the  distinction  is
meaningless.  Also,  the  presence  of  a  third  winding  (tertiary)  confuses  the  issue.  The  terms  step  up  and  step
down refer to what the transformer does to the voltage from source to load. ANSI standards require that for a
two-winding transformer the high-voltage and low-voltage terminals be marked as H1-H2 and X1-X2, respec-
tively, with H1 and X1 markings having the same signiﬁcance as dots for polarity markings. [Refer to ANSI
C57 for comprehensive information.] Additive and subtractive transformer polarity refer to the physical posi-
tioning of high-voltage, low-voltage dotted terminals as shown in Fig. 64.4. If the dotted terminals are adjacent,
then the transformer is said to be subtractive, because if these adjacent terminals (H1-X1) are connected together,
the voltage between H2 and X2 is the difference between primary and secondary. Similarly, if adjacent terminals
X1 and H2 are connected, the voltage (H1-X2) is the sum of primary and secondary values.
