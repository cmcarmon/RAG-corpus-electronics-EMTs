Well-known examples of extended Petri nets include timed
Petri nets (Wang, 1998) and stochastic Petri nets (Marsan et
al., 1994; Haas, 2002). In this article, we present several exten-
sions to Petri nets based on our own research work and pro-
vide analysis techniques for these extended Petri net models.
We also discuss the intended applications of these extended
Petri nets and their potential beneÔ¨Åts.
