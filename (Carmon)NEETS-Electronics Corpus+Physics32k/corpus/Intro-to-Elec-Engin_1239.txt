*13.2.12 A squirrel-cage induction motor operates at a slip
of 0.05 at full load. The rotor current at starting is
Ô¨Åve times the rotor current at full load. Neglecting
stator resistance and rotational and stray-load
losses, and assuming constant rotor resistance,
calculate the starting torque and the maximum
torque in per-unit of full-load torque, as well as
the slip at which the maximum torque occurs.
