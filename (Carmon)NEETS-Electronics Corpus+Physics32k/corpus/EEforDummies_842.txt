frequencies, depending on the size and design of the speakers, within 
the audible frequency range (about 20 Hz [hertz] to 20 kHz [kilohertz]). 
For example, one speaker in a stereo system may generate sound in the 
bass range (low audible frequency) while another generates sound in 
a higher range. You need to pay close attention to speaker frequency 
range only when you’re building a high‐end audio system.
