Ppm can be generated in several ways, but we will discuss one of the simplest. Figure 2-46 shows
three waveforms associated with developing ppm from pdm. The pdm pulse train is applied to a
differentiating circuit. (Differentiation was presented in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to
Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) This provides positive- and negative-polarity pulses that
correspond to the leading and trailing edges of the pdm pulses. Considering pdm and its generation, you
can see that each pulse has a leading and trailing edge. In this case the position of the leading edge is
fixed, whereas the trailing edge is not, as shown in view (A) of figure 2-46. The resultant pulses after the
differentiation are shown in view (B). The negative pulses are position-modulated in accordance with the
modulating waveform. Both the negative and positive pulse are then applied to a rectification circuit. This
application eliminates the positive, non-modulated pulses and develops a ppm pulse train, as shown in
view (C).
