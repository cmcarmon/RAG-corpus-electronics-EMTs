Basically, the torque differential receiver operates like the electromagnets we discussed earlier in this 
chapter. In view B, the rotor and stator of the torque differential receiver receive energizing currents from 
two torque transmitters. These currents produce two resultant magnetic fields, one in the rotor and the 
other in the stator. Each magnetic field assumes an angle corresponding to that of the magnetic field in the 
transmitter supplying the signal. It is the interaction of these two resultant magnetic fields that causes the 
rotor in the TDR to turn.
