Noise reduction techniques can be categorized into four main
categories: signal-encoding schemes, which have been pro-
posed to minimize transition activities on buses; circuit tech-
niques to make circuits more immune to noise; interconnect
structures techniques, which are changing the interconnect
topology, wire sizing and spacing, and buffer locations; and
