 
Therefore,  an  inductor  is  a  frequency-dependent  resistance  that  is  directly 
proportional to frequency; ZL is small at low frequency and large at high frequency. At 
DC, the impedance of an inductor is zero. Just as for a capacitor, this expression shows 
that the voltage across an inductor lags the current by a phase of 90o.
