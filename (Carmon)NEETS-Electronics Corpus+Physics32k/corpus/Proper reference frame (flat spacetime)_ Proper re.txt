In case all three Frenet-Serret curvatures are constant, the corresponding worldlines are identical to those that follow from the Killing motions in flat spacetime. They are of particular interest since the corresponding proper frames and congruences satisfy the condition of Born rigidity, that is, the spacetime distance of two neighbouring worldlines is constant. These motions correspond to "timelike helices" or "stationary worldlines", and can be classified into six principal types: two with zero torsions (uniform translation, hyperbolic motion) and four with non-zero torsions (uniform rotation, catenary, semicubical parabola, general case):

produces uniform translation without acceleration. The corresponding proper reference frame is therefore given by ordinary Lorentz transformations. The other five types are:
