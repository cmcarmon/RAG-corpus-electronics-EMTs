The Disrete Fourier Transform
One of the methods, and one that is used extensively, calls for replacing continuous Fourier transforms by an
equivalent  discrete  Fourier  transform  (DFT)  and  then  evaluating  the  DFT  using  the  discrete  data.  However,
evaluating a DFT with 512 samples (a small number in most cases) requires more than 1.5 Â· 106 mathematical
operations. It was the development of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), a computational technique that reduces
