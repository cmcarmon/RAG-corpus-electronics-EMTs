Assuming the forward voltage drop across the LED is about 2.0 V (a typical 
value), you know that when the pulse is on, the voltage drop across resistor 
R3 is about 7 V. You get this result by taking the 9 V at pin 3 and subtract-
ing the 2 V dropped across the LED. From that, you can use Ohm’s Law (see 
Chapter 6) to calculate the current through R3, which is the same as the cur-
rent through the LED, as follows:
