A number of mathematical techniques can and have been used to recover the two-dimensional distribution
of the linear attenuation coefÔ¨Åcient from this array of measurements. These include iterative solution of a set
of  simultaneous  linear  equations,  Fourier  transform  approaches,  and  techniques  utilizing  back-projection
followed by deconvolution [Macovski, 1983]. Conceptually, the Fourier transform approach is perhaps the most
straightforward, so we will describe it in some detail.
