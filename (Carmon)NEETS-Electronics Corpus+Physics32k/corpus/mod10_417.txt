The chief advantage of the rigid line is its ability to minimize radiation losses. The electric and
magnetic fields in a two-wire parallel line extend into space for relatively great distances and radiation
losses occur. However, in a coaxial line no electric or magnetic fields extend outside of the outer
conductor. The fields are confined to the space between the two conductors, resulting in a perfectly
shielded coaxial line. Another advantage is that interference from other lines is reduced.
