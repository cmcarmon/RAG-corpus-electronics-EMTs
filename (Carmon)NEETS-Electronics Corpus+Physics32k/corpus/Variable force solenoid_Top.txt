A variable force solenoid (VFS) is an electro-hydraulic device that controls pressure proportionally or inversely proportionally to a signal (voltage or current) obtained from the on-board controller of a powertrain. A low-flow VFS is used as a signal level devices for transmission line pressure control or application of clutches. A high-flow VFS controls line pressure directly or are used for direct shift clutch control. A VFS is a type of Transmission Solenoid. One or more VFS can be used in an automatic transmission or installed in an automatic transmission valve body.
