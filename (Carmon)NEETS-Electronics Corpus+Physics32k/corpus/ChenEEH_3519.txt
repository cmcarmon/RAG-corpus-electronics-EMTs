A system is an entity that transforms an input signal into an
output signal according to a speciﬁed rule. Systems can be
classiﬁed into discrete-time systems or continuous-time
systems if the pair of input and output signals is discrete-
time or continuous time, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.9.
Systems can be hybrid (e.g., analog-to-digital converters)
where the input is continuous-time and the output discrete-
time.
