Yâ€²UV is often used as a term for YCbCr. However, they are completely different formats with different scale factors.
Nevertheless, the relationship between them in the standard case is simple. In particular, the Y channel is the same in both, both Cb and U are proportional to (B-Y), and both Cr and V are proportional to (R-Y).
