The Reynolds number (Re) is a dimensionless group, having no distinct units, that is commonly used in fluid dynamics and engineering. Originally described by George Gabriel Stokes in 1850, it became popularized by Osborne Reynolds, who the concept was specifically named after in 1908 by Arnold Sommerfeld. The Reynolds number is calculated as:




R

l

c


v

{\displaystyle Re={l_{c}v\rho  \over \mu }}

Examining the dimensions of the individual parameters, it becomes apparent that the Reynolds number is unit-less. The value represents the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces in a fluid, and is useful in determining the relative importance of viscosity. In inviscid flow, since the viscous forces are zero, the Reynolds number approaches infinity. When viscous forces are negligible, the Reynolds number is much greater than one. In such cases (Re>>1), assuming inviscid flow can be useful in simplifying many fluid dynamics problems.
