Years later, when I became a teacher of electronics, the curriculum for the program I was
going to teach had already been established around the notation of electron ﬂow. Oddly enough,
this was due in part to the legacy of my ﬁrst electronics instructor (the 20-year Navy veteran),
but that’s another story entirely! Not wanting to confuse students by teaching ”differently”
from the other instructors, I had to overcome my habit and get used to visualizing electron ﬂow
instead of conventional. Because I wanted my book to be a useful resource for my students, I
begrudgingly changed plans and illustrated it with all the arrows pointing the ”correct” way.
Oh well, sometimes you just can’t win!
