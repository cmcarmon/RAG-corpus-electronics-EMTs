TACHOMETERÂ—(1) A small ac or dc generator, sometimes referred to as a rate generator, that converts 
its shaft speed into an electrical output. The tachometer is frequently used in servosystems to sense the 
velocity of a load [15]. (2) An instrument that measures the rate at which a shaft is turning [16].
