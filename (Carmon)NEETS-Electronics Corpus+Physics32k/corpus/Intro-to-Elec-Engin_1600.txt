Va and Ia in Figure 16.1.11 denote the average values of the converter output voltage
and current, respectively. Assuming continuous conduction when the armature currents ﬂow
continuously without becoming zero for a ﬁnite time interval, the variation of Va with the ﬁring
angle is shown in Figure 16.1.11(b). Providing operation in the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants of
the Va–Ia plane, as shown in Figure 16.1.11(c), the fully controlled rectiﬁers are two-quadrant
