A normal plane is normal to a tooth surface at a pitch point, and perpendicular to the pitch plane. In a helical rack, a normal plane is normal to all the teeth it intersects. In a helical gear, however, a plane can be normal to only one tooth at a point lying in the plane surface. At such a point, the normal plane contains the line normal to the tooth surface.
Important positions of a normal plane in tooth measurement and tool design of helical teeth and worm threads are:
the plane normal to the pitch helix at side of tooth;
the plane normal to the pitch helix at center of tooth;
the plane normal to the pitch helix at center of space between two teeth
In a spiral bevel gear, one of the positions of a normal plane is at a mean point and the plane is normal to the tooth trace.
