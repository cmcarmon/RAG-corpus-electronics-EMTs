OGLE-2014-BLG-0124Lb is known as an exoplanet. These planets are located outside of our solar system. The Kepler telescope has allowed astronomers to discover thousands of these types of planets. Exoplanets obviously range in size, types, and orbits, but using this technique will help us search for planets that are of similar size to Earth. Since microlensing can determine the distance from the planet to the star and astronomers can identify its size, it can help determine if a planet could be habitable.
