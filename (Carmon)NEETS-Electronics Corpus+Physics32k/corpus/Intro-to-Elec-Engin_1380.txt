Wire-line channels are used extensively by the telephone network for voice, data, and video
transmission. Twisted-pair wire lines (with a bandwidth of several hundred kHz) and coaxial
cable (with a usable bandwidth of several MHz) are basically guided electromagnetic channels.
Fiber-optic channels offer a channel bandwidth that is several orders of magnitude larger than
coaxial cable channels. The transmitter or modulator in a ﬁber-optic communication system is a
light source, such as a light-emitting diode (LED) or a laser, whose intensity is varied (modulated)
with the message signal. The light propagates through the ﬁber as a light wave and is ampliﬁed
periodically along the transmission path to compensate for signal attenuation. At the receiver
end, the light intensity is detected by a photodiode, whose output is an electric signal that varies
