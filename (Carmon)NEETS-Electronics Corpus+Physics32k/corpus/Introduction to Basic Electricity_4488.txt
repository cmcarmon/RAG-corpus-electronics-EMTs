A synchronous counter operates as follows. Initially 
the counter is reset with both flip-flops in the 0 state. 
When the first clock pulse is applied, the first flip-flop 
toggles and the output goes high. The second flip-flop 
does not toggle because of the delay from the input 
to the actual changing of the output state. Therefore, 
there is no change in the second flip-flop output state. 
When the second clock pulse is applied, the first flip-
flop toggles and the output goes low. Because there is 
a high from the output of the first stage, the second
