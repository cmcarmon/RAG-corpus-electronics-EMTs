Instrumentation is a ﬁeld of study and work centering on measurement and control of physical
processes. These physical processes include pressure, temperature, ﬂow rate, and chemical
consistency. An instrument is a device that measures and/or acts to control any kind of physical
process. Due to the fact that electrical quantities of voltage and current are easy to measure,
manipulate, and transmit over long distances, they are widely used to represent such physical
variables and transmit the information to remote locations.
