conjunction with a 16-bit counter. The latches store the data which is to be loaded into the counter and are
loaded sequentially, since 16 bits are required for the counter but the data bus is only 8 bits wide. When loading
the counter with a speciﬁc value, the low-order byte is actually routed to the low-order 8-bit latch. Then, when
the high-order byte is supplied, it is simultaneously written into both the high-order 8-bit latch and the high-
order counter byte, and the low-order byte is also transferred from the latch to the counter. Countdown then
begins on the next clock pulse. This method ensures that the correct 16-bit value is loaded, but it also means
that the current count value can be modiﬁed, during counting if required, by writing to the counter, or the
subsequent counts can be modiﬁed by writing to the latches.
