circuit and not emit light until the voltage across it exceeds a particular
level, say 70 V. When the voltage level is reached, the lamp ﬁres (goes
on),  and  the  capacitor  discharges  through  it.  Due  to  the  low  resistance
of the lamp when on, the capacitor voltage drops fast and the lamp turns
off. The lamp acts again as an open circuit and the capacitor recharges.
By adjusting 
we can introduce either short or long time delays into
the  circuit  and  make  the  lamp  ﬁre,  recharge,  and  ﬁre  repeatedly  every
time  constant 
to  get
the capacitor voltage high enough to ﬁre or low enough to turn off.
