Look closely at the numbers 01020304 and 0A0B0C0D in Fig. 87.4. Notice that for both conﬁgurations, the
numbers read from left to right and that (visually) they appear to be in the same place. Furthermore, as pointed
out in the discussion of Fig. 87.3, the “beginning” or address of each of the numbers is identical. However, the
byte that is pointed at by the address is not the same and the internal bytes do not have the same addresses.
Getting big-endian and little-endian machines in a conversation is not easy. It proves to be even more muddled
than these ﬁgures suggest. A delightful and cogent discussion of the whole issue is found in Cohen [1981].
