When a processor attempts to load the contents of a memory location, the request is very urgent. In virtually
) if the memory request does
all computers, the work soon comes to a halt (in other words, the processor 
not return quickly. Modern computers are generally able to continue brieï¬‚y by overlapping memory requests,
but  even  the  most  sophisticated  computers  will  frequently  exhaust  their  ability  to  process  data  and  stall
momentarily  in  the  face  of  long  memory  delays.  Thus,  a  key  performance  parameter  in  the  design  of  any
computer, fast or slow, is the effective speed of its memory.
