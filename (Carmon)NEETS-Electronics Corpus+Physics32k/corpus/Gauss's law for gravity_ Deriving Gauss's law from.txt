Gauss's law for gravity can be derived from Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that the gravitational field due to a point mass is:





g

(

r

)
=
âˆ’
G
M




e

r




r

2






{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-GM{\frac {\mathbf {e_{r}} }{r^{2}}}}

where
er is the radial unit vector,
r is the radius, |r|.
M is the mass of the particle, which is assumed to be a point mass located at the origin.
A proof using vector calculus is shown in the box below. It is mathematically identical to the proof of Gauss's law (in electrostatics) starting from Coulomb's law.
