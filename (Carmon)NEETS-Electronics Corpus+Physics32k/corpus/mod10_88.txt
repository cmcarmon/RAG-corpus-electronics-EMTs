For example, the frequency of the whistle on a fast-moving train sounds increasingly higher in pitch
as the train is approaching than when the train is departing. Although the whistle is generating sound
waves of a constant frequency, and though they travel through the air at the same velocity in all
directions, the distance between the approaching train and the listener is decreasing. As a result, each
wave has less distance to travel to reach the observer than the wave preceding it. Thus, the waves arrive
with decreasing intervals of time between them.
