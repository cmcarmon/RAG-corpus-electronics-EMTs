Electrical burning has an effect on most vital body functions and is accompanied by several other electrical related injuries:
Damage to the veins and arteries which can cause ischaemic necrosis.
Involuntary contraction of muscles due to electrical interference which can cause bone fractures and dislocations.
Interference with the electrical conductivity of organs such as the heart and nerves. This can lead to seizures, lung injury due to severe central nervous system damage, and cardiac arrest.
Forceful propulsion of the body, producing such injuries as spinal and limb fractures.
These injuries must be treated in addition to the burns themselves. In very rare instances, a high voltage electric shock can cause cataracts in the lens of the eyes, and detachment of the retina. This may be delayed for some days or weeks after the initial injury.
