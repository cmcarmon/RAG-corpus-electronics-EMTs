Here’s how the parallel circuit in Figure 4-3 works: Current flows from the 
positive battery terminal, and then splits at the junction that leads to the 
parallel branches of the circuit, so each LED gets a share of the supply cur-
rent. The current flowing through LED1 doesn’t flow through LED2. So if your 
restaurant sign has 200 LEDs wired in parallel and one burns out, light still 
shines from the other 199 LEDs.
