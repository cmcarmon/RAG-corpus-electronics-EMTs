For beam cross-sections that are symmetrical about a plane perpendicular to the neutral plane, it can be shown that the tensile stress experienced by the beam may be expressed as:

{\displaystyle \sigma ={\frac {Mz}{I}}=-zE~{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}w}{\mathrm {d} x^{2}}}.\,}

Here,



z


{\displaystyle z}
is the distance from the neutral axis to a point of interest; and



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the bending moment. Note that this equation implies that pure bending (of positive sign) will cause zero stress at the neutral axis, positive (tensile) stress at the "top" of the beam, and negative (compressive) stress at the bottom of the beam; and also implies that the maximum stress will be at the top surface and the minimum at the bottom. This bending stress may be superimposed with axially applied stresses, which will cause a shift in the neutral (zero stress) axis.
