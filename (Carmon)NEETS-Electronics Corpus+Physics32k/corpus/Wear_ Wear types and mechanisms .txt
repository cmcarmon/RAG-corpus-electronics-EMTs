Wear is commonly classified according to so-called wear types, which occur in isolation or complex interaction. Common types of wear include:
Adhesive wear
Abrasive wear
Surface fatigue
Fretting wear
Erosive wear
Corrosion and oxidation wear
Other, less common types of wear are impact-, cavitation- and diffusive wear.
Each wear type is caused by one or more wear mechanisms. For example, the primary wear mechanism of adhesive wear is adhesion. Wear mechanisms and/or sub-mechanisms frequently overlap and occur in a synergistic manner, producing a greater rate of wear than the sum of the individual wear mechanisms.
