When light waves, which travel in straight lines, encounter any substance, they are either
transmitted, refracted, reflected, or absorbed. This is illustrated in figure 1-19. When light strikes a
substance, some absorption and some reflection always take place. No substance completely transmits,
reflects, or absorbs all of the light rays that reach its surface. Substances that transmit almost all the light
waves that fall upon them are said to be TRANSPARENT. A transparent substance is one through which
you can see clearly. Clear glass is transparent because it transmits light rays without diffusing them (view
A of figure 1-20). There is no known perfectly transparent substance, but many substances are nearly so.
Substances through which some light rays can pass but through which objects cannot be seen clearly
because the rays are diffused are called TRANSLUCENT (view B of figure 1-20). The frosted glass of a
light bulb and a piece of oiled paper are examples of translucent materials. Substances that do not transmit
any light rays are called OPAQUE (view C of figure 1-20). Opaque substances can either reflect or absorb
all of the light rays that fall upon them.
