where ∆τ = T/25. The solid line shows the noise performance if multipath propagation is not present, while
the system performance for k = –1/2 is given by the dashed curve. Note that FM-DCSK performs extremely
well over a radio channel suffering from multipath effects; the performance degradation even in the worst case
is less than a few dB. Note that conventional narrow-band systems cannot operate over this channel.
