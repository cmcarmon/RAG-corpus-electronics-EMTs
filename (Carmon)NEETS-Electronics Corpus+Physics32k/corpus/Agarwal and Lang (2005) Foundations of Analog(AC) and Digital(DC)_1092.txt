p r o b l e m 7.7 Consider the difference amplifier circuit shown in Figure 7.78.
Notice that the difference amplifier is powered by +VS and âˆ’VS power supplies.
Assume that all MOSFETs operate under the saturation discipline, and, unless indicated
otherwise, are characterized by the parameters K and VT.
