To better illustrate the concept of layout design, the design of an inverter in the CMOS technology is shown
in Fig. 25.7. An inverter produces an output voltage that is the logical inverse of its input. Considering the circuit
diagram of Fig. 25.7(a), when the input is 1, the lower nMOS is on, but the upper pMOS is off. Thus, the output
becomes 0 by becoming connected to the ground through the nMOS. On the other hand, if the input is 0, the
pMOS is on and the nMOS is off, so the output must ﬁnd a charge-up path through the pMOS to the supply
and therefore becomes 1. Figure 25.7(b) represents a layout for such an inverter. As can be seen from this ﬁgure,
the problem of a layout design is essentially reduced to drawing and painting a set of polygons. Layout editors
provide commands for drawing such polygons. The commands are usually entered at the keyboard or with a
mouse and, in some menu-driven packages, can be selected as options from a pull-down menu.
