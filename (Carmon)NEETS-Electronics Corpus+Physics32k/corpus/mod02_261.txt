The four parts of figure 4-3 show the variation of the alternating voltage and current in a capacitive 
circuit, for each quarter of one cycle. The solid line represents the voltage across the capacitor, and the 
dotted line represents the current. The line running through the center is the zero, or reference point, for 
both the voltage and the current. The bottom line marks off the time of the cycle in terms of electrical 
degrees. Assume that the ac voltage has been acting on the capacitor for some time before the time 
represented by the starting point of the sine wave in the figure.
