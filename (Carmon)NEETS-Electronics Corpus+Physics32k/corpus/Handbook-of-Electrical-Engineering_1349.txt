Variable Rate Coding
Previous standardization efforts and discussion here have centered on ﬁxed-rate coding of speech where a ﬁxed
number of bits are used to represent speech in digital form per unit of time. However, with recent developments
in transmission architectures (such as CDMA), the implementation of variable-rate speech coding algorithms
has become feasible. In variable-rate coding, the average data rate for conversational speech can be reduced
by a factor of at least 2.
