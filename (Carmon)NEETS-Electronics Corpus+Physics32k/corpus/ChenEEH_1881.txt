The CN service uses a generic backbone network service.
The backbone network service covers the layer 1 and layer 2
functionality and is selected according to the operator’s choice
to fulﬁll the QoS requirements of the CN bearer service. The
backbone network service is not speciﬁc to UMTS but may
reuse an existing standard.
