In an 1847 lecture entitled On Matter, Living Force, and Heat, James Prescott Joule characterized the terms latent heat and sensible heat as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively. He described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. a form of potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles or what was known as a living force. At the time of Joule kinetic energy either held 'invisibly' internally or held 'visibly' externally was known as a living force.
Latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a chemical substance or a thermodynamic system during a change of state that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a phase transition, such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The term was introduced around 1750 by Joseph Black as derived from the Latin latere (to lie hidden), characterizing its effect as not being directly measurable with a thermometer.
Sensible heat, in contrast to latent heat, is heat transferred to a thermodynamic system that effects a change of temperature in the system, while some other specified state variable or variables are left unchanged.
Both latent heat and sensible heat transfers increase the internal energy of the system to which they are transferred.
Black's distinction, between sensible and latent heat, was a step in the generation of the analytic method of thermodynamics, such as the distinction and relation between heat and work. It is examined in the Wikipedia article on calorimetry.
