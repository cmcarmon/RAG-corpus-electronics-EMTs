The number of free electrons resulting from ionization is dependent upon the quantity of energy
applied to a material, as well as the atomic structure of the material. At room temperature some materials,
classified as conductors, have an abundance of free electrons. Under a similar condition, materials
classified as insulators have relatively few free electrons.
