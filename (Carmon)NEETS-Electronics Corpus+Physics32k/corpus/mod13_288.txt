LOGIC LEVELS High and LOW represent the voltage levels of the two logic states. Logic level
HIGH represents the more positive voltage while logic level LOW represents the less positive (more
negative) voltage. In positive logic, the HIGH level corresponds to the TRUE or 1 state and the LOW
level corresponds to the FALSE or 0 state. In negative logic, the HIGH level corresponds to the FALSE
or 0 state and the LOW level corresponds to the TRUE or 1 state.
