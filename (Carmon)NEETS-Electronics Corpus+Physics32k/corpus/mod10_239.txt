Any frequency that is a whole number multiple of a smaller basic frequency is known as a 
HARMONIC of that basic frequency. The basic frequency itself is called the first harmonic or, more 
commonly, the FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY. A frequency that is twice as great as the fundamental 
frequency is called the second harmonic; a frequency three times as great is the third harmonic; and so on. 
For example:
