The use of resistance by itself in filter circuits does not provide any filtering action, because it 
opposes the flow of any current regardless of its frequency. What it does, when connected in series or 
parallel with an inductor or capacitor, is to decrease the "sharpness," or selectivity, of the filter. Hence, in 
some particular application, resistance might be used in conjunction with inductance or capacitance to 
provide filtering action over a wider band of frequencies.
