The main interaction between spins of transition metal ions in solids is usually provided by superexchange. This interaction depends on details of the crystal structure such as the bond length between magnetic ions and the angle formed by the bonds between magnetic and ligand ions. Symmetric exchange can be both positive and negative and is the main responsible of magnetic ordering. As the strength of symmetric exchange depends on the relative position of the ions, it couples spins to collective lattice distortions, called phonons. Coupling of spins to collective distortion with a net electric dipole can happen if the magnetic order breaks inversion symmetry. Thus, symmetric exchange can provide a handle to control magnetic properties through an external electric field.
