Various factors in the antenna circuit affect the radiation of these waves. In figure 4-5, for example, 
if an alternating current is applied at the A end of the length of wire from A to B, the wave will travel 
along the wire until it reaches the B end. Since the B end is free, an open circuit exists and the wave 
cannot travel farther. This is a point of high impedance. The wave bounces back (reflects) from this point 
of high impedance and travels toward the starting point, where it is again reflected. The energy of the 
wave would be gradually dissipated by the resistance of the wire of this back-and-forth motion 
(oscillation); however, each time it reaches the starting point, the wave is reinforced by an amount 
sufficient to replace the energy lost. This results in continuous oscillations of energy along the wire and a 
high voltage at the A end of the wire. These oscillations are applied to the antenna at a rate equal to the 
frequency of the rf voltage.
