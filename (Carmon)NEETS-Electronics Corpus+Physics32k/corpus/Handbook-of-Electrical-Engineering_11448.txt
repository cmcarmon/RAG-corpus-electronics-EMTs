The  dependence  of  the  collection  efﬁciency  on  interaction  depth  reduces  energy  resolution  and  without
mitigation would limit high resolution to thin devices. Fortunately, methods have been developed that permit
high-energy resolution to be achieved in relatively thick samples. As with cooled semiconductor detectors, the
energy  resolution  of  the  combined  detector-electronics  system  is  normally  speciﬁed  by  the  full  width  of  a
monoenergetic spectral peak at its half amplitude points (∆E). The FWHM is, in turn, related to the variance
in the peak L2 (see Eq. 116.7). It is useful to note that the energy resolution is inversely related to the product µτ.
Operational Considerations
Important  physical  parameters  for  the  leading  room-temperature  detectors  are  summarized  in  Table 116.2.
Detectors are available with surface areas of a few square centimeters and thicknesses up to about 1 cm. The
performance  of  detectors  based  on  the  different  materials  varies  considerably,  as  can  the  performance  for
detectors of the same material. The choice of speciﬁc detector material is normally dictated by the application.
The exceptionally high resistivity and high photoelectric cross section in mercuric iodide permit good resolution
and high efﬁciency in the X-ray region, particularly below 10 KeV. For example, ∆E of 5% at 5.9 KeV has been
reported [21] with 1 cm2 devices, with typical values in the region of 10%. For mercuric iodide applications in
the region of 0.5 MeV, trade-offs between efﬁcient gamma absorption and resolution may be required.
