The average velocity is parallel to axis (



z


{\displaystyle z}
direction)of the ducts,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =v\mathbf {e} _{z}}

The mass flux in the axial direction is constant

Axial diffusion is negligible compared to the transverse/radial diffusion
The flame occurs infinitely fast, therefore flame appears as a reaction sheet across which properties of flow changes
Effects of gravity has been neglected
