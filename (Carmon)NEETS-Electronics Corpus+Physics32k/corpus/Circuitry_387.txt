Figure 7.49  An improved 3 W audio amplifier. This amplifier has a nominal input resistance of 50 kP and 
a frequency response extending from 30 Hz to 30 kHz at the I3dB power points. Capacitor C5 is added to 
‘roll-off’  the  high  frequency  response  (without  this  component  the  high-frequency  response  extends  to 
around 100 kHz). RV2 is adjusted for a quiescent (no-signal) collector current for TR3 (and TR4) of 25 mA. 
RV3 is adjusted for a d.c. voltage of exactly 9 V at the junction of the two low-value thermal compensating 
resistors, R11 and R12. C8 and R13 form a Zobel network to provide frequency compensation of the output 
load.
