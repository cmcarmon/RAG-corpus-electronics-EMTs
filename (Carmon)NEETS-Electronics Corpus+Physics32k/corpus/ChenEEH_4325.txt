By the time an engineer completes his or her undergraduate
studies, familiarity exists with matrices and matrix operations
through multivariable calculus or linear algebra. Moreover, a
graduate should have a ﬁrm understanding of the importance
in regarding matrices as representations of linear operators.
For a detailed discussion of linear operations and their related
matrix representations, see Schrader and Sain (2000). Of
course, standard matrix notions can be generalized and ex-
pressed using rings and ﬁelds, which is the approach used here.
