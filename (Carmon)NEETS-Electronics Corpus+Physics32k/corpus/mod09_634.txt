end of the fourth time constant, 2 volts. At the end of the fifth time constant, the voltage across the 
resistor will be very close to 0 volts. Since the time constant is equal to 10 microseconds, it will take a 
total of 50 microseconds to completely charge the capacitor and stop current flow in the circuit.
