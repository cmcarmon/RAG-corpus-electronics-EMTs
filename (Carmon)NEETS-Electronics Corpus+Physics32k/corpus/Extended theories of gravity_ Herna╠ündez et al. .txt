One such theory is also an extension to general relativity and Newton's Universal gravity law (

), first proposed in 2010 by the Mexican astronomers Xavier Hernández Doring, Sergio Mendoza Ramos et al., researchers at the Astronomy Institute, at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. This theory is in accordance with observations of kinematics of the solar system, extended binary stars, and all types of galaxies and galactic groups and clouds. It also reproduces the gravitational lensing effect with out the need of postulating dark matter.
There is some evidence that it could also explain the dark energy phenomena and give a nice solution to the initial conditions problem.
These results can be classified as a metric f(R) gravity theory, more properly an f(R,T) theory, derived from an action principle. This approach to solve the dark matter problem takes into account the Tully–Fisher relation as an empirical law that applies always at scales larger than the Milgrom radius.
