in which c is the speed of light. The mode subscript mnl refers
to the number of half-sinusoidal variations in the standing-
wave pattern (resonance) along the x, y, and z directions,
respectively. If b < a < d is valid, the cavity will support the
dominant mode TE101, which has the lowest resonant fre-
quency. The unloaded Q value of this mode can range from
5,000 to 15,000 depending on the cavity surface and the metal
conductivity. Obviously, the smoother the surface is, the lower
the losses. The dominant TM resonant mode is TM110.
