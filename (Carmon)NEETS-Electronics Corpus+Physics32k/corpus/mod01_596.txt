In the study of electricity, it is often necessary to reduce a complex circuit into a simpler form. Any
complex circuit consisting of resistances can be redrawn (reduced) to a basic equivalent circuit containing
the voltage source and a single resistor representing total resistance. This process is called reduction to an
EQUIVALENT CIRCUIT.
