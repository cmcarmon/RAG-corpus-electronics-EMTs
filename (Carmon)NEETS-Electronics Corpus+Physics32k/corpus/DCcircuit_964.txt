The ﬁrst step in the Mesh Current method is to identify “loops” within the circuit encom-
passing all components. In our example circuit, the loop formed by B1, R1, and R2 will be the
ﬁrst while the loop formed by B2, R2, and R3 will be the second. The strangest part of the
Mesh Current method is envisioning circulating currents in each of the loops. In fact, this
method gets its name from the idea of these currents meshing together between loops like sets
of spinning gears:
