The  distribution  system  load  varies  during  the  day.  The  maximum  load  occurs  in  the  early  evening  or  late
afternoon, and the minimum load occurs at night. The design of the distribution system requires both values,
because  the  voltage  drop  is  at  the  maximum  during  the  peak  load,  and  overvoltage  may  occur  during  the
minimum load. The power companies continuously study the statistical variation of the load and can predict
the expected loads on the primary feeders with high accuracy. The feeder design considers the expected peak
load or maximum demand and the future load growth.
