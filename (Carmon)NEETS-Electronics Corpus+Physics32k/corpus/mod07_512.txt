So far only voltage regulators that use variable resistors have been explained. However, this type of 
regulation has limitations. Obviously, the variable resistor cannot be adjusted rapidly enough to 
compensate for frequent fluctuations in voltages. Since input voltages fluctuate frequently and rapidly, the 
variable resistor is not a practical method for voltage regulation. A voltage regulator that operates 
continuously and automatically to regulate the output voltage without external manipulation is required 
for practical regulation.
