Delay, noise, slope limits, and gate oxide wear out were all
considered by Intel designers when drafting the guidelines for
the wire and repeater methodology. Notable features were an
increased emphasis on noise robustness and ‘‘pushed process’’
considerations for delay (repeater distance guidelines were
made shorter than optimal for delay with the existing process
in anticipation of end-of-life process trending when transistors
greatly speed up compared to wires). Repeater sizing, rather
than best delay optimization for noncoupled wires, was picked
to be optimal for noise rejection, for equal rise and fall delays,
and for better delay in the presence of coupling. Stringent
limitations were put on maximum sizing of repeaters, espe-
cially in busses, to reduce collapse of power supply caused by a
simultaneously switching bank of repeaters. The methodology
and tools allowed Intel developers to use both inverting and
noninverting repeaters. Simple length-based design rules were
provided for repeaters, and further optimization was possible
through internally developed proprietary tools: NoisePad,
ROSES, and Visualizer (net routing and timing) analysis. The
extensive use of dedicated repeater blocks is evident in the
Pentium 4 Processor ﬂoor plan. Further, the net length com-
parison in Figure 8.13 shows that although the Pentium 4
Processor is a much larger chip, it has very few long nets
compared to the previous generation of chips, such as the
Pentium III Processor. This is even more notable given that
the Pentium 4 Processor has more than twice as many full-chip
nets as the Pentium III Processor and has architecturally bigger
blocks. If we compare the M5 wire segments of the Pentium III
and Pentium 4 processors, we note that 90% of the M5 wire
segments of the Pentium 4 processor are shorter than 2000
microns, while the same percentage of Pentium III Processor
wires are 3500 microns long. These short wires are a key to
enabling high-frequency operation.
