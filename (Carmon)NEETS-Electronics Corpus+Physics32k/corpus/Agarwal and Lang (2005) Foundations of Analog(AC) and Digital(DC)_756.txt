We are often interested in simplifying logic expressions to minimize their
implementation cost. For example, although the expression A + BB + C
appears to require three gates,6 simplification of the logic expression will result
in a single gate. Notice that the expression BB always results in the answer 0
(a variable and its complement can never be TRUE at the same time). Further-
more, observe that A+ 0 is always A. From these observations, we can simplify
the expression as
