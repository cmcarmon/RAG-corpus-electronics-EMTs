In many cases, the matrix product L*L is invertible, thereby rendering a unique solution to these equations.
Whatever  the  case,  the  associated  vector  representation  for  the  optimum  matrix  contained  in  + is  given  by
a c(uo) =  Luo. Finally, the corresponding optimum approximating matrix A(uo) is simply obtained by reversing
the column vector concatenation mapping that generates ac(uo).
Example 5. To illustrate the above procedure, let us consider the speciﬁc case of the class of real 3 ·  2 Toeplitz
matrices. A general parametric representation for a matrix in this class and its associated concatenated vector
equivalent is given by
