Monolithic	integrated	circuits are constructed 
in the same manner as transistors but include a few 
additional steps. The integrated circuit begins with 
a circular silicon wafer 3 to 4 inches in diameter and 
about 0.010 inch thick. This serves as a substrate (base) 
on which the integrated circuits are formed. Many 
 integrated circuits are formed at the same time on this 
 waferâ€”up to several hundred, depending on the size 
of the wafer. The integrated circuits on the wafer are 
generally all the same size and type and contain the 
same number and type of components (Figure 34-1).
