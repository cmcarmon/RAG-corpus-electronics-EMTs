 
Therefore, a gain of 1 is equivalent to 0 dB, a gain of 10 is equivalent to 20 dB, a gain of 
100 is equivalent to 40 dB, and so on. Other commonly used dB values include -3 dB 
which is a gain of approximately 1/ 2 = 0.707 and -6 dB which is approximately 0.5. A 
list of commonly encountered dB values and their linear equivalents is shown in Table 9.1. 
It is important to remember that just as linear gain is a relative measurement of the input 
and output of a circuit, gain on the dB scale is also a relative measure and is not tied to a 
specific voltage.
