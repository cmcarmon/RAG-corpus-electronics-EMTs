Before describing how this circuit operates, the definition of the word "load" as it applies to power
supplies must be understood. Load is defined as any device that draws current. A device that draws little
current is considered a light load, whereas a device that draws a large amount of current is a heavy load.
Remember that when we speak of "load," we are speaking about the device that draws current from the
power source. This device may be a simple resistor, or one or more complicated electronic circuits.
