Interleaved memory systems found in high-end vector supercomputers are slight variants on the basic complex
interleaved  memory  system  of  Fig.  88.6.  Such  memory  systems  may  have  hundreds  of  banks,  with  multiple
memory  controllers  that  allow  multiple  independent  memory  requests  to  be  made  every  clock  cycle.  Two
examples of modern vector supercomputers are the Cray T-90 series and the NEC SX series. The Cray T-90
models  come  with  varying  numbers  of  processors—up  to  32  in  the  largest  conﬁguration.  Each  of  these
processors is coupled with 256 Mbyte of memory, split into 16 banks of 16 Mbyte each. The T-90 has complex
interleaving among banks. the largest conﬁguration (the T-932) has 32 processors, for a total of 512 banks and
8 Gbyte of main memory. The T-932 can provide a peak of 800 Gbyte/s bandwidth out of its memory system.
NEC’s SX-4 product line, their most recent vector supercomputer series, has numerous models. Their largest
single-node  model  (with  one  processor  per  node)  contains  32  processors,  with  a  maximum  of  8  Gbyte  of
memory, and a peak bandwidth of 512 Gbyte/s out of main memory. Although the sizes of the memory systems
are vastly different between workstations and vector machines, the techniques that both use to increase total
bandwidth and minimize bank conﬂicts are similar.
