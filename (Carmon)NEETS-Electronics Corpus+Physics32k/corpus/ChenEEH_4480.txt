The full-state feedback control problem is to choose the control
k as a function of the state x so that the cost criterion of equation
5.3 is minimized. The general partial observation or output
feedback control problem is to choose the control k as a function
of the observation y so that the cost of equation 5.3 is minimized.
Assume now that the problem has a solution of the qua-
