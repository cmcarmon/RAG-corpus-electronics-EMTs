Having  considered  the  general  case  of  wave  propagation  through  a  lossy  medium,  we  now  consider  wave
propagation in other types of media. A medium is said to be a good conductor if the loss tangent is large (s  >>
we) or a lossless or good dielectric if the loss tangent is very small (s  << we). Thus, the characteristics of wave
propagation  through  other  types  of  media  can  be  obtained  as  special  cases  of  wave  propagation  in  a  lossy
medium as follows:
