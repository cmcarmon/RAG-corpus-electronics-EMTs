An RC network can change the shape of complex 
waveforms so that the output barely resembles the 
 input. The amount of distortion is determined by the 
RC time constant. The type of distortion is determined 
by the component the output is taken across. If the 
output is taken across the resistor, the circuit is called 
a differentiator. A differentiator is used to produce 
a pip or peaked waveform from square or rectangular 
waveforms for timing or synchronizing circuits. It is 
also used to produce trigger or marker pulses. If the 
output is taken across the capacitor, the circuit is called 
an integrator. An integrator is used for waveshaping 
in radio, television, radar, and computers.
