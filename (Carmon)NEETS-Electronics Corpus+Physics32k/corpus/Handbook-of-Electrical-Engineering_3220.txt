Special Power Supplies
Using the inverters and cycloconverters, it is possible to realize bidirectional ac and dc power supplies. In these
power supplies [Rashid, 1988], power can ï¬‚ow in both directions, i.e., from input to output or from output
to input. It is also possible to control the ac-to-dc converters to obtain sinusoidal line current with unity PF
and low harmonic distortion at the ac source.
