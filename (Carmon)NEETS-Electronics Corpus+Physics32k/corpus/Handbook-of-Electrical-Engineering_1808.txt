Image Quality and Visual Perception
An  important  factor  in  designing  video  signal  processing  algorithms  is  that  the  ﬁnal  receiver  of  the  video
information is typically a human observer. This has an impact on how the quality of the ﬁnal signal is assessed
and how the processing should be performed. If our objective is video transmission over a limited bandwidth
channel, we do not want to waste unnecessary bits on information that cannot be seen by the human observer.
In addition, it is undesirable to introduce artifacts that are particularly annoying to the human viewer. Unfor-
tunately,  there  are  no  perfect  quantitative  measures  of  visual  perception.  The  human  visual  system  is  quite
complicated. In spite of the advances that have been made, no complete model of human perception exists.
Therefore, we often have to rely on subjective testing to evaluate picture quality. Although no comprehensive
model  of  human  vision  exists,  certain  functions  can  be  characterized  and  then  used  in  designing  improved
solutions. For more information, see Netravali and Haskell [1988].
