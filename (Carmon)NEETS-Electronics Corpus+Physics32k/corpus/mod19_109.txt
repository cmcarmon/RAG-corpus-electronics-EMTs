Heat is important in the treatment of shock to the extent that the injured person's body heat must be 
conserved. Exposure to cold, with resulting loss of body heat, can cause shock to develop or to become 
worse. You will have to judge the amount of covering to use by considering the weather and the general 
circumstances of the accident. Often a light covering will be enough to keep the casualty comfortable. 
Wet clothing should be removed and dry covering provided, even on a hot day. Use blankets or any dry 
material to conserve body heat. Artificial means of warming (hot water bottles, heated bricks, heated 
sand) should not ordinarily be used. Artificial heat may cause loss of body fluids (by sweating) and it 
brings the blood closer to the surface, thus defeating the body's own efforts to supply blood to the vital 
organs and to the brain. Also, the warming agent may burn the victim.
