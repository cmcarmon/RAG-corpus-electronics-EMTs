When it was discovered that magnetic nanos can be used as geocache containers, they were quickly mass-produced and sold for that purpose. They are widely known in the geocaching community as one of the smallest geocache containers.
Magnetic nano geocaches only contain a thin, rolled-up paper sheet for geocachers to sign their username initials on.
