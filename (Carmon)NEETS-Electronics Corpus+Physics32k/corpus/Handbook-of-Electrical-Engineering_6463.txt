one  or  two  options.  First,  the  multipath  can  be  treated  as  a  form  of  interference,  which  means  the  receiver
should attempt to attenuate it as much as possible. Indeed, under this condition, all of the multipath returns
that arrive at the receiver with a time delay greater than a chip duration from the multipath return to which
the receiver is synchronized (usually the Ô¨Årst return) will be attenuated because of the processing gain of the
system.
