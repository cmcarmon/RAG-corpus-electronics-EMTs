Exploiting the special structure of speech requires going beyond the capabilities of analog signal processing
systems. Many speech transmission systems work by ﬁnding the speaker’s pitch and the formant frequencies.
Fundamentally, we need to do more than ﬁltering to determine the speech signal’s structure; we need to
manipulate signals in more ways than are possible with analog systems. Such ﬂexibility is achievable (but
not without some loss) with programmable digital systems.
