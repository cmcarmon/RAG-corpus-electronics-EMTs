. The redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) was
introduced by David Patterson and other researchers at
the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1980s. It
is a method where two or more disks are used to store
data. Data can be read simultaneously from more than
one drive, which improves the performance. Data can
also be split among all drives in bits, bytes, or blocks.
Typically two or more disks are connected together. A
single controller can be used to connect the drives so that
they function together as one drive. For extra safety, a
second interface controller can be installed to duplex the
drives and increase read performance. The major advan-
tages of RAID are improvement in reliability and protec-
tion for data in mass storage systems.
