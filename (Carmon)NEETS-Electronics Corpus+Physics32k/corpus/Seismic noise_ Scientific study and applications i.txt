The recording of seismic noise directly from the ground started in the 1950s with the enhancement of seismometers to monitor nuclear tests and the development of seismic arrays. The main contributions at that time for the analysis of these recordings came from the Japanese seismologist K. Aki  in 1957. He proposed several methods used today for local seismic evaluation, such as Spatial Autocorrelation (SPAC), Frequency-wavenumber (FK), and correlation. However, the practical implementation of these methods was not possible at that time because of the low precision of clocks in seismic stations.
Again, improvements in instrumentation and algorithms led to renewed interest on those methods in the 1990s. Y.Nakamura rediscovered in 1989 the Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (H/V) method to derive the resonance frequency of sites. Assuming that shear waves dominate the microtremor, Nakamura observed that the H/V spectral ratio of ambient vibrations was roughly equal to the S-wave transfer function between the ground surface and the bedrock at a site. (However, this assumption has been questioned by the SESAME project.)
In the late 1990s, array methods applied to seismic noise data started to yield ground properties in terms of shear waves velocity profiles. The European Research project SESAME  (2004â€“2006) worked to standardize the use of seismic noise to estimate the amplification of earthquakes by local ground characteristics.
