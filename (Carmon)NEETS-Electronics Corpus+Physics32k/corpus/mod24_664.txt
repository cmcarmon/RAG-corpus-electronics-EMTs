At currents below the threshold current, LDs function as ELEDs. To optimize frequency response,
laser diodes are often biased above this laser threshold. As a result, in an LD fiber optic system, light is
modulated between a high power level and a lower power level, but never shut off. LDs typically can be
modulated at frequencies up to over 2 gigahertz (GHz). Some lasers are capable of being modulated at
frequencies over 20 GHz.
