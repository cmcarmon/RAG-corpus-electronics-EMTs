Here, the output signal y (n) is related to its past values y (n − l), l = {1, . . . , p}, and to the current and past
values of the input signal x (n). The system’s characteristics are determined by the choices for the number
of coeﬃcients p and q and the coeﬃcients’ values {a1, . . . , ap} and {b0, b1, . . . , bq}.
