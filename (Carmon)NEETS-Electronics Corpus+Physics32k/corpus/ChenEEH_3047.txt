For a synchronous machine driven by a turbine, the turbine
is controlled by a governor that regulates its speed to maintain
60 Hz while generating the power required. The electrical gen-
erator has a voltage regulator and exciter that control its out-
put voltage. The synchronous generator is covered in more
detail in Chapter 4, Electric Machines.
