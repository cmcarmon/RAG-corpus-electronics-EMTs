Level 2 assignments 
 
Assignment 1  Electronic circuit construction 
For  each  one  of  five  simple  electronic  circuits 
shown in Figs A1.1 to A1.5: 
(a)  Identify  and  select  the  components  required  to 
build the circuit. 
(b) Identify an appropriate method of construction 
selected from the following list: 
(cid:127) breadboard; 
(cid:127) tag board; 
(cid:127) stripboard; 
(cid:127) printed circuit board; 
(cid:127) wire wrapping. 
 
Assemble  and  test  each  circuit  according  to  its 
circuit  diagram.  Note  that  a  different  construction 
method must be selected for each circuit. 
 
Assignment 2  Electronic circuit testing 
For  each  of  the  circuits  in  Figs  Al.l  to  A1.5, 
describe the type and nature of the input and output 
signals (as appropriate). For each circuit select and 
use  appropriate  measuring 
(e.g. 
multimeter and oscilloscope) to test and check the 
operation  of  each  circuit.  Write  a  short  report  to 
summarize your findings.
