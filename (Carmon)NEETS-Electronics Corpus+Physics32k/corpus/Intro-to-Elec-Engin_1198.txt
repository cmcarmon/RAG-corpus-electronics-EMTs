The open-circuit and load characteristics of a separately excited dc generator, along with
its schematic diagram of connections, are shown in Figures 13.4.5(a) and (b). It can be seen
from the form of the external volt–ampere characteristic, shown in Figure 13.4.5(c), that the
terminal voltage falls slightly as the load current increases. Voltage regulation is deﬁned as the
percentage change in terminal voltage when full load is removed, so that, from Figure 13.4.5(c)
it follows that
