This level provides an easily readable microprogram and does much to help avoid syntax errors. In binary,
only  the  programmer  can  catch  a  faulty  1  or  0;  the  microassembler  can  catch  syntax  errors  or  some  faulty
register speciÔ¨Åcations. No microassembler exists that can catch all logic errors in the implementation of a given
instruction  algorithm.  It  is  still  very  easy  to  make  mistakes.  It  should  be  noted  that  this  level  is  a  good
compromise between convenience and cost.
