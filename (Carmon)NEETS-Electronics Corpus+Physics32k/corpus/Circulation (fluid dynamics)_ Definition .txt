If V is the fluid velocity on a small element of a defined curve, and dl is a vector representing the differential length of that small element, the contribution of that differential length to circulation is dΓ:

where θ is the angle between the vectors V and dl.

The dimensions of circulation are length squared, divided by time; L2⋅T−1, which is equivalent to velocity times length.
