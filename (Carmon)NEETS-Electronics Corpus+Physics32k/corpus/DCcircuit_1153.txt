These are fairly small numbers to work with, so wire sizes are often expressed in measures
of thousandths-of-an-inch, or mils. For the illustrated example, we would say that the diameter
of the wire was 101.9 mils (0.1019 inch times 1000). We could also, if we wanted, express the
area of the wire in the unit of square mils, calculating that value with the same circle-area
formula, Area = Ï€r2:
