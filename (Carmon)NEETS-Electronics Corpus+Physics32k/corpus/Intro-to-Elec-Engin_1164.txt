the armature winding, under balanced conditions of operation we will analyze it on a per-phase
basis. The armature winding obviously has a resistance Ra and a leakage reactance Xl of the
armature per phase.
The armature current ¯Ia produces the armature reaction ﬂux, the effect of which can be
represented by an inductive reactance Xφ, known as magnetizing reactance or armature reaction
reactance. Thus Figure 13.3.1 shows the equivalent circuits in phasor notation, with all per-phase
quantities, for a cylindrical-rotor synchronous machine working as either a generator or a motor.
The sum of the armature leakage reactance and the armature reaction reactance is known as the
synchronous reactance,
(13.3.1)
and Ra + j Xs is called the synchronous impedance Zs. Thus, the equivalent circuit for an
unsaturated cylindrical-rotor synchronous machine under balanced polyphase conditions reduces
to that shown in Figure 13.3.1(b), in which the machine is represented on a per-phase basis by
