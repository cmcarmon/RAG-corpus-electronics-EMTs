The species castellanus is defined in the International Cloud Atlas, which had its last official release in 1975. It is based on ground visual observation of cloud shape. In practice, the shape of a castellanus is related to the physical process producing it: local instability (or conditional instability) at the top of the cloud that breaks the temperature inversion and is the cause of the formation of towers, this being confirmed by vertical soundings.
However, although the species castellanus applies to different genera of convective clouds at different levels, the most current cloud type is the altocumulus castellanus, the base of which is in the medium level. This is reinforced by the fact that pilot's manuals interchangeably talk about either castellanus or altocumulus castellanus, restricting the meaning of the word catellanus.
To alleviate this confusion, scientists Richard S. Scorer and Corfidi propose a cloud classification based only on physical criteria obtained from vertical soundings and observations from meteorological satellites to reclassify the castellanus as a cloud genus at the same level as a cumulus or a cirrus. Corfidi has long criticised the resistance from official bodies to this change. However, the 2016 version of the International Cloud Atlas will not change the status of the castellanus. The same scientists have a similar opinion about lenticular clouds that can exist at different levels that are not recognised as a full cloud genus but only as a species.
