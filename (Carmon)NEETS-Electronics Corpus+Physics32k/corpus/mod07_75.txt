The orbiting electrons do not follow random paths, instead they are confined to definite energy
levels. Visualize these levels as shells with each successive shell being spaced a greater distance from the
nucleus. The shells, and the number of electrons required to fill them, may be predicted by using Pauliâ€™s
exclusion principle. Simply stated, this principle specifies that each shell will contain a maximum of 2n2
electrons, where n corresponds to the shell number starting with the one closest to the nucleus. By this
principle, the second shell, for example, would contain 2(2) 2 or 8 electrons when full.
