The accident site was isolated from any main road. Only a muddy dirt lane led from the crash site to a major road two miles south and it soon became blocked by vehicles mired in the mud. The injured were either carried on stretchers or moved by hand car to the nearest road. Some waited up to four hours for help. About 100 persons were treated on the scene and 62 were transported to hospitals.
