To design a highly accurate and sensitive sensor, it is necessary to analyze the stress–strain response of the
diaphragm using plate theory and ﬁnite element techniques to take into account: (1) elastic anisotropy of the
diaphragm, (2) large deﬂections of plate (elastic non linearities), and (3) maximum sensitivity directions of the
piezoresistivity coefﬁcient. Signal conditioning must be provided to compensate for temperature drifts of the
gauge offset and sensitivity.
