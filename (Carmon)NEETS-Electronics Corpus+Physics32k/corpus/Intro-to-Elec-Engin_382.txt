4.2.18 Two three-phase generators are supplying to a
common balanced three-phase load of 30 kW at
0.8 power factor lagging. The per-phase imped-
ance of the lines connecting the generator G1 to
the load is 1.4 + j1.6 , whereas that of the
lines connecting the generator G2 to the load is
0.8 + j1 . If the generator G1, operating at a
terminal voltage of 800 V (line to line), supplies
15 kW at 0.8 power factor lagging, Ô¨Ånd the voltage
at the load terminals, the terminal voltage of the
generator G2, and the real power, as well as the
reactive power output of the generator G2.
