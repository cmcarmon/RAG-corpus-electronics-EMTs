To demonstrate the above ideas, consider a “hands-free’’ cellular radio telephone communication system. In
this system, the transmitted signal is composed of the original speech and the background noise in the car. The
background noise is generated by an engine, fan, trafﬁc, wind, etc. The transmitted signal is also affected by
the radio channel noise. As a result, noisy speech with low quality and intelligibility is delivered by such systems.
The background noise may have additional devastating effects on the performance of this system. Speciﬁcally,
if  the  system  encodes  the  signal  prior  to  its  transmission,  then  the  performance  of  the  speech  coder  may
signiﬁcantly deteriorate in the presence of the noise. The reason is that speech coders rely on some statistical
model for the clean signal, and this model becomes invalid when the signal is noisy. For a similar reason, if the
cellular radio system is equipped with a speech recognizer for automatic dialing, then the error rate of such
recognizer will be elevated in the presence of the background noise. The goals of speech enhancement in this
example  are  to  improve  perceptual  aspects  of  the  transmitted  noisy  speech  signals  as  well  as  to  reduce  the
speech recognizer error rate.
