A  common  example  is  the  reduction  of  crossover  frequency  when  the  amplitude  of  the  command  or
disturbance  signals  are  very  small.  This  reﬂects  the  human’s  indifference  to  small  errors  and  constitutes  the
principal human behavioral nonlinearity in the crossover model context. Another example occurs in measuring
  increases  with  trials  until  stable  conditions  are  obtained  for  that  particular
the  effects  of  training,  where 
subject and set of constant task and environmental conditions. Similarly, operator gain and remnant can be
modiﬁed as a consequence of changes in operator-centered variables. A notable example is the decrease in gain
and increase in remnant which accompanies alcohol ingestion.
