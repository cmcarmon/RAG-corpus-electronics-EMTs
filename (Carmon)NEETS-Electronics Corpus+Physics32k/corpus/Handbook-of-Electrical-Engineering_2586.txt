In contrast, the true MOSFET is an  enhancement-mode or normally off device. The device is normally off
because the body forms pn junctions with both the source and the drain, so no majority-carrier current can
ﬂow  between  them.  Instead,  minority-carrier  current  can  ﬂow,  provided  minority  carriers  are  available.  As
discussed later, for gate biases that are sufﬁciently attractive, above threshold, minority carriers are drawn into
a surface channel, forming a conducting path from source to drain. The gate and channel then form two sides
of a capacitor separated by the gate insulator. As additional attractive charges are placed on the gate side, the
channel side of the capacitor draws a balancing charge of minority carriers from the source and the drain. The
more charges on the gate, the more populated the channel, and the larger the conductance. Because the gate
creates the channel, to ensure electrical continuity the gate must extend over the entire length of the separation
between source and drain.
