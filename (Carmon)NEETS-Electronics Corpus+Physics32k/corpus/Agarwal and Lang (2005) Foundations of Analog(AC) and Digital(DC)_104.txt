The third constraint for circuits, however, imposes a stronger restriction
on signal timescales than for elements, because a circuit can have a much larger
physical extent than a single element. The third constraint says that the cir-
cuit must be much smaller in all its dimensions than the wavelength of light at
the highest operating frequency of interest. If this requirement is satisfied, then
wave phenomena are not important to the operation of the circuit. The circuit
operates quasistatically, and information propagates instantaneously across it.
For example, circuits operating in vacuum or air at 1 kHz, 1 MHz, and 1 GHz
would have to be much smaller than 300 km, 300 m, and 300 mm, respectively.
