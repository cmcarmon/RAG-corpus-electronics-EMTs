and drain junctions are formed by ion-implantation followed
by annealing. Common source and drain contact materials are
AuGe alloys. Popular Schottky gate metals include Al, Ti-Pt-
Au-layered structure, Pt, W, and WSi2. However, in a self-
aligned MESFET, since the source and drain implantation
and implant annealing must be performed after gate forma-
tion, refractory metals that can withstand the annealing tem-
peratures are preferred.
