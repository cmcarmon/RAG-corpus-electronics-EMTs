A surface current density J s exists at an interface only in
certain situations such as an impressed source layer, on the
surface of superconductors, and, for time-varying Ô¨Åelds, on
the surface of perfect electrical conductors (s ! 1) (Paul et al.,
1998). When J s does not exist at the interface, then from
equation 1.55:
