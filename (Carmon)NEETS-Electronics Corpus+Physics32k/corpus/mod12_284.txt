is in phase with grid voltage E1, the superimposed current through the tank circuit lags the
original tank current by 90 degrees. Both the resultant current (caused by Ip) and the tank current lag tank
voltage and current by some angle depending on the relative amplitudes of the two currents. Because this
resultant current is a lagging current, the impedance across the tank circuit cannot be at its maximum
unless something happens within the tank to bring current and voltage into phase. Therefore, this situation
continues until the frequency of oscillations in the tank circuit changes sufficiently so that the voltages
across the tank and the current flowing into it are again in phase. This action is the same as would be
produced by adding a reactance in parallel with the L1C1 tank. Because the superimposed current lags
voltage E by 90 degrees, the introduced reactance is inductive. In NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to
