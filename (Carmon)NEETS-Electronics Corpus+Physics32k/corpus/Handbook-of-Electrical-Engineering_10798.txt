, the
notion of eco-efﬁciency requires a fundamental shift in the way environment is considered in industrial activity.
Sustainable development—“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability
of  future  generations  to  meet  their  own  needs”  [World  Commission  on  Environment  and  Development,
1987]—contemplates the integration of environmental, economic, and technological considerations to achieve
continued human and economic development within the biological and physical constraints of the planet. Both
eco-efﬁciency and sustainable development provide a useful direction, yet they prove difﬁcult to operationalize
and cannot guide technology development. Thus, the theoretical foundations for integrating technology and
environment throughout the global economy are being provided by a new, multidisciplinary ﬁeld known as
industrial ecology
