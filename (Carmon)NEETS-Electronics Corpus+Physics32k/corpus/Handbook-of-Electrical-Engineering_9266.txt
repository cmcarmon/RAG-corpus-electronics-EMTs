Selecting an Optimal Series of Defect Prevention and Removal Operations
Since  most  forms  of  defect  removal  are  less  than  60%  efﬁcient,  it  is  obvious  that  more  than  a  single  defect
removal  activity  will  be  necessary  for  any  software  project.  For  mission-critical  software  systems  where  it  is
imperative to achieve a cumulative defect removal efﬁciency higher than 99%, then at least 10 discrete defect
removal  activities  should  be  utilized,  and  careful  defect  prevention  activities  should  also  be  planned  (i.e.,
prototyping, use of structured techniques, etc.).
