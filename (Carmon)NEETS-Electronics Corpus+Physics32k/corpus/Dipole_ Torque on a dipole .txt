Since the direction of an electric field is defined as the direction of the force on a positive charge, electric field lines point away from a positive charge and toward a negative charge.
When placed in an electric or magnetic field, equal but opposite forces arise on each side of the dipole creating a torque τ:

E



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {p} \times \mathbf {E} }

for an electric dipole moment p (in coulomb-meters), or

B



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {m} \times \mathbf {B} }

for a magnetic dipole moment m (in ampere-square meters).
The resulting torque will tend to align the dipole with the applied field, which in the case of an electric dipole, yields a potential energy of

{\displaystyle U=-\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {E} }

The energy of a magnetic dipole is similarly
