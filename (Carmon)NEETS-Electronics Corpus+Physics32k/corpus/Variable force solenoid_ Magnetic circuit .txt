A typical magnetic circuit is driven by a coil winding with controlled current in order to develop a magnetic flux across a working air gap. Out of necessity there is a circular air gap that can only provide radial force (also known as side loading). These two air gaps dominate the magnetic circuit reluctance. The rate of change of the working air gap stored energy provides the axial magnetic force.
