Proper design of the multivibrator will cause the frequency deviation of the carrier to faithfully
follow (referred to as a "linear" function) the modulating voltage. This is true up to frequency deviations
which are considerable fractions of the fundamental frequency of the multivibrator. The principal design
consideration is that the RC coupling from one multivibrator transistor base to the collector of the other
has a time constant which is greater than the actual gate length by a factor of 10 or more. Under these
conditions, a rise in base voltage in each transistor is essentially linear from cutoff to the bias at which the
transistor is switched on. Since this rise in base voltage is a linear function of time, the gate length will
change as an inverse function of the modulating voltage. This action will cause the frequency to change as
a linear function of the modulating voltage.
