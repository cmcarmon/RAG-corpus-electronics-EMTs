Vibrations Per Hour or VPH is a mechanical timepiece specification.
VPH describes the number of times that a vibrating timekeeping component completes a vibration cycle in 1 hour. More vibrations per hour yields higher timekeeping resolution, and usually indicates a higher precision mechanical movement.
