Historically, the term ferromagnetism was used for any material that could exhibit spontaneous magnetization: a net magnetic moment in the absence of an external magnetic field. This general definition is still in common use. More recently, however, different classes of spontaneous magnetization have been identified when there is more than one magnetic ion per primitive cell of the material, leading to a stricter definition of ferromagnetism that is often used to distinguish it from ferrimagnetism. In particular,
a material is ferromagnetic, in this narrower sense, only if all of its magnetic ions add a positive contribution to the net magnetization.
If some of the magnetic ions subtract from the net magnetization (if they are partially anti-aligned), then the material is ferrimagnetic.
If the moments of the aligned and anti-aligned ions balance completely so as to have zero net magnetization, despite the magnetic ordering, then it is antiferromagnetic.
