Linux runs mainly on the IBM-compatible PCs that are
equipped with Intel 80386/80486/Pentium CPUs. It requires
much less hardware resources than Microsoft Windows. Ports
to other architectures are underway. Linux has most standard
UNIX utilities including X-Windows and TCP/IP as well as
numerous free software that people have compiled or ported
from other architecture. There is even a DOS emulator that
can run DOS itself and some (but not all) DOS applications.
Work has been progressing on an emulator for Microsoft
Windows binaries.
