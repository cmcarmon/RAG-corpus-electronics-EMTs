In the United States, a furlough (; from Dutch: verlof, "leave of absence") is a temporary leave of employees due to special needs of a company, which may be due to economic conditions at the specific employer or in the economy as a whole. These involuntary furloughs may be short or long term, and many of those affected may seek other temporary employment during that time.
