configuration. This configuration produces a total volt-
age of 6 volts with a current twice that of an individual 
battery. It is necessary to connect the two 3-volt batteries 
in series to get the 6 volts (Figure 12-21). To increase the 
current, a second pair of 3-volt batteries is connected in 
series, and the resulting series-connected batteries are 
connected in parallel (Figure 12-22). The overall result 
is a series-parallel configuration.
