High-Frequency Response
Unlike the low-frequency response situation, the high-frequency response is governed by the small distributed
capacitances  inside  the  transistor  structure,  and  these  have  been  lumped  together  in  the  hybrid-p  model  of
Fig. 24.31 as Cb 9e and Cb9c . At high frequencies, rb9c may be neglected in comparison with the reactance of Cb9c,
so the model may be simpliÔ¨Åed as in Fig. 24.35(a). From this it will be seen that Cb9c is a capacitance which
appears from the output to the input so that it may be converted by the Miller Effect into a capacitance at the
input of value:
