One simplifying technique often used in complex circuit problems is that of breaking the
circuit into pieces of manageable size and analyzing individually the pieces that may be already
familiar. Equivalent circuits are introduced which utilize Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems to
replace a voltage source by a current source or vice versa. Nodal and loop analysis methods are then
presented. Later the principles of superposition and linearity are discussed. Also, wye–delta trans-
formation is put forth as a tool for network reduction. Finally, computer-aided circuit analyses with
SPICE and MATLAB are introduced. The chapter ends with a case study of practical application.
