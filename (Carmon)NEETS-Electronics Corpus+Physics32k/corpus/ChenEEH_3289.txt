transmission network. Both real and reactive power ﬂows play
equally important roles in determining the power ﬂow prop-
erties of the system. Power ﬂow studies are among the most
signiﬁcant computational studies carried out in power system
planning and operations in the industry. Power ﬂow equations
allow the computation of the bus voltage magnitudes and their
phase angles as well as the transmission line current magni-
tudes. In actual system operation, both the voltage and current
magnitudes need to be maintained within strict tolerances for
meeting consumer power quality requirements and for pre-
venting overheating of the transmission lines, respectively. The
difﬁculty in computing the power ﬂow solutions arises from
the fact that the equations are inherently nonlinear because of
the balancing of power quantities. Moreover, the large size of
the power network implies that power ﬂow studies involve
solving a very large number of simultaneous nonlinear equa-
tions. Fortunately, the sparse interconnected nature of the
power network reﬂects itself in the computational process,
facilitating the computational algorithms.
