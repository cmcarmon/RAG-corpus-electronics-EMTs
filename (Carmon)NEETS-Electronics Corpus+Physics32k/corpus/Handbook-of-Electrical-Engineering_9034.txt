Smaller  satellite  drops  may  be  also  produced  between  the  primary  drops.  To  eliminate  their  effect,  the
excitation  system  is  designed  to  produce  forward-merging  satellites  as  these  charge  simultaneous  with  the
preceding drop; thus the forward-merging (through “drafting”) and subsequent drop coalescence will not alter
the charge-to-mass ratio of the augmented drop.
