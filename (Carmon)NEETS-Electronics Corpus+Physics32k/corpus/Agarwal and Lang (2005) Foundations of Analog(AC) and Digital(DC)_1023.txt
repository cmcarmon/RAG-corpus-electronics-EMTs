The states of the two diodes (both ON, both OFF, and one OFF and one ON) result in
distinct piecewise linear regions of BJT operation. Both diodes (in Figure 7.49c) in their
OFF state model cutoff: when the base current iB is zero, both the diodes are OFF, and
so is the current source. Figure 7.50a depicts the corresponding BJT model in the cutoff
region. Observe that in the cutoff region
