This procedure works even for circuits with many capacitors and inductors,
linear or nonlinear, because these higher-order circuits can be formulated in
terms of a set of first-order state equations like Equation 10.80, one for each
energy-storage element (with an independent state variable) in the network.
Chapter 12 discusses such an example in Section 12.10.1.
