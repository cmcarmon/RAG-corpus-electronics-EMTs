Low-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET. 
 Because of their high reactance values, the
gate-to-source,  gate-to-drain,  and  drain-to-source  capacitances  can  be  assumed  to  be  open  circuits  at  low
frequencies. Therefore, the low-frequency large-signal model is similar to the high-frequency large-signal model,
except  that  it  has  no  capacitances.  The  resulting  circuit  describing  low-frequency  operation  is  shown  in
Fig. 22.27.
