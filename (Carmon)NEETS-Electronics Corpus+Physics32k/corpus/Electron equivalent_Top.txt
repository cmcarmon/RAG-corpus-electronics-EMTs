Electron equivalent is a concept commonly used in redox chemistry, reactions involving electron transfer, to define a quantity (e.g. energy or moles) relative to one electron. Energies of formation are often given as kilojoules per electron equivalent to enable calculation of specific reaction energies on a "per electron" basis. Reactions containing movement of electrons are often balanced such that reaction quantities are given in relation to the transfer of a single electron, allowing quantification of reactants and products in relation to a single electron transfer.
