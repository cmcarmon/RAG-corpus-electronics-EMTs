Per the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), the nomenclature AN/TPQ-53 is thus derived:
"AN/" originally indicated Army/Navy(Marines), but is now used to indicate the JETDS system.
"T" for 'transportable', indicating it is carried by a vehicle but is not an integral part of said vehicle (compare with 'V' for vehicle-mounted).
"P" indicating a RADAR.
"Q" for a special-purpose/multipurpose radar, in this case counter-battery.
"53" is the model number of this radar within the TPQ radar family.
