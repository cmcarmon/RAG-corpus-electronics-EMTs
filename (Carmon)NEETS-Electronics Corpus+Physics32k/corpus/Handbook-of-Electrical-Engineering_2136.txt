Many problems in engineering can be thought of in terms of a transformation of an input space, containing
the input, to an output space where the desired response exists. For instance, dividing data into classes can be
thought of as transforming the input into 0 and 1 responses that will code the classes [Bishop, 1995]. Likewise,
identiÔ¨Åcation of an unknown system can also be framed as a mapping (function approximation) from the input
to the system output [Kung, 1993]. The MLP is highly recommended for these applications.
