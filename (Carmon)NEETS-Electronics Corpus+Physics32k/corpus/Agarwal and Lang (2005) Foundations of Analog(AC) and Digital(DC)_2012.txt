This section analyzed the total response of the resonant circuit. How-
ever, as mentioned earlier, we tend to be less interested in the total response,
and more concerned with the particular solution or the steady-state response.
Accordingly, Section 14.2 will analyze the steady state response of Equa-
tion 14.19 in more detail.
It will also show how to draw the frequency
response plot for quadratic roots, and revisit the parameters Q, α, ωo,
and ωd, the stalwarts of second-order systems,
from a frequency point of
view. The frequency response plot of our parallel resonant circuit will show
vividly the filtering that occurs when a signal is passed through the resonant
circuit.
