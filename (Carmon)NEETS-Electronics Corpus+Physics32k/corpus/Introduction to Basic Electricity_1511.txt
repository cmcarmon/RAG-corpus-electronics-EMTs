converts to water. Recharging the cell involves applying 
a source of DC voltage greater than that produced by 
the cell. As the current flows through the cell, it changes 
the electrode back to lead peroxide and spongy lead 
and converts the electrolyte back to sulfuric acid and 
water. This type of cell is also referred to as a wet cell.
