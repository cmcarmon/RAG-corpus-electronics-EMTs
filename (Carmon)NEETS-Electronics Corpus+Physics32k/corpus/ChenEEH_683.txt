From the process technology point of view, this problem is
not so surprising, especially for submicron technologies. The
relative power cost of interconnections is increasing rapidly
compared to the transistor (active circuit) related components.
Clearly, local data paths, and controllers themselves contribute
little to this overall interconnect compared to the major data/
instruction busses and the internal connections in the large
memories. Hence, if all other parameters remain constant, the
energy consumption (and also the delay or area) in the storage
and transfer organization will become even more dominant in
the future, especially for deep submicron technologies. The
remaining basic limitation lies in transporting the data and
the control (like addresses and internal signals) over large
on-chip distances and in storing them.
