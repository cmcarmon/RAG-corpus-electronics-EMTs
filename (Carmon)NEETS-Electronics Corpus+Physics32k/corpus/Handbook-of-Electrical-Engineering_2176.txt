Associative Memories
Hebbian learning is also the rule to create associative memories [Zurada, 1992]. The most-utilized associative memory
implements heteroassociation, where the system is able to associate an input X to a designated output Y which can
be of a different dimension (Fig. 20.15). So, in heteroassociation the signal Y works as the desired response.
