then equations 9.92a through 9.92d describe an absorbing
medium that is impedance-matched to region 1 for normally
incident plane waves.
y ¼ 0, the medium can absorb a plane wave having
sy ¼ s
ﬁeld components (Ey, Hzx) propagating along x, but it does
not absorb a wave having ﬁeld components (Ex, Hzy) propa-
gating along y, since in the ﬁrst case propagation is governed
by equations 9.92b and 9.92c and in the second case by equa-
tions 9.92a and 9.92d. The converse situation is true for waves
(Ey, Hzx) and (Ex, Hzy) if sx ¼ s
particular Berenger media characterized by the pairwise pa-
rameter sets (sx, s
y ) are closely related
to the fundamental premise of this novel ABC, as proved later
in this chapter. That is, if the pairwise electric and magnetic
losses satisfy equation 9.94, then at interfaces normal to x and
y, respectively, the Berenger media have zero reﬂection of
electromagnetic waves.
