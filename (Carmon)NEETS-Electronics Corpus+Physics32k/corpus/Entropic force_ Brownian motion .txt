The entropic approach to Brownian movement was initially proposed by R. M. Neumann. Neumann derived the entropic force for a particle undergoing three-dimensional Brownian motion using the Boltzmann equation, denoting this force as a diffusional driving force or radial force. In the paper, three example systems are shown to exhibit such a force:
electrostatic system of molten salt
surface tension and
Elasticity of rubber.
