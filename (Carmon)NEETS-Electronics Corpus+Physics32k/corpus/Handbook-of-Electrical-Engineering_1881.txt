Heterogeneous  multiprocessors  will  continue  to  dominate  high-volume,  low-cost  markets  for  video  and
multimedia  functions.  When  an  application  is  well-deﬁned,  it  is  often  possible  to  design  a  special-purpose
architecture that performs only that operation but is signiﬁcantly cheaper than a system built from a program-
mable  processor.  Furthermore,  heterogeneous  multiprocessors  may  require  signiﬁcantly  less  power  than  pro-
grammable solutions and, therefore, an increasing number of battery-operated multimedia devices. However,
heterogeneous multiprocessors are not well-suited to other application areas. If the algorithm is not well-deﬁned,
if the system must be able to execute a variety of algorithms, or if the size of the market will not support the
cost of designing an application-speciﬁc solution, heterogeneous multiprocessors are not appropriate.
