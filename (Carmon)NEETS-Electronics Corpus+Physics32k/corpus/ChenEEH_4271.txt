. each user has a predeÔ¨Åned time slot. However, users
roaming from one cell to another are not allotted a time
slot. Thus, if all the time slots in the next cell are already
occupied, a call might well be disconnected. Likewise, if all
the time slots in the cell in which a user happens to be are
already occupied, a user will not receive a dial tone.
