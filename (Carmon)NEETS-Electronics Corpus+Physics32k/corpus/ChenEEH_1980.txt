Improvements have been proposed to reduce the hardware
complexity of the WD: justifying signatures or using the em-
bedded signature for the computation of the concurrent one.
These were proposed to make the concurrent computed signa-
ture all zeros at the end of a node; thus, a simple gate instead of
the comparator can be used for the checking.
