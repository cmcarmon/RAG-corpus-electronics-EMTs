This chapter describes UMA as one of the emerging applica-
tions of multimedia systems and signal processing. In particu-
lar, it describes how different multimedia systems and signal
processing tools use MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 for enabling
UMA. Section 5.2 describes the MPEG-7 support for UMA,
which includes transcoding hints and variations descriptions.
Section 5.3 describes the MPEG-21 support for UMA, which
includes digital item adaptation. Section 5.4 describes how
transcoding of images can be optimized using MPEG-7 trans-
coding hints. Section 5.5 describes a method for the optimized
selection of media resources, which applies to MPEG-7 vari-
ations and MPEG-21 digital items.
