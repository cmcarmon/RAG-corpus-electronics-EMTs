The energy that a distant object reflects back to the antenna in a radar system is a very small fraction
of the original transmitted energy. The echoes return as pulses of rf energy of the same nature as those
sent out by the transmitter. However, the power of a return pulse is measured in fractions of microwatts
instead of in kilowatts, and the voltage arriving at the antenna is in the range of microvolts instead of
kilovolts. The radar receiver collects those pulses and provides a visual display of object information.
