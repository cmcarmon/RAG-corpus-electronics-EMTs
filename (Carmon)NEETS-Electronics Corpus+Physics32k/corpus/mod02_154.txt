The third factor affecting capacitance is the DIELECTRIC CONSTANT of the insulating material
between the plates of a capacitor. The various insulating materials used as the dielectric in a capacitor differ
in their ability to respond to (pass) electrostatic lines of force. A dielectric material, or insulator, is rated as
to its ability to respond to electrostatic lines of force in terms of a figure called the DIELECTRIC
CONSTANT. A dielectric material with a high dielectric constant is a better insulator than a dielectric
material with a low dielectric constant. Dielectric constants for some common materials are given in the
following list:
