Although the presentation in this chapter will follow the steps
outlined above, many other methods of exposition are pos-
sible. The reader should be aware of this whenever consulting
the various textbooks available on electromagnetic theory.
It must be emphasized that apart from the fundamental
governing Maxwell equations and the constitutive relations
connecting the various ﬁeld quantities, almost anything that
the author of this chapter adds is a matter of opinion or
philosophy. This is most evident when the issue of the ‘‘funda-
mentality’’ of a ﬁeld is brought up. The viewpoint adopted
here is that electrostatics is the specialization of Maxwell’s
equations to elucidate the behavior of the electric ﬁelds in
the case of no time variation or zero frequency. This idea
is exempliﬁed when equations 2.1 (written in their most
conventional form and using the Lorentz Gauge) become
equations 2.2.
