The schematic diagram and the volt–ampere characteristic of a dc series generator at constant
speed are shown in Figure 13.4.6. The resistance of the series-ﬁeld winding must be low for
efﬁciency as well as for low voltage drop. The series generator was used in early constant-current
systems by operating in the range B–C, where the terminal voltage fell off very rapidly with
increasing current.
