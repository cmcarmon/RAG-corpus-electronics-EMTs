In the special case where the input signal is small compared to the saturation intensity, in other words,





I

n


≪

I

S





{\displaystyle I_{in}\ll I_{S}\,}

then the general gain equation gives the small signal gain as

{\displaystyle \ln(G)=\ln(G_{0})=\gamma _{0}(\nu )\cdot z}

or




G

{\displaystyle G=G_{0}=e^{\gamma _{0}(\nu )z}}

which is identical to the small signal gain equation (see above).
