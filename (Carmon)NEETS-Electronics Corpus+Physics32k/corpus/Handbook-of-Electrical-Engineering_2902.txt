Water-soluble ﬂuxes are designed to be cleaned with pure water. They remain active at room temperatures,
 be cleaned when used. Beyond their activity, the other disadvantage to water soluble ﬂuxes
and therefore 
is  that  their  higher  surface  tension  relative  to  solvent-based  cleaners  means  there  is  more  difﬁculty  cleaning
under low-clearance components.
