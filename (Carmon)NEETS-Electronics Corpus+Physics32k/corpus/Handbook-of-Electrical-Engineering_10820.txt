The electronics industry has taken active steps toward environmental stewardship, evidenced by the formu-
lation of the IEEE Environment, Safety and Health Committee, the 1996 Electronics Industry Environmental
Roadmap published by MCC, and chapters focused on environment in The National Technology Roadmap for
Semiconductors. Moves such as this, taken together with the technical sophistication of control systems used
in manufacturing processes, have allowed the electronics industry to maintain low emission levels relative to
some other industries. Despite the industryâ€™s environmental actions, the projected growth in electronics over
the  next  10  to  20  years  is  dramatic  and  continued  technological  innovation  will  be  required  to  maintain
historically low environmental impacts. Moreover, the rapid pace of technological change generates concomi-
tantly high rates of product obsolescence and disposal, a factor that has led countries such as Germany and the
Netherlands to focus on electronics products for environmental management.
