Geophysical methods are used in geotechnical investigations to evaluate a site's behavior in a seismic event. By measuring a soil's shear wave velocity, the dynamic response of that soil can be estimated. There are a number of methods used to determine a site's shear wave velocity:
Crosshole method
Downhole method (with a seismic CPT or a substitute device)
Surface wave reflection or refraction
Suspension logging (also known as P-S logging or Oyo logging)
Spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW)
Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW)
Refraction microtremor (ReMi)
Other methods:
Electromagnetic (radar, resistivity)
Optical/acoustic televiewer survey
