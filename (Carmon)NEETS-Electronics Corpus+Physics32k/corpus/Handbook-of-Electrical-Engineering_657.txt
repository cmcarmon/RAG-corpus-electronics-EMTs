Representation of Bandpass Systems
Let the bandpass input signal x(t) be applied to a linear time-invariant bandpass system with impulse response
h(t), and let the bandwidth of the bandpass system be equal to 2B and centered about the carrier frequency fc.
Then, by analogy with the representation of bandpass signals, the impulse response of the bandpass system can
also be expressed in terms of a slowly varying complex impulse response Ëœh(t) and a complex exponential:
