12.1.9 Figure E12.1.1 can also be considered as a simple
model of a magnetically operated relay that is
commonly used for the automatic control and
protection of electric equipment. Consider the
core and armature (shown as “Bar” in Figure
E12.1.1) of the relay to be constructed out of
inﬁnitely permeable magnetic material. The core
has a circular cross section and is 1.25 cm in
diameter, while the armature has a rectangular
cross section. The armature is so supported that
the two air gaps are always equal and of uniform
length over their areas. A spring (not shown in
the ﬁgure), whose force opposes the magnetic
pull, restrains the motion of the armature. If the
operating coil has 1800 turns carrying a current
of 1 A, and the gaps are set at 0.125 cm each, ﬁnd
the pull that must be exerted by the spring. You
may neglect leakage and fringing.
