Since we know that vi is small compared to VI, we can adopt the following
linearization technique to obtain the combined response: Model the MOSFET
characteristic curve accurately only in the vicinity of the bias point VI and dis-
regard the rest of the curve. The Taylor series expansion is the natural tool for
this task.
The Taylor series expansion for the function y = f (x) in the vicinity of
x = Xo is given by:
