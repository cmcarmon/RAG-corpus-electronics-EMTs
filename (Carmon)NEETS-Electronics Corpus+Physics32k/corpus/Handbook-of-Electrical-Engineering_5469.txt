Economic Comparison of AC 
and DC Transmission
In  cases  where  HVDC  is  selected  on  technical  consider-
ations, it may be the only practical option, as in the case of
an  asynchronous  interconnection.  However,  for  long-dis-
tance  power  transmission,  where  both  ac  and  HVDC  are
practical,  the  Ô¨Ånal  decision  is  dependent  on  total  costs  of
each alternative. Total cost of a transmission system includes
the line costs (conductors, insulators, and towers) plus the
right-of-way (R-o-W) costs. A dc line with two conductors
can carry almost the same amount of power as the three-
phase ac line with the same size of line conductors. How-
ever, dc towers with only two conductors are simpler and
cheaper  than  three-phase  ac  towers.  Hence  the  per-mile
costs of line and R-o-W will be lower for a dc line. Power
losses in the dc line are also lower than for ac for the same
power  transmitted.  However,  the  HVDC  system  requires
converters at the two ends of the line; hence the terminal costs for dc are higher than for ac. Variation of total
costs for ac and dc as a function of line length are shown in Fig. 61.12. There is a break-even distance above
which the total costs of dc option will be lower than the ac transmission option. This is in the range of 500 to
800 km for overhead lines but much shorter for cables. It is between 20 and 50 km for submarine cables and
twice as far for underground cables.
