For long-term recordings, as in seizure monitoring, electrodes present major problems. Needle electrodes,
which must be inserted into the tissue between the surface of the scalp and skull, are sometimes useful. However,
the danger of infection increases signiﬁcantly. Electrodes with self-contained miniature ampliﬁers are somewhat
more tolerant because they provide a low-impedance source to interconnecting leads, but they are expensive.
Despite numerous attempts to simplify the electrode application process and to guarantee long-term stability,
none has been widely accepted.
