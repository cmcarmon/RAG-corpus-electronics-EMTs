We now discuss the reprocessing with micro delays (REMOD)
technique for designing FT arithmetic circuits that can detect
errors and reconÔ¨Ågure around the fault for correct operation
(Dutt and Hanchek, 1997). REMOD has much smaller time
overheads than RESO and REDWC, and its hardware and
time overheads are typically less than or comparable to
methods that are only 1-FD, such as duplication or informa-
tion redundancy.
