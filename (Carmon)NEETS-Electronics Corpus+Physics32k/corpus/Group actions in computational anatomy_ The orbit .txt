The central model of human anatomy in computational anatomy is a Groups and group action, a classic formulation from differential geometry. The orbit is called the space of shapes and forms. The space of shapes are denoted



m
∈


M




{\displaystyle m\in {\mathcal {M}}}
, with the group



(


G


,
∘
)


{\displaystyle ({\mathcal {G}},\circ )}
with law of composition



∘


{\displaystyle \circ }
; the action of the group on shapes is denoted



g
⋅
m


{\displaystyle g\cdot m}
, where the action of the group

m

{\displaystyle g\cdot m\in {\mathcal {M}},m\in {\mathcal {M}}}
is defined to satisfy

{\displaystyle (g\circ g^{\prime })\cdot m=g\cdot (g^{\prime }\cdot m)\in {\mathcal {M}}.}
