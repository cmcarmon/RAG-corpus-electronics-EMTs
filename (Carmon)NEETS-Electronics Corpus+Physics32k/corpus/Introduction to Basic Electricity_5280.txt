The voltmeter function of a multimeter (Figure 50-2)  
is useful for measuring the voltage drop across a com-
ponent without removing it from the circuit. Due to 
the loading effect of a voltmeter because it is inserted 
in parallel across the component, the voltage reading 
may be in error. The loading resistance of a voltmeter 
should be 20 MÎ©/volt to minimize the loading effect.
