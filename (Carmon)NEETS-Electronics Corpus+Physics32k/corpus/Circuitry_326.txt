Conclusion 
Comment on the shape of each graph. Is this what 
you  would  expect?  Compare  the  performance  of 
each  circuit  and,  in  particular,  the  range  of  load 
currents  over  which  effective 
is 
achieved.  Which  of  the  transistors  had  the  lowest 
value  of  output  resistance?  Can  you  suggest  why 
this is?
