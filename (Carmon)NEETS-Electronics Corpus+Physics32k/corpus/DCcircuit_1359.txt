The measure of an inductor’s ability to store energy for a given amount of current ﬂow is
called inductance. Not surprisingly, inductance is also a measure of the intensity of opposition
to changes in current (exactly how much self-induced voltage will be produced for a given rate
of change of current). Inductance is symbolically denoted with a capital ”L,” and is measured
in the unit of the Henry, abbreviated as ”H.”
