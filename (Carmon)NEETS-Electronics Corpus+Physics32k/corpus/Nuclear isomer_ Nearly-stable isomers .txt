Most nuclear excited states are very unstable and "immediately" radiate away the extra energy after existing on the order of 10−12 seconds. As a result, the characterization "nuclear isomer" is usually applied only to configurations with half-lives of 10−9 seconds or longer. Quantum mechanics predicts that certain atomic species will possess isomers with unusually long lifetimes even by this stricter standard and have interesting properties. Some nuclear isomers are so long-lived that they are relatively stable and can be produced and observed in quantity.
The most stable nuclear isomer occurring in nature is 180m73Ta which is present in all tantalum samples at about 1 part in 8,300. Its half-life is at least 1015 years, markedly longer than the age of the universe. The low excitation energy of the isomeric state causes both gamma de-excitation to the 180Ta ground state (which itself is radioactive by beta decay, with a half-life of only 8 hours) and direct beta decay to hafnium or tungsten to be suppressed due to spin mismatches. The origin of this isomer is mysterious, though it is believed to have been formed in supernovae (as are most other heavy elements). Were it to relax to its ground state, it would release a photon with a photon energy of 75 keV.
It was first reported in 1988 by Collins that 180mTa can be forced to release its energy by weaker X-rays. This way of de-excitation had never been observed; however, the de-excitation of 180mTa via resonant photo-excitation of intermediate high levels of this nucleus (E~1 MeV) was found in 1999 by Belic and co-workers in the Stuttgart nuclear physics group.
178m272Hf is another reasonably stable nuclear isomer which possesses a half-life of 31 years and the highest excitation energy of any comparably long-lived isomer. One gram of pure 178m2Hf contains approximately 1.33 gigajoules of energy, the equivalent of exploding about 315 kg (694 lb) of TNT. In the natural decay of 178m2Hf, the energy is released as gamma rays with a total energy of 2.45 MeV. As with 180mTa, there are disputed reports that 178m2Hf can be stimulated into releasing its energy. Due to this, the substance is being studied as a possible source for gamma ray lasers. These reports indicate that the energy is released very quickly, so that 178m2Hf can produce extremely high powers (on the order of exawatts). Other isomers have also been investigated as possible media for gamma-ray stimulated emission.
Holmium's nuclear isomer, 166m167Ho has a half-life of 1,200 years, which is nearly the longest half-life of any holmium radionuclide. Only 163Ho, with a half-life of 4,570 years, is longer.
22990Th has a remarkably low-lying metastable isomer, estimated at only 7.8±0.5 eV above the ground state. After years of failure and one notable false alarm, this decay was directly observed in 2016, producing a gamma ray (defined by its origin, not its wavelength) in the ultraviolet range. The observed energy was between 6.3 and 18.3 eV (200–70 nm). The range is broad because the experiment was optimized for detection rather than precision measurement.
