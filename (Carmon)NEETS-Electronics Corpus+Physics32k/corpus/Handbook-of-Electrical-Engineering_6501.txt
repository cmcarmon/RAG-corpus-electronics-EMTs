A photodetector converts the incident optical power into current. Broadband InGaAs photodetectors with
) of nearly 1.0 A/W and bandwidths greater than 10 GHz are available. The detector generates
responsivities (R
0
 and the complete RF modulation spectrum
L
a dc current corresponding to the average received optical power 
r
that was applied at the transmitter. An ac-coupled electronic preampliÔ¨Åer is used to remove the dc component
and boost the signal to usable levels.
