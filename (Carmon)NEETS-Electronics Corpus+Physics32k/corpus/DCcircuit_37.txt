of this attraction/repulsion behavior between individual particles, electrons and protons are
said to have opposite electric charges. That is, each electron has a negative charge, and each
proton a positive charge. In equal numbers within an atom, they counteract each other’s pres-
ence so that the net charge within the atom is zero. This is why the picture of a carbon atom
had six electrons: to balance out the electric charge of the six protons in the nucleus. If elec-
trons leave or extra electrons arrive, the atom’s net electric charge will be imbalanced, leaving
the atom ”charged” as a whole, causing it to interact with charged particles and other charged
atoms nearby. Neutrons are neither attracted to or repelled by electrons, protons, or even other
neutrons, and are consequently categorized as having no charge at all.
