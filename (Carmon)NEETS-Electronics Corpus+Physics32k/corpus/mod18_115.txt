The two basic methods of beam scanning are MECHANICAL and ELECTRONIC. In mechanical
scanning, the beam can be moved in various ways: (1) The entire antenna can be moved in the desired
pattern; (2) the energy feed source can be moved relative to a fixed reflector; or (3) the reflector can be
moved relative to a fixed source. In electronic scanning, the beam is effectively moved by such means as
(1) switching between a set of feeder sources, (2) varying the phasing between elements in a multielement
array, or (3) comparing the amplitude and phase differences between signals received by a multielement
array. A combination of mechanical and electronic scanning is also used in some antenna systems.
