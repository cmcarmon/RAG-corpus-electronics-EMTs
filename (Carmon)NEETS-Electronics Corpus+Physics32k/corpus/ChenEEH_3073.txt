It may be desirable to create an electrical connection
between systems that have different phase angles. These
systems may also be at different voltages. The function of
the phaseâ€“angle regulator is to provide this interconnection
between systems possessing different phase angles and volt-
ages. Figure 3.4 illustrates one method to accomplish this
transformation.
