Up to now we have been discussing computer OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS and HARDWARE (the 
computer and its peripheral devices), and how these devices work and communicate with each other. 
What about this thing called SOFTWARE? Do we really need it? We most certainly do! Software plays a 
major role in computer data processing. For example, without software, the computer could not perform 
simple addition. It's the software that makes everything happen. Or putting it another way, software 
brings the computer to life.
