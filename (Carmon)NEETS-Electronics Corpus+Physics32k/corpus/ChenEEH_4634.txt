parameter uncertainty) or can be formed through linearization
of a nonlinear plant. Given the latter interpretation, a gain-
scheduled controller can be designed for the LPV system using
the approach described in Section 9.2. The inherent structure
of the LPV system, however, lends itself to the application of
linear robust control design methods, and recent theoretical
results have led to gain-scheduled controller synthesis ap-
proaches for LPV systems that form the controller and sched-
uling law directly.
