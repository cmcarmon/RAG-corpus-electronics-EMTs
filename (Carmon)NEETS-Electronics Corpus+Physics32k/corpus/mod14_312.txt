Figure 3-9 uses STANDARD SYMBOLS to show a parallel adder capable of adding two, two-digit
binary numbers. In previous discussions we have depicted circuits with individual logic gates shown.
Standard symbols (blocks) allow us to analyze circuits with inputs and outputs only. One standard symbol
may actually contain many and various types of gates and circuits. The addend would be input on the A
inputs (A2 = MSD, A1 = LSD), and the augend input on the B inputs (B2 = MSD, B1  = LSD). For this
explanation we will assume there is no input to C0 (carry from a previous circuit).
