You might wonder exactly how the gain and bandwidth of a closed-loop, operational-amplifier
circuit are related. Figure 3-18 should help to show you the relationship. The frequency-response curve
shown in figure 3-18 is for a circuit in which degenerative feedback has been used to decrease the circuit
gain to 100 (from 100,000 for the operational amplifier). Notice that the half-power point of this curve is
just slightly above 10 kilohertz.
