(c) Determine the two possible SSB AM signals
*15.2.27 Let the message signal m(t ) = α cos (2πfmt )
be used to either frequency-modulate or phase-
modulate the carrier Ac cos(2πfct ). Find the mod-
ulated signal in each case.
is given by sFM(t ) = 100
15.2.28 If an FM signal
cos [2πfct + 100
t−∞ m(τ ) dτ ] and m(t) is given
in Figure P15.2.28, sketch the instantaneous fre-
quency as a function of time and determine the
peak frequency deviation.
15.2.29 If m(t) of Figure P15.2.29 is fed into an FM modu-
lator with peak frequency deviation kf = 25 Hz/V,
plot the frequency deviation in hertz and the phase
deviation in radians.
