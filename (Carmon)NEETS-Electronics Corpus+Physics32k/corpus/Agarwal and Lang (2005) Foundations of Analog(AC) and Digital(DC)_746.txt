A truth table illustrating several of these functions is shown in Table 5.8.
Each output column in the truth table corresponds to the given boolean
function.
Gates can have multiple inputs. For example, we can have a four-input AND
gate that implements the function E = A · B · C · D as shown in Figure 5.15.
As shown in Figure 5.16, we can combine digital gates using wires
thereby creating more complicated boolean
