The  voltage  N(t)  generated  thermally  between  two  points  in  an  open  circuit  conductor  is  the  sum  of  an
extremely large number of superimposed, independent electronically and ionically induced microvoltages at
all frequencies up to fc = 6,000 GHz at room temperature [see Gardner 1990, p. 235], near infrared. The mean
relaxation  time  of  free  electrons  is  1/fc  =  0.5 ·  10–10/T  s,  so  at  room  temperature  of T  =  290K,  it  is  0.17  ps
(1 picosecond  =  10–12  s).  The  values  of  N(t)  at  different  times  are  uncorrelated  for  time  differences  (offsets)
greater than t
c = 1/fc . The expected value of N(t) is zero. The power is fairly constant across a broad spectrum,
and  we  cannot  sample  signals  at  picosecond  periods,  so  we  model  Johnson  noise  N(t)  with  Gaussian  white
noise W(t). Although m = E[W(t)] = 0, the average power is positive at temperatures above 0K, and is s
2 =
W
RWW (0) [see the right side of Eq. (73.21)]. A disadvantage of the white noise model is its inﬁnite power, i.e.,
RWW(0) = s
