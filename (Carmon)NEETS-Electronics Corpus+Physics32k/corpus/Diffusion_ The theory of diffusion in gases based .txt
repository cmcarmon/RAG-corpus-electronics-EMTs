In Boltzmann's kinetics of the mixture of gases, each gas has its own distribution function,




f

i


(
x
,
c
,
t
)


{\displaystyle f_{i}(x,c,t)}
, where t is the time moment, x is position and c is velocity of molecule of the ith component of the mixture. Each component has its mean velocity

In the Chapman–Enskog approximation, all the distribution functions are expressed through the densities of the conserved quantities:

The coefficient D12 is positive. This is the diffusion coefficient. Four terms in the formula for C1-C2 describe four main effects in the diffusion of gases:




∇


(



n

n

{\displaystyle \nabla \,\left({\frac {n_{1}}{n}}\right)}
describes the flux of the first component from the areas with the high ratio n1/n to the areas with lower values of this ratio (and, analogously the flux of the second component from high n2/n to low n2/n because n2/n = 1 – n1/n);

{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{1}n_{1}m_{2}n_{2}}{P(m_{1}n_{1}+m_{2}n_{2})}}(F_{1}-F_{2})}
describes diffusion caused by the difference of the forces applied to molecules of different types. For example, in the Earth's gravitational field, the heavier molecules should go down, or in electric field the charged molecules should move, until this effect is not equilibrated by the sum of other terms. This effect should not be confused with barodiffusion caused by the pressure gradient.

∇
T


{\displaystyle k_{T}{\frac {1}{T}}\nabla T}
describes thermodiffusion, the diffusion flux caused by the temperature gradient.
All these effects are called diffusion because they describe the differences between velocities of different components in the mixture. Therefore, these effects cannot be described as a bulk transport and differ from advection or convection.

We can see that the dependence on T for the rigid spheres is the same as for the simple mean free path theory but for the power repulsion laws the exponent is different. Dependence on a total concentration n for a given temperature has always the same character, 1/n.
In applications to gas dynamics, the diffusion flux and the bulk flow should be joined in one system of transport equations. The bulk flow describes the mass transfer. Its velocity V is the mass average velocity. It is defined through the momentum density and the mass concentrations:




V
=




∑

i



ρ

C

ρ



.


{\displaystyle V={\frac {\sum _{i}\rho _{i}C_{i}}{\rho }}\,.}

where




ρ

=

{\displaystyle \rho _{i}=m_{i}n_{i}}
is the mass concentration of the ith species,



ρ
=

∑

i



ρ

i




{\displaystyle \rho =\sum _{i}\rho _{i}}
is the mass density.
By definition, the diffusion velocity of the ith component is




v

{\displaystyle v_{i}=C_{i}-V}
,




∑

i



ρ

i



v

i


=

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}\rho _{i}v_{i}=0}
. The mass transfer of the ith component is described by the continuity equation

{\displaystyle W_{i}}
is the net mass production rate in chemical reactions,




∑

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}W_{i}=0}

In these equations, the term

{\displaystyle \nabla (\rho _{i}v_{i})}

In 1948, Wendell H. Furry proposed to use the form of the diffusion rates found in kinetic theory as a framework for the new phenomenological approach to diffusion in gases. This approach was developed further by F.A. Williams and S.H. Lam. For the diffusion velocities in multicomponent gases (N components) they used
