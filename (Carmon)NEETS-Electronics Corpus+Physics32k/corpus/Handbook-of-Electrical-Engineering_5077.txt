wire electrodes immersed in the test solution and the current which is generated by the reduction/oxidation
reaction of the species of interest is measured. The current is proportional to the concentration of the reduc-
ing/oxidizing species. A selective response is obtained if no other available species has a lower redox potential.
Because the selectivity of peroxide over oxygen is poor, some glucose sensing schemes employ a second enzyme
called catalase which converts peroxide to oxygen and hydroxyl ions. The latter produces a change in the local
pH.  As  described  earlier,  an  ISE  can  then  be  used  to  convert  the  pH  to  a  measurable  voltage.  In  this  latter
example, glucose sensing involves two chemical-to-chemical transductions followed by a chemical-to-electrical
transduction mechanism.
