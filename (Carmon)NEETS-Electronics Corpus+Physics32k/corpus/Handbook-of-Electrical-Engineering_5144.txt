Alhough the exact mechanism by which the shape-memory effect occurs is still under study, the process by which
the original shape is regained is associated with a reverse transformation of the deformed martensitic phase to the
higher temperature austenite phase. A group of nickel-titanium alloys (referred to as Nitinol) of proper composition
 
exhibit the shape-memory property and are widely used in smart material applications [Jackson et al.,
