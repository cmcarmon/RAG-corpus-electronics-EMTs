Vertical resolution depends on the number of horizontal scan lines used by the particular display 
raster. Generally, the greater the number of scan lines, the easier it is to resolve a horizontal line of 
display. This characteristic remains true up to a point, called the merge point, where the variation between 
the lines cannot be detected by the human eye.
