Now consider the small-signal current gain. Because the value of hFE is not quite linear on the IC /IB graph,
its slope too must be used for small-signal work. However, the departure from linearity is not great over normal
working conditions, and the small-signal value hfe is usually quite close to that of hFE. Hence,
