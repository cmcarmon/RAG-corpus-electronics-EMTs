)  which  is  the  ratio  of  the  lumens  reaching  the  working
plane to the total lumens generated by the lamps. This is a factor that takes into account the efﬁciency
and the distribution of the luminaire, its mounting height, the room proportions, and the reﬂectances
of the walls, ceiling, and ﬂoor. Rooms are classiﬁed according to shape by 10 room cavity numbers. The
cavity  ratio  can  be  calculated  using  the  formula  given  in  Eq.  (107.1).  The  coefﬁcient  of  utilization  is
selected from tables prepared for various luminaires by manufacturers.
