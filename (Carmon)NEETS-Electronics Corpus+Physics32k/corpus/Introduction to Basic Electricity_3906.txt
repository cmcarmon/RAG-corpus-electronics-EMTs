The differential amplifier is generally not used to ob-
tain an output between output and ground. The output 
signal is usually obtained between output A and output 
B. Because the two outputs are 180Â° out of phase, a sub-
stantial output voltage is developed between the two 
points. The input signal can be applied to either input.
