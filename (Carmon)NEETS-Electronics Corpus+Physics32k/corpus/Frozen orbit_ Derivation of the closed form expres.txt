The main perturbing force to be counter-acted to have a frozen orbit is the "

force", i.e. the gravitational force caused by an imperfect symmetry north/south of the Earth, and the "classical theory" is based on the closed form expression for this "




J

{\displaystyle J_{3}\,}
perturbation". With the "modern theory" this explicit closed form expression is not directly used but it is certainly still worthwhile to derive it.
The derivation of this expression can be done as follows:
The potential from a zonal term is rotational symmetric around the polar axis of the Earth and corresponding force is entirely in a longitudial plane with one component
