There are two main model schemes that can represent cloud physics, the most common is bulk microphysics models that uses mean values to describe the cloud properties (e.g. rain water content, ice content), the properties can represent only the first order (concentration) or also the second order (mass). The second option is to use bin microphysics scheme that keep the moments (mass or concentration) in different for different size of particles. The bulk microphysics models are much faster than the bin models but are less accurate.
