A gyro can have different degrees of freedom, depending on the number of gimbals in which it is 
supported and the way the gimbals are arranged. Do not confuse the term "degrees of freedom" with an 
angular value such as degrees of a circle. The term, as it applies to gyros, is an indication of the number of 
axes about which the rotor is free to precess.
