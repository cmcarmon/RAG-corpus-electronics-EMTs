coaxial cables, and optical-Ô¨Åber cables, used in most LANs. Unbounded media, such as the
atmosphere, the ocean, and outer space in which the transmission is wireless, use infrared radiation,
lasers, microwave radiation, radio waves, and satellites. Data are transmitted from one node to
another through various transmission media in computer communications networks.
