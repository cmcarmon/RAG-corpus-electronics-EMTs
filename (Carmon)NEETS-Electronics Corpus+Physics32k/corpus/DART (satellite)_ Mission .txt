DART was launched on a Pegasus rocket into a polar circular parking orbit of 760 km × 770 km (472 mi × 478 mi) and has International Designator 2005-014-A. The craft is 2 by 1 metre (7 by 3 feet) and weighs 360 kg (790 lb). The maneuvering system comprised 16 nitrogen-fueled thrusters with three hydrazine-fueled thrusters and a reaction control system including six nitrogen-fueled thrusters from the Pegasus fourth stage, which forms an integral part of the craft. The target spacecraft was an OSC MUBLCOM (Multiple-Path Beyond-Line-of-Sight Communications) prototype communications relay satellite weighing approximately 49 kg (108 lb) launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base on 18 May 1999 with International Designator 1999-026-B.

After launch, DART successfully achieved orbit and within hours made a rendezvous with the target satellite. The automated systems aboard DART successfully acquired the target and began autonomously approaching it. During proximity operations, multiple malfunctions in navigation, propellant management and collision avoidance programming led to a soft collision with the target and premature departure and retirement of the DART spacecraft.
DART had no capability for interactive piloting from the ground or for uploading new programming after launch, thus all on-orbit operations were directed by DART itself based upon pre-programmed criteria.
The initial mission was to occur over about 24 hours but its premature failure occurred after only about 11 hours.
The launch originally scheduled for October 25, 2004, but this was postponed for launch loads analysis and instead performed April 15, 2005.
