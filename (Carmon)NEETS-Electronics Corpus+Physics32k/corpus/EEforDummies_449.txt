Likewise, the larger the capacitance, the more charges it takes to fill the 
capacitor plates, so the longer it takes to charge the capacitor. During the 
discharge cycle, a larger resistor slows down the electrons more as they 
move from one plate to the other, increasing the discharge time, and a larger 
capacitor holds more charge, taking longer to discharge.
