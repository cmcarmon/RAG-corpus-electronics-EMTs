Up to this point, we have covered various factors that control the propagation of radio waves through 
the ionosphere, such as the structure of the ionosphere, the incidence angle of radio waves, operating 
frequencies, etc. There is a very good reason for studying radio wave propagation. You must have a 
thorough knowledge of radio wave propagation to exercise good judgment when you select transmitting 
and receiving antennas and operating frequencies. Selection of a suitable operating frequency (within the 
bounds of frequency allocations and availability) is of prime importance in maintaining reliable 
communications.
