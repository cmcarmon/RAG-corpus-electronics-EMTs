A. Behavioral Speciﬁcation of Function: The behavioral speciﬁcation is essentially a description of the func-
tion expected to be performed by the IC. The design can be represented by schematic capture, with the
designer representing the design using block diagrams. High-level description languages (HDLs) such
as VHDL [Armstrong, 1989; Lipsett et al., 1990; Mazor and Langstraat, 1992] and Verilog [Thomas and
Moorby,  1991]  are  increasingly  used  to  provide  a  detailed  speciﬁcation  of  the  function  in  a  manner
which is largely independent of the physical design of the function. VHDL and Verilog are “hardware
description languages,” representing designs from a variety of viewpoints including behavioral descrip-
tions, structural descriptions, and logical descriptions. Figure 25.25(a) illustrates the speciﬁcation of the
overall function in terms of subfunctions (A(s), B(s), …, E(s)) as well as expansion of one subfunction
(C(s)) into still simpler functions (c1, c2, c3, …, c6).
