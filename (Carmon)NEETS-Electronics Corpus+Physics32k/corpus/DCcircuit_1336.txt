If we recall that the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a current-carrying wire was always perpen-
dicular to that wire, and that the ﬂux intensity of that magnetic ﬁeld varied with the amount
of current through it, we can see that a wire is capable of inducing a voltage along its own
length simply due to a change in current through it. This effect is called self-induction: a
changing magnetic ﬁeld produced by changes in current through a wire inducing voltage along
the length of that same wire. If the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux is enhanced by bending the wire into the
shape of a coil, and/or wrapping that coil around a material of high permeability, this effect of
