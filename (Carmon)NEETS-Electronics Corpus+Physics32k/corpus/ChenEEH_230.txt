A fundamental observation can be made that there exist dc
operating points of transistor circuits that are unstable: if
the circuit is biased at such an operating point and if the
circuit is augmented with any conÔ¨Åguration of positive-valued
shunt capacitors and/or series inductors,
the equilibrium
point of the resulting dynamic circuit will always be unstable
(Green and Willson, 1992, 1994). A simple example is the
common latch circuit that, for appropriate parameter values,
possesses three dc operating points: two stable and one un-
stable.
