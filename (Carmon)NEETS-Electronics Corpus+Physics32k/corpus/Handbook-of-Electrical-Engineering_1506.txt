The Estimation Problem
Given an observation sequence or a set of sequences, (multiple utterances) the estimation problem is to ﬁnd
the “right” model parameter values that specify a model most likely to produce the given sequence. In speech
recognition, this is called training. There is no known closed form analytic solution for the maximum likelihood
model parameters. Nevertheless we can choose l
, A, B) such that its likelihood, P(O|l ), is locally maximized
using an iterative procedure such as the Baum-Welch re-estimation method (a form of the EM [expectation-
maximization] method [4]. The method intoduces an auxiliary function Q(ˆl
