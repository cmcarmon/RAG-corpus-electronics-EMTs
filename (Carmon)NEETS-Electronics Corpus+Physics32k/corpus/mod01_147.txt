With the knowledge of magnetic fields and magnetic lines of force developed up to this point, it is
simple to understand the manner in which a material becomes magnetized when brought near a magnet.
As an iron nail is brought close to a bar magnet (fig. 1-16), some flux lines emanating from the north pole
of the magnet pass through the iron nail in completing their magnetic path. Since magnetic lines of force
travel inside a magnet from the south pole to the north pole, the nail will be magnetized in such a polarity
that its south pole will be adjacent to the north pole of the bar magnet. There is now an attraction between
the two magnets.
