There  is  a  general  consensus  that  electrically  induced  aging  involves  the  mechanisms  of  treeing,  partial
discharge, and dielectric heating. Dielectric heating failures are more characteristic of lossy insulations or when
highly conductive contaminants are involved. In the treeing mechanism, a distinction must be made between
electrical and water trees [Bartnikas and Eichhorn, 1983]. The former refers to growth, resembling a tree, that
occurs under dry conditions in the presence of an electric ﬁeld; its branches or channels are hollow. In contrast,
water trees require the presence of moisture, and their branches consist of ﬁne ﬁlamentary channels, joining
small cavities, all of which contain water; when placed in a dry environment, they eventually disappear. In a
translucent dielectric, water trees are invisible and are rendered visible only when stained with a die, whereas
electrical trees once formed remain readily discernible. Water trees are intrinsic to solid polymeric insulation,
while electrical trees may occur in both solid and impregnated insulating systems. The actual failure path, when
the breakdown current is limited to prevent destruction of evidence, invariably, even in liquids, consists of an
electrical treelike structure.
