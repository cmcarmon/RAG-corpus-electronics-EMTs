Instead of using a step boundary condition for the wall movement, the velocity of the wall can be prescribed as an arbitrary function of time, i.e.,



U
=
f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle U=f(t)}
. Then the solution is given by




u
(
y

t
)

{\displaystyle u(y,t)=\int _{0}^{t}{\frac {f(\tau )}{2{\sqrt {\pi \nu }}}}{\frac {y}{(t-\tau )^{3/2}}}e^{-{\frac {y^{2}}{4\nu (t-\tau )}}}d\tau .}
