Because S2 is closed at the same time S1 is open, the stored energy of the capacitor now has a path for
current to flow. At t0, discharge current (id) from the bottom plate of the capacitor through the resistor (R) to
the top plate of the capacitor (C) is maximum. As time progresses toward t1, the discharge current steadily
decreases until at time t1 it reaches zero, as shown in graph (B).
