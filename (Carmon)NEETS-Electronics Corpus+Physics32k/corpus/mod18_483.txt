The sensitivity of the receiver is equal to the sum of the reading on the signal generator and the 
attenuations of the connecting cable and directional coupler. Receiver sensitivity is expressed as a 
negative dBm; for example, -90 dBm expresses the sensitivity of a receiver that can detect a signal 90 dB 
less than the 1-milliwatt reference level. A typical receiver sensitivity reading on a modern radar should 
be in the vicinity of -105 dBm.
