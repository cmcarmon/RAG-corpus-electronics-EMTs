Ideally, you will want to operate a transmitter at 100-percent modulation so that you can provide the 
maximum amount of energy in the sideband. However, because of the large and rapid fluctuations in 
amplitude that these signals normally contain, this ideal condition is seldom possible. When the 
modulator is properly adjusted, the loudest parts of the transmission will produce 100-percent modulation. 
The quieter parts of the signal then produce lesser degrees of modulation.
