static	electricity is created when two substances are 
rubbed together or separated. The substances can be 
solid or fluid. The rubbing or separating causes the 
transfer of electrons from one substance to the other. 
This results in one substance being positively charged 
and the other substance being negatively charged. 
When either substance comes in contact with a con-
ductor, an electrical current flows until it is at the same 
electrical potential as ground. This is referred to as 
electrostatic	discharge	(esD).
