With the potentiometer shaft positioned somewhere in the middle of its 
range, remove the 470 Ω resistor and connect the LED directly to the poten­
tiometer, as shown in Figure 5­14, right. Now rotate the shaft slowly in the 
direction that makes the light grow brighter. Rotate it all the way to the end 
and observe what happens to the LED. As you dial the pot down to 0 Ω, you 
should see the LED get brighter and brighter until finally it stops shining 
completely. With no resistance to limit current, the LED could burn out. (If it 
does, you should throw it away because it won’t work anymore.)
