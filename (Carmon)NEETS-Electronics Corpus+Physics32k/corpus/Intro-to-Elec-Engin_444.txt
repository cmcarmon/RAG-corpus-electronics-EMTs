which is independent of the op amp’s gain Ao (see Example 5.2.1). The sign inversion associated
with Equation (5.4.7) makes the ampliﬁer “inverting.” Generally if Ao is at least 200 times the
magnitude of R2/R1, then the actual gain given by Equation (5.4.6) will be within 1% of the ideal
gain given by Equation (5.4.7). Assuming inﬁnite gain of the op amp, it follows that
