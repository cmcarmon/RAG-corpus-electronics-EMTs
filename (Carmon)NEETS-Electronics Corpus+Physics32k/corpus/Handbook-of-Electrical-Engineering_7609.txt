that the output for the next state is reset. For S R = 10, Q = 1, indicating that the output for the next state is
set. In most cases the input conditions S R = 11 are not allowed for two reasons. If S R = 11, then the alternate
output  for  the  bistable,  shown  in  parentheses  as 
  in  Fig. 79.16,  is  not  logically  correct  as  it  is  for  all  other
input combinations. The second reason is more subtle since the next state of the bistable can be set or reset
due to a critical race condition when the inputs are changed from 11 to 00. Such unpredictability is not desirable
Q
and therefore the S R = 11 condition is generally not allowed. Latches and ﬂip-ﬂops that contain a Q and a 
output (complementary outputs) provide double-rail outputs.
