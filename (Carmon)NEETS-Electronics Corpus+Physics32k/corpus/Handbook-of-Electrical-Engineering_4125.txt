IEC 1000-4 Section 3. The IEC 1000-4-3 document involves the suscep-
tibility requirements for equipment under test (EUT). The primary concern
is the degradation of EUT under the inï¬‚uence of the hand-held transceiver
or  other  sources  of  radiation  in  the  frequency  range  80  to  1000  MHz.
Table 40.13 gives the tabulated limits of the susceptibility requirements.
