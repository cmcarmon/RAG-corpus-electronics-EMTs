2. Capacitor motors: Capacitor motors have a capacitor in series with the auxiliary winding
and come in three varieties: capacitor start, two-value capacitor, and permanent-split capacitor.
As their names imply, the ﬁrst two use a centrifugal switch or relay to open the circuit or reduce
the size of the starting capacitor when the motor comes up to speed. A two-value-capacitor motor,
with one value for starting and one for running, can be designed for optimum starting and running
performance; the starting capacitor is disconnected after the motor starts. The relevant schematic
diagrams and torque–speed characteristics are shown in Figures 13.2.13, 13.2.14, and 13.2.15.
Motors in which the auxiliary winding and the capacitor are not cut out during the normal running
conditions operate, in effect, as unbalanced two-phase induction motors.
