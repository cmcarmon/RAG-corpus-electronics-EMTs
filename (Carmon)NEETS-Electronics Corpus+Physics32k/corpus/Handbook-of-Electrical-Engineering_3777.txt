Effect of Atmospheric Hydrometeors
The  effect  of  atmospheric  hydrometeors  on  satellite–earth  propagation  is  of  major  concern  at  microwave
frequencies. The problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by atmospheric hydrometeors has attracted
much interest since the late 1940s. The main hydrometeors that exist for long duration and have the greatest
interaction with microwaves are rain and snow. At frequencies above 10 GHz, rain has been recognized as the
most fundamental obstacle on the earth–space path. Rain has been known to cause attenuation, phase difference,
and depolarization of radio waves. For analog signals, the effect of rain is more signiﬁcant above 10 GHz, while
for  digital  signals,  rain  effects  can  be  signiﬁcant  down  to  3  GHz.  Attenuation  of  microwaves  because  of
precipitation  becomes  severe  owing  to  increased  scattering  and  beam  energy  absorption  by  raindrops,  thus
impairing terrestrial as well as earth–satellite communication links. Cross-polarization distortion due to rain
has  also  engaged  the  attention  of  researchers.  This  is  of  particular  interest  when  frequency  reuse  employing
signals with orthogonal polarizations is used for doubling the capacity of a communication system. A thorough
review on the interaction of microwaves with hydrometeors has been given by Oguchi [1983].
