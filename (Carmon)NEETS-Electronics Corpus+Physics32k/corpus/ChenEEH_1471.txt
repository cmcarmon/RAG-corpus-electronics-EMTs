When the operating system gets control after the TRAP, it
examines the parameters to see if they are valid, and if so,
performs the work requested. When it is Ô¨Ånished, the operat-
ing system puts a status code in a register, telling whether it
succeeded or failed, and executes a return from trap instruc-
tion to return control back to the library procedure. The
library procedure then returns to the caller in the usual way,
returning the status code as a function value. Sometimes ad-
ditional values are returned in the parameters.
