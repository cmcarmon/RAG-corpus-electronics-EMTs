There are three basic kinds of wavemeters: the absorption, the reaction, and the transmission types. 
Absorption wavemeters are composed of the basic resonant circuit, a rectifier, and a meter for indicating 
the amount of current induced into the wavemeter. In use, this type of wavemeter is loosely coupled to the 
circuit to be measured. The resonant circuit of the wavemeter is then adjusted until the current meter 
shows a maximum deflection. The frequency of the circuit under test is then determined from the 
calibrated dial of the wavemeter.
