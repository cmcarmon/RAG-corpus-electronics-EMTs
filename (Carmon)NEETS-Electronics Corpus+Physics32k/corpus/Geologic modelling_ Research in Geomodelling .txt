Problems pertainting to Geomodelling cover:
Defining an appropriate Ontology to describe geological objects at various scales of interest,
Integrating diverse types of observations into 3D geomodels: geological mapping data, borehole data and interpretations, seismic images and interpretations, potential field data, well test data, etc.,
Better accounting for geological processes during model building,
Characterizing uncertainty about the geomodels to help assess risk. Therefore, Geomodelling has a close connection to Geostatistics and Inverse problem theory,
Applying of the recent developed Multiple Point Geostatistical Simulations (MPS) for integrating different data sources,
Automated geometry optimization and topology conservation
