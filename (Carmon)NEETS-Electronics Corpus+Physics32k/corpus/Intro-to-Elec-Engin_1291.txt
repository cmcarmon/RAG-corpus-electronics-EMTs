used, the demodulator may process the received waveform and decide on whether the transmitted
bit is a 0 or 1. The source decoder accepts the output sequence from the channel decoder, and
from the knowledge of the source encoding method used, attempts to reconstruct the original
signal from the source. Errors due to noise, interference, and practical system imperfections
do occur. The digital-to-analog (D/A) converter reconstructs an analog message that is a close
approximation to the original message. The difference, or some function of the difference, between
the original signal and the reconstructed signal is a measure of the distortion introduced by the
digital communication system.
