And the answer is: 0.36 x 104, or 3.6 x 103, seconds. You can see that we arrived at the
same quantity of time (3600 seconds). Now, you may be wondering what the point of all this
is when we have electronic calculators that can handle the math automatically. Well, back
in the days of scientists and engineers using ”slide rule” analog computers, these techniques
were indispensable. The ”hard” arithmetic (dealing with the signiﬁcant digit ﬁgures) would be
performed with the slide rule while the powers-of-ten could be ﬁgured without any help at all,
being nothing more than simple addition and subtraction.
