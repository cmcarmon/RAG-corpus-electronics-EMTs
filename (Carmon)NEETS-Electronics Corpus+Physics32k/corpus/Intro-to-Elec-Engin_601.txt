Twisted pairs are used in low-performance and low-cost applications with a data rate of about
1 Mbit per second (Mbps) for a transmission distance of about 1 km. Baseband coaxial cables
used for digital transmission are usually 50- cables with a data rate of about 10 Mbps over a
distance of about 2 km. Broad-band coaxial cables used for analog transmission (cable TV) are
usually 75- cables with a data rate of about 500 Mbps over a distance of about 10 km. The
lighter and cheaper Ô¨Åber-optic cables support data transmission of about 1 Gbps over a distance
of about 100 km.
