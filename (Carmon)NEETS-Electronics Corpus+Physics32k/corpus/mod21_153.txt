Klystron tubes that remain inoperative for more than 6 months may become gassy. This condition
occurs in klystrons installed in stored or spare equipment as well as in klystrons stored as stock supplies.
Operation of a gassy klystron at its rated voltages will ionize the gas molecules and may cause excessive
beam current to flow. This excessive beam current may shorten the life of the klystron or produce
immediate failure. You can detect gas in a klystron tube by setting the applied reflector voltage to zero
and slowly increasing the beam voltage while observing a meter that indicates the beam current -
excessive beam current for a specific value of voltage indicates that the tube is gassy.
