Forward genetics has been used to create Neurospora clock mutants with varied periods of conidiation. Although nine alleles have been described as having come from forward genetics, sequence analysis subsequent to the cloning of frq showed that frq[2] ,frq[4], and frq[6] shared the same single base change, and likewise frq[7] and frq[8] had the same single base change, so the redundant alleles have been dropped. The periods of various frq mutants that arose from forward screens are as follows when measured at 25oC, although it should be noted that because frq[3] and frq[7] result in clocks with altered temperature compensation, periods will be different at other temperatures:
