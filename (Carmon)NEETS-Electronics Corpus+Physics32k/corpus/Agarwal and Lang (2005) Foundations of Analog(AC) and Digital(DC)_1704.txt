The charge pump operates cyclically as shown in Figure 12.12. To begin a cycle, switch
S1 closes for the duration T causing the current in the inductor to ramp up. During this
time switch S2 remains open, and so the capacitor charge and voltage remain constant.
Next, switch S1 opens and switch S2 closes. This switch action disconnects the source
from the inductor, and since the inductor current does not change instantaneously, it
redirects the inductor current into the capacitor. The inductor current now rings down
as the capacitor voltage rings up. Finally, switch S2 opens when the inductor current
first goes to zero, and both switches remain open until the start of the next cycle.
