Since inductors have to be avoided, circuits that use only
capacitors, resistors, and gain were developed whose input
impedance looks inductive. The concept is shown in Figure
4.7(B) where the box labeled GIC is used to convert the resistor
RL to the inductive impedance ZL. The general impedance
converter (GIC) generates an input impedance as ZL ¼ sTRL,
where T is a time constant. For the inductor L in the RLC
circuit, we then can substitute a GIC loaded by a resistor
RL ¼ L=T .
