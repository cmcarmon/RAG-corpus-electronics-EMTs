A local network distinguishes itself as short distance; there-
fore, the smaller propagation delay would provide instant
feedback about the state of a transmission. The frame size
could determine the transmission time and also plays an im-
portant role in the designing network and affects the perform-
ance of a local network. The parameter a is obtained by
dividing the propagation time by the transmission time and
is the most important single parameter that affects the per-
formance of the local network. The smaller a is, the better
performance the network has. If transmission time is normal-
ized to 1, a should indicate the propagation delay of a network.
The parameter a can also be used as a good indication of
effects on utilization and throughput. In general, the utiliza-
tion varies inversely with a (U ¼ 1/(1 þ a)) regardless of which
MAC protocol is used. Throughput is affected by the param-
eter a regardless of the offered load (G). The larger the a is, the
lower throughput the network has.
