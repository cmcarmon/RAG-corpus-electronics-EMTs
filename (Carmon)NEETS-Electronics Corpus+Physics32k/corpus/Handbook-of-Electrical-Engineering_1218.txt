imply that y Ë›  P(x). The point-to-set projection mapping  P is said to be closed on the set X1 if it is closed at
each point in X1.
Signal Restoration Algorithm
We are now in a position to describe the signal restoration algorithm for the case of general attribute sets. This
shall be formally done in the format of the following theorem [Cadzow, 1988].
