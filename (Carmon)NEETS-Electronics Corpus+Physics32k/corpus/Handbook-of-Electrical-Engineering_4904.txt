The fundamental idea behind all of a superconductor’s unique properties is that
 is a quantum
mechanical phenomenon on a macroscopic scale created when the motions of individual electrons are corre-
lated. According to the theory developed by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer (BCS theory),
this correlation takes place when two electrons couple to form a Cooper pair. For our purposes, we may therefore
consider the electrical charge carriers in a superconductor to be Cooper pairs (or more colloquially, superelec-
* twice those of normal electrons. The average distance between the two

of Cooper pairs as tightly bound electron molecules. Instead, there are many other electrons between those of
