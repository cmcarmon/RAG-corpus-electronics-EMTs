Semiconductor temperature sensors 
 
Semiconductor  temperature  sensors  are  ideal  for  a 
wide  range  of  temperature-sensing  applications. 
The  popular  AD590  semiconductor  temperature 
sensor,  for  example,  produces  an  output  current 
which  is  proportional  to  absolute  temperature  and 
which  increases  at  the  rate  of  1  JA/K.  The 
characteristic  of  the  device  is  illustrated  in  Fig. 
16.19.  The  AD590  is  laser  trimmed  to  produce  a 
current of 298.2 JA (±2.5 JA) at a temperature of 
298.2°C (i.e. 25°C). A typical interface between the 
AD590  and  an  analogue 
in  
Fig.  16.20.  The  Practical  investigation  (page  301) 
makes further use of this device.
