The current in a resistive circuit depends on the  applied 
voltage. The current is always in phase with the voltage 
regardless of the number of resistors in the circuit. At 
any point in the circuit, the current has the same value.
Figure 23-3 shows a simple series	ac	circuit. 
The current flow is the same through both resistors. 
Using Ohmâ€™s law, the voltage drop across each resistor 
can be determined. The voltage drops added together 
equal the applied voltage. Figure 23-4 shows the phase 
 relationships of the voltage drops, the applied  voltage, 
and the current in the circuit. All the voltages and 
the current are in phase with one another in a pure 
 resistive circuit.
