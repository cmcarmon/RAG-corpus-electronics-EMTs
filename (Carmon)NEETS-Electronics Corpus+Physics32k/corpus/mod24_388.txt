V-grooved splices may involve sandwiching the butted ends of two prepared fibers between a
V-grooved substrate and a flat glass plate. Additional V-grooved devices use two or three positioning rods
to form a suitable V-groove for splicing. The V-grooved device that uses two positioning rods is the
spring V-grooved splice. This splice uses a groove formed by two rods positioned in a bracket to align the
fiber ends. The diameter of the positioning rods permits the outer surface of each fiber end to extend
above the groove formed by the rods. A flat spring presses the fiber ends into the groove maintaining
fiber alignment. Transparent adhesive completes the assembly process by bonding the fiber ends and
providing index matching. Figure 4-11 is an illustration of the spring V-grooved splice. A variation of this
splice uses a third positioning rod instead of a flat spring. The rods are held in place by a heat-shrinkable
band, or tube.
