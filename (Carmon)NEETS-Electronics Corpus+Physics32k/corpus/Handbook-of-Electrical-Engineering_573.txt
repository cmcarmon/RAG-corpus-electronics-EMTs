Power-Series Method
In this method a truncated power-series expansion of the dc transfer characteristics of a nonlinear circuit is
used. Therefore, the method is suitable only when energy storage effects in the nonlinear circuit are negligible
and  the  input  signal  is  small.  In  general,  the  input  and  output  signals  comprise  both  dc  and  time-varying
components. For distortion calculation we are interested in the time-varying or incremental components around
a quiescent1 operating point. For the transfer characteristic of Fig. 5.19, denote the quiescent operating condi-
â€“
tions by X0 and
Y0 and the incremental variables by x(t) and y(t), at the input and output, respectively. The
output can be expressed as a function of the input using a series expansion
