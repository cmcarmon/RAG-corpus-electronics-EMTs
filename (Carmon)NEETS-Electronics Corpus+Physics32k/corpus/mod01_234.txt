of resistance. If the cross-sectional area of a conductor is increased, a greater quantity of electrons are
available for movement through the conductor. Therefore, a larger current will flow for a given amount of
applied voltage. An increase in current indicates that when the cross-sectional area of a conductor is
increased, the resistance must have decreased. If the cross-sectional area of a conductor is decreased, the
number of available electrons decreases and, for a given applied voltage, the current through the
conductor decreases. A decrease in current flow indicates that when the cross-sectional area of a
conductor is decreased, the resistance must have increased. Thus, the RESISTANCE OF A
CONDUCTOR IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA.
