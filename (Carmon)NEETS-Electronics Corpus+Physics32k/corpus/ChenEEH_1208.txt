The function of interconnects or a wiring system is to distrib-
ute clock and other signals and to provide power/ground to and
among the various circuits/systems functions on a chip. Current
leading-edge logic processors have seven to eight levels of high-
density interconnect, and current leading-edge memory has
three levels (Sematech, 1999). There are three types of wiring
to distribute the clock and signal functions (local, intermediate,
and global). Local wiring, consisting of very thin lines, connects
gates and transistors in an execution unit or a functional block
(such as embedded logic, cache memory, or address adder) on
the chip. Local wires usually span a few gates and occupy Ô¨Årst
and sometimes second metal layers. Intermediate wiring pro-
vides clock and signal distribution in a functional blocks with
typical lengths up to 3 to 4 mm. Intermediate wires are wider
and taller than local wires to provide lower resistance signal/
clock paths. Global wiring provides clock and signal distribution
between the functional blocks and delivers power/ground to all
functions on a chip. Figure 8.3 shows the delay of local and
global wiring in future generations. Repeaters can be incorpor-
ated to mitigate the delay in global wiring but consume power
and chip area (Sematech, 1999).
