Routings may avoid the shorter ground distance of a great circle route to use tailwinds to save time and fuel, shortening the equivalent still air distance. Air India's flights from Delhi to San Francisco can be routed over the Pacific Ocean rather than the North Pole over 15,000 km (8,099 nmi; 9,321 mi) rather than 12,395 km (6,693 nmi; 7,702 mi), similar to the 17 hours QR 921's distance, but taking 14.5 hours due to tailwinds.
Cathay Pacific flights from Hong Kong to New York City-JFK can fly 15,000 km (8,099 nmi; 9,321 mi) ground routes, rather than the 12,984 km (7,011 nmi; 8,068 mi) great circle route.
