In the above equations, xd and xud are the doped and undoped
AlGaAs thicknesses, and d is the thickness of the 2-D elec-
tron gas that is typically less than 100 A. The threshold voltage
can be made positive or negative by adjusting xd . Hence, both
enhancement and depletion mode devices are possible. The
transconductance in the linear region is given by:
