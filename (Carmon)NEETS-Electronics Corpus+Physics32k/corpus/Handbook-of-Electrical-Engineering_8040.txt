Data Collection
In data collection the microprocessor-based system serves primarily as a low-cost data recorder. Basic functions
include the polling of sensors, acceptance of data, data storage, and data transmission or display. Additional
features might include preprocessing of the raw data. Such a classiÔ¨Åcation spans a broad range of applications,
from automotive diagnostics to space-born monitoring stations.
