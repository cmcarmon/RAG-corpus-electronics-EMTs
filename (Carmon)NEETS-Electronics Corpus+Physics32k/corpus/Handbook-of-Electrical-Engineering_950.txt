where we have used the term mmin in the denominator to represent some minimum value of the measured data.
The absolute RMS error is usually used when the measured values approach zero to avoid problems with small
or zero denominators in (13.1). For everything that follows, we consider only the relative RMS error. The best
result  is  obtained  by  combining  the  relative  RMS  formula  with  the  absolute  RMS  formula  by  taking  the
maximum of the denominator from (13.1) or (13.2).
