induced e.m.f. is such that it opposes the  original 
potential and will cause current to continue to flow 
in  the  load  (i.e.  clockwise  around  the  circuit).  In 
this condition, the switching diode, D, will become 
forward  biased,  completing  the  circuit  in  order  to 
provide a return path for the current.    
  Waveforms for the circuit of Fig. 6.27 are shown 
in Fig. 6.28. The inductor voltage, VL, is alternately 
positive  and  negative.  When  S1  is  closed,  the 
voltage  dropped  across  the  inductor  (from  left  to 
right in the diagram) will be equal to +(Vin B Vout). 
When  S1  is  open,  the  voltage  across  the  inductor
