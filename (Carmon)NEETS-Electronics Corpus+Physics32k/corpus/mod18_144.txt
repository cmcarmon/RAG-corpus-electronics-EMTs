The separation of the background and the radar contact is based on the Doppler frequency that is
caused by the reflection of the signal from a moving object. Disadvantages of the Doppler system are that
it does not determine the range of the object, nor is it able to differentiate between objects when they lie
in the same direction and are traveling at the same speed. Moreover, it does not "see" stationary or slow-
moving objects, which a pulse radar system can detect.
