notion of breaking it. Speciﬁcally, the attacker is allowed to obtain signatures to any message of his choice. One
may argue that in many applications, such a general attack is not possible (as messages to be signed must have
a speciﬁc format). Yet, our view is that it is impossible to deﬁne a general (i.e., application-independent) notion
of admissible messages, and thus a general/robust deﬁnition of an attack seems to have to be formulated, as
suggested  here.  (Note  that,  at  worst,  our  approach  is  overly  cautious.)  Likewise,  the  adversary  is  said  to  be
successful if he can produce a valid signature to any message for which he has not asked for a signature during
his attack. Again, this refers to the ability to form signatures to possibly “nonsensical” messages as a breaking
of the scheme. Yet, again, we see no way to have a general (i.e., application-independent) notion of “meaningful”
messages (so that only forging signatures to them will be consider a breaking of the scheme).
