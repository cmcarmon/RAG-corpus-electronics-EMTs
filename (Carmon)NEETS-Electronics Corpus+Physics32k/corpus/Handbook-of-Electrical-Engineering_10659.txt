Signal  conditioning  consists  of  ampliﬁcation,  ﬁltering,  limiting,  and  other  operations  that  prepare  the  raw
instrument input signal for further operations. The signal may be the output of a transducer or it may be an
electrical signal obtained directly from an electronic device or circuit. Signal processing applies some algorithm
to the basic signal in order to obtain meaningful information. Signal conditioning and processing operations
 circuit techniques, or using a combination of methods. There are a
may be performed using 
variety of trade-offs between them. For example, analog methods offer bandwidth advantages, whereas digital
techniques  offer  advanced  algorithm  support  and  long-term  stability.  The  use  of  microprocessors  within  an
instrument makes it possible to perform many useful functions including calibration, linearization, conversion,
storage,  display,  and  transmission.  A  block  diagram  of  a  representative  microprocessor-based  instrument  is
shown in Fig. 108.2.
