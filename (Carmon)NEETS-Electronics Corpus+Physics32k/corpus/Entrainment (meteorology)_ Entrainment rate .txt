Cumulus clouds have a significant impact on transport of energy and water vapor, and then influence precipitation and climate. In large scale models, cumulus clouds need to be parameterized. Entrainment rate is a key parameter in cumulus parameterization. Henry Stommel was the first to study entrainment rate in cumulus clouds.
