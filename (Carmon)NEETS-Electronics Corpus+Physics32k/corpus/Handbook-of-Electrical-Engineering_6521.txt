wavelength directly modulated semiconductor laser are shown in Fig. 71.5 [Darcie et al., 1986]. Both distortions 
are  small  at  low  frequencies  but  rise  to maxima  at  half  the  relaxation  resonance  frequency. AM-VSB  systems 
are feasible only within the low-frequency window. FM or uncompressed digital systems require enough band-
width per channel that multichannel systems must operate in the region of large RD. Fortunately, the CNR require-
ments allow for the increased distortion. The large second-order RD can be avoided entirely by operating within a 
one-octave frequency band (e.g., 2â€“4 GHz), such that all second-order products are out of band.
