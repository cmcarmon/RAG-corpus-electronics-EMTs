Practical  applications  of  RLC circuits  are  found  in  control  and  com-
munications circuits such as ringing circuits, peaking circuits, resonant
circuits,  smoothing  circuits,  and  Ô¨Ålters.  Most  of  these  circuits  cannot
be covered until we treat ac sources. For now, we will limit ourselves
to two simple applications: automobile ignition and smoothing circuits.
