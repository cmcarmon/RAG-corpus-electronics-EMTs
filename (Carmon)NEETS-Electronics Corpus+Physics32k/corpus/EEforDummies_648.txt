To determine these characteristics, consult the component’s data sheet, 
which provides technical specifications for the component, on the manufac-
turer’s website. If you’re building a circuit someone else designed, you don’t 
have to worry too much about the specs; you can simply use the transistor 
specified by the designer or consult a cross‐reference to find a similar model 
to substitute.
