The increased demands for mobility and ﬂexibility in daily life
are demands that lead the development from wired LANs to
wireless LANs (WLANs). Today a WLAN can offer users high
bit rates to meet the requirements of bandwidth consuming
services, such as video conferences and streaming videos. With
this in mind, a user of a WLAN will have high demands on the
system and will not accept too much degradation in perform-
ance to achieve mobility and ﬂexibility. This will in turn put
high demands on the design of WLANs of the future. In this
section we ﬁrst discuss the WLAN architecture, deployment
and security issues. Finally, future trends in wireless technology
are also discussed.
