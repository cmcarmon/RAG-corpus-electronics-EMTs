This permanent-magnet moving-coil meter movement is the basic movement in most measuring
instruments. It is commonly called the d’Arsonval movement because it was first employed by the
Frenchman d’Arsonval in making electrical measurements. Figure 1-10 is a view of the d’Arsonval meter
movement used in a meter.
