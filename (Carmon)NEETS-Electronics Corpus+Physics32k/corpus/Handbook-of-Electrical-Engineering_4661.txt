Given the form of the time response, energy arguments are used to determine the device equivalent circuit
parameters. Assume a delta function voltage input, vin(t) = d(t), then Vin(w) = 1. Given h(t), H(w) is known
and the energy launched as a function of frequency is given by E(w) = 2Â·*H(w)*2. Then
