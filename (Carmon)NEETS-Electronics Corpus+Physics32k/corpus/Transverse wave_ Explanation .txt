Transverse waves are waves that are oscillating perpendicularly(at a right angle)to the direction of propagation. If you anchor one end of a ribbon or string and hold the other end in your hand, you can create transverse waves by moving your hand up and down. Notice though, that you can also launch waves by moving your hand side-to-side. This is an important point. There are two independent directions in which wave motion can occur. In this case, these motions are the Y and X directions mentioned above, while the wave propagates away in the z direction. The other type of waves is the longitudinal wave, which oscillates in the direction of its propagation.
