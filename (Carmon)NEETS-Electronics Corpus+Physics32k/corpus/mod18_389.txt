Gated agc does not respond to signals that arrive at times other than during the time of a target return
signal. However, it cannot prevent interference that occurs during the gating period. Neither can gating
the agc prevent the receiver from overloading because of jamming signal amplitudes far in excess of the
target return signal. This is because the desired target is gated to set the receiver gain for a signal of that
particular amplitude. As an aid in preventing radar receiver circuits from overloading during the reception
of jamming signals, fast-time-constant coupling circuits are used. These circuits connect the video
detector output to the video amplifier input circuit.
