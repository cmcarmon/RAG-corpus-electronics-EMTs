Similarly, if the medium was initially saturated to –Ms, then magnetized by a ﬁeld +H1, and ﬁnally allowed to
go to a remanent state, the magnetization would go to value M1. This hysteretic behavior is the basis for the
use of the medium for long-term storage of information but makes the recording process highly nonlinear.
