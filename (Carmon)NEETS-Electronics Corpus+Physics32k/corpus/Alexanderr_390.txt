1. The analysis in this chapter is applicable to any circuit that can be
reduced to an equivalent circuit comprising a resistor and a single
energy-storage  element  (inductor  or  capacitor).  Such  a  circuit  is
ﬁrst-order because its behavior is described by a ﬁrst-order differ-
ential  equation.  When  analyzing  RC and  RL circuits,  one  must
always keep in mind that the capacitor is an open circuit to steady-
state dc conditions while the inductor is a short circuit to steady-
state dc conditions.
