The electrical lock method, although not as accurate as the voltmeter method, is perhaps tile fastest 
method of zeroing synchros. However, this method can be used only if the rotors of the units to be zeroed 
are free to turn and the lead connections are accessible. For this reason, this method is usually used on the 
TR because, unlike transmitters, the TR shaft is free to turn.
