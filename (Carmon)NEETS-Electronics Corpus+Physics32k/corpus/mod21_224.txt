The JFET has a voltage-responsive characteristic with a high input impedance. Two types of JFETs that
you should become familiar with are the junction p-channel and the junction n-channel types, as shown in
figure 2-16. Their equivalent circuits are shown in figures 2-17 and 2-18, respectively. The only
difference in your testing of these two types of JFETs involves the polarity of the meter leads.
