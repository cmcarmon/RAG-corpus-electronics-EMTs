Electric power is primarily transmitted as a three-phase
signal. Three ac current currents are sent that are out of
phase by 1208 but of equal magnitude. Such balanced currents
sum to zero and, thus, obviate the need for a return line. If the
voltages are balanced as well, then the total power transmitted
will be constant in time, which is a more efÔ¨Åcient use of
equipment capacity. For large scale systems analysis, the as-
sumption is usually made that the system is balanced. Each
phase can be then analyzed independently, greatly simplifying
computations. In the following paragraphs, the implicit as-
sumption is that three-phase systems are being used.
