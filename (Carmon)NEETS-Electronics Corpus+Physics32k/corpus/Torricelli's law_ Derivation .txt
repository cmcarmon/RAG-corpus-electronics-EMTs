Under the assumptions of an incompressible fluid with negligible viscosity, Bernoulli's principle states that:







v

=

constant



{\displaystyle {v^{2} \over 2}+gh+{p \over \rho }={\text{constant}}}

where v is fluid speed, g is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s2), h is the fluid's height above a reference point, p is pressure, and ρ is density. Define the opening to be at h=0. At the top of the tank, p is equal to the atmospheric pressure. v can be considered 0 because the fluid surface drops in height extremely slowly compared to the speed at which fluid exits the tank. At the opening, h=0 and p is again atmospheric pressure. Eliminating the constant and solving gives:
