In May 2016, the city attempted to solve the problem by installing a traffic signal at the intersection, removing the yellow warning lights in return. When an over-height truck approaches, the light turns yellow, then red, and a screen displays the message "OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN". The light will eventually turn green again, even if a truck driver chooses not to turn. The city hoped the long delay would give drivers time to realize their trucks will not fit under the bridge. However, another truck hit the bridge on July 6, 2016.
