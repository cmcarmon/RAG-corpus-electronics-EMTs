These measurements, however, show only that a JFET operates in a manner similar to a bipolar 
transistor, even though the two are constructed differently. As stated before, the main advantage of an 
FET is that its input impedance is significantly higher than that of a bipolar transistor. The higher input 
impedance of the JFET under reverse gate bias conditions can be seen by connecting a microammeter in 
series with the gate-source voltage (V GG), as shown in figure 3-49.
