The Blasius–Chaplygin formula, devised by Sergey Chaplygin from the work of Heinrich Blasius relates the force

{\displaystyle {\bar {L}}={\frac {I\rho }{2}}\int _{\gamma }f^{2}(z)\,\mathrm {d} z}

The equation stated above appears from the analysis of the velocity over a body with a boundary

{\displaystyle \gamma }
, taking Bernoulli's law into consideration.
