The portion of time over which the transmitter is in operation is referred to as the radar duty cycle. The
average transmitter power is the product of duty cycle and peak transmitter power. Duty cycle ranges from less
pulse radars to somewhat less than 50% for high pulse repetition frequency
than 1% for typical 
(PRF)  pulse  Doppler  radar  systems.  High  PRF  systems  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  interrupted  continuous
wave  (ICW)  systems  because  they  operate  essentially  as  a  CW  radar  system  with  transmitter  and  receiver
alternately turned on and off.
