In working with digital equipment, it is often nec-
essary to convert from binary to decimal form and 
vice versa. The most popular way to convert decimal 
numbers to binary numbers is to progressively divide 
the decimal number by 2, writing down the remainder 
after each division. The remainders, taken in reverse 
order, form the binary number.
EXAMPLE:â€‚ To convert 1110 to a binary number, 
 progressively divide by 2 (LSB 5 least significant bit).
