The transmission wavemeter is an adjustable coupling link. When it is inserted between a source of 
rf energy and an indicator, energy is transmitted to the indicator only when the wavemeter is tuned to the 
frequency of the source. Transmission wavemeters are widely used in measuring microwave frequencies.
