An analogue output voltage results from a change of resistance within a 
cadmium sulphide (CdS) sensing element. Usually connected as part of a 
potential divider or bridge. 
Two-terminal device connected as a current source. An analogue output 
voltage is developed across a series resistor of appropriate value.
