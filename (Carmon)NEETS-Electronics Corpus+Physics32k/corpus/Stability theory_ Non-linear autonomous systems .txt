Asymptotic stability of fixed points of a non-linear system can often be established using the Hartman–Grobman theorem.
Suppose that v is a C1-vector field in Rn which vanishes at a point p, v(p) = 0. Then the corresponding autonomous system





x
′

=
v
(
x
)


{\displaystyle x'=v(x)}

has a constant solution




x
(
t
)
=
p
.


{\displaystyle x(t)=p.}

Let Jp(v) be the n×n Jacobian matrix of the vector field v at the point p. If all eigenvalues of J have strictly negative real part then the solution is asymptotically stable. This condition can be tested using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion.
