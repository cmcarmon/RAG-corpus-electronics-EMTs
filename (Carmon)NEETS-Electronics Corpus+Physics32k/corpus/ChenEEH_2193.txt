mation used to solve for magnetic ﬁelds and magnetic ﬂuxes
(Cheng, 1989; Paul et al., 1998; Planus, 1978). Applications for
this method include the design of electrical generators, motors,
transformers, and actuators. Magnetic circuit analysis is quite
similar to electrical circuit analysis. Quantities that serve
analogous purposes in both types of circuit analyses are listed
side by side in Table 1.7.
