Flux: Also  called  radiant  ﬂux,  the  radiant  power  emitted  by  a  source.  It  can  be  expressed  in  watts  for  a
radiometric source or in lumens when the source spectral energy distribution is between 400 and 700 nm.
Illumination: The effect of a visible radiation ﬂux received on a given surface. Illumination is measured by
the illuminance, which is the luminous ﬂux received by surface unit, usually expressed in lux. One lux
equals 1 lumen/m2.
