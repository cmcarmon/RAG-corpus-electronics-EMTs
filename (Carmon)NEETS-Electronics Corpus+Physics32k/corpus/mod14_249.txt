Letâ€™s go back to the statement "Today is payday." We stated that P represents the TRUE state. If we
apply P to the input of the inverter as shown in figure 2-10, then the output will be the opposite of the
input. The output, in this case, is P . At times T0 through T2, P is LOW. Consequently, the output ( P ) is
HIGH. At T2, P goes HIGH and as a result P  goes LOW. P  remains LOW as long as P is HIGH and vice
versa. The Boolean expression for the output of this gate is f = P .
