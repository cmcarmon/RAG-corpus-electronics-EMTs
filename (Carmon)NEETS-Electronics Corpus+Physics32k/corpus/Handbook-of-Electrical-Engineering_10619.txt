Once the contribution of illumination to the window surface has been calculated, two longhand methods
are available to determine the illumination contribution to the space. The ﬁrst method is to follow the point-
by-point procedure, which makes two assumptions: (1) interreﬂected component is ignored and (2) the window
is a uniform diffuse emitter. The second method is a lumen method that calculates illumination values at three
points deﬁned as the maximum, midway, and minimum. This method includes both the direct and interreﬂected
components of illumination.
