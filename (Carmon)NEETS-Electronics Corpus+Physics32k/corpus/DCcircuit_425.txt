In recent years a new style of metric notation for electric quantities has emerged which
seeks to avoid the use of the decimal point. Since decimal points (”.”) are easily misread and/or
”lost” due to poor print quality, quantities such as 4.7 k may be mistaken for 47 k. The new
notation replaces the decimal point with the metric preﬁx character, so that ”4.7 k” is printed
instead as ”4k7”. Our last ﬁgure from the prior example, ”0.267 m”, would be expressed in the
new notation as ”0m267”.
