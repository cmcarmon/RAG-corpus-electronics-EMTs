Measures of the Transient Response
In  general,  analysis  of  the  transient  response  of  a  dynamic  system  to  a  reference  input  is  difﬁcult.  Hence
formulating a standard measure of performance becomes complicated. In many cases, the response is dominated
by a pair of poles and thus acts like a second-order system.
