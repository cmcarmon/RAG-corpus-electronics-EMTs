In the figure, the sawtooth generator replaces the potentiometer and is connected to both horizontal
plates of the CRT. At the reference line, the potential on both plates is equal. Below the line, the left plate
is more positive and the right plate is less positive. This causes the beam to move left. Above the line, the
right plate is made more positive than the left and the beam moves to the right. The waveform amplitude
causes a uniform movement of the beam across the screen (called TRACE). RETRACE time, shown at
the trailing edge of the waveform, quickly deflects the beam back to the starting point.
