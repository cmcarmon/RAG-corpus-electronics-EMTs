The greatest advantage of digital images is that they can be processed on a computer. Any type of operation
that one can do on a computer can be done to a digital image. Recall that a digital image is just a (huge) matrix
of numbers. Digital image processing is the process of using a computer to extract useful information from
this matrix. Processing that cannot be done optically or with analog systems (such as early video systems) can
be easily done on computers. The disadvantage is that a large amount of data needs to be processed and on
some small computer systems this can take a long time (hours). We shall examine image processing in more
detail in the next subsection and discuss some of the computer hardware issues in a later chapter.
