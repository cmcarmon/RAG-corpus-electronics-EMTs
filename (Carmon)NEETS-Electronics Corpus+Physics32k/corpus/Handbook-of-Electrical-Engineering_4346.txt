AERES, a San Jose-based company, has developed a new approach to ground-penetrating radar using
impulse radar. The Ô¨Årst application of the technology was an airborne system for detecting underground
bunkers. The design can be altered to provide high depth capability for large targets, or high resolution
for  smaller  targets  near  the  surface.  This  supports  requirements  in  land  mine  searches  and  explosive
ordinance  disposal  for  the  military.  AERAS  has  developed  both  aircraft  and  ground-based  systems
designed for civilian applications as well as military. Underground utility mapping, such as locating pipes
and cables; highway and bridge under-surface inspection; and geological and archeological surveying are
examples of the possible civilian applications. (Reprinted with permission from NASA Tech Briefs, 20(10),
