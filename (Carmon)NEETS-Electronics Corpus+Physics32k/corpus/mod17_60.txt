As naval electronics has grown in capability and complexity, an orderly plan of equipment 
designations has been adopted. The largest designator, system, describes equipment that work together for 
a specific function. For example, the radar system of a ship includes every item of electronics equipment 
used in or with a radar on board that ship. The smallest designator, part, describes one single piece, such 
as a bolt or a resistor.
