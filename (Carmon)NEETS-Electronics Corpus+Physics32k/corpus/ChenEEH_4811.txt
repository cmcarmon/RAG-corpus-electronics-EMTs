Control systems and computers enjoy a very successful part-
nership that began modestly in the 1940s when the theoretical
framework for sampled data control systems was Ô¨Årst estab-
lished. The early implementation of the control was done with
minicomputers that were rather bulky and sensitive to envi-
ronmental conditions (e.g., heat, humidity, etc.) and, hence,
not well suited for many applications. The popularity of digital
control grew dramatically shortly after microprocessors were
introduced in the early 1970s. The main considerations of
these early digital controllers were speed of the processor, effect
of quantization, and effect of sampling rates. The software
considerations revolved around the size of the executable pro-
gram (in terms of memory requirements) and the speed at
which it executed (to increase the sampling rate). Many early
control system programs were written in assembly code be-
cause compiled C programs and Pascal programs were often
too large and too slow. As computer technology advanced, the
emphasis in digital control research was placed on analysis and
on the development of sophisticated algorithms.
