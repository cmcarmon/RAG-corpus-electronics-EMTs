Classiﬁcation of Printer Technologies
Table 89.7  illustrates  the  two  main  classiﬁcations  of  printer  technologies  and  also  the  wide  range  of  extant
technologies. Those technologies listed under line impact and page printing are used for large computer system
printing; by far the most popular are fully formed character and electrophotographic (so-called laser printers).
The  most  common  printing  technologies  used  for  personal/workstation  computer  systems  are electrophoto-
graphic, ink jet, and serial wire matrix. Emphasis in the following is directed to these favored technologies, with
brief descriptions of the others included.
