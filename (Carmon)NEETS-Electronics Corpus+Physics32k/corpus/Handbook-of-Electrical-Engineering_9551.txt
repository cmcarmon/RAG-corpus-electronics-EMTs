Multimedia
Yet another new generation database application is multimedia, where non-text forms of data, such as voice,
video,  and  image,  are  accessed  via  some  form  of  a  user  interface.  Hypermedia  interfaces  are  becoming  the
primary delivery system for the multimedia applications. These interfaces, such as Mosaic, allow users to browse
through an information base consisting of many different types of data. The basis of hypermedia is the hypertext,
where  some  text  based  information  is  accessed  in  a  non-sequential  manner.  Hypermedia  is  an  extension  of
hypertext paradigm into multimedia.
