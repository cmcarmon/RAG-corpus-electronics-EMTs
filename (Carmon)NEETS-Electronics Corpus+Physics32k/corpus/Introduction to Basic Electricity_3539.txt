A  Pin	 photodiode  has  an  intrinsic  layer 
 between  the  P  and  N  regions.  This  effectively 
 extends the depletion region. The wider depletion 
region  allows the PIN photodiode to respond to 
lower light frequencies, which have less energy and 
so must  penetrate deeper into the depletion region 
 before generating free electrons. The wider depletion 
 region offers a greater chance of free electrons  being 
 generated. The PIN photodiode is more  efficient 
over a wide range.
