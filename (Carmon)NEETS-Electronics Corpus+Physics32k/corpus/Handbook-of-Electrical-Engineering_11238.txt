Topographic maps are constructed from monopolar electrodes referenced to a common cephalic (linked ears
or  mandible,  chin  and  nose)  or  noncephalic  (linked  clavicles  or  a  balanced  sternum-vertebra)  electrode.
Although the reference electrode should be free of any EEG activity, in practice most cephalic electrodes contain
some EEG activity, while noncephalic electrodes are a potential source of EKG or muscle activity. Differential
ampliﬁcation of an EEG-contaminated reference electrode can decrease or cancel similar activity in neighboring
electrodes, while at electrodes distant from the reference, the injected activity will be present as a potential of
opposite polarity. Similarly, noncerebral potentials can be injected into scalp electrodes and misinterpreted as
cerebral  activity.  Therefore,  a  nonneutral  reference  electrode  can  result  in  misleading  map  conﬁgurations.
Several  techniques  have  been  applied  to  circumvent  this  problem.  The  construction  of  multiple  maps  using
several different references can sometimes assist in differentiating active and reference electrode activity. This
can be accomplished by acquiring serial EEG records using different references. Alternatively, various references
can be acquired simultaneously during acquisition, and various montages can be digitally reconstructed, post hoc.
A  more  computationally  intensive  method  for  localizing  a  source  at  an  electrode  involves  calculating  the
local source activity at any one electrode based on the average activity of its neighbors, weighted by their distance
from the source. The technique has the advantage of suppressing potentials that originate outside the measure-
ment area and weighing factors for implementing source deviation techniques for each of the electrodes in the
10–20 system are available.
