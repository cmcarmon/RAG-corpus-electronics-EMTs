A current is produced when an electron is forced 
from its orbit around an atom. Any form of energy 
that  dislodges electrons from atoms can be used to 
produce current. It is important to note that energy is 
not  created; rather, there is simply a transfer of  energy 
from one form to another. The source supplying the 
voltage is not simply a source of electrical energy. 
 Instead, it is the means of converting some other form 
of energy into electrical energy. The six most common 
voltage sources are friction, magnetism, chemicals, 
light, heat, and pressure.
