There are many examples where OSCAR can provide critical cost saving analysis. One example would be determining the benefit of adding grades in a shunting yard. Will the reduction in time spent shunting locomotives benefit the rail network economically for the years to follow? Or if a new signaling system was added allowing for increased speed limits, would the benefits out-weigh the costs?
