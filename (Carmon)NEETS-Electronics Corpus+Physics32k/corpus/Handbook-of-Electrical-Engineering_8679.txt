High-Level Language and Assembly Language Relations
In comparing the various assembly languages from the compiler-generated code, we have not presented a full
vocabulary of assembly languages or the minutiae of the underlying machines. Exploring only the code generated
by  the  compilers  may  lead  one  to  believe  that  all  assembly  languages  and  processor  architectures  are  pretty
much the same. This is not really the case. What we have shown is that compilers typically use the same assembly
language instructions regardless of the underlying machines. The compiler writer’s motivation for this apparent
similarity is not because all architectures are the same, but because it is difﬁcult—arguably even nonproduc-
tive—for  the  compiler  to  take  advantage  of  the  complex  features  which  some  CPU  architectures  offer.  An
argument may be made that compilers generate the best code by developing code rather independently of the
