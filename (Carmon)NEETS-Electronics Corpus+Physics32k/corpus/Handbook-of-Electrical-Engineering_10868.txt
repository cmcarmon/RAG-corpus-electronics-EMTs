By  creating  a  set  of  functions  in  this  way,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  build  up  a
“toolbox” of useful functions for a particular application domain. This is exactly
what happened shortly after the release of the original MATLAB. Entrepreneurs
quickly realized that if they cleaned up the code, added control oriented data types
and functions and some graphics capability, MATLAB could be resold as a proprietary CACSD package. So,
based mainly on the state-space methods in vogue in the U.S., several packages, such as MATRIXx and Ctrl-
C, emerged and were a great success.
