Determining vTH
(cid:3)
We first find vTH by computing the open-circuit voltage at the aa
port of the circuit in
Figure 3.72. We will find this voltage by applying the node method. Since the current
of the dependent source is expressible directly in terms of a node voltage, we can apply
the node method without modification.
