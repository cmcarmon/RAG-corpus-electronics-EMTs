Switching  circuit  outputs  are  loaded  by  the  inputs  of  the  devices  that  they  are  driving,  as  illustrated  in
Fig. 79.5. Worst case input loading current levels and output driving current capabilities are listed in Table 79.4
 of a driving device is the ratio between its output current capabilities
for various logic subfamilies. The 
at each logic level and the corresponding gate input current loading value. Switching circuits based on bipolar
transistors have fan-out limited primarily by the current-sinking and current-sourcing capabilities of the driving
device.
