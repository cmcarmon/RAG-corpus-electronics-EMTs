RCL circuits have a variety of properties, especially when driven by sinusoidal sources,
which will not be investigated here. My aim is simply to expose you to the area and get on
to more interesting topics. Driven oscillating systems also appear in other areas of physics
and hopefully you will encounter them there. The detailed considerations lead to discussions
on resonance and quality-factor Q.
