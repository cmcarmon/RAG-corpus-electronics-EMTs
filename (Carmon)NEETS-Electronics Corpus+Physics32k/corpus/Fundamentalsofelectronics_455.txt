The model spectrum idealizes the measured spectrum, and captures all the important features. The
measured spectrum certainly demonstrates what are known as pitch lines, and we realize from our model
that they are due to the vocal cord’s periodic excitation of the vocal tract. The vocal tract’s shaping of the
line spectrum is clearly evident, but diﬃcult to discern exactly, especially at the higher frequencies. The
model transfer function for the vocal tract makes the formants much more readily evident.
