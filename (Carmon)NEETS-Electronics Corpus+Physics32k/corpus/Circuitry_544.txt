microcontroller inputs can only accept digital input

and  the  positive  supply  (VDD  in  the  case  of  a 
CMOS microcontroller) is invariably 5 V Â± 5%. A 
level of approximately 0V indicates a logic 0 signal 
and  a  voltage  approximately  equal  to  the  positive 
power supply indicates a logic 1 signal.
