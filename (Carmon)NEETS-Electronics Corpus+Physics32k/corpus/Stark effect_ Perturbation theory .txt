Electric-field perturbation applied to a classical hydrogen atom produces a distortion of the electron orbit in a direction perpendicular to the applied field. This effect can be shown without perturbation theory using the relation between the angular momentum and the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector. Using the Laplace-Runge-Lenz approach, one can see both the transverse distortion and the usual Stark effect. The transverse distortion is not mentioned in most textbooks. This approach can also lead to an exactly solvable approximate model Hamiltonian for an atom in a strong oscillatory field. “There are few exactly-solvable problems in quantum mechanics, and even fewer with a time-dependent Hamiltonian.”
Turning now to quantum mechanics an atom or a molecule can be thought of as a collection of point charges (electrons and nuclei), so that the second definition of the dipole applies. The interaction of atom or molecule with a uniform external field is described by the operator

This operator is used as a perturbation in first- and second-order perturbation theory to account for the first- and second-order Stark effect.
