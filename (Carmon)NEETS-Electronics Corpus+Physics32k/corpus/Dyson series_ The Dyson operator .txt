Suppose that we have a Hamiltonian H, which we split into a free part H0 and an interacting part V, i.e. H = H0 + V.
We will work in the interaction picture here and assume units such that the reduced Planck constant ħ is 1.
In the interaction picture, the evolution operator U defined by the equation




Ψ
(
t
)
=
U
(
t
,

t

)
Ψ
(

t

0


)


{\displaystyle \Psi (t)=U(t,t_{0})\Psi (t_{0})}

is called the Dyson operator.
We have




U

{\displaystyle U(t,t)=I,}





U

U

t

)
,


{\displaystyle U(t,t_{0})=U(t,t_{1})U(t_{1},t_{0}),}






U

=
U

,


{\displaystyle U^{-1}(t,t_{0})=U(t_{0},t),}

and hence the Tomonaga–Schwinger equation,

{\displaystyle i{\frac {d}{dt}}U(t,t_{0})\Psi (t_{0})=V(t)U(t,t_{0})\Psi (t_{0}).}

Consequently,
