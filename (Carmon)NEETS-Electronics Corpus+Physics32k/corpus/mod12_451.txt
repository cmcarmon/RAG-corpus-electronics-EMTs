These voltage outputs can be plotted to show the response curve of the discriminator discussed
earlier (figure 3-10). When weak AM signals (too small in amplitude to reach the circuit limiting level)
pass through the limiter stages, they can appear in the output. These unwanted amplitude variations will
cause primary voltage ep [view (A) of figure 3-11] to fluctuate with the modulation and to induce a
similar voltage in the secondary of T1. Since the diodes are connected as half-wave rectifiers, these small
AM signals will be detected as they would be in a diode detector and will appear in the output. This
unwanted AM interference is cancelled out in the ratio detector (to be studied next in this chapter) and is
the main disadvantage of the Foster-Seeley circuit.
