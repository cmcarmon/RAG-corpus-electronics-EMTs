There’s a reason Georg Ohm has his name associated with resistance values 
as well as the law. The definition of an ohm, or unit of resistance, came from 
Georg Ohm’s work. The ohm is defined as the resistance between two points 
on a conductor when one volt, applied across those points, produces one 
amp of current through the conductor. I just thought you might like to know 
that. (Good that Georg’s last name wasn’t Wojciehowicz!)
