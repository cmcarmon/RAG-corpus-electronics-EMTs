The ﬁlter shapes the IF signal spectrum so that envelope detection is possible. The output
of the envelope detector contains the composite visual signal fc(t) and the frequency-modulated
aural carrier at 4.5 MHz. The latter is processing in a frequency demodulator to recover the
audio information for the loudspeaker. The former is sent through appropriate ﬁlters to separate
