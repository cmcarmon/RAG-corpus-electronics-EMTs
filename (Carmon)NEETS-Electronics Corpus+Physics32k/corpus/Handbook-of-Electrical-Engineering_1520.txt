However, the implementation of this method required the entire training corpus to be available online for
the  adaptation  process,  and  this  is  not  practical  in  many  situations.  This  problem  can  be  circumvented  if  a
model is stored for each of the training speakers, and the transformation is applied to the model. The trans-
formed models are then combined to produce the speaker-adapted model. However, due to the large number
of training speakers, storing the models of each training speaker would require a prohibitively large amount
of storage. Also, we may not have sufÔ¨Åcient data from each training speaker to robustly estimate the parameters
of the speaker-dependent model.
