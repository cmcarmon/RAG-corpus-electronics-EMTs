A new method for estimating the number of test cases required for software was developed in 1991 and is
starting to produce excellent results. A metric termed Function Points was invented by A. J. Albrecht of IBM
and placed in the public domain in 1978 [Albrecht, 1979]. This metric is derived from the weighted sums of
ﬁve parameters: the numbers of inputs, outputs, inquiries, logical ﬁles, and interfaces that constitute a software
application [Garmus, 1991]. The Function Point total of an application can be enumerated during the require-
ments and design phases.
