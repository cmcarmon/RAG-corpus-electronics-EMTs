For Voyager 1, with respect to the Sun:

{\displaystyle \mu =GM\,\!}
= 132,712,440,018 km3s−2 is the standard gravitational parameter of the Sun
r = 17 billion kilometers
v = 17.1 km/s
Hence:

Thus the hyperbolic excess velocity (the theoretical orbital velocity at infinity) is given by

However, Voyager 1 does not have enough velocity to leave the Milky Way. The computed speed applies far away from the Sun, but at such a position that the potential energy with respect to the Milky Way as a whole has changed negligibly, and only if there is no strong interaction with celestial bodies other than the Sun.
