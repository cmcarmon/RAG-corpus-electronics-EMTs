In the atmosphere,




N
≡




g
θ





d
θ


d
z







{\displaystyle N\equiv {\sqrt {{\frac {g}{\theta }}{\frac {d\theta }{dz}}}}}
, where



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is potential temperature,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the local acceleration of gravity, and



z


{\displaystyle z}
is geometric height.
In the ocean where salinity is important, or in fresh water lakes near freezing, where density is not a linear function of temperature,




N
≡


−


g
ρ





d
ρ


d
z







{\displaystyle N\equiv {\sqrt {-{\frac {g}{\rho }}{\frac {d\rho }{dz}}}}}
, where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, the potential density, depends on both temperature and salinity.
