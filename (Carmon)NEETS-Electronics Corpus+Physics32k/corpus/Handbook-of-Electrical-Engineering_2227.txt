Transport Properties
In a semiconductor the motion of an electron is affected by frequent collisions with phonons (quanta of lattice
vibrations), impurities, and crystal imperfections. In weak uniform electric Ô¨Åelds, %, the carrier drift velocity,
vd, is determined by the balance of the electric and collision forces:
