Again these results can be generalized to summarize the effect of negative
feedback on the effective output resistance of a circuit. If the Op Amp, the load
resistor RL and the feedback network appear to be connected in series, in a
loop, hence sharing a common current, then the output resistance will be high.
If the Op Amp, RL, and the feedback circuit all appear to be in parallel, tied
to a common node, sharing a common voltage, then the output resistance will
be low.
