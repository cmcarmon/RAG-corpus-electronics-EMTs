Extension cords, so commonly used at home and in industry, are also sources of potential
hazard. All cords should be regularly inspected for abrasion or cracking of insulation, and
repaired immediately. One sure method of removing a damaged cord from service is to unplug
it from the receptacle, then cut off that plug (the ”male” plug) with a pair of side-cutting pliers
to ensure that no one can use it until it is ﬁxed. This is important on jobsites, where many
people share the same equipment, and not all people there may be aware of the hazards.
