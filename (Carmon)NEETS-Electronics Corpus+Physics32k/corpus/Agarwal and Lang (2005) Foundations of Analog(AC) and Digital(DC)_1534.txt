For each of the circuits, select the time function on the right that corresponds in magni-
tude and shape to the output, vO(t). Assume that all capacitors and inductors have zero
initial states, (the appropriate state variable is zero for t less than zero). If no matching
response exists, say so and explain briefly. All responses are made up of ‘‘straight lines’’
and ‘‘exponentials.’’ You may choose a time function more than once. (Note that part
(d) shows an op-amp circuit. Op-amps will be covered in later chapters.)
e x e r c i s e 10.20 An RC network is shown in Figure 10.82. The voltage v and
the current i are constant for all time. Prior to t = 0, the circuit is in equilibrium with
the switch closed. At time t = 0, the switch is opened, and it is then closed some time
later. The waveform in Figure 10.83 is observed for vC(t).
