{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} ,t)=g(\phi (\mathbf {r} ,t))=g(\omega t-\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} )}

for virtually any well-behaved function g of dimensionless argument φ, where ω is the angular frequency (in radians per second), and k = (kx, ky, kz) is the wave vector (in radians per meter).
Although the function g can be and often is a monochromatic sine wave, it does not have to be sinusoidal, or even periodic. In practice, g cannot have infinite periodicity because any real electromagnetic wave must always have a finite extent in time and space. As a result, and based on the theory of Fourier decomposition, a real wave must consist of the superposition of an infinite set of sinusoidal frequencies.
In addition, for a valid solution, the wave vector and the angular frequency are not independent; they must adhere to the dispersion relation:

where k is the wavenumber and λ is the wavelength. The variable c can only be used in this equation when the electromagnetic wave is in a vacuum.
