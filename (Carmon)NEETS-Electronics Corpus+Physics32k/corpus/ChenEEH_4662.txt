With this problem deﬁnition and these assumptions, we will
need the following lemma. Lemma 1, (Ac, Bc) is controllable if
assumption 2 holds and the spectra of A(i), i ¼ 1, 2, . . . N do
not overlap (Fiagbedzi and Pearson, 1986).
We are now in a position to describe the controller design for
systems of equations 10.1 and 10.7. Generally speaking,
sliding-mode controller design consists of two steps, described
next.
