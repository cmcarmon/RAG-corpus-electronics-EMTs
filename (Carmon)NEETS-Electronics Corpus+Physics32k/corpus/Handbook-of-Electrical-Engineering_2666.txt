From an economic standpoint the most important metric for an IC is the “level of functional integration.”
Since the invention of the IC by Jack Kilby in 1958, the level of integration has steadily increased. The pleasant
result is that cost and physical size per function reduce continuously, and we enjoy a ﬂow of new, affordable
information processing products that pervade all aspects of our day-to-day lives. The historical rate of increase
is a doubling of functional content per chip every 18 months.
