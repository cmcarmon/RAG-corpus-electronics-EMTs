In computational complexity theory, a transcomputational problem is a problem that requires processing of more than 1093 bits of information. Any number greater than 1093 is called a transcomputational number. The number 1093, called Bremermann's limit, is, according to Hans-Joachim Bremermann, the total number of bits processed by a hypothetical computer the size of the Earth within a time period equal to the estimated age of the Earth. The term transcomputational was coined by Bremermann.
