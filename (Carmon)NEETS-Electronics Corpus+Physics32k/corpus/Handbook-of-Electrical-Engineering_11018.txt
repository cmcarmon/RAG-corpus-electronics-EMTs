Clinical EMG
When the electrical activity of skeletal muscle is examined for diagnostic purposes, an insulated needle electrode,
bare  only  at  the  tip  [Fig.  113.18(A)],  is  inserted  into  the  muscle  and  paired  with  a  skin-surface  electrode.
Another  skin-surface  electrode  is  used  to  ground  the  subject.  Occasionally  a  coaxial  needle  electrode
[Fig. 113.18(B)] or a bipolar hypodermic needle electrode [Fig. 113.18(C)] is used. In the latter case the outer
sleeve is used as the ground. A high-gain, differential ampliÔ¨Åer, oscilloscope, and loudspeaker are used, as shown
in Figure 113.18(D).
