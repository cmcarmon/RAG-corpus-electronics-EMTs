The resonant half-wavelength slot antenna is desirable be-
cause of its compact size; however, it has large input impedance,
typically larger than 300 V, which makes it difﬁcult to match to.
This can be circumvented by using an offset microstrip feed or
the folded slot antenna, which stems directly from the folded
dipole by Booker’s relation. In this case, the slot is folded in upon
itself. The overall length of the antenna remains approximately a
half-wavelength, but increasing the number of folds reduces the
radiation resistance. A folded slot with one fold will have one-
quarter the radiation resistance of a standard slot antenna. The
one-wavelength slot is also used with center-feeding because it
is fairly simple to achieve an input match.
