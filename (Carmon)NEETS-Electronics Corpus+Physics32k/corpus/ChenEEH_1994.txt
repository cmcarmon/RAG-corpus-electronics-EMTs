FIGURE 8.15 Fault Coverage Results for Full and Partial CFC Checking. The results are for external-cache/cache-less systems and in internal
cache systems with partial CFC respectively, for K Â¼ 2, and for two and four faults, averaged over a number of patterns (random, semiclustered,
fully clustered) for each number of faults.
