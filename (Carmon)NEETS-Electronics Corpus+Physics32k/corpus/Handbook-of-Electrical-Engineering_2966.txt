where beta (
 is the conducting voltage across the base-emitter
junction. This equation is the same for all ampliﬁer conﬁgurations. Looking at Fig. 28.3, the input circuit can
be  reduced  to  the  dc  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  28.4  using  circuit  analysis  techniques,  resulting  in  the  following
equations:
