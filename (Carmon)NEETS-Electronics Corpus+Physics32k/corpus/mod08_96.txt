Figure 1-11 shows an impedance-coupling network between two stages of amplification. L1 is the 
load for Q1 and develops the output signal of the first stage. Since the d.c. resistance of a coil is low, the 
efficiency of the amplifier stage is increased. The amount of signal developed in the output of the stage 
depends on the inductive reactance of L1. Remember the formula for inductive reactance:
