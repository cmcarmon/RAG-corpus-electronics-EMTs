Resistance is a property of all electrical components. 
Sometimes the effect of resistance is undesirable; other 
times it is constructive. Resistors are components 
manufactured to possess a specific value of resistance 
to the flow of current. A resistor is the most commonly 
used component in an electronic circuit. Resistors are 
available with fixed or variable resistance values. They 
are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to meet 
specific circuit, space, and operating requirements 
 (Figure 13‑2 and Figure 13‑3). Resistors are drawn 
schematically as a series of jagged lines, as shown in 
 Figure 13‑4. A resistor’s tolerance is the amount 
that the resistor may vary and still be acceptable. It 
is expensive for a manufacturer to hold a resistor to 
a certain value when an exact value is not needed. 
Therefore, the larger the tolerance, the cheaper it is to 
manufacture. Resistors are available with tolerances 
of 620%, 610%, 65%, 62%, and 61%. Precision re‑
sistors are available with even smaller tolerances. In 
most electronic circuits,  resistors of 10% tolerance are 
satisfactory.
