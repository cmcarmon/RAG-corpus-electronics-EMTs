with m rows, n columns, and elements aij from a ﬁeld F (or
alternatively, A 2 F mn). Deﬁne matrix addition (A þ B ¼ C)
element-wise (aij þ bij ¼ cij) for A, B, and C 2 F mn;

2, . . ., m; and j ¼ 1, 2, . . ., n. An additive identity is the zero
matrix, an m  n matrix whose every element is the additive
identity in F. For example, if F is the ring of integers or the ﬁeld
of real or complex numbers, then every element is simply 0. An
additive inverse of a matrix A with elements aij 2 F is found
