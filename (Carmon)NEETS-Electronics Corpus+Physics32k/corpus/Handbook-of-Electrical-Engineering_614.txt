Due  to  its  wide-band  nature,  a  signal  comprising  chaotic  basis  functions  is  potentially  more  resistant  to
multipath propagation than one constructed of sinusoids. Thus, chaotic digital modulation, where the digital
information  signal  to  be  transmitted  is  mapped  to  chaotic  waveforms,  is  potentially  useful  in  propagation
environments where multipath effects dominate.
