Inspired by the Machian nature of the Wheelerâ€“Feynman absorber theory for electrodynamics, Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar proposed their own theory of gravity in the context of general relativity. This model still exists in spite of recent astronomical observations that have challenged the theory. Stephen Hawking had criticized the original Hoyle-Narlikar theory believing that the advanced waves going off to infinity would lead to a divergence, as indeed they would, if the universe were only expanding. However, as emphasized in the revised version of the Hoyle-Narlikar theory devoid of the "Creation Field" (generating matter out of empty space) known as the Gravitational absorber theory, the universe is also accelerating in that expansion. The acceleration leads to a horizon type cutoff and hence no divergence. Gravitational absorber theory has been used to explain the mass fluctuations in the Woodward effect (see section on Woodward effect below).
