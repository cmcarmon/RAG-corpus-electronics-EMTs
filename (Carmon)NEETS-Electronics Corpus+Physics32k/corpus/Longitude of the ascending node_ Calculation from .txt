In astrodynamics, the longitude of the ascending node can be calculated from the specific relative angular momentum vector h as follows:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {n} &=\mathbf {k} \times \mathbf {h} =(-h_{y},h_{x},0)\\\Omega &={\begin{cases}\arccos {{n_{x}} \over {\mathbf {\left|n\right|} }},&n_{y}\geq 0;\\2\pi -\arccos {{n_{x}} \over {\mathbf {\left|n\right|} }},&n_{y}<0.\end{cases}}\end{aligned}}}

Here, n=<nx, ny, nz> is a vector pointing towards the ascending node. The reference plane is assumed to be the xy-plane, and the origin of longitude is taken to be the positive x-axis. k is the unit vector (0, 0, 1), which is the normal vector to the xy reference plane.
For non-inclined orbits (with inclination equal to zero), Ω is undefined. For computation it is then, by convention, set equal to zero; that is, the ascending node is placed in the reference direction, which is equivalent to letting n point towards the positive x-axis.
