The ratio that is called Q is a measure of the quality of resonant circuits and circuit components. 
Basically, the value of Q is an inverse function of electrical power dissipated through circuit resistance. Q 
is the ratio of the power stored in the reactive components to the power dissipated in the resistance. That 
is, high power loss is low Q; low power loss is high Q.
