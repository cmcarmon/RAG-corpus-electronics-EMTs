Lowest Valid Input Voltage
Notice from Figure 7.36 that the input voltage must be greater than VT for the
MOSFET to exit its cut off region. When the input voltage is VT, the MOSFET
exits its cutoff region and the output voltage of the amplifier is VS. When the
input voltage is equal to VT, any positive value of vDS will cause the MOSFET
to operate in its saturation region. Because we design the amplifier with VS > 0,
and since vDS = VS, the MOSFET will be in its saturation region. Since VT is
the lowest voltage for which the MOSFET is in saturation, we get
