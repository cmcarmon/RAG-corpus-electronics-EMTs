The core SIP protocol, speciﬁed in Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF) Request for Comments (RFC) 2543, is built on
foundation IP protocols, such as HTTP and Simple Mail Trans-
fer Protocol (SMTP). As such, it supports a request/response
transaction model that is text-based, similar to e-mail, and self-
describing; in addition, SIP inherited many of the features from
standard Internet protocols. For example, it uses many of
HTTPv1.1 header ﬁelds, supports Uniform Resource Identi-
ﬁer/Universal Resource Locator (URI/URL) for addressing,
and employs the Multimedia Internet Mail Encapsulation
(MIME) protocol for message payload description. It is light-
weight as the baseline SIP consists only of six methods. Exten-
sions are being proposed by adding new methods, new headers,
and new message body types to support additional applications
such as interworking with legacy systems, cable, or wireless
applications. An SIP initiation scenario is shown in Figure 8.1.
