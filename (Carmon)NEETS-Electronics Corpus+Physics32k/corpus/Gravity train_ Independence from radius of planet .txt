The time constant



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
depends only on





g
R




{\displaystyle {\frac {g}{R}}}
so if we expand that we get

which depends only on the gravitational constant and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
the density of the planet. The size of the planet is immaterial; the journey time is the same if the density is the same.
