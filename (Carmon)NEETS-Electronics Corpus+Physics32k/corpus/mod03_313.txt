There are many kinds of electrical and electronic circuits that require protection. In some of these
circuits, it is important to protect against temporary or transient current increases. Sometimes the device
being protected is very sensitive to current and cannot withstand an increase in current. In these cases, a
fuse must open very quickly if the current increases.
