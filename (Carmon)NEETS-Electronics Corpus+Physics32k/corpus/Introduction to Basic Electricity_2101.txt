That the current is directly proportional to the voltage 
across the circuit is a very simple yet profound state-
ment. The first part of the statement simply means 
that as the voltage changes, so does the current, and 
the change is in the same direction (i.e., if the voltage 
increases, then the current increases; similarly, if the 
voltage decreases, then the current decreases). The 
second part of Ohmâ€™s law states that current is inversely 
proportional to resistance. inversely  proportional 
simply means that when one thing occurs, the  opposite 
happens to the other quantity. In this case, if resistance 
increases, then current decreases.
