The contact ‘bounce’ that occurs when a switch is 
operated  results  in  rapid  making  and  breaking  of 
the switch until it settles into its new state. Figure 
16.13 shows the waveform generated by the simple 
switch  input  circuit  of  Fig.  16.11  as  the  contacts 
close. The spurious states can cause problems if the 
switch  is  sensed  during  the  period  in  which  the 
switch contacts are in motion, and hence steps must 
be  taken  to  minimize  the  effects  of  bounce.  This 
may  be  achieved  by  using  some  extra  circuitry  in 
the  form  of  a  debounce  circuit  or  by  including 
appropriate  software  delays  (of  typically  4  to  20 
ms)  so  that  spurious  switching  states  are  ignored. 
We shall discuss these two techniques separately.
