shaft  of  a  high-performance  dc  servomotor.  The  ﬁber  is  taken  up  on  a  proper-diameter  spool.  The  ﬁber  is
wound on the spool at close to zero tension with the help of a catenary control. In some cases ﬁber is proof-
tested in-line before it is wound on a spool. The proof stress can be set at different levels depending on the
application for which the ﬁber is being manufactured.
