Thus far we have discussed a variety of circuits containing linear devices such
as resistors and voltage sources. We have also discussed methods of analyz-
ing linear circuits built out of these elements. In this chapter, we extend our
repertoire of network elements and corresponding analysis techniques by intro-
ducing a nonlinear two-terminal device called a nonlinear resistor. Recall, from
Section 1.5.2, a nonlinear resistor is an element that has a nonlinear, alge-
braic relation between its instantaneous terminal current and its instantaneous
terminal voltage. A diode is an example of a device that behaves like a non-
linear resistor. In this chapter, we will introduce methods of analyzing general
circuits containing nonlinear elements, trying whenever possible to use analysis
methods already introduced in the preceding chapters. Chapter 7 will develop
further the basic ideas on nonlinear analysis and Chapter 8 will expand on
the concept of incremental analysis introduced in this chapter. Chapter 16 will
elaborate on diodes.
