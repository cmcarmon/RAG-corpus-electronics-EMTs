While it is possible to use the approximation



E
=
p
c


{\displaystyle E=pc}
, this neglects all information of the mass. In some cases, even with



p
≫
m


{\displaystyle p\gg m}
, the mass may not be ignored, as in the derivation of neutrino oscillation. A simple way to retain this mass information is using a Taylor expansion rather than a simple limit. The following derivation assumes



c
=
1


{\displaystyle c=1}
(and the ultrarelativistic limit



p
c
≫
m

c

2




{\displaystyle pc\gg mc^{2}}
). Without loss of generality, the same can be showed including the appropriate



c


{\displaystyle c}
terms.
