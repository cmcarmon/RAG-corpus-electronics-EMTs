The swing equation of the single-machine system of Fig. 61.54 can be solved either graphically or analytically.
For  graphical  integration,  which  is  called  equal-area  criterion,  we  represent  the  machine  by  its  subtransient
reactance, assuming that electrical power can be calculated by Eq. (61.71), and during the transients the shaft
power Ps remains constant. Then, using the power-angle curve(s), we sketch the locus of operating point on
the curve(s) and equate the areas for stability. Figure 61.55 shows an example for which the shaft power of the
machine is suddenly increased from the initial value of Po to Ps.
