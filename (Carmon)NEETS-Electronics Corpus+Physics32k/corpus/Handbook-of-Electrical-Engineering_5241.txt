Smaller generators are directly connected in parallel using a busbar. Each generator is protected by a circuit
breaker.  The  power  plant  auxiliary  system  is  supplied  from  the  same  busbar.  The  transmission  lines  are
connected to the generator bus, either directly or through a transformer.
