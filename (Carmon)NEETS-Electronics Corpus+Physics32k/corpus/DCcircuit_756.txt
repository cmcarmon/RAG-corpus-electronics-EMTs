Any current through coil 1 (through a measured resistance connected between the test
leads) tends to drive the needle to the left of scale, back to zero. The internal resistor values of
the meter movement are calibrated so that when the test leads are shorted together, the needle
deﬂects exactly to the 0 Ω position.
