This problem is well modeled by Figure 9.33 with V being a voltage step. Hence,
Equation 9.78 and Figure 9.39 apply. Since the current slope is to be 10 mA in 100 µs,
or 100 A/s, and since the inductance is 10 mH, the voltage must be 1 V.
A second way to solve this problem is to use Equation 9.27 with L = 10 mH and
i = 10 mA to determine that the voltage source must deliver a flux linkage of 10
−4 Wb.
Since this flux linkage is to be delivered at a constant rate over a 100-µs period, the
voltage must be 1 V.
