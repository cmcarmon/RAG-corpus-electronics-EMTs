I = 5 A
So, before the switch is even closed, we have a current through the inductor of 5 amps,
rather than starting from 0 amps as in the previous inductor example. With the switch closed
(the ﬁnal condition), the 1 Ω resistor is shorted across (bypassed), which changes the circuit’s
total resistance to 2 Ω. With the switch closed, the ﬁnal value for current through the inductor
would then be:
