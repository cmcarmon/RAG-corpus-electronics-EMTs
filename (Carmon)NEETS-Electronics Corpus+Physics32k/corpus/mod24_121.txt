It is known that bound rays propagate in fibers due to total internal reflection, but how do these light
rays enter the fiber? Rays that enter the fiber must intersect the core-cladding interface at an angle greater
than the critical angle (ï¿½ c). Only those rays that enter the fiber and strike the interface at these angles will
propagate along the fiber.
