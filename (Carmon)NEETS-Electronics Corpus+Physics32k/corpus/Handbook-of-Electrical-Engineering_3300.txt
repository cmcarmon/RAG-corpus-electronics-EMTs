In an extrinsic photoconductor (see Fig. 31.9), the photon excites an electron from the valence band into
the  acceptor  level  corresponding  to  the  hole  of  the  acceptor  atom.  The  resulting  energy hu  is  much  smaller
than the bandgap and is the reason why these detectors have applications for long wavelength infrared sensors.
Table 31.4 is a list of commercial photoconductors and their peak wavelength sensitivities.
