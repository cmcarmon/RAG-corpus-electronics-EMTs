When dividing conductors to form two or more branches, follow the procedure illustrated in figure 
2-42. Bind the conductors with at least six turns between two marling hitches, and continue the lacing 
along one of the branches, as shown in view A. Start a new lacing along the other branch. To keep the 
bends in place, form them in the conductors before lacing. Always add an extra marling hitch just prior to 
a breakout as shown in view B.
