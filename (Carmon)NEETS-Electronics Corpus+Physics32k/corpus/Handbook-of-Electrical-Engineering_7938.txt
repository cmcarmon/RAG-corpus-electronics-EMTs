are applied to the clock input. The master-slave ﬂip-ﬂops are triggered by a low-to-high transition of the clock.
The  “terminal  count”  and  “ripple  clock”  outputs  facilitate  cascading  of  several  counters.  The  ripple  clock
carry/borrow output signal, RCO, is a pulse equal in length to the clock pulse when the counter overﬂows or
underﬂows, that is, when it is incremented from 1111 or decremented from 0000. By using this signal to reload
the value at the data inputs we create a counter of modulus less than 16. Figure 81.39, for example, shows the
arrangement to give a modulo-5 count, by reloading 1011 each time the ripple clock pulse occurs.
