The four dimensions of length, time, mass and electromagnetism underlie everything realisable, and together form the system of electromechanical units. These dimensions have an irreducible relationship to the physical world; there must be one unit for each, or some things will not be sensibly measurable, and the system will fall into chaos or contradiction. Nothing that we know of requires another (fifth) orthogonal dimension and unit of measure. But because some kinds of perceptual phenomena do not have readily quantifiable dimensions in the electromechanical units, additional human-perceptual base units were defined: one for temperature, illumination, and quantity of substance.
