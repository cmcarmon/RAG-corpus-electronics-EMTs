A  qualitative  sketch  of  Vt ,  the  voltage  across  terminals  of  an
unloaded  simple  dc  generator,  as  a  function  of  time  is  given  in
Fig. 66.8.  Note  that  this  voltage  is  not  a  constant.  A  unidirectional
current can ï¬‚ow when a resistor is connected across the terminals of
the machine.
