To figure out how much voltage is dropped across each resistor, you use 
Ohm’s Law for each individual resistor. You know the value of each resis-
tor, and you now know the current flowing through each resistor. Remember 
that current (I) is the battery voltage (9 V) divided by the total resistance 
(R1 + R2, or 1.22 kΩ), or approximately 7.4 mA. Now you can apply Ohm’s 
Law to each resistor to calculate its voltage drop:
