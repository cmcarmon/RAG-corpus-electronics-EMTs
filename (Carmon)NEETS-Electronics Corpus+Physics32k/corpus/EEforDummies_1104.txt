Multimeter test leads have conical tips that 
you hold in contact with the component 
you’re testing. You can purchase special 
spring‐loaded test clips that slip over the 
tips, making it easier for you to attach the 
test leads to the component leads or other 
wires. (See Figure 16-2.) These insulated test 
clips ensure a good connection between the 
test leads and whatever it is you’re testing, 
while preventing accidental contact with 
another part of the circuit.
