The center cycle of three cycles provides you with an undistorted waveform in its correct phase. The
center of a two-cycle presentation will appear inverted, but will be undistorted. To place waveforms on
the CRT in this manner, you must understand the relationship between horizontal and vertical
frequencies. The relationship between the frequencies of the waveform on the vertical plates and the
sawtooth on the horizontal plates determines the number of cycles on the screen, as shown in figure 6-33.
