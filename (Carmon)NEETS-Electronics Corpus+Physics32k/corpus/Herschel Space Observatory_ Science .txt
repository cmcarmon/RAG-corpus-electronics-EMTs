Herschel specialised in collecting light from objects in the Solar System as well as the Milky Way and even extragalactic objects billions of light-years away, such as newborn galaxies, and was charged with four primary areas of investigation:
Galaxy formation in the early universe and the evolution of galaxies;
Star formation and its interaction with the interstellar medium;
Chemical composition of atmospheres and surfaces of Solar System bodies, including planets, comets and moons;
Molecular chemistry across the universe.
During the mission, Herschel "made over 35,000 scientific observations" and "amass[ed] more than 25,000 hours' worth of science data from about 600 different observing programs".
