(c) The incoherent receiver is more commonly used because of the phase sensitivity problem inherent in
coherent reception. Here, the receiver full-wave rectiﬁes the received signal and lowpass ﬁlters the
result (again ideally). Analyze this receiver. Does its output diﬀer from that of the coherent receiver
in a signiﬁcant way?
