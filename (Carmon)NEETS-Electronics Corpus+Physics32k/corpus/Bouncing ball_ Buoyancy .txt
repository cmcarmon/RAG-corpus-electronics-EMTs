Any object immersed in a fluid such as water or air will experience an upwards buoyancy. According to Archimedes' principle, this buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In the case of a sphere, this force is equal to

{\displaystyle F_{\text{B}}={\frac {4}{3}}\pi r^{3}\rho g.}

The buoyant force is usually small compared to the drag and Magnus forces and can often be neglected. However, in the case of a basketball, the buoyant force can amount to about 1.5% of the ball's weight. Since buoyancy is directed upwards, it will act to increase the range and height of the ball.
