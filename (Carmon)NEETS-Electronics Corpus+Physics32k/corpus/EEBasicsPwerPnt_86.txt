Voltage is always measured between 
two points in a circuit
Sometimes we refer to a “voltage drop”
or “voltage difference” between two 
points
Other times voltage is stated with 
respect to a reference point called 
“ground” (usually the negative source of 
power)
Voltage drops occur across components
The voltage between one end of a wire 
to the other is zero
