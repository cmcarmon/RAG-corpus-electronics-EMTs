The problem of derived signature-based monitoring of
processors with built-in caches was, to the best of our know-
ledge, addressed for the ﬁrst time by Rota (2002). An external
observer cannot guess the instructions fetched by the processor
from its cache, and the integration of the WD into the proces-
sor core cannot be performed in off-the-shelf commercial
systems. Rota (2002) developed a solution to this problem in
which the processor explicitly sends information about the
instructions that are actually being fetched from the cache. A
very simple solution would be to modify the processor in such
a way that every instruction fetched from the cache is also
asserted on the external bus. Unfortunately, it is not realistic to
assume that the external signature transfer time on the external
memory bus followed by the concurrent signature computa-
tion and error analysis that a WD needs to perform is compar-
able to the processing speed of a pipelined processor with one
or more cache levels. A solution was needed that would allow
the watchdog to perform a derived signature control ﬂow
checking at a reasonable speed. It was assumed that the exter-
nal watchdog is able to process instructions at the rate of the
external bus clock frequency, which is usually smaller than the
processor clock frequency.
