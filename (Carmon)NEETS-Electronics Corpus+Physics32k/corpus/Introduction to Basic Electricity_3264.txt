There are two important types of MOSFETs: N-
type units with N channels and P-type units with P 
channels. N-type units with N channels are called 
 depletion	mode devices because they conduct when 
zero bias is applied to the gate. In the depletion mode, 
the electrons are conducting until the gate bias volt-
age depletes them. The drain current is depleted as a 
negative bias is applied to the gate. P-type units with 
P channels are  enhancement	mode devices. In the 
enhancement mode, the electron flow is normally cut 
off until it is aided or enhanced by the bias voltage on 
the gate. Although P-channel depletion MOSFETs and 
N-channel enhancement MOSFETs exist, they are not 
commonly used.
