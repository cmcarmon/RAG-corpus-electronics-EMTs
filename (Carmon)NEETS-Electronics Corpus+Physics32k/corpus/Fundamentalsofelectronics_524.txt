5.1 Introduction to Digital Signal Processing1
Not only do we have analog signals — signals that are real- or complex-valued functions of a continuous
variable such as time or space — we can deﬁne digital ones as well. Digital signals are sequences, functions
deﬁned only for the integers. We thus use the notation s (n) to denote a discrete-time one-dimensional signal
such as a digital music recording and s (m, n) for a discrete-“time” two-dimensional signal like a photo taken
with a digital camera. Sequences are fundamentally diﬀerent than continuous-time signals. For example,
continuity has no meaning for sequences.
