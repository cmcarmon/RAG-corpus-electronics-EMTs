In high electric ﬁelds, electron-hole pairs in a semiconductor
are often generated by impact ionization. In this process, an
electron (or a hole) acquires enough energy from the electric
ﬁeld to break a bond and promote another electron from the
valence band into the conduction band. The electron impact
ionization generation rate, Gni, is proportional to the electron
concentration, n, to the electron velocity, vn, and to the impact
ionization coefﬁcient, ani:
