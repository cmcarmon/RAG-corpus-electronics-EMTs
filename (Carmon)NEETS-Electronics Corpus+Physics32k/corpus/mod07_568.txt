You may check a capacitor suspected of being open by disconnecting it from the circuit and 
checking it with a capacitor analyzer. You can check a capacitor suspected of being leaky with an 
ohmmeter; if it reads less than 500 kilohms, it is more than likely bad. However, capacitor troubles are 
difficult to find since they may appear intermittently or only under operating voltages. Therefore, the best 
check for a faulty capacitor is to replace it with one known to be good. If this restores proper operation, 
the fault was in the capacitor.
