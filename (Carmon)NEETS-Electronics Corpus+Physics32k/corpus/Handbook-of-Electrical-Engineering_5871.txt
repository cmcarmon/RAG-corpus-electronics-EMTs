Dynamic  models.  When  a  power  system  is  in  a  steady  state  (i.e.,
operated at an equilibrium), the electrical output of each generator is
equal to the power applied to the rotor shaft. (Various losses have been
neglected without affecting the essential ideas provided in this discus-
sion.)  Disturbances  occur  frequently  in  power  systems,  however.
Examples of disturbances are load changes, short circuits, and equip-
ment outages. A disturbance results in a mismatch between the power
input and output of generators, and therefore the rotors depart from
their  synchronous-speed  operation.  Intuitively,  the  impact  is  more
severe for machines closer to the disturbance. When a system is per-
turbed, there are several possibilities for its subsequent behavior. If the
disturbance is small, the machines may soon reach a new steady speed,
which is close to or identical to their synchronous speed, in which case
the system is said to be stable. It may also happen that some machines speed up while others slow down. In a
more complicated situation, a rotor may oscillate about its synchronous speed. This results in an unstable case.
An  unstable  situation  can  result  in  abnormal  changes  in  system  frequency  and  voltage  and,  unless  properly
controlled, may lead to damage to machines (e.g., broken shafts). To study these phenomena, dynamic models
are required. Details of a dynamic model depend on a number of factors such as location of disturbance and
time duration of interest. An overview of dynamic generator models is given here. In essence, there are two
aspects that need be modeled: electromechanical and electromagnetic.
