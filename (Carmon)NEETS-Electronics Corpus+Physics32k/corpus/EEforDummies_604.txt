One end of the channel is known as the source, the other end of the channel 
is called the drain, and the control mechanism is called the gate. By applying 
a voltage to the gate, you control the flow of current from the source to the 
drain. Leads are attached to the source, drain, and gate. Some FETs include 
a fourth lead so you can ground part of the FET to the chassis of the circuit. 
(But don’t confuse these four‐legged creatures with dual‐gate MOSFETs, which 
also have four leads.)
