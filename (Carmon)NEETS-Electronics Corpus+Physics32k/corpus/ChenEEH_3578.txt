The rapid development of integrated circuit technology led to
the development of very powerful digital machines able to
perform a very high number of computations in a very short
period of time. In addition, digital machines are ï¬‚exible, reli-
able, reproducible, and relatively cheap. As a consequence,
several signal processing tasks originally performed in the
analog domain have been implemented in the digital domain.
In fact, several signal processing tools are only feasible to be
implemented in the digital domain.
