The Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Origin
The heart is two double-muscular pumps. The atria pump blood into the ventricles, then the two ventricles
contract.  The  right  ventricle  pumps  venous  blood  into  the  lungs,  and  the  left  ventricle  pumps  oxygen-rich
blood into the aorta. Figure 113.12 is a sketch of the heart and great vessels, along with genesis of the ECG.
