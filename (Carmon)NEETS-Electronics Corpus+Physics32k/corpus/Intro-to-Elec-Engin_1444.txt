Demodulation of SSB signals also requires the use of a phase-coherent reference. Figure
15.2.10 shows the general conÔ¨Åguration to demodulate the SSB signal. A small carrier component,
which is transmitted along with the message, is inserted. A balanced modulator is used for
frequency conversion of the bandpass signal to low pass or baseband.
