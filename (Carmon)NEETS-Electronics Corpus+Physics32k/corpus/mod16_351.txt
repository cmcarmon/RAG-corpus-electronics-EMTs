The value of series resistance is determined by the current required for full-scale deflection and by
the range of the voltages to be measured. Since the current through the meter circuit is directly
proportional to the applied voltage, the meter scale can be calibrated directly in volts for a fixed value of
series resistance. For example, letâ€™s assume that the basic meter is to be made into a voltmeter with a full-
scale deflection of 1 volt. The coil resistance of the basic meter is 100 ohms, and 100 microamperes of
current causes full-scale deflection. The resistance (R
