By similar reasoning we can say that: 
 
2 × 2 × 2 = 23
and 
 
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24
In  these  examples,  the  number  that  we  have  used 
(i.e. 2) is known as the base whilst the number that 
we have raised it to is known as an index. Thus, 24
is called ‘two to the power of four’, and it consists 
of a base of 2 and an index of 4.  Similarly, 53 is 
called ‘five to the power of 3’ and has a base of 5
