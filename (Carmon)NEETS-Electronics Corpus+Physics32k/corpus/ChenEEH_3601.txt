In general, for implementations with high signal-to-quan-
tization noise ratios, sections of order two are preferred. Dif-
ferent
types of structures can be used for second-order
sections, such as the direct-form structures shown in Figures
2.15(A) and 2.15(B) or alternative biquadratic structures like
state-space (Diniz and Antoniou, 1986).
