The demultiplexed video signal is, hopefully, the same as the transmitted signal (“F”). We use letters with
quotation marks to indicate that the signals are estimates of their transmitted counterpart. This reproduced
video signal is decompressed, using the inverse algorithm of that used in the transmitter, to yield an estimate
of the original differential picture signal (“E ”). The predict block in the receiver implements the same algorithm
as that of the transmitter. Its inputs are the reconstructed motion signal (“C ”) and the previous reconstructed
frame (“B”). When the predictor output (“D”) is added to the reconstructed differential picture signal (“E ”),
the result is a reconstructed version of the current frame.
