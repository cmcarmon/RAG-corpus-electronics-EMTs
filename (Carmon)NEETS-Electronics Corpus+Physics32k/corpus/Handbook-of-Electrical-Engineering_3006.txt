The preceding three equations underscore several operating characteristics that distinguish the common base
ampliﬁer  from  its  common  emitter  counterpart.  For  example,  Eq.  (28.35)  suggests  a  low  frequency  input
resistance  that  is  signiﬁcantly  smaller  than  that  of  a  common  emitter  unit.  To  underscore  this  contention,
consider the case of two identical transistors, one used in a common emitter ampliﬁer and the other used in
a common base conﬁguration, that are biased at identical quiescent operating points. Under this circumstance,
Eqs. (28.35) and (28.13) combine to deliver
