In contrast, short-distance and military systems tend to use only multimode technology. Examples of
short-distance systems include process control and local area networks (LANs). Short-distance and
military systems have many connections. The larger fiber core and higher fiber numerical aperture (NA)
of multimode fibers reduce losses at these connections. Chapter 4 explains fiber connection properties in
more detail. Chapter 2 provides more detail on multimode and single mode fibers.
