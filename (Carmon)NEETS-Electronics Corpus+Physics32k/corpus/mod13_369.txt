The circuits described previously are very simple clocks. However, as the complexity of the system
increases, so do the timing requirements. Complex systems have multiphase clocks to control a variety of
operations. Multiphase clocks allow functions involving more than one operation to be completed during
a single clock cycle. They also permit an operation to extend over more than one clock cycle.
