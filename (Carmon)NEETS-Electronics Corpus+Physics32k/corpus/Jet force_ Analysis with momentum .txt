To calculate the speed of the vessel due to the jet force itself, analysis of momentum is necessary. Conservation of momentum states the following:

{\displaystyle m1v1+m2v2=m1v1f+m2v2f}

In this situation, m1 represents the mass of the gas in the propulsion system, v1 represents the initial speed of this gas, m2 represents the mass of the rocket, and v2 represents the initial velocity of the rocket. On the other end of the equation, v1f represents the final velocity of the gas and v2f represents the final velocity of the rocket. Initially, both the gas in the propulsion system and the rocket are stationary, leading to v1 and v2 equaling 0. As such, the equation can be simplified to the following:




0

m

v

{\displaystyle 0=m1v1f+m2v2f}

After some more simple algebra, we can calculate that v2 (the velocity of the rocket) is the following:

{\displaystyle v2f=-(m1v1)/m2}

This gives us the velocity of the aircraft right after it takes off. Because we know all forces acting on it from this point on, we can calculate net acceleration using Newton's second law. Given the velocity that the aircraft takes off with and the acceleration at any point, the velocity can also be calculated at any given point.
