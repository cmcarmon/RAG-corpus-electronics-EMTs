. Expedited forwarding (EF) PHB: EF PHB dictates that
the departure rate of a trafﬁc class from any router must
equal or exceed the conﬁgured rate. Thus, for a trafﬁc
class belonging to EF PHB, during any interval of time, it
can be conﬁdently said that departure rate from any
router will equal or exceed the aggregate arrival rate at
that router. This has strong implications on the queuing
delay that is experience by the packet. In this case, the
queuing delay can be guaranteed to be bounded and is
negligible (limited by the link bandwidth). EF PHB is
used to provide premium service (having low delay and
jitter) to the customer. However, EF PHB requires a very
strong admission control mechanism. The admission
control algorithm will basically ensure that the arrival
rate of trafﬁc belonging to EF PHB is less than the
departure rate conﬁgured at any router in its path. More-
over, proper functioning of EF PHB demands strict po-
licing. This job can be carried out by the Ingress routers.
If packets are found to be in violation of the contract,
they can be either dropped or demoted to a lower trafﬁc
class.
