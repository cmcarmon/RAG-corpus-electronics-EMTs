Directionality of a relay operation is quite important in
many applications. It is established based on the angle of the
fault current with the respect to the line voltage. It can be
established for current alone or for impedance. In the latter
case, the directionality is detected by looking at the angle
between the reference voltages and fault current. In the imped-
ance plane, the directionality is detected by the quadrant where
the impedance falls. Whether the calculated fault impedance
is in a forward (ﬁrst-quadrant) or reverse (third-quadrant)
zone determines the directions of the fault. Typically, the zone
associated with the reverse direction is called a reverse zone
and is numbered in a sequence after the forward zones are
numbered ﬁrst. The directionality may also be based on
the power calculation, which in turn determines the direction
of the power ﬂow to/from a given power system component.
Besides being used for implementation of the transmission
line relaying schemes, directionality is quite important when
applying overcurrent principle and is often used when imple-
menting various approaches to ground protection.
