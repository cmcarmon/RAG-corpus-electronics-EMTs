This model takes into account a statistical approach for calculating the variables like species mass fractions, temperature and density while the mixture composition is calculated at the grids. Then these all variables are calculated as functions of the mixture fraction around a presumed probability distribution function. The model can produce satisfactory results for turbulent reactive flows where convection effects due to mean and fluctuating components of velocity are dominant. The model can be extended for adiabatic as well as non adiabatic conditions.
