In axial compensation, the thermal expansion of a straight line section between two fixed points is absorbed by an axial expansion joint. The distance between two fixed points defines the pipeline length requiring compensation, and thus determines the axial movement that must be achieved by the expansion joint.
The following basic principles apply to axial compensation:
The single-plane or multi-plane piping system is subdivided into straight sections by fixed point in such a way that each section can be compensated by a single axial expansion joint.
The fixed points must be designed to withstand the pressure and spring forces of the axial expansion joint, the frictional forces of the pipe guides and the flow forces.
Long pipes must be protected against kinking between the fixed points using pipe guides.
The axial expansion joint should be installed in the immediate vicinity of a fixed point and a pipe guide.
Impermissibly large fixed point loads can be prevented by using axial expansion joints that are relieved of pressure forces.
