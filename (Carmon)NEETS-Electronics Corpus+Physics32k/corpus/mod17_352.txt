Synchronous systems have certain advantages over asynchronous systems. The amount of time taken 
to transmit stop and start elements is made available for information transmission rather than for 
synchronizing purposes. Only the intelligence elements are transmitted. In start-stop signaling, the ability 
of the receiving device to select the proper line signal condition is dependent upon signal quality. For 
example, suppose the stop-to-start transition arrives before it should; then, because of atmospherics, all 
subsequent selection positions in that character will appear earlier in time in each code element. A 
synchronous system has a higher capability for accepting distorted signals because it does not depend on a 
start-stop system for synchronization.
