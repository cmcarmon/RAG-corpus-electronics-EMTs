Figure 6.1 shows the dollar volume for MEMS products as a
function of year as compiled and projected by several studies.
It is striking that the compilations vary so widely in their
absolute value and in their rate of growth. The variance in
values is due to differences in what is included in the study: for
example, are micromachined ink jet print heads counted as
MEMS or not? Some studies also include products enabled by
the availability of MEMS devices. However, all the studies
indicate that the production of MEMS is already a multibillion
dollar industry that doubles every 2 to 4 years. The associated
growth rates of 17 to 35% are noteworthy.
