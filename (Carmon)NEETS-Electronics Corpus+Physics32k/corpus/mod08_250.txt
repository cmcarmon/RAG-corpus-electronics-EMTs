Now you have been shown the way in which an rf amplifier is configured to amplify a band of
frequencies and the way in which an rf amplifier can be "tuned" for a particular band of frequencies. You
have also seen some ways in which the bandpass of an rf amplifier can be adjusted. However, the
frequencies at which rf amplifiers operate are so high that certain problems exist.
