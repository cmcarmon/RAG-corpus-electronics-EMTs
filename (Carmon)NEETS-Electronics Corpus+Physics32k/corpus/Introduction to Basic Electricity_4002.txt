When an inductor and a capacitor are connected in 
parallel, they form what is called a tank	circuit. When 
a tank circuit is excited by an external DC source, it 
oscillates; that is, it produces a back-and-forth current 
flow. If it were not for the resistance of the circuit, the 
tank circuit would oscillate forever. However, the resis-
tance of the tank circuit absorbs energy from the cur-
rent, and the oscillations of the circuit are dampened.
