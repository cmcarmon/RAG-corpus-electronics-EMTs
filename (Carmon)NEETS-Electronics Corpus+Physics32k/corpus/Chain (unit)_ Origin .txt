The chain was commonly used with the mile to indicate land distances and in particular in surveying land for legal and commercial purposes. Starting in the 19th century, the chain was used as a subdivision with the mile to show distances between railway stations, tunnels and bridges. In medieval times, many practical measures were in everyday use, often defined locally with inconsistencies from place to place.
In countries influenced by English practice before about 1960, land parcel sales usually specified lengths in chains and links, and areas in acres. A rectangle of land one furlong long and one chain wide has an area of one acre.
