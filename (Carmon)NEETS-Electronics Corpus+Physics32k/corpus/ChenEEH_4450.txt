For a time-varying linear system driven by Gaussian white
noise, the Kalman ﬁlter gain sequence can be derived as
the optimal estimator from the least-squares, maximum-
likelihood, and mean-squares perspectives. The estimator
discussion of this chapter was initiated with the assumed
‘‘linear update’’ of equation 4.8. This assumption is not re-
strictive in the sense that it can be shown for linear systems
with additive noise Gaussian white measurement and process
noise that a linear measurement update is optimal (i.e., a
nonlinear estimator will not achieve better performance).
The Kalman ﬁlter also has the property that the measurement
residual r(k) is a white noise sequence.
