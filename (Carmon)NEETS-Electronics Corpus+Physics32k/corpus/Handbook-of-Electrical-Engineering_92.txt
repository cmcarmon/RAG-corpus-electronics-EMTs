The impedance of a capacitor (Fig. 1.14) is frequency-depen-
dent. The initial downward slope is caused by the capacitive reac-
tance XC . The trough (lowest impedance) is almost totally resistive, and the upward slope is due to the capacitor’s
self-inductance XL. An ESR plot would show an ESR decrease to about 5–10 kHz, remaining relatively constant
thereafter.
