This  discussion  reviews  some  of  the  basic  issues  involved  in  CEM  and  includes  only  the  detail  needed  to
illustrate the central ideas involved. The underlying principles that unify the various modeling approaches used
in  electromagnetics  are  emphasized  while  avoiding  most  of  the  speciÔ¨Åcs  that  make  them  different.  Listed
throughout are representative, but not exhaustive, numbers of references that deal with various specialty aspects
of  CEM.  For  readers  interested  in  broader,  more  general  expositions,  the  well-known  book  on  the  moment
method  by  Harrington  [1968];  the  books  edited  by  Mittra  [1973,  1975],  Uslenghi  [1978],  and  Strait  [1980];
the  monographs  by  Stutzman  and  Thiele  [1981],  Popovic,  et al.  [1982],  Moore  and  Pizer  [1984],  and Wang
[1991]; and an IEEE Press reprint volume on the topic edited by Miller et al. [1991] are recommended, as is
the article by Miller [1988] from which this material is excerpted.
