The unit of conductance is the MHO (G), which is ohm spelled backwards. Recently the term mho
has been redesignated SIEMENS (S). Whereas the symbol used to represent resistance (R) is the Greek

between resistance (R) and conductance (G) or (S) is a reciprocal one. A reciprocal of a number is one
divided by that number. In terms of resistance and conductance:
