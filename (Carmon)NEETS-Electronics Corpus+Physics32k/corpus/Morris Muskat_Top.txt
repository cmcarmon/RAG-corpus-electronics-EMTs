Morris Muskat (21 April 1906 â€“ 20 June 1998) was an American petroleum engineer. Muskat refined Darcy's equation for single phase flow, and this change made it suitable for the petroleum industry. Based on experimental results worked out by his colleagues, Muskat and Milan W. Meres also generalized Darcy's law to cover multiphase flow of water, oil and gas in the porous medium of a petroleum reservoir. The generalized flow equation provides the analytical foundation for reservoir engineering that exists to this day.
