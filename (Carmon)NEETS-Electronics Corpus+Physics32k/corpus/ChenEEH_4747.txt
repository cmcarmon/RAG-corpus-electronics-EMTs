Remark 1
The representation error bounds and the size of the ideal
parameter vectors are assumed known because they affect the
size of the residual set to which the states converge. It is
possible to augment
the direct adaptive algorithm with
‘‘auto-tuning’’ capabilities similar to Polycarpou and Mears
(1998), which would relax the need for these bounds.
Furthermore, note that the stability result of theorem 1 is
semiglobal in the sense that it is valid in the compact sets Svi
and Sxi , i ¼ 1, . . ., n, which can be made arbitrarily large. The
stability result may be made global by adding a high-gain
bounding control term to the control law. Such a term may
be particularly useful when, due to a complete lack of a priori
knowledge, the control designer is unable to guarantee that the
compact sets Sxi , i ¼ 1, . . ., n, are large enough so that the
state will not exit them before the controller has time to
bring the state inside Dd; moreover, it may also happen that
due to a poor design and poor system knowledge, Dd is not
contained in Sxn . In this case, too, bounding control terms may
be helpful until the design is reﬁned and improved. Using
bounding control, however, requires explicit knowledge of
functional upper bounds of jcc
i (v, Xi)j and also of the lower
, i ¼ 1, . . . , n, whose knowledge we do not mandate
bounds cc

in theorem 1. Bounding terms may be added to the diffeo-
morphism in theorem 1, but we do not present the analysis
since it is similar to the one we present here and it is algebra-
ically tedious; we simply note, though, that the bounding
terms have to be smooth (because they need to be differenti-
