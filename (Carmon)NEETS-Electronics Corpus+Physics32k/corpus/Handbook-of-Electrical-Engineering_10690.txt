Navigation  is  with  respect  to  a  coordinate  frame  of  the  designer’s  choice.  Short-range  robots  navigate  with
respect to the local terrain or a building’s walls. For navigation over hundreds of kilometers (e.g., automobiles
and trucks), various map grids exist whose coordinates can be calculated from latitude-longitude (Fig. 109.1).
NATO land vehicles use a Universal Transverse Mercator grid. Long-range aircraft and ships navigate relative
to an earth-bound coordinate frame, the most common of which are latitude-longitude-altitude and rectangular
x, y, z (Fig. 109.1). The most accurate world-wide reference ellipsoid is described in [WGS-84, 1991]. Spacecraft
