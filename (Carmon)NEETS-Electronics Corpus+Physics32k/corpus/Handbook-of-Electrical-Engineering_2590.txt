An additional advantage of the MOSFET is that it can be made using either electrons or holes as channel
carrier. Using both types of devices in so-called complementary MOS (CMOS) technology allows circuits that
draw no dc power if current paths include at least one series connection of both types of device because, in
steady state, only one or the other type conducts, not both at once. Of course, in exercising the circuit, power
is drawn during switching of the devices. This ï¬‚exibility in choosing n- or p-channel devices has enabled large
circuits to be made that use low power levels. Hence, complex systems can be manufactured without expensive
packaging or cooling requirements.
