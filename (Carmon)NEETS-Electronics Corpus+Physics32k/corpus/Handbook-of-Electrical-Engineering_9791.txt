Any one of these six possible model forms, or others, might constitute the result of box 8 in Fig. 100.2. Discrete-
time system models have similar choices of form, including an nth-order difference equation as given in Eq.
(100.1) or a z-transform input-output transfer function as given in Eq. (100.2). A set of n Ô¨Årst-order difference
equations (state equations) analogous to Eq. (100.5) or (100.6) also can be written.
