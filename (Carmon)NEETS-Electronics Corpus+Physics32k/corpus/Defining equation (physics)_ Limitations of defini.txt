Definitions vs. functions: Defining quantities can vary as a function of parameters other than those in the definition. A defining equation only defines how to calculate the defined quantity, it cannot describe how the quantity varies as a function of other parameters since the function would vary from one application to another. How the defined quantity varies as a function of other parameters is described by a constitutive equation or equations, since it varies from one application to another and from one approximation (or simplification) to another.
Examples
Mass density ρ is defined using mass m and volume V by but can vary as a function of temperature T and pressure p, ρ = ρ(p, T)
The angular frequency ω of wave propagation is defined using the frequency (or equivalently time period T) of the oscillation, as a function of wavenumber k, ω = ω(k). This is the dispersion relation for wave propagation.
The coefficient of restitution for an object colliding is defined using the speeds of separation and approach with respect to the collision point, but depends on the nature of the surfaces in question.
Definitions vs. theorems: There is a very important difference between defining equations and general or derived results, theorems or laws. Defining equations do not find out any information about a physical system, they simply re-state one measurement in terms of others. Results, theorems, and laws, on the other hand do provide meaningful information, if only a little, since they represent a calculation for a quantity given other properties of the system, and describe how the system behaves as variables are changed.
Examples
An example was given above for Ampere's law. Another is the conservation of momentum for N1 initial particles having initial momenta pi where i = 1, 2 ... N1, and N2 final particles having final momenta pi (some particles may explode or adhere) where j = 1, 2 ... N2, the equation of conservation reads:





∑

∑

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}^{N_{1}}\mathbf {p} _{\rm {i}}=\sum _{j}^{N_{2}}\mathbf {p} _{\rm {j}}\,\!}

Using the definition of momentum in terms of velocity:





p

=
m

v





{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} \,\!}

so that for each particle:






p

=

m

v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\rm {i}}=m_{i}\mathbf {v} _{\rm {i}}\,\!}
and





p

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} _{\rm {j}}=m_{j}\mathbf {v} _{\rm {j}}\,\!}

the conservation equation can be written as

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}^{N_{1}}m_{i}\mathbf {v} _{\rm {i}}=\sum _{j}^{N_{2}}m_{i}\mathbf {v} _{\rm {i}}.\,\!}

It is identical to the previous version. No information is lost or gained by changing quantities when definitions are substituted, but the equation itself does give information about the system.
