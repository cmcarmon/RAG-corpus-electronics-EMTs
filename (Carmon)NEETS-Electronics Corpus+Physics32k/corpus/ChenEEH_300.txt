The concept of modulating the electrical current in a semicon-
ductor by an external electrical ﬁeld was ﬁrst proposed by
Julius Lilienfeld in the 1930s. Years later, William Shockley,
a scientist at Western Electric, led a research program to create
a semiconductor device based on this ‘‘ﬁeld effect’’ concept. To
replace bulky vacuum tubes then used in telephone switching.
Two scientists in Shockley’s team, W. Brattain and J. Bardeen,
invented the point contact transistor in 1947. Subsequently,
Shockley invented the bipolar-junction transistor
(BJT).
Shockley later developed the junction ﬁeld effect transistor
(JFET); however, the JFET was not able to challenge the dom-
inance of BJT in many applications. The development of ﬁeld
effect devices continued with moderate progress until the early
1960s, when the metal-oxide-silicon ﬁeld effect transistor
(MOSFET) emerged as a prominent device. This device
quickly became popular in semiconductor memories and
digital integrated circuits. Today, the MOSFET dominates the
integrated circuit technology, and it is responsible for the
computer revolution of the 1990s.
