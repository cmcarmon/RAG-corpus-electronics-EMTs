Proper-acceleration's relationships to coordinate acceleration in a specified slice of flat spacetime follow from Minkowski's flat-space metric equation (cdτ)2 = (cdt)2 - (dx)2. Here a single reference frame of yardsticks and synchronized clocks define map position x and map time t respectively, the traveling object's clocks define proper time τ, and the "d" preceding a coordinate means infinitesimal change. These relationships allow one to tackle various problems of "anyspeed engineering", albeit only from the vantage point of an observer whose extended map frame defines simultaneity.
