The next state is shown in figure 3-5. The negative voltage accumulated on the right side on 
capacitor C1 has caused Q2 to conduct. Now the following sequence of events takes place almost 
instantaneously. Q2 starts conducting and quickly saturates, and the voltage at output 2 changes from 
approximately âˆ’VCC to approximately 0 volts. This change in voltage is coupled through C2 to the base of 
Q1, forcing Q1 to cutoff. Now Q1 is in cutoff and Q2 is in saturation. This is the circuit situation shown 
in figure 3-6.
