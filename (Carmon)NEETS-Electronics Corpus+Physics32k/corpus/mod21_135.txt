Pushbutton S302E and potentiometers R401 and R405 (fig. 2-2) are used for balancing the
transconductance (Gm) bridge circuit under actual tube operating current. Pressing S302E removes the
grid signal and allows a zero balance to be made with one potentiometer or the other, depending upon
whether the tube under test is passing high or low plate current. Lamp DS108 on the front panel lights
when S302E is pressed. Pushbutton S302C is used for checking grid-to-cathode shorts at a sensitivity
much higher than the normal tests. Results of this test are indicated by the short test lamps on the front
panel.
