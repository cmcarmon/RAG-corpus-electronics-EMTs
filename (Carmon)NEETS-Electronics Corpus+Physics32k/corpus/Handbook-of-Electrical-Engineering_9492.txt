Data Deﬁnition and Manipulation in Relational Databases
Upon completion of the relational database design, a descriptive language, usually referred to as Data Deﬁnition
Language (DDL), is used to deﬁne the designed schemes and their relationships. The DDL can be used to create
new schemes or modify existing ones, but it cannot be used to query the database. Once DDL statements are
compiled,  they  are  stored  in  the  data  dictionary.  A  data  dictionary  is  a  repository  where  information  about
database schemas, such as attribute names, indexes, and integrity constraints are stored. Data dictionaries also
contain  other  information  about  databases,  such  as  design  decisions,  usage  standards,  application  program
descriptions,  and  user  information.  During  the  processing  of  a  query,  the  DBMS  usually  checks  the  data
dictionary. The data dictionary can be seen as a relational database of its own. As a result, data manipulation
languages that are used to manipulate databases can also be used to query the data dictionary.
