Ampliﬁer Sense System
The purpose of the ampliﬁer sense system is to reliably detect the rate of electrical activity of the heart so that
the pacemaker can determine if there is a need for therapy. The ampliﬁer must have a high input impedance
to ensure adequate signal amplitude. The system must reject all forms of external noise so that no inappropriate
counting occurs. The electrical activity on the heart is manifested as deﬂections in an electrogram measured
