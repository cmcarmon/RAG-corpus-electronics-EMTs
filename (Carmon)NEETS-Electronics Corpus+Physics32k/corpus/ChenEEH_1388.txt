To ease the development of reconﬁgurable designs, it is
desirable to automate the identiﬁcation of reconﬁgurable
regions (Shirazi et al., 1998a). This involves the following
steps: (1) identiﬁcation of identical or similar components
between two successive designs and (2) placement of such
components to minimize reconﬁguration time. An example
of this process is shown in Figure 3.1. In this design, blocks A,
B, and C are present in both design 1 and design 2, while block
D is present only in design 1 and block E only in design 2.
Given these two designs, the task of a tool is to produce a run-
time reconﬁgurable (RTR) design such that, when reconﬁg-
uring from design 1 to design 2, only block D needs to be
reconﬁgured to block E. In other words, the blocks have to be
physically aligned to minimize the reconﬁgurable region
covered by blocks D and E; blocks A, B, and C are outside
the reconﬁgurable region and will not be reconﬁgured.
