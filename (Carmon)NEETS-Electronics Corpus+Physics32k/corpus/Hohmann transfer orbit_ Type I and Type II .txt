An ideal Hohmann transfer orbit transfers between two circular orbits in the same plane and traverses exactly 180째 around the primary. In the real world, the destination orbit may not be circular, and may not be coplanar with the initial orbit. Real world transfer orbits may traverse slightly more, or slightly less, than 180째 around the primary. An orbit which traverses less than 180째 around the primary is called a "Type I" Hohmann transfer, while an orbit which traverses more than 180째 is called a "Type II" Hohmann transfer.
