Equation 14.21 gives the complete response for our parallel circuit for a
cosine tone burst of frequency ω1. As t becomes large, the first term dies away,
and only the second cosine term with frequency ω1 remains. Accordingly, the
second term is the steady-state response to a cosine of frequency ω1.
