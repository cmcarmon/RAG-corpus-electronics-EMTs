Among other things, it means that a theory possessing a UV fixed point may not be an effective field theory, because it is well-defined at arbitrarily small distance scales. At the UV fixed point itself, the theory can behave as a conformal field theory.
The converse statement, that any QFT which is valid at all distance scales (i.e. isn't an effective field theory) has a UV fixed point is false. See, for example, cascading gauge theory.
Noncommutative quantum field theories have a UV cutoff even though they are not effective field theories.
Physicists distinguish between trivial and nontrivial fixed points. If a UV fixed point is trivial (generally known as Gaussian fixed point), the theory is said to be asymptotically free. On the other hand, a scenario, where a non-Gaussian (i.e. nontrival) fixed point is approached in the UV limit, is referred to as asymptotic safety. Asymptotically safe theories may be well defined at all scales despite being nonrenormalizable in perturbative sense (according to the classical scaling dimensions).
