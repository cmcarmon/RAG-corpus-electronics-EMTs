The input signal named S stands for set while the input signal named
R stands for reset. Manufacturers often select Q as the output signal name
for bistable devices in their data books. The Qs on the outputs are added
for clarity and are not part of the IEEE symbol. The S-R NOR latch shown
in Fig. 79.16 is a basic latch circuit since the S and R inputs are not gated
with  a  control  signal.  The  reduced  characteristic  table  in  Table  79.9
shows the operation of the S-R NOR latch circuit.
