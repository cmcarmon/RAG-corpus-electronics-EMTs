Hospitals also have large clinical staffs which include nurses and technologists (who are hospital employees)
and medical doctors (who are usually not hospital employees). Clinicians are educated in the biological and
medical  sciences,  and  their  preparation  generally  includes  a  large  component  of  practical  experience  in  the
hospital as well as theoretical study in the classroom. As hospital employees, nurses and technologists (respi-
ratory, laboratory, etc.) are part of the administrative structure of the hospital. Medical doctors (physicians and
surgeons), on the other hand, are part of a separate medical staff structure that is largely independent of the
hospital’s  administrative  structure.  However,  medical  doctors  control  the  admission  and  discharge  of  the
hospital’s patients, and many hospital activities are the result of medical orders for patient services.
