The components of ak correspond to the elements of matrix A along its  kth antidiagonal in which vector ao
corresponds  to  the  main  antidiagonal  [i.e.,  elements  A(1,n),  A(2,n  â€“  1),  etc.],  vector  a1  to  the  antidiagonal
immediately  below  the  main  antidiagonal,  and  so  forth.  The  projection  operator  PH mapping  A  into  AH as
governed by relationship (14.121) is designated by
