The effective mass of the spring in a spring-mass system when using an ideal spring of uniform linear density is 1/3 of the mass of the spring and is independent of the direction of the spring-mass system (i.e., horizontal, vertical, and oblique systems all have the same effective mass). This is because external acceleration does not affect the period of motion around the equilibrium point.
We can find the effective mass of the spring by finding its kinetic energy. This requires adding all the mass elements' kinetic energy, and requires the following integral, where



u


{\displaystyle u}
is the velocity of mass element :




T

{\displaystyle T=\int _{m}{\frac {1}{2}}u^{2}\,dm}

Since the spring is uniform,

m


{\displaystyle dm=\left({\frac {dy}{L}}\right)m}
, where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the length of the spring. Hence,

The velocity of each mass element of the spring is directly proportional to its length, i.e.

{\displaystyle u={\frac {vy}{L}}}
, from which it follows:

Comparing to the expected original kinetic energy formula

we can conclude that effective mass of spring in this case is m/3. Using this result, we can write down the equation of motion of the spring by writing the Lagrangian in terms of the displacement

Note that
