The analog-to-digital (a/d) converter section changes the dc output voltage from the signal
conditioning section to digital information. The a/d converter uses a voltage-to-frequency conversion
technique. A dc voltage at the input of the a/d converter is changed to a frequency by the analog
integrated circuit (ic). This frequency is characteristic of the magnitude and polarity of the dc input
voltage. Counting of the output frequency from the analog ic is accomplished by the digital ic. The
resulting count is transferred in binary format to the display section. (Binary number systems are covered
in NEETS, Module 13, Introduction to Number Systems, Boolean Algebra, and Logic Circuits.)
