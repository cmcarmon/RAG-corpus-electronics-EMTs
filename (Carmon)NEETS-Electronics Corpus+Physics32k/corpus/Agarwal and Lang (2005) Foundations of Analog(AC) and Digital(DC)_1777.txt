Finally, notice that if the ringing is sufficiently under damped then vC can fall below VOL
and then rise again above VOH one or more times. However, this behavior does not
violate the combinational gate abstraction because the definition of the combinational
gate in the presence of delay (see Section 10.4.1) does not constrain the gateâ€™s opera-
tion following an input transition during a time interval whose length is equal to the
propagation delay.
