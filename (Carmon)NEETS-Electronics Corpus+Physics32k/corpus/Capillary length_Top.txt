In fluid mechanics, capillary length is a characteristic length scale for an interface between two fluids which is subject both to gravitational acceleration and to a surface force due to surface tension in the interface.
The capillary length is defined as:





λ

c


=



γ

ρ
g






{\displaystyle \lambda _{c}={\sqrt {\frac {\gamma }{\rho g}}}}
,
where



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid, and



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the surface tension of the fluid-fluid interface.
For clean water and air at standard temperature and pressure, the capillary length is around 2.7 mm.
For a soap bubble in air, the capillary length is around 4 meters (13 feet).
A capillary surface that has a characteristic length smaller than the capillary length can be considered a low Bond number surface. A sessile drop whose largest dimension is smaller than the capillary length, for example, will take the shape of spherical cap, which is the solution to the Young-Laplace equation with gravity completely absent.
