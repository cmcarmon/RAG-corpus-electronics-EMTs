Diffusion Charge and Capacitance
Minority carriers injected into a NR result in a diffusion charge
Qd and an associated diffusion capacitance of Cd. These are
strong functions of bias and can become much larger than Qj
and Cj, respectively, at high forward bias. Combining continuity
and transport equation, assuming the small-signal case, with
transformation into frequency domain (q=qt ! jv) yields again
a second-order differential equation that enables the calculation
of the frequency and spatially dependent injected excess carrier
densities as well as the corresponding injected small-signal
terminal current densities. Adding both the hole and electron
current components yields the total small-signal terminal cur-
rent Id(v). Division by the applied small-signal voltage V (v)
gives the small-signal admittance Yd(v) ¼ Gd þ jvCd of the
pn-diode. For the most interesting case of a strongly nonsym-
metrical junction (e.g., NA  ND) with a short NR width wn
and frequencies that are not too high (i.e., jvtn  1), one
obtains for the case of low injection (Lindmayer and Wrigley,
1965), assuming V > 4VT , with the dc bias current Id:
