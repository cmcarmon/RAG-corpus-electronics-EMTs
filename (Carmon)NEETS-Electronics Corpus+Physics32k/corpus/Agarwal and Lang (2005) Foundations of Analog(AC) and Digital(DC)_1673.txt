shown in Figure 9.3. In Section 10.4 we analyzed this waveform in detail and
found that it contains a decaying exponential. This decaying exponential is
the homogeneous response of the first-order circuit formed by the Th√©venin
equivalent of the first inverter and the MOSFET gate capacitance in the sec-
ond inverter. Now suppose that the interconnect between the two inverters is
long, so that its parasitic inductance also becomes important. In this case, the
dynamics of the cascaded inverters change considerably, and the waveform of
vIN2 takes on the second-order character shown in Figure 12.3.
