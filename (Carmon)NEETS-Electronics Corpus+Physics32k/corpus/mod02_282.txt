Since the values of resistance and reactance are both given in ohms, it might at first seem possible to 
determine the value of the impedance by simply adding them together. It cannot be done so easily, 
however. You know that in an ac circuit which contains only resistance, the current and the voltage will 
be in step (that is, in phase), and will reach their maximum values at the same instant. You also know that 
in an ac circuit containing only reactance the current will either lead or lag the voltage by one-quarter of a 
cycle or 90 degrees. Therefore, the voltage in a purely reactive circuit will differ in phase by 90 degrees 
from that in a purely resistive circuit and for this reason reactance and resistance are rot combined by 
simply adding them.
