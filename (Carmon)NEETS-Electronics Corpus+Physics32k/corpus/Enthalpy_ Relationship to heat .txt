In order to discuss the relation between the enthalpy increase and heat supply, we return to the first law for closed systems: dU = δQ − δW. We apply it to the special case with a uniform pressure at the surface. In this case the work term can be split into two contributions, the so-called pV work, given by p dV (where here p is the pressure at the surface, dV is the increase of the volume of the system) and all other types of work δW′, such as by a shaft or by electromagnetic interaction. So we write δW = p dV + δW′. In this case the first law reads:




d
U

,


{\displaystyle dU=\delta Q-p\,dV-\delta W',}

or




d

=
δ
Q
+
V

d

.


{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q+V\,dp-\delta W'.}

From this relation we see that the increase in enthalpy of a system is equal to the added heat:




d

=
δ
Q
,


{\displaystyle dH=\delta Q,}

provided that the system is under constant pressure (dp = 0) and that the only work done by the system is expansion work (δW' = 0).
