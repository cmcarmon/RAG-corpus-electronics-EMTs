where the constant of integration K is zero. Thus for large RC, the capacitor
voltage is approximately the integral of the input voltage. This is a very useful
signal-processing property. In Chapter 15 we will show that a much closer
approximation to ideal integration can be obtained by adding an Op Amp to
the circuit.
