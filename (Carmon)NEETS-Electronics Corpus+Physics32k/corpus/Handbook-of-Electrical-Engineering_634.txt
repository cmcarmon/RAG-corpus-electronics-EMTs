Due to the nonperiodic property of chaotic signals, the energy of chaotic sample functions varies from one
sample  function  to  the  next,  even  if  the  same  symbol  is  transmitted.  If  the  mean  bit  energies ∫
2(t)dt  and
∫
2(t)dt associated with symbols “1” and “0,” respectively, are sufﬁciently different, then a CSK transmission
T g2
can be demodulated without synchronization. In this case, the bit energy can be estimated by a correlator at
the  receiver,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.28,  without  recovering  the  basis  functions.  The  decision  as  to  which  symbol
was transmitted is made by comparing this estimate against a threshold.
