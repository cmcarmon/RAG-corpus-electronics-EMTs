■● Work History: Different experiences from various 
employments can have a  positive  effect when look-
ing for solutions.
Diversity can be used to bring people together 
to share a common experience in the workforce. 
 Workplace diversity can also develop creative  discussion 
and inventive  solutions based on the  differences in 
 experience and knowledge that each employee brings to 
the team (Figure 3-2).
