Electrostriction
 is the basic electromechanical coupling mechanism in centric crystals and amorphous solids.
It  has  been  recognized  as  the  primary  electromechanical  coupling  in  centric  materials  since  early  in  the
20th century [Cady, 1929]. Electrostriction is the quadratic coupling between the strain developed in a material
 is a better-known linear
and the electric Ô¨Åeld applied, and it exists in all insulating materials. 
coupling mechanism that exists only in materials without a center of symmetry.
