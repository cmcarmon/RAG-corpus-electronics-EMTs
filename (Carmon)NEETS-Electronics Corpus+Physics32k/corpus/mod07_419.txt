Filtering is accomplished by the use of capacitors, inductors, and/or resistors in various 
combinations. Inductors are used as series impedances to oppose the flow of alternating (pulsating dc) 
current. Capacitors are used as shunt elements to bypass the alternating components of the signal around 
the load (to ground). Resistors are used in place of inductors in low current applications.
