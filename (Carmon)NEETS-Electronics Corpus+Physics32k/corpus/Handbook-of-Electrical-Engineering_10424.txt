This fundamental modeling philosophy has been used successfully by several investigators. Wohl developed
the SHOR model of decisionmaker action using the ideas from modern systems theory. The SHOR, in con-
junction with planning models (see Fig. 103.3) can be phrased in analytical terms compatible with those of the
electromechanical  subsystems. With  their  common  form,  all  of  the  submodels  can  be  combined  to  create  a
comprehensive system description, integrating people with hardware and software algorithms. This model is
useful in system architecture studies because it is applicable to all military echelon levels; it represents the fast
dynamics  of  the  system  explicitly  rather  than  by  implicit  relational  blocks  or  physical  interconnection  of
subsystem elements, and there is ï¬‚exibility to allow whether a function is best performed by a human or by
an algorithm.
