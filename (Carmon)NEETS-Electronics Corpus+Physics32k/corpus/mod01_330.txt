The voltage across the electrodes depends upon the materials from which the electrodes are made 
and the composition of the electrolyte. The current that a cell delivers depends upon the resistance of the 
entire circuit, including that of the cell itself. The internal resistance of the cell depends upon the size of 
the electrodes, the distance between them in the electrolyte, and the resistance of the electrolyte. The 
larger the electrodes and the closer together they are in the electrolyte (without touching), the lower the 
internal resistance of the cell and the more current the cell is capable of supplying to the load.
