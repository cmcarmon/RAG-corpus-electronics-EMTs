the  switch  is  opened  and  the  10-V voltage  source  is
disconnected from the circuit. The 
voltage source is now operative,
so the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(b). After a long time, the
circuit  reaches  steady  state  and  the  capacitor  acts  like  an  open  circuit
again. We obtain
