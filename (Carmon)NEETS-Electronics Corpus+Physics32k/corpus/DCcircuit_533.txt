With a little more observation, it becomes apparent that the voltage drop across each re-
sistor is also a ﬁxed proportion of the supply voltage. The voltage across R1, for example, was
10 volts when the battery supply was 45 volts. When the battery voltage was increased to 180
volts (4 times as much), the voltage drop across R1 also increased by a factor of 4 (from 10 to
40 volts). The ratio between R1’s voltage drop and total voltage, however, did not change:
