A crossbar is the central portion of a crossbar switch fabric which connects the inputs to the outputs. A set of decisions of which inputs are connected to which outputs must be made each arbitration period. In high speed cell switching or packet switching applications, the arbitration period is very short. There are often millions or billions of arbitration periods per second.
An arbiter is the circuit that makes the decision as to which of the crossbar's many switches should be closed. Speed is a key design criterion of an arbiter in some applications.
