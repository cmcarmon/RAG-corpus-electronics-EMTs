If you want to understand the ins and outs of one or more of the electronic 
components you use in these projects, review the material in Chapters 4–7 
and 9–12. You’ll find information on switches in Chapter 4, details about 
resistors and Ohm’s Law in Chapters 5 and 6 respectively, and a treatise on 
capacitors in Chapter 7. Chapter 9 explains diodes, Chapter 10 discusses 
transistors, and two of the integrated circuits (ICs) used in these projects are 
covered in Chapter 11. Wires, power sources, and other parts (for instance, 
sensors, speakers, and buzzers) are discussed in Chapter 12.
