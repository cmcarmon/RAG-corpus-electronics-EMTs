The nonlinear behavior of the victim driver gate during the
transition should be captured (Supamas et al., 2001). The
industrial noise analysis tool, ClariNet, has considered this
issue. Results on industrial designs were presented to demon-
strate the effectiveness of this tool with an 8% error compared
to SPICE simulations.
