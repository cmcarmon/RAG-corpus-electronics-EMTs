PULSE-CODE MODULATION (pcm) refers to a system in which the standard values of a
QUANTIZED WAVE (explained in the following paragraphs) are indicated by a series of coded pulses.
When these pulses are decoded, they indicate the standard values of the original quantized wave. These
codes may be binary, in which the symbol for each quantized element will consist of pulses and spaces:
ternary, where the code for each element consists of any one of three distinct kinds of values (such as
positive pulses, negative pulses, and spaces); or n-ary, in which the code for each element consists of nay
number (n) of distinct values. This discussion will be based on the binary pcm system.
