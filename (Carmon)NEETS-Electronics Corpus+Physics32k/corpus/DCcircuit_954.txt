Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) tells us that the algebraic sum of all voltages in a loop
must equal zero, so we can create more equations with current terms (I1, I2, and I3) for our
simultaneous equations. To obtain a KVL equation, we must tally voltage drops in a loop of the
circuit, as though we were measuring with a real voltmeter. I’ll choose to trace the left loop of
this circuit ﬁrst, starting from the upper-left corner and moving counter-clockwise (the choice
of starting points and directions is arbitrary). The result will look like this:
