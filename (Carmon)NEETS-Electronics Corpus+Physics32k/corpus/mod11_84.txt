If the tube is to operate efficiently, the plate current must be in phase with the grid-signal voltage and 
180 degrees out of phase with the plate voltage. When transit time approaches 1/4 cycle, this phase 
relationship between the elements does not hold true. A positive swing of a high-frequency grid signal 
causes electrons to leave the cathode and flow to the plate. Initially this current is in phase with the grid 
voltage. However, since transit time is an appreciable part of a cycle, the current arriving at the plate now 
lags the grid-signal voltage. As a result, the power output of the tube decreases and the plate power 
dissipation increases. Another loss of power occurs because of ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION.
