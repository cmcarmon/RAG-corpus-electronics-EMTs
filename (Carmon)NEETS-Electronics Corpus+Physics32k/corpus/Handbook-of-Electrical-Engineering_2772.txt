The gate array technology shares the costs of masks among all ASIC customers and exploits high-volume
production of the noncustomized wafers. On the other hand, construction of higher-level functions must adhere
to the predeﬁned positions and type of gate cells, leading to less-efﬁcient and lower-performance designs than
in  the  standard  cell  approach.  In  addition,  the  width  of  the  wiring  channel  is  ﬁxed,  limiting  the  number  of
parallel interconnections in the channel and imposing wasted area if all available wires are not used.
