Laser diodes are much more complex than LEDs. Laser is an acronym for light amplification by the
stimulated emission of radiation. Laser diodes produce light through stimulated emission when a current
is passed through them. Stimulated emission describes how light is produced in any type of laser. In the
laser diode, photons, initially produced by spontaneous emission interact with the laser material to
produce additional photons. This process occurs within the active area of the diode called the laser cavity.
The process does not affect the original photon. The stimulated photon has many of the same properties
(wavelength, direction, phase) as the original photon.
