Schmidt couplings have been refined to come in several coupling designs, including the following:
* Schmidt Offset Couplings: Schmidt couplings which transmit constant angular velocity and torque in a wide range of parallel shaft misalignment.
* Semi flex Couplings: Semiflex coupling is a torsionally stiff and restoring-force-free precision coupling. In addition to the compensation of axial and angular displacements, it provides high radial displacement capacity together with compact design
* Schmidt Inline Couplings: Schmidt couplings which accommodate small parallel shaft misalignment at constant angular velocity.
* Control flex Couplings:Control flex is a precision coupling designed to meet the mechanical and metrological requirements of encoders. Through its unique function element, the compact shaft encoder coupling combines extremely low restoring force and low stress on the encoder bearings with constant angle-synchronous transmission of the rotary movement
* Schmidt 5-D Couplings: Schmidt couplings which provide parallel shaft misalignment and a ±5° angular misalignment with moderate axial shaft displacement capabilities.
