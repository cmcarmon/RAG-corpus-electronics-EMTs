II. Factorization of Denominator Polynomial. The next step of the partial fraction expansion method entails
the  factorizing  of  the  nth-order  denominator  polynomial  A(s)  into  a  product  of  n  Ô¨Årst-order  factors.  This
factorization is always possible and results in the equivalent representation of A(s) as given by
