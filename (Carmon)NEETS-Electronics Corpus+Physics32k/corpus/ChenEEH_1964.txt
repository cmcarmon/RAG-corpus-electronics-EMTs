The most widely used techniques assign signatures as labels to
the nodes of the CFG to determine the control ï¬‚ow. The WD is
provided with the reference signatures and the relationships
among them (represented by the CFG). During run time, the
WD monitors the program run and concurrently computes the
signatures that are then compared to the reference ones provided
earlier. If a discrepancy is detected, then an error is signaled.
