Naturally, all registers from the circuit C are preserved when
constructing the circuit graph GC as described in deﬁnition
4.3—these registers are enumerated 1 through r, and a vertex vi
is created in the graph for each register Ri. Alternatively, an
edge between two vertices is added in the graph if there is one
or more local data paths between these two vertices. The self-
loops are discarded because the clock skew of these local data
paths is always zero and cannot be manipulated in any way.
