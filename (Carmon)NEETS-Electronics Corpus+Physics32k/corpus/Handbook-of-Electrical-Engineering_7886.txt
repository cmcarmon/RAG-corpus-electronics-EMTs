Sequential Logic Circuits
A sequential logic circuit is a circuit that has feedback such that the output signals of the circuit are functions
of all or part of the present state output signals of the circuit in addition to any external input signals to the
circuit. The vast majority of sequential logic circuits designed for industrial applications are synchronous or
clock-mode circuits.
