Satellite Launch
Launching a communications satellite into orbit is a complex and expensive process. This ﬁrst stage in a satellite’s
airborne  life  may  cost  several  million  dollars.  The  cost  for  launching  is  primarily  a  function  of  the  satellite’s
weight and size. Traditional geosynchronous communications satellites tend to be large and more costly to launch,
although the more compact digital communications payloads and longer satellite life will reduce life cycle costs.
Low  earth  orbit  communications  satellites  tend  to  be  smaller  and  more  economical  to  launch,  but  will  have
shorter in orbit life.
