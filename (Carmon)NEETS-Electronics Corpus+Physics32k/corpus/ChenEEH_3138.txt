It is interesting to note that even though extensive research
on higher voltages such as 1500 kV was performed in the 1970s
in the United States, Canada, and Russia, there are no com-
mercial lines operating at such voltages simply because of the
exorbitant cost of equipment required. The electric stress oc-
curring on the insulation varies nonlinearily with the voltage;
hence, design requirements at such high voltages are not a
simple extrapolation of the values used at lower voltages.
