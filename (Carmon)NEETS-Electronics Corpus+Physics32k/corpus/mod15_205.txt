To zero a synchro by the electrical lock method, deenergize the unit, connect the leads as shown in 
figure 1-41, and apply power. The synchro rotor will then quickly snap to the electrical zero position and 
lock. If the indicating device connected to the synchro shaft does not point to zero, loosen the synchro in 
its mounting and rotate it until the zero position of the indicator corresponds with the electrical zero of the 
synchro. As we stated previously, you may use 115 volts as the power source instead of 78 volts, 
provided you do not leave the unit connected for more than 2 minutes.
