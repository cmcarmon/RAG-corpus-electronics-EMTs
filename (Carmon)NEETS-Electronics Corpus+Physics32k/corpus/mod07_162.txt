There are many types of diodes varying in size from the size of a pinhead (used in subminiature
circuitry) to large 250-ampere diodes (used in high-power circuits). Because there are so many different
types of diodes, some system of identification is needed to distinguish one diode from another. This is
accomplished with the semiconductor identification system shown in figure 1-25. This system is not only
used for diodes but transistors and many other special semiconductor devices as well. As illustrated in this
figure, the system uses numbers and letters to identify different types of semiconductor devices. The first
number in the system indicates the number of junctions in the semiconductor device and is a number, one
less than the number of active elements. Thus 1 designates a diode; 2 designates a transistor (which may
be considered as made up of two diodes); and 3 designates a tetrode (a four-element transistor). The letter
"N" following the first number indicates a semiconductor. The 2- or 3-digit number following the letter
"N" is a serialized identification number. If needed, this number may contain a suffix letter after the last
digit. For example, the suffix letter "M" may be used to describe matching pairs of separate
semiconductor devices or the letter "R" may be used to indicate reverse polarity. Other letters are used to
indicate modified versions of the device which can be substituted for the basic numbered unit. For
example, a semiconductor diode designated as type 1N345A signifies a two-element diode (1) of
semiconductor material (N) that is an improved version (A) of type 345.
