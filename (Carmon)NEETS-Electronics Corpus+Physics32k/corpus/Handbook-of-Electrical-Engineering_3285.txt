Arc Lamp
A gas can be heated to temperatures of 6000 K or more by generating an electric arc between two electrodes.
The actual resulting temperature is dependent on the current ﬂowing through the arc, the gas pressure and its
composition, and other factors. This does provide a light source which is close to the temperature of the sun.
Using an inert xenon gas results in essentially a white light spectrum. The use of a gas such as mercury gives
more light in the UV as well as a number of strong peak light intensities at certain wavelengths. This is due to
excitation and ﬂuorescence of the mercury atoms.
