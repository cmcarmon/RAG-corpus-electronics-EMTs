Temporal redundancy is removed by using the differences
between successive images. For static parts of the image se-
quence, temporal differences will be close to zero and, hence,
are not coded. Those parts that change between frames, either
due to illumination variation or motion of objects, result in
signiﬁcant image error that needs to be coded. Image changes
due to motion can be signiﬁcantly reduced if the motion of the
object can be estimated and the difference can be taken on a
motion-compensated image. To carry out motion compen-
sation, the amount and direction of moving objects has to be
estimated ﬁrst. This is called motion estimation. The com-
monly used motion estimation technique in all the standard
video codecs is the block matching algorithm (BMA). In a
typical BMA, a frame is divided into square blocks of N 2
pixels. Then, for a maximum motion displacement of w pixels
per frame, the current block of pixels is matched against a
corresponding block at the same coordinates but in a previous
frame in the square window of width N þ 2w. The best match
on the basis of a matching criterion yields the displacement.
Various measures such as cross correlation function (CCF),
mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE)
can be used in the matching criteria. In practical coders, MSE
and MAE are more often used since it is believed that CCF
does not give good motion tracking, especially when the dis-
placement is not quite large. MSE and MAE are deﬁned as:
