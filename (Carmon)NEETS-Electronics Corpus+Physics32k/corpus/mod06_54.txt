The diode vacuum tube we are about to study is really Edisonâ€™s old incandescent bulb with the plate
in it. Diode means two elements or two electrodes, and refers to the two parts within the glass container
that make up the tube. We have called them filament and plate. More formally, they are called
CATHODE and PLATE, respectively. Sometimes the filament is called a HEATER, for obvious
reasons-more on this later.
