With this principle in mind, if you could design a circuit that had maximum impedance at a specific
frequency (or band of frequencies), that circuit could be used in an rf amplifier. This FREQUENCY-
DETERMINING NETWORK could be used as the input-signal-developing impedance, the output
impedance, or both. The rf amplifier circuit would then be as shown in figure 2-12.
