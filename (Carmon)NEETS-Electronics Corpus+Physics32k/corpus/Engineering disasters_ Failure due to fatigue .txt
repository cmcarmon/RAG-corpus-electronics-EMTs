When a material undergoes permanent deformation from exposure to radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired. This timeâ€“dependent plastic distortion of material is known as creep. Stress and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be much less than the strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.
In mechanical design, most failures are due to time-varying, or dynamic, loads that are applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure. Fatigue is known as the weakness in a material due to variations of stress that are repeatedly applied to said material. For example, when stretching a rubber band to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the rubber band) the rubber band will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the rubber band with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the rubber band being snapped. The same principle is applied to mechanical materials such as metals.
Fatigue failure always begins at a crack that may form over time or due to the manufacturing process used. The three stages of fatigue failure are:
1.) Crack initiation- when repeated stress creates a fracture in the material being used
2.) Crack propagation- when the initiated crack develops in the material to a larger scale due to tensile stress.
3.) Sudden fracture failure- caused by unstable crack growth to the point where the material will fail
Note that fatigue does not imply that the strength of the material is lessened after failure. This notion was originally referred to a material becoming "tired" after cyclic loading.
