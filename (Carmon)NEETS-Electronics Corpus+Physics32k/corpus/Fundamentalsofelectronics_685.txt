Because of the Sampling Theorem, we can process, in particular ﬁlter, analog signals “with a computer” by
constructing the system shown in Figure 5.24. To use this system, we are assuming that the input signal has
a lowpass spectrum and can be bandlimited without aﬀecting important signal aspects. Bandpass signals
can also be ﬁltered digitally, but require a more complicated system. Highpass signals cannot be ﬁltered
digitally. Note that the input and output ﬁlters must be analog ﬁlters; trying to operate without them can
lead to potentially very inaccurate digitization.
