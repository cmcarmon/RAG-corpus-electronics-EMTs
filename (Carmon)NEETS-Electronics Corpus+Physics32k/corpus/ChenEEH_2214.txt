In this equation, the vector Yr (and therefore &r and r 2) is
measured from the particular elementary charge being inte-
grated, dq, to the observation point. Equation 2.9 can be
proven as a consequence of Poisson’s theorem for the ﬁeld
vector D in an inﬁnite homogeneous space. Denoting the
charge distribution by r(x0, y0, z0) and the differential volume
element by dv0, equation 2.9 is rewritten in the more common
form:
