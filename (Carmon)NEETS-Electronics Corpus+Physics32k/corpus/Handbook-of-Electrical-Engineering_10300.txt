The  launch  of  a  satellite  payload  into  the  geosynchronous  orbit  involves  many  complex  steps.  Using  the
launch  vehicle,  the  payload  is  ﬁrst  placed  in  a  parking  orbit.  This  is  a  nearly  circular  orbit  which  places  the
satellite approximately 300 km above the earth’s surface. After reaching this orbit, the next step is to ﬁre a motor
known as the payload assist module (PAM) to place the payload in a transfer orbit. The PAM motor is discarded
afterwards. The transfer orbit is an elliptical orbit whose perigee matches the parking orbit and whose apogee
matches the geostationary orbit. Perigee is deﬁned as the point in the orbit closest to the earth, while apogee
is the point in the orbit furthest from the earth. The payload itself consists of the satellite with an apogee kick
motor (AKM). Once in a transfer orbit, the AKM is ﬁred at the point when the satellite has reached apogee.
This ﬁring will place the satellite in a nearly circular orbit. Final positioning of the satellite in geosynchronous
orbit can then take place [Pritchard and Sciulli, 1986].
