”Relative” permittivity means the permittivity of a material, relative to that of a pure vac-
uum. The greater the number, the greater the permittivity of the material. Glass, for instance,
with a relative permittivity of 7, has seven times the permittivity of a pure vacuum, and conse-
quently will allow for the establishment of an electric ﬁeld ﬂux seven times stronger than that
of a vacuum, all other factors being equal.
