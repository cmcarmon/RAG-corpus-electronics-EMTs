It is estimated that the CarTube will cost a fraction of conventional mass transport systems, due to the proposed infrastructure of the network, as well as the size of the tunnels. The CarTube tunnel diameter would be similar to the early tube diameter - a fraction of typical tunnels today. This is due to the fact that there is only need for ventilation for people, since the cars will be electric and have no emissions. Additionally, CarTube stations would be more compact than conventional stations as there are no escalators, pedestrian tunnels, staff and, crucially, no interchange system since the cars always travel directly to the requested destination.
