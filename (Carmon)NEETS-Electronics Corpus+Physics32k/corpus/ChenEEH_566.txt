Example 7.3. A Schottky diode is designed with the
same drift region parameters indicated in example 7.1.
The Schottky contact has a barrier height of 0.8 eV.
Conduction in a Schottky diode takes place by majority
carriers. Forward voltage drop of the diode is obtained
from equations 7.8 and 7.9 as:
