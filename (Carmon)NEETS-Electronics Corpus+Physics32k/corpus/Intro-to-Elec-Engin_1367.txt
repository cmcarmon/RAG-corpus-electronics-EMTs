(e) Now consider a tuned circuit in which R is
connected in series with a parallel combi-
√
nation of L and C, and the output voltage
is taken across R. With ω0 = 1/
LC and
Q = R
C/L, show that the circuit can
perform as a notch ﬁlter.
(f) For the purpose of rejecting 60-Hz interfer-
ence, in order to get fl = 58 Hz and fu = 62
Hz, ﬁnd the values of L and C of the circuit
in part (e) with R = 1 k.
14.3.5 A noisy ampliﬁer has Nout = 600 µW when T =
T0; but Nout drops to 480 µW when the source is
immersed in liquid nitrogen at T = 80 K. Find
the ampliﬁer’s noise temperature Ta.
