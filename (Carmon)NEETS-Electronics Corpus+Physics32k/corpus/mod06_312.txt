In view B, a bias voltage of -6 volts is applied to the grid. As you can see, some of the electrostatic
lines of force are attracted to the negatively charged grid wires while the rest pass through the grid
spacings. Because there are fewer lines of force reaching the cathode, there are fewer paths for electrons
to use to reach the plate. As a result, conduction through the tube is decreased.
