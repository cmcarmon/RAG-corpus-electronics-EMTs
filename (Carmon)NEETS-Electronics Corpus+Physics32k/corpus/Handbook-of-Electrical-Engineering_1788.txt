The second category obtains a displacement estimate at each pixel in a frame. These techniques are referred
to  as  pel  recursive  methods.  They  tend  to  provide  more  accurate  estimates  of  the  displacement  but  at  the
expense of higher complexity. Both categories of techniques have been applied to video data; however, block
matching is used more often in real systems. The primary reason is that more efÔ¨Åcient implementations have
been feasible. It should be noted, however, that every pixel in a block will be assigned the same displacement
estimate. Thus, the larger the block size the greater the potential for errors in the displacement estimate for a
given pixel. More details can be found in Musmann et al. [1985].
