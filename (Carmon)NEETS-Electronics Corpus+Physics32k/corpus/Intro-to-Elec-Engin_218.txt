where XL = ωL is the inductive reactance, XC = −1/ωC is the capacitive reactance, BL =
−1/ωL is the inductive susceptance, and BC = ωC is the capacitive susceptance. (Notice that
the fact 1/j = −j has been used.)
The general impedance and admittance functions with s = j ω for sinusoidal excitation are
