The MOSFET shown in Figure 32-8 has an N chan-
nel. The drain is always made positive with respect to 
the source, as in the JFET. The majority carriers are 
electrons in the N channel, which allow drain current 
(ID) to flow from the source to the drain. As with the 
JFET, the drain current is controlled by the gate-to-
source bias voltage (EGS). When the source voltage is 
0, a substantial drain current flows through the device 
because a large number of majority carriers (electrons) 
are present in the channel. When the gate is made 
negative with respect to the source, the drain current 
decreases as the majority carriers are depleted. If the 
negative gate voltage is increased sufficiently, the drain 
current drops to 0. One difference between MOSFETs 
and JFETs is that the gate of the N-channel depletion 
MOSFET can also be made positive with respect to 
the source. This cannot be done with a JFET because it 
would cause the gate and channel Pâ€“N junction to be 
forward biased.
