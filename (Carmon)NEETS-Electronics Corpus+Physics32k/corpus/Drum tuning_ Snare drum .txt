The thin, sensitive bottom (resonant) head is generally tuned much more tightly than the batter head.
The resonant head on a snare drum is often tuned up toward 398 Hz, depending on your overall tuning, but going much higher you risk damaging the head and/or the drum.
Treatment or muffling may be applied to any type of drum head to control overtones.
