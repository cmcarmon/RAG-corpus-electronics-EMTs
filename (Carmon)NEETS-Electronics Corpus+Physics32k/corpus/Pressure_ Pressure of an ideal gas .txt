In an ideal gas, molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the ideal gas law, pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and inversely with volume:




p
=



n
R
T

V


,


{\displaystyle p={\frac {nRT}{V}},}

where:
p is the absolute pressure of the gas,
n is the amount of substance,
T is the absolute temperature,
V is the volume,
R is the ideal gas constant.
Real gases exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.
