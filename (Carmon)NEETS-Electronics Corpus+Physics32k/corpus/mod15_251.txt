REVERSED ROTOR CONNECTIONS are common problems in new or modified synchro 
systems and should not be confused with the deliberate reversal of the stator connections. The reversal of 
the R1 and R2 connections on a synchro rotor causes a 180ยบ error between the synchro transmitter and the 
synchro receiver, but the direction of rotor rotation still remains the same.
