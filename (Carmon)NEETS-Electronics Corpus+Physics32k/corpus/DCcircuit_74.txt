When the electrons are poised in that static condition (just like water sitting still, high in a
reservoir), the energy stored there is called potential energy, because it has the possibility (po-
tential) of release that has not been fully realized yet. When you scuff your rubber-soled shoes
against a fabric carpet on a dry day, you create an imbalance of electric charge between your-
self and the carpet. The action of scufﬁng your feet stores energy in the form of an imbalance of
electrons forced from their original locations. This charge (static electricity) is stationary, and
you won’t realize that energy is being stored at all. However, once you place your hand against
a metal doorknob (with lots of electron mobility to neutralize your electric charge), that stored
energy will be released in the form of a sudden ﬂow of electrons through your hand, and you
will perceive it as an electric shock!
