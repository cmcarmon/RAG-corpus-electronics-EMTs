In Chapter 9, we saw that the voltage across a capacitor is continuous unless
the current through it contains an impulse. We also saw that the current through
an inductor is continuous unless the voltage across it contains an impulse. Since
vIN contains no impulses, we can therefore assume that both vC and iL are
continuous across the step at t = 0. Consequently, since both states are zero
for t ≤ 0, Equations 12.133 and 12.134 must both evaluate to zero as t → 0.
This observation allows us to use the initial conditions to determine A1 and
A2. Evaluation of both equations as t → 0, followed by the substitution of the
initial conditions, yields
