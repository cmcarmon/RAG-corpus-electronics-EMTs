Figure 10.92a illustrates an inverter INV1 driving another
inverter INV2. The corresponding equivalent circuit for the inverter pair is illustrated
in Figure 10.92b. A, B, and C represent logical values, and vA, vB, and vC represent
voltage levels. The equivalent circuit model for an inverter based on the SRC model of
the MOSFET is depicted in Figure 10.93.
