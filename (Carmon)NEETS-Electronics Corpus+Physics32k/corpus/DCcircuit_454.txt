This brings us to the second principle of series circuits: the total resistance of any series
circuit is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. This should make intuitive sense: the
more resistors in series that the electrons must ﬂow through, the more difﬁcult it will be for
those electrons to ﬂow. In the example problem, we had a 3 kΩ, 10 kΩ, and 5 kΩ resistor in
series, giving us a total resistance of 18 kΩ:
