For example, the input port of the dependent source marked with the
branch variables vIN and iIN in Figure 2.65 is an open circuit. Accordingly,
iIN = 0 and vIN = vI, the voltage across the resistor RI. Therefore, we can
equivalently use the circuit in Figure 2.68, where the input port of the dependent
source is not shown explicitly, and the current sourced by the dependent source
is specified directly in terms of vI, the voltage across the resistor RI. We have
thus eliminated the branch variables vIN and iIN from our analysis.
