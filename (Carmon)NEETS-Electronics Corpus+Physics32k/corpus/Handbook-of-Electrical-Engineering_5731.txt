With reference to monitoring of individual frequencies, the maximum recommended relative errors for the
, respectively, under normal operating conditions and with constant voltage
magnitude and phase are 5% and 5
o
or current levels. However, such precision must be maintained for voltage variations of up to 20% (of nominal
value) and 100% (peak value). For current measurements, the precision levels apply for overcurrents of up to
20% and peaks of 3 times rms value (on steady state) and 10 times the nominal current for a 1-sec duration.
Errors  in  the  frequency  response  of  current  transformers  occur  due  to  capacitive  effects,  which  are  not
signiÔ¨Åcant in the harmonic region (say, up to the 50th harmonic), and also due to magnetizing currents. The
