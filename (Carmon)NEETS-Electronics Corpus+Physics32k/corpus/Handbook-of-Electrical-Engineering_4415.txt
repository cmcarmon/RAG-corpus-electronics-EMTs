Proof testing not only guarantees that the ﬁber will survive short-term stresses but also guarantees that the
ﬁber will survive a lower residual stress that it may be subjected to during its long service life. It is well known
that glass, when used in a humid environment, can fail under a long-term stress well below its instantaneous
strength. This phenomenon is called static fatigue. Several models have been proposed to quantitatively describe
the relationship between residual stress and the life of optical ﬁbers. Use is made of the most conservative of
these models, and the proof stress is determined by a consideration of the maximum possible residual stress
in service and the required service life.
