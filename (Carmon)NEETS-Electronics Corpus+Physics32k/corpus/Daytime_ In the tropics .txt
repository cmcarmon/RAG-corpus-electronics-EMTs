The tropics occupy a zone of Earth's surface between 23.5° north and 23.5° south of the Equator. Within this zone, the Sun will pass (or culminate) almost directly overhead on at least one day per year. The line of 23.5° north latitude is called the Tropic of Cancer, because when it was named, the Sun passed overhead at this location at the time of year when it was within the zodiac sign of Cancer. The equivalent line of south latitude is called the Tropic of Capricorn, for similar reasons. If they had been named today using the constellation in which the sun is currently in at the time it is directly overhead the tropic line, they would have been called, respectively, the Tropics of Gemini and Sagittarius. The sun enters and leaves each sign of the zodiac slightly later each year at the rate of about 1 day every 72 years. For more information, see precession of the equinoxes.
On the Tropical Circles, the Sun is directly overhead only once per year, on the corresponding solstice. At latitudes closer to the Equator and on the Equator itself, it will be overhead twice per year (on the equinoxes in the case of the Equator). Outside the tropics, the Sun never passes directly overhead.
