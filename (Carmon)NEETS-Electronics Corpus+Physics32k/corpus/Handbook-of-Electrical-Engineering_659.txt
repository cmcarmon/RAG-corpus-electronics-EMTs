Low-Pass Equivalent of FM-DCSK System
The block diagram of  a general chaotic communications system is given in Fig. 5.23. As shown in Fig. 5.34,
the demodulator of an FM-DCSK system is a correlator, and the observation signal zi is the correlator output
sampled at the decision time instants. To derive the low-pass equivalent model of a chaotic communications
scheme,  the  relationship  between  the  analog  input  and  output  signals  must  be  found;  that  is,  the  correlator
output z(t) must be determined for a given analog input signal.
