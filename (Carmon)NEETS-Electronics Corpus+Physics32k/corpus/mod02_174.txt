If the switch is now opened as shown in figure 3-8(A), the electrons on the upper plate are isolated.
The electrons on the top plate are attracted to the charged bottom plate. Because the dielectric is an
insulator, the electrons can not cross the dielectric to the bottom plate. The charges on both plates will be
effectively trapped by the electrostatic field and the capacitor will remain charged indefinitely. You should
note at this point that the insulating dielectric material in a practical capacitor is not perfect and small
leakage current will flow through the dielectric. This current will eventually dissipate the charge. However,
a high quality capacitor may hold its charge for a month or more.
