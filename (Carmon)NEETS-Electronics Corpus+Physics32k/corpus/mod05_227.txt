Alternators are rated according to the voltage they are designed to produce and the maximum current
they are capable of providing. The maximum current that can be supplied by an alternator depends upon
the maximum heating loss that can be sustained in the armature. This heating loss (which is an I2R power
loss) acts to heat the conductors, and if excessive, destroys the insulation. Thus, alternators are rated in
terms of this current and in terms of the voltage output â€” the alternator rating in small units is in volt-
amperes; in large units it is kilovolt-amperes.
