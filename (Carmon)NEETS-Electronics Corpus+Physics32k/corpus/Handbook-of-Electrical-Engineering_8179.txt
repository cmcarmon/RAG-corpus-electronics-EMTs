Raster: Also called television raster; it is developed by a moving spot of light generated by an electron beam
scanning a CRT phosphor screen in a predetermined and repetitive pattern. A picture is generated by
modulating the beam intensity, hence the spot light output, when scanning the screen surface. Usually,
horizontal lines are generated scanning in a left-to-right sequence and developed top-to-bottom of the
image surface.
