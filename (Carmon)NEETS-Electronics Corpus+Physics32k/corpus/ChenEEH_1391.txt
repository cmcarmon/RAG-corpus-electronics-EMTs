FIGURE 3.2 Overlapping Computation and Reconﬁguration. Given the pipeline F with stages f1, . . . , f5 and the pipeline G with stages
g1, . . . , g5, the diagram shows how F can be reconﬁgured into G in ﬁve steps. Only one stage of the pipeline is being reconﬁgured in each step,
while the rest of the pipeline continues to operate.
