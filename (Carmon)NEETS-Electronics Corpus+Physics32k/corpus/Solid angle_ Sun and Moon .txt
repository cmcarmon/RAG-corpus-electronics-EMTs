The Sun is seen from Earth at an average angular diameter of about 9.35×10−3 radians. The Moon is seen from Earth at an average diameter of 9.22×10−3 radians. We can substitute these into the equation given above for the solid angle subtended by a cone with apex angle 2θ:

The resulting value for the Sun is 6.87×10−5 steradians. The resulting value for the Moon is 6.67×10−5 steradians. In terms of the total celestial sphere, the Sun and the Moon subtend fractional areas of 0.000546% (Sun) and 0.000531% (Moon). On average, the Sun is larger in the sky than the Moon even though it is much, much farther away.
