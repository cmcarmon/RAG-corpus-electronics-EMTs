As you can see from the calculations, by doubling the frequency of the rectifier, you reduce the 
impedance of the capacitor by one-half. This allows the ac component to pass through the capacitor more 
easily. As a result, a full-wave rectifier output is much easier to filter than that of a half-wave rectifier. 
Remember, the smaller the XC of the filter capacitor with respect to the load resistance, the better the 
filtering action. Since
