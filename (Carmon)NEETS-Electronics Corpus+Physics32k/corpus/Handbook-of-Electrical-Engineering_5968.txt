One design of stepping motors, based on the doubly salient switched reluctance motor, uses a large number
of teeth in the rotor (typically 45) to create saliency, as shown in Fig. 66.27. In this design, when the rotor teeth
are aligned in say Phase 1, they are misaligned in Phases 2 and 3. A pulse of current in Phase 2 will cause a
rotation so that the alignment will occur at Phase 2. If, instead, a pulse to Phase 3 is given, the rotor will move
the same distance in the opposite rotation.
