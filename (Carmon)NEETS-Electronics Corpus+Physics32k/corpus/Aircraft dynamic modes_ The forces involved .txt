Say the roll is to the right. A sideslip develops, resulting in a slip-flow which is right-to-left. Now examine the resulting forces one at a time, calling any rightward influence yaw-in, leftward yaw-out, or roll-in or -out, whichever applies. The slip-flow will:
push the fin, rudder, and other side areas aft of c.g. to the left, causing a right yaw-in,
push side areas ahead of the c.g. to the left, causing a left yaw-out,
push the right wingtip up, the left down, a left roll-out owing to the dihedral angle,
cause the left wing to go faster, the right wing slower, a roll-in,
push the side areas of the aircraft above the c.g. to the left, a roll-out,
push the side areas of the aircraft below the c.g. to the left, a roll-in,
Also, an aerodynamic force is imposed by the relative vertical positions of the fuselage and the wings, creating a roll-in leverage if the fuselage is above the wings, as in a low wing configuration; or roll-out if below, as in a high-wing configuration.
A propeller rotating under power will influence the airflow passing it. Its effect depends on throttle setting (high at high rpm, low at low) and the attitude of the aircraft.
Thus, a spiral dive results from the netting-out of many forces depending partly on the design of the aircraft, partly on its attitude, and partly on its throttle setting (a susceptible design will spiral dive under power but may not in the glide).
