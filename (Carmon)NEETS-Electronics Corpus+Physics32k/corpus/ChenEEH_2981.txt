Note that maximum gain occurs when both the input and
output provide

). Moreover, the ampliﬁer must be operated in a stable
conﬁguration to ensure that it will not oscillate. Oscillation may
occur if the input or output port impedance has a negative real
part, leading to jGinj or jGoutj greater than the value of 1. Since
Gin and Gout rely on GL and GS, stability can be ensured by
proper matching conditions with possibly reduced gain. Two
types of stability are typically deﬁned: unconditionally stable
and conditionally stable. An unconditionally stable network
must have both jGinj < 1 and jGoutj < 1 for all passive source
and load terminations. A conditionally stable network will have
both jGinj < 1 and jGoutj < 1 for a range of passive source and
load terminations. Note that in a unilateral device, it is sufﬁcient
that jS11j < 1 and jS22j < 1 for the device to be unconditionally
stable. In addition, the maximum stable gain of a transistor
is GMSG ¼ jS21j=jS12j. This is an important parameter when
choosing a transistor. A convenient way of expressing the neces-
sary and sufﬁcient conditions for unconditional stability in
terms of the S-parameters is through these equations:
