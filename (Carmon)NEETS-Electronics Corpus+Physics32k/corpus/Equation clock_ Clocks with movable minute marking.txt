Clocks have been constructed in which the minute markings are on a circular plate that can be turned around the same axis as the hands. The axis passes through a hole in the centre of the plate, and the hands are in front of the plate. The minutes part of the time shown by the clock is given by the position of the minute hand relative to the markings on the plate. The hand is driven clockwise at constant speed by the clock mechanism, and the plate is turned by the mechanism that simulates the equation of time, rotating anticlockwise as the equation of time increases, and clockwise when it decreases. If the gear ratios are correct, the clock shows solar time. Mean time can also be shown by a separate, stationary set of minute markings on the dial, outside the edge of the plate. The hour display is not adjusted for the equation of time, so the hour reading is slightly approximate. This has no practical effect, since it is always easy to see which hour is correct. These clocks are mechanically simpler than the other types described below, but they have disadvantages: Solar time is difficult to read without looking closely at the minute markings, and the clock cannot be made to strike the hour in solar time.
