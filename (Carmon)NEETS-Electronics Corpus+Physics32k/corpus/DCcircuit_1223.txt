There is some debate over exactly how and why superconducting materials superconduct.
One theory holds that electrons group together and travel in pairs (called Cooper pairs) within
a superconductor rather than travel independently, and that has something to do with their
frictionless ﬂow. Interestingly enough, another phenomenon of super-cold temperatures, super-
ﬂuidity, happens with certain liquids (especially liquid helium), resulting in frictionless ﬂow of
molecules.
