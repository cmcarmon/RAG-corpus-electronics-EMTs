Some equations, typically results from a derivation, include useful quantities which serve as a one-off definition within its scope of application.
Examples
In special relativity, relativistic mass has support and detraction by physicists. It is defined as:




m
=
γ

m

0






{\displaystyle m=\gamma m_{0}\,\!}

where m0 is the rest mass of the object and γ is the Lorentz factor. This makes some quantities such as momentum p and energy E of a massive object in motion easy to obtain from other equations simply by using relativistic mass:





p

=
m

v

→

p

=
γ

m

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} \rightarrow \mathbf {p} =\gamma m_{0}\mathbf {v} }





E
=
m

c

2


→
E
=
γ

m

0



c

2




{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}\rightarrow E=\gamma m_{0}c^{2}}

However, this does not always apply, for instance the kinetic energy T and force F of the same object is not given by:




T

{\displaystyle T={\frac {m}{2}}\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} \nrightarrow T={\frac {\gamma m_{0}}{2}}\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} }

m

F

γ

a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} \nrightarrow \mathbf {F} =\gamma m_{0}\mathbf {a} }

The Lorentz factor has a deeper significance and origin, and is used in terms of proper time and coordinate time with four-vectors. The correct equations above are consequence of the applying definitions in the correct order.

In electromagnetism, a charged particle (of mass m and charge q) in a uniform magnetic field B is deflected by the field in a circular helical arc at velocity v and radius of curvature r, where the helical trajectory inclined at an angle θ to B. The magnetic force is the centripetal force, so the force F acting on the particle is;

serves as the definition for the magnetic rigidity of the particle. Since this depends on the mass and charge of the particle, it is useful for determining the extent a particle deflects in a B field, which occurs experimentally in mass spectrometry and particle detectors.
