In older cars, the trunnion is part of the suspension and either allows free movement of the rear wheel hub in relation to the chassis or allows the front wheel hub to rotate with the steering. On many cars (such as those made by the Triumph) the trunnion is machined from a brass or bronze casting and is prone to failure if not greased properly. American Motors recommended lubrication of its pre-packed front suspension trunnions using a sodium base grease every 32,000 miles (51,000 km) or three years. It later incorporated molded rubber "Clevebloc" bushings on the upper trunnion to seal out dirt and retain silicone lubricant for the life of the car.
In aviation, the term refers to the structural component that attaches the undercarriage or landing gear to the airframe. For aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear, the trunnion is pivoted to permit rotation of the entire gear assembly.
In heavy equipment, such as a bulldozer, the term refers to the protrusions on the vehicle frame on which the blade frame attaches and hinges allowing vertical movement.
In Chevrolet GMC C/K pickup trucks, the term refers to the tailgate attachment points. Rather than using conventional tailgate hinges, trunnions are used to permit quick toolless removal and installation of the pickup tailgate.
In axles, the term refers to the type of suspension used on a multi-axle configurations. It is a "short axle pivoted at or near its mid-point about a horizontal axis transverse to its own centerline, normally used in pairs in conjunction with a walking beam in order to achieve two axis of oscillation." This type of suspension allows 60,000 pounds (27,000 kg) to be loaded on an axle group.
In trailers, leveling jacks may have trunnion mounts.
In the valve train of a pushrod engine, the term refers to the fixed axle that acts as a pivot point for the valve rocker.
