For a single-inputâ€“single-output linear system there are no theoretical advantages whatever to any minor-
loop  compensation  to  series  compensation  as  the  same  closed-loop  transfer  function  can  be  realized  by  all
procedures. However, when there are multiple inputs or outputs, then there may be considerable advantages
to minor-loop design as contrasted to series compensation design. Multiple inputs often occur when there is
a single-signal input and one or more noise or disturbance inputs present and a task of the system is to pass
the signal inputs and reject the noise inputs. Also there may be saturation-type nonlinearities present, and we
may be concerned not only with the primary system output but also with keeping the output at the saturation
point within bounds such that the system remains linear. Thus there are reasons why minor-loop design may
be preferable to series equalization.
