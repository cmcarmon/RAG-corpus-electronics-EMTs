The instruments used in the seismic array are CUSP-3Clp accelerometers manufactured by Canterbury Seismic Instruments Ltd. based in New Zealand. The instruments record three components of ground motion, i.e. one vertical and two horizontal components, over a high dynamic range. The instruments are connected to a GPS clock, ensuring a uniform time over the network. The instruments communicate via a wireless permanent GPRS connection. This enables remote configuration of individual units and near real-time alerts and data uploading. An important feature that has been developed during the establishment of the array is a common triggering scheme. This feature was designed in collaboration with the manufacturers of the units. In the event of two or more units receiving an earthquake trigger, the common triggering feature activates the entire array to start recording. This scheme ensures complete data coverage and greatly reduces the need to filter out noise and manmade disturbances.
