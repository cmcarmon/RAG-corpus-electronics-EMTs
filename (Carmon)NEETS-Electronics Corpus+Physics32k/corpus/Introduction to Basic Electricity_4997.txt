With the exception of discrete logic gates and mul-
tiple op-amp packages, arrange the IC pins in physical 
order, as viewed from the top. Start with the IC that 
has the most pins, and then place the other parts that 
follow the simple schematic. The goal is to lay out a 
printed circuit board, with no crossed traces, that re-
sembles the physical relationship of the schematic dia-
gram, which becomes useful in troubleshooting.
