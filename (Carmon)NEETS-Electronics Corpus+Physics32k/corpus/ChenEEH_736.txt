The overall Pareto curve obviously combines both differently
optimized ‘‘sub-Pareto’’ results. For the high cycle budget and
low performance situations, the low energy implementation is
better. Only for a very high performance, the speed optimized
implementation should be used. This kind of trade-off was ﬁrst
discussed by Brockmeyer et al. (2000). We will now also show
how these curves can be effectively used to signiﬁcantly improve
the overall system design of data-dominated applications.
