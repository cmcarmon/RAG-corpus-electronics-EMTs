Pinches exist in laboratories and in nature. Pinches differ in their geometry and operating forces. These include:
Uncontrolled
Any time an electric current moves in large amounts (e.g., lightning, arcs, sparks, discharges) a magnetic force can pull together plasma. This can be insufficient for fusion.
Sheet pinch
An astrophysical effect, this arises from vast sheets of charge particles.
Z-pinch
The current runs down the axis (or walls) of the cylinder while the magnetic field is azimuthal
Theta pinch
The magnetic field runs down the axis of the cylinder, while the electric field is in the azimuthal direction (also called a thetatron)
Screw pinch
A combination of a Z-pinch and theta pinch  (also called a stabilized Z-pinch, or Î¸-Z pinch)
Reversed field pinch
This is an attempt to do a Z-pinch inside an endless loop. The plasma has an internal magnetic field. As you move out from the center of this ring, the magnetic field reverses direction. Also called a toroidal pinch.
Inverse pinch
An early fusion concept, this device consisted of a rod surrounded by plasma. Current traveled through the plasma and returned along the center rod. This geometry was slightly different than a z-pinch in that the conductor was in the center, not the sides.
Cylindrical pinch
Orthogonal pinch effect
Ware pinch
A pinch that happens inside Tokamaks. This is when particles inside the Banana orbit condense together.
MAGLIF
This is a combination of a Z-pinch and a laser beam to stop loss of material at the end.
