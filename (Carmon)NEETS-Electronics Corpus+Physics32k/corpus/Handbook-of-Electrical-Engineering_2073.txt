Technical Overview
In underwater acoustics, a number of units are used: distances of nautical miles (1852 m), yards (0.9144 m)
and kiloyards; speeds of knots (nautical mile/h); depths of fathoms (6 ft or 1.8288 m); and bearing of degrees
(0.01745 rad). However, in the past two decades there has been a conscious effort to be totally metric, i.e., to
use MKS or Standard International units.
