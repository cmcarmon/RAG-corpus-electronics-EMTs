While this discussion is only concerned with five electrons, vertical scanning, or deflection, involves
millions of electrons in a continuous electron beam. Instead of seeing five spots on the CRT screen, you
will actually see a visual presentation of the sine wave input. This was, as you remember, described
earlier as the unique feature of the CRT. You may have wondered why so much space in this chapter was
taken up with the discussion of the CRT. There are two reasons for this. First, the field of electronics is in
a constant state of evolution. Transistors replaced most vacuum tubes. Transistors are being replaced by
integrated circuits (ICs). As you progress in your career in electronics, you will find that the equipment
you work on will follow this evolution, from transistors to IC chips. Of all the tubes discussed in this text,
the CRT is the least likely to be replaced in the near future. Thus, in all probability, whether your career
in electronics lasts for only the time you spend with this text or 20 years, the CRT will be your constant
companion and co-worker.
