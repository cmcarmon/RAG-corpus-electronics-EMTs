Complex waveforms are divided into two groups, PERIODIC WAVES and NONPERIODIC 
WAVES. Periodic waves contain the fundamental frequency and its related harmonics. Nonperiodic 
waves contain a continuous band of frequencies resulting from the repetition period of the fundamental 
frequency approaching infinity and thereby creating a continuous frequency spectrum.
