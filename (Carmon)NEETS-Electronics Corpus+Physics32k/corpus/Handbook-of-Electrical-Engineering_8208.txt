Current Limiting for Plasma Displays
To avoid a catastrophic arc, the current in a gas discharge must be limited by some means. There are a number
of ways of accomplishing this, but only two, shown in Fig. 83.27, have achieved commercial success. dc plasma
displays  use  a  resistor,  a  semiconductor  current  source,  or  a  short  applied  voltage  pulse  to  limit  the  current
and have the electrodes in intimate contact with the gas discharge. ac plasma displays limit the current with
an internal glass dielectric that couples the electrodes capacitively to the gas discharge.
