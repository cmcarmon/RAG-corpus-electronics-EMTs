As shown by previous research (Friedman, 1995, 1992;
Neves and Friedman, 1993, 1996a, 1996b; Xi and Dai, 1996;
Kourtev and Friedman, 1999b), both double and zero clocking
hazards may be removed from a synchronous digital circuit
even when the clock skew is not zero [TSkew (i, f ) 6¼ 0 for some
or all local data paths Ri?Rf ]. As long as equations 4.5 and
4.6 are satisﬁed, a synchronous digital system can operate
reliably with nonzero clock skews, permitting the system to
operate at higher clock frequencies while removing all race
conditions.
