A different mechanism for linear memory is the feedback (Fig. 20.11). Feedback allows the system to remem-
ber past events because of the exponential decay of the response. This memory has limited resolution because
of the low pass required for long memories. But notice that unlike the memory by delay, memory by feedback
provides  the  learning  system  with  a  free  parameter  m  that  controls  the  length  of  the  memory.  Memory  by
feedback has been used in Elman and Jordan networks [Haykin, 1994].
