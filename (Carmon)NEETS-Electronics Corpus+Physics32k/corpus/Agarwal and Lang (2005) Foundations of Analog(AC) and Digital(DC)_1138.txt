Small-signal operation requires that the total input signal appear as a small
perturbation about a DC offset. The input DC offset establishes an operating
point for the amplifier. Section 7.7 discussed the issue of operating points in the
context of large signals, and proposed a method for selecting the operating point
based on maximizing the dynamic input signal range. Specifically, Section 7.7
suggested that the operating point be chosen as the midpoint of the valid input
voltage range of amplifier operation under the saturation discipline. This made
