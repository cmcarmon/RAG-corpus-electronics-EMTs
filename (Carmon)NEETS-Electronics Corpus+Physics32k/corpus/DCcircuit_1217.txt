At 20o Celsius, we get 12.5 volts across the load and a total of 1.5 volts (0.75 + 0.75) dropped
across the wire resistance. If the temperature were to rise to 35o Celsius, we could easily
determine the change of resistance for each piece of wire. Assuming the use of copper wire (Î±
= 0.004041) we get:
