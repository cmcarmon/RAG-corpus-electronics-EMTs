As you know, the induced voltage in a conductor is proportional to the rate at which magnetic lines 
of force cut the conductor. The greater the rate (the higher the frequency), the greater the cemf. Also, the 
induced voltage increases with an increase in inductance; the more ampere-turns, the greater the cemf. 
Reactance, then, increases with an increase of frequency and with an increase of inductance. The formula 
for inductive reactance is as follows:
