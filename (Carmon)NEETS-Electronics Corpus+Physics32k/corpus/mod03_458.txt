Switches are used in the home to turn off the alarm clock, to control the stove, to turn on the
refrigerator light, to turn on and control radios and televisions, hair dryers, dishwashers, garbage
disposals, washers and dryers, as well as to control heating and air conditioning. A typical luxury
automobile with power seats and windows might have as many as 45 switches.
