An infrared cutoff (long-distance cutoff) is the minimal value of energy – or, equivalently, the maximal wavelength (usually a very large distance) – that will be taken into account in a calculation, typically an integral.
At the opposite end of the energy scale, an ultraviolet cutoff is the maximal allowed energy or the shortest allowed distance (usually a very short length scale).
