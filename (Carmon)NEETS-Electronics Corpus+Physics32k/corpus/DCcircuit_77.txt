Because of the difference in the height of the drop, there’s potential for much more energy
to be released from the reservoir through the piping to location 2 than to location 1. The
principle can be intuitively understood in dropping a rock: which results in a more violent
impact, a rock dropped from a height of one foot, or the same rock dropped from a height of
one mile? Obviously, the drop of greater height results in greater energy released (a more
violent impact). We cannot assess the amount of stored energy in a water reservoir simply by
measuring the volume of water any more than we can predict the severity of a falling rock’s
impact simply from knowing the weight of the rock: in both cases we must also consider how far
these masses will drop from their initial height. The amount of energy released by allowing
a mass to drop is relative to the distance between its starting and ending points. Likewise,
the potential energy available for moving electrons from one point to another is relative to
those two points. Therefore, voltage is always expressed as a quantity between two points.
Interestingly enough, the analogy of a mass potentially ”dropping” from one height to another
is such an apt model that voltage between two points is sometimes called a voltage drop.
