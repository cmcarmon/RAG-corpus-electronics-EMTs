Junction Photodiodes
In a simple junction photodiode a pn junction is fabricated in a semiconductor material. Figure 31.10 shows
the energy diagram of such a device with a reverse voltage bias applied. Incident light with energy greater than
the bandgap creates electrons in the p region and holes in the n region. Those which are within the diffusion
length of the junction are swept across by the ﬁeld. The light also creates electron–hole pairs in the junction
region,  and  these  are  separated  by  the  ﬁeld.  In  both  cases  an  electron  charge  is  contributed  to  the  external
circuit. In the case of no bias the carrier movement creates a voltage with p region being positive. The maximum
voltage is equal to the difference in the Fermi levels in the p and n regions and approaches the bandgap energy Eg.
