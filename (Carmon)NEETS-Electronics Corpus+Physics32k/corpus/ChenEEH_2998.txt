Speciﬁc issues with mixer design include matching for opti-
mal performance, isolation, and rejection of image frequencies
that can cause spurious responses near the desired intermedi-
ate frequency. A block diagram of a typical down-conversion
mixer is shown in Figure 11.13. With applied RF and LO
signals, the frequencies fRF  fLO are present at the output of
the mixer. Note that in practice, all mixing products will be
present at the output. Then a low-pass ﬁlter is used to elimi-
nate all but the desired intermediate frequency, fRF  fLO, for
improved isolation. In addition to isolation, conversion loss is
an important ﬁgure of merit for a mixer. In decibels, this is
given as:
