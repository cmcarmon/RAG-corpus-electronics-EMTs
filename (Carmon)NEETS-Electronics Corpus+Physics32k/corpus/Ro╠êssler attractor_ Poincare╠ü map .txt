The Poincaré map is constructed by plotting the value of the function every time it passes through a set plane in a specific direction. An example would be plotting the



y
,
z


{\displaystyle y,z}
value every time it passes through the



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}
plane where



x


{\displaystyle x}
is changing from negative to positive, commonly done when studying the Lorenz attractor. In the case of the Rössler attractor, the



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}
plane is uninteresting, as the map always crosses the



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}
plane at



z
=
0


{\displaystyle z=0}
due to the nature of the Rössler equations. In the



x
=
0.1


{\displaystyle x=0.1}
plane for



a
=
0.1


{\displaystyle a=0.1}
,



b
=
0.1


{\displaystyle b=0.1}
,



c
=
14


{\displaystyle c=14}
, the Poincaré map shows the upswing in



z


{\displaystyle z}
values as



x


{\displaystyle x}
increases, as is to be expected due to the upswing and twist section of the Rössler plot. The number of points in this specific Poincaré plot is infinite, but when a different



c


{\displaystyle c}
value is used, the number of points can vary. For example, with a



c


{\displaystyle c}
value of 4, there is only one point on the Poincaré map, because the function yields a periodic orbit of period one, or if the



c


{\displaystyle c}
value is set to 12.8, there would be six points corresponding to a period six orbit.
