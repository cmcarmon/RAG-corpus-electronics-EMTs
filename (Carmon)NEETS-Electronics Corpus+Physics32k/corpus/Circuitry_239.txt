Example 5.1 
 
The  characteristic  shown  in  Fig.  5.8  refers  to  a 
germanium  diode.  Determine  the  resistance  of  the 
diode when (a) the forward current is 2.5 mA and 
(b) when the forward voltage is 0.65 V. 
 
Solution 
 
(a)   When IF = 2.5 mA the corresponding value 
of  VF can  be  read  from  the  graph.  This 
 
shows  that  VF = 0.43  V.  The  resistance  of 
 
the  diode  at  this  point  on  the  characteristic 
 
will be given by:
