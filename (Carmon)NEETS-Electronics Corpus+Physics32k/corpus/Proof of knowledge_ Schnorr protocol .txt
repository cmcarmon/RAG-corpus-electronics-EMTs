One of the simplest and frequently used proofs of knowledge, the proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm, is due to Schnorr. The protocol is defined for a cyclic group




G

q




{\displaystyle G_{q}}
of order



q


{\displaystyle q}
with generator



g


{\displaystyle g}
.
In order to prove knowledge of



x
=

log

g


‚Å°
y


{\displaystyle x=\log _{g}y}
, the prover interacts with the verifier as follows:
In the first round the prover commits himself to randomness



r


{\displaystyle r}
; therefore the first message



t
=

g

r




{\displaystyle t=g^{r}}
is also called commitment.
The verifier replies with a challenge



c


{\displaystyle c}
chosen at random.
After receiving



c


{\displaystyle c}
, the prover sends the third and last message (the response)



s
=
r
+
c
x


{\displaystyle s=r+cx}
.
The verifier accepts, if




g

s


=
t

y

c




{\displaystyle g^{s}=ty^{c}}
.
