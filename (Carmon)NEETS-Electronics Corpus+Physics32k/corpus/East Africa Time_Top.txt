East Africa Time, or EAT, is a time zone used in eastern Africa. The zone is three hours ahead of UTC (UTC+3), which is the same as Arabia Standard Time, Further-eastern European Time, Moscow Time and Eastern European Summer Time.
As this Time Zone is predominantly in the equatorial region, there is no significant change in day length throughout the year and so daylight saving time is not observed.
East Africa Time is used by the following countries:
Comoros
Djibouti
Eritrea
Ethiopia
Kenya
Madagascar
Somalia
South Sudan
Tanzania
Uganda
