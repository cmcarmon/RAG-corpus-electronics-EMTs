The computers of the first generation (1951-1958) were physically very large machines characterized 
by the vacuum tube (fig. 1-6). Because they used vacuum tubes, they were very unreliable, required a lot 
of power to run, and produced so much heat that adequate air conditioning was critical to protect the 
computer parts. Compared to today's computers, they had slow input and output devices, were slow in 
processing, and had small storage capacities. Many of the internal processing functions were measured in 
thousandths of a second (millisecond). The software (computer program) used on first generation 
computers was unsophisticated and machine oriented. This meant that the programmers had to code all 
computer instructions and data in actual machine language. They also had to keep track of where 
instructions and data were stored in memory. Using such a machine language (see chapter 3) was efficient 
for the computer but difficult for the programmer.
