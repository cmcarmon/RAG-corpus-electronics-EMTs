where gm is the device transconductance (a measure of gain capability) and Cgs is the gate source capacitance.
High fT is desirable and this is achieved with highly doped channels and low capacitance gates. The RF power
gain is also of interest and this performance can be indicated by the unilateral power gain deﬁned as
