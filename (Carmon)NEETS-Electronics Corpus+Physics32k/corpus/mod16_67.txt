Some test and measuring equipment (T&ME) should be calibrated by you instead of your referring
the instrument to a calibration facility. For example, some instruments, such as hardness testers and
densitometers, are provided with their own standards and should be calibrated each time used, or at least
very frequently. Some instruments, such as oscillographic recorders, may require calibration before,
during, and after each use.
