The output dc voltage references on each of the amplifiers are independently adjustable. Therefore,
the beam will be deflected by different amounts on each channel if the voltage reference is different at
each amplifier output. The output voltage from each amplifier is applied to the deflection plates through
the gate. The gate is actually an electronic switch. In this application, it is commonly referred to as a
BEAM SWITCH.
