Any defects resulting from the etching process 
should be taken care of at this time. Types of defects 
include traces that are bridged or shorted together 
or traces that are open (Figure 48-22). Traces that are 
shorted together can be separated using a knife. Traces 
that are open need to be bridged with wire and solder.
