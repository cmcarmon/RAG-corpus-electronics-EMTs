A circuit-analysis program known as SPICE, an acronym for simulation program with
integrated circuit emphasis, is introduced in this section. The original SPICE program was
developed in the early 1970s at the University of California at Berkeley. Since that time, various
SPICE-based commercial products have been developed for personal computer and workstation
platforms.1
