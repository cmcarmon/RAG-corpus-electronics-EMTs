Again, the ﬁrst term denotes the power loss in the incident
wave, the second term denotes the power loss in the reﬂected
wave, and the third term represents power loss due to inter-
action between the two. As a increases, the power loss in the
incident and reﬂected waves as well as in the interaction term
increases. In the limiting case of a lossless line, there should not
be any dissipation. Clearly, the interaction term vanishes be-
cause u0 ¼ 0, and the power dissipation in the ﬁrst two terms
reduces to zero.
