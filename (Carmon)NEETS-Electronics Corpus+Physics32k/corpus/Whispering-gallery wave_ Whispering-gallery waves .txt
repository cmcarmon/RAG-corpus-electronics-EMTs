Whispering-gallery waves exist for light waves. They have been produced in microscopic glass spheres or toruses, for example, with applications in lasing, optomechanical cooling, frequency comb generation and sensing. The light waves are almost perfectly guided round by optical total internal reflection, leading to Q factors in excess of 1010 being achieved. This is far greater than the best values, about 104, that can be similarly obtained in acoustics. Optical modes in a whispering gallery resonator are inherently lossy due to a mechanism similar to quantum tunneling. As a result, light inside a whispering gallery mode experiences a degree of radiation loss even in theoretically ideal conditions. Such a loss channel has been known from research on optical waveguide theory and is dubbed tunneling ray attenuation in the field of fiber optics. The Q factor is proportional to the decay time of the waves, which in turn is inversely proportional to both the surface scattering rate and the wave absorption in the medium making up the gallery.  Whispering-gallery waves for light have been investigated in chaotic galleries, whose cross-sections deviate from a circle. And such waves have been used in quantum information applications.
Whispering-gallery waves have also been demonstrated for other electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, microwaves,  terahertz radiation,  infrared radiation, ultraviolet waves and x-rays.
