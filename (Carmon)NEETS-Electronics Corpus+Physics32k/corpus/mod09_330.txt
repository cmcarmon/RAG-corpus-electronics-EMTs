One useful purpose of harmonics is that of frequency multiplication. It can be used in circuits to 
multiply the fundamental frequency to a higher frequency. The need for frequency-multiplier circuits 
results from the fact that the frequency stability of most oscillators decreases as frequency increases. 
Relatively good stability can be achieved at the lower frequencies. Thus, to achieve optimum stability, an 
oscillator is operated at a low frequency, and one or more stages of multiplication are used to raise the 
signal to the desired operating frequency.
