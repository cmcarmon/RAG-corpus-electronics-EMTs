Artificial satellites are rarely placed in retrograde orbit. This is partly due to the extra velocity (and fuel) required to launch into orbit against the direction of the Earth's rotation.
Most commercial Earth-observing satellites use retrograde sun-synchronous orbits to ensure that observations are performed at the same local time each pass of any given location, while almost all communication satellites use prograde orbits.
