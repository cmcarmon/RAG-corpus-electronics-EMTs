The Emitter-Follower or Common-Collector (CC) Circuit
Suppose that RC is short-circuited in the circuit of Fig. 24.29. This will not affect the biasing because the collector
voltage may take any value (the output characteristic is nearly horizontal, as seen in Fig. 24.28). However, the
small-signal output voltage ceases to exist because there is now no load resistor across which it can be developed,
though the output current ic will continue to ï¬‚ow as before.
