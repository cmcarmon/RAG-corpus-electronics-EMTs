A diode
 
generally refers to a two-terminal solid-state semiconductor device that presents a low impedance to
current ﬂow in one direction and a high impedance to current ﬂow in the opposite direction. These properties
allow  the  diode  to  be  used  as  a  one-way  current  valve  in  electronic  circuits. 
  are  a  class  of  circuits
whose purpose is to convert ac waveforms (usually sinusoidal and with zero average value) into a waveform
that  has  a  signiﬁcant  non-zero  average  value  (dc  component).  Simply  stated,  rectiﬁers  are  ac-to-dc  energy
converter  circuits.  Most  rectiﬁer  circuits  employ  diodes  as  the  principal  elements  in  the  energy  conversion
process; thus the almost inseparable notions of diodes and rectiﬁers. The general electrical characteristics of
common diodes and some simple rectiﬁer topologies incorporating diodes are discussed.
