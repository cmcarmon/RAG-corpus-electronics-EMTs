In the Ô¨Årst chapter of this book, the concept of an atom was discussed, as being the basic
building-block of all material objects. Atoms, in turn, are composed of even smaller pieces
of matter called particles. Electrons, protons, and neutrons are the basic types of particles
found in atoms. Each of these particle types plays a distinct role in the behavior of an atom.
While electrical activity involves the motion of electrons, the chemical identity of an atom
(which largely determines how conductive the material will be) is determined by the number
of protons in the nucleus (center).
