In specifying the time interval over which this recursive relationship holds to be 0 £ n £ N, it has been tacitly
assumed that the sequence pairs are identically zero prior to n = 0. If this is not the case, then the time interval
over which relationship (14.142) holds must be changed to max(p,q) £ n £ N. In the analysis to follow, it is
assumed  that  the  appropriate  time  interval  is  0  £  n £  N.  Modiﬁcation  of  this  analysis  for  the  time  interval
max(p,q) £ n £ N is straightforward and not given.
