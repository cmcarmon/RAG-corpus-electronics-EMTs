Ampe`re’s law (equations 1.28 and 1.29) and Gauss’s law (equa-
tions 1.30 and 1.31) are the rules that all magnetostatic ﬁelds
must obey. Except in very limited situations, as discussed in the
previous section, these laws cannot be used to directly com-
pute B or H. Instead, if a given current density J is prescribed
at source coordinates r 0, the B ﬁeld can be directly computed
at any observation coordinate r using the Biot-Savart law
