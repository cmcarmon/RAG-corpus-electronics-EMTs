You should recognize the form of this equation from the capacitor chapter. It relates one
variable (in this case, inductor voltage drop) to a rate of change of another variable (in this
case, inductor current). Both voltage (v) and rate of current change (di/dt) are instantaneous:
that is, in relation to a speciﬁc point in time, thus the lower-case letters ”v” and ”i”. As with
the capacitor formula, it is convention to express instantaneous voltage as v rather than e, but
using the latter designation would not be wrong. Current rate-of-change (di/dt) is expressed in
units of amps per second, a positive number representing an increase and a negative number
representing a decrease.
