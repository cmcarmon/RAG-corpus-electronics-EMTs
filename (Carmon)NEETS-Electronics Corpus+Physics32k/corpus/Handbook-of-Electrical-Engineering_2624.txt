MOSFET current is dependent upon the carrier density in the channel, or upon VG – VTH, see Eq. (24.41).
For a long-channel device, driving ability depends also on channel length. The shorter the channel length, L,
the  greater  the  driving  ability,  because  the  channel  resistance  is  directly  proportional  to  the  channel  length.
Although  it  is  an  oversimpliﬁcation,  let  us  suppose  that  the  MOSFET  is  primarily  in  saturation  during  the
driving  of  its  load.  This  simpliﬁcation  will  allow  a  clear  discussion  of  the  issues  involved  in  making  faster
MOSFET’s without complicated mathematics. Assuming the MOSFET to be saturated over most of the switch-
ing period, driving ability is proportional to current in saturation, or to
