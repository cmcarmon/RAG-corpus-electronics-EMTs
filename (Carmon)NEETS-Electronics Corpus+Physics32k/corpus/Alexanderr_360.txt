For 
30u(t)
voltage source is replaced by a short circuit and should be regarded as
contributing nothing to 
Since the switch has been closed for a long
time,  the  capacitor  voltage  has  reached  steady  state  and  the  capacitor
acts  like  an  open  circuit.  Hence,  the  circuit  becomes  that  shown  in
Fig. 7.46(a) for
