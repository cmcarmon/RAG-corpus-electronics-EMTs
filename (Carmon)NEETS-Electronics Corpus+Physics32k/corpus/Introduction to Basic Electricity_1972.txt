Voltage is an electrical force that creates current to 
flow into a closed circuit. When voltage exists between 
two points and current cannot flow, no work is done. 
This is similar to a spring under tension that produces 
no motion. When voltage causes electrons to move in 
a circuit, work is being done. The  instantaneous	
rate at which work is done is called the electric	
power	rate and is measured in watts. Power can 
be  defined at the rate which energy is dissipated in a 
circuit. The symbol for power is P.
