Acoustic streaming is a non-linear effect.  We can decompose the velocity field in a vibration part and a steady part




u

=
v
+


u
¯




{\displaystyle {u}=v+{\overline {u}}}
. The vibration part



v


{\displaystyle v}
is due to sound, while the steady part is the acoustic streaming velocity (average velocity). The Navier–Stokes equations implies for the acoustic streaming velocity:

{\displaystyle {\overline {\rho }}{\partial _{t}{\overline {u}}_{i}}+{\overline {\rho }}{\overline {u}}_{j}{\partial _{j}{\overline {u}}_{i}}=-{\partial {\overline {p}}_{i}}+\eta {\partial _{j}^{2}{\overline {u}}_{i}}-{\partial _{j}}({\overline {\rho v_{i}v_{j}}}).}

The steady streaming originates from a steady body force

that appears on the right hand side. This force is a function of what is known as the Reynolds stresses in turbulence

{\displaystyle -{\overline {\rho v_{i}v_{j}}}}
. The Reynolds stress depends on the amplitude of sound vibrations, and the body force reflects diminutions in this sound amplitude.
We see that this stress is non-linear (quadratic) in the velocity amplitude. It is non vanishing only where the velocity amplitude varies. If the velocity of the fluid oscillates because of sound as
