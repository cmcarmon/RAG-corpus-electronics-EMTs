In designing a digital system, one often encounters a situation where the output cannot be
speciﬁed due to either physical or logical constraints. Figure 6.1.15 illustrates one such situation,
where the input lines B and C to the black box of logic circuitry are physically connected together.
For such a circuit, the input combination A = 0, B = 1, and C = 0 is not possible, and therefore
the output corresponding to this combination cannot be speciﬁed. Such an output is hence known
