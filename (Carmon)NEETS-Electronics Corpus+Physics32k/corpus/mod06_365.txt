In one way, the CRT screen is similar to a tetrode vacuum tube. Both suffer from the effects of
secondary emission. In order to reach the screen, electrons from the cathode are accelerated to relatively
high velocities. When these electrons strike the screen, they dislodge other electrons from the material of
the screen. If these secondary emission electrons are allowed to accumulate, they will form a
negatively-charged barrier between the screen and the electron beam, causing a distorted image on the
CRT screen. The method used to control secondary emission, which you are already familiar with, i.e., a
suppressor grid, is not practical in CRTâ€™s. Instead, a special coating called an AQUADAG COATING is
applied to the inside of the tube as shown in figure 2-21. This coating is composed of a conductive
material, such as graphite, and has the same high-positive potential applied to it that is applied to the
accelerating anode. This allows the aquadag to perform two functions. First, since the aquadag coating is
positive, it attracts the secondary emitted electrons and removes them. Second, because the aquadag is
operated at a high-positive potential and is mounted in front of the accelerating anode, it aids in the
acceleration of electrons toward the screen.
