Mason’s signal-ﬂowgraphs constitute a very useful graphical technique for the analysis of linear systems. This
technique  not  only  retains  the  intuitive  character  of  the  block  diagrams  but  at  the  same  time  allows  one  to
obtain the gain between an input node and an output node of a signal-ﬂowgraph by inspection. However, the
derivation of the gain formula [Eq. (3.42)] is by no means simple, and, more importantly, if more than one
input is present in the system, the gain cannot be obtained directly; that is, the principle of superposition must
be applied to determine the gain due to the presence of more than one input. Thus, by slight modiﬁcation of
the  conventions  involved  in  Mason’s  signal-ﬂowgraph,  Coates  [1959]  was  able  to  introduce  the  so-called
“ﬂowgraphs” which are suitable for direct calculation of gain.
