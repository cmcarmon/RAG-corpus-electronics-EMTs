SMT packages have been developed to maximize heat transfer to the substrate. These include PLCCs with
integral heat spreaders, the SOT-89 power transistor package, the DPAK power transistor package, and many
others. Analog ICs are also available in power packages. Note that all of these devices are designed primarily
for  processing  with  the  solder  paste  process,  and  some  speciÔ¨Åcally  recommend  against  their  use  with  wave-
solder applications. Heat sinks and heat pipes should also be considered for high-power ICs.
