The difference between a permanent and a temporary magnet has been indicated in terms of
RELUCTANCE, a permanent magnet having a high reluctance and a temporary magnet having a low
reluctance. Magnets are also described in terms of the PERMEABILITY of their materials, or the ease
with which magnetic lines of force distribute themselves throughout the material. A permanent magnet,
which is produced from a material with a high reluctance, has a low permeability. A temporary magnet,
produced from a material with a low reluctance, would have a high permeability.
