It was not until 1934 when Adrian and Matthews published their classic paper verifying Berger’s ﬁndings
that the reality of human brain waves was accepted and EEG studies were put on a ﬁrmly established basis.
One of their primary contributions was the identiﬁcation of certain rhythms in the EEG, regular oscillations
at approximately 10–12 Hz in the occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex. They found that this alpha rhythm in
the EEG would disappear when the brain displayed any type of attention or alertness or focused on objects in
the  visual  ﬁeld.  The  physiological  basis  for  these  results,  the “arousing  inﬂuence”  of  external  stimuli  on  the
