The graphs shown in figure 3-11 and 3-12 are not entirely complete. That is, the charge or discharge (or
the growth or decay) is not quite complete in 5 RC or 5 L/R time constants. However, when the values reach
0.99 of the maximum (corresponding to 5 RC or 5 L/R), the graphs may be considered accurate enough for
all practical purposes.
