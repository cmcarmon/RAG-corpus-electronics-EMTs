With all resistance places Ô¨Ålled in the table and all quantities determined in the Total
column, we can proceed to determine the other voltages and currents. Knowing that the total
resistance in this table was the result of R1//R2 and R3//R4 in series, we know that the value of
total current will be the same as that in R1//R2 and R3//R4 (because series components share the
same current). Therefore, if total current increased, then current through R1//R2 and R3//R4
must also have increased with the failure of R2:
