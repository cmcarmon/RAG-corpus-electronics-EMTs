The photovoltaic cell, or solar cell, is a device which converts light energy into electrical energy. An 
example of a solar cell and its schematic symbol are shown in figure 3-35. The symbol is similar to that of 
a battery. The device itself acts much like a battery when exposed to light and produces about .45 volt 
across its terminals, with current capacity determined by its size. As with batteries, solar cells may be 
connected in series or parallel to produce higher voltages and currents. The device is finding widespread 
application in communications satellites and solar-powered homes.
