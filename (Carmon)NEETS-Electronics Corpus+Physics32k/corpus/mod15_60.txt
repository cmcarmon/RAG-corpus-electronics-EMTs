Schematic symbols for synchros are drawn by various manufacturers in many different ways. Only 
five symbols (as shown in figure 1-3), however, meet the standard military specifications for schematic 
diagrams of synchros and synchro connections. When a symbol is used on a schematic, it will be 
accompanied by the military abbreviation of one of the eight synchro functional classifications (TR, TX, 
TDX, etc.).
