Another characteristic of a tropospheric scatter signal is its relatively low power level. Since very 
little of the scattered energy is reradiated toward the receiver, the efficiency is very low and the signal 
level at the final receiver point is low. Initial input power must be high to compensate for the low 
efficiency in the scatter volume. This is accomplished by using high-power transmitters and high-gain 
antennas, which concentrate the transmitted power into a beam, thus increasing the intensity of energy of 
each turbulence in the volume. The receiver must also be very sensitive to detect the low-level signals.
