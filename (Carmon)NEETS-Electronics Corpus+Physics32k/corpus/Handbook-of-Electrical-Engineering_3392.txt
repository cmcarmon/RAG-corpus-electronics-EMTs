Digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion
 is the complementary process of converting a continuous range of
signals. 
analog signals into digital codes. Such conversion processes are necessary to interface real-world systems, which
typically monitor continuously varying analog signals, with digital systems that process, store, interpret, and
manipulate the analog values.
