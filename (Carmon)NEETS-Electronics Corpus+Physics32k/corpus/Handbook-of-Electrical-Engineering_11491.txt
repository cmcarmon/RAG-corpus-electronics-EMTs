Clinical Information Standards
One of the most demanding and key areas for successfully integrating the hospital information system (HIS)
with the clinical information systems (CIS) from multiple clinical departments and/or clinical areas deals with
clinical information standards. Two of the driving forces behind the automation of the patient record deal with
national concerns related to healthcare costs and quality of healthcare. These concerns have generated demand
for managed care. The automated patient record could then be one of the vehicles to achieve managed care.
Clinical information standards are constantly evolving. They were developed (some are still in the process
of development; e.g., IEEE/MIB P1073) by very different sets of requirements. What follows is a brief description
and structure of most of these standards.
