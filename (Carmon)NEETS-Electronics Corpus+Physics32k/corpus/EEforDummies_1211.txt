Observe proper orientation when inserting the LED: Connect the cath-
ode (negative side, with the shorter lead) of the LED to ground. Check 
the packaging that came with your LED to make sure you get it right. (If 
you don’t, and you insert the LED backwards, nothing bad will happen, 
but the LED won’t light. Simply remove the LED and reinsert it, the other 
way around.)
