The telegraph and radiotelegraph improved man's ability to communicate by allowing speedy 
passage of information between two distant points. However, it failed to satisfy one of man's other 
communications needs; that is, the ability to hear and be heard, by voice, at a great distance. In an effort 
to improve on the telegraph, Alexander Graham Bell developed the principles on which modern 
communications are built. He developed the modulation of an electric current by complex waveforms, the 
demodulation of the resulting wave, and recovery of the original waveform. This section will examine the 
process of varying an electric current in amplitude at an audio frequency.
