The problem of designing a circuit to have a given transfer function
is called ﬁlter design. This problem can be solved using passive cir-
cuits, that is, circuits consisting entirely of resistors, capacitors, and
inductors. Further, these passive ﬁlter circuits can be designed to have
some  attractive  properties.  In  particular,  passive  ﬁlters  can  be
designed so that the transfer function is relatively insensitive to vari-
ations in the values of the resistances, capacitances, and inductances.
Unfortunately, passive circuits contain inductors. Inductors are fre-
quently large, heavy, expensive, and nonlinear.
