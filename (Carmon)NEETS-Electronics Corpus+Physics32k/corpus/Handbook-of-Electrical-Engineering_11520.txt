Hospitals are highly professionalized. Each professional group has a particular area of expertise and a unique
perspective regarding the healthcare delivery system. Hospital administrators are much like administrators of
other  organizations.  Recent  graduates  essentially  have  standard  MBA  (Master  of  Business  Administration)
degrees with some extent of healthcare specialization. However, many administrators in positions of authority
received MHA (Master of Hospital Administration) degrees from programs more closely afÔ¨Åliated with medical
schools than with business schools.
