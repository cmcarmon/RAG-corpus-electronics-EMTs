Breadboarding is essential to proving that a circuit 
design works. Breadboard is the term that is now used 
for all types of devices used for prototyping. In 1971, 
Ronald J. Portugal of EI Instruments Inc. designed the 
solderless	breadboard most commonly used to-
day. It is usually manufactured from white plastic, with 
perforation and numerous metal clips to plug wires 
and components in (Figure 5-13). The spacing be-
tween the perforations is typically 0.1 inch (0.25 cm), 
the same as the spacing of the leads on an integrated 
circuit.
