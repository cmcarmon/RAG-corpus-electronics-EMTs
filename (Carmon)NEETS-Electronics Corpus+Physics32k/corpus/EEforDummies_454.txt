Varying the RC time constant
To see that you really can control the time it takes to charge and discharge 
a capacitor, you can build the circuit shown in Figure 7‚Äê10 and use your mul-
timeter to observe the voltage changes across the capacitor. You can also 
observe the capacitor holding its charge (that is, storing electrical energy).
