voltage from anode to cathode) is applied across the diode, current is 
prohibited from flowing. (Actually, a small amount of current, in the μA 
range, will flow.)
If the reverse‐biased voltage exceeds a certain level (usually 50 V or 
more), the diode breaks down and reverse current starts flowing from 
cathode to anode. The reverse voltage at which the diode breaks down 
is known as the peak reverse voltage (PRV), or peak inverse voltage (PIV).
