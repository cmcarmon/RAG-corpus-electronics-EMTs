A knife switch is nothing more than a conductive lever, free to pivot on a hinge, coming
into physical contact with one or more stationary contact points which are also conductive.
The switch shown in the above illustration is constructed on a porcelain base (an excellent
insulating material), using copper (an excellent conductor) for the ”blade” and contact points.
The handle is plastic to insulate the operator’s hand from the conductive blade of the switch
when opening or closing it.
