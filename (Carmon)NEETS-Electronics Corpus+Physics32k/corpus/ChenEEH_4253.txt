. Source routing: The routing algorithm was developed by
IEEE 802.5. Each source station determines the route that
the frame will take and includes a sequence of LAN and
bridge identiﬁers in the route information ﬁeld (RIF).
The route information is obtained by discovery of broad-
cast frames sent by a source station. The approach re-
quires the changes (additional bits) to the MAC frame
format
