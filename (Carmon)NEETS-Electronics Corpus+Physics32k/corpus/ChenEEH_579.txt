The gate turn-off thyristor (GTO) adds gate-controlled turn-
off capability to the thyristor. In a GTO, modiﬁcations are
made to ensure that the base current of the transistor n1p2n2
is brieﬂy made less than the value needed to maintain satur-
ation (IB2 < IC=b). This forces the transistor to go into the
active region. The regenerative action pulls both transistors out
of saturation into the active region and eventually into turn-off
mode. A GTO requires complex interdigitated layout of gate
and cathode. Anode short structures further suppress regener-
ation. The turn-off capability of a GTO is gained at the expense
of on-state performance. Other variations in structure, such as
the reverse-conducting thyristor (RCTs), asymmetrical silicon-
controlled-rectiﬁer (ASCR),
light-triggered thyristor (LTT),
and so forth, are applied in many modern power electronic
applications.
