The optimum number, size, and location of capacitor banks on a feeder is determined by detailed computer
analyses. The concept of optimization includes the minimization of the operation, installation, and investment
costs.  The  most  important  factor  that  affects  the  selection  is  the  distribution  and  power  factor  of  loads.  In
residential areas, the load is uniformly distributed. In this case the optimum location of the capacitor bank is
around two-thirds of the length of the feeder.
