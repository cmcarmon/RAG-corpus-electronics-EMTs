Sum-of-products As the name implies,
logic expressions in the sum-of-
products form are represented using two levels of operations as a set of product
(AND) terms, each comprising one or more variables in their true forms (for
example, A) or complement forms (e.g., A), combined using the OR function.
For example, the logic expression AD + ABC + ABC is in a sum-of-
products representation containing the sum of three product terms. The first
term contains two variables, while the latter two terms contain three variables
each. The expression AB+C+D+B is also in a sum-of-products representation.
The expression AB + C, however, is not in a sum of products representa-
tion, and neither is the expression (A+ B)(B+ C). (Section 5.5 will discuss how
we can convert such expressions to a sum-of-products representation.)
