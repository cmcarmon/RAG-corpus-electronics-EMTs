If the correct tools are used and the proper procedures followed, crimp-on connections are more 
effective electrically, as well as mechanically, than soldered connections. A visual inspection is very 
important. It reveals oxidation, deterioration, overheating, and broken conductors. In some cases it may 
be necessary to check these connections with an ohmmeter. The proper resistance, for all practical 
purposes, should be zero. Any defective terminal should be removed and a new terminal crimped on.
