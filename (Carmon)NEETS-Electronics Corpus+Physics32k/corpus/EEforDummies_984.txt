terminal is often assumed to be at 0 volts, unless clearly distinguished 
as different from the zero‐voltage reference (known as common ground 
and detailed later in this chapter). Conventional current flows out of the 
positive terminal and into the negative terminal when the battery is con-
nected in to a complete circuit.
