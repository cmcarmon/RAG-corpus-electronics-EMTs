The  discussion  that  follows  is  not  all-inclusive  but  rather  is  intended  to  present  (1)  an  overview  of  such
applications and (2) a few of the more current topics which are impacting the shop ﬂoor, particularly as related
to  ﬂexible  manufacturing  systems.  In  the  latter  case,  such  issues  include  developments  in  sensor  integration,
mobility, sensory interactive grippers/hands, and issues pertaining to intelligent machines and robots. An important
reference for many if not all robotic topics is the International Encylopedia of Robotics edited by Dorf [1988].
