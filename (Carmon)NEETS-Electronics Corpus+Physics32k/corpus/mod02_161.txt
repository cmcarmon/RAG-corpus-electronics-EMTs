Power loss in a capacitor may be attributed to dielectric hysteresis and dielectric leakage. Dielectric
hysteresis may be defined as an effect in a dielectric material similar to the hysteresis found in a magnetic
material. It is the result of changes in orientation of electron orbits in the dielectric because of the rapid
reversals of the polarity of the line voltage. The amount of power loss due to dielectric hysteresis depends
upon the type of dielectric used. A vacuum dielectric has the smallest power loss.
