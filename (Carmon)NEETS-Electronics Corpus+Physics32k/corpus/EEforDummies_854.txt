electronics projects typically use a motor that works in the 4.5 V to 12 V 
range. Also note the manufacturer’s nominal voltage and stated rpm for 
the motor. The motor runs at this rpm when you supply the nominal 
voltage. If you supply less than the nominal voltage, the motor runs 
slower than the stated rpm. If you supply more, it may run faster but it’ll 
probably burn out.
