Current Status of HPGe Detector Technology
High-purity germanium detectors are a mature commercial technology. Process development in crystal growing
and  diode  fabrication  have  been  conducted  in  private  industry  where  signiﬁcant  advances  are  proprietary.
However, the results of technological advances in these areas are quite evident in the continual improvement
in the size, performance, and availability of HPGe detectors. Maximum photopeak efﬁciency for HPGe gamma-
ray detectors is doubling every 6 to 8 years. Concurrently, energy resolutions are moving toward the theoretical
limits of Eq. (116.7) as the concentrations of trapping centers are reduced.
