the surface of the earth has a greater velocity than that near the surface because friction retards the lower
layers (see figure 1-16). The velocity of the wind is added to the velocity of the sound through the air. The
result is that the upper portion of the sound wave moves faster than the lower portion and causes a gradual
change in the direction of travel of the wave. Refraction causes sound to travel farther with the wind than
against it.
