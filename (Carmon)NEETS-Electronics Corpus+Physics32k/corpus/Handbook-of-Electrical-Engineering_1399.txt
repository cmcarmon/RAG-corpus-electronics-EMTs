When the clean signal is available for encoding the design problem is similarly deﬁned, and it is obtained from
Eq. (15.6) using z = y. The design problem in Eq. (15.6) is not standard since the encoder operates and represents
different sources. The problem can be transformed into a standard coding problem by appropriately modifying
the distortion measure. This was shown by Berger in 1971 and Ephraim and Gray in 1988 [Ephraim, 1992].
Speciﬁcally, deﬁne the modiﬁed distortion measure by
