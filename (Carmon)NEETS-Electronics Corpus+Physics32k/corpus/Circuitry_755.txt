is 
generally enhanced by the use of active-low inputs 
(i.e. a logic 0 state at the input is used to assert the 
condition required). The debounce circuit shown in 
Fig.  16.14  is  adequate  for  most  toggle,  slide  and 
push-button type switches. The value of the 100 D
resistor takes into account the low-state sink current 
required  by  IC1  (normally  1.6  mA  for  standard 
TTL and 400 ÂµA for LS-TTL). This resistor should 
not  be  allowed  to  exceed  approximately  470  D in 
order  to  maintain  a  valid  logic  0  input  state.  The 
values quoted generate an approximate 1 ms delay 
(during which the switch contacts will have settled 
into  their  final  state).  It  should  be  noted  that,  on 
power-up, this circuit generates a logic 1 level for 
approximately  1  ms  before  the  output  reverts  to  a 
logic  0  in  the  inactive  state.  The  circuit  obeys  the 
following state table:

An  alternative,  but  somewhat  more  complex, 
switch  de-bouncing  arrangement  is  shown  in  Fig. 
16.15.  Here  a  single-pole  double-throw  (SPDT) 
changeover  switch  is  employed.  This  arrangement 
has  the  advantage  of  providing  complementary 
outputs and it obeys the following state table:
