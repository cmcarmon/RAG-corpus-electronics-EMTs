MAB	=	(NB)	(NA)	(PAB)
When	explained,	the	formula	highlights	that	the	mutual	inductance	between
inductor	A	and	inductor	B	(or	MAB)	is	equal	to	the	product	of	3	elements:	[1]	the
coils	of	inductor	B	(or	NB),	[2]	the	coils	of	inductor	A	(or	NA),	and	[3]	the
permeance	of	inductor	A	and	inductor	B	(or	PAB).
On	the	other	hand,	self-inductance	refers	to	voltage	induction	of	a	current-carrying
system	in	respect	to	the	changing	current	in	the	circuit.	It	points	out	that
eventually,	there	will	be	another	current	that	will	flow	along	with	the	primary
current.	Due	to	the	amount	of	force	within	the	magnetic	field,	voltage	is	induced;
particularly,	voltage	is	self-induced.
