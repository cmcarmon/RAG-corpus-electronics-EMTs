As you recall from NEETS, Module 1, the losses in a transformer are classified as copper loss,
eddy-current loss, and hysteresis loss. Copper loss is not affected by frequency, as it depends upon the
resistance of the winding and the current through the winding. Similarly, eddy-current loss is mostly a
function of induced voltage rather than the frequency of that voltage. Hysteresis loss, however, increases
as frequency increases.
