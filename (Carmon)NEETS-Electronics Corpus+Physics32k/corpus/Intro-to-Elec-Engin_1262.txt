13.4.1 A 100-kW, 250-V shunt generator has an
armature-circuit resistance of 0.05  and a Ô¨Åeld-
circuit resistance of 60 . With the generator
operating at rated voltage, determine the induced
voltage at (a) full load, and (b) one-half full load.
Neglect brush-contact drop.
13.4.2 A 100-kW, 230-V shunt generator has Ra =
0.05  and Rf = 57.5 . If the generator oper-
ates at rated voltage, calculate the induced volt-
age at (a) full load, and (b) one-half full load.
Neglect brush-contact drop.
