In a preliminary system design, the designer usually seeks one or more concepts which will meet the speciﬁ-
cations,  and  in  engineering  practice  each  concept  is  generally  subjected  to  some  form  of  analysis.  For  linear
systems, the signal ﬂowgraph of Mason is widely used in this activity. The ﬂowgraph analysis is popular because
it depicts the relationships existing between system variables, and the graphical structure may be manipulated
using Mason’s formulas to obtain system transfer functions in symbolic or symbolic/numerical form.
