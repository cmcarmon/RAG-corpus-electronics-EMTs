View A of figure 4-2 shows the schematic diagram for a STEP-UP transformer; view B shows a 
STEP-DOWN transformer; and, view C shows a STEP-UP, CENTER-TAPPED transformer. The step-up 
and step-down transformers were discussed in earlier NEETS modules, so only the center-tapped 
transformer will be mentioned in this chapter. The primary purpose of the center-tapped transformer is to 
provide two equal voltages to the conventional full-wave rectifier.
