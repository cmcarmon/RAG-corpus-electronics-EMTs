Once again, it should be apparent that the current through each resistor is related to its re-
sistance, given that the voltage across all resistors is the same. Rather than being directly pro-
portional, the relationship here is one of inverse proportion. For example, the current through
R1 is twice as much as the current through R3, which has twice the resistance of R1.
