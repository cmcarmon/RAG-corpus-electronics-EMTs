Transporter erector launchers are wheeled and tracked land vehicles for the launch of surface to air, and surface to surface missiles. In most systems the missiles are transported in a horizontal out of battery configuration, in order to fire the vehicle must stop and the transport/launch tube is raised to the vertical before firing.
BAe has filed patents relating to the use of Vertical Launch missiles from modified passenger aircraft.
