Digital data sources typically use BSRs, while noise generators often use LCAs. A logic diagram for a simple
BSR is shown in Fig. 78.5. This BSR consists of a clock, six D-type ﬂip-ﬂops (F/F), and an exclusive OR gate
denoted  by  a  modulo-two  adder.  If  all  the  F/F  are  initialized  to  1,  the  output  of  the  device  is  the  waveform
shown  in  Fig. 78.6.  Notice  that  the  waveform  is  periodic  with  period  63  =  26  –  1,  but  within  one  cycle  the
output has many of the properties of a random sequence. This demonstrates all the properties of the BSR, LCA,
and more advanced PN sequence generators. All PN generators have memory and must therefore be initialized
by the user before the ﬁrst sample is generated. The initialization data is typically called the seed. One must
choose this seed carefully to ensure the output will have the desired properties (in this example, one must avoid
setting all F/F to zero). All PN sequence generators will produce periodic sequences. This may or may not be
