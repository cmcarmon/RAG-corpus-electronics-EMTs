A word is in order regarding spectral estimation techniques. Two basic techniques can be used for spectral
estimation: Fourier techniques and model-based techniques. In most simulation problems one is blessed with
a tremendous amount of data concerning sampled waveforms but does not have a simple model describing
how these waveforms are produced. For this reason model-based spectral estimation is typically not used. The
most common form of spectral estimation used in simulation is the Welch periodogram. While this approach
is straightforward, the effects of windowing the data sequence must be carefully considered, and tens or even
hundreds of data windows must be averaged to achieve an accurate estimate of the power spectral density.
