The more challenging problem is to generate the test patterns to verify that none of the signal propagations
along a given logic path require longer than the clock-period time to complete. A path-delay test pattern is a
pair of patterns that generates the desired signal transition(s) and provides the sensitization of the signal paths
whereby the generated transition(s) is (are) sensitized through the combinational circuit to the input of a ﬂip-
ﬂop where it will be captured when the system clock is applied. For example, Fig. 85.24 shows a combinational
circuit  and  identiﬁes  a  speciﬁc  signal  path  for  which  the  path  delay  is  to  be  measured.  To  determine  the
appropriate path-delay test patterns, a dummy AND gate is ﬁrst added to the circuit as shown. An input to the
AND gate is derived from the output of the combinational circuit through which the input signal transition is
to be propagated. This signal is used in its true or complemented form depending upon whether the ﬁnal value
of the signal transition is a logic 1 or logic 0, respectively. Other inputs to the dummy AND gate come from
all  remaining  inputs  of  gates  through  which  the  desired  signal  transitions  must  ﬂow.  If  the  desired  signal
transition is ﬂowing through an AND or NAND gate, the remaining inputs of these gates are also fed to the
inputs of the dummy AND gate, whereas if the desired signal transitions ﬂow through OR or NOR gates, their
remaining inputs are inverted and then connected to the inputs of the dummy AND gate. The dummy AND
gate  is  not  actually  implemented  as  part  of  the  combinational  logic  but  rather  acts  as  a  convenient  place  to
