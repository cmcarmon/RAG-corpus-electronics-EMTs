 
If  you  take  a  careful  look  at  Fig.  A8.13  you 
should notice that, for odd powers of x (i.e. x1, x3,
x5, and  x-1) the  graph  will  have  values  in  the  first 
and third quadrant whilst for even powers of x (i.e. 
x2 and x4) the graph will have values in the first and 
second quadrants.
