Another biasing method that can lead to similar results is the method shown in Fig. 24.10. In this method
the bottom end of the source biasing resistor goes to a negative supply voltage VSS instead of to ground. The
gate-to-source bias voltage is now given by VGS = VG –VS = 0 – (IDS · RS + VSS) so that for RS we now have RS =
(–VGS  –  VSS)/IDS.  If  VSS  =  –10 V,  and  as  before  IDS  =  5 mA  and VGS  =  –1.17 V,  we  have  RS  =  11.7 V/5 mA  =
2.34 kW, and thus gm RS = 7.9 as in the preceding example. So this method does indeed lead to results similar
to that for the RS and VGG combination biasing. With either of these two methods the change in IDS due to a
10% change in VP will be only 0.9%, and the change in IDS due to a 10% change in IDSS will be only 1.6%.
