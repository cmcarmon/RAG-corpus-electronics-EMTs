Two other logic blocks that are sometimes used are the EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR) and
EXCLUSIVE NOR (COINCIDENCE) gates. Their conventional symbols together with their
truth tables are shown in Figures 6.1.6 and 6.1.7, respectively. It is also possible to synthesize
these logic blocks by combining the basic OR, AND, as well as NOT logic gates.
