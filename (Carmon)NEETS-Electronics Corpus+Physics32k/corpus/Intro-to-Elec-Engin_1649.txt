The matrix formulations associated with state-variable techniques have largely replaced
the block-diagram formulations. Computer software for solving a great variety of state-equation
formulations is available on most computer systems today. However, in the state-variable for-
mulation, much of the physical reality of any system is lost, including the relationships between
system response and system parameters.
