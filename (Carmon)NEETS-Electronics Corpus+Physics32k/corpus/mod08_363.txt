NOTE: It should be stressed at this point that for purpose of explanation the operational amplifier is
a theoretically perfect amplifier. In actual practice we are dealing with less than perfect. In the practical
operational amplifier there will be a slight input current with a resultant power loss. This small signal can
be measured at the theoretical point of virtual ground. This does not indicate faulty operation.
