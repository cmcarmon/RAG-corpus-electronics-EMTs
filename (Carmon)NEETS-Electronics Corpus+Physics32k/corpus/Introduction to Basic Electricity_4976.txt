In practice, more than two layers are used for 
dense, highly populated boards or for performance 
considerations. Two layers are inadequate with densely 
populated printed circuit boards because the parts are 
so close together and the traces and holes take up too 
much space. There simply isnâ€™t room for all the traces, 
holes, and vias on two sides. Vias are connections 
between one layer and another (Figure 48-10). If the 
density could be reduced, the two-layer theory would 
work.
