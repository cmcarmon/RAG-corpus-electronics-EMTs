The Smith chart is a graphical tool for determination of the
reﬂection coefﬁcient and impedance along a transmission line.
It is an integral part of microwave circuit performance visual-
ization, modern computer-aided design (CAD) tools, and RF/
microwave test instrumentation. Basically, a Smith chart is a
polar graph of normalized line impedance in the complex
reﬂection coefﬁcient plane. Let Z ¼ R þ jX be the impedance
at some location along a lossless line. The reﬂection coefﬁcient
is given by:
