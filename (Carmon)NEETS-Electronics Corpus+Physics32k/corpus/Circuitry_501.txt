state. Now remove the SET link (to make SET = 1). 
Once  again,  observe  and  record  the  state  of  the 
outputs.  Replace  the  SET  link  (to  make  SET  =  0) 
and  once  again  check  that  the  bistable  does  not 
change  state.  Finally,  remove  both  links  (to  make 
SET = 1 and RESET = 1) and observe the state of 
the outputs in this disallowed state.
Conclusion 
Comment on the truth table produced. Is this what 
you would expect? What happened when both SET 
and  RESET  inputs  were  at  logic  1?  Suggest  a 
typical application for the circuit.
