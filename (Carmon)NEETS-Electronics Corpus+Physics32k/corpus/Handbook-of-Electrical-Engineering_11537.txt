The choice of cell size is critical in applying FDTD. It must be small enough to permit accurate results at the
highest frequency of interest, and yet be large enough to keep resource requirements manageable. Cell size is directly
affected by the materials present. The greater the permittivity and/or conductivity, the shorter the wavelength at a
given  frequency  and  the  smaller  the  cell  size  required.  Once  the  cell  size  is  selected,  the  maximum  time  step  is
determined by the Courant stability condition. After the user determines the cell size, a problem space large enough
to encompass the scattering object, plus space between the object and the absorbing outer boundary, is determined.
From the number of Yee cells needed and the number of time steps required, resource requirements can be estimated.
The fundamental constraint is that the cell size must be much less than the smallest wavelength for which
accurate results are desired. An often quoted constraint is “10 cells per wavelength”, meaning that the side of
each  cell  should  be  1/10  of  the  wavelength  at  the  highest  frequency  (shortest  wavelength)  of  interest.  Since
FDTD  is  a  volumetric  computational  method,  if  some  portion  of  the  computational  space  is  ﬁlled  with
  to  determine  the  maximum  cell  size.  For
penetrable  material,  one  must  use  the  wavelength 
problems containing biological materials, this results in cells in the material that are much smaller than if only
free space and perfect conductors were being considered.
