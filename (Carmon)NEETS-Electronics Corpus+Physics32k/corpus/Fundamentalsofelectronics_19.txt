Photographs are static, and are continuous-valued signals deﬁned over space. Black-and-white images
have only one value at each point in space, which amounts to its optical reﬂection properties. In Figure 1.2,
an image is shown, demonstrating that it (and all other images as well) are functions of two independent
spatial variables.
