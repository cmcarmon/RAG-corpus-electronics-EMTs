As you can see, eddy current losses are kept low when the core material is made up of many thin 
sheets of metal. Laminations in a small generator armature may be as thin as 1/64 inch. The laminations 
are insulated from each other by a thin coat of lacquer or, in some instances, simply by the oxidation of 
the surfaces. Oxidation is caused by contact with the air while the laminations are being annealed. The 
insulation value need not be high because the voltages induced are very small.
