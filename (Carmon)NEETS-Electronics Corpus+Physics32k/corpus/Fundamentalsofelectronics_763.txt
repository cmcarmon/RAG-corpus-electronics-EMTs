For most antenna-based wireless systems, how the signal diminishes as the receiver moves further from
the transmitter derives by considering how radiated power changes with distance from the transmitting
antenna. An antenna radiates a given amount of power into free space, and ideally this power propagates
without loss in all directions. Considering a sphere centered at the transmitter, the total power, which is
found by integrating the radiated power over the surface of the sphere, must be constant regardless of the
sphere’s radius. This requirement results from the conservation of energy. Thus, if p (d) represents the power
integrated with respect to direction at a distance d from the antenna, the total power will be p (d) 4πd2. For
this quantity to be a constant, we must have
