Another thing to remember when you are measuring resistance is the tolerance of the resistor. If the
tolerance of the resistor in the preceding example is 10 percent, we would expect a reading between
approximately 2,160 and 2,640 ohms. If the reading is not within these limits, the resistor has probably
changed value and should be discarded.
