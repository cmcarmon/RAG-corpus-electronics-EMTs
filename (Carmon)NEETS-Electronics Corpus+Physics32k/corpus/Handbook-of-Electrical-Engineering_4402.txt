The OVD Process. The OVD process does not use a starting tube; instead, a stream of soot particles of desired
composition is deposited on a bait rod (Fig. 42.23). The soot particles are produced by the reaction of reactants
in a fuel gas-oxygen ﬂame. A cylindrical porous soot preform is built layer by layer. After the deposition of the
core  and  cladding  is  complete,  the  bait  rod  is  removed.  The  porous  preform  is  then  sintered  and  dried  in  a
furnace at 1400–1600(cid:176)C to form a clear bubble-free preform under a controlled environment. The central hold
left by the blank may or may not be closed, depending on the type of preform. The preform is now ready for
inspection and drawing.
