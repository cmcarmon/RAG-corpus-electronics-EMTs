Yaglom had worked in many fields in applied mathematics and statistics, including theory of random processes and the statistical theory of fluid mechanics. His initial studies on the theory of random functions were published in the lengthy 1952-article "Introduction to the Theory of Random Functions" which appeared in the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk. Later, this work was published in United States. His study on local structure of the acceleration field in a turbulent flow established the fact that the frequency spectrum of Lagrangian acceleration of a fluid particle in a turbulent flow is constant. This work was later independently repeated by Werner Heisenberg.
