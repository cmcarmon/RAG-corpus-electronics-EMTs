Another dramatic change took place in the telephone network in 1965; it was called software. It came with
the marriage of the computer and the telephone switching system in the ﬁrst stored-program control switch.
With  the  introduction  of  switching  software  came  a  family  of  Custom  Calling  services  (speed  calling,  call
waiting, call forwarding, and three-way calling) for residential customers, and a robust set of Centrex features
(station attendant, call transfer, abbreviated dialing, etc.) for business customers. The ﬁrst software programs
for  these  stored-program  control  switches  contained  approximately  100,000  lines  of  code;  by  1990  some  of
these switching systems became enormously complex, containing 10 million lines of code and offering hundreds
of different services to telephone users.
