Frequency domain curve-ﬁtting is a technique to ﬁt a TFM
closely into the observed FRF data. Like other system identiﬁ-
cation techniques, this is a two-step procedure: model struc-
ture selection and model parameter optimization. In this
context, the ﬁrst step is to parameterize the TFM in some
special forms. Two such forms are introduced in the following:
the matrix fraction (MF) parameterization and the polynomial
matrix (PM) parameterization. This is always a critical step in
the identiﬁcation because it will generally lead to quite differ-
ent parameter optimization algorithms and resulting model
properties. In particular, this section shows that for the MF
form, the parameters can be optimized by means of linear least
squares (LLS) solutions. As for the PM parameterization,
one has to resort to some nonlinear techniques; speciﬁcally,
this section introduces the celebrated Gauss-Newton (GN)
method. On the other hand, the PM parameterization offers
more ﬂexibility in the sense that it allows the designer to
specify certain properties of the identiﬁed model (e.g., ﬁxed
zeros in any input/output channels). This feature may be quite
desirable as shown by the application studies in Section 6.4.
