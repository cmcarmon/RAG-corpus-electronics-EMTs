impedance is a few GΩ. At first, it may be difficult to understand how a very high gain 
amplifier can be useful since a very small differential voltage will send the output to rail 
to  its  maximum  or  minimum  value.  However,  op  amps  are  designed  to  operate  in 
feedback,  which  regulates  the  output  voltage  according  to  the  input  as  a  result  of 
amplifier’s configuration.
