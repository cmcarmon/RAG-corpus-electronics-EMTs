To close this section, let us summarize three important observations. The
first observation is that second-order capacitor-inductor circuits are capable
of oscillation. This is in contrast to first-order resistor-capacitor and resistor-
inductor circuits. The second observation is that we have now seen a third time
constant to go along with the RC time constant associated with first-order
