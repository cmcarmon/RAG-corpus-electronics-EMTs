A 250-V, 50-kW short-shunt compound dc generator, whose schematic diagram is shown in Figure
E13.4.1(a), has the following data: armature resistance 0.05 , series-ﬁeld resistance 0.05 , and
shunt-ﬁeld resistance 130 . Determine the induced armature emf at rated load and terminal
voltage, while taking 2 V as the total brush-contact drop.
