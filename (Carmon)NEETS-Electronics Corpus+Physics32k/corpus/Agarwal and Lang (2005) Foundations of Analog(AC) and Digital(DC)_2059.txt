The magnitude curves of the frequency response for a range of values of Q
are shown in Figure 14.36. As in our bandpass example, Q can be increased by
decreasing the value of the resistance R. Notice that the response curve displays
some very interesting behavior for values of the drive frequency ω that are close
to ωo. Specifically, the magnitude of the capacitor voltage for drive frequency
ω = ωo can far exceed the input drive voltage for large values of Q. This is in
stark contrast to the magnitude of the voltage across the resistor, which never
exceeds the input drive voltage (see Figure 14.34). Furthermore, as with the
bandpass filter, the higher the value of Q, the greater the ‘‘peakiness’’ of the
curve near ωo.
