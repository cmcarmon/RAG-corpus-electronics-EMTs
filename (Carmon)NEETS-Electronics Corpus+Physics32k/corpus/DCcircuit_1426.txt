Note that we’re choosing to analyze voltage because that is the quantity capacitors tend to
hold constant. Although the formula works quite well for current, the starting and ﬁnal values
for current are actually derived from the capacitor’s voltage, so calculating voltage is a more
direct method. The resistance is 10 kΩ, and the capacitance is 100 µF (microfarads). Since the
time constant (τ ) for an RC circuit is the product of resistance and capacitance, we obtain a
value of 1 second:
