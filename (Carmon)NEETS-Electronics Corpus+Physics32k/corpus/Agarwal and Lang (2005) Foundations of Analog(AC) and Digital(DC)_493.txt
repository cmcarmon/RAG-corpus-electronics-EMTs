Next, we obtain Ii, the response of the current source acting alone. The subcircuit
corresponding to the current source acting alone is shown in Figure 3.43.
By the current divider relation, it is easy to see that Ii = 0.5 A, since the 1-A current
supplied by the current source divides equally into the two branches of the subcircuit in
Figure 3.43.
