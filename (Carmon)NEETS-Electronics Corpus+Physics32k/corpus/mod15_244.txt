MAXIMUM INDUCED STATOR VOLTAGE occurs in a single synchro stator coil each time 
there is maximum magnetic coupling between the rotor and the stator coil. This voltage is approximately 
equal to the product of the effective voltage on the primary, the secondary-to-primary turns ratio, and the 
magnetic coupling between the rotor and the stator coil.
