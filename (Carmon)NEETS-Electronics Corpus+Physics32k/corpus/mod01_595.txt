Power computations in a parallel circuit are essentially the same as those used for the series circuit.
Since power dissipation in resistors consists of a heat loss, power dissipations are additive regardless of
how the resistors are connected in the circuit. The total power is equal to the sum of the power dissipated
by the individual resistors. Like the series circuit, the total power consumed by the parallel circuit is:
