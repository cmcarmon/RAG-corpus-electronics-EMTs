Basically, good voltage means that the average voltage level is
correct, that variations are within acceptable voltage limits,
and that sudden and momentary changes in voltage level do
not cause objectionable light ﬂicker. Naturally, the utilization
voltage of the consumer varies with changing load on the
system as well as the location of the consumer on the system.
Voltage variation, however,
is usually less then 5% at the
consumer’s meter.
