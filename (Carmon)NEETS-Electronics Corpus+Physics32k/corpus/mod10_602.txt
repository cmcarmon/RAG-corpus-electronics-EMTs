Look at the current and voltage (charge) distribution on the antenna in figure 4-6. A maximum 
movement of electrons is in the center of the antenna at all times; therefore, the center of the antenna is at 
a low impedance. This condition is called a STANDING WAVE of current. The points of high current 
and high voltage are known as current and voltage LOOPS. The points of minimum current and minimum 
voltage are known as current and voltage NODES. View A shows a current loop and current nodes. View 
B shows voltage loops and a voltage node. View C shows the resultant voltage and current loops and 
nodes. The presence of standing waves describes the condition of resonance in an antenna. At resonance 
the waves travel back and forth in the antenna reinforcing each other and the electromagnetic waves are 
transmitted into space at maximum radiation. When the antenna is not at resonance, the waves tend to 
cancel each other and lose energy in the form of heat.
