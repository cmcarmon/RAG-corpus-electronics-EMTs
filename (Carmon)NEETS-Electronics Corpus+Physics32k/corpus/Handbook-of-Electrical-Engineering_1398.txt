When only noisy signals are available for coding, the encoder operates on the noisy signal while representing
the clean signal. In this case, the encoder is designed by minimizing the average distortion between the clean
signal and the encoded signal. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, let y denote the vector of clean signal to be encoded. Let z denote
the corresponding given vector of the noisy signal. Let q denote the encoder. Let d denote a distortion measure.
Then, the optimal encoder is designed by
