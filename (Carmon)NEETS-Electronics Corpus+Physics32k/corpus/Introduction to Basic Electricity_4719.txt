execute a different program or to repeat a portion of 
the same program. The instructions can be uncon-
ditional, where the content of the program counter 
changes, or conditional, where the state of a flag bit 
is first checked to determine whether the content of 
the program counter should change. If the condi-
tion of the flag bit is not met, the next instruction is 
executed.
