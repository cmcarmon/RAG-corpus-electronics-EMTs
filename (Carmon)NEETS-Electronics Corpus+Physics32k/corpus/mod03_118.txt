 2 will carry
nine-tenths of the current. R2 is a SHUNT resistor because it diverts, or shunts, a portion of the current
from the meter movement (R1). By this method, a 10-ampere meter movement will measure current up to
100 amperes. By adding a second scale to the face of the meter, the current can be read directly.
