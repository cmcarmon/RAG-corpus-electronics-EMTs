An interpreter translates each high-level-language statement into its equivalent set of
machine-language instructions, which are then executed right away. Interpretive languages such
as Basic are very inefﬁcient for programs with loops (repetitive instructions). The inefﬁciency is
corrected by a compiler, which translates the complete high-level language into machine language.
Once the whole program is compiled, it can be executed as many times as desired without any
need for recompilation. Examples of compiler languages are Fortran, Pascal, and C.
