The term lunar day may also refer to the period between moonrises or high moon in a particular location on Earth. This period is typically about 50 minutes longer than a 24-hour Earth day, as the Moon orbits the Earth in the same direction as the Earth's axial rotation.
The term lunar day is also used in the context of night and day, i.e., opposite to the lunar night. This is is common in discussions of the huge difference in temperatures, such as discussion about the Lunar rovers "Soviet Unionâ€™s Luna missions, were designed to survive one lunar day (two Earth weeks).
