The reason for the downward curve can be illustrated using line AB in figure 1-13. Line AB
represents the surface of a wavefront with point A higher in altitude than point B. As wavefront AB
moves to the point represented by A’B’, the speed at A and A’ is faster than the speed at B and  B’ since A
and  A’ are at a greater altitude. Therefore, in a given time, the upper part of the wavefront moves farther
than the lower part. The wavefront leans slightly forward as it moves. Since the direction of energy
propagation is always perpendicular to the surface of a wavefront, the tilted wavefront causes the energy
path to curve downward.
