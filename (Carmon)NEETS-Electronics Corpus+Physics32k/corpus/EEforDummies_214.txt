Tiny semiconductor transistors (which I discuss in ChapterÂ 10) are at the 
heart of most of the switching that goes on in electronic systems today. 
The way in which a transistor works is a bit complicated, but the basic idea 
behind transistor switching is this: You use a small electric current to control 
the switching action of a transistor, and that switching action controls the 
flow of a much larger current.
