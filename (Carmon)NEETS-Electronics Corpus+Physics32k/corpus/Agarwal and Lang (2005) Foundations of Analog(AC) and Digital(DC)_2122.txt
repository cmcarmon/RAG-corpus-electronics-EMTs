For the feedback to be negative in simple Op Amp circuits, the attenuated
output signal must be fed back to the v
+
fed back only to the v
see. The first-order consequences of these connections will be explored in
this chapter, but more complex issues of stability and oscillations are dealt
with in books on Signals and Systems.
