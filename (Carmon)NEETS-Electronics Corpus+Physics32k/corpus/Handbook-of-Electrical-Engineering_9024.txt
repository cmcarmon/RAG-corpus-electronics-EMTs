Electrostatic Printing
There are two basic approaches that have been developed: (1) one using a special dielectric paper, and (2) the
other using plain paper. In the Ô¨Årst approach, a page-wide linear array of electrode discharge pins are inde-
pendently pulsed to charge the surface of a moving, conductive-base, dielectric-coated paper. Both powder and
liquid toners may be used to develop the image; thermal fusing of the image is required for powder toner. With
the plain paper version, either a precharged or uncharged dielectric drum or belt can be used depending on
whether the array of electrode pins are used to charge or discharge the media surface. The other process steps
are essentially the same as with the nominal EP printing process. Cost savings can be realized by multiplexing
the electrode driver lines because there is a process threshold of hundreds of volts. This requires, however, that
segmented counter electrodes be positioned behind the receiving surface (drum, belt, or paper).
