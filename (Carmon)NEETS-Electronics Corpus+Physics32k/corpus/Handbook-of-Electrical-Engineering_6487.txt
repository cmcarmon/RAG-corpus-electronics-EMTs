where 
  is  a  weighting  factor  (13.8  dB)  that  accounts  for  the  way  the  eye  responds  to  noise  in  the  video
bandwidth, and PE is a pre-emphasis factor (0â€“5 dB) that is gained by emphasizing the high-frequency video
components to improve the performance of the FM modulator. High-quality video (SNR = 55 dB) requires a
CNR of only 16 dB. This is achieved easily in a lightwave transmission system.
