To relate back to the analysis methods used in Chapter 10, let us now calculate
the response of the attenuator to a voltage step, as shown in Figure 13.48. Note
first that the system is still first order, in spite of the two capacitors. We know
this because it is not possible to specify two independent initial conditions,
only one.
