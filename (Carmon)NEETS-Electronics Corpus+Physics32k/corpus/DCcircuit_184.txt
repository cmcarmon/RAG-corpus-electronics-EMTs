voltage will have been decreased to some lower level, which may allow breakdown to occur
more easily in the future. This is a common mode of failure in high-voltage wiring: insulation
damage due to breakdown. Such failures may be detected through the use of special resistance
meters employing high voltage (1000 volts or more).
