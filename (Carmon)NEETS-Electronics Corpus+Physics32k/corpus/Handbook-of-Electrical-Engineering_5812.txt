Transformer windings, though magnetically coupled, are electrically isolated from each other. It is possible to
enhance certain performance characteristics for transformers by electrically interconnecting primary and sec-
ondary windings. Such devices are called autotransformers. The beneﬁts to be realized are lower cost, smaller
size and weight, higher efﬁciency, and better voltage regulation. The basic connection is illustrated in Fig. 64.9.
The issues will be demonstrated with an example.
