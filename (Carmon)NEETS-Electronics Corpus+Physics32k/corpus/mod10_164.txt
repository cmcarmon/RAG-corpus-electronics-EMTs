You have just seen that a light beam is reflected and diffused when it falls onto a piece of white
paper. If a light beam falls onto a piece of black paper, the black paper absorbs most of the light rays and
very little light is reflected from the paper. If the surface on which the light beam falls is perfectly black,
there is no reflection; that is, the light is totally absorbed. No matter what kind of surface light falls on,
however, some of the light is absorbed.
