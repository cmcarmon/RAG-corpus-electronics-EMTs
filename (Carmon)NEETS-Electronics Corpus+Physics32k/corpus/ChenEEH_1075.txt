Dozens of companies make and sell MEMS. Now that
MEMS devices are available in a greater variety and in large
numbers, it is possible for the applications engineer to incorp-
orate them in many different products. Most products are the
systems for which particular MEMS were designed, but others
are targets of opportunity. That is, the MEMS components are
simply devices that are available for incorporation into what-
ever systems can use them.
