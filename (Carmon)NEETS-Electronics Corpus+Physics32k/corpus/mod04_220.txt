Terminal Lugs—The terminals used in electrical wiring are either of the soldered or crimped type. 
The advantage of using a crimped type of connection is that it requires very little operator skill, whereas 
the soldered connection is almost completely dependent on the skill of the operator. Some form of 
insulation must be used with noninsulated splices and terminal lugs. The types used are clear plastic 
tubing (spaghetti) and heat-shrinkable tubing. When a heat gun is used to shrink the heat-shrinkable 
tubing, the maximum allowable heat to be used is 300º F. When using the compressed air/nitrogen 
heating tool, the air/nitrogen source cannot be greater than 200 psig.
