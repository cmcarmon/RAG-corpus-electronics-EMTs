For Reynolds number greater than 4000, the flow is turbulent; the resistance to flow follows the Darcyâ€“Weisbach equation: it is proportional to the square of the mean flow velocity. Over a domain of many orders of magnitude of Re (4000 < Re < 108), the friction factor varies less than one order of magnitude (0.006 < fD < 0.06). Within the turbulent flow regime, the nature of the flow can be further divided into a regime where the pipe wall is effectively smooth, and one where its roughness height is salient.
