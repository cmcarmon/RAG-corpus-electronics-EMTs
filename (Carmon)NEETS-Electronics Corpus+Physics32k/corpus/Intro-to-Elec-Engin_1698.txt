feed the information to the microcomputer. Actuators and sensors may be either analog or digital.
Digital-to-analog (D/A) converters are used to convert the digital signals to analog form so as to
suit the analog actuators, where as analog-to-digital (A/D) converters are employed to convert
the analog sensor signals to digital form so as to suit the microcomputer.
