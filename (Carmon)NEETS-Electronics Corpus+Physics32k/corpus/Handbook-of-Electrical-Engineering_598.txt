The transient approach can be computationally expensive for circuits that reach their periodic steady state
after a long simulation time. Results from the Fourier analysis are meaningful only in the periodic steady state,
and although this approach works well for large levels of distortion it is inaccurate for small distortion levels.
For small distortion levels accurate distortion analysis can be performed by use of the Volterra series method.
This  technique  is  a  generalization  of  the  power-series  method  and  is  useful  for  analyzing  harmonic  and
intermodulation  distortion  due  to  frequency-dependent  nonlinearities.  The  SPICE3  program  supports  this
analysis technique (in addition to the Fourier analysis of SPICE2) whereby the second and third harmonic and
intermodulation components can be efÔ¨Åciently obtained by three small-signal analyses of the circuit.
