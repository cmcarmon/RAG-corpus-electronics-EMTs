Therefore, the inventory of assigned test equipment on board ship is directly related to SCLSIS
records. Properly maintained SCLSIS records also show the complete inventory of test equipment on
board by quantity, serial number, and location. The SCLSIS program has two basic elements: (1)
VALIDATION, to establish a baseline data inventory, and (2) INVENTORY UPDATING, to correct
errors or omissions and to document configuration changes.
