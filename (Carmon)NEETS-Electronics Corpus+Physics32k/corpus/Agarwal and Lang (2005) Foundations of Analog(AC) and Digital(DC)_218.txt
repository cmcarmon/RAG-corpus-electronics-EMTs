Signals in the physical world are most commonly analog, that is, spanning
a continuum of values. Sound pressure is such a signal. The electromagnetic
signal picked up by a mobile phone antenna is another example of an analog
signal. Not surprisingly, most circuits that interact with the physical world must
be able to process analog signals.
