In 1862, Clausius stated what he calls the "theorem respecting the equivalence-values of the transformations" or what is now known as the second law of thermodynamics, as such:
The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be positive, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing.
Quantitatively, Clausius states the mathematical expression for this theorem is as follows. Let δQ be an element of the heat given up by the body to any reservoir of heat during its own changes, heat which it may absorb from a reservoir being here reckoned as negative, and T the absolute temperature of the body at the moment of giving up this heat, then the equation:




∫



δ
Q

T


=
0


{\displaystyle \int {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}=0}

must be true for every reversible cyclical process, and the relation:




∫



δ
Q

T


≥
0


{\displaystyle \int {\frac {\delta Q}{T}}\geq 0}

must hold good for every cyclical process which is in any way possible. This was an early formulation of the second law and one of the original forms of the concept of entropy.
