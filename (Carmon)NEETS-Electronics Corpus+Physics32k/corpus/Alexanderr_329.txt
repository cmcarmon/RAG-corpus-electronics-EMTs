We  carry  out  the  analysis  of  RC and  RL circuits  by  applying
Kirchhoff’s  laws,  as  we  did  for  resistive  circuits. The  only  difference
is  that  applying  Kirchhoff’s  laws  to  purely  resistive  circuits  results  in
algebraic equations, while applying the laws to RC and RL circuits pro-
duces  differential  equations,  which  are  more  difﬁcult  to  solve  than
algebraic  equations.  The  differential  equations  resulting  from  analyz-
ing  RC and  RL circuits  are  of  the  ﬁrst  order.  Hence,  the  circuits  are
collectively known as ﬁrst-order circuits.
