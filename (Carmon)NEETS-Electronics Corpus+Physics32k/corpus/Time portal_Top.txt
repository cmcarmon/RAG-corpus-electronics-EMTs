Time portals are doorways in time, employed in various fiction genres, especially science fiction and fantasy, to transport characters to the past or future.
They differ from time machines in being a permanent or semi-permanent fixture linking specific points in time, and thus are an especially useful plot device when the plot involves characters moving many times back and forth.
