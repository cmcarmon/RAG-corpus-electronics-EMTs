Parallelism and Pipelining Exploitation
One effective technique to reduce energy dissipation is to
reduce the supply voltage level by employing pipelining and
parallelism which has an immense effect in reducing the
overall power consumption and compensating for the resul-
tant speed loss. This technique is used in general for data path
sections. Assuming performance reduces by half when the
supply voltage is lowered, the hardware can be duplicated to
produce outputs at twice the slower rate to achieve the initial
performance before lowering the supply voltage level, as shown
in Figure 5.17.
