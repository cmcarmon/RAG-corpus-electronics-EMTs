The Cauchy momentum equation is a vector partial differential equation put forth by Cauchy that describes the non-relativistic momentum transport in any continuum. In convective (or Lagrangian) form it is written:

ρ


∇
⋅

σ

+

g



{\displaystyle {\frac {D\mathbf {u} }{Dt}}={\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}+\mathbf {g} }

where ρ is the density at the point considered in the continuum (for which the continuity equation holds), σ is the stress tensor, and g contains all of the body forces per unit mass (often simply gravitational acceleration). u is the flow velocity vector field, which depends on time and space.
Notably, it can be written, through an appropriate change of variables, also in conservation (or Eulerian) form:

F

s



{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {j} }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {F} =\mathbf {s} }

where j is the momentum density at the point considered in the continuum (for which the continuity equation holds), F is the flux associated to the momentum density, and s contains all of the body forces per unit volume.
