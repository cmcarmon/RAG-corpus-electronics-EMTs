If the sound speed is a minimum at a certain depth below
the surface, then this depth is called axis of the underwater
sound channel.2 The sound velocity increases both above and
below  this  axis.  When  the  sound  wave  travels  through  a
medium with a sound speed gradient, the direction of travel
of sound wave is bent towards the area of lower sound speed.
Although  the  deﬁnition  of  shallow  water  can  be  signal
dependent,  in  terms  of  depth-to-wavelength  ratio,  water
depth  of  less  than  1000  meters  is  generally  referred  to  as
shallow  water.  In  shallow  water  the  SVP  is  irregular  and
difﬁcult to predict because of large surface temperature and
salinity  variations,  wind  effects,  and  multiple  reﬂections  of
sound from the ocean bottom.
