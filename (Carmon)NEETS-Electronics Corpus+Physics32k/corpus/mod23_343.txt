biased positively or negatively). A digital one is recorded as a positive-going pulse: a digital zero is
recorded as a negative-going pulse. The magnetic tape returns to its neutral state in between pulses.
Figure 7-3 shows the magnetic tape in its neutral state. It also shows how the digital data word
0100110001 is stored onto the magnetic tape using return-to-zero encoding.
