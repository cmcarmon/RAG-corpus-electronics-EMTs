MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory), a product of The Math Works, Inc., is a software package
for high-performance numerical computation and visualization. It is simple, powerful, and
for most purposes quite fast with its easy-to-learn and easy-to-use language. It provides an
interactive environment with hundreds of built-in functions for technical computation, graphics,
and animation. MATLAB also provides easy extensibility with its own high-level programming
language.
