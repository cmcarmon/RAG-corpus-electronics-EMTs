The chemical reactions of some types of cells can be reversed by forcing electric current
backwards through the cell (in the negative electrode and out the positive electrode). This
process is called charging. Any such (rechargeable) cell is called a secondary cell. A cell whose
chemistry cannot be reversed by a reverse current is called a primary cell.
