. Phase-shift keying: In this technique, the phase of the
carrier signal is shifted to a certain degree of phase to
represent the binary value. In the simplest case, no shift
can represent the binary 0, while a shift of 1808 can
represent the binary 1. If a carrier signal can produce
four phases, such as no shift, shifting to 908, shifting to
