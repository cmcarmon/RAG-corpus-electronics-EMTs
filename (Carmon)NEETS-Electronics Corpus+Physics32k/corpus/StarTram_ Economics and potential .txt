The StarTram ground facility concept is claimed to be reusable after each launch without extensive maintenance, as it would essentially be a large linear synchronous electric motor. This would shift most of the "requirement for achieving orbit to a robust ground infrastructure," intended to have neither high performance relative to weight requirements nor such as the $25,000 per kilogram of flyable dry weight costs of the Space Shuttle. The designers estimate a construction cost for Generation 1 of $19 billion, becoming $67 billion for passenger-capable Generation 2.
The alternative Generation 1.5 design, such as 4 kilometres per second (2.5 mi/s) launch velocity, would be intermediate in velocity terms between Gen-1's 8.8 kilometres per second (5.5 mi/s) and the Maglifter design (which had $0.2 billion estimated cost for 0.3 kilometres per second (0.19 mi/s) launch assist in the case of a 50-ton vehicle).
The Generation 2 goal is $13,000 per person. Up to 4 million people could be sent to orbit per decade per Gen-2 facility if as estimated.
