The antenna coupler matches the impedance of a 15-, 25-, 28-, or 35-foot whip antenna to a 50-ohm 
transmission line at any frequency in the 2- to 30-megahertz range. Control signals from the associated 
antenna coupler control unit automatically tune the matching network in less than five seconds. During 
manual and silent operation, tuning is accomplished by the operator with the controls mounted on the 
antenna coupler control unit. A low power (not to exceed 250 watts) cw signal is required for tuning. 
Once tuned, the coupler is capable of handling 1,000 watts peak envelope power (pep).
