Phase: The angular relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit. The fraction of the period which
has elapsed in a periodic function or wave measured from some Ô¨Åxed origin. If the time for one period
is represented as 360(cid:176) along a time axis, the phase position is called phase angle.
