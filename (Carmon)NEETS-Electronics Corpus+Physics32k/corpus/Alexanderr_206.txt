The Thevenin equivalent is useful in Ô¨Ånding the maximum power
a linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust the
load  resistance 
If  the  entire  circuit  is  replaced  by  its  Thevenin
equivalent except for the load, as shown in Fig. 4.48, the power deliv-
ered to the load is
