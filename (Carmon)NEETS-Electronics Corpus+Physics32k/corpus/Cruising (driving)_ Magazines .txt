Cruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline. In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene â€“ preferring to concentrate on "dream" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.
