In Figure 17-12, the original 10 kΩ resistor in Figure 
17-11 is shown divided into two equal resistors, R1 and 
R2. This circuit still has the same total resistance as Fig-
ure 17-11 and therefore has the same amount of current 
flowing through it (i.e., 1 mA). Ohm’s law can be used 
to determine the voltage across each of the resistors.
