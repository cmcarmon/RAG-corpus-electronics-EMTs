Line coding is the process of arranging symbols that represent binary data in a particular pattern for
transmission. The most common types of line coding used in fiber optic communications include non-
return-to-zero (NRZ), return-to-zero (RZ), and biphase, or Manchester. Figure 8-6 illustrates NRZ, RZ,
and biphase (Manchester) encoding.
