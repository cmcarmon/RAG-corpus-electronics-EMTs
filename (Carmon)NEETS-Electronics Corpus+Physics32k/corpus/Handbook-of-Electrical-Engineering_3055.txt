small in magnitude and hence ideal for IC realization. A good account of SC ﬁlters is given, for example, in
Schaumann  et al.  [1990]  and  in  Taylor  and  Huang  [1997].  Commonly  encountered  techniques  for  SC  ﬁlter
design are based on the two major design styles (biquads and ladder simulation) that have been introduced in
this section.
