Figure 10.104 shows a buffer BUF1 driving a large load capacitor
CL. The buffer is built using an inverter pair as in Figure 10.94c. The width-to-length
ratio of each NMOS transistor in the buffer is W/L and the resistors have a value RL.
Accordingly, the gate capacitance seen at the input of the buffer is given by (W/L)CGS.
The buffer satisfies a static discipline with voltage thresholds given by VIL = VOL = VL
and VIH = VOH = VH. The supply voltage is VS. Assume that the internal buffer delay
(as defined in Problem 10.2c) is zero. Assume that there is a 0 to 1 transition at the input
A at time t = 0.
