Figure 115.16 shows a block diagram of the key components of a typical ICD pulse generator. The brain of
the ICD is the microprocessor. Most ICD manufacturers use industry-standard microprocessors, such as the
Z80, 6502, or 8852, to control the ICD [Warren et al., 1996]. In order to conserve energy, it is desirable to put
the microprocessor into a sleep mode as often as possible and to wake it only when necessary, such as when
an arrhythmia is suspected. To accomplish this, many of the monitoring and pacing functions are implemented
using analog and digital circuits. Modern ICD designs have reduced the size of the circuitry to a small number
of integrated circuits on a hybrid chip [Warren et al., 1996].
