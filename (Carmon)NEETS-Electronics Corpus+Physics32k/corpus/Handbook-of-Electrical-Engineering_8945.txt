The smaller the shaft the more rapid its rotation for a given
mouse velocity. Another form of the ball-and-shaft mouse is
the one that uses an optical interrupter, as shown in Fig. 89.8.
In this form, the light from the light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
is interrupted by the coded disks that are rotated by the shafts,
and is then picked up by the phototransistors and converted
into  the  digital  signal  that  represents  the  disk  rotation.  An
optical interrupter is also used for the optomechanical mouse,
and here the interrupter contains a set of slots; as the inter-
rupter rotates quadrature signals are created that correspond
to the shaft rotation.
