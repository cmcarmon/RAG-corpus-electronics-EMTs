On the other hand, physical circuit elements can be readily found that well approximate the ideal, but
they will always deviate from the ideal in some way. For example, a ﬂashlight battery, like a C-cell, roughly
corresponds to a 1.5 V voltage source. However, it ceases to be modeled by a voltage source capable of
supplying any current (that’s what ideal ones can do!) when the resistance of the light bulb is too small.
3.4 Electric Circuits and Interconnection Laws10
A circuit connects circuit elements together in a speciﬁc conﬁguration designed to transform the source
signal (originating from a voltage or current source) into another signal—the output—that corresponds to
the current or voltage deﬁned for a particular circuit element. A simple resistive circuit is shown in Figure 3.6.
This circuit is the electrical embodiment of a system having its input provided by a source system producing
vin (t).
