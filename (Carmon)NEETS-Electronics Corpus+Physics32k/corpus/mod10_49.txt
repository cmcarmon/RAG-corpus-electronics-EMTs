A WAVE can be defined as a DISTURBANCE (sound, light, radio waves) that moves through a
MEDIUM (air, water, vacuum). To help you understand what is meant by "a disturbance which moves
through a medium," picture the following illustration. You are standing in the middle of a wheat field. As
the wind blows across the field toward you, you can see the wheat stalks bending and rising as the force
of the wind moves into and across them. The wheat appears to be moving toward you, but it isnâ€™t. Instead,
the stalks are actually moving back and forth. We can then say that the "medium" in this illustration is the
wheat and the "disturbance" is the wind moving the stalks of wheat.
