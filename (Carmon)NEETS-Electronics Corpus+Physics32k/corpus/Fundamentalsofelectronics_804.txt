To determine the noise power, we must understand how the coherent demodulator aﬀects the bandpass
noise found in ˜r (t). Because we are concerned with noise, we must deal with the power spectrum since we
don’t have the Fourier transform available to us. Letting P (f ) denote the power spectrum of ˜r (t)’s noise
component, the power spectrum after multiplication by the carrier has the form
