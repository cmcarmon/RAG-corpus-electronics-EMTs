The signal source has been represented by a Th√©venin equivalent that applies a signal via a coupling capacitor
Cc. Note that this signal source has been returned to the emitter, which implies that the emitter resistor bypass
capacitor CE has been treated as a short circuit at all signal frequencies for the purposes of this analysis.
