A typical schematic diagram is shown in view (B). The positive pulses from the counter are filtered 
by C2, R2, and C3. The positive dc voltage from the filter is applied to the input of amplifier A. This 
voltage increases with frequency; as a consequence, the current through the device increases. Since 
emitter or cathode current flows through M1, an increase in amplifier current causes an increase in meter 
deflection. The meter may be calibrated in units of time, frequency, revolutions per minute, or any 
function based upon the relationship of output voltage to input frequency.
