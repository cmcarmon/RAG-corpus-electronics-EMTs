The dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], d) can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(φ/2) + sin(φ/2)S that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector d, given by D = d1i + d2j + d3k. Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], d) is given by

{\displaystyle {\hat {x}}=\mathbf {x} +\varepsilon \mathbf {p} \times \mathbf {x} \quad {\text{and}}\quad {\hat {X}}=\mathbf {X} +\varepsilon \mathbf {P} \times \mathbf {X} .}

Then the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Plücker coordinates in the moving frame to Plücker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula
