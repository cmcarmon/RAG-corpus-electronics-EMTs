Values of dependent sources depend on the voltage or
current of some other element or elements in the circuit.
There are four classes of dependent sources: (1) voltage-
controlled voltage source,
(2) current-controlled voltage
source, (3) voltage-controlled current source and (4) current-
controlled current
these
dependent sources are shown in Table 1.1.
