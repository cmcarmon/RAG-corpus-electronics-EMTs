This law is also called Kirchhoff's second law, Kirchhoff's loop (or mesh) rule, and Kirchhoff's second rule.
The principle of conservation of energy implies that
The directed sum of the electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed network is zero, or:
More simply, the sum of the emfs in any closed loop is equivalent to the sum of the potential drops in that loop, or:
The algebraic sum of the products of the resistances of the conductors and the currents in them in a closed loop is equal to the total emf available in that loop.

Similar to KCL, it can be stated as:





∑

k
=
1


n



V

k


=
0


{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}V_{k}=0}

Here, n is the total number of voltages measured. The voltages may also be complex:





∑

k
=
1


n






V
~




k


=
0


{\displaystyle \sum _{k=1}^{n}{\tilde {V}}_{k}=0}

This law is based on the conservation of energy whereby voltage is defined as the energy per unit charge. The total amount of energy gained per unit charge must be equal to the amount of energy lost per unit charge, as energy and charge are both conserved.
