where A is the open-loop voltage gain. Thus, the op amp is basically a form of differen-
tial ampliﬁer, in which the difference vp − vn is ampliﬁed. For an output voltage on the
order of 12 V, the difference voltage vd is on the order of 0.12 mV, or 120 µV. The input
impedance Zi is on the order of 1 M, while the output impedance Zo is on the order of 100
 to 1 k.
