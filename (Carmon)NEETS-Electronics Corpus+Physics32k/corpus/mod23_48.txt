From the beginning, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratories (NRL) saw great potential in magnetic
recording. They were especially interested in using it to transmit telegraph signals at high speed. After
electronic amplifiers were invented around 1925, W.L. Carlson and G.W. Carpenter at the NRL made the
next important magnetic recording discovery. They found that adding an ac bias voltage to the input
signal instead of a fixed dc bias voltage would
