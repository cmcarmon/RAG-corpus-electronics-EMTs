Crystal oscillators are those in which a specially-cut crystal controls the frequency. CRYSTAL-
CONTROLLED OSCILLATORS are the standard means used for maintaining the frequency of radio 
transmitting stations within their assigned frequency limits. A crystal-controlled oscillator is usually used 
to produce an output which is highly stable and at a very precise frequency.
