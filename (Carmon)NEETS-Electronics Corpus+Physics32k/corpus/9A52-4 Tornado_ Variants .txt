The 9A52-4 Tornado system is a lightweight rocket launcher. There are two other systems; a modular MLRS based on the MZKT-79306 truck, which can carry two BM-27 Uragan or BM-30 Smerch launcher modules, and one based on the Kamaz 6x6 truck. The "Tornado-G" system is an upgrade package for the existing BM-21 Grad. The Russian government ordered 36 new "Tornado-G" based on the Kamaz 6x6 chassis, instead of the old systems based on the Ural-4320 truck.
9A52-4 should not be confused with other systems in the similarly denoted Tornado family:
9A53-G Tornado (2x15 1x40 122mm Upgraded BM-21 Grad Multiple Rocket Launcher Module, based on a Kamaz Truck or on a Ural-4320).
9A53-U Tornado (2x8 2x6 220mm Upgraded BM-27 Uragan Multiple Rocket Launcher Modules, based on a MZKT-79306).
9A53-S Tornado (2x6 2x4 300mm Upgraded BM-30 Smerch Multiple Rocket Launcher Modules, based on a MZKT-79306).
