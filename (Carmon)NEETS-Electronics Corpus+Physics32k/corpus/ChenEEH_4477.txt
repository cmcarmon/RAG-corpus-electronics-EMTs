Here w(t) and v(t) are vector Brownian motions. The meaning
of a Brownian motion, such as w(t), can be given directly or in
terms of its differential dw(t). In the latter case, the dw(t) is a
Gaussian random process with zero mean, covariance matrix
W dt, and independent increments. A similar description ap-
plies to dv(t), with covariance V dt. It is assumed that dw(t)
and dv(t) are independent. The matrices A, B, C, and E are of
compatible size. It should be remarked that the formalism of
equation 5.1 is that of a stochastic differential equation. Intui-
tively, one thinks of dividing both sides of this equation by dt
to obtain the more colloquial form. But the formal derivative
of a Brownian motion—which is known as white noise—is not
a well-deﬁned random process, and this motivates an alternate
way of thinking.
