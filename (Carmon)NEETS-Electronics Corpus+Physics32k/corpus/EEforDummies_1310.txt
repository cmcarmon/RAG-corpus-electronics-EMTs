breadboard: Also known as prototyping board or solderless breadboard; a rect­
angular plastic board (available in a variety of sizes) that contains groups of 
electrically interconnected contact holes. You plug in components — resistors, 
capacitors, diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, for example — and then 
string wires to build a circuit. See also solder breadboard.
