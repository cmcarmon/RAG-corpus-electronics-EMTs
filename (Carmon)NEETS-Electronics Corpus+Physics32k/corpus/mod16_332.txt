The formula for determining the resistance of the shunt is given by Rs = Im /Is times Rm, where Rs is
the shunt resistance in ohms; Im is the meter current at full-scale deflection; Is is the shunt current at full-
scale deflection; and Rm  is the resistance of the meter coil. If the values given in the previous example are
used in this equation, it will yield 5.55 ohms, the value previously calculated.
