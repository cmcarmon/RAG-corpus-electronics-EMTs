n o i s e m a r g i n s Disco Systems Inc. has been having intermittent faults in its
systems. Their system architects figure out that because the static discipline they have
adopted does not provide a sufficient noise margin, their systems are susceptible to
noise. To improve the noise immunity of their systems, they decide to upgrade their
systems to a new static discipline in which the output high voltage threshold is increased
by 0.5 V, and the output low voltage threshold is decreased by 0.5 V. Both the input
voltage thresholds remain unchanged. In other words, the improved static discipline has
the following voltage thresholds:
