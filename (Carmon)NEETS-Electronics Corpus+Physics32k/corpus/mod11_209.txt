A circulator is a waveguide device that allows energy to travel in one direction only, as shown in 
figure 2-41. The tunnel diode in figure 2-41 is connected across a tuned-input circuit. This arrangement 
normally produces feedback that causes oscillations if the feedback is allowed to reflect back to the tuned-
input circuit. The feedback is prevented because the circulator carries all excess energy to the absorptive 
load (R L). In this configuration the tunnel diode cannot oscillate, but will amplify.
