The second aspect of the nonuniqueness issue relates not to order, i.e., the number of state variables, but to
choice of internal variables (state variables). Mathematical and physical methods of selecting state variables are
available  [Brogan,  1991]. An  inÔ¨Ånite  number  of  choices  exist,  and  each  leads  to  a  different  set  {A,  B,  C,  D},
called a realization. Some state variable model forms are more convenient for revealing key system properties
such  as  stability,  controllability,  observability,  stabilizability,  and  detectability.  Common  forms  include  the
controllable  canonical  form,  the  observable  canonical  form,  the  Jordan  canonical  form,  and  the  Kalman
canonical form.
