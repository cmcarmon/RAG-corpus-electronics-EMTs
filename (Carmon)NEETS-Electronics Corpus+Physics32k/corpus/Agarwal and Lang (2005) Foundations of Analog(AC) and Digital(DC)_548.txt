To solve, find the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit facing R5, that is, the circuit shown
in Figure 3.90b. The circuit now consists of two independent voltage dividers connected
across a common voltage source V. The layout of the dividers is not quite as straight-
forward as in Figure 2.36 but, topologically, they are the same. Hence we can calculate
the two voltage-dividers’ voltages va and vb by inspection; then subtract to find voc.
