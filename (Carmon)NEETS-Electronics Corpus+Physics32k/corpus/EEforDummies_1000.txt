Analog electronic components
Analog components control the flow of continuous (analog) electrical signals. 
Table 14-1 shows the circuit symbols used for basic analog electronic com-
ponents. The third column in the table provides the chapter reference in this 
book where you can find detailed information about the functionality of each 
component.
