where the summed terms represent the thermal resistances of the individual layers of silicon, solder, copper,
alumina, etc. It is to be noted that the contact resistances that occur at the interfaces between pairs of materials
can be added, as appropriate, to this summation. As may be seen in Fig. 32.2, decreasing the thickness of each
layer and/or increasing the thermal conductivity and cross-sectional area, reduce the resistance of the individual
layers.
