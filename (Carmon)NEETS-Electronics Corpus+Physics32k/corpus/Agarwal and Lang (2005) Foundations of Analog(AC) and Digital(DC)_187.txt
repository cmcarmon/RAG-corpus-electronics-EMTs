is the element law for the resistor. The element law is also referred to as the
constituent relation, or the element relation. In order to standardize the manner
in which element laws are expressed, the current and voltage for all two-terminal
elements are defined according to the associated variables convention shown in
Figure 1.19. Figure 1.28 shows a plot of the v i relationship for a resistor when
v and i are defined according to the associated variables convention.
