There are three primary types of lightning, defined by what is at the "ends" of a flash channel.
Intracloud (IC), which occurs within a single thundercloud unit
Cloud to cloud (CC) or intercloud, which starts and ends between two different "functional" thundercloud units
Cloud to ground (CG), that primarily originates in the thundercloud and terminates on an Earth surface, but may also occur in the reverse direction, that is ground to cloud
There are variations of each type, such as "positive" versus "negative" CG flashes, that have different physical characteristics common to each which can be measured. Different common names used to describe a particular lightning event may be attributed to the same or different events.
