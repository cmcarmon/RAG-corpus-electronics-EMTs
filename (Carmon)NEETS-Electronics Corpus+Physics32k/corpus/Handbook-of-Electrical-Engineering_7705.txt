The ST506 is a low-cost but primitive interface, most appropriate for interfacing ﬂoppy disks to personal
computers and low-end workstations. For example, the controller must perform data separation on its own;
this is not done for it by the disk device. As a result, its transfer rate is limited to 0.625 Mbytes/s. The SMD
interface is higher performance and is used extensively in connecting disks to mainframe disk controllers. ESDI
is similar, but geared more towards smaller disk systems. One of its innovations over the ST506 is its ability to
specify a seek to a particular track number rather than requiring track positioning via step-by-step pulses. Its
performance  is  in  the  range  of  1.25–1.875  Mbytes/s.  SCSI  has  so  far  been  used  primarily  with  workstations
and minicomputers, but offers the highest degree of integration and intelligence. Implementations with per-
formance at the level of 1.5–4 Mbytes/s are common. The newer IPI-3 standard has the advantages of SCSI,
but provides even higher performance at a higher cost. It is beginning to make inroads into mainframe systems.
However, because of the very widespread use of SCSI, many believe that SCSI-2, an extension of SCSI to wider
signal paths, will become the de facto standard for high-performance small disks.
