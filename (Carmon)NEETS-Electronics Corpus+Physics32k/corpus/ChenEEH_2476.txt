Array Side Lobe Level
The peak value of the normalized array factor AFn(u, f) is
unity, which occurs at c ¼ 0 corresponding to the main direc-
tion of radiation. The next peak of AFn occurs approximately
at N c=2 ¼ 1:5p, where AFn ¼ 1
. This corresponds to the
ﬁrst side lobe level (SLL) of the array factor. For an array with
large number of elements N , this level can be shown to be
independent of N :
