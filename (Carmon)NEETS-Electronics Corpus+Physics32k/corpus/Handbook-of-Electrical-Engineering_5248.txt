More than 500 nuclear power plants operate around the world. Close to 300 operate pressurized water reactors
(PWRs), more than 100 are built with boiling-water reactors (BWRs), about 50 use gas-cooled reactors, and
the rest are heavy-water reactors. In addition a few fast breeder reactors are in operation. These reactors are
built for better utilization of uranium fuel. The modern nuclear plant size varies from 100 to 1200 MW.
