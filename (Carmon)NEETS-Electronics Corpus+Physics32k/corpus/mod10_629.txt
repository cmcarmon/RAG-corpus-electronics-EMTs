Some antenna sources radiate energy equally in all directions. Radiation of this type is known as 
ISOTROPIC RADIATION. We all know the Sun radiates energy in all directions. The energy radiated 
from the Sun measured at any fixed distance and from any angle will be approximately the same. Assume 
that a measuring device is moved around the Sun and stopped at the points indicated in figure 4-9 to make 
a measurement of the amount of radiation. At any point around the circle, the distance from the measuring 
device to the Sun is the same. The measured radiation will also be the same. The Sun is therefore 
considered an isotropic radiator.
