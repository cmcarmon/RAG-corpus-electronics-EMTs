An amplifier biased into Class A operation, is one in which conduction through the tube occurs
throughout the duration of the input signal. Such an amplifier is shown in figure 1-27, view A. This is the
same type of circuit with which you are already familiar. Notice when you compare the input to the
output that the tube is always conducting, and that the entire input signal is reproduced at the output.
