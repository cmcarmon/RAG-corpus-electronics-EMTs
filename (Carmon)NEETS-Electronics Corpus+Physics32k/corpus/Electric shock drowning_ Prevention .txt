Beyond ensuring that all electrical hookups on docks and boats in the vicinity are code compliant and safe, various precautions can be taken by the swimmer. The primary method is to swim at a safe distance from all electrically active devices. One source recommends keeping a distance of at least 100 yards from freshwater marinas while swimming.
Although sensors exist that can detect leakage current in the water, these are unsuitable to use as an alarm device. These instruments provide no advanced warning before a problem starts. If a hazard condition is created, swimmers will be affected at the same time the instrument detects the current. It is common for faults to be tied to appliances or circuits that come on intermittently, meaning that the condition of the water can change instantly and unpredictably.
The best strategy for avoiding electrical hazards is to swim in designated areas well away from any devices that present a risk.
