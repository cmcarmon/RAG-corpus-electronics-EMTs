improved test methodologies, be used to provide input data for
these new CAD tools. With these data and smart reliability CAD
tools, the impact on product reliability of design selections can
be evaluated. New CAD tools need to be developed that can
calculate degradation in electrical performance of the circuit
over time. The inputs used would be the predicted resistance
increases in interconnect wires and vias in the circuit based on
the following:
