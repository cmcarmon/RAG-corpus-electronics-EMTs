All of the above functions have useful applications. For pulse timing, the period function is used; 
totalizing is used in digital applications; and ratio is used in comparing harmonic-related signals. Scaling 
is used for triggering other test equipment used in conjunction with the frequency counter; and time-
interval capability is used in measuring the interval between two pulses or between two sets of pulses. 
Because of the wide variety of frequency counters in use, the technical manual for a specific frequency 
counter should be consulted to determine the instrument's full capabilities.
