A strength of optical recording is that, unlike its magnetic counterpart, it can support read-only, write-once,
and erasable/rewritable modes of data storage. Consider, for example, the technology of optical audio/video
disks. Here the information is recorded on a master disk which is then used as a stamper to transfer the embossed
patterns to a plastic substrate for rapid, accurate, and inexpensive reproduction. The same process is employed
in the mass production of read-only ﬁles (CD-ROM, O-ROM) which are now being used to distribute software,
catalogues, and other large databases. Or consider the write-once read-many (WORM) technology, where one
can permanently store massive amounts of information on a given medium and have rapid, random access to
them afterwards. The optical drive can be designed to handle read-only, WORM, and erasable media all in one
unit, thus combining their useful features without sacriﬁcing performance and ease of use or occupying too
