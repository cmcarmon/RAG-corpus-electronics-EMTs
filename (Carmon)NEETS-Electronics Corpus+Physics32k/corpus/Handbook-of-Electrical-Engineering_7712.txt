FIGURE 80.13  Elements of the Cray I/O system for the Y-MP. An IOS contains up to four IOPs. The MIOP connects to
the operator workstation and performs mainly maintenance functions. The XIOP supports block multiplexing and is most
appropriate for controlling relatively slow speed devices, such as tapes. The BIOP and DIOP are designed for controlling
high-speed devices like disks. Up to four disk storage units (DSUs) can be attached through the disk control unit (DCU)
to the IOP. Three DCUs can be connected to each of the BIOP and DIOP, leading to a total of 24 disks per IOS. The Y-MP
can be conÔ¨Ågured with two IOSs, for a system total of 48 devices.
