The stator phase windings may be connected in either wye (also known as star or symbolically
represented as Y) or delta (also known as mesh or symbolically represented as ), as shown
schematically in Figure 4.1.3. Almost all ac generators (otherwise known as alternators) have
their stator phase windings connected in wye. By connecting together either all three primed
terminals or all three unprimed terminals to form the neutral of the wye, a wye connection
results. If a neutral conductor is brought out, the system is known as a four-wire, three-phase
system; otherwise it is a three-wire, three-phase system. A delta connection is effected for the
to a. The generator
armature of the generator by connecting terminals a
terminals A, B, C (and sometimes N for a wye connection) are brought out as shown in Figure
4.1.3. In the delta-connection, no neutral exists, and hence only a three-wire, three-phase system
can be formed. Note that a phase is one of the three branch circuits making up a three-phase circuit.
In a wye connection, a phase consists of those circuit elements connected between one line and
neutral; in a delta circuit, a phase consists of those circuit elements connected between two lines.
