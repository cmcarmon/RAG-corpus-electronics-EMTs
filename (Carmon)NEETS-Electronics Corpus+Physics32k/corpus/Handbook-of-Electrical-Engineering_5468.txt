There are now two truly multiterminal dc systems in operation. The Sardinia–Corsica–Italy three-terminal
dc  system  was  originally  commissioned  as  a  two-terminal  (Sardinia–Italy)  system  in  1967  with  a  200-MW
rating. In 1986, the Corsica tap was added and the system was upgraded to a 300-MW rating. The two-terminal
Hydro Quebec–New England HVDC interconnection (commissioned in 1985) was extended to a ﬁve-terminal
system and commissioned in 1990 (see Table 61.4). The largest terminal of this system at Radisson station in
Quebec is rated at 2250 MW. Two more systems, the Nelson River system in Canada and the Paciﬁc NW-SW
Intertie in the United States, also operate as multiterminal systems. Each of these systems has two converters
at  each  end  of  the  line,  but  the  converters  at  each  end  are  constrained  to  operate  in  the  same  mode,  either
rectiﬁer or inverter.
