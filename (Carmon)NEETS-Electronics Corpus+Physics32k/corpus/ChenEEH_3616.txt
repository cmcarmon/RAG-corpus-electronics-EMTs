Solution
This example applied to the functions seen in Figure 2.19
is depicted in Figure 2.20. The results are for the least-squares
and minimax approaches and for
the WLS-Chebyshev
ﬁlter where v0
L was chosen as the fourth extreme in the
ﬁlter’s stopband. The order of all ﬁlters is 40. Compared with
the ﬁlters designed by the window methods, the WLS, WLS-
Chebyshev, and the minimax ﬁlters are much more econom-
ical. The reader should note that the passband ripple speciﬁed
here is 10 times smaller than the value used in the window
example.
