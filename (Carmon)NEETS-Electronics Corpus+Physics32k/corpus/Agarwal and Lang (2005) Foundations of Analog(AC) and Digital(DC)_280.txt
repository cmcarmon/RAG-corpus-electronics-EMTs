Finally, it is important to recognize that voltage sources can be used to con-
struct circuits in which KVL is violated. Several examples of circuits constructed
from voltage sources in which KVL is violated around every loop are shown
in Figure 2.20. As with circuits that violate KCL, we will not be concerned
with circuits that violate KVL, for two reasons. First, if KVL does not hold
around a loop, then magnetic flux linkage will accumulate through that loop.
This is inconsistent with the constraint of the lumped matter discipline that
dB/dt = 0 outside the elements. Second, if a circuit were actually built to vio-
late KVL, something would ultimately give. For example, the voltage sources
might cease to function as ideal sources as they oppose one another. Alterna-
tively, the loop inductance might begin to accumulate flux linkage, leading to
high currents that would damage the voltage sources or their interconnections.
In any case, the behavior of the real circuit would not be well modeled by the
type of circuit shown in Figure 2.20, and so there is no reason to study the
latter.
