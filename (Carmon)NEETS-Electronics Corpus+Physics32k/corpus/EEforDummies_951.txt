adjustable temperature control, dial the recommended setting for the 
kind of solder that you’re using. Too much heat can spoil a good circuit.
▶✓ Never solder a live circuit (a circuit to which you’ve applied voltage). 
You may damage the circuit or the soldering iron — and you may receive 
a nasty shock.
