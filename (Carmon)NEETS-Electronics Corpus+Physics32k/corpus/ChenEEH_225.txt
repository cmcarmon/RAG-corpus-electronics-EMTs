Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions
Circuits with nonlinear elements may have multiple discrete dc
operating points (equilibriums). In contrast, circuits consist-
ing of positive linear resistors possess either one dc operating
point or, in special cases, a continuous family of dc operating
points. Many resistive circuits consisting of independent volt-
age sources and voltage-controlled resistors, whose v–i relation
characteristics are continuous strictly monotone-increasing
functions, have at most one solution (Dufﬁn, 1947; Minty,
1960; Willson, 1975). Many transistor circuits possess the
same property based on their topology alone. Other circuits,
such as ﬂip-ﬂops and memory cells, possess feedback struc-
tures (Nielsen and Willson, 1980). These circuits may possess
multiple operating points with an appropriate choice of circuit
parameters and biasing of transistors (Trajkovic´ and Willson,
1992). For example, a circuit containing two bipolar transis-
tors possesses at most three isolated dc operating points (Lee
and Willson, 1983). Estimating the number of dc operating
points or even their upper bounds for an arbitrary nonlinear
circuit is still an open problem (Lagarias and Trajkovic´, 1999).
