Figure  5.5(a)  shows  a  junction  diode  in  which 
the  anode  is  made  positive  with  respect  to  the 
cathode.  In  this  forward-biased  condition,  the 
diode  freely  passes  current.  Figure  5.5(b)  shows  a 
diode with the cathode made positive  with respect 
to the cathode. In this reverse-biased condition, the 
diode passes a negligible amount of current. In the 
freely  conducting  forward-biased  state,  the  diode 
acts  rather  like  a  closed  switch.  In  the  reverse-
biased state, the diode acts like an open switch. 
 
If  a  positive  voltage  is  applied  to  the  P-type 
material,  the  free  positive  charge  carriers  will  be 
repelled and they will move away from the positive 
potential 
the 
negative  potential  applied  to  the  N-type  material 
will cause the free negative charge carriers to move 
away  from  the  negative  potential  towards  the 
junction. 
  When  the  positive  and  negative  charge  carriers 
arrive at the junction, they will attract one another 
and combine (recall that unlike charges attract). As 
each  negative  and  positive  charge  carrier  combine 
at the junction, a new negative and positive charge 
carrier  will  be  introduced  to  the  semiconductor 
material  from  the  voltage  source.  As  these  new 
charge  carriers  enter  the  semiconductor  material, 
they  will  move  toward  the  junction  and  combine. 
Thus,  current  flow  is  established  and  it  will 
continue for as long as the voltage is applied. 
  As stated earlier, the forward threshold voltage 
must  be  exceeded  before  the  diode  will  conduct.
