A very useful property of transformers is the ability to transform voltage and current levels
according to a simple ratio, determined by the ratio of input and output coil turns. If the
energized coil of a transformer is energized by an AC voltage, the amount of AC voltage induced
in the unpowered coil will be equal to the input voltage multiplied by the ratio of output to
input wire turns in the coils. Conversely, the current through the windings of the output coil
compared to the input coil will follow the opposite ratio: if the voltage is increased from input
