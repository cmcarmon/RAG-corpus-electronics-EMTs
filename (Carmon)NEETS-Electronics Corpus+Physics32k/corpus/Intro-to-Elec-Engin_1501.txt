Digital Signal Formatting
After quantization and coding the samples of the message, a suitable waveform has to be chosen
to represent the bits. This waveform can then be transmitted directly over the channel (if no carrier
modulation is involved), or used for carrier modulation. The waveform selection process is known
as formatting the digital sequence. Three kinds of waveforms are available:
