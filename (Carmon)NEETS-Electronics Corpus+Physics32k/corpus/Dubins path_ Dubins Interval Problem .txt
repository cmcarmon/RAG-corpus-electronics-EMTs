Dubins interval problem is a key variant of the Dubins path problem, where an interval of heading directions are specified at the initial and terminal points. The tangent direction of the path at initial and final points are constrained to lie with in the specified intervals. One could solve this using geometrical analysis, or using Pontryagin's minimum principle.
