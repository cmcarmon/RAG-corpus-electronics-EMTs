The KdV equation is a nonlinear, dispersive partial differential equation for a function

of two real variables, space x and time t :

with ∂x and ∂t denoting partial derivatives with respect to x and t.
The constant 6 in front of the last term is conventional but of no great significance: multiplying t, x, and
