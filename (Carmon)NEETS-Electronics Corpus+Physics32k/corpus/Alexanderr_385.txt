The coil circuit is an RL circuit like that in Fig. 7.77(b), where R and
L are  the  resistance  and  inductance  of  the  coil.  When  switch 
in
Fig. 7.77(a)  is  closed,  the  coil  circuit  is  energized.  The  coil  current
gradually increases and produces a magnetic ﬁeld. Eventually the mag-
netic ﬁeld is sufﬁciently strong to pull the movable contact in the other
circuit and close switch 
At this point, the relay is said to be pulled
in.  The  time  interval 
is
td
called the relay delay time.
