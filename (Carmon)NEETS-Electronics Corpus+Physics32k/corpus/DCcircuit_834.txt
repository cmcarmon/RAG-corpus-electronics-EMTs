Here, the 1 kΩ potentiometer, connected as a rheostat, provides by itself a 1 kΩ span (a
range of 0 Ω to 1 kΩ). Connected in series with an 8 kΩ resistor, this offsets the total resistance
by 8,000 Ω, giving an adjustable range of 8 kΩ to 9 kΩ. Now, a precision of +/- 1 Ω represents
1 part in 1000, or 1/10 of a percent of potentiometer shaft motion. This is ten times better, in
terms of adjustment sensitivity, than what we had using a 10 kΩ potentiometer.
