Consider first the series combination of two capacitors as shown in Figure 9.15;
we will assume here that the two capacitors were uncharged at the time of their
connection. Since the two capacitors share a common current, it follows from
Equation 9.11 that they store a common charge q, as shown in Figure 9.15.
Thus, following Equation 9.8,
