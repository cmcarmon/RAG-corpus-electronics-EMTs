ATTRACTION/REPULSION. The intensity of attraction or repulsion between magnetic poles may
be described by a law almost identical to Coulombâ€™s Law of Charged Bodies. The force between two
poles is directly proportional to the product of the pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between the poles.
