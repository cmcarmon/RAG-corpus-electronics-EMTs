At this point C2 begins to discharge, decreasing the negative potential at the top of L2 (potential will 
swing in the positive direction). As the negative potential applied to the base of Q1 decreases, the 
opposition to the forward bias also decreases. This, in effect, causes the forward bias to begin increasing, 
resulting in increased emitter current flowing through L1. The increase in current through L1 causes 
additional energy to be fed to the tank circuit to replace lost energy. If the energy lost in the tank is 
replaced with an equal or larger amount of energy, oscillations will be sustained. The oscillator has now 
completed 1 cycle and will continue to repeat it over and over again.
