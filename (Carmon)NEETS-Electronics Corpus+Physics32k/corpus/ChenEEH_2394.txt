The unknown parameters a, b, g, and a, as well as the rota-
tional parameter z, can be solved in terms of ru and rf, using
the pair of complex equations 6.31 and 6.32. The g is called the
tilt angle, a the major axis, b the minor axis, and a the phase of
the ellipse. The ratio of the major and minor axes is called the
axial ratio (AR):
