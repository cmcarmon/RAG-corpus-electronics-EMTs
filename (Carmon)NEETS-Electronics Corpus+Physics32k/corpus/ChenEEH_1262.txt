. Main memory is external memory that is relatively fast
and inexpensive. The information stored in the main
memory is data and instructions still actively used. The
storage capacity of main memory (often from 1 to
1000 MB [1 MB is 220 bytes]) is much larger than that
of cache memory. The access time (Ô¨Åve or more cycles),
however, is also much slower than cache memory.
