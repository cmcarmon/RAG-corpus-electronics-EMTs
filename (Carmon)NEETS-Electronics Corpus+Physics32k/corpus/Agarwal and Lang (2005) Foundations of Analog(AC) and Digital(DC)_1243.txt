The latter equality shows that q(t1) perfectly summarizes, or memorizes, the
entire accumulated history of i(t) for t ≤ t1. Thus,
it is
necessary and sufficient to know i only over the interval t1 ≤ t ≤ t2 in order
to determine q(t2). For this reason, q is referred to as the state of the capacitor.
For linear time-invariant capacitors, v can also easily serve as a state because
v is proportionally related to q through the constant C. Accordingly, we can
rewrite Equation 9.12 as
