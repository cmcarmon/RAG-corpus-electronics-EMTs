Let's look at the multivibrator in figure 3-3 again. This is an astable multivibrator. The astable 
multivibrator is said to oscillate. To understand why the astable multivibrator oscillates, assume that 
transistor Q1 saturates and transistor Q2 cuts off when the circuit is energized. This situation is shown in 
figure 3-4. We assume Q1 saturates and Q2 is in cutoff because the circuit is symmetrical; that is, 
R1 = R4, R2 = R3, C1 = C2, and Q1 = Q2. It is impossible to tell which transistor will actually conduct 
when the circuit is energized. For this reason, either of the transistors may be assumed to conduct for 
circuit analysis purposes.
