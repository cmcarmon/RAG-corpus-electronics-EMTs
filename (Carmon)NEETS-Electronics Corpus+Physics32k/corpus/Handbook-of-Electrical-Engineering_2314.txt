Schottky Barrier Diode
The  Schottky  barrier  diode  is  a  metal-semiconductor  diode.  Majority  carriers  carry  the  electric  current.  No
minority carrier injection takes place. When the diode is forward biased, carriers are injected into the metal,
where they reside as majority carriers at an energy level that is higher than the Fermi level in metals. The I-V
characteristic is similar to conventional diodes. The barrier voltage is small, about 0.2 V for silicon. Since no
minority carrier charge exists, the Schottky barrier diodes are very fast. They are used in high-speed electronic
circuitry.
