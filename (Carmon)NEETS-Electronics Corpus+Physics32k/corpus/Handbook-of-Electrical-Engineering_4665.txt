Finally, the last term of the SAW transducer’s equivalent circuit is the frequency-dependent susceptance. Given
any  system  where  the  frequency-dependent  real  part  is  known,  there  is  an  associated  imaginary  part  which
must exist for the system to be real and causal. This is given by the Hilbert transform susceptance, deﬁned as
Ba, where [Datta, 1986]
