The construction of a JFET is shown in figure 3-45. A solid bar, made either of N-type or P-type 
material, forms the main body of the device. Diffused into each side of this bar are two deposits of 
material of the opposite type from the bar material, which form the "gate." The portion of the bar between 
the deposits of gate material is of a smaller cross section than the rest of the bar and forms a "channel" 
connecting the source and the drain. Figure 3-45 shows a bar of N-type material and a gate of P-type 
material. Because the material in the channel is N-type, the device is called an N-channel JFET.
