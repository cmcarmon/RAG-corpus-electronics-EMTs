Starting from the 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri festive season, the Malaysian police enforced lower speed limits on federal and state roads during festive seasons, from the default 90 km/h (56 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph) as a preventive measures to reduce accidents during festive seasons. However, many road users complain about the viability of the lower speed limit because the accident rate during festive seasons continue to rise even with lower speed limits, as the lower speed limit doesn't seem to bring any significant effects of reducing the accident rate; therefore, lower speed limit alone is not the effective deterrent of fatal accidents during festive seasons.[1]
