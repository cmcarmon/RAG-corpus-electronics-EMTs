Another useful MOSFET circuit is the source follower shown in Figure 7.24. For rea-
sons that will be clear in our discussion of the source follower in Chapter 8, the source
follower is also called a buffer circuit. Assuming that the MOSFET operates in the sat-
uration region, determine the output voltage vOUT and the current iD given that the
input voltage vIN = 2 V, for the parameters indicated in the Figure 7.24.
We determine vOUT by writing the node equation for the output node:
