where Hm(w) denotes the frequency response of a ﬁlter associated with the mth recording device (sensor). The
sum of all N ﬁlters provides ﬂat frequency response so that waveforms arriving from the estimated directions
of  arrival  at  estimated  velocities  are  passed  undistorted  and  other  waveforms  are  suppressed.  In  the  planar
