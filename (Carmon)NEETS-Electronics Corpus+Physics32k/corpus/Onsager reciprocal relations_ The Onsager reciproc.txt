Onsager's contribution was to demonstrate that not only is




L

α
β




{\displaystyle L_{\alpha \beta }}
positive semi-definite, it is also symmetric, except in cases where time-reversal symmetry is broken. In other words, the cross-coefficients





L

u
ρ




{\displaystyle \ L_{u\rho }}
and





L

ρ
u




{\displaystyle \ L_{\rho u}}
are equal. The fact that they are at least proportional follows from simple dimensional analysis (i.e., both coefficients are measured in the same units of temperature times mass density).
The rate of entropy production for the above simple example uses only two entropic forces, and a 2x2 Onsager phenomenological matrix. The expression for the linear approximation to the fluxes and the rate of entropy production can very often be expressed in an analogous way for many more general and complicated systems.
