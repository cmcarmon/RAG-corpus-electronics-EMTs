Given the orientation matrix A(t) of a frame, defined for all t and derivable, we can obtain its instant angular velocity tensor W as follows. We know that:







d



r
→



(
t
)


d
t



=
W
⋅



r
→





{\displaystyle {\frac {d{\vec {r}}(t)}{dt}}=W\cdot {\vec {r}}}

As angular speed must be the same for the three vectors of a rotating frame, if we have a matrix A(t) whose columns are the vectors of the frame, we can write for the three vectors as a whole:







d
A
(
t
)


d
t



=
W
⋅
A
(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\frac {dA(t)}{dt}}=W\cdot A(t)}

And therefore the angular velocity tensor we are looking for is:




W
=



d
A
(
t
)


d
t



⋅

A

(
t
)


{\displaystyle W={\frac {dA(t)}{dt}}\cdot A^{-1}(t)}
