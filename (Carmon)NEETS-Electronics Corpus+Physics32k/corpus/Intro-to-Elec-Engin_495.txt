blocks: logic (combinational) blocks and sequential blocks (known as ﬂip-ﬂops). Logic blocks
are electronic circuits that usually have several inputs and one output. The physical devices that
perform the basic Boolean operations are known as logic gates. The basic logic gates are OR,
AND, and NOT, the interconnections of which form a logic network (also known as combinational
network), which does not generally contain memory devices. The Boolean function describing a
combinational network can be easily derived by systematically progressing from the input(s) to
the output on the logic gates.
The logic OR gate is an electronic circuit realization of the Boolean OR operation, which is
represented by the symbol +. F = A + B, for example, is read as “F is equal to A OR B.” The
OR operation yields 1 if the value of any of its arguments is 1. Figure 6.1.1 shows a two-input OR
gate along with its truth table (table of combinations for the gate) and an illustration of the OR
operation. A three-input OR gate with F = A+ B+ C would have a truth table with eight entries,
which can be developed by the reader as an exercise.
The logic AND gate is an electronic circuit realization of the Boolean AND operation, which
is represented by the symbol · or by the absence of an operator. Thus, for example, F = A · B
(also written simply as F = AB) is read as “F is equal to A AND B.” The AND operation yields 1
if and only if the values of all its arguments are 1s. Figure 6.1.2 shows a two-input AND gate, its
truth table, and an illustration of the AND operation. A three-input AND gate with F = A· B · C
would have a truth table with 23 = 8 possible entries, which can be developed by the reader as a
desirable exercise.
