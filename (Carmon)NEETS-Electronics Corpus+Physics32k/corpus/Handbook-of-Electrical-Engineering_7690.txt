Read-Only Memories (ROMs)
ROMs are the only form of semiconductor storage which is
permanently  nonvolatile.  Information  is  retained  without
power applied, and there is not even very gradual informa-
tion loss as in EEPROMs. It is also the most dense form of
semiconductor storage. ROMs are, however, less used than
RAMs or EEPROMs. ROMs must be personalized by a mask
in the fabrication process. This method is cumbersome and
expensive unless many identical parts are to be made. Fur-
thermore  it  seems  much “permanent”  information  is  not
really permanent and must be occasionally updated.
