The op-ampâ€™s normal mode of operation is a closed 
loop. The closed-loop mode uses feedback, as com-
pared to the open-loop mode, which does not use 
feedback. A lot of degenerative feedback is used with 
the closed-loop mode. This reduces the overall gain of 
the op-amp but provides better stability.
