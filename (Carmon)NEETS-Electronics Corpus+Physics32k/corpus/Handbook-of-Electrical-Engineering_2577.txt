Summary
It has been shown how a limited knowledge of bipolar operation can lead to properly biased ampliﬁer stages
using discrete transistors. An equivalent circuit—the hybrid-p model—was then derived, again from limited
information,  which  made  possible  the  analysis  of  such  stages,  and  some  purely  practical  design  results  were
favorably compared with its predictions. Finally, the tenets of this equivalent circuit were used to evaluate the
performance  of  the  difference  ampliﬁer  and  current  mirror  circuits,  which  are  the  cornerstones  of  modern
electronic  circuit  design  in  a  very  wide  variety  of  its  manifestations.  These  circuits  are,  in  fact,  the  classic
transconductance and translinear elements that are ubiquitous in modern IC signal conditioning and function
networks.
