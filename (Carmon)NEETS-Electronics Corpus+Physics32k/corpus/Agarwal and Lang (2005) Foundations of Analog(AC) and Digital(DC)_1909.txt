Plotting the frequency response of a network with the aid of a computer
for arbitrary system transfer functions as illustrated in Figure 13.13 is quite easy.
Nevertheless, it is still useful to be able to make approximate sketches of the
frequency response by inspection. Weâ€™ve already seen that obtaining insight into
the frequency response at low frequencies and high frequencies is a relatively
simple matter, as demonstrated by Equations 13.51 and 13.52 in Section 13.3.1.
At intermediate frequencies, however, the relation between output and input is
somewhat more complicated, especially for a network with several inductors
or capacitors. This section will show how the general shape of the frequency
response for first-order circuits can be sketched by inspection. Chapter 14 will
do the same
for an important class of second-order circuits. We will resort to
computer analysis for other circuits.4
