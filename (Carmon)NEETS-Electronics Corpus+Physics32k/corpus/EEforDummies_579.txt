You should never connect an LED directly to a power source, or you may fry 
the LED instantly. Instead, use a resistor in series with the LED to limit the 
forward current. For instance, in the circuit in Figure 9­10, a 9‐volt battery is 
used to power a red LED. The LED has a forward voltage drop of 2.0 V and a 
maximum current rating of 24 mA. The voltage drop across the resistor is the 
difference between the source voltage and the LED forward voltage, or 
9
 V
current to 24 mA (that’s 0.024 A) or less when the voltage dropped across the 
resistor is 7 V? You apply Ohm’s Law (which I discuss in Chapter 6) to
