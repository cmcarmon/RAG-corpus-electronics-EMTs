A governor, or speed limiter or controller, is a device used to measure and regulate the speed of a machine, such as an engine.
A classic example is the centrifugal governor, also known as the Watt or fly-ball governor on a reciprocating steam engine, which uses the effect of centrifugal force on rotating weights driven by the machine output shaft to regulate its speed by altering the input flow of steam.
