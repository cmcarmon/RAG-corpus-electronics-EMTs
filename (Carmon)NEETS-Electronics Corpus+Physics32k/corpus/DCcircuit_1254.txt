If a source of voltage is suddenly applied to an uncharged capacitor (a sudden increase of
voltage), the capacitor will draw current from that source, absorbing energy from it, until the
capacitor’s voltage equals that of the source. Once the capacitor voltage reached this ﬁnal
(charged) state, its current decays to zero. Conversely, if a load resistance is connected to a
charged capacitor, the capacitor will supply current to the load, until it has released all its
stored energy and its voltage decays to zero. Once the capacitor voltage reaches this ﬁnal
(discharged) state, its current decays to zero. In their ability to be charged and discharged,
capacitors can be thought of as acting somewhat like secondary-cell batteries.
