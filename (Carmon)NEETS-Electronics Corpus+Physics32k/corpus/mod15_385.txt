The E-transformer accelerometer (fig. 3-21) consists of a mass suspended from a calibrated leaf 
spring in a manner similar to a pendulum. The mass is effectively the armature of an E-transformer of the 
type used as an error detector in a servo system. The mass of the accelerometer is enclosed within a case 
that is filled with a damping liquid, which helps keep the pendulum from oscillating. The accelerometer is 
mounted so that acceleration in only the desired geometrical plane is detected.
