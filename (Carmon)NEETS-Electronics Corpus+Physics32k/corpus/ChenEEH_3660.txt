Vowels are voiced speech sounds involving a constant vocal-
tract shape. There are twelve principle vowels in American
English. A thirteenth vowel, called a schwa, is a sort of ‘‘degen-
erate vowel’’ to which many others gravitate when articulated
hastily in the course of ﬂowing speech. The initial vowel in
‘‘ahead’’ is a schwa vowel. All vowels are voiced and are nor-
mally among the phonemes of largest amplitude. Vowels can
vary widely in duration (typically from 40 to 400 ms). From an
articulatory point-of-view, vowels are differentiated by the
tongue-hump position and the degree of constriction at that
position. The tongue position is largely responsible for the
variation of cross-sectional area along the vocal tract which,
in turn, determines the formants of the vowel. From an acous-
tic point-of-view, therefore, the sets of formant frequencies are
fairly reliable discriminators of the various vowels.
