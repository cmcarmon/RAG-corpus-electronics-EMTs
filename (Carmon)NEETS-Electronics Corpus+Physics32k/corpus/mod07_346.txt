For years, scientists searched for a solution that would combine the high input impedance of the 
vacuum tube with the many other advantages of the transistor. The result of this research is the FIELD-
EFFECT TRANSISTOR (FET). In contrast to the bipolar transistor, which uses bias current between base 
and emitter to control conductivity, the FET uses voltage to control an electrostatic field within the 
transistor. Because the FET is voltage-controlled, much like a vacuum tube, it is sometimes called the 
"solid-state vacuum tube."
