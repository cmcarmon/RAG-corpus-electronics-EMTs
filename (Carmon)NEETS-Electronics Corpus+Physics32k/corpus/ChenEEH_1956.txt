For example, according to it, it is equally costly to bump a
net of length 9 as it is to bump three nets each of length 3.
The latter case, however, has a higher likelihood of conver-
gence because there is greater ï¬‚exibility in moving three
bumped nets (e.g., each can transit to a different track) than
a single net of the same total length. This leads to the second
cost function:
