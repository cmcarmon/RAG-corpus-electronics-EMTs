The graph G, which results after removing the edges in a cut,
will not be connected. A cutset S of a connected graph G is a
minimal set of edges of G, such that removal of S disconnects G.
Thus a cutset is also a cut. Note that the minimality property of a
cutset implies that no proper subset of a cutset is a cutset.
