Though so many issues are contentious or disputed, there are two aspects of the astrological ages that have virtually unanimous consensusâ€”firstly, the claimed link of the astrological ages to the axial precession of the Earth and commonly referred to as precession of the equinoxes; secondly, that, due to the nature of the precession of the equinoxes, the progression of the ages proceeds in reverse direction through the zodiacal signs.
