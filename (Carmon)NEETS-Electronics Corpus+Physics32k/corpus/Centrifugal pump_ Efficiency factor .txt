{\displaystyle \eta }
is the efficiency of the pump plant as a decimal
The head added by the pump (

{\displaystyle H}
) is a sum of the static lift, the head loss due to friction and any losses due to valves or pipe bends all expressed in metres of fluid. Power is more commonly expressed as kilowatts (103 W, kW) or horsepower (hp*0.746 = kW). The value for the pump efficiency,
