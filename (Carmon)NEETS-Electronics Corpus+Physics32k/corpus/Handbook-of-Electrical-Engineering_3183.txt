Some of the disadvantages are that large output ﬁlter capacitors are required to smooth the pulsating
output  current;  inductor  size  is  large  since  air  gaps  are  to  be  provided;  and  due  to  stability  reasons,
ﬂyback  converters  are  usually  operated  in  the  DCM,  which  results  in  increased  losses.  To  avoid  the
stability problem, ﬂyback converters are operated with current mode control explained earlier. Flyback
converters are used in the power range of 20 to 200 W.
