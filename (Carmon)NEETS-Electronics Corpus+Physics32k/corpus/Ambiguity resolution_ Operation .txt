The ambiguity region is shown graphically in this image. The x axis is range (left-right). The y axis is radial speed. The z axis is amplitude (up-down). The shape of the rectangles changes when the PRF changes.

The unambiguous zone is in the lower left corner. All of the other blocks have ambiguous range or ambiguous radial velocity.
Pulse Doppler radar relies on medium pulse repetition frequency (PRF) from about 3 kHz to 30 kHz. Each transmit pulse is separated by between 5 km and 50 km of distance.
