Active  sound  control  (ASC)  can  be  viewed  as  an  offspring  of ANC.  In ASC,  instead  of  trying  to  cancel  a
given  sound  ﬁeld,  one  tries  to  control  speciﬁc  spatial  and  temporal  characteristics  of  the  sound  ﬁeld.  One
application  is  in  adaptive  sound  reproduction  systems.  Here, ASC  aims  at  solving  the  large-audience  spatial
reproduction problem mentioned in the spatial processing section of this chapter.
