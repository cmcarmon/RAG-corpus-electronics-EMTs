An information-bearing signal often becomes contaminated by externally generated interference
and noise and/or by internally generated noise. The demodulated message signal is generally
degraded to some extent by the presence of these distortions (attenuation, interference, and
noise) in the received signal. The Ô¨Ådelity of the received message signal is then a function
of the type of modulation, the strength of the additive noise, the type and strength of any
other additive interference, and the type of any nonadditive interference or noise. This section
only introduces some of the major causes of interference and noise, and touches upon some
methods of dealing with their effects in order to minimize the interference and suppress the
noise.
