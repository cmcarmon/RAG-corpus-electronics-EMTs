or isolators are required. However, by the use of automatic-level control, the power output of the sweep 
generator can be maintained relatively constant at the point of measurement. The source impedance may 
thus be maintained very close to the nominal value. With this arrangement, any impedance variation in 
the connecting cables, connectors, and adapters is effectively cancelled since these components are within 
the leveling loop. The attenuation of a device under test will be displayed on the associated crt as a 
continuous response curve as it is scanned. This will result in an attenuation versus frequency plot of the 
device under test only.
