Figure 36-13 shows the current flow during the 
negative alternation of the input signal. The top of  
the secondary is negative, and the bottom is positive. 
The current flows from the top of the secondary, down 
through diode D1, through the load and diode D3, to 
the bottom of the secondary. Note that the current 
flows in the same direction through the load as dur-
ing the positive alternation. Again the entire voltage is 
dropped across the load.
