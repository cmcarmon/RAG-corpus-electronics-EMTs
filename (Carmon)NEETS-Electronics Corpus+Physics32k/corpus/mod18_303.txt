The first rf amplifier receives the pulses of the selected frequency from the synthesizer and a
modulator pulse (from the first stage modulator) at the same time. The rf pulse is usually slightly wider
than the modulator pulse which prevents the amplifier tube from pulsing when no rf energy is present.
Most pulsed rf amplifiers will oscillate at an undesired frequency if pulsed without an rf input. The output
of the first rf amplifier is an amplified rf pulse that is the same width as the first stage modulator pulse.
The second stage modulator is designed to produce a pulse slightly narrower than the first stage
modulator pulse; this also prevents the amplifier from pulsing when no rf is present. Therefore, the second
stage amplifier receives a modulator pulse a short time after the first stage rf arrives at the input. As
shown in figure 2-11, the same procedure is repeated in the third and final stage.
