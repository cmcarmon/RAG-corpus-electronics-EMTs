At many frequencies of interest, for example, the broadcast band, a half-wavelength
becomes  unreasonably  long.  Figure  38.2  shows  a  way  of  increasing  the  effective
length  of  the  dipole  without  making  it  longer.  Here,  additional  wires  have  been
added to the ends of the dipoles. These wires increase the end capacitance of the
dipole, thereby increasing the effective electrical length.
