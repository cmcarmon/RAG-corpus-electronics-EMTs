Regular Array to FPGA/RC Synthesis
RC emerges to exploit inherent and distributed storage, regu-
larity and local communication of VLSI layout, dynamic re-
conﬁguration, and spatial parallelism. As a consequence, more
computational power as well as data ﬂow computing with
high-throughput demand for multimedia and communication
applications can be realized at
low-power consumption
(Zhang et al., 2000). Meanwhile, advances in semiconductor
technology allow faster and larger FPGA/RC to become
common practice. This leads to demand of efﬁcient and auto-
matic algorithm mapping tools.
