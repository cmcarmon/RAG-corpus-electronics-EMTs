The SILICON CONTROLLED RECTIFIER, usually referred to as an SCR, is one of the family of 
semiconductors that includes transistors and diodes. A drawing of an SCR and its schematic 
representation is shown in views A and B of figure 3-17. Not all SCRs use the casing shown, but this is 
typical of most of the high-power units.
