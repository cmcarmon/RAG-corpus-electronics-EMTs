Because batteries create electron ﬂow in a circuit by exchanging electrons in ionic chemical
reactions, and there is a limited number of molecules in any charged battery available to react,
there must be a limited amount of total electrons that any battery can motivate through a
circuit before its energy reserves are exhausted. Battery capacity could be measured in terms
of total number of electrons, but this would be a huge number. We could use the unit of the
coulomb (equal to 6.25 x 1018 electrons, or 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons) to make the
quantities more practical to work with, but instead a new unit, the amp-hour, was made for
this purpose. Since 1 amp is actually a ﬂow rate of 1 coulomb of electrons per second, and
there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we can state a direct proportion between coulombs and
amp-hours: 1 amp-hour = 3600 coulombs. Why make up a new unit when an old would have
done just ﬁne? To make your lives as students and technicians more difﬁcult, of course!
