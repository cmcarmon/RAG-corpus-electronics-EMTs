Jet aerators are applied across a wide range of water, wastewater and biosolids treatment applications. Their primary purpose is to transfer oxygen to the liquid or sludge. A jet aerator works through aspirating technology by simultaneously introducing large volumes of high kinetic energy liquid and air through one or more jet nozzles. The high velocity liquid exits the inner, primary jet and rapidly mixes with the incoming air in the outer jet. This intense mixing and high degree of turbulence in the gas/liquid cloud travels outward from the jet along the basin floor prior to the vertical rise of the gas bubble column to the liquid surface.
