Direct conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy can be achieved by employing the Edison effect—the
release of electrons from a hot body, also known as thermionic emission. The thermal input imparts sufﬁcient

 work function) to a few electrons in the emitter (cathode), which helps them escape. If these electrons

are collected using a collector (anode) and a closed path through a load is established for them to complete
the circuit back to the cathode, then electrical output is obtained. Thermionic converters are heat engines with
electrons as the working ﬂuid and, as such, are subject to Carnot limitations.
