The  inï¬‚uence  of  hydrostatic  pressure  on  the  electrical  resistivity  can  provide  additional  insights  on  the
transport properties. Some of the noted features include (1) high pressures (in the GPa range, versus MPa for
tensile stresses) can be applied without destroying the crystal; (2) it does not destroy the symmetry, provided
no phase transition is involved; hence, the symmetry degeneracies in the band structure are not lifted; (3) band
edges  which  are  not  degenerate  for  symmetry  reasons  will  be  shifted;  and  (4)  nonlinear  effects  could  be
discerned.
