 2-48. In time-division multiplexing, assume
that a 4,000-hertz tone is applied to each
of six channels in a telegraph transmitter
and that each channel is to be sampled at
a rate of 2. 5 times during each cycle of
the 4,000-hertz tone.  At what speed, in
revolutions per second, must the rotating
switch turn to accomplish this sampling
rate?
