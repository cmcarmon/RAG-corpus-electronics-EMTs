The shunt capacitor (C1) charges and discharges at the ripple frequency rate, but the amplitude of the 
ripple voltage (Er) is relatively small because the inductor (L1) tends to keep a constant current flowing 
from the rectifier circuit to the load. In addition, the reactance of the shunt capacitor (XC) presents a low 
impedance to the ripple component existing at the output of the filter, and thus shunts the ripple 
component around the load. The capacitor attempts to hold the output voltage relatively constant at the 
average value of the voltage.
