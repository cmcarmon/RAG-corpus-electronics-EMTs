A single shift register can be arranged to provide its own input by means of feedback circuits, and its action
then becomes autonomous, since the only external signal required is the clock signal. There are only a ﬁnite
number of states of the feedback shift register (FSR), and the output sequence from the register will, therefore,
repeat  with  a  cycle  length  not  greater  than  2n  bits,  where  n  is  the  number  of  ﬂip-ﬂops  in  the  register.  This
property can be used to create a counter known as a Johnson counter in which the shift register has the J and
K inputs of the ﬁrst stage fed directly from the  Q¢ and Q outputs, respectively, of the last stage. This simple
form of feedback leads to the name twisted-ring counter, and the result is the generation of a creeping or stepping
code with 2n different states. This form of counter is convenient only when the count is small, as the number
of ﬂip-ﬂops quickly becomes excessive, but is ideal for a simple decade counter. Unlike standard binary decade
counters, the Johnson decade counter requires ﬁve ﬂip-ﬂops but no additional feedback circuitry. Gating needed
to detect speciﬁc settings of the counter is also very simple [Bannister and Whitehead, 1987].
