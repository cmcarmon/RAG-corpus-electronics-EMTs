Also note that neither the selector switch nor the jacks are labeled with measurement
ranges. In other words, there are no ”100 volt” or ”10 volt” or ”1 volt” ranges (or any equivalent
range steps) on this meter. Rather, this meter is ”autoranging,” meaning that it automatically
picks the appropriate range for the quantity being measured. Autoranging is a feature only
found on digital meters, but not all digital meters.
