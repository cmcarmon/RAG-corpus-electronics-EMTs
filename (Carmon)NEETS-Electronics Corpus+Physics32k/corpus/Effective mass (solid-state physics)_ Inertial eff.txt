A classical particle under the influence of a force accelerates according to Newton's second law, a = m−1F. This intuitive principle appears identically in semiclassical approximations derived from band structure. However, each of the symbols has a slightly modified meaning; acceleration becomes the rate of change in group velocity:

where ∇k is the del operator in reciprocal space, and force gives a rate of change in crystal momentum pcrystal:

where ai is the ith element of a, Fj is the jth element of F, ki and kj are the ith and jth elements of k, respectively, and E is the total energy of the particle according to the Planck–Einstein relation. The index j is contracted by the use of Einstein notation (there is an implicit summation over j). Since Newton's second law uses the inertial mass (not the gravitational mass), we can identify the inverse of this mass in the equation above as the tensor

This tensor expresses the change in group velocity due to a change in crystal momentum. Its inverse, Minert, is known as the effective mass tensor.
The inertial expression for effective mass is commonly used, but note that its properties can be counter-intuitive:
The effective mass tensor generally varies depending on k, meaning that the mass of the particle actually changes after it is subject to an impulse. The only cases in which it remains constant are those of parabolic bands, described above.
The effective mass tensor diverges (becomes infinite) for linear dispersion relations, such as with photons or electrons in graphene. (These particles are sometimes said to be massless, however this refers to their having zero rest mass; rest mass is a distinct concept from effective mass.)
