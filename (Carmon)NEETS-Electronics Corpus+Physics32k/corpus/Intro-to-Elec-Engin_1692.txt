Methods of Analysis
Just as differential equations are used to represent systems with analog signals, difference
equations are used for systems with discrete or digital data. Difference equations are also used
to approximate differential equations, since the former are more easily programmed on a digital
computer, and are generally easier to solve.
One of the mathematical tools devised for the analysis and design of discrete-data systems
is the z-transform with z = eT s. The role of the z-transform for digital systems is similar to that
of the Laplace transform for continuous-data systems. While the Laplace transform can be used
to solve linear ordinary differential equations, for linear difference equations and linear systems
with discrete or digital data, the z-transform becomes more appropriate to use. Since it is not a
simple matter to perform an inverse Laplace transform on transcendental functions which involve
âˆ’kT s, the need arises to convert transcendental functions in s into algebraic ones in
terms like e
z. The development of z-transform methods of analysis are considered to be outside the scope of
this book.
