There are disadvantages. Because of its construction, parts of the filament are closer to the plate than
other parts. This results in unequal emission and a loss of efficiency. Another disadvantage occurs when
dc is used to heat a filament. The filament represents a resistance. When current flows through this
resistance, a voltage drop occurs. The result is that one side of the resistance, or filament, is more negative
than the other side. The negative side of the filament will emit more electrons than the positive side;
which, again, is less efficient than if the filament has equal emission across its entire surface.
