Developed by Astrium and Dassault Aviation MLA would be fighter-launched multistage launch vehicle capable of placing 50â€“70 kg or 150 kg into Low Earth Orbit depending on a configuration. French military officials have signaled some interest in a responsive space launcher concept similar to what the United States is investigating.
Fighter aircraft offers an ability to maximize the gain due to airborne launch thanks achieving optimal altitude, velocity and flight path angle offering the possibility of a simplified sequence for jettisoning the launcher without important aerodynamic support like a big wings on Pegasus. Additional advantages include a possibility of fighter in-flight refueling, low infrastructure requirements and an ability of returning to any fighter-capable airfield in case of launch abort.
However launch vehicle mass and volume capacity is limited due to the generally small size of the plane and any constraint such as the train trap deployment, aerobrakes or ground clearance.
