indicating that the multiplication has produced both upward and downward frequency translation.
In Equation (14.2.4), the ﬁrst term is proportional to x(t), while the second looks like DSB at
carrier frequency 2fc. Then, if the low-pass ﬁlter in Figure 14.2.4(a) rejects the high-frequency
components and passes f ≤ W , the ﬁltered output z(t) will have the desired form z(t) = Kx(t).
