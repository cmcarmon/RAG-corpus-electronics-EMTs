In physics, the problem of time is a conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics in that quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative. This problem raises the question of what time really is in a physical sense and whether it is truly a real, distinct phenomenon. It also involves the related question of why time seems to flow in a single direction, despite the fact that no known physical laws seem to require a single direction.
Roughly speaking, it can be said that general relativity does not specifically require that time be considered a real phenomenon. This is because in general relativity, the Hamiltonian is an energy constraint that must vanish to allow for general covariance. However, in theories of quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian generates the time evolution of quantum states. Therefore, we arrive at the conclusion that "nothing moves" ("there is no time") in general relativity. Since "there is no time", the usual interpretation of quantum mechanics measurements at given moments of time breaks down. This problem of time is the broad banner for all interpretational problems of the formalism.
