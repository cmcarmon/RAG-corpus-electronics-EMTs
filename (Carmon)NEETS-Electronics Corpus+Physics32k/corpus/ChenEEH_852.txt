Even if the clock signals can be delivered to the registers in a
given circuit with arbitrary delays, it is generally not possible to
have all clock skews in the middle of the permissible range as
suggested above. The reason behind this characteristic is that
inherent structural limitations of the circuit create linear de-
pendencies among the clock skews in the circuit. These linear
dependencies and the effect of
these dependencies on a
number of circuit optimization techniques are examined in
detail in Section 4.3.
