There are two basic options for wind-electric conversion. With varying wind speeds, the aeroturbine can be
operated at a constant speed by blade-pitch control, and a conventional synchronous machine is then employed
to generate constant-frequency ac. More commonly, an induction generator is used with or without an adjust-
able var supply. In this case, the aeroturbine will operate at a nearly constant speed. Alternatively, the aeroturbine
rotational speed can be allowed to vary with wind to maintain a constant and optimum tip speed ratio, and
then a combination of special energy converters and power electronics is employed to obtain utility-grade ac.
