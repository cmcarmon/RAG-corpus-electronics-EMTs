The independent coordinate




z



{\displaystyle ~z~}
has sense of time. Indeed, it may be proportional to time




t



{\displaystyle ~t~}
with some relation like




z
=
t

/


t

0





{\displaystyle ~z=t/t_{0}~}
, where





t

0





{\displaystyle ~t_{0}~}
is constant.
The derivative

z





{\displaystyle ~{\dot {x}}={\frac {{\rm {d}}x}{{\rm {d}}z}}}
may have sense of velocity of particle with coordinate

z

{\displaystyle ~{\ddot {x}}={\frac {{\rm {d}}^{2}x}{{\rm {d}}z^{2}}}~}
can be interpreted as acceleration; and the mass of such a particle is equal to unity.
The dissipative function




D



{\displaystyle ~D~}
may have sense of coefficient of the speed-proportional friction.
Usually, both parameters




u



{\displaystyle ~u~}
and




v



{\displaystyle ~v~}
are supposed to be positive; then this speed-proportional friction coefficient grows exponentially at large positive values of coordinate

.
The potential

{\displaystyle ~\Phi (x)=e^{x}-x-1~}
is a fixed function, which also shows exponential growth at large positive values of coordinate




x



{\displaystyle ~x~}
.
In the application in laser physics,




x



{\displaystyle ~x~}
may have a sense of logarithm of number of photons in the laser cavity, related to its steady-state value. Then, the output power of such a laser is proportional to




exp
⁡
(
x
)



{\displaystyle ~\exp(x)~}
and may show pulsation at oscillation of




x



{\displaystyle ~x~}
.
Both analogies, with a unity mass particle and logarithm of number of photons, are useful in the analysis of behavior of the Toda oscillator.
