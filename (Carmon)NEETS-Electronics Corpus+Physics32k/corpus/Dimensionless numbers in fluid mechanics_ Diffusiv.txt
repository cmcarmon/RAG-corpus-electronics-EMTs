The classical numbers in transport phenomena of mass, momentum, and energy are principally analyzed by the ratio of effective diffusivities in each transport mechanism. The six dimensionless numbers give the relative strengths of the different phenomena of inertia, viscosity, conductive heat transport, and mass transport. (In the table, the number is the ratio of the left column quantity over top row quantity; e.g. Re = vd/Î·.) These same quantities may alternatively be expressed as ratios of characteristic time, length, or energy scales; these are less commonly used but can provide insight into particular applications.
