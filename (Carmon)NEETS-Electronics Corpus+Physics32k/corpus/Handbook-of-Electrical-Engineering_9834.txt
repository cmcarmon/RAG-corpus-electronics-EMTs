In the subsection that follows this, we will Ô¨Årst consider use of a composite or lag-lead network near crossover
to attenuate gain only to reduce the crossover frequency to a value where the phase lag is less. Then we will
consider more complex composite equalizers and state some general guidelines for Bode diagram design. Here,
we will use Bode diagram frequency domain design techniques to develop a design procedure for each of three
elementary types of series equalization.
