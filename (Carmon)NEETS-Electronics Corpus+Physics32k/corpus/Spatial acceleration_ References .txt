Roy Featherstone (1987). Robot Dynamics Algorithms. Springer. ISBN 0-89838-230-0. . This reference effectively combines screw theory with rigid body dynamics for robotic applications. The author also chooses to use spatial accelerations extensively in place of material accelerations as they simplify the equations and allows for compact notation.
JPL DARTS page has a section on spatial operator algebra (link: [1]) as well as an extensive list of references (link: [2]).
Bruno Siciliano, Oussama Khatib (2008). Springer Handbook of Robotics. Springer. . Page 41 (link: Google Books [3]) defines spatial accelerations for use in rigid body mechanics.
