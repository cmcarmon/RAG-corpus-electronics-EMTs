The relationships as a function of time for noise voltage,
square noise voltage, and mean-square noise voltage are illus-
trated in Figure 2.1; similar waveforms can also be shown for
representating noise current. If multiple noise sources are
present, they are considered to be independent and uncorre-
lated. Therefore, the cumulative noise contribution can be
expressed in mean-square units by:
