This can also be expressed in terms of the four-velocity by the equation:





J

U

u

c

U

α




{\displaystyle J^{\alpha }=\rho _{0}U^{\alpha }=\rho {\sqrt {1-{\frac {u^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}U^{\alpha }}

where ρ is the charge density measured by an observer at rest observing the electric current, and ρ0 the charge density for an observer moving at the speed u (the magnitude of the 3-velocity) along with the charges.
Qualitatively, the change in charge density (charge per unit volume) is due to the contracted volume of charge due to Lorentz contraction.
