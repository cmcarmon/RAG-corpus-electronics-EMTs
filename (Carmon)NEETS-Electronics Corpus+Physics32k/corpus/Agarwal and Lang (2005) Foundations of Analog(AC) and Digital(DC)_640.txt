Although this process yielded fairly quickly the form of iD, a bit of insight
will simplify the process even further by enabling the use of linear circuit tech-
niques to solve the problem as promised in the introduction of this section.
We proceed by drawing attention to Equation 4.61. Equation 4.61 is certainly
nonlinear. But an important interpretation central to all incremental arguments
allows us to solve the problem by linear circuit methods. Note from Equa-
tion 4.62 that the first term in Equation 4.61, the DC current ID, is independent
of vD. It depends only on the circuit parameters and the DC voltage VD
which is the same as the DC source voltage VI. Thus ID can be found with
vD, set to zero. On this basis, the second term in Equation 4.61 is linear in
vD, because we have shown that there is no hidden vD dependence in ID.
Hence the second term, the change in the current i is linearly proportional to the
change in v, can be found from a linear circuit.
