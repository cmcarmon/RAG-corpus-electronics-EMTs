Note that the angle and magnitude characteristics will have the opposite sign for the case of
a complex conjugate pair of poles. It should also be pointed out that the straight-line quadratic
representations are not generally good approximations (particularly in the one-decade region on
either side of the break frequency), and a few points may be calculated to obtain the correct curves
in the questionable frequency range.
