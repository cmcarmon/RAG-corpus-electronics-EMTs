recognized standards used as a basis for certification. 
Only when a product has been certified to an applic-
able standard does it bear the appropriate CSA certifi-
cation mark. Certification marks appear on a productâ€™s 
packaging as well as on, or adhered to, the product it-
self. For consumers, the mark provides increased as-
surance of safety.
