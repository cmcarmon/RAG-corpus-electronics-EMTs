In the torque differential transmitter, BOTH the rotor and stator windings consist of three Y-
connected coils, as illustrated in view A of figure 1-19. The stator is normally the primary, and receives 
its input signal from a synchro transmitter. The voltages appearing across the differential's rotor terminals 
(R1, R2, and R3) are determined by the magnetic field produced by the stator currents, the physical 
positioning of the rotor, and the step-up turns ratio between the stator and the rotor. The magnetic field, 
created by the stator currents, assumes an angle corresponding to that of the magnetic field in the 
transmitter supplying the signal. The position of the rotor controls the amount of magnetic coupling that 
takes place between the stator magnetic field and the rotor, and therefore, the amount of voltage induced 
into the rotor windings. If the rotor position changes in response to a mechanical input, then the voltages 
induced into its windings also change. Therefore, the output voltage of the TDX varies as a result of either 
a change in the input stator voltage or a change in the mechanical input to the rotor. This electrical output 
of the TDX may be either the SUM or the DIFFERENCE of the two inputs depending upon how the three 
units (the TX, the TDX, and the TR) are connected.
