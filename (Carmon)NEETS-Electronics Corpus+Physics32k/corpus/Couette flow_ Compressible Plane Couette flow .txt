This problem was first addressed by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant. When the upper and lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity profile is complicated, but it turns out it has an exact implicit solution.
Consider the plane Couette flow with lower wall at rest and fluid properties being denoted with subscript



w


{\displaystyle w}
and let the upper wall move with constant velocity



U


{\displaystyle U}
with properties denoted with subscript



∞


{\displaystyle \infty }
. The properties and the pressure at the upper wall are prescribed and taken as reference quantities. Let



l


{\displaystyle l}
be the distance between the two walls. The boundary conditions are

Liepmann studied the effects of dissociation and ionization (i.e.




c
