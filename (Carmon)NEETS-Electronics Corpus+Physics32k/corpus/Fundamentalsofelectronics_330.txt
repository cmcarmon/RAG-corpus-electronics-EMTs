the complex amplitude of the input, the voltage Vin?
(b) What equivalent circuit does the load resistor RL see?
(c) Find the output current when vin = V0e−t/τ .
Problem 3.44: Why Op-Amps are Useful
The cascade of op-amp circuits shown in Figure 3.83 illustrates the reason why op-amp realizations of transfer
functions are so useful.
