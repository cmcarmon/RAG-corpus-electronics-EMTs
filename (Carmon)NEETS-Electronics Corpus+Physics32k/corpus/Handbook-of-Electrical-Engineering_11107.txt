If the mechanism of interaction were to involve simple charge transfer by the applied electric ﬁeld, it would
be useful to compare the magnitude of the charge transferred by a single pulse, within a speciﬁed volume, with
the random charge ﬂuctuation due to thermal excitation during the pulse. An equation due to Einstein [1956]
gives  the  mean  square  value  of  the  charge  ﬂuctuation  dq  in  terms  of  Boltzmann’s  constant  k,  the  absolute
temperature T, the conductance G of the current-carrying region, and the observation time t:
