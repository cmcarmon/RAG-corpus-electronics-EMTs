A broadside array is shown in figure 4-26, view A. Physically, it looks somewhat like a ladder. 
When the array and the elements in it are polarized horizontally, it looks like an upright ladder. When the 
array is polarized vertically, it looks like a ladder lying on one side (view B). View C is an illustration of 
the radiation pattern of a broadside array. Horizontally polarized arrays using more than two elements are 
not common. This is because the requirement that the bottom of the array be a significant distance above 
the earth presents construction problems. Compared with collinear arrays, broadside arrays tune sharply, 
but lose efficiency rapidly when not operated on the frequencies for which they are designed.
