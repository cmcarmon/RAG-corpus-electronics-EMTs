A NAND gate is a combination of an inverter and 
an AND gate. It is called a NAND gate from the NOT-
AND function it performs. The NAND gate is the 
most commonly used logic function. This is because 
it can be used to construct an AND gate, OR gate, 
 inverter, or any combination of these functions.
