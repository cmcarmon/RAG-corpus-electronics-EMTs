As illustrated in Chapter 9, capacitances and inductances impact circuit behavior.
The effect of capacitances and inductances is so acute in high-speed digital cir-
cuits, for example, that our simple digital abstractions developed in Chapter 6
based on a static discipline become insufficient for signals that undergo transi-
tions. Therefore, understanding the behavior of circuits containing capacitors
and inductors is important. In particular, this chapter will augment our digital
abstraction with the concept of delay to include the effects of capacitors and
inductors.
