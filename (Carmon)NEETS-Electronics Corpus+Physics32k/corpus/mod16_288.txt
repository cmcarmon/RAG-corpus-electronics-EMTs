Resistance measurements usually are not made in transistorized circuits, except when you are
checking for open windings in transformers and coils. When a resistance check is required, the transistors
are usually removed from the circuit. Resistance checks cannot test all the characteristics of transistors,
especially transistors designed for high frequencies or fast switching. The ohmmeter is capable of making
simple transistor tests, such as open and short tests.
