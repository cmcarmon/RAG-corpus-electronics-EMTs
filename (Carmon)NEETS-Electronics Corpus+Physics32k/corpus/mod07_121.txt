It would seem that if we joined the N and P materials together by one of the processes mentioned
earlier, all the holes and electrons would pair up. On the contrary, this does not happen. Instead the
electrons in the N material diffuse (move or spread out) across the junction into the P material and fill
some of the holes. At the same time, the holes in the P material diffuse across the junction into the N
material and are filled by N material electrons. This process, called JUNCTION RECOMBINATION,
reduces the number of free electrons and holes in the vicinity of the junction. Because there is a depletion,
or lack of free electrons and holes in this area, it is known as the DEPLETION REGION.
