According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period T (in seconds) of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:




T
=
2
π




a

3


μ





{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {a^{3}}{\mu }}}}

where:
a is the orbit's semi-major axis in meters
μ = GM is the standard gravitational parameter in m3/s2G is the gravitational constant,
M is the mass of the more massive body.

For all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.
Inversely, for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to have a given orbital period:




a
=




G
M

T

{\displaystyle a={\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {GMT^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}}}}

where:
a is the orbit's semi-major axis in meters,
G is the gravitational constant,
M is the mass of the more massive body,
T is the orbital period in seconds.
For instance, for completing an orbit every 24 hours around a mass of 100 kg, a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08 meters from its center of mass.
