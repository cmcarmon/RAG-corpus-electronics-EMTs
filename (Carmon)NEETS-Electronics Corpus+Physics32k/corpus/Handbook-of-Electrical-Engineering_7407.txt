When transmitter and receiver are stationery, antenna considerations for telemetry are no different than for
communications. The usual case, however, is that the transmitter is moving, both rotating and translating and
often obscuring the transmission with reï¬‚ective material. This poses problems in both receiving the signal and
tracking the moving transmitter with a directive receiving antenna. In many cases it is necessary to have two
or more receiving antennas to receive from a single transmitter.
