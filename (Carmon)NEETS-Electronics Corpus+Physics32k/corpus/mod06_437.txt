pulses is the same as the frequency of the input sine wave. The output pulse frequency is called RIPPLE 
FREQUENCY. If the rectifier circuit is supplied power from a 60-hertz ac line voltage, 60 pulses of load 
current will occur each second. Therefore, THE RIPPLE FREQUENCY OF A HALF-WAVE 
RECTIFIER IS THE SAME AS THE LINE FREQUENCY.
