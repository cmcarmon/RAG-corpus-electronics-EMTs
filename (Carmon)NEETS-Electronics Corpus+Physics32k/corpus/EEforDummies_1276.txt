Thousands of project ideas are available on the 
Internet. Use your favorite search engine to find 
projects in topics or specific parts that  interest 
you. For instance, search for simple audio circuits 
or 555 timer circuits to get loads of ideas — some 
with complete explanations, schematics, and photo­
graphs of a breadboarded circuit. Or choose an 
idea for a circuit and see if one is out there already. 
A search for door alarm circuit, for example, turns up 
many simple circuit ideas and even YouTube videos.
