FIGURE 69.26 An example of the masking effect. Based on the hearing threshold of the human ear (dashed line), a 500-
Hz sinusoidal acoustic waveform, shown at A on the left graph, is easily audible at relatively low levels. However, it can be
masked by adding nearby higher-amplitude components, as shown on the right. (Source: CCi.)
