This  is  the  current-voltage  relationship  for  a  capacitor,  assuming  the
passive  sign  convention. The  relationship  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  6.6  for
a  capacitor  whose  capacitance  is  independent  of  voltage.  Capacitors
that  satisfy  Eq.  (6.4)  are  said  to  be  linear. For  a  nonlinear  capacitor,
the  plot  of  the  current-voltage  relationship  is  not  a  straight  line.
Although  some  capacitors  are  nonlinear,  most  are  linear.  We  will
assume linear capacitors in this book.
