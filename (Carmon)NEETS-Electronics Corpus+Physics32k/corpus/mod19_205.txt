N series connectors are low-voltage, 50-ohm, threaded coupling connectors designed for use with 
small and medium size rf cable. They have a 1,000 volts peak rating and are weatherproof. There is a 
group of N series connectors that are 70 ohms and are numbered UG-98A/U and UG-96A/U. These 70-
ohm N connectors are designed for cables such as RG-61C, RG-11/U, and RG-13/U. The 70-ohm 
connectors will not mate with 50-ohm connectors of this series. Figure 1-29 shows three typical N series 
connectors. Figure 1-30 illustrates the method used to attach N connectors to coaxial cable. Table 1-16 
shows which N connector to use with what rf cable type.
