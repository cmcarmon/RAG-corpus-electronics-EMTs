and if the nonzero parts of ce;n and ch;n, occupy different parts
of the quefrency axis, we should be able to examine them as
separate entities—something that we are unable to do when
they are convolved in {sn}. In fact, the excitation component,
{ce;n}, tends to have most of its energy at relatively large (and
‘‘rahmonically spaced’’) values of n, since its quefrency domain
counterpart manifests fast, periodic variations. The use of a
time window to select out the component due to the excita-
tion, {ce;n}, has been called high-time liftering to stress the
analogy to high-pass ﬁltering. For similar reasons, the vocal
