(b) Determine the output resistance of the circuit.
*5.1.9 (a) Two ampliﬁers, which can be represented by
the model of Figure 5.1.1 of the text, are con-
nected in cascade (that is, head to tail), as
shown in Figure P5.1.9. Let their parameters
be Ri1, Ro1, A1, and Ri2, Ro2, A2, respectively.
Find vx/v1.
