You should be thoroughly familiar with the calibration of your ohmmeter. Analog meters are
typically more accurate and easier to read at midscale. With the exception of bridge circuits, a meter may
provide only approximate resistance readings. However, these readings may be adequate when you also
consider the wide tolerances of resistors themselves. An ohmmeter that you use in field testing should be
portable, convenient, and simple to operate - factors that usually are more important than extreme
accuracy.
