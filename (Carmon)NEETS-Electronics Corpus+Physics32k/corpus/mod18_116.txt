MECHANICAL SCANNING.â€”The most common type of mechanical scanning is the rotation of
the antenna through 360 degrees to obtain azimuth coverage. Most search radar sets use this method. A
common form of scanning for target tracking or missile beam-rider systems is CONICAL (cone-like)
SCANNING. This is generally accomplished mechanically by NUTATING the rf feed point.
