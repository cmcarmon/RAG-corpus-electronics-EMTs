Here we assume that the wave is regular in the sense that the different quantities describing the wave such as the wavelength, frequency and thus the wavenumber are constants. See wavepacket for discussion of the case when these quantities are not constant.
In general, the angular wavenumber



k


{\displaystyle k}
(i.e. the magnitude of the wave vector) is given by




k
=



2
π

λ


=



2
π
ν


v


p





=


ω

v


p







{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi }{\lambda }}={\frac {2\pi \nu }{v_{\mathrm {p} }}}={\frac {\omega }{v_{\mathrm {p} }}}}

where



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the frequency of the wave,



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is the wavelength,



ω
=
2
π
ν


{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi \nu }
is the angular frequency of the wave, and




v


p





{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {p} }}
is the phase velocity of the wave. The dependence of the wavenumber on the frequency (or more commonly the frequency on the wavenumber) is known as a dispersion relation.
For the special case of an electromagnetic wave in a vacuum, in which the wave propagates at the speed of light, k is given by:




k
=


E

ℏ
c





{\displaystyle k={\frac {E}{\hbar c}}}

where E is the energy of the wave, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum.
For the special case of a matter wave, for example an electron wave, in the non-relativistic approximation (in the case of a free particle, that is, the particle has no potential energy):




k
≡



2
π

λ


=


p
ℏ


=



2
m
E

ℏ




{\displaystyle k\equiv {\frac {2\pi }{\lambda }}={\frac {p}{\hbar }}={\frac {\sqrt {2mE}}{\hbar }}}

Here p is the momentum of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, E is the kinetic energy of the particle, and ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.
Wavenumber is also used to define the group velocity.
