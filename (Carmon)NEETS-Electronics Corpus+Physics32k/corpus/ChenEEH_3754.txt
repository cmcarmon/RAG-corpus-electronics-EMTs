that has a(ijj) as its (i,j) element, where S is the total number of
states in the model. Since the random variables of the Markov
process take only discrete values (integers), the state process is
called a Markov chain. Further, since the state-transition
probabilities do not depend on t, the Markov chain is said to
be homogeneous in time.
