(a) Develop a general expression for the force exerted on the iron plunger and comment on
its dependence on position x.
(b) Determine the current through the coil of N = 100 turns to pull the plunger to x = a,
given that a = 1 cm, lg = 1 mm, and the spring constant is k = 1 N/m. Assume the
permeability of the magnetic structure to be inÔ¨Ånite and neglect fringing.
