Most  machine  models  for  electromechanical  transient  studies  are  derived  from  a  lumped-parameter  circuit
representation of the machine’s windings. Such lumped-parameter circuit representations are adequate for low-
frequency electromechanical phenomena. They are suited for dynamical studies, often times to determine the
machine’s performance and control behavior or to learn about the nature of interactions from electromechanical
oscillations. Studies of interactions occurring at higher frequencies, such as surge or traveling waves studies,
may require a distributed-parameter circuit representation of the machine windings.
