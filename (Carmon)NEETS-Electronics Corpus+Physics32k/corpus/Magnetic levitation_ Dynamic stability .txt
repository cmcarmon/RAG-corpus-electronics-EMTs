Dynamic stability occurs when the levitation system is able to damp out any vibration-like motion that may occur.
Magnetic fields are conservative forces and therefore in principle have no built-in damping, and in practice many of the levitation schemes are under-damped and in some cases negatively damped. This can permit vibration modes to exist that can cause the item to leave the stable region.
Damping of motion is done in a number of ways:
external mechanical damping (in the support), such as dashpots, air drag etc.
eddy current damping (conductive metal influenced by field)
tuned mass dampers in the levitated object
electromagnets controlled by electronics
