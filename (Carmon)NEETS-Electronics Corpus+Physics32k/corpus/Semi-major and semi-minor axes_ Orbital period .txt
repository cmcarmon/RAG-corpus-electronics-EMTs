In astrodynamics the orbital period

{\displaystyle T}
of a small body orbiting a central body in a circular or elliptical orbit is:

{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {a^{3} \over \mu }}}

where:




a


{\displaystyle a}
is the length of the orbit's semi-major axis




μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the standard gravitational parameter of the central body
Note that for all ellipses with a given semi-major axis, the orbital period is the same, regardless of eccentricity.

In astronomy, the semi-major axis is one of the most important orbital elements of an orbit, along with its orbital period. For Solar System objects, the semi-major axis is related to the period of the orbit by Kepler's third law (originally empirically derived),

{\displaystyle T^{2}\propto a^{3}\,}

where

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant,



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass of the central body, and



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the orbiting body. Typically, the central body's mass is so much greater than the orbiting body's, that



m


{\displaystyle m}
may be ignored. Making that assumption and using typical astronomy units results in the simpler form Kepler discovered.
The orbiting body's path around the barycentre and its path relative to its primary are both ellipses. The semi-major axis is sometimes used in astronomy as the primary-to-secondary distance when the mass ratio of the primary to the secondary is significantly large (

{\displaystyle M\gg m}
); thus, the orbital parameters of the planets are given in heliocentric terms. The difference between the primocentric and "absolute" orbits may best be illustrated by looking at the Earth–Moon system. The mass ratio in this case is 81.30059. The Earth–Moon characteristic distance, the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, is 384,400 km. The barycentric lunar orbit, on the other hand, has a semi-major axis of 379,700 km, the Earth's counter-orbit taking up the difference, 4,700 km. The Moon's average barycentric orbital speed is 1.010 km/s, whilst the Earth's is 0.012 km/s. The total of these speeds gives a geocentric lunar average orbital speed of 1.022 km/s; the same value may be obtained by considering just the geocentric semi-major axis value.
