5. Reenergize the circuit. Start with a high scale on the meter and work down to the 0- to 5-volts 
scale to protect the meter movement. At the same time, turn the stator of the CT to obtain a zero 
or minimum reading on the meter. Clamp down the CT stator, ensuring the reading does not 
change. This is the fine electrical zero position of the CT.
