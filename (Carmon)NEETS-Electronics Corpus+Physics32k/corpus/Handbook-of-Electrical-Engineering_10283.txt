Impact of “Free Flight”
“Free Flight” is a term describing an airspace navigation system in which the “normal” air trafﬁc controls are
replaced  by  the  regular  transmission  of  position  information  from  the  airplane  to  the  ground.  The  ground
system, by projecting the aircraft position and time, can determine if the intended tracks of two aircraft would
result in a cohabitation of the same point in the airspace. This is commonly called “conﬂict probe”. If a potential
conﬂict occurs, then a message is transmitted to one or more of the aircraft involved to make a change to course
and/or speed.
