A shunt resistor is nothing more than a resistor in parallel with the meter movement. To measure
high currents, very small resistance shunts are used so the majority of the current will go through the
shunt. Since the total resistance of a parallel circuit (the meter movement and shunt resistor) is always less
than the resistance of the smallest resistor, as an ammeterâ€™s range is increased, its resistance decreases.
This is important because the load resistance of high-current circuits is smaller than the load resistance of
low-current circuits. To obtain accurate measurements, it is necessary that the ammeter resistance be
much less than the load resistance, since the ammeter is connected in series with the load.
