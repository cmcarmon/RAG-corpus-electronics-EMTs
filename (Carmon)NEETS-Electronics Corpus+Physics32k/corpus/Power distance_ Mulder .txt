Another major study of power distance was the one that was undertaken by Mauk Mulder. It was based on the premise that as societies become weaker in power distance, the underprivileged will tend to reject their power dependency. Mulder's laboratory experiments in the social and organizational context of the Netherlands, a low power distance culture, concluded that people attempted to seek “power distance reduction”. He found that:
More privileged individuals tend to try to preserve or to broaden their power distance from subordinates.
The larger their power distance is from a subordinate, the more the power holder would try to increase that distance.
Less powerful individuals try to decrease the power distance between themselves and their superiors.
The smaller the power distance, the more likely is the occurrence of less powerful individuals trying to reduce that distance.
From these findings, he concluded that a condition of quasi-equilibrium had arisen. In this condition, power holders have achieved a certain distance from people who lack power, and this distance is hard for the powerless to bridge.
