One of the most common types of resistors is the molded composition, usually referred to as the
carbon resistor. These resistors are manufactured in a variety of sizes and shapes. The chemical
composition of the resistor determines its ohmic value and is accurately controlled by the manufacturer in
the development process. They are made in ohmic values that range from one ohm to millions of ohms.
The physical size of the resistor is related to its wattage rating, which is the ability of resistor to dissipate
heat caused by the resistance.
