Stability: An equilibrium state x of a system is stable if there is an e0 > 0 with the following property: for all
**  < e, then ** x – x(t) ** < e1 for all t > t0. A system is
e1, 0 < e1 < e0, there is an e > 0 such that if ** x – x0
stable if the poles of its closed-loop transfer function are (1) in the left half of the complex frequency
plane, called the s-plane (inside the unit circle of the z-plane for discrete systems), or (2) on the imaginary
axis, and all of the poles on the imaginary axis are single (on the unit circle and all such poles are single
for  discrete  systems).  Stability  for  a system  with  repeated  poles  on  the  j  w  axis  (the  unit  circle)  is
complicated and is examined in the discussion after Theorem 12.5. In the electrical engineering literature,
this deﬁnition of stability is sometimes called marginal stability and sometimes stability in the sense of
Lyapunov.
