In a gallium-arsenide semiconductor, empty electron conduction bands exist that are at a higher 
energy level than the conduction bands occupied by most of the electrons. Any electrons that do occupy 
the higher conduction band essentially have no mobility. If an electric field of sufficient intensity is 
applied to the semiconductor electrons, they will move from the low-energy conduction band to the high-
energy conduction band and become essentially immobile. The immobile electrons no longer contribute 
to the current flow and the applied voltage progressively increases the rate at which the electrons move 
from the low band to the high band. As the curve in figure 2-48 shows, the maximum current rate is 
reached and begins to decrease even though the applied voltage continues to increase. The point at which 
the current on the curve begins to decrease is called the THRESHOLD. This point is the beginning of the 
negative-resistance region. Negative resistance is caused by electrons moving to the higher conduction 
band and becoming immobile.
