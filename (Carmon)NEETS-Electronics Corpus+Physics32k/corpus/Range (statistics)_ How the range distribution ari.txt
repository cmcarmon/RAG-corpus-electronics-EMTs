The probability of having a specific range value, t, can be determined by adding the probabilities of having two samples differing by t, and every other sample having a value between the two extremes. The probability of one sample having a value of x is



n
∗
g

(
x
)



{\displaystyle n*g\left(x\right)}
. The probability of another having a value t greater than x is

g

(

x
+
t

)



{\displaystyle \left(n-1\right)g\left(x+t\right)}
. The probability of all other values lying between these two extremes is
