As you will learn in this chapter, radio waves are propagated. PROPAGATION means "movement
through a medium." This is most easily illustrated by light rays. When a light is turned on in a darkened
room, light rays travel from the light bulb throughout the room. When a flashlight is turned on, light rays
also radiate from its bulb, but are focused into a narrow beam. You can use these examples to picture how
radio waves propagate. Like the light in the room, radio waves may spread out in all directions. They can
also be focused (concentrated) like the flashlight, depending upon the need. Radio waves are a form of
radiant energy, similar to light and heat. Although they can neither be seen nor felt, their presence can be
detected through the use of sensitive measuring devices. The speed at which both forms of waves travel is
the same; they both travel at the speed of light.
