In this criterion W is a positive-deﬁnite Hermitian matrix, and the asterisk symbol designates the operation of
complex  transposition.  It  is  to  be  noted  that  if  w  is  a  Gaussian  random  vector  with  covariance  matrix W –1,
then the minimization of functional (14.83) corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of the signal
component Ha.
