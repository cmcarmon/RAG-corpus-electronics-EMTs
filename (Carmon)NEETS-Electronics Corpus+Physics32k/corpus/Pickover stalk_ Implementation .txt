The below example, written in pseudocode, renders a Mandelbrot set colored using a Pickover Stalk with a transformation vector and a color dividend.
The transformation vector is used to offset the (x, y) position when sampling the point's distance to the horizontal and vertical axis.
The color dividend is a float used to determine how thick the stalk is when it is rendered.
