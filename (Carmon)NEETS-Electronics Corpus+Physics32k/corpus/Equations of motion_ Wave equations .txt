Equations of wave motion are called wave equations. The solutions to a wave equation give the time-evolution and spatial dependence of the amplitude. Boundary conditions determine if the solutions describe traveling waves or standing waves.
From classical equations of motion and field equations; mechanical, gravitational wave, and electromagnetic wave equations can be derived. The general linear wave equation in 3D is:

∇

X


{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{v^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}X}{\partial t^{2}}}=\nabla ^{2}X}

where X = X(r, t) is any mechanical or electromagnetic field amplitude, say:
the transverse or longitudinal displacement of a vibrating rod, wire, cable, membrane etc.,
the fluctuating pressure of a medium, sound pressure,
the electric fields E or D, or the magnetic fields B or H,
the voltage V or current I in an alternating current circuit,
and v is the phase velocity. Nonlinear equations model the dependence of phase velocity on amplitude, replacing v by v(X). There are other linear and nonlinear wave equations for very specific applications, see for example the Korteweg–de Vries equation.
