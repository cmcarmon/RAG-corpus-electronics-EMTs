In computational fluid dynamics QUICK, which stands for Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics, is a higher-order differencing scheme that considers a three-point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation for the cell face values. In computational fluid dynamics there are many solution methods for solving the steady convection–diffusion equation. Some of the used methods are the central differencing scheme, upwind scheme, hybrid scheme, power law scheme and QUICK scheme.
The QUICK scheme was presented by Brian P. Leonard – together with the QUICKEST (QUICK with Estimated Streaming Terms) scheme – in a 1979 paper.
In order to find the cell face value a quadratic function passing through two bracketing or surrounding nodes and one node on the upstream side must be used. In central differencing scheme and second order upwind scheme the first order derivative is included and the second order derivative is ignored. These schemes are therefore considered second order accurate where as QUICK does take the second order derivative into account, but ignores the third order derivative hence this is considered third order accurate. This scheme is used to solve convection–diffusion equations using second order central difference for the diffusion term and for the convection term the scheme is third order accurate in space and first order accurate in time. QUICK is most appropriate for steady flow or quasi-steady highly convective elliptic flow.
