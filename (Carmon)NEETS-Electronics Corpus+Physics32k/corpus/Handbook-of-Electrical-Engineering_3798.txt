The modal parameter fc has units hertz and is called the cut-off frequency of the mode it is associated with.
According to Eq. (37.63), when f > fc , the propagation constant g is imaginary and thus the mode is propagating.
On the other hand, when f < fc , g is real, which means that the ﬁelds decay exponentially with increasing values
of z. Modes operated at frequencies below their cut-off frequency are not able to propagate energy over long
distances and are called evanescent modes.
