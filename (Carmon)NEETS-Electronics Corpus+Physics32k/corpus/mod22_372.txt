In ASCII, rather than breaking letters into three groups, uppercase letters are assigned codes 
beginning with hexadecimal value 41 and continuing sequentially through hexadecimal value 5A. 
Similarly, lowercase letters are assigned hexadecimal values of 61 through 7A. The decimal values 1 
through 9 are assigned the zone code 0011 in ASCII rather that 1111 as in EBCDIC. Figure 4-7 is the 
ASCII coding chart showing uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters and numeric digits 0 through 
9.
