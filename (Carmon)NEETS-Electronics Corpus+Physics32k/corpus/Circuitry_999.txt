Note that the antilog or ‘inverse log’ function can 
be  found  using  your  calculator.  This  sometimes 
appears as a button marked ‘10x’  or is obtained by 
pressing ‘shift’ (to enable the inverse function) and 
then  ‘log’.  In  any  event,  you  should  refer  to  your 
calculator’s  instruction  book  for  more  information 
on the keystrokes required!
