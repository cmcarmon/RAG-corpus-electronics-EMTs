The rules above are usually used to predict 'F' based upon 'B' and 'I' - the force on a moving charge when moving through a field, whether or not the charge is carried in a wire. However, this rule should not be confused with a different right hand grip rule for the prediction of the direction of a field ('B') produced by current ('I') traveling through a wire.
