To help compare different orders of magnitude, this section lists distances starting at 100 Zm (1023 m or 11 million light years).
140 Zm – 15 million light years – Distance to Centaurus A galaxy
250 Zm – 27 million light years – Distance to the Pinwheel Galaxy
280 Zm – 30 million light years – Distance to the Sombrero Galaxy
570 Zm – 60 million light years – Approximate distance to the Virgo cluster, nearest galaxy cluster
620 Zm – 65 million light years – Approximate distance to the Fornax cluster
800 Zm – 85 million light years – Approximate distance to the Eridanus cluster
