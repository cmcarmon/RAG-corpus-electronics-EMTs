The application of resistive circuits is quite limited. With the intro-
duction of capacitors and inductors in this chapter, we will be able to
analyze more important and practical circuits. Be assured that the cir-
cuit analysis techniques covered in Chapters 3 and 4 are equally appli-
cable to circuits with capacitors and inductors.
