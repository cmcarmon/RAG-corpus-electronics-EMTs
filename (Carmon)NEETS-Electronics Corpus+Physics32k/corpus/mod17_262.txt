A continuously variable tone control is illustrated in figure 2-23. Tone control R1 and bypass
capacitor C1 act as a variable RC filter. With the wiper arm of R1 in the upper (BASS) position, C1
bypasses the higher frequencies to ground and provides better bass response. When the wiper arm of R1 is
in the lower (TREBLE) position, the resistance of R1 is placed in series with C1, which reduces the
shunting effect of C1 to high frequencies and improves the treble response. This method gives you the
advantage of smooth, continuous tone control at all points between maximum bass and maximum treble
response.
