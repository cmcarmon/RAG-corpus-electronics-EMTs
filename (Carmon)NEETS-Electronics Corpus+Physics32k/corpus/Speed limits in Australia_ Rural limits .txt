Outside of built up areas, a prima facie speed limit applied. In New South Wales and Victoria, the prima facie speed limit was 50 miles per hour (80 km/h in New South Wales after metrication). In the 1970s however, most state prima facie speed limits were gradually replaced by absolute limits. An absolute speed limit of 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) was introduced to Victoria in 1971, as a trial. This was subsequently reduced to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) in late 1973. South Australia introduced an absolute speed limit of 60 mph in 1974.
With the onset of metrication in 1974 the rural defaults of 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) and 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) became 100 kilometres per hour (62 mph) and 110 kilometres per hour (68 mph) respectively. The prima facie 50 mph limit in New South Wales became a prima facie limit of 80 km/h.
New South Wales introduced an absolute speed limit of 100 km/h in 1979, replacing the prima facie limit of 80 km/h. The Northern Territory introduced an absolute speed limit of 110 km/h in 2007, along with 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph) zones on the Territory's four major highways.
