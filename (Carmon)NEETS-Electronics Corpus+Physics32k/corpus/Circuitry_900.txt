 
Design specification 
 
Having  determined  a  need  for  our  product  and 
obtained  a  detailed  list  of  requirements,  the  next 
stage  was  that  of  firming  up  the  design  brief  and 
producing  a  detailed  specification  for  the  power 
supply.  This  design  specification  was  a  detailed 
performance  specification  that  included  numerical 
values  for  relevant  parameters  (such  as  output 
voltage  and  output  current).  The  detailed  design 
specification  was  important  because  we  returned 
when  we  needed  to  confirm  that  our  prototype 
power supply met our requirements. We did this by 
comparing the measured performance specification 
with  the  original  design  specification.  Taking  into 
account  the  requirements  listed  above,  we  arrived 
at the following design specification:
