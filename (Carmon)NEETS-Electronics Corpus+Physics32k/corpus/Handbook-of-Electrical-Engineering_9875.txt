In our work thus far we have assumed that parameters were constant and known. Such is seldom the case,
and we must naturally be concerned with the effects of parameter variations, disturbances, and nonlinearities
upon system performance. Suppose, for example, that we design a system with a certain gain assumed as K1.
If the system operates open loop and the gain K1 is in cascade or series with the other input-output components,
then the overall transfer function changes by precisely the same factor as K1 changes. If we have an ampliÔ¨Åer
with  unity  ratio  feedback  around  a  gain  K1,  the  situation  is  much  different.  The  closed-loop  gain  would
nominally be K1/(1 + K1), and a change to 2K1 would give a closed-loop gain 2K1/(1 + 2K1). If K1 is large, say
103, then the new gain is 0.99950025, which is a percentage change of less than 0.05% for a change in gain of
100%.
