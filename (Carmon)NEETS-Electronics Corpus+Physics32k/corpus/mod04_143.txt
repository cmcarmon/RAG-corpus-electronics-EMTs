Items to be soldered should normally be "tinned" before making a mechanical connection. Tinning is 
the coating of the material to be soldered with a light coat of solder. When the surface has been properly 
cleaned, a thin, even coating of flux should be placed over the surface to be tinned. This will prevent 
oxidation while the part is being heated to soldering temperature. Rosin-core solder is usually preferred in 
electrical work. However, a separate rosin flux may be used instead. Separate rosin flux is frequently used 
when wires in cable fabrication are tinned.
