The angular compensation of thermal expansion requires at least two, and for full compensation even three, angular expansion joints. Angular expansion joints offer a wide variety of combination options in so-called two-hinge or three-hinge systems.
Single-plane three-hinged systems make do with one-sided angularly flexible expansion joints, while multi-plane three-hinged systems for absorbing thermal expansion in three axial directions require at least two gimbal expansion joints that are angularly flexible on all sides. The following basic rules apply to angular compensation:
Always at least two angular expansion joints are needed.
Angular expansion joints are always associated with multiple redirections of flow by 90Â°.
Because angular expansion joints (as hinged expansion joints) themselves absorb the compressive forces released by the bellows, the fixed points in the pipeline are only loaded by their adjusting forces and torques, by the frictional forces of the pipe guides and by the flow forces.
Angular compensation is specifically designed for complex multi-plane pipework.
