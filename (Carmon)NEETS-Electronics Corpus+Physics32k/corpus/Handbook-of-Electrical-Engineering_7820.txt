1Numerical aperture is deÔ¨Åned as NA = n sin q, where n is the refractive index of the image space, and q  is the half-angle
subtended by the exit pupil at the focal point. In optical recording systems the image space is air whose index is very nearly
unity; thus for all practical purposes NA = sin q.
