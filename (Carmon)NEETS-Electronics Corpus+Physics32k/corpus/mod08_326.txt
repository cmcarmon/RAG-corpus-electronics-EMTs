This circuitâ€™s operation is the same as for the single-input, single-output differential amplifier just
described. However, another output is obtained from the bottom of R2. As the input signal goes positive,
thus causing increased current through Q1, R2 has a greater voltage drop. The output signal at the bottom
of R2 therefore is negative going. A negative-going input signal will decrease current and reverse the
polarities of both output signals.
