and graphed in Figure 7.16 between the input voltage vGS and the MOSFET
current iDS. The output current and voltage must thus satisfy both the load-line
constraint and the MOSFET vDS versus iDS relationships. We can graphically
solve for the behavior of the output voltage by overlaying the load-line rela-
tionship on the iDS versus vDS characteristics of the MOSFET in the saturation
region as depicted in Figure 7.32.
