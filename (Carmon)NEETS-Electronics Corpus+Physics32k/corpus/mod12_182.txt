The amplitude of the audio-modulating voltage can also be determined from amplitude variations in 
the envelope pattern. Notice that the peak-to-peak variations in envelope amplitude (emax âˆ’ e min) is equal 
to 400 volts on the scale. Note then that the peak amplitude of the audio voltage is 200 volts. If these rf 
and audio voltage values are inserted into the equation, the pattern in figure 1-42 is found to represent 
50-percent modulation.
