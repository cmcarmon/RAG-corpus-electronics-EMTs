Many circuits are designed to operate at a cer-
tain voltage. If the voltage varies, the operation of 
the circuit is affected. Therefore, the power supply 
must produce the same output regardless of load and 
 input voltage changes. To accomplish this, a voltage 
 regulator is added after the filter.
