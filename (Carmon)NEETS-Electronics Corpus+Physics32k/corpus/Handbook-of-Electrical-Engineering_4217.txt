Signal and Data Processing
Digital processing is generally divided between two processing subsystems, i.e., signals and data, according to
the  algorithm  structure  and  throughput  demands.  Signal  processing  includes  pulse  compression,  Doppler
ﬁltering, and detection threshold estimation and testing. Data processing includes track ﬁltering, user interface
support, and such specialized functions as electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM) and built-in test (BIT),
as well as the resource management process required to control the radar system.
