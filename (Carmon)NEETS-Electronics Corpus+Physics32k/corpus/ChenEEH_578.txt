Thyristors come in various forms depending on the applica-
tion requirements. They can be made to handle large voltage
and current with low on-state forward drop. Such thyristors
typically ﬁnd applications in circuits requiring rectiﬁcation of
line frequency voltage and currents. Faster recovery thyristors
can be made at the expense of increased on-state voltage drop.
