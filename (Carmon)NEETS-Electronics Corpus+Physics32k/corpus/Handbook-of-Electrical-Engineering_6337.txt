As HDTV transitions from a proposed system to a commercially available product, you can expect information
to appear in a variety of places from the most esoteric research publications to popular business and entertain-
ment publications. During the development process, the best places to look are the IEEE publications (IEEE,
NY) and the broadcasting industry journals. The IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting and the IEEE Transactions
on Consumer Electronics continue to have periodic articles relating to the HDTV standards and implementation
of these standards. Another source of information, though not overly technical, is the periodical Broadcasting
and Cable (Cahners Publishing, NY).
