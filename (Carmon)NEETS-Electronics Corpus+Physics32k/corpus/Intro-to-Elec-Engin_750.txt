The ampliﬁers discussed in Sections 8.3 and 8.4 as well as in this section are small-signal
linear stages that use capacitance coupling. These are also known as RC ampliﬁers since their
circuits need only resistors and capacitors. There are of course other transistor ampliﬁers that do
not have the small-signal limitation and are also not limited to the use of resistors and capacitors
in their circuits. For larger input signals the linear dependence of the current on the signal level
may not be maintained.
