which are thin boards designed to house a permanent circuit. Pin 
headers come in handy for complex electronics projects that involve 
multiple circuit boards. Most pin headers consist of one or two rows of 
metal posts attached to a block of plastic that you mount on the circuit 
board. You connect the pin header to individual or bundled wires, or to 
a compatible connector at the end of a ribbon cable — a series of insu-
lated wires stuck together side by side to form a flat, flexible cable. The 
 rectangular shape of the connector allows easy routing of signals from 
each wire in the cable to the correct part of the circuit board. You refer 
to pin headers by the number of pins (posts) they use, such as a 40‐pin 
header.
