The desire to communicate directly by voice, at a higher rate of speed than possible through basic 
telegraphy, led to further research. That research led to the development of MODULATION. Modulation 
is the ability to impress intelligence upon a TRANSMISSION MEDIUM, such as radio waves. A 
transmission medium can be described as light, smoke, sound, wire lines, or radio-frequency waves. In 
this module, you will study the basic principles of modulation and DEMODULATION (removing 
intelligence from the medium).
