The ﬁeld of very large scale integrated (VLSI) signal processing
concerns the design and implementation of signal processing
algorithms using application-speciﬁc VLSI architecture, in-
cluding programmable digital signal processors and dedicated
signal processors implemented with VLSI technology. In this
chapter, we survey important developments in this ﬁeld, in-
cluding algorithm design, architecture development, and
design methodology.
