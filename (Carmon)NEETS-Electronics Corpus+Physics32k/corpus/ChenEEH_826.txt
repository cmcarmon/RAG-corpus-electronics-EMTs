Temperature Sensor
The temperature sensor we used is a platinum resistor made
in thin-layer technology on Al2O3 substrate. We use a 1-kV
sensor with a temperature sensitivity (Tk) of 3:85  103=8C (as
speciﬁed in IEC 751). These sensors are quite popular in
automotive applications. This results in low cost and good
availability of subcomponents. The sensor is used in a voltage
divider together with the constant resistor Rﬁx. The tempera-
ture information is represented in the output voltage Uout.
The multinature property is thus obvious as shown in
Figure 3.13.
