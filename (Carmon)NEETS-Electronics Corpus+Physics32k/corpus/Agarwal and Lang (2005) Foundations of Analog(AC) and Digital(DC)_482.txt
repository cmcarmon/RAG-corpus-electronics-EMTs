V1G1a + V2G1b + ··· + I1 + ··· = e1G11 + e2G12 + ···
V1G2a + ···
V1G3a + ···
These have been written in the standard form, with source terms on the
left in each equation. All of the unknown variables appear on the right side, each
multiplied by conductances: the sum of the appropriate ‘‘self ’’ conductances
for terms along the main diagonal, and the sum of the appropriate ‘‘mutual’’
conductances elsewhere.
