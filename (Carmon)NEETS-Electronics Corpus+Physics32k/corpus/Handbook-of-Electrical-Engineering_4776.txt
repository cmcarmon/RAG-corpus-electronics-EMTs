It requires charge to rotate or ﬂip a domain. Thus, there is charge ﬂow associated with the rearrangement
of the polarization in the ferroelectric material. If a bipolar, repetitive signal is applied to a ferroelectric material,
its hysteresis loop is traced out and the charge in the circuit can be measured using the Sawyer Tower circuit
(Fig. 49.4).  In  some  cases  the  drive  signal  to  the  material  is  not  repetitive  and  only  a  single  cycle  is  used.  In
that case the starting point and the end point do not have the same polarization value and the hysteresis curve
will not close on itself.
