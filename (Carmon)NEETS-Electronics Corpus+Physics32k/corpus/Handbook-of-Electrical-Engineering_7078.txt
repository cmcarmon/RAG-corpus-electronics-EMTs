Common information sources like speech produce continuous waveforms, not discrete sequences of random
variables  as  in  the  models  we  have  been  considering  so  far.  By  sampling  the  signal  at  twice  the  maximum
frequency  present  (the  Nyquist  rate),  however,  we  convert  the  continuous  time  signal  into  a  set  of  discrete
samples from which the original signal can be recovered (the sampling theorem). We can then apply the theory
of rate distortion and vector quantization to such waveform sources as well.
