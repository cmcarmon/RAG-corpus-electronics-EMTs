The key feature of IBDM is that it is a fully computer controlled mechanism having in the following SAFE advantages:
Smooth: IBDM provides the capability for low impact docking and berthing. Low impact docking means that the contact forces during mating are greatly reduced and as a result this alleviates the large loads that the structure is required to withstand and it eliminates the need for impact energy to achieve spacecraft interface alignment and capture. Low impact berthing means that the SCS mating forces are smaller than the IDSS requirement, making it possible to perform berthing within the force limits of the robotic arm on station.
Autonomous: the IBDM comprises autonomous fast switch-over from primary to redundant lane in case of a single failure and from redundant lane to safe mode (described below) in case of two failures. This switch-over is performed at IBDM level and does not require the vehicle avionics to be in the loop.
Flexible: a large range of vehicle mass properties can be handled, as the SCS uses configurable active control, making it possible to be used for a wide variety of applications ranging from explorations to resupply missions.
Effective: a very high capture success rate (> 98%), enabled by an agile force-sensing controlled capture mode. As a result, IBDM can cope with the full range of initial conditions specified in the IDSS.
SAFE: the IBDM comprises a backup or safe mode in which the Steward platform behaves like an electro-magnetic damper. This mode is used if two failures have occurred in the IBDM avionics - or on command by the hosting vehicle - or in case no electrical power is applied to the IBDM, and hence provides a safe situation for both the vehicle and the ISS, even during the docking phase.
