The postwar years were ones of growth and change, accompanied by tensions and conﬂicts both within
the  engineering  community  and  in  society  at  large.  The  war  was,  again,  followed  by  unprecedented
prosperity, but at this time it was in a world where the dangers and possible consequences of international
conﬂict were distressingly obvious. The efforts of engineers were, therefore, divided between the creation
of a consumer society, powered by electricity and tuned by electronics, and the demands of national and
international security. Alongside this division was another division of the engineering community. The
split  between  the  AIEE  and  the  IRE  became  less  and  less  justiﬁable  and  in  the  coming  decades,  this
problem was solved, as engineers everywhere recognized their common interests. (Courtesy of the IEEE
