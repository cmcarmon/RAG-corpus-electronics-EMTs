Say there is some observable quantity Q which depends on position, momentum and time,




Q
=
Q
(
x
,
p
,
t
)



{\displaystyle Q=Q(x,p,t)\,}


And also, that there is a wave function which obeys Schrödinger's equation




i
ℏ



∂
ψ


∂
t



=
H
ψ
.



{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial t}}=H\psi .\,}


Taking the time derivative of the expectation value of Q requires use of the product rule, and results in

So finally,
