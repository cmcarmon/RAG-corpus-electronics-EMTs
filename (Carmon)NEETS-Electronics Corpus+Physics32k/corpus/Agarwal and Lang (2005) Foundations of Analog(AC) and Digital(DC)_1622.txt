Notice that the dynamic power dissipated is proportional to the frequency with
which the input signal transitions. Not surprisingly, high-performance chips
that clock at high frequencies dissipate a lot of power. Also notice that the
power is related to the square of the supply voltage. As clock speeds of VLSI
chips increase, power considerations are causing manufacturers to continually
reduce the supply voltages. Whereas 5-volt power supplies were the norm in
the 80s, voltages closer to 3 volts have been the norm in the 90s, and supplies
closer to 1.5 volts have been commonplace after the year 2000.
