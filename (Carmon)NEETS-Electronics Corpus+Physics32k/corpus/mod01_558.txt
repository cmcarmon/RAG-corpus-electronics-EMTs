The discussion of electrical circuits presented up to this point has been concerned with series circuits
in which there is only one path for current. There is another basic type of circuit known as the
PARALLEL CIRCUIT with which you must become familiar. Where the series circuit has only one path
for current, the parallel circuit has more than one path for current.
