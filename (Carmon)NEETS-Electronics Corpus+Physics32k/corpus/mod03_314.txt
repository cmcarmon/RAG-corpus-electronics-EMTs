Some other circuits and devices have a large current for short periods and a normal (smaller) current
most of the time. An electric motor, for instance, will draw a large current when the motor starts, but
normal operating current for the motor will be much smaller. A fuse used to protect a motor would have
to allow for this large temporary current, but would open if the large current were to continue.
