for a speciﬁc choice of the parameters q1, q2, …, qp. These p parameters shall be compactly represented by the
parameter vector u ˛ R p. The set of all matrices that can be represented in this fashion is designated by  } and
is said to have a structure induced by the functions aij (u) and to have p degrees of freedom. If the functions
aij (u) are linearly dependent on the parameters, the matrix class } is said to have a linear structure.
