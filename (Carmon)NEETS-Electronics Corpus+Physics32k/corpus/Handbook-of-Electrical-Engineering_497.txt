Introduction
Normalized element values are given here for both singly and doubly terminated ﬁlters. The source and load
resistors  are  normalized  to  1 W.  Scaling  rules  will  be  given  in  Section  4.4  that  will  allow  these  values  to  be
modiﬁed to any speciﬁed impedance value and to any cut-off frequency desired. In addition, we will cover the
transformation of these low-pass ﬁlters to high-pass or bandpass ﬁlters.
