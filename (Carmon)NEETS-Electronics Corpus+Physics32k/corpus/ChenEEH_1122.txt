The MEMS structures and devices that result from the se-
quence of design, simulation,
fabrication, packaging, and
testing can be classiﬁed into four major groups. The ﬁrst
includes passive, or nonmoving, structures. The second and
third involve sensors and actuators that have micromechani-
cal components. These are conceptually reciprocal: sensors
respond to the world and provide information and actuators
use information to inﬂuence something in the world. The
fourth class includes systems that integrate both sensors
and actuators to provide some useful function. This classi-
ﬁcation, like most, is imperfect. For example, some devices
that are dominantly sensors have actuators built into them for
self-testing. Air bag triggers are an example. However, the
taxonomy provides a simple but quite comprehensive frame-
work for considering MEMS devices.
