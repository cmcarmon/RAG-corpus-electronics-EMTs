General Approaches
Time Domain Coders and Linear Prediction
Linear  Predictive  Coding  (LPC)  is  a  modeling  technique  that  has  seen  widespread  application  among  time-
domain speech coders, largely because it is computationally simple and applicable to the mechanisms involved
in speech production. In LPC, general spectral characteristics are described by a parametric model based on
autoregressive
estimates of autocorrelations or autocovariances. The model of choice for speech is the all-pole or

an all-pole transfer function. In this case, the estimated LPC model parameters correspond to an AR process
which can produce waveforms very similar to the original speech segment. Differential Pulse Code Modulation
(DPCM)  coders  (i.e.,  ITU-T  G.721  ADPCM  [CCITT,  1984])  and  LPC  vocoders  (i.e.,  U.S.  Federal  Standard
1015 [National Communications System, 1984]) are examples of this class of time-domain predictive architec-
ture. Code Excited Coders (i.e., ITU-T G728 [Chen, 1990] and U.S. Federal Standard 1016 [National Commu-
nications System, 1991]) also utilize LPC spectral modeling techniques.
