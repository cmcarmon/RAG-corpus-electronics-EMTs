Although the power spectrum quantiÔ¨Åes activity at each electrode, other vari-
ables  derivable  from  FFT  offer  a  measure  of  the  relationship  between  activity
recorded at distinct electrode sites. Coherence (which is a complex number), cal-
culated from the cross-spectrum analysis of two signals, is similar to cross-corre-
  values  range  from  1  to  0,  indicating
lation  in  the  time  domain.  The 
maximum  or  no  synchrony,  respectively,  and  are  independent  of  power.  The  temporal  relationship  between
two signals is expressed by phase, which is a measure of the lag between two signals for common frequency
(cid:176)
(cid:176)
 indicating no time lag between signals or 180
components or bands. Phase is expressed in units of degrees, 0
if the signals are of opposite polarity. Phase can also be transformed into the time domain, giving a measure
of the time difference between two frequencies.
