Relationship  (14.107)  provides  the  mapping  corresponding  to  the  attribute  set  C+.  Implementation  of  the
mapping associated with attribute set CTH is a straightforward modiﬁcation of Toeplitz mapping (14.120). In
particular, the mean value of the elements of the two diagonals equispaced k units above and below the main
diagonal is employed to determine the constant element used in the Toeplitz-Hermitian approximation where
0 £ k £ n – 1.
