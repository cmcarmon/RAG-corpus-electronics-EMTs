the resonant structures in the short-term speech spectrum. In
particular, the resonances associated with a speech sound are a
consequence of the articulators having formed various acous-
tical cavities and subcavities out of the vocal tract cavities,
much like concatenating different
lengths of organ pipe
in various orders. Thus, the center frequencies of these reson-
ances depend on the shape and physical dimensions of the
vocal tract. Conversely, each vocal-tract shape is characterized
by a set of resonant frequencies. From a modeling point of
view, the vocal-tract articulators determine the important
‘‘pole’’ properties of the speech system. Since these resonances
tend to ‘‘form’’ (impose an envelope upon) the spectrum,
speech scientists refer to them as formants. This term is
often used to refer to the nominal center frequencies of the
resonances, so formant may be used interchangeably with
formant frequency. The formants in the spectrum are denoted3
as F1, F2, F3, . . ., FN , beginning with the lowest frequency. In
practice, there are usually three to ﬁve discernable formants in
the Nyquist band for typical sampling rates (8–16 kHz).
