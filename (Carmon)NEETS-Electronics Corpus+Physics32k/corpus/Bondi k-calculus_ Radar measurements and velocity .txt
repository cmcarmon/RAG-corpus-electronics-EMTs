In the k-calculus methodology, distances are measured using radar. An observer sends a radar pulse towards a target and receives an echo from it. The radar pulse (which travels at



c


{\displaystyle c}
, the speed of light) travels a total distance, there and back, that is twice the distance to the target, and takes time




T

−

T

1




{\displaystyle T_{2}-T_{1}}
, where




T

1




{\displaystyle T_{1}}
and




T

2




{\displaystyle T_{2}}
are times recorded by the observer's clock at transmission and reception of the radar pulse. This implies that the distance to the target is





x

c
(

T

T

)
.


{\displaystyle x_{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}c(T_{2}-T_{1}).}

Furthermore, since the speed of light is the same in both directions, the time at which the radar pulse arrives at the target must be, according to the observer, halfway between the transmission and reception times, namely





t

A


=



1
2



(

T

2


+

T

)
.


{\displaystyle t_{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(T_{2}+T_{1}).}

In the particular case where the radar observer is Alice and the target is Bob (momentarily co-located with Dave) as described previously, by k-calculus we have




T

=

k

T

{\displaystyle T_{2}=k^{2}T_{1}}
, and so

{\displaystyle x_{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}c(k^{2}-1)T_{1}}

(

k

+

)

T

.


{\displaystyle t_{A}={\tfrac {1}{2}}(k^{2}+1)T_{1}.}

As Alice and Bob were co-located at




t

A


=
0
,

x

A


=
0


{\displaystyle t_{A}=0,x_{A}=0}
, the velocity of Bob relative to Alice is given by




v

{\displaystyle v={\frac {x_{A}}{t_{A}}}={\frac {{\tfrac {1}{2}}c(k^{2}-1)T_{1}}{{\tfrac {1}{2}}(k^{2}+1)T_{1}}}=c{\frac {k^{2}-1}{k^{2}+1}}=c{\frac {k-k^{-1}}{k+k^{-1}}}.}

This equation expresses velocity as a function of the Bondi k-factor. It can be solved for
