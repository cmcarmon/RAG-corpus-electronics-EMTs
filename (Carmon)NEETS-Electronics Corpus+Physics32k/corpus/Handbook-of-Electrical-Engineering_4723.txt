If an acoustic plane wave as in Eq. (48.2) propagating within one medium strikes an interface with another
medium, there will be reﬂection and transmission, much as in the corresponding case in optics. To satisfy the
boundary conditions at the interface, it will be necessary in general to generate three transmitted modes and
three  reﬂected  modes.  Thus,  the  concepts  of  reﬂection  and  transmission  coefﬁcients  for  planar  interfaces
between anisotropic media are complicated. In many propagation and excitation geometries, however, one can

consider only one independent pure mode with energy ﬂow parallel to 
k
  or  perpendicular  to  it.  This  mode  (plane  wave)  then  propagates  along  the  axis  or  its  negative  in
along 
Eq. (48.2). Discussion of the generation, propagation, and reﬂection of this wave is greatly assisted by consid-
ering analogies to the one-dimensional electrical transmission line.
