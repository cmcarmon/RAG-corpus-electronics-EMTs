14.3.8 A signal (with P = 1 µW and B = 250 kHz)
contaminated by white noise at noise temperature
T = 2T0 is applied to an ampliﬁer. Obtain the
condition on Ta such that Pout/Nout ≥ 80.8 dB.
14.3.9 The noise ﬁgure of an ampliﬁer is given by F =
1 + Ta/T0. Express the output signal-to-noise
ratio in terms of F, input noise power N, and
input noise temperature T. See how the result is
simpliﬁed when T = T0.
14.3.10 A system for measuring the constant signal value
x has Pout/Nout = 40 dB and B = 8 Hz. In order
to obtain an accuracy of ±0.2%, how long must
the output be observed?
14.3.11 An ampliﬁer has a noise equivalent bandwidth B
= 25 kHz and a maximum available power gain
of G = 30 dB. If its output noise power is 108kT0,
determine the effective noise temperature and the
noise ﬁgure (given by F = 1 + Ta/T0). Assume
the input noise source temperature to be T0.
