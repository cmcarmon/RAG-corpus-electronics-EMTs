Applications of junction diodes are possible for switches, de-
modulators, rectiÔ¨Åers, limiters, (variable) capacitors, nonlinear
resistors, level shifters, and frequency generation. Special diode
types exist that are optimized for the particular application.
The cross-section of a discrete diode is shown in Figure 5.1(A);
diode structures in integrated circuits also contain a parasitic
junction.
