When the total position-spread tensor is partitioned according to spin (SP-TPS), it becomes a powerful tool to describe spin delocalization in the insulating regime. In Figure 4 is shown the longitudinal SP-TPS (Λ∥) computed at full configuration interaction level for the H2 diatomic molecule. The horizontal line at 0 bohr2 divides the same spin (positive values) and different spin (negative values) contributions of the spin partitioned TPS. Unlike the SS-TPS that saturates to the atomic value for R>5, the SP-TPS diverges as R2 indicating that there is a strong spin delocalization. The SP-TPS can also be seen as a measure of how strong the electron correlation is.
