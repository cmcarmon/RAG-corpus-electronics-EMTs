The accident happened when an express train from Tabriz to Mashhad stopped because of technical problems associated with cold weather between Semnan and Damghan. The second express train, which was travelling from Semnan to Mashhad on the same track, was ordered to stop by the dispatcher, and the signals turned red. The shift for the dispatcher changed before the problem with the first train was resolved. At this point, the second train asked for permission to resume its journey which was then approved by the new dispatcher. The second train gained full speed, then hit the first train from behind. As a result of the collision four carriages derailed; two of them caught fire. Forty-seven passengers and crew from both trains were reported dead, and more than 100 reported injured. The injured were taken to hospitals in Semnan and Damghan.
