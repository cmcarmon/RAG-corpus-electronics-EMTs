Both the Armstrong and the Hartley oscillators have a tendency to be unstable in frequency because 
of junction capacitance. In comparison, the COLPITTS OSCILLATOR has fairly good frequency 
stability, is easy to tune, and can be used for a wide range of frequencies. The large value of split 
capacitance is in parallel with the junctions and minimizes the effect on frequency stability.
