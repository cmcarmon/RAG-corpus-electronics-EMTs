The circuit shown in figure 3-38 is only able to use half of the load voltage (and therefore half the
possible load power) since the diode blocks current during half the load-voltage cycle. A full-wave
rectifier used in place of CR1 would allow current flow during the entire cycle of load voltage while still
preventing hysteresis loss.
