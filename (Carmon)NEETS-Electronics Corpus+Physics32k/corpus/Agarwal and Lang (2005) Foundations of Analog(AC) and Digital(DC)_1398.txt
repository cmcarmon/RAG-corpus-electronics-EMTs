The initial condition together with a continuity condition, can now be applied
to evaluate A. The continuity condition for inductor current can be found from
Equation 9.28. If it can be shown that the inductor voltage cannot be infinite
in the circuit, then di/dt must be finite, hence the inductor current must be
continuous. For this particular circuit, with finite vS, we are assured of finite vL,
hence iL in Equation 10.57 can be evaluated at t = 0, and set equal to the initial
value, Equation 10.45:
