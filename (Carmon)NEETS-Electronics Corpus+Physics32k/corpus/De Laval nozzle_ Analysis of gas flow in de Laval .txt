The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:
For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas.
The gas flow is isentropic (i.e., at constant entropy). As a result, the flow is reversible (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and adiabatic (i.e., there is no heat gained or lost).
The gas flow is constant (i.e., steady) during the period of the propellant burn.
The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit (i.e., along the nozzle's axis of symmetry)
The gas flow behaviour is compressible since the flow is at very high velocities (Mach number > 0.3).
