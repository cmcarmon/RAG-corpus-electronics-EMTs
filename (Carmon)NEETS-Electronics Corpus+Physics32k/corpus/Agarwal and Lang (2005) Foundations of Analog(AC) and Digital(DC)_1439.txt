and VOH to be the same as those used in Section 10.4.2. In other words, VOH = 4V
and VOL = 1V.
When the input VIN1 transitions from high to low, Figure 10.26 applies, and we can
use the results from Section 10.4.2 to compute the propagation delay tpd,1→0 by using
(RL + Rwire) in place of RL and (CGS2 + Cwire) in place of CGS2. Thus, the propagation
delay for RL = 10 k, RON = 1 k, CGS2 = 100 fF is given by
tpd,1→0 = −(RL + Rwire) × (CGS2 + Cwire) ln(11/50)
