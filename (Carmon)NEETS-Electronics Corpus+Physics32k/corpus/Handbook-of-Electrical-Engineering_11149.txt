The measurement of blood pressure and blood ﬂow in humans and other animals remains a difﬁcult problem
in biomedical sensing. Direct blood pressure measurement refers to evaluation of the blood pressure using a
sensor that is in contact with the blood being measured or contacts it through an intermediate ﬂuid such as a
physiologic saline solution. Direct blood pressure sensors are invasive. Indirect blood pressure measurement
involves a sensor that does not actually contact the blood. The most familiar indirect blood pressure measure-
ment  is  the  sphygmomanometer  cuff  that  is  usually  used  in  most  medical  examinations.  It  is  a  noninvasive
instrument. Until recently, the primary sensor used for direct blood pressure measurement was the unbonded
strain  gauge  pressure  transducer  shown  in  Fig.  114.1.  The  basic  principle  of  this  device  is  that  a  differential
pressure seen across a diaphragm will cause that diaphragm to deﬂect. This deﬂection is then measured by a
displacement  transducer.  In  the  unbonded  strain  gauge  sensor  a  closed  chamber  is  covered  by  a  ﬂexible
diaphragm. This diaphragm is attached to a structure that has four ﬁne gauge wires drawn between it and the
chamber walls. A dome with the appropriate hardware for coupling to a pressure source covers the diaphragm
on the side opposite the chamber such that when the pressure in the dome exceeds the pressure in the chamber,
the diaphragm is deﬂected into the chamber. This causes two of the ﬁne wires to stretch by a small amount
while the other two wires contract by the same amount. The electrical resistance of the wires that are stretched
increases  while  that  of  the  wires  that  contract  decreases.  By  connecting  these  wires,  or  more  correctly  these
unbonded  strain  gauges,  into  a  Wheatstone  bridge  circuit,  a  voltage  proportional  to  the  deﬂection  of  the
diaphragm can be obtained.
