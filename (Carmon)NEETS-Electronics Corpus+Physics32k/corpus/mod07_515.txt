Recall that a Zener diode is a diode that block current until a specified voltage is applied. Remember 
also that the applied voltage is called the breakdown, or Zener voltage. Zener diodes are available with 
different Zener voltages. When the Zener voltage is reached, the Zener diode conducts from its anode to 
its cathode (with the direction of the arrow).
