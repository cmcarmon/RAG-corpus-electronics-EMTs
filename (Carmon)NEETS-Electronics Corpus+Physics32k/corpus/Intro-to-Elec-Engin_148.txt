1.4.4 A DMM (digital multimeter) reads true rms values
of current. If the peak value of each of the follow-
ing periodic current waves is 5 A, Ô¨Ånd the meter
reading for: (a) a sine wave, (b) a square wave, (c)
a triangular wave, and (d) a sawtooth wave.
1.4.5 Consider the bridge circuit given in Figure P1.4.5
with R1 = 24 k, R2 = 48 k, and R3 = 10 k.
Find R4 when the bridge is balanced with V1 = 0.
*1.4.6 In the Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in Figure
P1.4.6, R1 = 16 , R2 = 8 , and R3 = 40 ; R4
