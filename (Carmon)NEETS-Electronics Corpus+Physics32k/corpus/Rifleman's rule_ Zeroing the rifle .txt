Let



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
be the bore angle required to compensate for the bullet drop caused by gravity. Standard practice is for the shooter to zero their rifle at a standard range, such as 100 or 200 meters. Once the rifle is zeroed, adjustments to



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
are made for other ranges relative to this zero setting. One can calculate



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
using standard Newtonian dynamics as follows (for more details on this topic, see Trajectory).
Two equations can be set up that describe the bullet's flight in a vacuum, (presented for computational simplicity compared to solving equations describing trajectories in an atmosphere).

(Equation 5)
The zero range,




R

H




{\displaystyle R_{H}}
, is important because corrections due to elevation differences will be expressed in terms of changes to the horizontal zero range.
For most rifles,



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
is quite small. For example, the standard 7.62 mm (0.308 in) NATO bullet is fired with a muzzle velocity of 853 m/s (2800 ft/s). For a rifle zeroed at 100 meters, this means that



δ
θ
=

0.039

∘




{\displaystyle \delta \theta =0.039^{\circ }}
.
While this definition of



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
is useful in theoretical discussions, in practice



δ
θ


{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
must also account for the fact that the rifle sight is actually mounted above the barrel by several centimeters. This fact is important in practice, but is not required to understand the rifleman's rule.
