Values of  hFE and hfe can be obtained from the 
transfer  characteristic  (IC plotted  against  IB) as 
shown in Figs 5.23 and 5.24. Note that hFE is found 
from corresponding static values while hfe is found 
by measuring the slope of the graph. Also note that, 
if the transfer characteristic is linear, there is little 
(if any) difference between hFE and hfe.
