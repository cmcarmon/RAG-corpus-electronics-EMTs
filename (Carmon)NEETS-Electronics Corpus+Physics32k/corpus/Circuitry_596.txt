Example 13.4 
 
A radio  wave  has  a  frequency  of  162.5  kHz.  If  a 
beat  frequency  of  1.25  kHz  is  to  be  obtained, 
determine the two possible BFO frequencies. 
 
Solution 
 
The  BFO  can  be  above  or  below  the  incoming 
signal frequency by an amount that is equal to the 
beat  frequency  (i.e.  the  audible  signal  that  results
