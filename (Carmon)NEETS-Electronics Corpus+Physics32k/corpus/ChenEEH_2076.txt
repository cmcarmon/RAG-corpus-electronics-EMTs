A schema SC can be used to deÔ¨Åne an operation, called an
operation schema in the sequel, which includes both a state
schema name S and its version S0
in its declaration part.
However, DS or JS is often used instead of S and S0. The
predicate part can be divided into the precondition part (de-
noted by pre-SC in the sequel) and the postcondition part
(denoted by post-SC in the sequel).
