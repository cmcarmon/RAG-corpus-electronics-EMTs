Such characteristics simplify the design process considerably
and open the door for design automation. Another major
attractor for SCMOS, the main concern of this chapter, is its
low-power consumption feature. The static power consump-
tion component is almost absent in the steady-state operation
mode, except for some leakage that is mentioned in Section
5.3. The world of the SCMOS, however, is not so perfect; there
are some disadvantages associated with SCMOS circuit style,
more speciÔ¨Åcally performance and number of transistors. The
SCMOS design family has almost double the number of tran-
sistors compared to other families and has inferior perform-
ance especially when compared to dynamic CMOS (DCMOS)
style. Figure 5.20 compares the general structure for SCMOS
and DCMOS styles.
