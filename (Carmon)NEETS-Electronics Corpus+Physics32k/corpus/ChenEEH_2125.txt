Waves propagating in a homogeneous isotropic region are
usually in the form of plane-waves. Chapter 3 describes the
basic properties of plane waves for both lossless and lossy
media. These basic properties include the nature of the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds, the properties of the wave number vector,
and the power ﬂow of the plane wave. Special attention is given
to the speciﬁc case of a homogenous (uniform) plane wave,
i.e., one having real direction angles because this case is most
often met in practice. Properties such as wavelength, phase and
group velocity, penetration depth, and polarization are dis-
cussed for these plane waves.
