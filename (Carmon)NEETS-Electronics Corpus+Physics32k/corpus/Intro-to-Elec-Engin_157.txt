(b) The 96-V source with 48  in series can be replaced by a current source of 96/48 = 2
A with a parallel resistance of 48 . Thus, by using source transformation, in terms
of current sources, the equivalent circuit to the left of terminals a–b is given in Figure
E2.1.1(e).
Shorting terminals a–b, one can ﬁnd Isc, Isc = 8 A. Replacing current sources by
open circuits, viewed from terminals a–b, RTh = 48(cid:8)24 = 16 , which is the same as in
part (a). The circuit of Figure E2.1.1(e) to the left of terminals a–b reduces to that shown
in Figure E2.1.1(f).
