The method described in the previous paragraphs for per-
forming a partial derived signature checking CFC (partial
CFC, for brevity) was implemented for a processor system
with an internal cache for a Motorola 68040 processor. The
processor’s initial VHDL description was obtained from
(Heishman et al.). It was augmented greatly and various struc-
tural descriptions were added to the original behavioral de-
scription for CFC and partial CFC implementations (Rota,
2002; Trovo, 2002). A cache-less 68040 (or equivalently a
68040 with an external cache) was also simulated with the
WD then being able to monitor the program ﬂow completely
and thus perform a full CFC. The two different WDs were also
described in VHDL. Simulations performed show that the
error coverage for K ¼ 2 of the partial CFC scheme for an
internal cache system is almost as good as that for full CFC.
This result is shown in Figure 8.15 for two and four faults
