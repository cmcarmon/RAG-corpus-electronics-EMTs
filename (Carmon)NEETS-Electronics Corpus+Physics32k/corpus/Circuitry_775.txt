Driving mains connected loads 
 
Control systems are often used in conjunction with 
mains  connected  loads.  Modern  solid-state  relays 
(SSRs)  offer  superior  performance  and  reliability 
when  compared  with  conventional  relays  in  such 
applications.  SSRs  are  available  in  a  variety  of 
encapsulations  (including  DIL,  SIL,  flat-pack,  and 
plug-in  octal)  and  may  be  rated  for  RMS  currents 
between l A and 40 A.
