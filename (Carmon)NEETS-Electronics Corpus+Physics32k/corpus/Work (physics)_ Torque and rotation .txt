A force couple results from equal and opposite forces, acting on two different points of a rigid body. The sum (resultant) of these forces may cancel, but their effect on the body is the couple or torque T. The work of the torque is calculated as




d
W
=

T

⋅



ω
→



d
t
,


{\displaystyle dW=\mathbf {T} \cdot {\vec {\omega }}dt,}

where the T ⋅ ω is the power over the instant δt. The sum of these small amounts of work over the trajectory of the rigid body yields the work,

T

d

.


{\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {T} \cdot {\vec {\omega }}dt.}

This integral is computed along the trajectory of the rigid body with an angular velocity ω that varies with time, and is therefore said to be path dependent.
If the angular velocity vector maintains a constant direction, then it takes the form,







ω

ϕ

S

,


{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}={\dot {\phi }}\mathbf {S} ,}

where φ is the angle of rotation about the constant unit vector S. In this case, the work of the torque becomes,

where C is the trajectory from φ(t1) to φ(t2). This integral depends on the rotational trajectory φ(t), and is therefore path-dependent.
If the torque T is aligned with the angular velocity vector so that,





T

S

{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\tau \mathbf {S} ,}

and both the torque and angular velocity are constant, then the work takes the form,

{\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\tau {\dot {\phi }}dt=\tau (\phi _{2}-\phi _{1}).}


This result can be understood more simply by considering the torque as arising from a force of constant magnitude F, being applied perpendicularly to a lever arm at a distance r, as shown in the figure. This force will act through the distance along the circular arc s = rφ, so the work done is




W

{\displaystyle W=Fs=Fr\phi .}

Introduce the torque τ = Fr, to obtain




W

{\displaystyle W=Fr\phi =\tau \phi ,}

as presented above.
Notice that only the component of torque in the direction of the angular velocity vector contributes to the work.
