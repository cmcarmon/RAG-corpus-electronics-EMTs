The TRUE BEARING (referenced to true north) of a radar target is the angle between true north and
a line pointed directly at the target. This angle is measured in the horizontal plane and in a clockwise
direction from true north. The bearing angle to the radar target may also be measured in a clockwise
direction from the centerline of your own ship or aircraft and is referred to as the RELATIVE BEARING.
Both true and relative bearing angles are illustrated in figure 1-8.
