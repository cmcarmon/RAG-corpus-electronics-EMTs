Trackball
As  noted  previously,  the  trackball  uses  technology  similar  to  the  mouse,  but  preceded  it  as  an  input  device.
Thus, the comment that it is an upside-down mouse should be reversed. The movable element is housed in
an  assembly  as  is  shown  in  Fig. 89.9,  and  the  assembly  remains  stationary  so  that  much  less  desk  space  is
required  than  for  the  mouse.  In  addition,  the  trackball  may  be  mounted  on  a  keyboard  so  that  very  little
additional desk space is needed. The movable element can be the same as used in the mouse, and the output
can  be  a  set  of  bits  corresponding  to  the  coordinates  to  which  the  cursor  should  be  driven,  or  where  the
command should be carried out. The output format is essentially equivalent to that used for the mouse, and
the same protocols are used.
