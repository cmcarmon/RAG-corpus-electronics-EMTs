The Current Mirror as a Load
A second current mirror may be used as a load for the difference ampliﬁer, as shown in Fig. 24.42. This must
utilize pnp transistor structures so that the Q6 collector loads the Q2 collector with a large incremental resistance
rce(6), making for an extremely high voltage gain. Furthermore, Q5 and Q6 combine the signal output currents
of both Q1 and Q2 to perform a double-ended–to–single-ended conversion as follows. Taking signal currents,
