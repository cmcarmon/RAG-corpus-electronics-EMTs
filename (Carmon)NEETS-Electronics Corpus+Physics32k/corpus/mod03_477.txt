The automobile distributor cap and rotor are an example of the simplest form of an automatic rotary
switch. Figure 3-7 shows a portion of an automobile ignition system with the distributor cap and rotor
shown. The rotor is the portion of this switch that moves (rotates) and selects the circuit (spark plug). The
rotor does not actually touch the contacts going to the spark plugs, but the signal (spark) jumps the gap
between the rotor and the contacts. This switch has one input (the rotor) and six positions (one for each
spark plug). The schematic diagram for this rotary switch is shown below the illustration of the distributor
cap.
