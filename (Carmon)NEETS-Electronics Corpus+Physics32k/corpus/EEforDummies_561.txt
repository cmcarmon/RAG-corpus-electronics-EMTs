Identifying with diodes
Most diodes originating in North America are identified by five‐ or six‐digit 
codes that are part of an industry‐standard identification system. The first two 
digits are always 1N for diodes; the 1 specifies the number of pn‐junctions, 
the N signifies semiconductor, and the remaining three or four digits indicate 
 specific features of the diode. A classic example is the series of rectifier diodes 
identified as 1N40xx, where xx could be 00, 01, and so forth through 08. They 
are rated at 1 amp with PRV ratings ranging from 50 to 1,000 V, depending on 
the xx number. For instance, the 1N4001 rectifier diode is rated at 1 A and 50 V, 
and the 1N4007 is rated at 1 A and 1,000 V. Diodes in the 1N54xx series have a 
3‐A rating with PRV ratings from 50 to 1,000 V. You can readily find such infor­
mation in any catalog of electronic components or cross‐ reference book of 
diode data, generally found online. (A cross‐reference book tells you what parts 
can be substituted for other parts, in case a part specified in a circuit diagram 
is not available from your chosen source.)
