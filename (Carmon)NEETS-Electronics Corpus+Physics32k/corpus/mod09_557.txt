Compare the input wave shape of figure 4-18, view (B), with the output wave shape. Note the 
following important points: (1) The peak-to-peak amplitude of the input wave shape has not been changed 
by the clamper circuit; (2) the shape of the output wave shape has not been significantly changed from 
that of the input by the action of the clamper circuit; and (3) the output wave shape is now all above 0 
volts whereas the input wave shape is both above and below 0 volts. Thus, the lower part of the input 
wave shape has been clamped to a dc potential of 0 volts in the output. This circuit is referred to as a 
positive clamper since all of the output wave shape is above 0 volts and the bottom is clamped at 0 volts.
