Theorem 9. Let A be a Hermitian matrix contained in  Cn · n whose eigenanalysis is speciﬁed by relationship
(14.105). Furthermore, let the eigenvalues be ordered in the monotonically nonincreasing fashion l k ‡ l k +1 in
which  the  ﬁrst p  eigenvalues  are  positive  and  the  last n  –  p  are  nonpositive.  It  then  follows  that  the  SVD  of
Hermitian matrix A can be decomposed as
