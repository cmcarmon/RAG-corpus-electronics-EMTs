Further reduction of the remaining 36 piezoresistivity tensor components is obtained by applying the generating
elements  of  the  point  group  to  the  piezoresistivity  tensor  transformation  law  Eq.  (51.6)  and  demanding
invariance. The following are two commonly encountered piezoresistivity matrices:
