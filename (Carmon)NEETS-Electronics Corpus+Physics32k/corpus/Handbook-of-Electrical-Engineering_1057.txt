Convergence of the Fourier Series
The Fourier series representation of a periodic signal is an approximation that exhibits mean-squared conver-
gence to the true signal. If s(t) is a periodic signal of period T and s¢(t) denotes the Fourier series approximation
of s(t), then s(t) and s¢(t) are equal in the mean-squared sense if
