where A, B, and C are the lengths of the phasors drawn from the poles and zeros of G(s)H(s) to the point s1.
The  following  properties  of  the  root  loci  are  useful  for  sketching  the  root  loci  based  on  the  pole-zero
conÔ¨Åguration of G(s)H(s). Many computer programs, such as the ROOTLOCI in the ACSP software package
[Kuo,  1991b],  are  available  for  computing  and  plotting  the  root  loci.  The  proofs  and  derivations  of  these
properties can be carried out from Eqs. (100.39), (100.40), and (100.41) [Kuo, 1991a].
