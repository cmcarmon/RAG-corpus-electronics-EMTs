for part numbers, where xx or xxx specifies a 
particular type of logic device. For instance, the 
7400 is a quad 2‐input NAND gate. The Low‐
Power Schottky version of this part is coded 
74LS00.
CMOS, which stands for complementary metal‐
oxide semiconductor, is one type of technology 
used to make MOSFETs (metal‐oxide semicon-
ductor  field‐effect  transistors).  (You  can  see 
why this family shortened its name to CMOS!) 
CMOS chips are a little more expensive than 
their TTL equivalents, but they draw a lot less 
power and operate over a wider range of supply 
voltages  (3  to  15  volts).  They  require  special 
handling  because  they  are  very  sensitive  to 
static electricity. Some CMOS chips are pin‐
for‐pin equivalents of TTL chips, and are iden-
tified by a C in the middle of the part number. 
For instance, the 74C00 is a CMOS quad 2‐input 
NAND gate with the same pinout as its cousin, 
the TTL 7400 IC. Chips in the 40xx series, for 
instance, the 4017 decade counter and 4511 7‐
segment display driver, are also members of the 
CMOS family.
