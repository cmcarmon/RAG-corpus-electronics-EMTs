Moreover, once the multiplier l is speciﬁed, the power
generations Pi can be uniquely determined from equation 8.8
since this equation is linear in Pi. Therefore, it follows that the
optimal solution of the equations 8.8 and 8.9 essentially re-
duces to the problem of ﬁnding the Lagrangian multiplier l.
There exist excellent iterative techniques in the literature for
ﬁnding the optimal solution by iterating on l.
