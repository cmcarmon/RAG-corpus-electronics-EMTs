The other electrode (called the reference electrode) is made from a chemical solution of
neutral (7) pH buffer solution (usually potassium chloride) allowed to exchange ions with the
process solution through a porous separator, forming a relatively low resistance connection to
the test liquid. At ﬁrst, one might be inclined to ask: why not just dip a metal wire into the
solution to get an electrical connection to the liquid? The reason this will not work is because
metals tend to be highly reactive in ionic solutions and can produce a signiﬁcant voltage across
the interface of metal-to-liquid contact. The use of a wet chemical interface with the mea-
sured solution is necessary to avoid creating such a voltage, which of course would be falsely
interpreted by any measuring device as being indicative of pH.
