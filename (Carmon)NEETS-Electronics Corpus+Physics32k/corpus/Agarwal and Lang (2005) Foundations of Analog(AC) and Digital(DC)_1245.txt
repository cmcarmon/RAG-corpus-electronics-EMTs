Equation 9.16 is a statement of incremental energy storage within the capacitor.
It states that the transport of the incremental charge dq from the negative plate
of the capacitor to the top plate across the electric potential difference v stores
the incremental energy dwE within the capacitor. To obtain the total stored
electric energy, we must integrate Equation 9.16 with v treated as a function
of q. This yields
