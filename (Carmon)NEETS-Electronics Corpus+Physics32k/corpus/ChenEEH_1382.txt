Run-time reconﬁguration has two main beneﬁts. First, it
enables multiplexing nonmutually dependent operations in
the time domain: circuit area can be reduced by including
only the active parts of a circuit at a particular moment in
time. If the tasks or the algorithmic steps in an application can
be partitioned into smaller ones to ﬁt into available FPGA
resources, run-time reconﬁguration can be used to swap be-
tween the smaller circuits. This technique will enable the
implementation of a large virtual circuit in a small physical
FPGA.
