Prior to the ratification of the 1975 Family Protection Law, a man could marry four wives and have a large number of temporary marriages. As a result of this law (1975), a man could marry a second wife only by permission of the courts (with a valid reason to obtain this permission) and after obtaining the express consent of his first wife. Concurrently, the wife was given the right to obtain a divorce from her husband in case he took a second wife.
