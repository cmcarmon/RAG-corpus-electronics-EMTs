In meteorology, training denotes repeated areas of rain, typically associated with thunderstorms, that move over the same region in a relatively short period of time. Training thunderstorms are capable of producing excessive rainfall totals, often causing flash flooding. The name training is derived from how a train and its cars travel along a track (moving along a single path), without the track moving.
