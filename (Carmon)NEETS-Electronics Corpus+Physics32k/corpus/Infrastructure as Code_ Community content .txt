An important aspect when considering CCA tools, if they are open source, is the community content. As Gartner states the value of CCA tools is “as dependent on user community-contributed content and support as it is on the commercial maturity and performance of the automation tooling.” Vendors like Puppet and Chef, those that have been around a significant amount of time, have created their own communities; Chef has Chef Community Repository and Puppet has PuppetForge, other vendors rely on adjacent communities and leverage other IaC frameworks such as PowerShell DSC. New vendors are emerging that are not content driven, but model driven with the intelligence in the product to deliver content. These visual, object oriented systems work well for developers, but are especially useful to production oriented DevOps and Ops constituents that value models versus scripting for content. As the field continues to develop and change, the community based content will become ever important to how IaC tools are utilized, unless they are model driven and object oriented.
