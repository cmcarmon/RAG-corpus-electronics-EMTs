In ssb the carrier is suppressed (or eliminated) at the transmitter, and the sideband frequencies
produced by the carrier are reduced to a minimum. You will probably find this reduction (or elimination)
is the most difficult aspect in the understanding of ssb. In a single-sideband suppressed carrier, no carrier
is present in the transmitted signal. It is eliminated after modulation is accomplished and is reinserted at
