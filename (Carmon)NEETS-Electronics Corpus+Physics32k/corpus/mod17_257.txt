The base of Q1 is connected to the automatic volume control (avc) line. Anytime a signal enters the
receiver, a negative avc voltage is applied to the base of Q1. This reduces the collector current and
increases the collector voltage, which in turn increases the anode voltage of CR1 until the anode becomes
positive with respect to the cathode. Once again diode CR1 will conduct, and the signal will be passed to
the second af amplifier. Diode CR1 is effectively a switch controlled by the avc voltage.
