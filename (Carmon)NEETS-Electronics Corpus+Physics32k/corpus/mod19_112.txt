Third degree burns are worst of all. The skin is destroyed, and possibly also the tissue and muscle 
beneath it. The skin may be charred, or it may be white and lifeless (from scalds). After the initial injury, 
pain may be less severe because of destroyed nerve ends. The person may have chills. Some form of 
shock will result.
