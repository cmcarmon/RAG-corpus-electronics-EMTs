No matter where you set up shop, consider the climate. Extremes in heat, 
cold, or humidity can have a profound effect on your electronics circuits. If 
you find a work area chilly, warm, or damp, take steps to control the climate 
in that area, or don’t use that area for electronics work. You may need to add 
insulation, an air conditioner, or a dehumidifier to control the temperature 
and humidity of your work area. Locate your workbench away from open 
doors and windows that can allow moisture and extreme temperatures in. 
And for safety reasons, never — repeat, never — work in an area where the 
floor is wet or even slightly damp.
