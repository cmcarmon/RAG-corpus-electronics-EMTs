magnetization M. The elements chromium and manga-
nese are examples of antiferromagnetic materials. This
effect is highly temperature dependent. Below the NeÂ´el
temperature TN , the magnetic susceptibility increases
with increasing temperature but decreases for tempera-
ture greater than TN (Kittel, 1996).
