Lysaght and Dunlop (1994) have proposed a self-controlled
management technique called logic caching that is based on
the same principles used by traditional microprocessors. They
suggest many improvements to traditional FPGA compilation
software to support the development of run-time reconﬁgur-
able designs. These include simulation models, automatic
design partitioning based on temporal speciﬁcations, and sup-
port for generating relocatable bit streams. Others have also
reported work on temporal partitioning and scheduling of
conﬁguration data (Purna and Bhatia, 1999), block-processing
based temporal partitioning (Kaul and Vemuri, 2000), identi-
fying and positioning of reconﬁgurable regions (Shirazi et al.,
1998a), and generating relocatable bit streams (Shirazi et al.,
1998b).
