Multimode step-index fibers may also have a plastic core and cladding. All-plastic fibers have a
higher NA, a larger core size, and cost less to manufacture. However, all-plastic fibers exhibit high loss in
the thousands of decibels per kilometer. This high loss is caused by impurities and intrinsic absorption.
PCS and all-plastic fibers are used in applications typically characterized by one or all of the following:
