The fundamental basis for induced voltage in a magnetic field comes from Faraday's law describing an induced electromotive force (EMF) as follows: Emf = -N (∆Φb / ∆t) (Nave, C. R. 2011). This implies that as the number of magnetic flux lines increase or decrease there is a subsequent induced voltage of negative or positive polarity. However the relationship of electric forces and magnetic forces were summed up in Lorentz Force Law as F as follows: F = qE + qv x B Here all three forces were found to be perpendicular to each other (Nave, a, 2011). Thus Lorentz gave specially oriented direction to each of the forces allowing us to predict the direction of forces within the inductive pump architecture. Salamey further investigated the relationship of magnetic flux to circumferential area about the magnetic field where most of the magnetic forces were found to create mechanical forces used to direct the motion of the piston. Salamey further describes in his second patent the incorporation of a magnetic field gap. The gap is defined as a region of non-magnetic conduction circumferentially located at either end of the piston bore. The magnetic gap allows for increased propagation of magnetic flux through the magnetic piston body causing an increased force pulling the piston towards the magnetic end-pole (Salamey, 1999).
