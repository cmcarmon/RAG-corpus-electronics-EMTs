geometry; e.g., if a Ô¨Åt it made to a wide-long device and a wide-short device, and then one observes how the
models  track  for  lengths  between  these  two  extremes,  they  usually  do  not  perform  well.  For  narrow  devices
they can be quite poor as well. Level 3 has very little practical advantage over level 2, although the level 2 model
is proclaimed to be more physically based, whereas the level 3 model is called semiempirical. If only one can
be  used,  perhaps  level  3  is  slightly  better  because  it  runs  somewhat  faster  and  does  not  have  quite  such  an
annoying kink in the transition region from linear to saturation as does level 2.
