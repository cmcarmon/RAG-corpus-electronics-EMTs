Generally speaking, sliding-mode control (SMC) is a robust
nonlinear control algorithm that employs discontinuous con-
trol to force system state trajectories to lie on some prescribed
sliding surface (Utkin, 1992; DeCarlo et al., 2000, 1996, 1988).
Used widely for its robustness to model parameter uncertain-
ties and external disturbances, SMC methodology has had
great success in a wide variety of practical applications due to
its ease of implementation and its favorable robustness prop-
erties. It can be argued, in fact, that this tendency toward
successful application (a tendency enjoyed by only a few non-
linear design methodologies) has given rise to several new areas
of active research in the general Ô¨Åeld of SMC. For example,
until recent years, the bulk of research in SMC has been on
