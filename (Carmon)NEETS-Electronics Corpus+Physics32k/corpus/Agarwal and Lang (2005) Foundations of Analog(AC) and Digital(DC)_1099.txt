Many circuit applications, such as audio amplifiers, demand a linear amplifier
of the form depicted in Figure 8.3. The amplifier shown in the figure has a
constant gain A that is independent of the input voltage. Does that mean we
cannot use the MOSFET amplifier in these linear applications? It turns out
that total variables representing signals such as those input to an audio ampli-
fier commonly consist of two components: a DC offset (or an average value),
plus a time-varying component with a zero average. We will show that if the
time-varying component is small, then the incremental amplification provided
by the MOSFET amplifier to the time-varying component about the operating
point defined by the input DC offset will be approximately linear. As we saw in
Section 4.5, this observation actually generalizes to arbitrary nonlinear circuits:
The response of a circuit to small perturbations about an operating point will
be linear. Thus, if the signals of interest to us can be represented as small per-
turbations about an operating point, then the response of arbitrary nonlinear
