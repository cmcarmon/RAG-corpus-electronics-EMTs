An improved high-frequency bipolar transistor can be fabricated using heterostructures of compound semi-
conductors, such as AlGaAs/GaAs [Kroemer, 1982]. These devices have their emitters fabricated from a wide-
bandgap semiconductor (such as AlGaAs) and the remainder of the device fabricated from the lower-bandgap
semiconductor  (GaAs).  The  wide-bandgap  emitter  results  in  improved  charge  injection  efÔ¨Åciency  across  the
base-emitter junction into the base region and much improved RF performance. While the operation of standard
