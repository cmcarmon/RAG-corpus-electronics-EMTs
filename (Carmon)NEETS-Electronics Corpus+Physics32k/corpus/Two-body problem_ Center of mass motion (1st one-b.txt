R



{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} }
is the position of the center of mass (barycenter) of the system.
The resulting equation:








R

¨



=
0


{\displaystyle {\ddot {\mathbf {R} }}=0}

shows that the velocity V = dR/dt of the center of mass is constant, from which follows that the total momentum m1 v1 + m2 v2 is also constant (conservation of momentum). Hence, the position R (t) of the center of mass can be determined at all times from the initial positions and velocities.
