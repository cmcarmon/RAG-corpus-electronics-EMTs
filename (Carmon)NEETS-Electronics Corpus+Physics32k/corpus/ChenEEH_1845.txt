IpSec (Chapman and Chapman, 2000; Opplinger, 1998) pro-
vides a suite of protocols that can be used to carry out secure
transactions. IpSec adds security protection to IP packets. This
approach allows applications to communicate securely without
having to be modiﬁed. For example, before IpSec came into
picture, applications often used SSH or SSL for having a secure
peer-to-peer communication, but this required modifying cer-
tain APIs in the application source code and subsequent
recompilation. IpSec cleanly separates policy from enforce-
ment. The policy (which trafﬁc ﬂow is secured and how it is
secured) is provided by the system administrator, while the
enforcement of this policy is carried out by a set of protocols:
Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulated Security Pay-
load (ESP). These policies are placed as rules in a Secure Policy
Database (SPD), consulted for every inbound/outbound
packet, and tell IpSec how to deal with a particular packet: if
a IpSec mechanism needs to be applied to the packet, if the
packet should be dropped, or if the packet should be for-
warded without placing any security mechanism. If the admin-
