BLOCKED-GRID KEYING.â€”Two methods of BLOCKED-GRID KEYING are shown in figure 
1-24. The key in view (A) shorts cathode resistor R1 allowing normal plate current to flow. With the key 
open, reduced plate current flows up through resistor R1 making the end connected to grid resistor Rg 
negative. If R1 has a high enough value, the bias developed is sufficient to cause cutoff of plate current. 
Depressing the key short-circuits R1. This increases the bias above cutoff and allows the normal flow of 
plate current. Grid resistor Rg is the usual grid-leak resistor for normal biasing.
