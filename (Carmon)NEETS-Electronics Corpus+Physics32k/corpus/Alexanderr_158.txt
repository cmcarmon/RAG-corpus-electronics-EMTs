There are two types of BJTs: npn and pnp, with their circuit sym-
bols  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.38.  Each  type  has  three  terminals,  designated
as  emitter  (E),  base  (B),  and  collector  (C).  For  the  npn transistor,  the
currents  and  voltages  of  the  transistor  are  speciÔ¨Åed  as  in  Fig.  3.39.
Applying KCL to Fig. 3.39(a) gives
