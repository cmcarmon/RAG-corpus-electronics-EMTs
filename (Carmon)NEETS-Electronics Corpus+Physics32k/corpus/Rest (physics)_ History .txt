Given an inertial frame of reference, Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, while the motion of a moving object will remain unchanged until acted upon by an external force. An object at rest, therefore, can be described as without velocity and accelerationâ€”although, according to relativity, an object is either at rest or in motion relative to other moving objects. The concept of "relative rest" is closely linked to that of inertial observers and the statement that "nothing is at absolute rest" is loosely equivalent to stating that there are no frames of reference which are truly inertial. So-called non-inertial observers are addressed by the theory of general relativity.
