Generally, it is useful to have multiple ranges established for an electromechanical meter
such as this, allowing it to read a broad range of voltages with a single movement mechanism.
This is accomplished through the use of a multi-pole switch and several multiplier resistors,
each one sized for a particular voltage range:
