In 1875, Hamilton joined Western Union as
assistant electrician and, for the next two years,
worked with Gerritt Smith in establishing and
maintaining the ﬁrst quadruplex telegraph cir-
cuits  in  both  America  and  England.  He  then
focused on the development of the Wheatstone
high-speed automatic system and was also the
chief electrician on the Key West–Havana cable
repair expedition. Hamilton left Western Union
in  1889,  however,  to  join  Western  Electric,
where he was placed in charge of the production
of  ﬁne  electrical  instruments  until  the  time  of
his retirement. (Courtesy of the IEEE Center for
