Algorithms and Further Research Topics
There are robust identiﬁcation algorithms that consider frequency domain experiments, called H∞–identiﬁca-
tion, this being the norm that measures the identiﬁcation error. The two main ones are the two-stage and the
interpolation algorithms. From time-domain measurements, several ᐉ
1-identiﬁcation procedures are available.
Due to the fact that robust identiﬁcation is a currently active research area, there are yet many theoretical
and  computational  aspects  that  have  not  been  fully  developed. Among  others,  there  are  problems  related  to
identifying unstable plants and nonuniformly spaced experimental samples. Also, sample complexity is a recent
research direction, as well as the mixture of time and frequency experiments and parametric and nonparametric
models.
