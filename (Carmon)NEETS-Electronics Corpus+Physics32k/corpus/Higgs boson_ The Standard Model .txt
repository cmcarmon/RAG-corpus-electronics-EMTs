Physicists explain the properties and forces between elementary particles in terms of the Standard Model â€“ a widely accepted framework for understanding almost everything in the known universe, other than gravity. (A separate theory, General Relativity, is used for gravity.) In this model, the fundamental forces in nature arise from properties of our universe called gauge invariance and symmetries. The forces are transmitted by particles known as gauge bosons.
