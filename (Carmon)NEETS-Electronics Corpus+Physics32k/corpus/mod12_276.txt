You should be able to see by studying figure 2-9, views (A) and (B), that the modulating frequency
determines the spacing of the sideband frequencies. By using a significant sidebands table (such as table
2-1), you can determine the bandwidth of a given fm signal. Figure 2-10 illustrates the use of this table.
The carrier frequency shown is 500 kilohertz. The modulating frequency is 15 kilohertz and the deviation
frequency is 75 kilohertz.
