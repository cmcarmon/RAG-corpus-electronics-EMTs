 Inductance is the characteristic of an electrical circuit that opposes the starting, stopping, or a change 
in value of current. The above statement is of such importance to the study of inductance that it bears 
repeating. Inductance is the characteristic of an electrical conductor that OPPOSES CHANGE in 
CURRENT. The symbol for inductance is L and the basic unit of inductance is the HENRY (H). One 
henry is equal to the inductance required to induce one volt in an inductor by a change of current of one 
ampere per second.
