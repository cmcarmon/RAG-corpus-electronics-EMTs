There are two basic types of magnetic recording tape in common use: analog and digital. Analog
magnetic tape is used to record, store, and reproduce audio and instrumentation type signals. These
signals are usually in a frequency band from very-low frequency (VLF) to 2.5 MHz. Digital magnetic
tape is used to record, store, and reproduce computer programs and data. Itâ€™s base material thickness is
about 50 percent thicker than analog magnetic tape. This allows the digital tape to withstand the more
strenuous starts and stops associated with digital magnetic recorder search, read, and write functions.
