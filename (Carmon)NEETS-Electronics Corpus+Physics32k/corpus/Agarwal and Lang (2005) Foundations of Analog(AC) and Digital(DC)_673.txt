Suppose we replace the source vI with a DC voltage VI
in series with a small
time-varying voltage vi = vo cos(ωt). Determine the time varying component of iA.
Suppose we now replace vI = VI + vi, where VI = 10 V and vi = 1 V.
i)
ii)
iii)
iv)
v) Now, find the exact value of the ia using ia = iA − IA.
vi) What is the error in the value of ia computed using the small signal method?
