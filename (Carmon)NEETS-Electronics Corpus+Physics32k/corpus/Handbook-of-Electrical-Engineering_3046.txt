From  Eq.  (29.8)  and  Eq.  (29.9),  and  referring  to  Fig.  29.7,  normalized  values  for  the  components  are
computed as follows. As the s term in the numerator is to be zero, set B = D = 0 (which obtains if resistors
R/B and R/D are simply removed from the circuit). Setting C = 1 F gives the following results:
