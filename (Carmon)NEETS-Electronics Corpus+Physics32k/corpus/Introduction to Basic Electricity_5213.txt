For an IC, remove as much solder as possible from 
the connection using 0.030-inch-diameter desoldering 
braid. The only solder remaining is holding the com-
ponent leads to the printed circuit board. Wipe the 
soldering iron clean and heat the lead and pad while 
using an X-Acto knife to gently pry up the lead. When 
the lead releases, remove the soldering iron and allow 
the lead to cool. Repeat on each lead until the IC is 
removed from the printed circuit board.
