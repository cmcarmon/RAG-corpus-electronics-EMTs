Two important facts are brought out in this chart. First, the power at the input to circuit number 2 is 
greatest when the impedances are equal (matched). The power is also equal at the output of circuit 
number 1 and the input of circuit number 2 when the impedance is matched. The second fact is that the 
largest voltage signal is developed at the input to circuit number 2 when its input impedance is much 
larger than the output impedance of circuit number 1. However, the power at the input of circuit number 2
