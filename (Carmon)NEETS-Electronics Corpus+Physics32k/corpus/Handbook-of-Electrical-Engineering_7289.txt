Another  digital  technology,  introduced  for  cellular  systems  in  the  early  1990s,  was  code  division  multiple
access (CDMA). This technology is based on the principles of spread spectrum, in which narrow-band user
trafﬁc is transformed into wideband signals resembling white noise over the resultant signal bandwidth. This
is  accomplished  by  modulating  user  trafﬁc  with  a  higher-rate  spreading  sequence,  normally  generated  by
maximum-length shift registers. This technology was used in military communications for its inherent security
and resistance to jamming. The IS-95 public wireless standard introduced CDMA, with each user occupying
a 1.25-MHz bandwidth. The ﬁrst commercial CDMA systems were launched in the United States in 1996. The
radio interface for IS-95 is summarized in Table 75.8.
