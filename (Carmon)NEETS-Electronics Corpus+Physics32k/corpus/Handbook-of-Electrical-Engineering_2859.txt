In the surface mount assembly process, Type II and Type III boards will always require adhesive to mount the
SMDs for passage through the solder wave. This is apparent when one envisions components on the bottom
side of the substrate with no through-hole leads to hold them in place. Adhesives will stay in place after the
soldering process, and throughout the life of the substrate and the product, since there is no convenient means
for adhesive removal once the solder process is complete. This means the adhesive used must meet a number
of both physical and chemical characteristics that should be considered during the three phases of adhesive use
in  SMT  production:  pre-application  properties  relating  to  storage  and  dispensing  issues,  curing  properties
relating to time and temperature needed for cure, and post-curing properties: relating to Ô¨Ånal strength, mechan-
ical stability, and reworkability. Among these characteristics are:
