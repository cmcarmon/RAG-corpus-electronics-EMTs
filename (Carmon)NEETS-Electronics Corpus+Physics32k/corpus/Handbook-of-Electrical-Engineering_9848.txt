Figure 100.13 illustrates the gain and phase versus frequency curves for a simple lag network with this transfer
function. The maximum phase lag obtainable from a phase-lag network depends upon the ratio w
1 that is
used in designing the network. From the expression for the phase shift of this transfer function,
