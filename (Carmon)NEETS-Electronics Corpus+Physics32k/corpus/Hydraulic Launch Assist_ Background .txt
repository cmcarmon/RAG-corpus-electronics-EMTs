The HLA system recycles energy by converting kinetic energy into potential energy during deceleration via hydraulics, storing the energy at high pressure in an accumulator filled with nitrogen gas. The energy is then returned to the vehicle during subsequent acceleration thereby reducing the amount of work done by the internal combustion engine. This system provides considerable increase in vehicle productivity while reducing fuel consumption in stop-and-go use profiles like refuse vehicles and other heavy duty vehicles.
