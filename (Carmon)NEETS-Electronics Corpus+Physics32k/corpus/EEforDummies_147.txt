Sometimes open circuits are created by accident. You forget to connect a 
battery, for instance, or there’s a break in a wire somewhere in your circuit. 
When you build a circuit using a solderless breadboard (which I discuss in 
Chapters 2 and 15), you may mistakenly plug one side of a component into 
the wrong hole in the breadboard, leaving that component unconnected and 
creating an open circuit. Accidental open circuits are usually harmless but 
can be the source of much frustration when you’re trying to figure out why 
your circuit isn’t working the way you think it should.
