waveforms. Tone A is a simple wave of a specific frequency that can be produced by a tuning fork, piano,
organ, or other musical instrument. Tone B is also a simple wave but at a different frequency. When the
two tones are sounded together, the complex waveform in tone C is produced. Note that tone C has the
same frequency as tone A with an increase in amplitude. The human ear could easily distinguish between
tone A and tone C because of the quality. Therefore, we can say that quality distinguishes tones of like
pitch and loudness when sounded on different types of musical instruments. It also distinguishes the
voices of different persons.
