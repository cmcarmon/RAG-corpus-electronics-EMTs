No-clean ﬂuxes are designed to not be cleaned, and this means they are of low activity (they don’t reduce
 be cleaned. No-clean ﬂuxes are designed
oxides as well as other types of ﬂux) and when used they should 
so  that  after  reﬂow  they  microscopically  encapsulate  themselves,  sealing  in  any  active  components.  If  the
substrate  is  subsequently  cleaned,  the  encapsulants  may  be  destroyed,  leaving  the  possibility  of  active  ﬂux
components remaining on the board.
