in Figure 13.4.9. Note that the no-load speed is very high; care must be taken to ensure that the
machine always operates on load. In practice, however, the series machine normally has a small
shunt-ﬁeld winding to limit the no-load speed. The assumption that the ﬂux is proportional to
the armature current is valid only on light load in the linear region of magnetization. In general,
performance characteristics of the series motor must be obtained by using the magnetization
curve. The series motor is ideally suited to traction, when large torques are required at low speeds
and relatively low torques are needed at high speeds.
