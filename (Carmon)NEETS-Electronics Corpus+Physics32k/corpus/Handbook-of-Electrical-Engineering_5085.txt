In order to keep the discussion simple, analytic complexities due to optical absorption of the magnetic medium
have been ignored. Such absorption can give rise to magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magnetic linear
dichroism (MLD). Interested readers can refer to Hellwege [1978] and Arecchi and Schulz-DuBois [1972] for
more in-depth discussions on MCD and MLD.
