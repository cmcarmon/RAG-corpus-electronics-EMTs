To compute the small-signal output resistance looking in from one of the terminals of
the output port, we turn off all independent sources by setting va = 0 and vb = 0,
in effect, turning off vc and vd. We introduce a test voltage at the desired output and
short the other output to ground. Therefore, the overall circuit is transformed to the
one shown in Figure 8.37. Thus the output resistance looking into ports vx or vy and
ground will be RL.
