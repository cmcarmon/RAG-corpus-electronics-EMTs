A shorted capacitor, an open filter choke, or a choke winding which is shorted to the core, results in 
a no-output indication. A shorted capacitor, depending on the magnitude of the short, may cause a shorted 
rectifier, transformer, or filter choke, and may result in a blown fuse in the primary of the transformer. An 
open filter choke results in an abnormally high dc voltage at the input to the filter and no voltage at the 
output of the filter. A leaky or open capacitor in the filter circuit results in a low dc output voltage. This 
condition is generally accompanied by an excessive ripple amplitude. Shorted turns in the winding of a 
filter choke reduce the effective inductance of the choke and decrease its filtering efficiency. As a result, 
the ripple amplitude increases.
