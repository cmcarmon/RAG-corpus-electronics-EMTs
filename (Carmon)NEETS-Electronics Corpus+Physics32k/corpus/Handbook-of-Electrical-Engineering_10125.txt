Typical  industrial  robots  have  six  or  fewer  DOF.  With  six  DOF,  the  robot  can,  within  its  work  envelope,
reach arbitrary positions and orientations. At the edge of the work envelope, a six-DOF robot can attain only
one  orientation.  To  increase  the  geometric  dexterity  of  the  manipulator,  it  is  useful  to  consider  robots  with
more than six DOF, i.e., redundant robots. These robots are highly dexterous and can use the extra DOF in
 (points where the manipulator
many ways: avoidance obstacle, joint torque minimization, kinematic 
cannot  move  in  certain  directions)  avoidance,  bracing  strategies  where  part  of  the  arm  is  braced  against  a
redundant manip-
structure, which raises the lowest structural resonant frequency of the arm, etc. While the 
ulator
 conÔ¨Åguration has many desirable properties, the geometric complexity has limited their application in
industry.
