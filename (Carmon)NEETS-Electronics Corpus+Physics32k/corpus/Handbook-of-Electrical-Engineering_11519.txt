The Clinical Environment
Hospitals are, indeed, complex organizations. They perform a vital function (patient care) but are subject to
strict regulation and operate under severe ﬁnancial constraints. Quality of patient care is the highest value, but
a competitive marketplace demands efﬁcient operation. Hospital information systems range from nonexistent
to antique to state-of-the-art.
