The z is the rotational parameter of the wave, indicating in
which manner the polarization ellipse rotates with time. In
Figure 6.3, z ¼ þ1 when the polarization ellipse of the par-
ticular wave turns clockwise (CW), and z ¼ -1 when the
polarization ellipse turns counterclockwise (CCW). The CW
and CCW waves are also referred to, respectively, as left-hand
polarized (LHP) and right-hand polarized (RHP) when the
wave propagates in the ^rr ¼ ^uu0  ^ff direction (which is the case
here). A more standardized convention may be followed to
describe the rotation of the polarization vector, which is inde-
pendent of the coordinate system one chooses to use. A wave is
called an RHP wave when the direction of wave propagation
