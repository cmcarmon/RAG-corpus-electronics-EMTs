The distance the electrons travel in the space separating the grid and the repeller depends upon their 
velocity. Those moving at slower velocities, such as the electron at time 4, move only a short distance 
from the grid before being affected by the repeller voltage. When this happens, the electron is forced by 
the repeller voltage to stop, reverse direction, and return toward the grid. The electrons moving at higher 
velocities travel further beyond the grid before reversing direction because they have greater momentum. 
If the repeller voltage is set at the correct value, the electrons will form a bunch around the constant-speed 
electrons. The electrons will then return to the grid gap at the instant the electrostatic field is at the correct 
polarity to cause maximum deceleration of the bunch. This action is also illustrated in figure 2-10, view 
(A). When the grid field provides maximum deceleration, the returning electrons release maximum 
energy to the grid field which is in phase with cavity current. Thus, the returning electrons supply the 
regenerative feedback required to maintain cavity oscillations.
