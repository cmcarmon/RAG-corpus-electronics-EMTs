A CLEAR pulse resets all the FFs at CP1. At CP2, the most significant bit of the data is input to
AND gate 1. This HIGH along with the clock pulse causes AND gate 1 to output a HIGH. The HIGH
from the AND gate and the clock pulse applied to FF1 cause the FF to set. FFs 2, 3, and 4 are held reset.
At this point, the MSD of the data has been shifted into the register.
