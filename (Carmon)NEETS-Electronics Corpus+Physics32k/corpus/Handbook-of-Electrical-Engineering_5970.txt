Fundamental to the operation of stepping motors is the utilization of power electronic switches, and of a
circuit  providing  the  timing  and  duration  of  the  pulses.  A  characteristic  of  a  speciÔ¨Åc  stepping  motor  is  the
maximum frequency it can operate at starting or running without load.
