The two most common types of mode filters are free-form loops and mandrel wraps. Figure 5-4
illustrates the free-form loop and mandrel-wrap types of mode filters. Mandrel wraps for multimode
fibers consist of several wraps (approximately 4 or 5) around a mandrel. A 20-mm diameter mandrel is
typically used for 62.5 m m fiber. Mandrel wraps for single mode fibers consist of a single wrap around a
30-mm diameter mandrel. Another common mode filter for single mode fibers is a 30-mm diameter
circular free-form loop. Additional information on multimode and single mode filters (and launch
conditions) is available in EIA/TIA-455-50 and EIA/TIA-455-77, respectively.
