Storage time (the time it takes for the transistor to come out of saturation) is a major factor of propagation
delay for saturated BJT transistors. A long storage time limits the switching speed of a standard TTL circuit.
The  propagation  delay  can  be  decreased  and,  therefore,  the  switching  speed  can  be  increased,  by  placing  a
Schottky diode between the base and collector of each transistor that might saturate. The resulting Schottky-
clamped  transistors  do  not  go  into  saturation  (effectively  eliminating  storage  time)  since  the  diode  shunts
current from the base into the collector before the transistor can achieve saturation. Today, digital circuit designs
implemented with TTL logic almost exclusively use one of the Schottky subfamilies to take advantage of the
signiÔ¨Åcant improvement in switching speed.
