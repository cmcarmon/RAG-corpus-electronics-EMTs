Once again, a complete discussion of all of the potential problems that can affect solder joint formation is
beyond the scope of this chapter. Many references are available which address the issues. An excellent overview
of solder joint formation theory is found in Lau [1991]. Update information this and all SMT topics is available
each year at conferences such as SMI and NEPCON.
