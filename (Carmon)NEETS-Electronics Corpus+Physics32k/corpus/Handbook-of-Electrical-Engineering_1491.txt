Large Vocabulary
In the 1990s, the term “large vocabulary” has come to mean 30K words or more. Although the vocabulary size
is certainly not the best measure of a task’s difﬁculty, it does affect the severity of many problems such as the
acoustic confusability of words, the degradation in performance due to using sub-word unit models, and the
computational complexity of the hypothesis search.
