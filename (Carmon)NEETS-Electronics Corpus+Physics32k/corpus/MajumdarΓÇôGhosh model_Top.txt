The Majumdar–Ghosh model is an extension of the one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg spin model in which an extra interaction is added coupling spins two lattice spacings apart such that the second-neighbor coupling is half as strong as the first. It is therefore a special case of the J1 J2 model. The model is named after Indian physicists Chanchal Kumar Majumdar and Dipan Ghosh.
The Majumdar–Ghosh model is notable because its ground states (lowest energy quantum states) can be found exactly and written in a simple form, making it a useful starting point for understanding more complex spin models and phases.
