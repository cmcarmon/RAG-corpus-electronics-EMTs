To see this, observe that the voltage source in Figure 2.31 applies the volt-
age V to two series resistors R1 and R2, and that from Equation 2.43 these
resistors respond with the common current i1 = i2 through their branches.
Further, observe from Equation 2.45 that this common current, i = i1 = i2,
