An effective intercept power, Pu
int , is deﬁned as associated with
a scatterer. The Pu
int is the equivalent power intercepted by the
scattering antenna that when reradiated by an isotropic an-
tenna provides the same power density at the observation
location as the scattering wave. The Pu
int is a function of the
angle of observation (u, f). The corresponding radar cross
section, su, is deﬁned as the ratio of the intercept power and
the incident power density Pu
