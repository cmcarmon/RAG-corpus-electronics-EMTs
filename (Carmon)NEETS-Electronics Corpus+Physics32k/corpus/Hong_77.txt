The highly non-linear current-voltage relationship of diodes also make them ideal 
for making voltage references. As shown in Figure 6.8, silicon diodes biased in the on-
state  can  be  used  to  generate  a  0.7V  reference.  For  references  from  1.8V  and  above, 
Zener diodes biased in the reverse direction can be used in a similar circuit. The output 
current  sourcing  capacity  is  limited  by  the  bias  current  through  the  diode.  In  order  to 
maintain the correct bias in the diode, the bias current through diode should be at least a 
few mA greater than the maximum current that the reference will be required to source. 
The resistor value can be selected using the same procedure for the LED circuit.
