mentation. A rate-optimal schedule cannot be guaranteed,
however, and cannot reduce the iteration period in perfect-
rate DFG (Parhi et al., 1989). Very similar to the retiming,
delay distribution methodology is presented for the FIR and
IIR digital Ô¨Ålter (Chen and Moricz, 1991). The optimization is
performed on an DFG/SFG, which represents a 1-D algorithm
and then is generalized to n-D one. The strategies consist of
balancing, rescaling, distribution, factorization, and inversion.
