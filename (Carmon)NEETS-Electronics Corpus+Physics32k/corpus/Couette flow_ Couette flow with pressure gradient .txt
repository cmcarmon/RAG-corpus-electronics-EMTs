The pressure gradient can be positive (adverse pressure gradient) or negative (favorable pressure gradient). It may be noted that in the limiting case of stationary plates(

), the flow is referred to as Plane Poiseuille flow with a symmetric (with reference to the horizontal mid-plane) parabolic velocity profile.
