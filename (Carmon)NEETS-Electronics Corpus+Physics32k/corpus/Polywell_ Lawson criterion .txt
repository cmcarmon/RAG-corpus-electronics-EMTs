{\displaystyle \langle \sigma v_{A,B}\rangle }
is the product of the collision cross-section σ (which depends on the relative velocity) and the relative velocity of the two species v, averaged over all the particle velocities in the system.
Energy varies with temperature, density, collision speed and fuel. To reach net power production, reactions must occur rapidly enough to make up for energy losses. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and escape. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy escapes as light. Radiation increases with temperature. To get net power from fusion, these losses must be overcome. This leads to an equation for power output.
Net Power = Efficiency × (Fusion − Radiation Loss − Conduction Loss)
Net Power — power output
Efficiency — fraction of energy needed to drive the device and convert it to electricity.
Fusion — energy generated by the fusion reactions.
Radiation — energy lost as light, leaving the plasma.
Conduction — energy lost, as mass leaves the plasma.
Lawson used this equation to estimate conditions for net power based on a Maxwellian cloud.
However, the Lawson criterion does not apply for Polywells if Bussard's conjecture that the plasma is nonthermal is correct. Lawson stated in his founding report: "It is of course easy to postulate systems in which the velocity distribution of the particle is not Maxwellian. These systems are outside the scope of this report." He also ruled out the possibility of a nonthermal plasma to ignite: "Nothing may be gained by using a system in which electrons are at a lower temperature [than ions]. The energy loss in such a system by transfer to the electrons will always be greater than the energy which would be radiated by the electrons if they were the [same] temperature."
