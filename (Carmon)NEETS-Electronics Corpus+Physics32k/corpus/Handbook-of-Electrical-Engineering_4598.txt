Ever since the discovery of superconductivity in 1911, researchers have sought to raise the temperature at which
superconductivity  occurs.  With  the  advent  of  high  temperature  superconducting  (HTS)  materials  in  1986,
superconductors have begun to emerge from the laboratory and appear in practical applications. A pioneer in
this  explosively  advancing  technology  is  Superconducting  Technologies,  Inc.,  Santa  Barbara,  California.  This
company  uses  thallium,  the  highest  temperature  material  for  making  high  temperature  superconductors.

nitrogen  system  instead  of  the  more  difÔ¨Åcult  and  more  expensive  helium  method.  Shown  above  is  a  high
temperature superconductor being produced by a laser ablation system. (Photo courtesy of National Aeronautics
