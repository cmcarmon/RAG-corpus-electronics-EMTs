The RAM method uses a small RAM and a pointer to the
last stored value of the register to create a circular buffer.
Like the previous solution, a R/W operation is performed on
the current register (see Figure 8.18). During a write operation,
the old value of the current register is written into the RAM
location that immediately follows the pointer, and the pointer
is then updated to point to this location. For microrollback, it
is simply necessary to subtract the desired rollback distance
from the pointer and move the value in the entry following the
newly pointed location to the current register.
