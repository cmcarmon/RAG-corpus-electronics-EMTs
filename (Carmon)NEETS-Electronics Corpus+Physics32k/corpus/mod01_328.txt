A secondary cell is one in which the electrodes and the electrolyte are altered by the chemical action 
that takes place when the cell delivers current. These cells may be restored to their original condition by 
forcing an electric current through them in the direction opposite to that of discharge. The automobile 
storage battery is a common example of the secondary cell.
