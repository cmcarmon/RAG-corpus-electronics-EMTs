Reliable communication to and from a satellite requires a knowledge of its position and velocity relative to a
location on the earth. Details of the relevant astrodynamic formulas for satellite orbits are given in GrifÔ¨Ån and
French  [1991],  Morgan  and  Gordon  [1989],  and  Chobotov  [1991].  Launch  vehicles  needed  to  deliver  the
satellites to their intended orbits are described in Isakowitz [1991].
