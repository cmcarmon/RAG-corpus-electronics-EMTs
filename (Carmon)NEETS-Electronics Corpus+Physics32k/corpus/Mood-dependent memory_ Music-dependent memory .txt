Music-dependent memory is an effect of mood-dependent memory. There have been many studies conducted that have proven that the music one listens to may affect their mood. In Balch and Lewis’ article, they studied how the subjects’ mood was affected by the change in tempo of the same musical piece. The subjects were each given a list of words to read while music playing in the background, with varying tempos distributed randomly. The participants were then asked to recall all the words they had read previously. Balch and Lewis found that the subjects were able to remember more words when the tempo did not change. This same experiment was composed in different ways: with a change in timbre, a different song playing, or silence with no music at all. However, none of these experiments returned results that the different aspects of the music affected the memory of the participants. Change in tempo seemed to be the only thing that influenced the participants’ memories, as opposed to other dimensions of musicality. There is still much research being done concerning music-dependent memory.
