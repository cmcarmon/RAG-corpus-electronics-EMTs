In the October 2009 issue of the American Journal of Physics Greaves, Rodriguez and Ruiz-Camacho reported a new method of measurement of the one-way speed of light. In the June 2013 issue of the American Journal of Physics Hankins, Rackson and Kim repeated the Greaves et al. experiment obtaining with greater accuracy the one way speed of light. This experiment proves with greater accuracy that the signal return path to the measuring device has a constant delay, independent of the end point of the light flight path, allowing measurement of the time of flight in a single direction.
J. Finkelstein claimed that the Greaves et al. experiment actually measures the round trip (two-way) speed of light.
In the November issue of the Indian Journal of Physics, Ahmed et al. published a comprehensive review of One-Way and Two-Way Experiments to test the isotropy of the speed of light.
