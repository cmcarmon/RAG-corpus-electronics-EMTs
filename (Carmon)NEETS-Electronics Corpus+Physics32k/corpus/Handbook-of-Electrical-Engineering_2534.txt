The  conclusions  reached  above  regarding  the  performance  of  the  bipolar  transistor  are  sufﬁcient  for  the
development of a basic equivalent circuit, or model, relevant only to small-signal operation. Taking the operating
CE ampliﬁer, this may be done by ﬁrst “looking into” the base, shown as b in Fig. 24.31. Between this point
and  the  actual  active  part  of  the  base  region  b¢,  it  is  reasonable  to  suppose  that  the  intervening  (inactive)
semiconductor material will present a small resistance rbb¢ . This is called the base spreading resistance, and it is
also shown in Fig. 24.31.
