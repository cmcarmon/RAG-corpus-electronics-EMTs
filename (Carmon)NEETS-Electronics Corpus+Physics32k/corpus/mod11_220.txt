The conventional amplifier is essentially a variable resistance that uses energy from a dc source to 
increase ac energy. The parametric amplifier uses a nonlinear variable reactance to supply energy from an 
ac source to a load. Since reactance does not add thermal noise to a circuit, parametric amplifiers produce 
much less noise than most conventional amplifiers.
