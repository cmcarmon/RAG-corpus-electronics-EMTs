Magnetoresistive heads are typically more sensitive than inductive heads and therefore produce larger signal
amplitudes  during  readback.  The  increased  sensitivity  and  the  fact  that  the  read  head  is  independent  of  the
write head can be used to make a write/read head combination in which the write head writes a wider track
than the read head senses. Thus, adjacent track interference is reduced during the readback process.
