Summary
In this section, we developed two-port parameter models for two-port electrical networks. The models deﬁne
interrelationships among the input and output voltages and currents. A total of six models exists, depending
upon which two variables are selected as independent variables. Any model can be used to ﬁnd such network
characteristics as input and output impedance, and voltage and current gains. Once one model is found, other
models can be obtained from transformation equations. The choice of parameter set is based upon physical
reality and analytical convenience.
