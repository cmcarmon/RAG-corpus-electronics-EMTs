Most implementations of arithmetic units for RNS consist of
an accumulator and a multiplier and are based on ROMs or
PLAs. Bayoumi et al. (1983) have analyzed the efﬁciency of
various VLSI implementations of RNS adders. Moreover, im-
plementations of arithmetic units that operate in a ﬁnite integer
ring R(m) and that are called AUms are offered in the literature
(Stouraitis, 1993). They are less costly and require less area and
lower hardware complexity and power consumption. They are
based on continuously decomposing the residue bits that cor-
respond to powers of 2 that are larger than or equal to 2n, until
they are reduced to a set of bits that correspond to a sum of
powers of 2 that is less than 2n, where n ¼ dlog2 me. This
