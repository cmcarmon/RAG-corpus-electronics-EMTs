In this case, assume an electrical load requires only 1.5 volts, but will require 1/2 ampere of current. 
(Assume that a single cell will supply only 1/8 ampere.) To meet this requirement, the cells are connected 
in parallel, as shown in figure 2-7 view A and schematically represented in 2-7 view B. In a parallel 
connection, all positive cell electrodes are connected to one line, and all negative electrodes are connected 
to the other. No more than one cell is connected between the lines at any one point; so the voltage 
between the lines is the same as that of one cell, or 1.5 volts. However, each cell may contribute its 
maximum allowable current of 1/8 ampere to the line. There are four cells, so the total line current is 
1/8 Ã— 4, or 1/2 ampere. In this case four cells in parallel have enough capacity to supply a load requiring 
1/2 ampere at 1.5 volts.
