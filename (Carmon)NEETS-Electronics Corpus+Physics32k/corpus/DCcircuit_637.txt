While this poses no electrical problem, it might cause confusion for anyone measuring resis-
tor voltage drops with a voltmeter, especially an analog voltmeter which will ”peg” downscale
when subjected to a voltage of the wrong polarity. For the sake of consistency, it might be wise
to arrange all wire connections so that all resistor voltage drop polarities are the same, like
this:
