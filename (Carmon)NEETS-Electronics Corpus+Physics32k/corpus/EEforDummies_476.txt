An inductor is a passive electronic component made from 
a coil of wire wrapped around a core — which could be 
air, iron, or ferrite (a brittle material made from iron). Iron‐
based core materials increase the strength of the magnetic 
field induced by current several hundred times. Inductors 
are sometimes known as coils, chokes, electromagnets, and 
solenoids, depending on how they’re used in circuits. The 
circuit symbol for an inductor is shown in Figure 8-5.
