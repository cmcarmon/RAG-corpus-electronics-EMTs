In this chapter, we have developed a direct adaptive control
method for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with a time-
varying structure using a Lyapunov approach to construct the
stability proofs. The systems we considered are composed of a
ﬁnite number of ‘‘pieces,’’ or dynamic subsystems, that are
interpolated by functions depending on a possibly exogenous
scheduling variable. We assumed that each piece is in strict
feedback form and showed that the methods yield stability of
all signals in the closed loop as well as show convergence of the
state vector to a residual set around the equilibrium, whose
size can be set by the choice of several design parameters
