The obvious drawback of direct moment-method models as Nx increases with increasing problem size and/or
complexity suggests the need for less computationally intensive alternatives. There are various alternatives for
decreasing the computer cost associated with solving electromagnetic problems using the method of moments.
The basic intent in any case is either to reduce the direct cost of performing a given modeling computation or
to reduce the number of modeling computations needed to obtain a desired result. An example for achieving
the latter is to employ lower-order models that can accurately enough represent the behavior of observables as
a function of space, angle, frequency, or time so that the sampling density of the ﬁrst-principles model can be
reduced. A speciﬁc example is used of the rational functions to approximate frequency-domain transfer func-
tions. These might include analytical, computational, and experimental approaches or combinations thereof,
about which further discussion and references may be found in Miller [1988].
