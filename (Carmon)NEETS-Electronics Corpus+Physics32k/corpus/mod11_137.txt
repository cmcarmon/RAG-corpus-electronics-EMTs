Amplification begins as the electron bunches form and release energy to the signal on the helix. The 
slightly amplified signal causes a denser electron bunch which, in turn, amplifies the signal even more. 
The amplification process is continuous as the rf wave and the electron beam travel down the length of 
the tube.
