The current rating of a switch refers to the maximum current the switch is designed to carry. This
rating is dependent on the voltage of the circuit in which the switch is used. This is shown in the example
given above. The current rating of a switch should never be exceeded. If the current rating of a switch is
exceeded, the contacts may "weld" together making it impossible to open the circuit.
