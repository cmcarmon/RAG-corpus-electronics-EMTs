A magnetic or electric probe can be used to observe the standing wave on a short-circuited,
terminated line. The wavelength is obtained by measuring the distance between alternate maximum or
minimum current points along the line. A typical setup operating at 300 megahertz might use two 10-foot
lengths of number 14 phosphor-bronze wires, which are spaced 1 inch apart and supported parallel to a set
of probe guide rails. The line should be partially matched to the source generator by means of a parallel-
wire shorting stub connected in parallel with the transmission line and the oscillator output line. Figure 4-
1, view A and view B, illustrates the types of probes required for this method of measurement.
