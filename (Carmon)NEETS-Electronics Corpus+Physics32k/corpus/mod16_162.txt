The operation of the bridge is explained in a few logical steps. When the battery switch S1 is closed,
electrons flow from the negative terminal of the battery to point a. Here the current divides as it would in
any parallel circuit. Part of it passes through R1 and R2; the remainder passes through R3 and Rx. The
two currents, I1 and I2, unite at point c and return to the positive terminal of the battery. The value of I1
depends on the sum of resistance R1 and R2, and the value of I2 depends on the sum of resistances R3 and
Rx. In each case, according to Ohmâ€™s law, the current is inversely proportional to the resistance.
