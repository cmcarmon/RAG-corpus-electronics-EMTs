Sources, also known as active elements, are electrical ele-
ments that provide power to a circuit. There are two types of
sources: (1) independent sources and (2) dependent (or con-
trolled) sources. An independent voltage source provides a
speciﬁed voltage irrespective of the elements connected to it.
In a similar manner, an independent current source provides a
speciﬁed current irrespective of the elements connected to it.
Figure 1.1 shows representations of independent voltage and
independent current sources. It may be noted that the value of
an independent voltage or an independent current source may
be constant in magnitude and direction (called a direct current
[dc] source) or may vary as a function of time (called a time-
varying source). If the variation is of sinusoidal nature, it is
called an alternating current (ac) source.
