where vt is the terminal voltage applied to the motor, ea is the back emf given by Equation (2), Ra
and La include the series resistance and inductance of the armature circuit and electrical source
put together, and Ï„a = La/Ra is the electrical time constant of the armature circuit. Note that the
operator p stands for (d/dt). The electromagnetic torque is given by Equation (1), and from the
dynamic equation for the mechanical system given by
