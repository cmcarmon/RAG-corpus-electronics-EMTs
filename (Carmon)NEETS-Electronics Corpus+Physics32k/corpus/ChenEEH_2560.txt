shorted ends of a piece of planar transmission line (i.e., micro-
strip, Figure 7.27). A combination of these may also be used as
a resonator. The electrical and magnetic energies stored in the
resonator determine its equivalent inductance and capacitance.
Any energy dissipation in the resonator due to ohmic, dielec-
tric, or radiation losses can be expressed by an equivalent
resistance or a conductance, which directly determines the
quality factor (Q-factor) of the resonator. The three electrical
parameters RLC constitute a complete equivalent circuit net-
work for characterizing a resonator in terms of bandwidth,
center frequency, and Q-factor.
