charged ions. The diffusion of electrons and holes across the junction will continue until the magnitude of
the electrostatic field is increased to the point where the electrons and holes no longer have enough
energy to overcome it, and are repelled by the negative and positive ions respectively. At this point
equilibrium is established and, for all practical purposes, the movement of carriers across the junction
ceases. For this reason, the electrostatic field created by the positive and negative ions in the depletion
region is called a barrier.
