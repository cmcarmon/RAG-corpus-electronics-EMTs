By far, the most widely used linear transform in compres-
sion schemes up to date is the discrete cosine transform
(DCT). It is part of the old JPEG standard (Pennebaker and
Mitchell, 1993) as well as most modern video compression
standards,
like H.261 (ITU-T, 1990), H.263 (ITU, 1996),
MPEG-1 (ISO/IEC, 1994), MPEG-2 (ISO/IEC, 1994) and
MPEG-4 (ISO/IEC, 1997). The DCT of a length N signal x(n)
consists of the coefÔ¨Åcients c(k) such that (Ahmed et al., 1974):
