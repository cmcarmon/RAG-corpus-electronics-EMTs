terminals of two or more elements are joined. Figure 1.2 shows
A, B, C, D, and E as nodes. A loop is a closed path in a circuit
such that each node is traversed only once when tracing the
loop. In Figure 1.2, ABCEA is a loop, and ABCDEA is also a
loop. A mesh is a special class of loop that is associated with a
window of a circuit drawn in a plane (planar circuit). In the
same Figure ABCEA is a mesh, whereas ABCDEA is not con-
sidered a mesh for the circuit as drawn. A network is deÔ¨Åned
as a circuit that has a set of terminals available for external
connections (i.e., accessible from outside of the circuit). A pair
of terminals of a network to which a source, another network,
or a measuring device can be connected is called a port of the
network. A network containing such a pair of terminals is
called a one-port network. A network containing two pairs
of externally accessible terminals is called a two-port network,
and multiple pairs of externally accessible terminal pairs are
called a multiport network.
