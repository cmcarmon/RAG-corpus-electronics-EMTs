Interchangeable cores require a notch at the tip of each key to properly align the peaks and valleys of each blade with the combinating pins in the chambers of the mechanism; as a consequence, these keys are always configured and cut from blade tip to bow. Conversely, conventional cylinders and removable cores use a shoulder near the bow of each key to properly align all peaks and valleys; as a consequence, these keys are always configured and cut from bow to blade tip. As a further consequence of this fundamental difference, neither of these two key types can ever be cross- or master-keyed with the other.
As a benefit to keying from blade tip to bow, a six- or seven-pin interchangeable core key blank can be machined to precisely fit a smaller five-pin system configuration. Although the blade of such keys may be a pin or two longer than need be, this extra length never enters the locking mechanism; therefore, five-, six- and seven-pin interchangeable core systems can be easily integrated to work with one another or to provide different levels of access control within the same system. Conventional cylinder and removable core systems are significantly more limited in this regard since the extra length of their keys must pass through to the inside of the locking mechanism, which is often just not physically possible.
For additional interchangeable core access control, non-proprietary keyways and key sections of the following designations are available: A, B, C, D, DD, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, Q, R, TB, TD and TE. Other less common but still non-proprietary keyways and key sections also exist, but these typically have differing designations from manufacturer to manufacturer, even though the components may otherwise be identical.
