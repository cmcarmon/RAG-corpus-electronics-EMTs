covalent bond, where electrons are shared between atoms. Because chemical bonds are based
on links formed by electrons, these bonds are only as strong as the immobility of the electrons
forming them. That is to say, chemical bonds can be created or broken by the same forces that
force electrons to move: heat, light, friction, etc.
