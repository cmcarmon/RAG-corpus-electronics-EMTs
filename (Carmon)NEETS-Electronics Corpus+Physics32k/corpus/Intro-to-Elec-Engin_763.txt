ﬁnd ωH , ωL, and the midband gain.
8.5.2 Consider a CS JFET ampliﬁer (Figure 8.5.2) with
R1 = 520 k, R2 = 140 , RD = 1 k, and
RSS = 1.4 k. The FET parameters are gm =
5 mS, ro = 20k, and Cgs = Cgd = 2 pF.
The source resistance RS is 500  and the load
resistance RL is 2 k. For the low-frequency 3-
dB angular frequency to be 40π rad/s, compute
CS, CD, CG, Av0 , and ωH .
8.5.3 Determine RL, Cgs, and Av0 of a CS JFET ampliﬁer
(Figure 8.5.2), given that RS = 1 k which can be
considered to be much less than (R1(cid:8)R2), RL =
RD, ωL << ωH , ω3dB = 25 × 106 rad/s, and
ωZ/ωH = 75. The transistor parameters are gm =
5 mS, ro >> (RD(cid:8)RL), and Cgs = Cgd.
