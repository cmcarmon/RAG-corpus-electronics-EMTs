Burn victims require large amounts of water, which should be slightly salted. Because of the nature 
of the injury, most burns are sterile. The best treatment for uninfected burns, therefore, is merely to 
protect the area by covering it with the cleanest (preferably sterile) dressing available. Never apply 
ointments to a burn nor use petrolatum gauze.
