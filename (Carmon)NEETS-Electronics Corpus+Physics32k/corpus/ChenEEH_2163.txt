The unit normal vector ^nn is determined using the right-hand
rule. That is, with the ﬁngers pointing in the direction of the
current, the thumb points in the direction of ^nn. The magnetic
dipole moment m of any planar loop can be computed using
equation 1.71. (Note, however, that the B ﬁeld from equation
1.37 produced by m is valid only at distances ‘‘far’’ from the
loop [White, 1998, Example 4.10].)
