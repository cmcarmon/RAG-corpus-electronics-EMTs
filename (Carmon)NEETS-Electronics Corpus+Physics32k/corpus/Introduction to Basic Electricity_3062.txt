The  alloyed  junction  method  of  forming  a 
 semiconductor is extremely simple. A small pellet 
of trivalent material, such as indium, is placed on an 
 N-type semiconductor crystal. The pellet and crystal 
are heated until the pellet melts and partially fuses 
with the semiconductor crystal. The area where the 
two materials combine forms the P-type material. 
When the heat is removed, the material recrystallizes 
and a solid Pâ€“N junction is formed.
