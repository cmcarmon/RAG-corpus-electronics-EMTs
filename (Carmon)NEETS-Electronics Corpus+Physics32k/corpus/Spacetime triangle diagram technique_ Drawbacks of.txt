The method can only be applied to problems possessing known Riemann function.
Application of the method and analysis of the results obtained require more profound knowledge of the special functions of mathematical physics (e.g., operating with the generalized functions, Mathieu functions of different kinds and Lommelâ€™s functions of two variables) than Green's function method.
In some cases the final integrals require special consideration in the domains of rapid oscillation of the Riemann function.
