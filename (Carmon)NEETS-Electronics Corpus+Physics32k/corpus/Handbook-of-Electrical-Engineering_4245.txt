Radar Waveforms
Pulse Compression
Typical pulse radar waveforms are summarized in Table 41.6. In most cases, the signal processor is designed
to closely approximate a matched ﬁlter. As indicated in Table 41.5, the range and Doppler resolution of any
match-ﬁltered  waveform  are  inversely  proportional  to  the  waveform  bandwidth  and  duration,  respectively.
Pulse compression, using modulated waveforms, is attractive since S/N is proportional to pulse duration rather
than  bandwidth  in  matched  ﬁlter  implementations.  Ideally,  the  intrapulse  modulation  is  chosen  to  attain
adequate range resolution and range sidelobe suppression performance while the pulse duration is chosen to
provide the required sensitivity. Pulse compression waveforms are characterized as having a time bandwidth
product  (TBP)  signiﬁcantly  greater  than  unity,  in  contrast  to  an  unmodulated  pulse,  which  has  a  TBP  of
approximately unity.
