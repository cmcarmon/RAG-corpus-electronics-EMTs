The seriousness of a burn depends on two factors: the extent of the burned area and the depth of the 
burn. Shock can be expected from burns involving 15 percent or more of the body. Burns involving 20 
percent endanger life. Without adequate treatment, burns of over 30 percent are usually fatal. The depth 
of the injury determines whether it is a first, second, or third degree burn.
