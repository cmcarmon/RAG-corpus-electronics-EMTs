This  result  has  many  applications,  since  feedback  systems  have  a  crucial  role  in  constructing  stabilizers,
observers, and ﬁlters for given systems. Fig. 12.2 illustrates the conditions of the corollary. The application of
this result is especially convenient, if system (12.10) is given and only appropriate values k of the feedback are
to be determined. In such cases the locus L(TF1) has to be computed ﬁrst, and then the region of all appropriate
k values can be determined easily from the graph of L(TF1).
