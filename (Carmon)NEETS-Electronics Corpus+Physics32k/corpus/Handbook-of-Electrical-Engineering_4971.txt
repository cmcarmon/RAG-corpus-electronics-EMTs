Under ac conditions 
arise mainly from the movement of free charge carriers (electrons and
ions), space charge polarization, and dipole orientation [Bartnikas and Eichhorn, 1983]. Ionic, space charge,
and dipole losses are temperature- and frequency-dependent, a dependency which is reï¬‚ected in the measured
values of
