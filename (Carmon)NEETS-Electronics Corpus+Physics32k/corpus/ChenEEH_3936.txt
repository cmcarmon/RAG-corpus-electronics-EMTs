Perceptive readers may see that implementation of MLE can
easily become complex and numerically difﬁcult, especially
when the underlying distribution is non-Gaussian. If the par-
ameter to be estimated is a simple scalar, and its admissible
values are limited to a ﬁnite interval, search algorithms can be
employed to guarantee satisfactory results. If this is not the case,
more sophisticated numerical optimization algorithms will be
needed to render good estimation results. Among others, itera-
tive algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson method and the
expectation maximization method are often employed.
