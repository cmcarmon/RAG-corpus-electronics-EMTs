on the other hand, the head, being an assembly of discrete elements, is fairly large and heavy (typical weight
.100 grams), resulting in values of ts that are several times greater than those obtained in magnetic recording
systems. The seek times reported for commercially available optical drives presently range from 20 ms in high-
performance 3.5-in. drives to about 80 ms in larger drives. We emphasize, however, that the optical disk tech-
nology is still in its infancy; with the passage of time, the integration and miniaturization of the elements within
the optical head will surely produce lightweight devices capable of achieving seek times of the order of a few
milliseconds.
