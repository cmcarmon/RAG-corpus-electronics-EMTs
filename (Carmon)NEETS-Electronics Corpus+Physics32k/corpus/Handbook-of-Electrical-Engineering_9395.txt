Computer networks are geographically distributed collections of communication links and switching proces-
sors, the purpose of which is to transport data between computers, workstations, and terminals. In general the
elements  of  a  computer  network  must  follow  compatible  rules  of  operation  together  to  function  effectively.
These rules of operation are known as protocols.
