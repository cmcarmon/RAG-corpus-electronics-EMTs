R1 acts as a load resistor for Q1 (the first stage) and develops the output signal of that stage. Do you 
remember how a capacitor reacts to ac and dc? The capacitor, C1, "blocks" the dc of Q1's collector, but 
"passes" the ac output signal. R2 develops this passed, or coupled, signal as the input signal to Q2 (the 
second stage). This arrangement allows the coupling of the signal while it isolates the biasing of each 
stage. This solves many of the problems associated with direct coupling.
