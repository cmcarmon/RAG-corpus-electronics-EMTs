A second technique for creating a resist involves us-
ing the computer to make the artwork with a CAD or 
drawing program. Draw the design from the component

Print out a positive image 1:1 on transparency or special 
film that can then be transferred to a clean, properly sized 
copper-clad board with an iron and pressure.
