Lead coplanarity is deÔ¨Åned as follows. If a multi-lead part, e.g., IC, is placed on a planar surface, lack of ideal
 requirements
coplanarity exists if the lowest solderable part of any lead does not touch that surface. 
vary depending on the pitch of the component leads and their shape, but generally out-of-plane measurements
should not exceed 4 mils (0.004 in.) for 50-mil pitch devices, and 2 mils for 25-mil pitch devices.
