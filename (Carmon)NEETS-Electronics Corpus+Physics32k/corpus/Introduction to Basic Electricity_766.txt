Multisim provides the user with the tools to analyze 
circuit behavior. The intuitive and easy-to-use  software 
platform combines schematic capture and industry-
standard SPICE simulation into a single integrated 
environment. Multisim abstracts the complexities and 
difficulties of traditional syntax-based simulation, 
so users no longer have to be an expert in SPICE to 
 simulate and analyze circuits. Multisim is available in 
an educational version and a professional version.
