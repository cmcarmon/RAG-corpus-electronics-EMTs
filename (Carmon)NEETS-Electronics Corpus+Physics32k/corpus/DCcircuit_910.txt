• The following conditions are hazardous to measurement (glass) electrodes: high tem-
peratures, extreme pH levels (either acidic or alkaline), high ionic concentration in the
liquid, abrasion, hydroﬂuoric acid in the liquid (HF acid dissolves glass!), and any kind
of material coating on the surface of the glass.
