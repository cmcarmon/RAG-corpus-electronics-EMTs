Brief Interruptions
Brief interruptions can be considered as voltage sags with 100% amplitude (see Fig. 62.9). The cause may be
a blown fuse or breaker opening and the effect an expensive shutdown. For instance, a Ô¨Åve-cycle interruption
at a glass factory has been estimated as $200,000, and a major computer center reports that a 2-second outage
can cost approximately $600,000. The main protection of the customer against such events is the installation
of uninterruptible power supplies or power quality conditioners (discussed later).
