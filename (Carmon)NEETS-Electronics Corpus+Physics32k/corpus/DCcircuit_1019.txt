Millman’s Theorem is very convenient for determining the voltage across a set of parallel
branches, where there are enough voltage sources present to preclude solution via regular
series-parallel reduction method. It also is easy in the sense that it doesn’t require the use of
simultaneous equations. However, it is limited in that it only applied to circuits which can be
re-drawn to ﬁt this form. It cannot be used, for example, to solve an unbalanced bridge circuit.
And, even in cases where Millman’s Theorem can be applied, the solution of individual resistor
voltage drops can be a bit daunting to some, the Millman’s Theorem equation only providing a
single ﬁgure for branch voltage.
