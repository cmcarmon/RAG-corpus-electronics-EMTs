In the case of Module (MOD) 4.0 spur gears:
Normal spur gears (over 17 teeth) have a Pitch circle diameter (PCD) equal to MOD x Number of Teeth.
Corrected spur gears (under 17 teeth) have a PCD equal to MOD x Number of Teeth + MOD.
There are two types of corrected gears:
S0 gearing (x1+x2=zero)
S gearing (x1+x2 not equal to zero)
