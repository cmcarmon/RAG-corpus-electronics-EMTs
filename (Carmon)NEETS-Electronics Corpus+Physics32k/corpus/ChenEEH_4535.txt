To obtain an intuitive feel for what types of manipulations
one performs on f to solve the systems problems previously
mentioned, consider, for example, a classical passive network
synthesis problem. In this problem, one is given the input/
output relation S, and one knows what type of network struc-
ture is desired. For example, a ladder synthesis problem state-
ment consists of a transfer function speciﬁcation and the
‘‘connection information’’ of ladder structure. The S and f are
speciﬁed, and it is desired to determine Z (the components).
Clearly, to ﬁnd Z, one must invert f. In this case, one seeks a
right inverse of f because the uniqueness of Z is not a concern
and f is viewed as ‘‘onto’’ the class of transfer functions of
interest.
