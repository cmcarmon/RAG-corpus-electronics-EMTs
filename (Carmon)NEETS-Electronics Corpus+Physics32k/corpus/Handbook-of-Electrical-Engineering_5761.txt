1. Develop improved nonlinear dynamic load models that are valid at any particular instant and that are
valid  when  voltage  decline  is  severe.  The  lack  of  accurate  load  models  makes  it  difﬁcult  to  accurately
simulate the time behavior and/or assess the cause of the voltage instability. The lack of knowledge of
what constitutes an accurate load model makes accurate postmortem simulation of a particular blackout
a  process  of  making  trial  and  error  assumptions  on  the  load  model  structure  to  obtain  as  accurate  a
simulation as possible that conforms with time records of the event. Accurate predictive simulation of
events that have not occurred is very difﬁcult [Taylor, et al. 1998].
