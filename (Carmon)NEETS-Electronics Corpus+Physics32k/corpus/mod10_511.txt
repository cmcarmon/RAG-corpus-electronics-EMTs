Figure 3-27 shows the incident and reflected waveshapes at several different times. The diagrams in
the left column of figure 3-27 (representing voltage) show the incident wave and its reflection without
change in polarity. In figure 3-27, waveform (1), the incident wave and the reflected wave are added
algebraically to produce the resultant wave indicated by the heavy line. In waveform (2), a zero point
preceding the negative-going cycle of the incident wave is at the end of the line. The reflected wave and
incident wave are 180 degrees out of phase at all points. (The reflected wave is the positive cycle that just
preceded the negative cycle now approaching the end of the line.) The resultant of the incident and

the left. The resultant voltage, shown by the heavy line, has a maximum negative at the end of the line
