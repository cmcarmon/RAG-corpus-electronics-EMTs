The approximate locus of net aerodynamic force on a craft with a single sail is the centre of effort (CE ) at the geometric centre of the sail. Filled with wind, the sail has a roughly spherical polygon shape and if the shape is stable, then the location of centre of effort is stable. On sailing craft with multiple sails, the position of centre of effort varies with the sail plan. Sail trim or airfoil profile, boat trim and point of sail also affect CE.   On a given sail, the net aerodynamic force on the sail is located approximately at the maximum draught intersecting the camber of the sail and passing through a plane intersecting the centre of effort, normal to the leading edge (luff), roughly perpendicular to the chord of the sail (a straight line between the leading edge (luff) and the trailing edge (leech)). Net aerodynamic force with respect to the air stream is usually considered in reference to the direction of the apparent wind (VA) over the surface plane (ocean, land or ice) and is decomposed into lift (L), perpendicular with VA, and drag (D), in line with VA. For windsurfers, lift component vertical to the surface plane is important, because in strong winds windsurfer sails are leaned into the wind to create a vertical lifting component ( FVERT) that reduces drag on the board (hull) through the water. Note that FVERT acts downwards for boats heeling away from the wind, but is negligible under normal conditions.
The three dimensional vector relationship for net aerodynamic force with respect to apparent wind (VA) is:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F_{T}} =\mathbf {L} +\mathbf {D} +\mathbf {F_{VERT}} }

Likewise, net aerodynamic force may be decomposed into the three translational directions with respect to a boat's course over the surface: surge (forward/astern), sway (starboard/port—relevant to leeway), and heave (up/down). The scalar values and direction of these components can be dynamic, depending on wind and waves (for a boat). In this case, FT is considered in reference to the direction of the boat's course and is decomposed into driving force (FR), in line with the boat's course, and lateral force (FLAT), perpendicular with the boat's course. Again for windsurfers, the lift component vertical to the surface plane ( FVERT) is important.

The values of driving force (FR ) and lateral force (FLAT ) with apparent wind angle (α), assuming no heeling, relate to the values of lift (L ) and drag (D ), as follows:
