As a further example, 0.01825 can be expressed 
as  1.825/100,  i.e.  1.825  × 10(cid:1)2. It  can  also  be 
expressed as 18.25/1,000, i.e. 18.25 × 10(cid:1)3. Again, 
the exponent is the same as the number of noughts 
but  the  minus  sign  is  used  to  denote  a  fractional 
multiplier. To summarize: 
 
0.01825 = 1.825 × 10(cid:1)2 = 18.25 × 10(cid:1)3
