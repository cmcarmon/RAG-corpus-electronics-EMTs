At least two factors can contribute to the difficulty of identifying the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype in real-world complex systems.
First, the archetype can be temporarily covered up by shifting the burden, that is, by trying to solve the underlying problem by a symptomatic solution, instead of a fundamental one. This leads to further delaying the investment decision, narrowing the window for effective and timely investment or missing it entirely.
Second, in order to recognize the archetype, a holistic view of the system is required. This can be difficult, since the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can create many issues that management must attend to, in effect preventing them from stepping back and seeing the bigger picture.
