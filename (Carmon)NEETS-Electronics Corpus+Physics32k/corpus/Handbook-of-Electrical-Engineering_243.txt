Analysis of linear circuits rests on two fundamental physical laws that describe how the voltages and currents
in  a  circuit  must  behave.  This  behavior  results  from  whatever  voltage  sources,  current  sources,  and  energy
storage elements are connected to the circuit. A voltage source imposes a constraint on the evolution of the
voltage  between  a  pair  of  nodes;  a  current  source  imposes  a  constraint  on  the  evolution  of  the  current  in  a
branch  of  the  circuit.  The  energy  storage  elements  (capacitors  and  inductors)  impose  initial  conditions  on
currents  and  voltages  in  the  circuit;  they  also  establish  a  dynamic  relationship  between  the  voltage  and  the
current at their terminals.
