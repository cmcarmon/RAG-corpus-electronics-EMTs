Using the differential voltmeter, as shown in figure 1-5, provides one of the most accurate methods
of measuring dc voltage. Typical accuracies attained by this method are â€“ 0.005%. These extremely high
accuracies are achieved by the design of the voltmeter with precision internal reference voltages and
precision resistors. As discussed earlier in NEETS, module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes,
and Power Supplies, most differential voltmeters can be operated as transistor voltmeters (tvm) or as
differential null voltmeters. The tvm mode is used to measure the approximate voltage and polarity of the
unknown voltage being measured. The approximate voltage, as measured in the tvm mode, is then used to
make the initial range and mode switch selections for nulling the input voltage.
