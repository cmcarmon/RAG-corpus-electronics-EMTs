MagneRide is an automotive adaptive suspension with Magnetorheological damper system developed by the Delphi Automotive corporation and now owned by Beijing West Industries (BWI) that uses magnetically controlled dampers, or shock absorbers, for a highly adaptive ride. As opposed to traditional suspension systems, MagneRide has no mechanical valves or small moving parts that can wear out. This system consists of four monotube dampers, one on each corner of the vehicle, a sensor set, and an ECU (electronic control unit) to maintain the system.
