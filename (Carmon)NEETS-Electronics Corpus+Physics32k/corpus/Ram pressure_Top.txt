In physics generally, ram pressure is a pressure exerted on a body that is moving through a fluid medium. It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body. For incompressible flow it is given by:




P
=


1
2


ρ

v

2




{\displaystyle P={\frac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}}

where



P


{\displaystyle P}
is the pressure,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid and



v


{\displaystyle v}
the relative velocity between the body and the fluid; this is the stagnation pressure without static pressure.
