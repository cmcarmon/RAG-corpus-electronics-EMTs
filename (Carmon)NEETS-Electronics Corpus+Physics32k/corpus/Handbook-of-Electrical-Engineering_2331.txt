High-Frequency Large-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET. 
 In the high-frequency large-signal equiv-
alent circuit model of a FET, the Ô¨Åxed charge stored between the gate and the source and between the gate and
the drain is modeled by the gate-to-source and the gate-to-drain capacitances, CGS and CGD, respectively. The
mobile charges between the drain and the source are modeled by the drain-to-source capacitance,  CDS. The
voltage drop through the active channel is modeled by the drain-to-source resistance, RDS. The current through
the channel is modeled by a voltage-controlled current source. For large signals, the gate is sometimes driven
into the forward region, and thus the conductance through the gate is modeled by the gate conductance, Gg.
The conductance from the gate to the drain and from the gate to the source is modeled by the gate-to-drain
and  gate-to-source  resistances,  RGD  and  RGS,  respectively.  A  variable  resistor,  Ri,  is  added  to  model  the  gate
charging time such that the time constant given by RiCGS holds the following relationship
