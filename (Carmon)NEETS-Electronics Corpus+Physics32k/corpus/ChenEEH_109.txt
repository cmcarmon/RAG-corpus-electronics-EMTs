variables in this case. It is assumed that the electrical network
N is connected and that N consists of only resistances, (R),
capacitances (C), inductances (L), including mutual induct-
ances, and independent voltage and current sources. It is also
assumed that all initial inductor currents and initial capacitor
voltages have been replaced by appropriate sources. Further,
the voltage and current variables are all Laplace transforms of
the complex frequency variable s. In N, there can be no circuit
consisting of only independent voltage sources, for if such a
circuit of sources were present, then by KVL, there would be a
linear relationship among the corresponding voltages; this
would violate the independence of the voltage sources. For
the same reason, in N, there can be no cutset consisting of
only independent current sources. Hence, there exists in N a
spanning tree containing all the voltage sources but not current
sources. Such a tree is the starting point for the development of
both the loop and cutset systems of equations.
