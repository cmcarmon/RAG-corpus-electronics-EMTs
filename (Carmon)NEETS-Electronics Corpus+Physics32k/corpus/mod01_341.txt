As you know, the secondary cell can be recharged. Recharging is the process of reversing the 
chemical action that occurs as the cell discharges. To recharge the cell, a voltage source, such as a 
generator, is connected as shown in figure 2-3 view D. The negative terminal of the voltage source is 
connected to the cathode of the cell and the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the 
anode of the cell. With this arrangement the lead sulfate is chemically changed back to sponge lead in the 
cathode, lead peroxide in the anode, and sulfuric acid in the electrolyte. After all the lead sulfate is 
chemically changed, the cell is fully charged as shown in figure 2-3 view A. Once the cell has been 
charged, the discharge-charge cycle may be repeated.
