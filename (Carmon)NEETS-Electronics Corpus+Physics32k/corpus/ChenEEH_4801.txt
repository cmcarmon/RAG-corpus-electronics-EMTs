The proposed conﬁguration of neural dynamic program-
ming has been evaluated, and the results are summarized in
Table 13.2. The simulation results summarized in Table 13.2
were obtained through averaged runs. Speciﬁcally, 100 runs
were performed to obtain the results reported here. Each
run was initialized to random conditions in terms of network
weights. If a run is successful, the number of trials it took to
balance the cart–pole is then recorded. The number of trials
listed in the table corresponds to the one averaged over all
of the successful runs. Therefore, there is a need to record the
percentage of successful runs out of 100. This number is
also recorded in the table. A good conﬁguration is the one
with a high percentage of successful runs as well as a low
average number of trials needed to learn to perform the balan-
cing task.
