other pulses. Neither is it applicable to those pulsed systems in which the duration or position of the
pulses are varied by the modulation frequency. In its simplest form, psk operates on the principle of phase
reversal of the carrier. Each time a mark is received, the phase is reversed. No phase reversal takes place
when a space is received. In binary systems, marks and spaces are called ONES and ZEROS,
respectively, so that a ONE causes a 180-degree phase shift, and a ZERO has no effect on the incoming
signal. Figure 2-25 shows the application of phase-shift keying to an unmodulated carrier [view (A)] in
the af range. For transmission over other than a conductive path, the wave shown in view (D) must be
used as the modulating signal for some other system of modulating an rf carrier.
