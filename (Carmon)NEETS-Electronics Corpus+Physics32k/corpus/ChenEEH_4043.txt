In a digital communication system, the information is pro-
cessed so that it can be represented by a sequence of discrete
messages. The digital source may be the result of sampling and
quantizing an analog source, or it may represent a digital
source such as the contents of a computer memory. When
the source is a binary source, the two possible values 0 and
1 are called bits for binary source.
