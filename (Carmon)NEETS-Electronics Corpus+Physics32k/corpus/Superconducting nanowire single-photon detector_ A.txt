Many of the initial application demonstrations of SNSPDs have been in the area of quantum information, such as quantum key distribution and quantum computing. Other applications include imaging of infrared photoemission for defect analysis in CMOS circuitry, LIDAR, on-chip quantum optics, single plasmon detection, quantum plasmonics, single electron detection, single α and β particles detection, oxygen singlet luminescence detection and ultra-long distance classical communication. A number of companies are commercializing complete single photon detection systems based on superconducting nanowires, including Single Quantum, Photon Spot, sconphoton,Scontel and Quantum Opus.
