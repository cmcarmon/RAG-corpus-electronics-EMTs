and the observed output is y(n) = ya(n) + w(n), where w(n) is the measurement noise at the output. In this
example, the input signal is zero-mean unit variance white Gaussian noise. The signal-to-noise ratio at the
output is 12 dB, and 300 samples of the input and output signals are used. The results for p = 2 are shown
in Fig. 14.21; the true frequency response is given by the solid line, the dotted line is the solution that would
result if no signal restoration were performed, and the dashed line depicts the solution after signal restoration
(25 iterations).
