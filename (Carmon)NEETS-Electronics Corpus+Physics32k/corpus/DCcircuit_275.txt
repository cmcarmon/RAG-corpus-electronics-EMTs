dangerous: the voltage between any point in the circuit and ground (earth) is unpredictable,
because a ground fault could appear at any point in the circuit at any time. The only character
guaranteed to be safe in these scenarios is the bird, who has no connection to earth ground
at all! By ﬁrmly connecting a designated point in the circuit to earth ground (”grounding” the
circuit), at least safety can be assured at that one point. This is more assurance of safety than
having no ground connection at all.
