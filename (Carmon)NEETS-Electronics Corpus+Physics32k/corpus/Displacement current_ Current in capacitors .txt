An example illustrating the need for the displacement current arises in connection with capacitors with no medium between the plates. Consider the charging capacitor in the figure. The capacitor is in a circuit that causes equal and opposite charges to appear on the left plate and the right plate, charging the capacitor and increasing the electric field between its plates. No actual charge is transported through the vacuum between its plates. Nonetheless, a magnetic field exists between the plates as though a current were present there as well. One explanation is that a displacement current ID "flows" in the vacuum, and this current produces the magnetic field in the region between the plates according to Ampère's law:

{\displaystyle I_{D}\!\ }
is the net displacement current that passes through a small surface bounded by the curve C.

The magnetic field between the plates is the same as that outside the plates, so the displacement current must be the same as the conduction current in the wires, that is,

{\displaystyle I_{D}=I\ ,}

which extends the notion of current beyond a mere transport of charge.
Next, this displacement current is related to the charging of the capacitor. Consider the current in the imaginary cylindrical surface shown surrounding the left plate. A current, say I, passes outward through the left surface L of the cylinder, but no conduction current (no transport of real charges) crosses the right surface R. Notice that the electric field between the plates E increases as the capacitor charges. That is, in a manner described by Gauss's law, assuming no dielectric between the plates:

where the sign is negative because charge leaves this plate (the charge is decreasing), and where S is the area of the surface R. The electric field at surface L is nearly zero because the field due to charge on the left-hand plate is nearly cancelled by the equal but opposite charge on the right-hand plate. Under the assumption of a uniform electric field distribution inside the capacitor, the displacement current density JD is found by dividing by the area of the surface:

where I is the current leaving the cylindrical surface (which must equal ID) and JD is the flow of charge per unit area into the cylindrical surface through the face R.

Combining these results, the magnetic field is found using the integral form of Ampère's law with an arbitrary choice of contour provided the displacement current density term is added to the conduction current density (the Ampère-Maxwell equation):

{\displaystyle \oint _{\partial S}{\boldsymbol {B}}\cdot d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}=\mu _{0}\int _{S}\left({\boldsymbol {J}}+\epsilon _{0}{\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {E}}}{\partial t}}\right)\cdot d{\boldsymbol {S}}\,}

This equation says that the integral of the magnetic field B around a loop ∂S is equal to the integrated current J through any surface spanning the loop, plus the displacement current term ε0 ∂E / ∂t through the surface.

As depicted in the figure to the right, the current crossing surface S1 is entirely conduction current. Applying the Ampère-Maxwell equation to surface S1 yields:

{\displaystyle B={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{2\pi r}}\,}

However, the current crossing surface S2 is entirely displacement current. Applying this law to surface S2, which is bounded by exactly the same curve

{\displaystyle \partial S}
, but lies between the plates, produces:

Any surface S1 that intersects the wire has current I passing through it so Ampère's law gives the correct magnetic field. However a second surface S2 bounded by the same loop δS could be drawn passing between the capacitor plates, therefore having no current passing through it. Without the displacement current term Ampere's law would give zero magnetic field for this surface. Therefore without the displacement current term Ampere's law gives inconsistent results, the magnetic field would depend on the surface chosen for integration. Thus the displacement current term ε0 ∂E / ∂t is necessary as a second source term which gives the correct magnetic field when the surface of integration passes between the capacitor plates. Because the current is increasing the charge on the capacitor's plates, the electric field between the plates is increasing, and the rate of change of electric field gives the correct value for the field B found above.
