The horizontal and vertical components of the hydrostatic force acting on a submerged surface are given by the following:









F


h






=

p


c



A





F


v






=
ρ
g
V






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}F_{\mathrm {h} }&=p_{\mathrm {c} }A\\F_{\mathrm {v} }&=\rho gV\end{aligned}}}

where:
pc is the pressure at the centroid of the vertical projection of the submerged surface
A is the area of the same vertical projection of the surface
ρ is the density of the fluid
g is the acceleration due to gravity
V the volume of fluid directly above the curved surface
