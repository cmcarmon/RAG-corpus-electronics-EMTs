Material dispersion occurs because the spreading of a light pulse is dependent on the wavelengths'
interaction with the refractive index of the fiber core. Different wavelengths travel at different speeds in
the fiber material. Different wavelengths of a light pulse that enter a fiber at one time exit the fiber at
different times. Material dispersion is a function of the source spectral width. The spectral width specifies
the range of wavelengths that can propagate in the fiber. Material dispersion is less at longer wavelengths.
