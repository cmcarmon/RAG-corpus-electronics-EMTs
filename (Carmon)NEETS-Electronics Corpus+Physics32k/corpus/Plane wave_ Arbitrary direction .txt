The more general form below represents a plane wave traveling in an arbitrary direction. It uses vectors in combination with the vector dot product.

{\displaystyle A(\mathbf {r} ,t)=A_{o}\cos(\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} -\omega t+\varphi )}

here:





k



{\displaystyle \mathbf {k} }
is the wave vector, which is a vector with a length equal to the wavenumber

{\displaystyle |\mathbf {k} |=k=2\pi /\lambda }
. The direction of the wave vector is ordinarily that direction which the plane wave is traveling, but it can differ in an anisotropic medium.




⋅


{\displaystyle \cdot }
is the vector dot product.





r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is the position vector which defines a point in three-dimensional space.
