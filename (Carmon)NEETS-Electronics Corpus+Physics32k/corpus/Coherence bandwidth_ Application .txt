Frequencies within a coherence bandwidth of one another tend to all fade in a similar or correlated fashion. One reason for designing the CDMA IS-95 waveform with a bandwidth of approximately 1.25 MHz is because in many urban signaling environments the coherence bandwidth Bc is significantly less than 1.25 MHz. Therefore, when fading occurs it occurs only over a relatively small fraction of the total CDMA signal bandwidth. The portion of the signal bandwidth over which fading does not occur typically contains enough signal power to sustain reliable communications. This is the bandwidth over which the channel transfer function remains virtually constant.
