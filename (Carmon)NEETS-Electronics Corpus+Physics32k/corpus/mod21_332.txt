The amount of current that flows in an antenna is one of the most important factors affecting the 
performance of transmitter equipment. As much of the rf energy generated as possible must be efficiently 
transferred to the antennas to secure the maximum radiated power from a transmitter. Also, for best 
reception, maximum transfer of energy from the antenna to the receiver must occur. Efficient 
transmission and reception conditions prevail whenever the transmitter (or receiver) is properly matched 
to the transmission line and the transmission line is properly matched to the antenna. Normally, 
performance tests concerning impedance match consist primarily of taking standing-wave measurements. 
In certain instances, it may be found that a change in antenna impedance has resulted in an undesirably 
high standing-wave ratio. This could be the result of a new antenna installation or an interfering structure 
near the antenna that influences antenna characteristics.
