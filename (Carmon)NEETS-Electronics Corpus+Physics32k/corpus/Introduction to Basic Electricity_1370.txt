An electron has a very small charge, so the charge 
of  6.24  3  1018  electrons  is  added  together  and 
called a coulomb	(C). When 1 coulomb of charge 
moves past a single point in 1 second, it is called an 
 ampere	(a). The ampere is named for the French 
physicist André Marie Ampère (1775–1836), one 
of the early founders of the science of electromag-
netism, which he called electrodynamics. Current is 
measured in amperes.
