for an arbitrary signal x ˛ X. These sets consist of all elements in Ck that lie closest to x in the distance-metric
sense for 1 £ k £ m. It is to be noted that the projection operators Pk(x) are generally nonlinear and not one
to one as was the case in the previous two subsections. When determining the individual projection operators
(14.98), the fundamental issues of the existence and uniqueness of solution need to be addressed. It is tacitly
assumed that the signal attributes and metrics under consideration are such that at least one solution exists
and the solution(s) may be obtained in a reasonably simple fashion. Fortunately, the generation of solutions
imposes  no  serious  restrictions  for  many  commonly  invoked  attribute  sets.  Moreover,  many  relevant  signal
attributes are characterized by the fact that more than one solution to optimization problems (14.98) exists.
The projection operators (14.98) are unusual in that they need not be of the traditional point-to-point variety
as was the case when the attribute set is a closed subspace, closed linear variety or closed convex set. For general
Ck sets,  P k is a point-to-set mapping. The concept of a closed mapping is of importance when extending the
notion of signal restoration to nonconvex sets. A closed mapping is a generalization of the notion of continuity
as applied to standard point-to-point mappings [Zangwill, 1969], that is:
