While the CRT display is one of the oldest, it still remains one of the most popular display
technologies. The raster-scanned display devices work similarly to commercial television sets,
whereas graphics display devices use different technologies to achieve extremely high resolution.
A CRT video signal has only two levels, with a 0 level causing a dark spot and a 1 level causing
a bright spot. The appropriate combination of 1s and 0s displays data on a CRT screen, with each
character displayed by dot-matrix displays, typically in 5 × 7 or 7 × 9 display fonts.
