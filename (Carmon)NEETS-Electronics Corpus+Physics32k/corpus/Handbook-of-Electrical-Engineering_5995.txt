The so-called qd0 transformation in more recent publications is
Park’s transformation expressed in terms of the angle, θ
q, between
the rotor’s q-axis and the axis of the stator’s a-phase winding. The
row  order  of  components  in  the  qd0  transformation  matrix  from
top of bottom is q-, d-, and then 0. As evident from Fig. 66.33, the
d + π/2. The transformation from abc variables
angle θ
to a qd0 reference frame is accomplished with
