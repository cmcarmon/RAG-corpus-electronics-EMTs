Because image coding and indexing are quite overlapping
processes in terms of storage and searching, one approach is to
unify the two problems in a single framework. There has been
a recent shift in trends in terms of transformation used for
frequency domain processing, from DCT to discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) because of DWT’s time frequency and
multiresolution analysis nature. DWT has been incorporated
in modern image and video compression standards like JPEG-
2000 and MPEG-4. One such system that uses DWT for
compression and indexing of images is proposed in Liang et
al. (1999). The wavelet-based image encoding techniques
depend on successive approximate quantization (SAQ) of
wavelet coefﬁcients in different subbands from wavelet decom-
position. The image indexing from DWT encoded image is
mainly based on signiﬁcant coefﬁcients in each subband. Sig-
niﬁcant coefﬁcients in each sub band are recognized as the
ones whose magnitude is greater than a certain threshold,
