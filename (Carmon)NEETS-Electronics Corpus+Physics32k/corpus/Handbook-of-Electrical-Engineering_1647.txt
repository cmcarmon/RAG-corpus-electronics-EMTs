The  Kalman  ﬁlter  has  been  applied  to  solve  many  diverse  real-world  engineering  problems,  including
spacecraft  navigation,  GPS  navigation,  robotics,  air  trafﬁc  control,  missile  guidance,  chemical  plant  control,
stock market prediction, weather prediction, speech recognition, speech encoding and compression, radar target
tracking, satellite orbit estimation, and inertial navigation. See [Sorenson, 1985] for other applications.
