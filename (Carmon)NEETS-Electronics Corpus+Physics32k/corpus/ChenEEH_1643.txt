Motion Picture Expert Group
The motion picture expert group (MPEG) provides a collec-
tion of motion picture compression standards developed by
the IEC. Its goal is to introduce standards for movie storage
and communication applications. These standards include
audio compression representation, video compression repre-
sentation, and system representation. The following subsection
brieï¬‚y outlines the details of three video compression stand-
ards developed by MPEG.
