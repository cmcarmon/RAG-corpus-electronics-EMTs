where vp ¼ lf
is used to obtain the second equality. It is
evident from equation 4.4 that the delay tracks with the dis-
tance traveled, normalized to the wavelength l. The larger the
fraction ‘=l gets, the longer is the delay. For conventional
circuits operated at a low frequency, the fraction ‘=l is small;
hence, the phase delay along the wire can be neglected. At
higher frequencies, the wavelength gets shorter; hence, ‘=l
becomes larger for a ﬁxed ‘. An important effect of the phase
delay is that the line voltage varies with position along the line
because the wave requires a ﬁnite time to travel from the
source location to the measurement location. At low frequen-
cies, these local potential differences are negligible because of
very short transit times. This is not valid, however, when the
line length becomes an appreciable fraction of the operating
wavelength. Equation 4.4 can be generalized to any position z
along the line by writing:
