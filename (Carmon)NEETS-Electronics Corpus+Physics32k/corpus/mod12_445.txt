polarity with respect to the center tap of the winding. Because the winding is inductive, the voltage across
it is 90 degrees out of phase with the current through it. Because of the center-tap arrangement, the
voltages at each end of the secondary winding of T1 are 180 degrees out of phase and are shown as e1 and
e2 on the vector diagram.
