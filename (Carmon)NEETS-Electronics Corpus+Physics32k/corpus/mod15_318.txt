Now let's look at the effect of weight distribution in the rotor of a gyro. Consider three rotors of the 
same weight, as shown in figure 3-6, view (A), view (B), and view (C), with the diameter of one rotor 
half the diameter of the other two. Now, when we spin these rotors at the same speed, we find that the 
rotors with the greater diameter are much more rigid than the one with the smaller diameter. Next, we find 
that we can make the rotors equally rigid by causing the rotor with the smaller diameter to spin faster than 
the larger rotors. Thus rigidity depends both on speed and distribution of weight. The weight of the larger 
rotor being farther away from the axis of spin causes it to be more rigid. This effect is even more 
pronounced if we shape the rotor as shown in view C of figure 3-6. Shifting as much weight as possible to 
the outer rim of the rotor increases rigidity even further.
