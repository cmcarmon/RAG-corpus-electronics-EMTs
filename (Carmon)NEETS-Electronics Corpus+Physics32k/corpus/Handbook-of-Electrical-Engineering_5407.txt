Remote communication systems also beneﬁt from new approaches for power delivery. For example, many
are currently powered by hybrid systems that may contain combinations of small diesel engines, photovoltaics,
thermoelectrics, and batteries. In many remote applications, risk of environmental damage from spilled liquid
fuels limits choices for power generation. TPV systems offer efﬁcient conversion of energy from gaseous sources.
This offers greatly reduced maintenance, reduced delivery cost of maintaining the fuel supply, and improved
environmental acceptance.
