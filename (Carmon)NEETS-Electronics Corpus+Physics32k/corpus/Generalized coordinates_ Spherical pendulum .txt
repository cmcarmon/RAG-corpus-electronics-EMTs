For a 3d example, a spherical pendulum with constant length l free to swing in any angular direction subject to gravity, the constraint on the pendulum bob can be stated in the form




f
(

r

)
=

x

2


+

y

2


+

z

2


−

l

2


=
0

,


{\displaystyle f(\mathbf {r} )=x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-l^{2}=0\,,}

where the position of the pendulum bob can be written





r

=
(
x
(
θ
,
ϕ
)
,
y
(
θ
,
ϕ
)
,
z
(
θ
,
ϕ
)
)

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =(x(\theta ,\phi ),y(\theta ,\phi ),z(\theta ,\phi ))\,,}

in which (θ, φ) are the spherical polar angles because the bob moves in the surface of a sphere. The position r is measured along the suspension point to the bob, here treated as a point particle. A logical choice of generalized coordinates to describe the motion are the angles (θ, φ). Only two coordinates are needed instead of three, because the position of the bob can be parameterized by two numbers, and the constraint equation connects the three coordinates x, y, z so any one of them is determined from the other two.
