Each die rolling above the target number is a success. Most tasks require only a single success, but some require more. Each die rolling a 1 cancels out a success. If the net number of successes is 0 or less, the action is a failure. If no successes were rolled and one or more 1s were also rolled, the action is a botch, resulting in detrimental results to the player.
