The simplest concept is the measurement made using two microphones and a fast recording device such as a digital storage scope. This method uses the following idea.
If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:
The distance between the microphones (x), called microphone basis.
The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (t).
Then v = x/t.
