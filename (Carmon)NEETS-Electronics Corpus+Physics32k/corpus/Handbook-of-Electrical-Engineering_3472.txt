The expression of the governing heat transfer relations in the form of thermal resistances greatly simpliﬁes
the ﬁrst-order thermal analysis of electronic systems. Following the established rules for resistance networks,
thermal resistances that occur sequentially along a thermal path can be simply summed to establish the overall
thermal  resistance  for  that  path.  Similarly,  the  reciprocal  of  the  effective  overall  resistance  of  several  parallel
heat  transfer  paths  can  be  found  by  summing  the  reciprocals  of  the  individual  resistances.  In  reﬁning  the
thermal  design  of  an  electronic  system,  prime  attention  should,  then,  be  devoted  to  reducing  the  largest
resistances along a speciﬁed thermal path and/or providing parallel paths for heat removal from a critical area.
While the thermal resistances associated with various paths and thermal transport mechanisms constitute
the building blocks in performing a detailed thermal analysis, they have also found widespread application as
ﬁgures-of-merit in evaluating and comparing the thermal efﬁcacy of various packaging techniques and thermal
management strategies. The determination of the relevant thermal resistances is, thus, the key task in the thermal
design of an electronic system.
