As you remember from chapter 1, before the ohmmeter is used, power must be removed from the
circuit and the component being checked should be isolated from the circuit. The best way to isolate the
switch is to remove it from the circuit completely. This is not always practical, and it is sometimes
necessary to check a switch while there is power applied to it. In these cases, you would not be able to use
an ohmmeter to check the switch, but you can check the switch by the use of a voltmeter.
