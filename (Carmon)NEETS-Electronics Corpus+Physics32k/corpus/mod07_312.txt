The characteristic curve for the SCR is shown in figure 3-19. With no gate current, the leakage 
current remains very small as the forward voltage from cathode to anode is increased until the breakdown 
point is reached. Here the center junction breaks down, the SCR begins to conduct heavily, and the drop 
across the SCR becomes very low.
