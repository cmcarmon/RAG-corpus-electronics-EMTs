Central extensions of a Lie algebra g by an abelian Lie algebra a can be obtained with the help of a so-called (nontrivial) 2-cocycle (background) on g. Non-trivial 2-cocycles occur in the context of projective representations (background) of Lie groups. This is alluded to further down.

is a central extension if ker s is contained in the center Z(c) of c.
Properties
Since the center commutes with everything, h ≅ im i = ker s in this case is abelian.
Given a central extension e of g, one may construct a 2-cocycle on g. Suppose e is a central extension of g by h. Let l be a linear map from g to e with the property that s ∘ l = Idg, i.e. l is a section of s. Use this section to define ε: g × g → e by

{\displaystyle \epsilon (G_{1},[G_{2},G_{3}])+\epsilon (G_{2},[G_{3},G_{1}])+\epsilon (G_{3},[G_{1},G_{2}])=0\in {\mathfrak {e}}.}

To see this, use the definition of ε on the left hand side, then use the linearity of l. Use Jacobi identity on g to get rid of half of the six terms. Use the definition of ε again on terms l[Gi,Gj] sitting inside three Lie brackets, bilinearity of Lie brackets, and the Jacobi identity on e, and then finally use on the three remaining terms that Im ε ⊂ ker s and that ker s ⊂ Z(e) so that ε(Gi, Gj) brackets to zero with everything. It then follows that φ = i−1 ∘ ε satisfies the corresponding relation, and if h in addition is one-dimensional, then φ is a 2-cocycle on g (via a trivial correspondence of h with the underlying field).
