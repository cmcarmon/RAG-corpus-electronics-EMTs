With staging, the delta-v of each stage can be calculated via the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation and summed:

{\displaystyle \Delta v=\sum _{i=1}^{n}V_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot \ln \left({\frac {M_{\mathrm {initial} }}{M_{\mathrm {final} }}}\right)}

Where




V

{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {e} }}
is the effective exhaust velocity,

{\displaystyle M_{\mathrm {initial} }}
the initial mass, and

{\displaystyle M_{\mathrm {final} }}
the mass of the rocket at the point of burnout of each stage.
When the

{\displaystyle V_{\mathrm {e} }}
and mass ratios are the same for all the stages, this simplifies to:

{\displaystyle \Delta v=nV_{\mathrm {e} }\cdot \ln(M_{\mathrm {ratio} })}

and it can be seen that the delta-v is limited only by n, the number of stages. Note that this equation does not account for relativistic effects that would place further limitations on delta-v.
