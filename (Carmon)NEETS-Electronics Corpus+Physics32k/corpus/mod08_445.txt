If the saturable-core reactor works, why do we need to add a rectifier to produce a magnetic
amplifier? To answer this question, recall that in NEETS, Module 2â€”Introduction to Alternating Current
and Transformers, you were told about hysteresis loss. Hysteresis loss occurs because the a.c. applied to a
coil causes the tiny molecular magnets (or electron-spin directions) to realign as the polarity of the a.c.
changes. This realignment uses up power. The power that is used for realignment is a loss as far as the
rest of the circuit is concerned. Because of this hysteresis loss in the saturable-core reactor, the power
gain is relatively low. A rectifier added to the load circuit will eliminate the hysteresis loss and increase
the gain. This is because the rectifier allows current to flow in only one direction through the load coils.
