For the general case when the network contains resistors, capacitors, and induc-
tors, the power flow will have some intermediate form between Figure 13.52
and Figure 13.53. Assuming that the circuit is net inductive at the frequency of
interest, then θ is positive but less than π/2, and Equation 13.149 with φ = 0
becomes
