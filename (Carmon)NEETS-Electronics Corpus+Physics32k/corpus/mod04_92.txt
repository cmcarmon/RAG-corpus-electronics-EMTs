The friction tape should be started slightly back on the original insulation. Wind the tape so that each 
turn overlaps the one before it. Extend the tape over onto the insulation at the other end of the splice. 
From this point, a second layer is wound back along the splice until the original starting point is reached. 
Cutting the tape and firmly pressing down the ends completes the job. When proper care is taken, the 
splice and insulation can take as much abuse as the rest of the original wire.
