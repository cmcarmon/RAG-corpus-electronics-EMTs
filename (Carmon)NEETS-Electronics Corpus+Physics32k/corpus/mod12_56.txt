Another term that is important in the discussion of a sine wave is its duration, or PERIOD. The 
period of a cycle is the elapsed time from the beginning of a cycle to its completion. If the vector shown 
in figure 1-3 were to make 1 revolution per second, each cycle of the resultant sine wave would have a 
period of 1 second. If it were rotating at a speed of 1,000 revolutions per second, each revolution would 
require 1/1,000 of a second and the period of the resultant sine wave would be 1/1,000 of a second. This 
illustrates that the period is related to the frequency. As the number of cycles completed in 1 second 
increases, the period of each cycle will decrease proportionally. This relationship is shown in the 
following formulas:
