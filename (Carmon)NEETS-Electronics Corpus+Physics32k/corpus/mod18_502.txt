Bus transfer equipment is installed on switchboards, at load centers, on power panels, and on loads 
that are fed by both normal and alternate and/or emergency feeders (figure 4-11). Either the normal or 
alternate source of the ship's service power can be selected. Emergency power from the emergency 
distribution system can be used if an emergency feeder is also provided.
