If one point had appeared due east of the other, one finds the approximate curvature in the east–west direction.
This radius of curvature in the prime vertical which is perpendicular (normal or orthogonal) to M at geodetic latitude φ is:

{\displaystyle N(\varphi )={\frac {a^{2}}{\sqrt {(a\cos \varphi )^{2}+(b\sin \varphi )^{2}}}}\,.}

This radius is also called the transverse radius of curvature. At the equator, N = R.

The Earth's meridional radius of curvature at the equator equals the meridian's semi-latus rectum:
b2/a = 6,335.439 km
The Earth's polar radius of curvature is:
a2/b = 6,399.594 km
