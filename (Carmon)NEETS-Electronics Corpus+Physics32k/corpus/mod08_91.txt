RC coupling does have a few disadvantages. The resistors use dc power and so the amplifier has low 
efficiency. The capacitor tends to limit the low-frequency response of the amplifier and the amplifying 
device itself limits the high-frequency response. For audio amplifiers this is usually not a problem; 
techniques for overcoming these frequency limitations will be covered later in this module.
