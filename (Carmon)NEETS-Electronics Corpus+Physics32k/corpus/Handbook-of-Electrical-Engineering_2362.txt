Equations to Be Solved. As a starting point, Poisson’s equation is solved to obtain the electric ﬁeld inside the
device. Using the Monte Carlo technique (MCT), the BTE is solved to obtain the carrier distribution function,
f. In the MCT, the path of one or more carriers, under the inﬂuence of external forces, is followed, and from
