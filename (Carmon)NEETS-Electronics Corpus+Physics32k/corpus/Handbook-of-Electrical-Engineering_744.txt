Step 3
The tree branches R1, C3, and vg are assigned the voltage symbols v1, v3, and vg; and the cotree-links R2, L4, i5 ,
and  ig are assigned the current symbols  i2 ,  i4,  i3, and  ig, respectively. The controlled current source i5 is given
the current symbol i3 because its current is controlled by the current of the branch C3, which is i3.
Step 4
Applying Kirchhoff â€™s current law, the branch currents i1, i3, and i7 can each be expressed as the sums of cotree-
link currents:
