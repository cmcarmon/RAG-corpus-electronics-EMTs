The process begins with gas under some pressure,

, confined to one half of a thermally isolated container (see the top part of the drawing at the beginning of this article). The gas occupies an initial volume

(see the bottom part of the drawing). A thermometer inserted into the compartment on the left (not shown in the drawing) measures the temperature of the gas before and after the expansion.
The system in this experiment consists of both compartments; that is, the entire region occupied by the gas at the end of the experiment. Because this system is thermally isolated, it cannot exchange heat with its surroundings. Also, since the system's total volume is kept constant, the system cannot perform work on its surroundings. As a result, the change in internal energy,

U


{\displaystyle \Delta U}
, is zero. Internal energy consists of internal kinetic energy (due to the motion of the molecules) and internal potential energy (due to intermolecular forces). Temperature is the measure of the internal kinetic energy; therefore a change in temperature indicates a change in kinetic energy. Since the total internal energy does not change, there must be an offsetting change in potential energy. Because of this, the Joule expansion provides information on intermolecular forces.
