The resistance of a piece of material depends on its geometry. As illustrated in
Figure A.12, assume the resistor has a conducting channel with cross-sectional
area a, length l, and resistivity ρ. This channel is terminated at its extremes by
two conducting plates that extend to form the two terminals of the resistor.
