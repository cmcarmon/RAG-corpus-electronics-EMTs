The classical ideal gas law may be written:






p
V
=
n
R
T

.


{\displaystyle {\ pV=nRT}.}

In the form shown above, the equation of state is thus




f
(
p
,
V
,
T
)
=
p
V
−
n
R
T
=
0


{\displaystyle f(p,V,T)=pV-nRT=0}
.
If the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows






p
=
ρ
(
γ
−
1
)
e



{\displaystyle {\ p=\rho (\gamma -1)e}}

where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density,



γ
=

C

p



/


C

v




{\displaystyle \gamma =C_{p}/C_{v}}
is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats),



e
=

C

v


T


{\displaystyle e=C_{v}T}
is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"),




C

v




{\displaystyle C_{v}}
is the specific heat at constant volume, and




C

p




{\displaystyle C_{p}}
is the specific heat at constant pressure.
