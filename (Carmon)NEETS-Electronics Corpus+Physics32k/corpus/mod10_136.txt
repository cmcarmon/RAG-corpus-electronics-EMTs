Current light theory says that light is made up of very small packets of electromagnetic energy called
PHOTONS (the smallest unit of radiant energy). These photons move at a constant speed in the medium
through which they travel. Photons move at a faster speed through a vacuum than they do in the
atmosphere, and at a slower speed through water than air.
