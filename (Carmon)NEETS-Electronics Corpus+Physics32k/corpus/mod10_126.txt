At some time during your life you probably observed someone putting his or her head into an empty
barrel or other cavity and making noises varying in pitch. When that person's voice reached a certain
pitch, the tone produced seemed much louder than the others. The reason for this phenomenon is that at
that a certain pitch the frequency of vibrations of the voice matched the resonant (or natural) frequency of
the cavity. The resonant frequency of a cavity is the frequency at which the cavity body will begin to
vibrate and create sound waves. When the resonant frequency of the cavity was reached, the sound of the
voice was reinforced by the sound waves created by the cavity, resulting in a louder tone.
