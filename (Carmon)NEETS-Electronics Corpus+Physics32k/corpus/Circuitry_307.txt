A full-wave  bridge  rectifier  arrangement  is  shown 
in Fig. 6.15. Mains voltage (240 V) is applied to the 
primary  of  a  step-down  transformer  (Tl).  The 
secondary  winding  provides  12  V 
r.m.s. 
(approximately 17 V peak) and has a turns ratio of 
20:1,  as  before.  On  positive  half-cycles,  point  A 
will  be  positive  with  respect  to  point  B.  In  this 
condition  Dl  and  D2  will  allow  conduction  while 
D3 and D4 will not allow conduction. Conversely, 
on  negative  half-cycles,  point  B  will  be  positive 
with  respect  to  point  A.  In  this  condition  D3  and 
D4 will allow conduction while Dl and D2 will not 
allow conduction. 
  Figure  6.16  shows  the  bridge  rectifier  circuit 
with  the  diodes  replaced  by  four  switches.  In  
Fig. 6.16(a) Dl and D2 are conducting on a positive 
half-cycle  while  in  Fig.  6.16(b)  D3  and  D4  are 
conducting. Once again, the result is that current is 
routed  through  the  load  in  the  same  direction  on 
successive  half-cycles.  As  with 
the  bi-phase 
rectifier,  the  switching  action  of  the  two  diodes 
results 
in  a  pulsating  output  voltage  being 
developed across the load resistor (RL). Once again, 
the  peak  output  voltage  is  approximately  16.3  V 
(i.e. 17 V less the 0.7 V forward threshold voltage).  
  Figure  6.16  shows  how  a  reservoir  capacitor 
(C1)  can  be  added  to  maintain  the  output  voltage 
when 
the  diodes  are  not  conducting.  This 
component operates in exactly the same way as for
