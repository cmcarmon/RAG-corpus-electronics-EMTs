 refers to problems caused by a failure to include vital information. Such errors
are frequently encountered in requirements, speciÔ¨Åcations, source code, and user documents. An example of
such an error became highly visible on February 29, 1992, when it was discovered that the calendar routine for
a particular application omitted leap year calculations, thus shutting down the system at midnight on the 28th.
From 15% to more than 30% of the post-deployment problems encountered in software can be traced to errors
of omission. The probability and frequency of such errors rises with the size of the system.
