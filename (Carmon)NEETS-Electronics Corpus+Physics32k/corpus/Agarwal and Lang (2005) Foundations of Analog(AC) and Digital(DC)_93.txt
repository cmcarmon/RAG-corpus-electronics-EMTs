The intuition behind the first constraint is as follows. The definition of the
voltage (or the potential difference) between a pair of points across an element
is the work required to move a particle with unit charge from one point to the
other along some path against the force due to the electrical field. For the lumped
abstraction to hold, we require that this voltage be unique, and therefore the
voltage value must not depend on the path taken. We can make this true by
selecting element boundaries such that there is no time-varying magnetic flux
outside the element.
