1. While node analysis is generally quite simple,
it is complicated by the presence of floating
independent voltage sources and by the presence of dependent sources. Note that a floating inde-
pendent voltage source is a source that has neither terminal connected to ground, neither directly
nor through one or more other independent voltage sources. Consequently, we first introduce
node analysis without these complications, and then treat these complications in succession.
