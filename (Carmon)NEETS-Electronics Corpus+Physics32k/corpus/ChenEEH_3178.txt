When chemical bonds in hydrocarbons are broken, free
carbon is generated, which is conducted even in the dry
state. This is obviously not desirable. The formation of a
carbonaceous conducting path on the surface of composite
materials is called tracking. Materials can be formulated such
that the carbon is physically dislodged from the surface or
removed in the form of gaseous products. Such modes of
carbon removal will lead to a loss of material, which is termed
erosion. Erosion is a much slower mode of degradation
than tracking. Hence, the resistance to tracking and erosion
of materials is an extremely important aspect of composite
insulators.
