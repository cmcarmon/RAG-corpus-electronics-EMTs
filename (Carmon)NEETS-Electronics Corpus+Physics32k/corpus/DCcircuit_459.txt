As you can see from the arrangement of the data, we can’t apply the 9 volts of ET (total
voltage) to any of the resistances (R1, R2, or R3) in any Ohm’s Law formula because they’re in
different columns. The 9 volts of battery voltage is not applied directly across R1, R2, or R3.
However, we can use our ”rules” of series circuits to ﬁll in blank spots on a horizontal row. In
this case, we can use the series rule of resistances to determine a total resistance from the sum
of individual resistances:
