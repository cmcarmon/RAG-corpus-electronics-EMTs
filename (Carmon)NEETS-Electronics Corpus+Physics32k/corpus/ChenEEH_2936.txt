Equation 10.66 is Bojarski’s identity and shows that the object
shape can be reconstructed by measuring the backscattered far-
Y
ﬁeld over all
K . Since the PO approximation is valid only at
high frequencies and for smooth convex conducting surfaces,
Bojarski’s identity has its own theoretical limitation. Another
practical difﬁculty is that the measured far-ﬁeld data should be
complete over ‘‘all’’ frequencies and ‘‘all’’ aspect angles. How-
ever, this difﬁculty is common to almost all the inversion
algorithms. In spite of these difﬁculties, Bojarski’s identity is
useful for reconstructing the shape of a large, smooth convex
conductor for which the multiple scattering effect can be
neglected. Moreover, the algorithm is also efﬁcient in compu-
tation because it makes use of the fast Fourier transform
(FFT).
