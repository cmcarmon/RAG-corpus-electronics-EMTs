A point mass in probability and statistics does not refer to mass in the sense of physics, but rather refers to a finite nonzero probability that is concentrated at a point in the probability mass distribution, where there is a discontinuous segment in a probability density function. To calculate such a point mass, an integration is carried out over the entire range of the random variable, on the probability density of the continuous part. After equating this integral to 1, the point mass can be found by further calculation.
