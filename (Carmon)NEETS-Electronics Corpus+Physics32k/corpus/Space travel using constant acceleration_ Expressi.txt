How far one travels, experiencing constant acceleration, from the point of view of Earth as a function of the traveler's time is expressed by the coordinate distance x as a function of proper time τ at constant proper acceleration a. It is given by:

{\displaystyle x(\tau )={\frac {c^{2}}{a}}\left(\cosh {\frac {a\ \tau }{c}}-1\right),}

where c is the speed of light.
Under the same circumstances, the time elapsed on Earth (the coordinate time) as a function of the traveler's time is given by:
