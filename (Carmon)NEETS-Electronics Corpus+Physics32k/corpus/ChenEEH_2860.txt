ampliﬁcation block, the band-select ﬁlter block, the matched
ﬁlter block, and the demodulation block. The ampliﬁcation
block increases the amplitude of the incoming signal to levels
usable in the post stages—band-select ﬁlter block, the matched
ﬁlter block, and the demodulation block. The band-select ﬁlter
block rejects out-of–band interference. The matched ﬁlter
block shapes the signals and noise to gain the maximum
signal-to-noise ratio. The demodulation function block re-
moves the carrier and translates the signal to its information
frequencies or baseband.
