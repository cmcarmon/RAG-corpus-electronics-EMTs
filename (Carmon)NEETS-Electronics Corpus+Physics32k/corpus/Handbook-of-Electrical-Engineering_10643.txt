As far as the general service lamps are concerned, the most common incandescent lamps — 40, 60, 75, 100,
and 150 W — are not covered by an efﬁciency standard because there is no suitable method to ensure energy
savings. These types, however, are covered by another provision of the law, namely the energy efﬁciency labeling
standards.
