through it is decreased. As described by Lenzâ€™s Law, the induced voltage will be opposed to the
change in current. With a decreasing current, the voltage polarity will be oriented so as to try
to keep the current at its former magnitude. In this scenario, the inductor will be acting as a
source, with the negative side of the induced voltage on the end where electrons are exiting,
and the positive side of the induced voltage on the end where electrons are entering. The more
rapidly current is decreased, the more voltage will be produced by the inductor, in its release
of stored energy to try to keep current constant.
