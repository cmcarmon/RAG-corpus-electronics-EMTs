Another application is modeling. When we buy a ﬂashlight battery, either equivalent circuit can accu-
rately describe it. These models help us understand the limitations of a battery. Since batteries are labeled
with a voltage speciﬁcation, they should serve as voltage sources and the Thévenin equivalent serves as the
natural choice. If a load resistance RL is placed across its terminals, the voltage output can be found using
veq. If we have a load resistance much larger than the battery’s equivalent
voltage divider: v =
resistance, then, to a good approximation, the battery does serve as a voltage source. If the load resistance
is much smaller, we certainly don’t have a voltage source (the output voltage depends directly on the load
resistance). Consider now the Mayer-Norton equivalent; the current through the load resistance is given by
current divider, and equals i = −
ieq. For a current that does not vary with the load resistance,
this resistance should be much smaller than the equivalent resistance. If the load resistance is comparable
to the equivalent resistance, the battery serves neither as a voltage source or a current course. Thus, when
