Bipolar coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system. There are two commonly defined types of bipolar coordinates. The first is based on the Apollonian circles. The curves of constant σ and of τ are circles that intersect at right angles. The coordinates have two foci F1 and F2, which are generally taken to be fixed at (−a, 0) and (a, 0), respectively, on the x-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system. The second system is two-center bipolar coordinates. There is also a third coordinate system that is based on two poles (biangular coordinates).
The term "bipolar" is sometimes used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and Cassini ovals. However, the term bipolar coordinates is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used to describe coordinates associated with those other curves, such as elliptic coordinates.
