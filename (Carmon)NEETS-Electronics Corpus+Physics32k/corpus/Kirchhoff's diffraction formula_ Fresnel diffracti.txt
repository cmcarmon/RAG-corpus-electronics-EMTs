When the quadratic terms cannot be neglected but all higher order terms can, the equation becomes the Fresnel diffraction equation. The approximations for the Kirchhoff equation are used, and additional assumptions are:
r and s are significantly greater than the size of the aperture,
third- and higher-order terms in the expression f(x', y') can be neglected.
