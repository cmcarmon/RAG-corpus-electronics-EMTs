Several advantages do exist on this calendar, mainly related to its organization. When compared to the Gregorian, it is clear that this calendar is much simpler and practical:
every year has exactly 52 weeks divided in 13 months;
each month has exactly 28 days divided in 4 weeks;
every month/year's day has the same week day (i.e. n'th month/year day is always the m'th week's day, where m is the remainder of n/7).
The Tranquility calendar is perennial, keeping the same days per year, and the same days per week, which are two advantages that ease possible change. On this proposal, the number of national holidays that do not fall on weekends are no longer year dependent. This no longer causes certain years to have more workdays than others.
