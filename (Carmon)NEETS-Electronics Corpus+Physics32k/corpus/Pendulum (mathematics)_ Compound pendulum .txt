A compound pendulum (or physical pendulum) is one where the rod is not massless, and may have extended size; that is, an arbitrarily shaped rigid body swinging by a pivot. In this case the pendulum's period depends on its moment of inertia I around the pivot point.
The equation of torque gives:




τ
=
I
α



{\displaystyle \tau =I\alpha \,}

where:
α is the angular acceleration.
τ is the torque
The torque is generated by gravity so:




τ

sin

θ



{\displaystyle \tau =-mgL\sin \theta \,}

where:
m is the mass of the body
L is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the pendulum
θ is the angle from the vertical
Hence, under the small-angle approximation sin θ ≈ θ,

{\displaystyle \alpha =\theta ''\approx -{\frac {mgL\theta }{I_{\mathrm {cm} }+mL^{2}}}}

where Icm is the moment of inertia of the body about its center of mass.
The expression for α is of the same form as the conventional simple pendulum and gives a period of
