Rotationalâ€“vibrational coupling occurs when the rotation frequency of an object is close to or identical to a natural internal vibration frequency. The animation on the right shows a simple example. The motion depicted in the animation is for the idealized situation that the force exerted by the spring increases linearly with the distance to the center of rotation. Also, the animation depicts what would occur if there would not be any friction.
In rotational-vibrational coupling there is an oscillation of the angular velocity. In pulling the circling masses closer to the center of rotation, the force exerted by the spring (a centripetal force) is doing work, converting stored strain energy in the spring into kinetic energy of the masses. As a consequence of that, the angular velocity increases. The force of the spring cannot pull the circling masses all the way to the center, for as the circling masses are moving closer to the center of rotation the force exerted by the spring gets weaker, and the velocity is steadily increasing. At some point the velocity has increased so much that the object starts to swing wide again, re-entering a phase of building up strain energy.
In helicopter design damping devices must be incorporated, because at specific angular velocities vibrations of the rotorblades can be reinforced by rotational-vibrational coupling, and build up catastrophically. Without the damping the vibrations will cause the rotorblades to break loose.
