On	the	process	of	building	a	circuit	and	modifying	its	design,	an	understanding	of
different	circuit	symbols	is	important.	Descriptions	of	circuit	components	can	be
put	in	simple	words;	it	is	called	a	verbal	description.	However,	since	a	thorough
approach	is	recommended	in	many	circuitry	lessons,	a	visual	representation	can
enable	you	to	understand	the	electric	flow	in	a	circuit.
Hereâ€™s	a	good	comparison:
