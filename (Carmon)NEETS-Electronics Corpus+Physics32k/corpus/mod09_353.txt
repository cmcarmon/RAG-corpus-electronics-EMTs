One alternation is called a PULSE. The time for one complete cycle is called the PULSE-
REPETITION TIME (prt). The number of times in 1 second that the cycle repeats itself is called the 
PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY (prf) or PULSE-REPETITION RATE (prr). If each alternation in 
figure 3-2 is 200 microseconds (Âµs), the prt will be 400 microseconds, and the prf will be 2,500 hertz. The 
following examples are provided to illustrate the mathematical relationship between prf and prt:
