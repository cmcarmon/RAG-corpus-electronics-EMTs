Active Noise and Sound Control
Active  noise  control  (ANC)  is  a  way  to  reduce  the  sound  pressure  level  of  a  given  noise  source  through
electroacoustic means. ANC and echo cancellation are somewhat related. While even acoustic echo cancellation
is actually done on electrical signals, ANC could be labeled “wave cancellation,” since it involves using one or
more  secondary  acoustic  or  vibrational  sources.  Another  important  difference  is  the  fact  that  in  ANC  one
usually would like to cancel a given noise in a whole region in space, while echo cancellation commonly involves
only one microphone picking up the echo signal at a single point in space. Finally, the transfer function of the
transducer used to generate a cancellation (“secondary source”) signal needs to be considered in ANC.
