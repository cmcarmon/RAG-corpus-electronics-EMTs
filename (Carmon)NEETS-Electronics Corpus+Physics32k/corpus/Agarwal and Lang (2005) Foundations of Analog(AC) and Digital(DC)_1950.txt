To find the effect of VS acting alone, namely Vgss, we short out Vi, and
obtain the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 13.42a. The MOSFET has infinite
input impedance, so it does not figure in the calculation of Vgss. (We ignore the
MOSFETâ€™s gate capacitance for simplicity.) Vgss can now be found through a
