This astounding rate of progress shows no sign of slowing. Fundamental limits to magnetic recording density
are still several orders of magnitude away, and recent product announcements and laboratory demonstrations
indicate the industry is accelerating the rate of progress rather than approaching practical limits. Recently IBM
demonstrated  the  feasability  of  storing  information  at  a  density  of  3  Gbit/in.2  [Tsang  et  al.,  1996].  Similar
advances can also be expected in audio and video recording.
