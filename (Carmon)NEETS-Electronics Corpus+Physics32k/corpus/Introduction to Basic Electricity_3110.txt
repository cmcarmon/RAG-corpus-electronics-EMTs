When a reverse-bias voltage is applied that is high 
enough to cause breakdown in a zener diode, a high 
reverse current (IZ) flows. The reverse current is low 
until breakdown occurs. After breakdown, the reverse  
current increases rapidly. This occurs because the 
 resistance of the zener diode decreases as the reverse 
voltage increases.
