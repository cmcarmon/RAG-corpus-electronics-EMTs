The surface-emitting LED (shown in figure 6-1) is also known as the Burrus LED in honor of C. A.
Burrus, its developer. In SLEDs, the size of the primary active region is limited to a small circular area of
20 m m to 50 m m in diameter. The active region is the portion of the LED where photons are emitted. The
primary active region is below the surface of the semiconductor substrate perpendicular to the axis of the
fiber. A well is etched into the substrate to allow direct coupling of the emitted light to the optical fiber.
The etched well allows the optical fiber to come into close contact with the emitting surface. In addition,
the epoxy resin that binds the optical fiber to the SLED reduces the refractive index mismatch, increasing
coupling efficiency.
