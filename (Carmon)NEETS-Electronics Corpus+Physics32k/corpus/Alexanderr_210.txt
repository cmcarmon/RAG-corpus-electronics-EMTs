To Ô¨Ånd the Norton equivalent involves similar steps except that we
insert a probing independent voltage source (with a part name VSRC),
say, Vp,  at  the  terminals. We  perform  a  DC  Sweep  on Vp  and  let Vp
vary from 0 to 1 V in 0.1-V increments. A plot of the current through
Vp versus the voltage across Vp is obtained using the Probe menu after
simulation. The zero intercept is equal to the Norton current, while the
slope of the plot is equal to the Norton conductance.
