The dynamic NC method has the following advantages: (1)
better utilization of track resources—this will mean a higher
rate of successful reconﬁgurations and thus greater fault toler-
ance; (2) fast on-line reconﬁguration; (3) greater ﬂexibility in
tolerating fault patterns; (4) minimal changes in a circuit’s
electrical properties, including timing and power; (5) applic-
ability to both cell and interconnect faults; and (6) applicabil-
ity to other domains, such as online testing and diagnosis,
wherein a ‘‘roving tester’’ can move around the FPGA during
FPGA run time to test different parts of the FPGA (this
requires run-time reconﬁguration of the FPGA for remapping
the working circuit and the tester) (Verma et al., 2001).
