The above calculations assume that the stiffness coefficient of the spring does not depend on its length. However, this is not the case for real springs. For small values of



M

/

m


{\displaystyle M/m}
, the displacement is not so large as to cause elastic deformation. Jun-ichi Ueda and Yoshiro Sadamoto have found that as



M

m


{\displaystyle M/m}
increases beyond 7, the effective mass of a spring in a vertical spring-mass system becomes smaller than Rayleigh's value

{\displaystyle m/3}
and eventually reaches negative values. This unexpected behavior of the effective mass can be explained in terms of the elastic after-effect (which is the spring's not returning to its original length after the load is removed).
