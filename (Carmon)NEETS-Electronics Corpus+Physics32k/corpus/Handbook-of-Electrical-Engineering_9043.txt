When the thermal energy in the superheated layer is depleted, the bubble begins to collapse. The total cycle
(nucleation  plus  bubble  growth  and  collapse)  is  normally  complete  in  about  20  ms.  Drop  rate,  however,  is
typically limited to less than 10 kHz, mainly because of the limits of thermal dissipation. Cavitation damage
can occur to the heater structure if the bubble collapse is too violent. Proper design of the ink chamber geometry
can provide the necessary damping and minimize this problem. Heater element materials used for this tech-
nology  include  HfB2,  ZrB2,  Ta2Al  and  TaN.  Passivation  over-layers  (e.g.,  SiC,  SiO2,  Si3N4,  plus  certain  metals
such  as  tantalum)  are  deposited  on  top  of  the  thin-ﬁlm  heaters  to  provide  protection  from  chemical  and
mechanically  enhanced  corrosion.  Materials,  structures  and  thin-ﬁlm  deposition  processes  must  be  carefully
