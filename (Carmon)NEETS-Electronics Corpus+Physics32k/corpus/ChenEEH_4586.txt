Modern intelligent optimization techniques, such as genetic
algorithms,
immune algorithms, simulated annealing, and
reinforcement learning, have been exploited in a variety of
areas and applications (Chun et al., 1997; Chun et al., 1998;
Marchesi et al., 1994; Tanaka and Yoshida, 1999; Marchesi,
1998; Juang et al., 2000; Offner, 2000; Ho and Huang, 2000).
Although the effectiveness in achieving successful optimization
objectives has been demonstrated, most of them are still
applied in off-line situations due to the time-consuming itera-
tive process. From the computational complexity point of
view, and the well-known and efÔ¨Åcient gradient descent algo-
rithm will be considered and used in the rest of this chapter
because of its popularity and effectiveness in online applica-
tions. The optimization procedure is shown as follows.
