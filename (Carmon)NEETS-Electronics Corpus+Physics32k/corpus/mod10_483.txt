If a voltage is initially applied to the sending end of a line, that same voltage will appear later some
distance from the sending end. This is true regardless of any change in voltage, whether the change is a
jump from zero to some value or a drop from some value to zero. The voltage change will be conducted
down the line at a constant rate.
