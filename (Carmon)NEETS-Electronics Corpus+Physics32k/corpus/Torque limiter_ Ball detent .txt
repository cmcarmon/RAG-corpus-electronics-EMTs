A ball detent type limiter transmits force through hardened balls which rest in detents on the shaft and are held in place with springs. An over-torque condition pushes the balls out of their detents, thereby decoupling the shaft. It can have single or multiple detent positions, or a snap acting spring which requires a manual reset. There may be a compression adjustment to adjust the torque limit.
Many cordless drills incorporate this type of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may be a part of an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the planet carrier as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the planet carrier to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.
