The most common cause of INTERMODULATION DISTORTION is improper spacing of
transmitters and receivers. CROSS MODULATION is common to equipment that is misaligned.
Intermodulation distortion can be tested by injecting two signals (different frequencies) into a piece of
equipment and then monitoring its output for distortion using a spectrum analyzer. Intermodulation
distortion is usually caused by improper antenna spacing or by poorly shielded components or circuits.
