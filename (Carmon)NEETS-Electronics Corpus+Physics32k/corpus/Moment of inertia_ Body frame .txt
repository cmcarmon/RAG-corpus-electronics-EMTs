Let the body frame inertia matrix relative to the centre of mass be denoted IBC, and define the orientation of the body frame relative to the inertial frame by the rotation matrix A, such that,





x

=

A


y

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =\mathbf {A} \mathbf {y} ,}

where vectors y in the body fixed coordinate frame have coordinates x in the inertial frame. Then, the inertia matrix of the body measured in the inertial frame is given by






I



C



=

A



I



C



B




A



T



.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} _{\mathbf {C} }=\mathbf {A} \mathbf {I} _{\mathbf {C} }^{B}\mathbf {A} ^{\mathsf {T}}.}

Notice that A changes as the body moves, while IBC remains constant.
