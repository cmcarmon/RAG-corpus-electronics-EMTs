The gating multivibrator is also triggered by the negative spike from the differentiated square wave.
This stage applies a 2,000-microsecond negative gate to the 14-megahertz oscillator. The oscillator
operates for 2,400 microseconds and is then cut off. Because the delay line time is 2,500 microseconds,
the 14-megahertz oscillations stop before the initial waves reach the end of the delay line. This wave
train, when detected and differentiated, turns the gating multivibrator on, producing another 2,400-
microsecond wave train. The 100 microseconds of the delay line is necessary to ensure that the
mechanical waves within the line have time to damp out before the next pulse-repetition time. In this
manner the pulse-repetition time of the radar set is controlled by the delay of the mercury, or quartz delay
line. Because this delay line is also common to the video pulses going to the comparison point, the
delayed and the undelayed video pulses will arrive at exactly the same time.
