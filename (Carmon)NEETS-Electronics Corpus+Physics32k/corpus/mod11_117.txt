OUTPUT POWER.â€”The variation in output power for different modes of operation can be 
explained by examining the factors which limit the amplitude of oscillations. Power and amplitude 
limitations are caused by the DEBUNCHING process of the electrons in the repeller field space. 
Debunching is simply the spreading out of the electron bunches before they reach electrostatic fields 
across the cavity grid . The lower concentration of electrons in the returning bunches provides less power 
for delivery to the oscillating cavity. This reduced power from the bunches, in turn, reduces the amplitude 
of the cavity oscillations and causes a decrease in output power. In higher modes of operation the electron 
bunches are formed more slowly. They are more likely to be affected by debunching because of mutual 
repulsion between the negatively charged electrons. The long drift time in the higher modes allows more 
time for this electron interaction and, as a result, the effects of debunching are more severe. The mutual 
repulsion changes the relative velocity between the electrons in the bunches and causes the bunches to 
spread out.
