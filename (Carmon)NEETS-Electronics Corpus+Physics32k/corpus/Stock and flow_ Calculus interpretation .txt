If the quantity of some stock variable at time




t



{\displaystyle \,t\,}
is




Q
(
t
)



{\displaystyle \,Q(t)\,}
, then the derivative







d
Q
(
t
)


d
t






{\displaystyle \,{\frac {dQ(t)}{dt}}\,}
is the flow of changes in the stock. Likewise, the stock at some time t is the integral of the flow from some time when the time was zero until time t.
For example, if the capital stock




K
(
t
)



{\displaystyle \,K(t)\,}
is increased gradually over time by a flow of gross investment





I

g


(
t
)



{\displaystyle \,I^{g}(t)\,}
and decreased gradually over time by a flow of depreciation




D
(
t
)



{\displaystyle \,D(t)\,}
, then the instantaneous rate of change in the capital stock is given by







d
K
(
t
)

{\displaystyle {\frac {dK(t)}{dt}}=I^{g}(t)-D(t)=I^{n}(t)}

where the notation

{\displaystyle \,I^{n}(t)\,}
refers to the flow of net investment, which is the difference between gross investment and depreciation.
