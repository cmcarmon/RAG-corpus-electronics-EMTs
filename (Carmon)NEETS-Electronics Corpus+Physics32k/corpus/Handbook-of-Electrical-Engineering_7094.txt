Discussion of various data compression algorithms for sources like speech and images can be found in the IEEE
Transactions on Communications and the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, while the theoretical under-
pinnings of compression algorithms are discussed in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
