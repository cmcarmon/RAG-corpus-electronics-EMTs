Another  category  of  transducer  uses  variation  of  the  shape  of  the  electrodes  and  the  geometry  of  the
electroacoustic coupling region so that the transfer function between a transmitting and a receiving transducer
is made to have a prescribed frequency response. Such geometries ﬁnd wide application in ﬁltering and pulse
compression applications in the frequency range up to a few gigahertz. Because of the ease of fabrication of
complicated electrode geometries, special forms of the solution of the wave equation, Eq. (48.1), called surface
acoustic  waves  (SAW)  are  dominant  in  such  applications.  Because  surface  acoustic  waves  are  discussed  in
another section of this handbook, here we will conﬁne the discussion to transducers that generate or detect
acoustic waves that are almost plane and usually single mode, the so-called bulk modes.
