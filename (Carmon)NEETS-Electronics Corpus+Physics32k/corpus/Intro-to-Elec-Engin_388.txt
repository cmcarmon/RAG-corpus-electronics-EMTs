Electronic systems usually process information in either analog or digital form. In order to process
the two different kinds of signals, analog circuits and digital circuits have been devised. While
almost all technology was of the analog type until around 1960, due to the advent of integrated
circuits (ICs), digital technology has grown tremendously.
