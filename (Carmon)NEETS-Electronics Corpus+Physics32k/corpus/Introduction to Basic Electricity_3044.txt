The reverse-biased voltage increases the barrier 
voltage. If the barrier voltage is equal to the external 
voltage source, holes and electrons cannot support 
current flow. A small current flows with a reverse bias 
applied. This leakage current is referred to as reverse 
current (iR) and exists because of minority carri-
ers. At room temperature, the minority carriers are 
few in number. As the temperature increases, more
