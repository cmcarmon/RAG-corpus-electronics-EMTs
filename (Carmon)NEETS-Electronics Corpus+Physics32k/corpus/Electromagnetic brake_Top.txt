Electromagnetic brakes (also called electro-mechanical brakes or EM brakes) slow or stop motion using electromagnetic force to apply mechanical resistance (friction). The original name was "electro-mechanical brakes" but over the years the name changed to "electromagnetic brakes", referring to their actuation method. Since becoming popular in the mid-20th century especially in trains and trams, the variety of applications and brake designs has increased dramatically, but the basic operation remains the same.
Both electromagnetic brakes and eddy current brakes use electromagnetic force but electromagnetic brakes ultimately depend on friction and eddy current brakes use magnetic force directly.
