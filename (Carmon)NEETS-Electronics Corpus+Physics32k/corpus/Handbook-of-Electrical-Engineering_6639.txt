protocol. The AAL for signaling at UNI and NNI will be common as much as possible. In contrast to the NNI,
at the UNI meta-signaling is necessary. Meta-signaling establishes, checks, and removes the signaling channels
between customer equipment and the central ofÔ¨Åce in a dynamic way. The signaling channels at the NNI are
semipermanent and, therefore, meta-signaling is not required.
