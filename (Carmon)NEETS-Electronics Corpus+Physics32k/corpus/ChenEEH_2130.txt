methods are discussed in Chapter 8. Chapter 8 also describes
a frequency-domain integral-equation based approach known
as the method of moments. This method is particularly useful
when the Green’s function (the kernel) can be found analyti-
cally. This section also discusses the recent progress of using
a fast algorithm to deal with large electromagnetic systems.
Chapter 9 describes a time-domain differential equation-based
approach known as the ﬁnite-difference time-domain (FDTD)
method. This method is particularly useful for complicate
noncanonical or nonlinear structures with impulsive sources.
The volume of the structure usually dictates computer time
and memory required. Perfect absorbing boundary facilitates
fast computation with minimum required memory.
