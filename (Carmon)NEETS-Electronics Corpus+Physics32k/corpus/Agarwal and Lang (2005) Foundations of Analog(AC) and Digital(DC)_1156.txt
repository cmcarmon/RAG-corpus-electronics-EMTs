e n c e a m p l i f i e r The difference amplifier is a building block for high-quality
amplification and is useful for processing small signals. When a signal is noisy, straight-
forward use of an amplifier would amplify both the signal and the noise. However,
under certain conditions that we will see shortly, a difference amplifier (also called a
differential amplifier) can be used to amplify the signal by a much larger gain relative
to the noise. Difference amplifiers are also used in building operational amplifiers, and
suitable difference amplifier circuits are discussed in Examples 7.19 and 8.10.
