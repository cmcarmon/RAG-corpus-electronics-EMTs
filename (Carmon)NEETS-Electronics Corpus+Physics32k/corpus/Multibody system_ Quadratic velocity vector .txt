In the case of rigid bodies, the so-called quadratic velocity vector





Q


v




{\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} _{v}}
is used to describe Coriolis and centrifugal terms in the equations of motion. The name is because





Q


v




{\displaystyle \mathbf {Q} _{v}}
includes quadratic terms of velocities and it results due to partial derivatives of the kinetic energy of the body.
