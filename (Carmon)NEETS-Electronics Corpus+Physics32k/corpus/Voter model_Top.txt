In the mathematical theory of probability, the voter model is a stochastic process that is a specific type of interacting particle system (see Probabilistic Cellular Automata too). A voter model is a sequential dynamical system and it is similar to the contact process.

One can imagine that there is a "voter" at each point on a connected graph, where the connections indicate that there is some form of interaction between a pair of voters (nodes). The opinions of any given voter on some issue changes at random times under the influence of opinions of his neighbours. A voter's opinion at any given time can take one of two values, labelled 0 and 1. At random times, a random individual is selected and that voter's opinion are changed according to a stochastic rule. Specifically, for one of the chosen voter's neighbors is chosen according to a given set of probabilities and that individual's opinion is transferred to the chosen voter.
An alternative interpretation is in terms of spatial conflict. Suppose two nations control the areas (sets of nodes) labelled 0 or 1. A flip from 0 to 1 at a given location indicates an invasion of that site by the other nation.
Note that only one flip happens each time. Problems involving the voter model will often be recast in terms of the dual system of coalescing Markov chains. Frequently, these problems will then be reduced to others involving independent Markov chains.
