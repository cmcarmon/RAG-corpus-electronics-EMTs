Wien's displacement law shows how the spectrum of black-body radiation at any temperature is related to the spectrum at any other temperature. If we know the shape of the spectrum at one temperature, we can calculate the shape at any other temperature. Spectral intensity can be expressed as a function of wavelength or of frequency.
A consequence of Wien's displacement law is that the wavelength at which the intensity per unit wavelength of the radiation produced by a black body is at a maximum,




λ

max




{\displaystyle \lambda _{\max }}
, is a function only of the temperature:

{\displaystyle \lambda _{\max }={\frac {b}{T}},}

where the constant b, known as Wien's displacement constant, is equal to 2.8977729(17)×10−3 K m.
Planck's law was also stated above as a function of frequency. The intensity maximum for this is given by
