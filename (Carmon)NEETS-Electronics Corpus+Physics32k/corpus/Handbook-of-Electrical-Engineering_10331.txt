The ODU consists of a solid-state power ampliﬁer (SSPA), a low-noise ampliﬁer, upconverter, and a down-
converter. VSAT SSPA modules are usually between 1.0 to 3.0 W. The ODU cost can be signiﬁcantly lowered
by utilization of a low-power SSPA (0.1 to 0.5 W) consistent with obtaining the required output power. The
VSAT receive side front end can be economically conﬁgured using an LNB. Low-cost HEMT LNBs are currently
available with 50–60 dB gain and noise ﬁgures lower than 1.3 dB.
