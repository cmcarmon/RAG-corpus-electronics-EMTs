Channel Length Modulation
After pinch-off occurs at the drain end, the length of the
inversion layer and, hence, the channel resistance continually
decrease as the drain bias is raised above VD, sat . In long
channel devices, the length of the pinch-off region is negligibly
small. Since the voltage drop across the channel is pinned at
VD, sat , drain current increases only negligibly. However, in
short channel devices, this pinch-off region can become a
signiﬁcant fraction of the total channel length. This reduction
length manifests itself as a ﬁnite slope in the
of channel
