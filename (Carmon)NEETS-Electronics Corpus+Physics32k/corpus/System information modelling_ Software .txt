A commercial proprietary software package, Dynamic Asset Delivery (DAD), has been developed based on the concept of SIM by I&E Systems Pty Ltd.
The initial version of DAD was released in 1997 which was primarily a modelling tool used to design and document the electrical engineering system. Since born DAD has been tested and applied to many projects including but not limited to greenfield and brownfield, power, control and ICT systems. The DAD software has been continuously maintained and upgraded to cater for complex and rapid changing EICS projects. The latest release of DAD is version 12 which incorporates of a number of 'Portals' that can be applied to the entire life-cycle of a project including SIM Design Portal, Review Portal, Procurement Portal, Construction Portal, Commissioning Portal and Maintenance Portal. It also provides a facility to create Process Layers, Power Layers, Functional Layers and Comms layers to help to further understand the way a system operates.
