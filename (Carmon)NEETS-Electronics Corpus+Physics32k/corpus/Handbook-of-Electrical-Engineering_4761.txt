 (lead [Pb], magne-
material which has seen appli-
sium niobate), typically doped with 
cations where the absence of hysteresis is important. For example, deformable mirrors require repositioning
of the reﬂecting surface to a deﬁned location regardless of whether the old position was above or below the
original position.
