While opinions vary as to its proper definition, the most common definition of a Planck particle is a particle whose Compton wavelength is equal to its Schwarzschild radius. This sets the relationship:




λ
=


h

m
c



=



2
G
m


c

2






{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{mc}}={\frac {2Gm}{c^{2}}}}

Thus making the mass of such a particle:




m
=




h
c


2
G






{\displaystyle m={\sqrt {\frac {hc}{2G}}}}

This mass will be





π




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {\pi }}}
times larger than the Planck mass, making a Planck particle 1.772 times more massive than the Planck unit mass.
Its radius will be the Compton wavelength:




r
=


h

m
c



=




2
G
h


c

{\displaystyle r={\frac {h}{mc}}={\sqrt {\frac {2Gh}{c^{3}}}}}

The Planck length ℓP is defined as

{\displaystyle \ell _{\mathrm {P} }={\frac {r}{2{\sqrt {\pi }}}}={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar G}{c^{3}}}}}
