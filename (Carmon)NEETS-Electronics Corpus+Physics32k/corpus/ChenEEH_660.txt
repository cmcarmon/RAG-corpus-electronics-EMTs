The goal of a storage device is in general to store a number
of n-bit data words for a short- or long-term period. Under
control of the address unit(s), these data words are transferred
to the custom processing units (called processors further on) at
the appropriate point in time (cycle), and the results of the
operations are then written back in the storage device for
future use. Due to the different characteristics of storage and
access, different styles of devices have been developed.
