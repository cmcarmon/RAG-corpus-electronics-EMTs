There are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.
The Boussinesq approximation neglects variations in density except to calculate buoyancy forces. It is often used in free convection problems where density changes are small.
Lubrication theory and Heleâ€“Shaw flow exploits the large aspect ratio of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.
Slender-body theory is a methodology used in Stokes flow problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.
The shallow-water equations can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a free surface, in which surface gradients are small.
Darcy's law is used for flow in porous media, and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.
In rotating systems, the quasi-geostrophic equations assume an almost perfect balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force. It is useful in the study of atmospheric dynamics.
