Free body diagrams are used to visualize the forces and moments applied to a body and calculate the resulting reactions, in many types of mechanics problems. Most free body diagrams are used both to determine the loading of individual structural components as well as calculating internal forces within the structure in almost all engineering disciplines from Biomechanics to Structural. In the educational environment, learning to draw a free body diagram is an important step in understanding certain topics in physics, such as statics, dynamics and other forms of classical mechanics.
