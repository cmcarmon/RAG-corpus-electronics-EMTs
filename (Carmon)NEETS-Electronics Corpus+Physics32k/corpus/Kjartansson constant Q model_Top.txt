The Kjartansson constant Q model uses mathematical Q models to explain how the earth responds to seismic waves and is widely used in seismic geophysical applications. Because these models satisfies the Krämers–Krönig relations they should be preferable to the Kolsky model in seismic inverse Q filtering. Kjartanssons model is a simplification of the first of Azimi Q models  (1968).
