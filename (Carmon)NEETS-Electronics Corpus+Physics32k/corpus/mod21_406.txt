Any type of resonant circuit may be used in wavemeter applications. The exact kind of circuit 
employed depends on the frequency range for which the meter is intended. Resonant circuits consisting of 
coils and capacitors are used for low-frequency wavemeters. Butterfly circuits, adjustable transmission 
line sections, and resonant cavities are used in vhf and microwave instruments.
