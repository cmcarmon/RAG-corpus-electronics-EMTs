function, whereas the natural frequency ωn of a system provides a measure of the settling time
(see Figure 16.2.6). The settling time is no greater than ts = 3/ξ ωn for the response to a step input
to reach 95% of its steady-state value. For a 1% tolerance band, the settling time is no greater than
ts = 5/ξ ωn. Figure 16.2.10 depicts the percent maximum overshoot as a function of the damping
ratio ξ for a linear second-order system. For two different systems having the same damping ratio
ξ, the one with the larger natural frequency will have the smaller settling time in responding to
input commands or load disturbances.
The particular form of the forced solution of Equation (16.2.26) depends upon the type of
forcing function used. If a step input of magnitude r0 is applied, then R(s) = r0/s, so that the
complete transformed solution becomes
C(s) =
