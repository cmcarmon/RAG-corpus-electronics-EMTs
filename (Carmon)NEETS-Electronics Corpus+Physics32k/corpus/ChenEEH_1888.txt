System failures are caused by erroneous transitions of the
system state, due to either the failure of a system component or
erroneous design. An error is a defective value in the system
state that is liable to lead to failure: an error can lead to a
failure depending on the system composition (applied redun-
dancy) or on the activity of the system (an error may be
overwritten). The adjudged or hypothesized cause of an error
is a fault. This relation can be schematized as in Figure 8.1.
