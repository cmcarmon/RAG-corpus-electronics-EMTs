A spherical Gaussian surface is used when finding the electric field or the flux produced by any of the following:
a point charge
a uniformly distributed spherical shell of charge
any other charge distribution with spherical symmetry
The spherical Gaussian surface is chosen so that it is concentric with the charge distribution.
As an example, consider a charged spherical shell S of negligible thickness, with a uniformly distributed charge Q and radius R. We can use Gauss's law to find the magnitude of the resultant electric field E at a distance r from the center of the charged shell. It is immediately apparent that for a spherical Gaussian surface of radius r < R the enclosed charge is zero: hence the net flux is zero and the magnitude of the electric field on the Gaussian surface is also 0 (by letting QA = 0 in Gauss's law, where QA is the charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface).
With the same example, using a larger Gaussian surface outside the shell where r > R, Gauss's law will produce a non-zero electric field. This is determined as follows.
The flux out of the spherical surface S is:

This non-trivial result shows that any spherical distribution of charge acts as a point charge when observed from the outside of the charge distribution; this is in fact a verification of Coulomb's law. And, as mentioned, any exterior charges do not count.
