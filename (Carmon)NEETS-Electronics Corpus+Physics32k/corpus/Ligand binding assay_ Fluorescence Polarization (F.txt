Fluorescence polarization is synonymous with fluorescence anisotropy. This method measures the change in the rotational speed of a fluorescent-labeled ligand once it is bound to the receptor. Polarized light is used in order to excite the ligand, and the amount of light emitted is measured. Depolarization of the emitted light depends on ligand being bound (e.g., to receptor). If ligand is unbound, it will have a large depolarization (ligand is free to spin rapidly, rotating the light). If the ligand is bound, the combined larger size results in slower rotation and therefore, reduced depolarization. An advantage of this method is that it requires only one labeling step. However, this method is less precise at low nanomolar concentrations.
