A transmission line is used to transfer a signal from the
generator to the load, as in Figure 4.1, by guiding an electro-
magnetic (EM) wave between two conductors. In microwave
communications, the signal is usually some form of modula-
tion on a high-frequency carrier. The generator circuit repre-
sents the Thevenin equivalent (a voltage Vg in series with an
impedance Zg ) of the EM wave’s source, such as a radar
transmitter, a continuous tone source, or a high-speed data
terminal. The load ZL represents the equivalent impedance at
the terminals of the receiver (e.g., the transmitting antenna’s
input impedance).
