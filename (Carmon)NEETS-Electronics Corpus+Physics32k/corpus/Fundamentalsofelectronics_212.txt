This transfer function has many important properties and provides all the insights needed to determine
how the circuit functions. First of all, note that we can compute the frequency response for both positive and
negative frequencies. Recall that sinusoids consist of the sum of two complex exponentials, one having the
negative frequency of the other. We will consider how the circuit acts on a sinusoid soon. Do note that the
