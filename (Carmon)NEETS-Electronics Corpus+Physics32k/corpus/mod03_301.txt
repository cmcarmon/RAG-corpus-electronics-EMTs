The first compact, workable circuit breaker was developed in 1923. It took 4 years to design a device
that would interrupt circuits of 5000 amperes at 120 volts ac or dc. In 1928 the first circuit breaker was
placed on the market. A typical circuit breaker and the appropriate schematic symbols are shown in figure
2-2.
