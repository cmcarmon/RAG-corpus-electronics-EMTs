The LRSVM Morava system is based on a modified FAP 1118 4x4 military truck that provides a good tactical mobility. It is equipped with a double container with 12â€“16 launching tubes, which can fire all current Plamen, Oganj and Grad rockets, including HE-FRAG, incendiary, thermobaric, cluster with anti-personnel or anti-tank mines. It is possible to combine two different modules for example one container with Plamen A and one container with Grad rockets giving a unique capabilities of attacking close and ranged targets in the same time.
Range and direction correction system provides better accuracy with respect to its predecessors. The Morava can launch single rocket, partial ripple or full salvo, which can cover an area of 32 hectares. The LRSVM is equipped with fully automatic targeting control systems. The launch vehicle is fitted with an Inertial Navigation System (INS), GPS unit and absolute encoders for automatic positioning. Vehicle has ballistic computer with automatic or manual data input and firing elements computation. Rockets are launched directly form the cab or remotely form the vehicle. The LRSVM can fire single rockets or full salvo. A crew of three prepares this artillery system for firing within 45 seconds. It leaves firing position within 30 seconds.
The Morava launching vehicle is reloaded within 5 minutes and a full salvo duration is 15-25s depending on rocket type.
While traveling the rocket launcher is covered by hydraulically operated canvas cover (first such camouflage world implementation was on M-77 Oganj), which makes it hard to recognize, as vehicle looks like an ordinary light utility truck. Also it protects the launcher from adverse weather effects.
There is a export version of LRSVM Morava on FAP 1318.
