A microprocessor can be characterized by the width of its internal and external buses. The
width of the internal bus determines the largest number that can be transferred or processed
in a single clock cycle. The width of the external bus determines the number of memory
addresses accessible by the processor. A wider bus is faster and more convenient for the
programmer. A narrower bus is cheaper and requires simpler external hardware with fewer
wires and connections.
