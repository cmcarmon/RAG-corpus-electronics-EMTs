Minicomputers, developed in the early 1960s, are high-performance, general-purpose multi-
user computers. These are also designed for real-time dedicated applications. The PDP-11 series
from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) have been the most prominent 16-bit minicomputers,
and are now obsolete. The 32-bit minicomputers, known as superminis, were developed in the
1970s, the most prominent one being the VAX 8600 from DEC, which was capable of executing
about 5 million instructions per second (MIPS). New VAX lines with larger MIPS have been
developed since.
