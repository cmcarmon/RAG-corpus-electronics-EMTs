The equivalent circuit of Figure 13.2.5(c), redrawn for convenience in Figure 13.2.6, is
usually employed for the analysis. The core losses, most of which occur in the stator, as well as
friction, windage, and stray-load losses, are included in the efﬁciency calculations. The power-
ﬂow diagram for an induction motor is given in Figure 13.2.7, in which m1 is the number of stator
phases, φ1 is the power factor angle between ¯V1 and ¯I1, φ2 is the power factor angle between ¯E1
and ¯I

2, T is the internal electromagnetic torque developed, ωs is the synchronous angular velocity
in mechanical radians per second, and ωm is the actual mechanical rotor speed given by ωs (1−S).
The total power Pg transferred across the air gap from the stator is the difference between the
electric power input Pi and the stator copper loss. Pg is thus the total rotor input power, which is
dissipated in the resistance R
