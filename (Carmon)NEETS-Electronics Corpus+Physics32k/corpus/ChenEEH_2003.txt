As in the register ﬁle, a DWB is used to support microrollback in
cache memory. The only modiﬁcation for a cache, presented by
Tamir and Tremblay (1990), is the use of two CAMs instead of
one. In this case, each CAM checks only one part of the address,
and, thus, the response time of the DWB is smaller. This is done
to achieve better performance on cache microrollback support.
The cache CAMs’ behavior for R/W operations and for rollback
is exactly the same as that of the CAM for the register ﬁle.
