The symbol and standard labeling for the operational amplifier are shown in
Figure 15.3a. The two required external power supplies have been explicitly
shown in the diagram, although showing them is not the usual practice. All five
currents have been labeled, in addition to appropriate node voltages, referred to
the indicated common ground terminal. In this primitive circuit, the voltage vi
is used to control the output voltage vo. Let us examine this control function in
detail to find out both the extent of the control, and the cost of the control; that
is, how much power must be applied from source vi to control a given amount
of power at the vo terminal. To address the first problem, we set up the circuit
exactly as in Figure 15.3, and measure the output voltage vo, both as a function
of time and as a function of vi, assuming vi is some low-frequency sinusoid.
The results are shown in Figures 15.3b and 15.3c. Note the difference in scale
of the voltage axes, indicating that the output voltage is perhaps 300,000 times
as large as the input voltage. The plot of vo versus vi shows a region around
the origin where vo is fairly linearly related to vi, but much beyond this range
the control becomes ineffective, and vo stays at a fixed voltage, or saturates, at
roughly either +12 volts or âˆ’12 volts, depending on the polarity of vi. The
curves will also differ for different samples of the same Op Amp type.
