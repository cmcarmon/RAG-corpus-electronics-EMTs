without  continuous  operator 
intervention.  The 
output of a self-regulating system is fed back to its 
input in order to produce what is known as a closed 
loop  system.  A  good  example  of  a  closed-loop 
system is a heating control system that is designed 
to  maintain  a  constant  room  temperature  and 
humidity within a building regardless of changes in 
the outside conditions. 
 
In simple terms, a microcontroller must produce 
a specific state on each of the lines connected to its 
output ports in response to a particular combination 
of states present on each of the lines connected to 
its  input  ports  (see  Fig.  11.11).  Microcontrollers 
must  also  have  a  central  processing  unit  (CPU) 
capable  of  performing  simple  arithmetic,  logical 
and timing operations. 
  The  input  port  signals  can  be  derived  from  a 
number of sources including:
