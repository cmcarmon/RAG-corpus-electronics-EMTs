If a quantity Q of heat is added to a body while it does expansion work W on its surroundings, one has




Δ
H
=
Δ
U
+
Δ
(

)

.


{\displaystyle \Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta (PV)\,.}

If this is constrained to happen at constant pressure with ΔP = 0, the expansion work W done by the body is given by W = P ΔV; recalling the first law of thermodynamics, one has

and

.


{\displaystyle \Delta U=Q-W=Q-P\,\Delta V{\text{   and   }}\Delta (PV)=P\,\Delta V\,.}

Consequently, by substitution one has

In this scenario, the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system. Since many processes do take place at constant pressure, or approximately at atmospheric pressure, the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of 'heat content'. It is sometimes also called the heat function.
In terms of the natural variables S and P of the state function H, this process of change of state from state 1 to state 2 can be expressed as

It is known that the temperature T(S, P) is identically stated by

{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial H}{\partial S}}\right)_{P}\equiv T(S,P)\,.}

Consequently,

{\displaystyle \Delta H=\int _{S_{1}}^{S_{2}}T(S,P)\mathrm {d} S\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\text{at constant pressure.}}}

In this case, the integral specifies a quantity of heat transferred at constant pressure.
