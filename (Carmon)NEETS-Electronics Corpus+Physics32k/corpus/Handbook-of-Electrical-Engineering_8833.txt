Hashing
The fastest method for the implementation of functions is hash coding or hashing. By means of a hash function,
h ˛ Dom ﬁ 0 .. k–1, the domain of the function is partitioned into k sections and each section is associated
with an index. For each partition a simple list implementation is used and the lists are stored in an array A:
