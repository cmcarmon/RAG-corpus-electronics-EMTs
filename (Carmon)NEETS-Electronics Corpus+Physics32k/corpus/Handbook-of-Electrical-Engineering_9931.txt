It is seen from Fig. 100.29 that the phase-lag compensator reduces the high-frequency gain of the open-loop
function relative to the low-frequency gain. This effect allows a higher low-frequency gain, with the advantages
listed  above.  The  pole  and  zero  of  the  compensator  must  be  placed  at  very  low  frequencies  relative  to  the
compensated-system bandwidth so that the destabilizing effects of the negative phase of the compensator are
negligible.
