The relation between mass concentration and density of a pure component (mass concentration of single component mixtures) is:





ρ

i


=

ρ

i


∗





V

i


V





{\displaystyle \rho _{i}=\rho _{i}^{*}{\frac {V_{i}}{V}}\,}

where ρ∗i is the density of the pure component, Vi the volume of the pure component before mixing.
