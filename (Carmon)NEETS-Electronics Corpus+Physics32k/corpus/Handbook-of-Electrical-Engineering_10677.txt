FIGURE 108.8  Aliasing  diagram.  The  two  baseband  frequencies,  f1  and  f2,  have  aliases  at  frequencies  that  intersect  the
vertical dashed lines. For example, using a sampling frequency of 10 kHz (Fn = 5 kHz) with f1 = 1 kHz and f2 = 3.5 kHz,
signals at 9 kHz (f1a) and 11 kHz (f1b) would be aliased to 1 kHz (f1), while signals at 6.5 kHz (f2a) and 13.5 kHz (f2b) would
be aliased to 3.5 kHz (f2).
