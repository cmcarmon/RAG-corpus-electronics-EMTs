You should be aware that whenever data is transferred between devices, it also involves an exchange 
of prearranged signals. This is known as handshaking. These signals, in combination with a prearranged 
pattern of message characters, define the rules for exchanging data over a communications line. The exact 
rules depend upon each individual computer manufacturer, the telephone company, and the related 
devices (the modems) that make up the computer system. Protocol is the term used for the specific set of 
rules that govern handshaking and message characters.
