Data Buses
As noted earlier, data buses are the key to the emerging integrated avionics architectures. Table 102.1 summarizes
the major features of the most commonly used system buses. MIL-STD-1553 and ARINC 429 were the ﬁrst
data buses to be used for general aircraft data communications. These are used today widely in military and
civil avionics, respectively, and have demonstrated the signiﬁcant potential of data buses. The others listed in
the table build on their success.
