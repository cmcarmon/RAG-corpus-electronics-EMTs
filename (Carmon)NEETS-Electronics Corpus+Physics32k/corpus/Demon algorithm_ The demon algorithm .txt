The full procedure can be summarized by the following steps:
1. Perform a random change in the state of a randomly chosen particle (e. g. change velocity or position).
2. Calculate the change in energy



Δ
E


{\displaystyle \Delta E}
of the thermal system.
3. Negative



Δ
E


{\displaystyle \Delta E}
, i. e. excess energy, is given to the demon by adding

{\displaystyle |\Delta E|}
to the demon. This case (

{\displaystyle \Delta E<0}
) is always accepted.
4. The demon provides positive



Δ
E


{\displaystyle \Delta E}
to keep the total energy constant only if it has sufficient energy, i. e.

{\displaystyle E_{d}>\Delta E}
. In this case the change is accepted, otherwise the randomly chosen change in velocity is rejected and the algorithm is restarted from the original microscopic state.
5. If the change is accepted, repeat the algorithm for the new configuration.
Since energy fluctuations per degree of freedom are only of order 1/N, the presence of the demon has little effect on macroscopic properties of systems with high numbers of particles. After many iterations of the algorithm, the interplay of demon and random energy changes equilibrates the system. Assuming that a particular system approaches all possible states over very long times (quasi-ergodicity), the resulting Monte Carlo dynamics realistically sample microscopic states that correspond to the given energy value. This is only true if macroscopic quantities are stable over many Monte Carlo steps, i. e. if the system is at equilibrium.
