If we satisfy the Sampling Theorem’s conditions, the signal will change only slightly during each pulse. As
we narrow the pulse, making ∆ smaller and smaller, the nonzero values of the signal s (t) pTs (t) will simply
be s (nTs), the signal’s samples. If indeed the Nyquist frequency equals the signal’s highest frequency, at
least two samples will occur within the period of the signal’s highest frequency sinusoid. In these ways, the
sampling signal captures the sampled signal’s temporal variations in a way that leaves all the original signal’s
structure intact.
