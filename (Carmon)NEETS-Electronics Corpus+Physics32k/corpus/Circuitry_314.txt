Figure  6.21  shows  an  improved  power  supply  in 
which  a  transistor  is  used  to  provide  current  gain 
and  minimize  the  power  dissipated  in  the  zener 
diode  (TR1  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  a  series-
pass  transistor).  The  zener  diode,  D5,  is  rated  at 
13 V and the output voltage will be approximately 
0.7  V  less  than  this  (i.e.  13  V  minus  the  base-
emitter  voltage  drop  associated  with  TR1).  Hence 
the  output  voltage  is  about  12.3  V.  The  circuit  is
