Light Adaptation
The human visual system (HVS) has two major classes of photoreceptors, the rods and the cones. Because these
two  types  of  receptors  adapt  to  light  differently,  two  different  adaptation  time  constants  exist.  Furthermore,
these receptors respond at different rates going from dark to light than from light to dark. It should also be
noted that although the HVS has an ability to adapt to an enormous range of light intensity levels, on the order
of 1010 in millilamberts, it does so adaptively. The simultaneous range is on the order of 103.
