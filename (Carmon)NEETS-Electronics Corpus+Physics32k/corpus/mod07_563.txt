However, when you look at the scope pattern for point 6 (the voltage at the rectifier cathodes), you 
see the waveshape for pulsating direct current. This pulsating dc is fed through the first choke (L1) and 
filter capacitor (C1) which remove a large part of the ripple, or "hum," as shown by the waveform for 
point 7. Finally the dc voltage is fed through the second choke (L2) and filter capacitor (C2), which
