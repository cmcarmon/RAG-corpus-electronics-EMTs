Some operating systems such as UNIX and MS-DOS pro-
vide a special ﬁle abstraction to allow users to perform I/O
without knowing all details of the hardware. Special ﬁles can be
read and written in the same way as regular ﬁles are read and
written. Special ﬁles are categorized into two types: block
special ﬁles and character special ﬁles. Block special ﬁles are
used to model devices that consist of a collection of randomly
addressable blocks, such as disks. By opening a block special
ﬁle and reading, a program can directly access the desired
block on the device without regard to the structure of the ﬁle
system contained on it.
