The small size of the resistor prevents printing the re‑
sistance value and tolerance on its case. Therefore, a 
color‑coded strip system is used to display the resistor 
value. The strips can be seen and read in any position 
that the resistor is placed. The Electronic Industries 
Association (EIA) color code is shown in Figure 13‑12.
The meaning of the colored bands on a resistor is as 
follows. The first band, closest to the end of the resis‑
tor, represents the first digit of the resistor value. The 
second band represents the second digit of the resistor 
value. The third band represents the number of zeros 
to be added to the first two digits. The fourth band 
represents the tolerance of the resistor (Figure 13‑13).
For example, the resistor shown in Figure 13‑14 has 
a resistance value of 1500 ohms. The brown band (first
