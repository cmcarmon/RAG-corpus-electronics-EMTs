Just as the pumping of water to a higher level results in energy being stored, ”pumping”
electrons to create an electric charge imbalance results in a certain amount of energy being
stored in that imbalance. And, just as providing a way for water to ﬂow back down from the
heights of the reservoir results in a release of that stored energy, providing a way for electrons
to ﬂow back to their original ”levels” results in a release of stored energy.
