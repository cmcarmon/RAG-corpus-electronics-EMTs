Elliptical geosynchronous orbits are used in communications satellites to keep the satellite in view of its assigned ground stations and receivers. A satellite in an elliptical geosynchronous orbit appears to oscillate in the sky from the viewpoint of a ground station, tracing an analemma in the sky. Satellites in highly elliptical orbits must be tracked by steerable ground stations.
The Infrared Space Observatory was in a highly elliptical geosynchronous orbit with an orbital height of apogee 70,600 km and perigee 1,000 km. It was controlled by two ground stations.
NAVIC is a regional — i.e. non-global — Indian navigation system currently operating with 7 satellites, of which 3 are in geostationary orbit and 4 in geosynchronous orbit.
The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a three-satellite regional time transfer system and enhancement for GPS, covering Japan at high elevation from a Tundra orbit.
An active geosynchronous orbit is a hypothetical orbit that could be maintained if forces other than gravity were also used, such as a solar sail. Such a statite could be geosynchronous in an orbit different (higher, lower, more or less elliptical, or some other path) from the conic section orbit dictated by the laws of gravity.
A further form of geosynchronous orbit is proposed for the theoretical space elevator, in which one end of the structure is tethered to the ground, maintaining a shorter orbital period than by gravity alone if under tension.
Other related orbit types are:
Supersynchronous orbit: a disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites drift in a westerly direction.
Subsynchronous orbit: a drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Used for satellites undergoing station changes in an eastern direction.
Graveyard orbit: a supersynchronous orbit where spacecraft are intentionally placed at the end of their operational life.
