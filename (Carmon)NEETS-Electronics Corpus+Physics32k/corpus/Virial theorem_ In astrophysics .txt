The virial theorem is frequently applied in astrophysics, especially relating the gravitational potential energy of a system to its kinetic or thermal energy. Some common virial relations are,

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{5}}{\frac {GM}{R}}={\frac {3}{2}}{\frac {k_{B}T}{m_{p}}}={\frac {1}{2}}v^{2},}

for a mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
, radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
, velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
, and temperature



T


{\displaystyle T}
. The constants are Newton's constant



G


{\displaystyle G}
, the Boltzmann constant




k

B




{\displaystyle k_{B}}
, and proton mass




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
. Note that these relations are only approximate, and often the leading numerical factors (e.g. 3/5 or 1/2) are neglected entirely.
