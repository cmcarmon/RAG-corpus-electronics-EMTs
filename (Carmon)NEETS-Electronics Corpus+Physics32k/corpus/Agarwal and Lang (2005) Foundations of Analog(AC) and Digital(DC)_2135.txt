In all preceding Op Amp calculations, we have made an approximation that
because the so-called loop gain in the denominator is much bigger than one, the
‘‘one’’ term can be neglected. This approximation is almost always valid in Op
Amp calculations. It is the factor 1+ (loop gain) that determines how insensitive
the circuit is to changes in the Op Amp gain constant A (see Equation 15.17,
for example), hence large loop gain is clearly a desirable design goal. If the loop
gain is almost always going to be large, it seems a bit clumsy (although clearly
correct) to make the circuit calculations without taking this fact into account
until the last line. One would hope that with some hindsight, it might be possible
to make the ‘‘large loop gain’’ assumption at the start of the circuit calculation,
thereby simplifying the math. Let us re-examine the circuit of Figure 15.8b with
this in mind.
