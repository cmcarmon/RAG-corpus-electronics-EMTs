Recording
Recording  of  the  image  at  the  receiver  is  effected  by  applying  electricity,  heat,  light,  ink  jet,  or  pressure  to  a
recording  medium  [Stamps,  1982].  Xerography  or  ink  jet  techniques  can  be  used  to  record  on  plain  paper.
Other recording means using electricity, heat, or pressure require specially coated papers. Except for the ink
jet, recording processes requiring only a one-step process utilize specially coated papers. Marking transducers
are used to apply the image to the recording medium.
