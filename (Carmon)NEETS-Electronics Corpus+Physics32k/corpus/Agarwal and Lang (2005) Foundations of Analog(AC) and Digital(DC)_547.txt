Figure 3.90a. This is a bridge circuit, often used in the laboratory to measure values
of unknown resistors by comparing against known standard resistors. We want to find
the voltage across R5, and then find the condition on the other resistor values that will
make this voltage zero. Direct application of nodal analysis is quite messy, so we will
seek an alternative method.
