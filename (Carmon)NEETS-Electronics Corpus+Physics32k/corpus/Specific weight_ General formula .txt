g


{\displaystyle \gamma =\rho \,g}

where




γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the specific weight of the material (weight per unit volume, typically N/m3 units)




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the material (mass per unit volume, typically kg/m3)




g


{\displaystyle g}
is acceleration due to gravity (rate of change of velocity, given in m/s2, and on Earth usually given as 9.81 m/s2)
