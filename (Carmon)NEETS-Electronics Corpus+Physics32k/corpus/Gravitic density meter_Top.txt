A Gravitic density meter is a type of density meter used in multiple industries to measure the density of a slurry flowing through a pipe line. It consists of a flexible rubber hose that deflects when weight is flowing through the hose. A displacement measurement device, usually a high precision laser or load cell, is used to measure how much change has occurred in the system. By calculating the change of deflection of the hose, a gravitic density meter can be used to find the real time, continuous density.
Gravitic density meters do not measure the specific gravity directly. The specific gravity is calculated after the density has been measured.
