The self-inductance for coil 2 and the mutual inductance L12
can also be computed using equation 1.96. A current I2 is
assumed to exist in coil 2 for the purposes of these inductance
calculations. Since the inductance of inductors formed from
linear materials does not depend on the current in the wire,
assuming this current I2 is only a construction step. From
equation 1.96:
