Turning three NAND gates into an OR gate
You can combine several NAND gates to create any other logical function. In 
the circuit in Figure 11-10, three NAND gates are combined to create an OR 
gate. The inputs to the OR gate are controlled by switches SW3 and SW4. The 
output of the OR gate is indicated by the on/off state of the LED.
