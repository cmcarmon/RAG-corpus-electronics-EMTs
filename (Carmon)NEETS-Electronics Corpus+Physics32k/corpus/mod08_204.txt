The use of a peaking coil in series with the output signal path is known as SERIES PEAKING.
Figure 2-6 shows a transistor amplifier circuit with a series peaking coil. In this figure, R1 is the
input-signal-developing resistor. R2 is used for bias and temperature stability of Q1. C1 is the bypass
capacitor for R2. R3 is the load resistor for Q1 and develops the output signal. C2 is the coupling
capacitor which couples the output signal to the next stage. "Phantom" capacitor COUT represents the
output capacitance of the circuit, and "phantom" capacitor CIN represents the input capacitance of the next
stage.
