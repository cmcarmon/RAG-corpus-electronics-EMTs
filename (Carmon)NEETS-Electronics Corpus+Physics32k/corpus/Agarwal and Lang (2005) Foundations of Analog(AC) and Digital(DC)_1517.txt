In practice, capacitors will leak their charge over time due to parasitic
resistances. Let us suppose the capacitor gradually discharges through a parasitic
resistance RP (see Figure 10.60). In this situation, for how long will the value
stored in the capacitor remain valid after the store signal is de-asserted?
