It is possible to provide an alternative approach to clock
skew scheduling that considers all permissible ranges and also
provides a natural quantitative measure of the quality of a
particular clock schedule. Consider, for instance, a circuit
with a target clock period TCP. Furthermore, denote an object-
ive clock skew value for a local data path Ri?Rj by gi, j, where
it is required that li, j  gi, j  ui, j (recall the lower equation
4.10 and upper equation 4.11 bounds of the permissible
range). For most practical circuits, it is unlikely that a feasible
clock schedule can be computed that is exactly equal to the
objective clock schedule for each local data path. Multiple
linear dependencies among clock skews
in each circuit
exist—those linear dependencies deﬁne a solution space such
that the clock schedule s ¼ gi1, j1
most likely is
not within this solution space (unless the circuit is constructed
of only nonrecursive feed-forward paths). If tcd is a feasible
clock schedule, however, it is possible to evaluate how close a
