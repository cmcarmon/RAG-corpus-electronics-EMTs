A/D Converter ICs
A/D converter ICs can be classiﬁed as general-purpose, high-speed, ﬂash, and sampling A/D converters. The

to 33 ms. A/D conversion techniques used by these devices typically include successive approximation, tracking,
and integrating. The general-purpose A/D converters often have control signals for simpliﬁed microprocessor
interfacing. These ICs are appropriate for many process control, industrial, and instrumentation applications,
as well as for environmental monitoring such as seismology, oceanography, meteorology, and pollution monitoring.
