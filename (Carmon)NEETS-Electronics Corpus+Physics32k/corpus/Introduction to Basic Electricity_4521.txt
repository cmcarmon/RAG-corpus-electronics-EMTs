Shift registers are often used for temporary stor-
age. They are capable of storing one or more binary 
words. There are three requirements for this applica-
tion of a shift register: First, it must be able to accept 
and store data. Second, it must be able to retrieve or 
read out the data on command. Third, when the data 
are read, they must not be lost. Figure 44-28 shows the 
external circuitry required to enable a shift register to 
read and maintain the data stored in it. The read/write 
line, when high, allows new data to be stored in the 
shift register. Once the data are stored, the read/write 
line goes low, enabling gate 2, which allows the data to 
recirculate while reading out the data.
