The measurement of molar mass by vapour density relies on the principle, first enunciated by Amedeo Avogadro, that equal volumes of gases under identical conditions contain equal numbers of particles. This principle is included in the ideal gas equation:




p
V
=
n
R
T



{\displaystyle pV=nRT\ }

where n is the amount of substance. The vapour density (ρ) is given by




ρ
=



n
M


V



.



{\displaystyle \rho ={{nM} \over {V}}.\ }

Combining these two equations gives an expression for the molar mass in terms of the vapour density for conditions of known pressure and temperature.




M
=



R
T
ρ


p






{\displaystyle M={{RT\rho } \over {p}}\ }
