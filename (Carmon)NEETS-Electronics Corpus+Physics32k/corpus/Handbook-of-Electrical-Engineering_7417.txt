One of the limitations to accuracy and repeatability in telemetry is the output level of the transducer. The
low  electrical  levels  produced  by  thermocouples  and  strain  gauges  (0.010 V)  are  more  difﬁcult  to  telemeter
than high-voltage levels of 5 V. At low signal levels, extraneous electrical noises produce greater degradation.
These may be thermally generated or caused by atmospheric effects or generated by nearby electrical equipment.
When  low-level  transducers  are  used,  stable  ampliﬁers  are  required  to  raise  their  signal  voltage  to  useful
modulation levels.
