Tropospheric scatter propagation is used for point-to-point communications. A correctly designed 
tropospheric scatter circuit will provide highly reliable service for distances ranging from 50 miles to 500 
miles. Tropospheric scatter systems may be particularly useful for communications to locations in rugged 
terrain that are difficult to reach with other methods of propagation. One reason for this is that the 
tropospheric scatter circuit is not affected by ionospheric and auroral disturbances.
