It is often more economical to transfer energy between two
circuits of similar voltage using an autotransformer rather than
a conventional two-winding transformer. Figure 3.3 provides
an illustration of this arrangement. Most autotransformers are
Y-connected with a delta tertiary (used to provide a path for
third harmonic currents required for excitation). The auto-
transformer does not afford electrical separation between the
two circuits but is a more economical transformer on a $/kVA
basis. In addition, the autotransformer is not inherently self-
protecting and typically will be subjected to higher short
circuit currents and forces than a corresponding two-winding
transformer. The autotransformer can also be used to increase
or decrease voltage in a system. By using suitable on-load tap-
changing equipment, it is possible to regulate the voltage of a
system within desired limits. An autotransformer used in this
manner is referred to as a voltage-regulating transformer. Typ-
ically, the range of the regulation is 10% of the system voltage
in 5/8% steps.
