The Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism is a four-bar mechanism that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion with approximate constant velocity. The precise design trades off straightness, lack of acceleration, and the proportion of the driving rotation that is spent in the linear portion of the full curve.
The example to the right spends over half of the cycle in the near straight portion.
The Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism is a cognate linkage of the Chebyshev linkage.
The linkage was first shown in Paris on the Exposition Universelle (1878) as "The Plantigrade Machine".
The Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism looks like the Greek letter lambda, therefore the linkage is also known as Lambda Mechanism.
