system for real-time differential GPS (DGPS) positioning will deliver submeter accuracy to Earth
satellites and ground-based users worldwide. Developed at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsions Laboratory,
the system could improve real-time position accuracy to a few decimeters for single-frequency
users  and  10  cm  or  better  for  dual  frequency  users.  In  addition  to  high  accuracy,  the  system  provides
nearly complete separation of GPS orbit and clock corrections and continuous determination of inter-
frequency delay biases for all GPS satellites and reference receivers.
