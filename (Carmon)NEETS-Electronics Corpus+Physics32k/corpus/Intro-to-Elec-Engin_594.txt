The future scope of the Internet, along with the World Wide Web (born in 1990), and the
commercialization of the Internet are bound to grow exponentially. In 1991, the U.S. Congress
passed the High Performance Computing Act to establish the National Research and Education
Network (NREN), which allows the electronic transfer of the entire Encyclopedia Britannica in
one second. Computer networks worldwide will feature 3–D animated graphics, radio and cellular
phone-links to portable computers, as well as fax, voice, and high-deﬁnition television. While the
Web is fast becoming a part of our everyday lives, the real Internet of the future may bear very
little resemblance to today’s plans.
