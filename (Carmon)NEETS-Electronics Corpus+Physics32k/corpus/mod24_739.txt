The gain of the APD can be changed by changing the reverse-bias voltage. A larger reverse-bias
voltage results in a larger gain. However, a larger reverse-bias voltage also results in increased noise
levels. Excess noise resulting from the avalanche multiplication process places a limit on the useful gain
of the APD. The avalanche process introduces excess noise because every photogenerated carrier does not
undergo the same multiplication. The noise properties of an APD are affected by the materials that the
