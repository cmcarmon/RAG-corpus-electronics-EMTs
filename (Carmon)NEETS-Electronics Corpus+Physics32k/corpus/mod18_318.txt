Tr tubes used at microwave frequencies are built to fit into, and become a part of, a resonant cavity.
You may increase the speed with which the gap breaks down after the transmitter fires by placing a
voltage across the gap electrodes. This potential is known as KEEP-ALIVE VOLTAGE and ranges from
100 volts to 1,000 volts. A glow discharge is maintained between the electrodes. (The term GLOW
DISCHARGE refers to the discharge of electricity through a gas-filled electron tube. This is distinguished
by a cathode glow and voltage drop much higher than the gas-ionization voltage in the cathode vicinity.)
This action provides for rapid ionization when the transmitter pulse arrives.
