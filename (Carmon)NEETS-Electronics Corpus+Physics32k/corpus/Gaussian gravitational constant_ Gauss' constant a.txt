The Gaussian constant is closely related to Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and one is easily derived from the other. Beginning with the full definition of Gauss' constant,

p





,


{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi ab}{P{\sqrt {M+m}}{\sqrt {p}}}},}

where
a is the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit,
b is the semi-minor axis of the elliptical orbit,
P is the orbital period,
M is the mass of the primary body,
m is the mass of the secondary body, and
p is the semi-latus rectum of the elliptical orbit.
From the geometry of an ellipse, the semi-latus rectum, p can be expressed in terms of a and b thus: p = b2/a.   Therefore,






p


=

a



.


{\displaystyle {\sqrt {p}}={\frac {b}{\sqrt {a}}}.}

Substituting and reducing, Gauss' constant becomes




k

{\displaystyle k={\frac {2\pi }{P}}{\sqrt {\frac {a^{3}}{M+m}}}.}

From orbital mechanics, 2π/P is just n, the mean motion of the body in its orbit. Hence,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}k&=n{\sqrt {\frac {a^{3}}{M+m}}},\\[8pt]k^{2}&={\frac {n^{2}a^{3}}{M+m}},\\[8pt]k^{2}(M+m)&=n^{2}a^{3},\end{aligned}}}

which is the definition of Kepler's third law. In this form, it is often seen with G, the Newtonian gravitational constant in place of k2.
Setting a = 1, M = 1, m ≪ M, and n in radians per day results in k ≈ n, also in units of radians per day, about which see the relevant section of the mean motion article.
