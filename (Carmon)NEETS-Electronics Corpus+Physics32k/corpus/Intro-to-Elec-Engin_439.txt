As with all electronic circuits, op amps have limited frequency response. Because of the negative
feedback of the circuit, the passband of an op-amp circuit is usually much larger than that of the
op amp by itself. Typically with a given op amp, increasing the bandwidth of an op-amp circuit
will decrease the voltage gain in the same proportion. Thus for a given op amp, the product of gain
and bandwidth (i.e., the gainâ€“bandwidth product) is a constant, as discussed earlier and shown in
Figure 5.2.4.
