Measurements on CRTs
Line Width and Modulation Transfer Function
The  emitted  phosphor  spot  of  a  CRT  usually  presents  a  Gaussian  energy  distribution.  The  measurement  is
usually performed at the 50% height of the Gaussian curve and is called L0.5. It can be done also at the s point
of the Gaussian curve and called L0.6, with L0.5 = 1.175 L0.6 = 1.175 Ls.
