Reactive near ﬁeld: The region close to an antenna where the reactive components of the electromagnetic
ﬁelds from charges on the antenna structure are very large compared to the radiating ﬁelds. Considered
negligible at distances greater than a wavelength from the source (decay as the square or cube of distance).
Reactive ﬁeld is important at antenna edges and for electrically small antennas.
