A linear bus topology consists of a single transmission line that is shared by a number of
equipments (see figure 8-2). Generally the transmission line in a fiber optic linear bus consists of two
optical lines, one for each direction of communication. Optical taps (optical splitters) are used by each
equipment to connect to each line. For each line, the optical tap couples signals from the line to the
equipment receiver and from the equipment transmitter onto the line. The connection between any two
equipments is a simple point-to-point link that contains the optical tap for each equipment.
