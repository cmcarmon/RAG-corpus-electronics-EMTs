To find the relation between vo and vi in the presence of the capacitor, we first
draw the impedance model of the circuit as shown in Figure 13.21a, and replace
the load resistance RL with the effective load impedance ZL in the computation
of the amplifier response. As illustrated in Figure 13.21b, the load impedance
ZL is given by
