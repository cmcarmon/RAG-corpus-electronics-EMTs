The regions outside of the (effective) internal transistor are
usually described by lumped elements, which will be discussed
brieï¬‚y (see Figures 5.5 and 5.9). For dc operation, the series
resistances of the emitter (rE) as well as of the external base
(rBx) and collector (rCx) have to be taken into account besides
possible current components across the junctions (such as
ijBCx); rCx results from the buried layer and sinker; advanced
bipolar transistors rBx is dominated by the component under
the BE spacer (refer to blow-up in Figure 5.5).
