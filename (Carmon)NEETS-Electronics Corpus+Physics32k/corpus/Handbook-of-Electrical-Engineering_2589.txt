The silicon-based MOSFET has been successful primarily because the siliconâ€“silicon dioxide system provides
a  stable  interface  with  low  trap  densities,  and  because  the  oxide  is  impermeable  to  many  environmental
contaminants, has a high breakdown strength, and is easy to grow uniformly and reproducibly [Nicollian and
Brews, 1982]. These attributes allow easy fabrication using lithographic processes, resulting in integrated circuits
(ICs),  with  very  small  devices,  very  large  device  counts,  and  very  high  reliability  at  low  cost.  Because  the
importance of the MOSFET lies in this relationship to high-density manufacture, an emphasis of this article
is to describe the issues involved in continuing miniaturization.
