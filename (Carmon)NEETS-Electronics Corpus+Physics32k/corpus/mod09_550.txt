At T0 the input voltage is −50 volts and the capacitor begins charging. At the first instant the voltage 
across C is 0 and the voltage across R is −50 volts. As C charges, its voltage increases. The voltage across 
R, which is the output voltage, begins to drop as the voltage across C increases. At T1 the capacitor has 
charged to 20 percent of the −50 volts input, or −10 volts. Because the input voltage is now 0 volts, the 
capacitor must discharge. It discharges through the low impedance of the signal source and through R, 
developing +10 volts across R at the first instant. C discharges 20 percent of the original 10-volt charge 
from T1 to T2. Thus, C discharges to +8 volts and the output voltage also drops to 8 volts.
