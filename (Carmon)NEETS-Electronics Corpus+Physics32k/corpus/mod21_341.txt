A dB meter is a form of ac electronic voltmeter calibrated in dB's. These meters are useful for 
making measurements where direct indication in decibels is desired. However, remember that these are 
voltmeters, and power measurements are not meaningful unless the circuit impedance is known. When the 
dB meter is calibrated, a reference point, based on a specific power or value of voltage across a specified 
resistance, is selected to represent 0 dB. Many electronic voltmeters use a single dB scale based on 1 
milliwatt into a 600-ohm load to represent 0 dBm. Based on this reference point, various voltage readings 
could be made on the low ac-voltage scale. The +dB numbers corresponding to voltage ratios that exist 
between successive ranges and the low ac range have been computed for each range. These numbers, 
shown on the front panel of the instrument, are added algebraically to each successive range reading to 
produce the correct value for the range. The term decibel does not, in itself, indicate power. It indicates a 
ratio or comparison between two power levels that permits you to calculate the power. Often, it is more 
desirable to express performance measurements in terms of decibels using a fixed power level as a 
reference. The original standard reference level was 6 milliwatts, but to simplify calculations a standard 
reference level of 1 milliwatt has been adopted.
