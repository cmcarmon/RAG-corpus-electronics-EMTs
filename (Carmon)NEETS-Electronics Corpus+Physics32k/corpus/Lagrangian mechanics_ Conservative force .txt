A particle of mass m moves under the influence of a conservative force derived from the gradient ∇ of a scalar potential,





F

=
−
∇
V
(

r

)

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-\nabla V(\mathbf {r} )\,.}

If there are more particles, in accordance with the above results, the total kinetic energy is a sum over all the particle kinetic energies, and the potential is a function of all the coordinates.
