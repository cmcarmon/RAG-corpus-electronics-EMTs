New teleparallel gravity theory (or new general relativity) is a theory of gravitation on Weitzenböck spacetime, and attributes gravitation to the torsion tensor formed of the parallel vector fields.
In the new teleparallel gravity theory the fundamental assumptions are as follows:

In 1961 Christian Møller revived Einstein’s idea, and Pellegrini and Plebanski found a Lagrangian formulation for absolute parallelism.
