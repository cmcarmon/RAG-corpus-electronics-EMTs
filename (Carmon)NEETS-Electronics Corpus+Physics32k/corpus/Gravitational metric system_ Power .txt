In 19th-century France there was as a unit of power, the poncelet, which was defined as the power required to raise a mass of 1 quintal (1 q = 100 kg) at a velocity of 1 m/s. The German or metric horsepower (PS, Pferdestärke) is arbitrarily selected to be three quarters thereof.
1 pq
= 1 qf⋅m/s = 100 kp⋅m/s = 100 × gn kg⋅m/s = 980.665 kg⋅m2/s3 = 0.980 665 kW
1 PS
= 3/4 pq = 75 kp⋅m/s = 75 × gn kg⋅m/s = 735.498 75 kg⋅m2/s3 = 0.735 498 75 kW
