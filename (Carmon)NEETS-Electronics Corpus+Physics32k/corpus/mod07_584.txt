A SERIES REGULATOR uses a variable resistance in series with the load. Regulation is achieved 
by varying this resistance either to increase or to decrease the voltage drop across the resistive element of 
the regulator. Characteristically, the resistance of the variable resistance moves in the same direction as 
the load. When the resistance of the load increases, the variable resistance of the regulator increases; 
when load resistance decreases, the variable resistance of the regulator decreases.
