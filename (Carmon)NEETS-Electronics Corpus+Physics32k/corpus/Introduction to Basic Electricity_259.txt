Reverse	engineering,	also	called	deconstruction,	reversing,	backwards
engineering,	and	back	engineering	is	the	process	of	extracting	knowledge	from
any	device	or	electronic	equipment.	It	involves	the	need	to	deconstruct	an	entire
circuit	for	further	analysis	of	its	components.	Although	the	methods	that	will	be
employed	are	opposite	to	the	process	of	creation,	it	is	considered	as	a	practical
approach	of	learning	circuitry.
Moreover,	reverse	engineering	gives	light	to	Aristotle’s	concept	that	the	key	to
understanding	the	operations	of	a	device	is	studying	each	one	of	its	parts.	Back	in
the	days,	the	field	is	limited	to	its	employment	on	a	circuit	and	other	electronic
equipment;	now,	in	the	modern	world,	the	application	of	a	“reverse”	methodology
includes	almost	anything	–	from	children’s	toys	and	household	appliances	to
neuroscience,	computer	programming,	and	DNA.
