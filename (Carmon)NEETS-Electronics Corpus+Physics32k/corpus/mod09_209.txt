Another type of sine-wave generator uses inductors and capacitors for its frequency-determining 
network. This type is known as the LC OSCILLATOR. LC oscillators, which use tank circuits, are 
commonly used for the higher radio frequencies. They are not suitable for use as extremely low-frequency 
oscillators because the inductors and capacitors would be large in size, heavy, and costly to manufacture.
