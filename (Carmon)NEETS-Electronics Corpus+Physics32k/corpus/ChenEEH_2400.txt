The parameter Zr , is called the radiation efﬁciency. A part of
the Ploss is dissipated as dielectric loss (Pld), a part as conductor
loss (Plc), and a part is sometimes lost as unwanted surface
wave in the antenna substrate material (Psw ), with efﬁciencies
associated with the individual loss mechanisms as Zd, Zc, and
Zsw , respectively:
