Polarization Mode Dispersion
The  HE11 propagating in a single mode ﬁber actually consists of two orthogonally polarized modes, but the
two  modes  have  the  same  effective  refractive  index  and  propagation  velocity  except  in  birefringent  ﬁbers.
Birefringent ﬁbers have asymmetric cores or asymmetric refractive index distribution in the core, which result
in different refractive indices and group velocities for the orthogonally polarized modes. The different group
velocities result in a group delay of one mode relative to the other, known as polarization mode dispersion.
Birefringent  ﬁbers  are  polarization  preserving  and  are  required  for  several  applications,  including  coherent
optical  detection  and  ﬁber  optic  gyroscopes.  In  high  birefringence  ﬁbers,  polarization  dispersion  can  exceed
1 ns/km. However, in low birefringence ﬁbers, polarization mode dispersion is negligible relative to other pulse
spreading mechanisms [Payne et al., 1982].
