Usually, wire resistance is very small (only a few ohms per hundreds of feet, depending
primarily on the gauge (size) of the wire), but if the connecting wires are very long, and/or the
component to be measured has a very low resistance anyway, the measurement error intro-
duced by wire resistance will be substantial.
