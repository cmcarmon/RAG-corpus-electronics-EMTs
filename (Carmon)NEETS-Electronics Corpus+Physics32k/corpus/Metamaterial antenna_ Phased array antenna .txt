Patented in 2004, one phased array antenna system is useful in automotive radar applications. By using NIMs as a biconcave lens to focus microwaves, the antenna's sidelobes are reduced in size. This equates to a reduction in radiated energy loss, and a relatively wider useful bandwidth. The system is an efficient, dynamically-ranged phased array radar system.
In addition, signal amplitude is increased across the microstrip transmission lines by suspending them above the ground plane at a predetermined distance. In other words, they are not in contact with a solid substrate. Dielectric signal loss is reduced significantly, reducing signal attenuation.
This system was designed to boost the performance of the Monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), among other benefits. A transmission line is created with photolithography. A metamaterial lens, consisting of a thin wire array focuses the transmitted or received signals between the line and the emitter / receiver elements.
The lens also functions as an input device and consists of a number of periodic unit-cells disposed along the line. The lens consists of multiple lines of the same make up; a plurality of periodic unit-cells. The periodic unit-cells are constructed of a plurality of electrical components; capacitors and inductors as components of multiple distributed circuits.
The metamaterial incorporates a conducting transmission element, a substrate comprising at least a first ground plane for grounding the transmission element, a plurality of unit-cell circuits composed periodically along the transmission element and at least one via for electrically connecting the transmission element to at least the first ground plane. It also includes a means for suspending this transmission element a predetermined distance from the substrate in a way such that the transmission element is located at a second predetermined distance from the ground plane.
