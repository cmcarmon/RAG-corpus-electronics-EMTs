of  this  technique  is  the  Trimedia  TM-1  processor  [Rat96]  shown  in  Fig.  17.30.  This  machine  has  a  VLIW
processor.  It  also  has  several  function  units  for  specialized  video  operations,  principal  among  these  being  a
variable-length  decoding  for  channel  coding,  an  image  coprocessor.  The  TM-1  also  supports  multiple  DMA
channels to speed up data transfers as well as timers to support realtime operation.
