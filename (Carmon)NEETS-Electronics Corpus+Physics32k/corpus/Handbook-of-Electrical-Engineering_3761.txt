Propagation in the Atmosphere
Wave propagation hardly occurs under the idealized conditions assumed in the previous subsection. For most
communication links, the analysis must be modiÔ¨Åed to account for the presence of the earth, the ionosphere,
and atmospheric precipitates such as fog, raindrops, snow, and hail. This will be done in this subsection.
