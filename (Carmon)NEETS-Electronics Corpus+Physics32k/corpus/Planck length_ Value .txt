{\displaystyle \ell _{\mathrm {P} }={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar G}{c^{3}}}}}

Solving the above will show the approximate equivalent value of this unit with respect to the meter:

{\displaystyle 1\ \ell _{\mathrm {P} }\approx 1.616\;229(38)\times 10^{-35}\ \mathrm {m} }

where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light in a vacuum, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant. The two digits enclosed by parentheses are the estimated standard error associated with the reported numerical value.
The Planck length is about 10−20 times the diameter of a proton. It can be defined using the radius of Planck particle.
