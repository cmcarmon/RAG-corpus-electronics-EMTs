Rayleigh Scattering
Rayleigh  scattering  is  caused  by  localized  variations  in  refractive  index  in  the  dielectric  medium,  which  are
small relative to the optic wavelength. It is strong in the ultraviolet region. It increases with decreasing wave-
length, being proportional to l– 4. It contributes a loss factor of exp(–aR z). The Rayleigh scattering coefﬁcient,
aR , is given by
