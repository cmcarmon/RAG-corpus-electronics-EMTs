In  high-energy  physics,  the  use  of  various  strip,  drift,  and  pixellated  detectors  for  tracking  and  vertex
determination has ï¬‚ourished. These efforts will intensify as experimental requirements for spatial resolution
increase. However, radiation damage to the detector is already an issue in this application, and higher luminosity
beams  will  only  increase  the  problem.  Nevertheless,  it  appears  that  the  continuing  need  of  the  high-energy
physics community for a higher number and density of signal paths forecasts continued reliance on the ever-
improving integration technology of the semiconductor silicon industry.
