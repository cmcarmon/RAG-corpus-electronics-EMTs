Frequency Translation and Product Modulation
The basic operation needed to build modulators is the multiplication of two signals. Whenever
sinusoids are multiplied, frequency translation takes place. Figure 14.2.1(a) shows a product
modulator, which multiplies the signal x(t) and a sinusoidal carrier wave at frequency fc to yield
