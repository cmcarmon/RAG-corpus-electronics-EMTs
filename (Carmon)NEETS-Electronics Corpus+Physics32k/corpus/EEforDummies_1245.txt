By adjusting the two potentiometers, R2 and R4, you change the pitch and 
speed of the siren. You can produce all sorts of siren and other weird sound 
effects by adjusting these two potentiometers. You can operate this circuit at 
any voltage between 5 V and about 15 V. To power the gadget, use an easy‐to‐
find 9 V battery (included in the parts list in the preceding section).
