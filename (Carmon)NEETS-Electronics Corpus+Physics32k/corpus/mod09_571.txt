By comparing the input and output wave shapes, you should note the following: (1) The peak-to-
peak amplitude of the input wave shape has not been changed in the output (for all practical purposes) by 
the action of the clamper circuit; (2) the shape of the input wave has not been changed; (3) the output 
wave shape is now clamped above +10 volts. Remember that this clamping level (+10 volts) is 
determined by the bias battery.
