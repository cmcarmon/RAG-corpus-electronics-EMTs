2.25°C/W,  determine  the  total  thermal  resistance 
that exists between junction and ambient. 
 
Applying equation (5) gives: 
 
(cid:4)JA =(cid:4)JC + (cid:4)CS + (cid:4)SA = 1.5 + 1.75 + 2.25 = 5.5°C/W 
 
Worst case conditions 
 
In the design of electronic equipment we often need 
to plan for the worst case conditions, ensuring that
