When amount of substance enters into a derived quantity, it is usually as the denominator: such quantities are known as molar quantities. For example, the quantity which describes the volume occupied by a given amount of substance is called the molar volume, while the quantity which describes the mass of a given amount of substance is the molar mass. Molar quantities are sometimes denoted by a subscript Latin "m" in the symbol, e.g. Cp,m, molar heat capacity at constant pressure: the subscript may be omitted if there is no risk of ambiguity, as is often the case in pure chemistry.
The main derived quantity in which amount of substance enters into the numerator is amount of substance concentration, c. This name is often abbreviated to amount concentration, except in clinical chemistry where substance concentration is the preferred term to avoid ambiguity with mass concentration. The term molar concentration is incorrect, but commonly used.
