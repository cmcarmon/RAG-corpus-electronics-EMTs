Compensation for Camera and Background Movement
The motion content in a video sequence is the result of either
camera motion (e.g., pan, zoom, or tilt) or object and back-
ground motion. Panning motion of a camera is deﬁned as
rotation along the horizontal axis, whereas tilt is rotation
along the vertical axis. The major concern in motion
content-based video indexing and retrieval is almost always
the object’s motion and not the camera effects. This is because
while querying video indexing and retrieval systems, users tend
to be more interested in the maneuvering of the objects in the
scene and not the way camera is being tilted, rotated, or
zoomed with respect to the object. The problem is that the
true motion of the object cannot be assessed unless the camera
motion is compensated for. This problem always arises in case
of a video of a moving object recorded with a mobile camera.
Similarly, quite often there is object motion as well as back-
ground movement in the video sequence. In such cases,
background movement needs to be differentiated from object
movement to give the true object motion. Once these motions
have been separated, the object trajectory can be obtained and
video data can be indexed based on this motion cue along with
other features.
