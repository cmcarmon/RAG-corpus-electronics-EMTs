the accuracy of the meter. The input is amplified and applied directly to the meter. To perform the
measurement as shown in figure 4-4, you move the detector along the slotted line so that its probe is at a
voltage maximum and adjust the gain of the meter with the RANGE-DB, GAIN, and VERNIER controls
(EXPAND switch to NORM) for full-scale deflection (1.0 on the 1.0 to 4 SWR scale). Then move the
probe toward a minimum. If the meter drops below 3.2, rotate the RANGE-DB switch one position
clockwise and read on the 3.2 to 10 SWR scale. If the pointer drops below this scale, rotate the RANGE-
DB switch one more position clockwise and read on the 1.0 to 4 scale and multiply by 10. This pattern
continues for still higher swr readings.
