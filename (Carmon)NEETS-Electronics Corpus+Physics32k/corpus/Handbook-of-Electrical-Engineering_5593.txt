Distance Protection
As  the  power  networks  become  more  complex,  protection  with  directional  overcurrent  relays  becomes  even
more difﬁcult, if not impossible. Recall that the pickup setting of the relays must be set above the maximum
load which the line is expected to carry. However, a network system has so many probable conﬁgurations due
to various circuit breaker operations that the maximum load becomes difﬁcult to deﬁne. For the same reason,
the  minimum  fault  current—the  other  deﬁning  parameter  for  the  pickup  setting—also  becomes  uncertain.
Under these circumstances, the setting of the pickup of the overcurrent relays, and their reach, which will satisfy
all the constraints, becomes impossible. Distance relays solve this problem.
