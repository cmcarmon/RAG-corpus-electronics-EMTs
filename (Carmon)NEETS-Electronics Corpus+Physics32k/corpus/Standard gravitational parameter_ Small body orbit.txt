The central body in an orbital system can be defined as the one whose mass (M) is much larger than the mass of the orbiting body (m), or M ≫ m. This approximation is standard for planets orbiting the Sun or most moons and greatly simplifies equations. Under Newton's law of universal gravitation, if the distance between the bodies is r, the force exerted on the smaller body is:




F
=



G
M
m


r

=



μ
m


r

{\displaystyle F={\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}={\frac {\mu m}{r^{2}}}}

Thus only the product of G and M is needed to predict the motion of the smaller body. Conversely, measurements of the smaller body's orbit only provide information on the product, μ, not G and M separately. The gravitational constant, G, is difficult to measure with high accuracy, while orbits, at least in the solar system, can be measured with great precision and used to determine μ with similar precision.

{\displaystyle \mu =rv^{2}=r^{3}\omega ^{2}={\frac {4\pi ^{2}r^{3}}{T^{2}}}\ }

where r is the orbit radius, v is the orbital speed, ω is the angular speed, and T is the orbital period.
This can be generalized for elliptic orbits:

{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {4\pi ^{2}a^{3}}{T^{2}}}\ }

where a is the semi-major axis, which is Kepler's third law.
For parabolic trajectories rv2 is constant and equal to 2μ. For elliptic and hyperbolic orbits μ = 2a|ε|, where ε is the specific orbital energy.
