It should be remembered that adding the active ingredient to the electrolyte of a discharged battery 
does not recharge the battery. Adding the active ingredient only increases the specific gravity of the 
electrolyte and does not convert the plates back to active material, and so does not bring the battery back 
to a charged condition. A charging current must be passed through the battery to recharge it.
