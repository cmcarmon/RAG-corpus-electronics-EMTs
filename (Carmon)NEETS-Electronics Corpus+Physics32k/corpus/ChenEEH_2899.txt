Blind Speeds
It is noted that in Figure 10.5(C), the frequency responses have
nulls at multiples of the repetition frequency fR. This indicates
that Doppler frequencies equal to multiples of fR will subject to
total attenuation. Returns from targets with corresponding
velocities will be highly attenuated and cannot be detected by
the radar. These velocities are called blind speeds. The blind
