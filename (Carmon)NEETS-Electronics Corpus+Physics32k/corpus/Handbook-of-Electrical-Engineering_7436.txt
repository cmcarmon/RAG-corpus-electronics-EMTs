The main purposes of simulation are to help us understand the operation of a complex communication system,
to determine acceptable or optimum parameters for implementation of a system, and to determine the per-
formance  of  a  communication  system.  There  are  basically  two  types  of  systems  in  which  communication
engineers have interest:
