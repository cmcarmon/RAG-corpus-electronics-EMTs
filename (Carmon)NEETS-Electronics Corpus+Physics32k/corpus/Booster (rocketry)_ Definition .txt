A booster rocket or engine is either the first stage of a multistage rocket or launch vehicle, or else a shorter-burning rocket used in parallel with longer-burning sustainer rockets to augment a space vehicle's takeoff thrust and payload capability. The latter are frequently designated "zero stages".
Boosters are traditionally necessary to launch spacecraft into low Earth orbit absent a single-stage-to-orbit design, and are necessary to go beyond Earth orbit. When the boosterÂ´s fuel is empty it is dropped to fall back to Earth, a point known as booster engine cut-off (BECO). The rest of the launch vehicle continues to fly with its core or upper-stage engines. The booster may be recovered and reused, as in the case of the Space Shuttle.
