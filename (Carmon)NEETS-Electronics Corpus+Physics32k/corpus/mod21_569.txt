SWEPT-FREQUENCY TESTINGâ€”Testing the frequency response of a component or system
by applying an rf signal, in which the frequency is varied back and forth through a set
frequency range at a steady rate, to the input of a device. The output is then monitored to
determine the amplitude of the output with respect to frequency.
