A homothetic vector field (sometimes homothetic collineation or homothety) is a projective vector field which satisfies the condition:







L



X



g

a
b


=
2
c

g

a
b




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}g_{ab}=2cg_{ab}}

where c is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of singularities in general relativity. They can also be used to generate new solutions for Einstein equations by similarity reduction.
