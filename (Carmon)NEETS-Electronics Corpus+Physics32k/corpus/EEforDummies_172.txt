First, measure the voltage supplied to the circuit by the battery pack. 
Connect the positive (red) multimeter lead to the point where the positive 
(red lead) side of the battery pack connects to the resistor, and the negative 
(black) multimeter lead to the point where the negative (black lead) side of 
the battery pack connects to the LED. See Figure 3-10. Do you get a voltage 
reading that is close to the nominal supply voltage of 6 V? (Fresh batteries 
may supply more than 6 V; old batteries usually supply less than 6 V.)
