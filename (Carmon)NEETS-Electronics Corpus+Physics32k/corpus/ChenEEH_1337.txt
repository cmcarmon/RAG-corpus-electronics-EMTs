2. Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) machines
allow a single instruction stream to control many pro-
cessing elements in a lockstep fashion. Each processor
has its own data memory so that during each instruc-
tion step, many sets of data are processed simultan-
eously. Both vector processors, such as the CRAY T80,
and array processors, such as the Connection Machine
(Hillis, 1986), are SIMD machines.
