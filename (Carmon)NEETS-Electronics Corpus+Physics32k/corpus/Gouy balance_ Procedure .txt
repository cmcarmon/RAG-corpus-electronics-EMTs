The Gouy balance measures the apparent change in the mass of the sample as it is repelled or attracted by the region of high magnetic field between the poles. Some commercially available balances have a port at their base for this application. In use, a long, cylindrical sample to be tested is suspended from a balance, partially entering between the poles of a magnet. The sample can be in solid or liquid form, and is often placed in a cylindrical container such as a test tube. Solid compounds are generally ground into a fine powder to allow for uniformity amongst the sample. The sample is suspended between the magnetic poles through an attached thread or string. The experimental procedure requires two separate reading to be performed. An initial balance reading is performed on the sample of interest without a magnetic field (m a). A subsequent balance reading is taken with an applied magnetic field (mb). The difference between these two readings relates to the magnetic force on the sample (mb â€“ ma).
