Some engineers address the safety issue simply by making the outside case of the appliance
nonconductive. Such appliances are called double-insulated, since the insulating case serves
as a second layer of insulation above and beyond that of the conductors themselves. If a wire
inside the appliance accidently comes in contact with the case, there is no danger presented to
the user of the appliance.
