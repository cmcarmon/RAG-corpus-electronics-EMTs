Transverse waves cause the medium to vibrate at a right angle to the direction of the wave or energy being carried by the medium. Transverse waves have two partsâ€”the crest and the trough. The crest is the highest point of the wave and the trough is the lowest. The distance between a subsequent crest and a trough is half of wavelength. The wavelength is the distance from crest to crest or from trough to trough.
To see an example, move an end of a Slinky (whose other end is fixed) to the left-and-right of the Slinky, as opposed to to-and-fro. Light also has properties of a transverse wave, although it is an electromagnetic wave.
