The last band or VALENCE BAND is composed of a series of energy levels containing valence
electrons. Electrons in this band are more tightly bound to the individual atom than the electrons in the
conduction band. However, the electrons in the valence band can still be moved to the conduction band
with the application of energy, usually thermal energy. There are more bands below the valence band, but
they are not important to the understanding of semiconductor theory and will not be discussed.
