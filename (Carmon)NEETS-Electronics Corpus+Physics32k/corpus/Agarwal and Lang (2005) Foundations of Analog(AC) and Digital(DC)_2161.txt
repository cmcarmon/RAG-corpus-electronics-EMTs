Sample input and output waveforms for the differentiator are shown in
Figure 15.22. For the square-pulse input shown, the outputs are a pair of
spikes each at the time instant the input makes a transition. As illustrated in the
example, the differentiator circuit is often used in detecting shape transitions in
waveforms.
