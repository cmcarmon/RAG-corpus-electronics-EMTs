This is when one group or person delays another person. A good example is a vice president making a lower-ranked employee wait in his outer office while he conducts business. Another good example is a valued worker who always shows up late to work but this is allowed due to his abilities. This kind of encroachment is very common in the workplace. Various cultures look at this differentlyâ€”the Japanese are very punctual, while most Latin and Baltic cultures would be more relaxed with time, instead looking at social parameters.
