Alternating versus direct current 
 
Direct  currents  are  currents  which,  even  though 
their magnitude may vary, essentially flow only in 
one  direction.  In  other  words,  direct  currents  are 
unidirectional. Alternating  currents,  on  the  other 
hand,  are  bidirectional  and  continuously  reverse 
their  direction  of  flow.  The  polarity  of  the  e.m.f. 
which  produces  an  alternating  current  must 
consequently  also  be  changing  from  positive  to 
negative, and vice versa. 
  Alternating currents produce alternating potential 
differences (voltages) in the circuits in which they 
flow.  Furthermore,  in  some  circuits,  alternating 
voltages  may  be  superimposed  on  direct  voltage 
levels (see Fig. 4.1). The resulting voltage may be 
unipolar (i.e. always positive or always negative) or 
bipolar (i.e. partly positive and partly negative).
