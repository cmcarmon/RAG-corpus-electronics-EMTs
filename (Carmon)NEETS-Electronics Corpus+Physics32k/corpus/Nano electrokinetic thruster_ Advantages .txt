Nano electrokinetic thrusters have a very high efficiency, specific impulse, exhaust velocity and thrust-to-power ratio which make them suitable for a wide variety of applications. Due to the fact that a thruster is made up out of an array of multiple nano thrusters it is easily possible to design thursters in all sizes and thrust ranges. These properties give the nano electrokinetic thrusters very good thrust control which makes it applicable for a wide range of spacecraft ranging from maneuvering thrusters for small spacecraft, such as satellites, to the primary propulsion system of interplanetary or interstellar spacecraft. This system also doesn't require additional heat or radiation shielding to protect the rest of the space craft which make the system (not including fuel compartment) light in comparison to other designs.
