In the linear domain, we are able to apply familiar linear
techniques to the new signal, Cs(v). In particular, we might
wish to apply Fourier analysis to view the frequency domain
properties of the new signal. Because Cs(v) is a periodic func-
tion of v, it is appropriate to compute the Fourier series
coefﬁcients for the ‘‘harmonics’’ of the signal. These would
take the form:12
