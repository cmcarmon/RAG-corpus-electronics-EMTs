1. The  push-pull  converter.  The  duty  ratio  of  each  transistor  in  a  push-pull  converter  (Fig.  30.25)  is  less
than  0.5.  Some  of  the  advantages  are  that  the  transformer  ﬂux  swings  fully,  thereby  the  size  of  the
transformer is much smaller (typically half the size) than single-ended converters, and output ripple is
twice the switching frequency of transistors, allowing smaller ﬁlters.
