Show that if vA = A volts (constant), the cycle-average of vB has a steady-state value
equal to −(C1/C2)A. In other words, for low-frequency signals, the circuit behaves
like a non-inverting amplifier with gain −(C1/C2).
Show, for vA a step of amplitude A volts, and assuming vB is initially zero, that
the cycle average of vB ‘‘charges up’’ to its steady-state value with time constant
τ = c3/f0C2. That is, show that the cycle-average of vB obeys a first-order linear
differential equation with time constant C3/f0C2.
