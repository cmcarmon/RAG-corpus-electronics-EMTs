Since op-amps are generally DC coupled, there will appear a nonzero output even when the
inputs are grounded or connected to give no input signal. The voltage oﬀset is the result of
slightly diﬀerent transistors making up the diﬀerential input stage. The voltage oﬀset can
be reduced by using an externally-adjustable bias resistor (voltage oﬀset null circuitry).
