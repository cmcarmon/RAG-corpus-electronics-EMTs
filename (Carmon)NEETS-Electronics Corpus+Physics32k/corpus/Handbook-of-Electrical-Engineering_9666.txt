Message Authentication Schemes
Message authentication is a task related to the setting considered for encryption schemes; that is, communication
over an insecure channel. This time, we consider an active adversary that is monitoring the channel and may
alter the messages sent on it. The parties communicating through this insecure channel wish to authenticate
the  messages  they  send  so  that  their  counterpart  can  tell  an  original  message  (sent  by  the  sender)  from  a
modiﬁed one (i.e., modiﬁed by the adversary). Loosely speaking, a scheme for message authentication requires
