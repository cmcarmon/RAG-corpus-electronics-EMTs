The customer reactions toward the NAVi5 were mixed. Some liked the more “direct” feel and better fuel economy it offered compared to those of typical automatic gearboxes. Others, however, were turned off by what they felt as awkward shifting program and the acceleration gap during shifting. The NAVi5 also required gentle throttle operations when accelerating from standstill since it didn’t offer creep function.
It was outsold by the conventional manual and automatic gearboxes in both the Aska and Gemini and subsequently dropped in the next generation Gemini. (Isuzu stopped manufacturing the Aska in-house after the first generation.)
