If the intermediate frequency is 455 kilohertz and the bfo is tuned to 456 kilohertz or 454 kilohertz,
the difference frequency of 1 kilohertz is heard in the output. Generally, you will tune the bfo from the
front panel of a receiver. When you vary the bfo control, you are varying the output frequency of the bfo
and will hear changes in the tone of the output audio signal.
