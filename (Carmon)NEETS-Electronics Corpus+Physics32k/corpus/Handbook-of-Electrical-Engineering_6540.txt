When  the  ﬁrst  laser  was  demonstrated  in  1960,  numerous  applications  of  this  magniﬁcent  new  tool  were
anticipated. Some predicted that laser beams would transmit messages through the air at high data rates between
distant stations. Although laser beams can indeed travel through the atmosphere, too many problems prevent
this scheme from becoming practical. Included in the objections are the need for line-of-sight paths and the
unpredictability of transmission through an atmosphere where weather variations randomly change path losses.
Guided paths using optical ﬁbers offer the only practical means of optical transmission over long distances.
