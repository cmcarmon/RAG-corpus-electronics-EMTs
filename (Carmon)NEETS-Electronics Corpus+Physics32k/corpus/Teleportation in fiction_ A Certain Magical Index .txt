In this light novel, 2.3 million students have esper ability, classified from level 0 to level 5: level 0 is no ability and level 5 is the most powerful and dangerous. One of the supporting characters, Shirai Kuroko, is a teleporter; she becomes the main character in the spin-off. Her power is instant teleportation, which allows her to teleport herself and/or anything she touches under a total weight of around 130-137 kilograms to anywhere within a radius of around 81â€“85 meters. She is classified as Level 4. Another character, Awaki Musujime, has an ability called Move Point. Her teleportation powers are more powerful than Kuroko's, as she can teleport anything weighing up to 4,500 kg without even touching it for a distance up to 800 meters. However, due to a past trauma where she miscalculated and teleported her leg inside a wall, accidentally tearing her leg skin and muscles out from the wall and almost dying, she has a fear of using her powers on herself and feels physically ill whenever she is forced to teleport herself. This fear prevents her from becoming a Level 5.
