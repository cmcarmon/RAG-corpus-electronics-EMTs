combines the incoming rf with the local oscillator signal to produce the intermediate frequency, which is
then amplified by one or more IF amplifier stages. You should note that the fm receiver has a wide-band
IF amplifier. The bandwidth for any type of modulation must be wide enough to receive and pass all the
side-frequency components of the modulated signal without distortion. The IF amplifier in an fm receiver
must have a broader bandpass than an AM receiver.
