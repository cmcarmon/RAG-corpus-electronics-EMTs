If the Hamiltonian is not explicitly time dependent, i.e. if



H
(

q

,

p

,
t
)
=
H
(

q

,

p

)


{\displaystyle H({\boldsymbol {q}},{\boldsymbol {p}},t)=H({\boldsymbol {q}},{\boldsymbol {p}})}
, then the Hamiltonian does not vary with time at all:
and thus the Hamiltonian is a constant of motion, whose constant equals the total energy of the system,



H
=
E


{\displaystyle H=E}
. Examples of such systems are the pendulum, the harmonic oscillator or dynamical billiards.
