Thus, the ampliﬁer block is a linear circuit block in which the output is proportional to the
input, and the ampliﬁer is characterized by the three constants Ri, Ro, and A. The input and output
resistances may be generalized to input and output impedances in ac systems. The advantage of the
model is that all internal complexities are summarized in the three constants, thereby simplifying
the analysis of electric systems with ampliﬁers. Power-supply connections are usually not shown
in circuit diagrams since they would only clutter up the drawing. It is assumed, however, that
there are always connections to some power source in order to bring in the power necessary to
run the ampliﬁer (as will be illustrated in Example 5.1.4).
