The  non-unit  schemes,  while  also  intended  to  protect  speciﬁc  areas,  have  no  ﬁxed  boundaries. As  well  as
protecting their own designated areas, the protective zones can overlap into other areas. While this can be very
beneﬁcial for backup purposes, there can be a tendency for too great an area to be isolated if a fault is detected
by different non-unit schemes. The most simple of these schemes measures current and incorporates an inverse
time characteristic into the protection operation to allow protection nearer to the fault to operate ﬁrst. While
this is relatively straightforward for radial schemes, in networks, where the current paths can be quite different
depending on operating and maintenance strategies, protection can be difﬁcult to set and optimum settings
are probably impossible to achieve. It is in these areas where protection software has become useful to manu-
facturers, consultants, and utilities.
