A conductor is a material in which the forbidden gap is so narrow that it can be considered 
nonexistent. A semiconductor is a solid that contains a forbidden gap, as shown in figure 3-2, view A. 
Normally, a semiconductor has no electrons at the conduction band energy level. The energy provided by 
room temperature heat, however, is enough energy to overcome the binding force of a few valence 
electrons and to elevate them to the conduction band energy level. The addition of impurities to the 
semiconductor material increases both the number of free electrons in the conduction band and the 
number of electrons in the valence band that can be elevated to the conduction band. Insulators are 
materials in which the forbidden gap is so large that practically no electrons can be given enough energy 
to cross the gap. Therefore, unless extremely large amounts of heat energy are available, these materials 
will not conduct electricity.
