As the switch is closed, the battery voltage is applied to the input terminals of the line. Now, C1 has
no charge and appears, effectively, as a short circuit across points A and B. The full battery voltage
appears across inductor L1. Inductor L1 opposes the change of current (0 now) and limits the rate of
charge of C1.
