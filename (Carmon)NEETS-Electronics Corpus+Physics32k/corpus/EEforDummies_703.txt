Identifying ICs with part numbers
Every IC has a unique code, such as 7400 or 4017, to identify the type of 
device — really, the circuit — that’s inside. You can use this code, also 
known as a part number, to look up specifications and parameters about an IC 
in an online resource. The code is printed on the top of the chip.
