referred to as the ‘‘reﬂection error’’ since it is a nonphysical
reﬂection due to the PEC wall that backs the PML. We note
that the reﬂection error is the same for both the split-ﬁeld PML
and the UPML, because both support the same wave equation.
This error decreases exponentially with sw and d. However, the
reﬂection error increases as exp(cos u), reaching the worst case
for u ¼ 90. At this grazing angle of incidence, R ¼ 1 and the
PML is completely ineffective. To be useful in an FDTD simula-
tion, we want R(u) to be as small as possible. Clearly, for a thin
PML, we must have sw as large as possible to reduce R(u) to
acceptably small levels, especially for u approaching 908.
