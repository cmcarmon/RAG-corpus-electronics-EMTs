In 1795 a new law replaced the three names gravet, grave and bar by a single generic unit name: the gram. The new gram was equal to the old gravet. Four new prefixes were added to cover the same range of units as in 1793 (milligram, centigram, decigram, gram, decagram, hectogram, kilogram, myriagram). The brass prototype of the grave was renamed to provisional kilogram.
In 1799 the provisional units were replaced by the final ones. Delambre and Méchain had completed their new measurement of the meridian, and the final metre was 0.03% smaller than the provisional one. Hence the final kilogram, being the mass of one cubic decimetre of water, was 0.09% lighter than the provisional one. In addition, the temperature specification of the water was changed from 0 °C to 4 °C, the point where the density of water is maximal. This change of temperature added 0.01% to the final kilogram. In 1799 a platinum cylinder was made that served as the prototype of the final kilogram. It was called the Kilogramme des Archives as it was stored in the Archives Nationales in Paris. This standard stood for the next ninety years.
