As discussed in chapter 1, the frequency range from elf to shf is from below 300 hertz up to 30 
gigahertz. The first area we will cover is the lower frequency bands (medium frequency [mf] and below). 
You will then get a look at the microwave region and the high-frequency and ultrahigh-frequency range 
as it pertains to the naval tactical data system (NTDS).
