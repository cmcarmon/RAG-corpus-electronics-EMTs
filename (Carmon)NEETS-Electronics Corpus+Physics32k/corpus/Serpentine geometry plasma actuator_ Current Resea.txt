Serpentine geometry plasma actuators (like other Dielectric Barrier Discharge actuators, i.e. plasma actuators) are able to induce an atmospheric plasma and introduce an electrohydrodynamic body force to a fluid. This body force can be used to implement flow control, and there are a range of potential applications, including drag reduction for aircraft and flow stabilization in combustion chambers.
The important distinction between serpentine plasma actuators and more tradition geometries is that the geometry of the electrodes has been modified in order to periodic across its span. As the electrode has been made periodic, the resulting plasma and body force are also spanwise periodic. With this spanwise periodicity, three-dimensional flow effects can be induced in the flow, which cannot be done with more traditional plasma actuator geometries.
It is thought that the introduction of three-dimensional flow effects allow for the plasma actuators to apply much greater levels of control authority as they allow for the plasma actuators to project onto a greater range of physical mechanisms (such as boundary layer streaks or secondary instabilities of the Tollmien-Schlichting wave). Recent work indicate that these plasma actuators may have a significant impact on controlling laminar and transitional flows.
With the greater level of control authority that these plasma actuators may potentially possess, there is currently research being performed at several labs in the United States and in the United Kingdom looking to apply these actuators for real world applications.
