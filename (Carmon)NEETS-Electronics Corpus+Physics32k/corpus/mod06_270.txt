Another undesirable characteristic of tetrodes associated with secondary emission is that the outputs
are NOISY. What this means is that small sporadic signals appear on the main output signal, as shown in
figure 1-32. When electrons are knocked from the plate, they represent losses of plate current and
corresponding positive pulses on the output. Electrons falling back to the plate represent increases in plate
current and cause negative-going pulses to appear in the output.
