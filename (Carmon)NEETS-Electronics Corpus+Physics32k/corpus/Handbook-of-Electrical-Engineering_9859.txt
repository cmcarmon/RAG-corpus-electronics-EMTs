Figure  100.16  illustrates  the  gain  magnitude  and  phase  shift  curves  for  a  single-stage  lag-lead  network
equalizer or compensator transfer function. Figure 100.17 illustrates an electrical network realization of a passive
lag-lead  network  equalizer.  Parameter  matching  can  be  used  to  determine  the  electrical  network  parameters
that yield a speciﬁed transfer function. Because the relationships between the break frequencies and the equalizer
component values are complex, it may be desirable, particularly in preliminary instrumentation of the control
system,  to  use  analog  or  digital  computer  programming  techniques  to  construct  the  equalizer.  Traditionally,
there has been much analog computer simulation of control systems. The more contemporary approach suggests
use of digital computer approaches that require numerical approximation of continuous-time physical systems.
Figure 100.18 presents a ﬂowchart that we may use for lag-lead network design. We see that this ﬂowchart
has much in common with the charts and design procedures for lead network and lag network design and that
each of these approaches ﬁrst involves determining or obtaining a set of desired speciﬁcations for the control
system. Next, the form of a trial compensating network and the number of break frequencies in the network
are selected. We must then obtain a number of equations, equal to the number of network break frequencies
plus  1.  One  of  these  equations  shows  that  the  gain  magnitude  is  1  at  the  crossover  frequency.  The  second
equation will be an equation for the phase shift at crossover. It is generally desirable that there be at least two
unspeciﬁed compensating network break frequencies such that we may use a third equation, the optimality of
the phase shift at crossover equation, in which we set db/dwUw=wc = 0. If other equations are needed to represent
the design situation, we obtain these from the design speciﬁcations themselves.
