In this chapter, you discover how electric current flows through 
a circuit and why conventional current can be thought of as 
electrons moving in reverse. You also explore the depths 
of a simple electronic circuit that you can build yourself. 
Finally, you find out how to measure voltages and cur-
rents in that circuit and how to figure out the amount 
of power supplied and used in a circuit.
