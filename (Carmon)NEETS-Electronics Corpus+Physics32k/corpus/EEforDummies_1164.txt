The resistance reading should fall within the tolerance range of the nominal 
value marked on the resistor. For instance, if you test a resistor with a nomi-
nal value of 1 k立 and a tolerance of 10%, your test reading should fall in the 
range of 900 to 1,100 立. A bad resistor may be completely open inside (in 
which case you may get a reading of infinite 立), may be shorted out (in which 
case you get a reading of zero 立), or may have a resistance value outside its 
stated tolerance range.
