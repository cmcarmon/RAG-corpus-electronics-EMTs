into ordinary glass (a Kerr-type nonlinear material) from a
pair of optical waveguides on the left side. Each pulsed beam
has a 0.65-mm transverse width, while the beam-to-beam
spacing is in the order of 1 mm. In the absence of the control
soliton, the signal soliton would propagate to the right at the
speed of light in glass with zero deﬂection and then be col-
lected by a receiving waveguide. However, as shown in the
remaining panels of this ﬁgure, a copropagating control soli-
ton would ﬁrst merge with and then laterally deﬂect the signal
soliton to an alternate collecting waveguide. (Curiously, the
location of the two beams’ merger point would remain station-
ary in space while the beams would propagate at light-speed
through this point.) Overall, the optical pulse dynamics shown
in Figure 9.20 could provide the action of an all-optical ‘‘AND’’
gate working on a time scale about 1/10,000th that of existing
electronic digital logic.
