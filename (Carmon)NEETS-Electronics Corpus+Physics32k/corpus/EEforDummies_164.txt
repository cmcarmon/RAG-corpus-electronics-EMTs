You can build the LED circuit by using alligator clips to connect the compo-
nents or by using a solderless breadboard to make the connections. I walk 
you through both construction methods. Note that when I discuss taking 
voltage and current measurements, I provide pictures showing the bread-
board circuit. You can read more about constructing circuits in ChapterÂ 15.
