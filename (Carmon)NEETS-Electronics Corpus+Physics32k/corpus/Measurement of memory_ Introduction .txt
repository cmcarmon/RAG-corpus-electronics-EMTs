The measurement of memory in its various types has always been the favorite subject of Psychologists. According to them remembering involves those processes which are essential for memory. Basically, there appears to be three different memory systems.
Sensory information storage
Short-term memory
Long-term memory
As you progress through each of these systems in succession, the content gets more abstract and gets retained for longer and longer periods of time. The 5E's learning cycle shows the best interpretation of how scientists think information is purposefully facilitated to move throughout the brain and between these systems of memory.
