If



G


{\displaystyle G}
is a Lie group then from an inner product




g

e




{\displaystyle g_{e}}
on the tangent space





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
(the Lie algebra of



G


{\displaystyle G}
) one can construct a Riemannian metric on



G


{\displaystyle G}
as follows: if



v
,
w


{\displaystyle v,w}
belong to the tangent space at a point



γ
∈
G


{\displaystyle \gamma \in G}
put




g

γ


(
v
,
w
)
=

g

e


(

γ

∗


v
,

γ

∗


w
)


{\displaystyle g_{\gamma }(v,w)=g_{e}(\gamma ^{*}v,\gamma ^{*}w)}
where




γ

∗




{\displaystyle \gamma ^{*}}
indicates the tangent map (at



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
) of the diffeomorphism



x
↦

γ

−
1


x


{\displaystyle x\mapsto \gamma ^{-1}x}
of



G


{\displaystyle G}
.
The maps



x
↦
γ
x


{\displaystyle x\mapsto \gamma x}
for



γ
∈
G


{\displaystyle \gamma \in G}
are by definition isometries for this metric



g


{\displaystyle g}
. In particular, if



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is any discrete subgroup in



G


{\displaystyle G}
(so that it acts freely and properly discontinuously by left-translations on



G


{\displaystyle G}
) the quotient



Γ
∖
G


{\displaystyle \Gamma \backslash G}
is a Riemannian manifold locally isometric to



G


{\displaystyle G}
with the metric



g


{\displaystyle g}
.
The Riemannian volume form associated to



g


{\displaystyle g}
defines a Haar measure on



G


{\displaystyle G}
and we see that the quotient manifold is of finite Riemannian volume if and only if



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is a lattice.
Interesting examples in this class of Riemannian spaces include compact flat manifolds and nilmanifolds.
