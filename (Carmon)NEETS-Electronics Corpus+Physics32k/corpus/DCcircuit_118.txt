In this series of textbooks, I have committed to using electron ﬂow notation. Ironically, this
was not my ﬁrst choice. I found it much easier when I was ﬁrst learning electronics to use
conventional ﬂow notation, primarily because of the directions of semiconductor device symbol
arrows. Later, when I began my ﬁrst formal training in electronics, my instructor insisted on
using electron ﬂow notation in his lectures. In fact, he asked that we take our textbooks (which
were illustrated using conventional ﬂow notation) and use our pens to change the directions of
all the current arrows so as to point the ”correct” way! His preference was not arbitrary, though.
In his 20-year career as a U.S. Navy electronics technician, he worked on a lot of vacuum-tube
equipment. Before the advent of semiconductor components like transistors, devices known
as vacuum tubes or electron tubes were used to amplify small electrical signals. These devices
work on the phenomenon of electrons hurtling through a vacuum, their rate of ﬂow controlled
by voltages applied between metal plates and grids placed within their path, and are best
understood when visualized using electron ﬂow notation.
