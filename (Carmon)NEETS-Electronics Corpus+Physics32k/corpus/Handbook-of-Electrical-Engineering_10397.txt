b. Space surveillance, terrestrial surveillance, data fusion. The quantity and quality of surveillance systems
continues rapid growth utilizing sensors from ground-based, airborne, and space-based vantages. Remote
sensing requirements continue to expand the need for real time digital data communications. Unmanned
Airborne Vehicles (UAV) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) platform developments continue
as a response to a broad range of C3I needs. Two classes of surveillance are active surveillance systems
(radar, sonar, and optical) and passive systems (electronic surveillance measuring (ESM), acoustic, infra-
red and visual imagery). Passive techniques are preferred as they do not leave a signature that can be
exploited by adversaries. A plethora of new sensor systems challenges the currently available communi-
cations, processors, and processing systems. Particularly challenging is both the fusion of the outputs of
multiple similar sensors and also of dissimilar sensor systems. Fusion protocols and tracking algorithms,
software intensive, claim an increasing fraction of available resources. With multiple new sensor systems,
a  technology  challenge  is  the  processing,  correlation,  and  fusing  of  surveillance  data  into  intelligence
products and their distribution in a timely and usable form.
