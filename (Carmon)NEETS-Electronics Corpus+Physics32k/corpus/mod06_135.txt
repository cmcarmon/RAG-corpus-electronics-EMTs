This is the maximum voltage that can be applied to a tube in the reverse direction (plate negative
with respect to the cathode)-exceeding this will cause arc-over from the plate to the cathode and will
damage the tube. PIV, as this is sometimes abbreviated, becomes very important in the rectifier circuit to
be discussed as a later major subject.
