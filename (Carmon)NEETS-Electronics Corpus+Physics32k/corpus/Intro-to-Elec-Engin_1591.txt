Typical ratings of these devices are given in Table 16.1.2. Whereas this comprehensive table,
as of 1983, is given here for illustration purposes only, several new developments have taken
place since then: A single thyristor is currently available with the capability of blocking 6.5
kV and controlling 1 kA. The 200-V Schottky barrier diodes are commercially available with
ratings of several hundred amperes, up to 1 kA, and with blocking voltages as high as 1â€“5 kV.
