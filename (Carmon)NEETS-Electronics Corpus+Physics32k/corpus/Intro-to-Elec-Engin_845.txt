The structure of a power system can be divided into generation (G), transmission, (T), and
distribution (D) facilities, as shown in Figure 10.3.1. An ac three-phase generating system provides
the electric energy; this energy is transported over a transmission network, designed to carry power
at high or extrahigh voltages over long distances from generators to bulk power substations and
major load points; the subtransmission network is a medium to high-voltage network whose
purpose is to transport power over shorter distances from bulk power substations to distribution
substations. The transmission and subtransmission systems are meshed networks with multiple-
path structure so that more than one path exists from one point to another to increase the reliability
of the transmission system.
