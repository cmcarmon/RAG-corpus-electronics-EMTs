LOCs may provide advantages, which are specific to their application. Typical advantages are:
low fluid volumes consumption (less waste, lower reagents costs and less required sample volumes for diagnostics)
faster analysis and response times due to short diffusion distances, fast heating, high surface to volume ratios, small heat capacities.
better process control because of a faster response of the system (e.g. thermal control for exothermic chemical reactions)
compactness of the systems due to integration of much functionality and small volumes
massive parallelization due to compactness, which allows high-throughput analysis
lower fabrication costs, allowing cost-effective disposable chips, fabricated in mass production
part quality may be verified automatically
safer platform for chemical, radioactive or biological studies because of integration of functionality, smaller fluid volumes and stored energies
