Earth Systems engineering is essentially the use of systems analysis methods in the examination of environmental problems. When analyzing complex environmental systems, there are numerous data sets, stakeholders and variables. It is therefore appropriate to approach such problems with a systems analysis method. Essentially there are “six major phases of a properly-conducted system study”. The six phases are as follows:
Determine Goals of System
Establish Criteria for Ranking Alternative Candidates
Develop Alternatives Solutions
Rank Alternative Candidates
Iterate
Action
Part of the systems analysis process includes determining the goals of the system. The key components of goal development include the development of a Descriptive Scenario, a Normative Scenario and Transitive Scenario. Essentially, the Descriptive Scenario “describe[s] the situation as it is [and] tell[s] how it got to be that way” (Gibson, 1991). Another important part of the Descriptive Scenario is how it “point[s] out the good features and the unacceptable elements of the status quo”. Next, the Normative Scenario shows the final outcome or the way the system should operate under ideal conditions once action has been taken. For the Earth Systems approach, the “Normative Scenario” will involve the most complicated analysis. The Normative Scenario will deal with stakeholders, creating a common trading zone or location for the free exchange of ideas to come up with a solution of where a system may be restored to or just how exactly a system should be modified. Finally the Transitive scenario comes up with the actual process of changing a system from a Descriptive state to a Normative state. Often, there is not one final solution, as noted in adaptive management. Typically an iterative process ensues as variables and inputs change and the system coevolves with the analysis.
