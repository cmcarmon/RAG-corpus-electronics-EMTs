It is possible to simulate virtually any type of circuit using a program like SPICE. The programs have built-
in elements for resistors, capacitors, inductors, dependent and independent voltage and current sources, diodes,
MOSFETs, JFETs, BJTs, transmission lines, transformers, and even transformers with saturating cores in some
versions.  Found  in  commercial  versions  are  libraries  of  standard  components  which  have  all  necessary
