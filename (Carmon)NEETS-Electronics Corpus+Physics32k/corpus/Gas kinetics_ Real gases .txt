Real gases are characterized by their compressibility (z) in the equation PV=zn0RT. When the pressure, P, is set as a function of the volume, V, where the series is determined by set temperatures, T, P and V began to take hyperbolic relationships that are exhibited by ideal gases as the temperatures start to get very high. A critical point is reached when the slope of the graph is equal to zero and makes the state of the fluid change between a liquid and a vapor. The properties of ideal gases contain viscosity, thermal conductivity, and diffusion.
