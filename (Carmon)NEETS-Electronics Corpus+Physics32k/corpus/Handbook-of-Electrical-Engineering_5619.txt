In addition to the references provided, papers sponsored by the Power System Relaying Committee of the IEEE
and  published  in  the  IEEE Transactions  on  Power  Delivery  contain  a  wealth  of  information  about  protective
relaying  practices  and  systems.  Publications  of  CIGRÉ  also  contain  papers  on  relaying,  through  their  Study
Committee  34  on  protection.  Relays  and  relaying  systems  usually  follow  standards,  issued  by  IEEE  in  this
country, and by such international bodies as the IEC in Europe. The ﬁeld of computer relaying has been covered
in Computer Relaying for Power Systems, by A.G. Phadke and J.S. Thorp (New York: Wiley, 1988).
