Figure 36-30 shows a half-wave voltage doubler. It 
produces a DC output voltage that is twice the peak 
value of the input signal. Figure 36-31 shows the cir-
cuit during the negative alternation of the input signal. 
Diode D1 conducts, and the current flows along the 
path shown. Capacitor C1 charges to the peak value of 
the input signal. Because there is no discharge path, 
capacitor C1 remains charged. Figure 36-32 shows the 
positive alternation of the input signal. At this point, 
capacitor C1 is charged to the negative peak value. This 
keeps diode D1 reverse biased and makes diode D2 for-
ward biased. This allows diode D2 to conduct, charg-
ing capacitor C2. Because capacitor C1 is charged to 
the maximum negative value, capacitor C2 charges to 
twice the peak value of the input signal.
