Some technical manuals also contain voltage charts on which all the voltage measurements are
tabulated. These charts usually indicate the sensitivity of the meter (for example, 20,000 ohms/volt) used
to obtain the voltage readings for the chart. To obtain comparable results, you must use a voltmeter of the
same sensitivity (or greater) as that specified. Make certain that the voltmeter is not "loading" the circuit
while taking a measurement. If the meter resistance is not considerably higher than the circuit resistance,
the reading will be markedly lower than the true circuit voltage because of the voltmeterâ€™s loading effect.
(To calculate meter resistance, multiply the rated ohms-per-volt sensitivity value of the meter by the scale
in use. For example, a 1,000-ohms-per-volt meter set to the 300-volt scale will have a resistance of
300,000 ohms.)
