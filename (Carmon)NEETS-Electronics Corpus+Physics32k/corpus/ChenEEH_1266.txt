Dynamic RAM (DRAM) possesses a characteristic similar to
a capacitor; that is, for every read access, a power refresh is
required to maintain the data. In addition, a power refresh
is also required every 15 ms just to hold the information. Over
the years, DRAM has been mainly used to implement the main
memory in most computer systems. Some of the most com-
monly used DRAMs are given in the following list:
