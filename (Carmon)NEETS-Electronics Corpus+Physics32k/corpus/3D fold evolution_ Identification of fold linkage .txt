Amid, relative height of surface in the horizontal middle of the surface in the area of approaching fold tips, is useful for defining the status of two approaching structures in the spectrum from no linkage to linear or en-echelon linkage. Relative height is defined as the surface elevation of the point of interest minus the average surface elevation of the area of the approaching fold tips (see fig.15).
If Amid>0, linkage is present.
If Amid<0, linkage is absent.
If Amid~0, the structure is in the transitional zone between linkage and no-linkage.
After determining the presence of linkage between twofold segments, it is possible to identify linear linkage between the segments by a straight antiformal saddle in between the two main folds. For an en-echelon linkage, the main folds of the segments would be linked by a curved antiformal saddle in between.
