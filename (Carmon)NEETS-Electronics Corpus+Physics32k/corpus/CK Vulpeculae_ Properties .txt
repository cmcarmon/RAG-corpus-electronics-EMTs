The luminosity of the central object, estimated from infrared dust emission, is about 0.9 L☉. The luminosity required to energise the observed nebulosity is calculated at 3 L☉ from an object at 60,000 K At the time of its eruption, the luminosity of CK Vulpeculae is calculated to have been at least 24,000 L☉. Known ionic emission lines in the spectrum, and unidentified absorption features in the infrared indicate a temperature between 14,000 K and 100,000 K.
