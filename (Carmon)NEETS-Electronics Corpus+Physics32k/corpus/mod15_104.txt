When the teeth of two mechanical gears are meshed and a turning force is applied, the gears turn in 
opposite directions. If a third gear is added, the original second gear turns in the same direction as the 
first. This is an important concept, because the output of a synchro receiver is often connected to the 
device it operates through a train of mechanical gears. Whether or not the direction of the force applied to 
the device and the direction in which the receiver rotor turns are the same depends on whether the number 
of gears in the train is odd or even. The important thing, of course, is to move the dial or other device in 
the proper direction. Even when there are no gears involved, the receiver rotor may turn in the direction 
opposite to the direction you desire. To correct this problem, some method must be used to reverse the 
receiver's direction of rotation. In the transmitter-receiver system, this is done by reversing the S1 and S3 
connections so that SI of the transmitter is connected to S3 of the receiver and vice versa (fig. 1-17), view 
(A) and view (B).
