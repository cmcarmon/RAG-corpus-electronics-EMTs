The name lepton comes from the Greek λεπτός leptós, "fine, small, thin" (neuter nominative/accusative singular form: λεπτόν leptón); the earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek 𐀩𐀡𐀵, re-po-to, written in Linear B syllabic script. Lepton was first used by physicist Léon Rosenfeld in 1948:

Following a suggestion of Prof. C. Møller, I adopt—as a pendant to "nucleon"—the denomination "lepton" (from λεπτός, small, thin, delicate) to denote a particle of small mass.

The etymology incorrectly implies that all the leptons are of small mass. When Rosenfeld named them, the only known leptons were electrons and muons, whose masses are indeed small compared to nucleons—the mass of an electron (0.511 MeV/c2) and the mass of a muon (with a value of 105.7 MeV/c2) are fractions of the mass of the "heavy" proton (938.3 MeV/c2). However, the mass of the tau (discovered in the mid 1970s) (1777 MeV/c2) is nearly twice that of the proton, and about 3,500 times that of the electron.
