Recent studies indicated that ancient Egyptians used the properties of sand to create capillary bridges by using water on it. In this way, they reduced surface friction and were capable to move statues and heavy pyramid stones. Some contemporary arts, like Sand art, are also close related to capability of water to bridge particles. In Atomic force microscopy, when one works in higher humidity environment, his studies might be affected by the appearance of nanosized capillary bridges. These bridges appear when the working tip approaches the studied sample. Capillary bridges also play important role in soldering process.

Capillary bridges also widely spread in living nature. Bugs, flies, grasshoppers and tree frogs are capable to adhere to vertical rough surfaces because of their ability to inject wetting liquid into the pad-substrate contact area. This way is created long range attractive interaction due to the formation of capillary bridges. Many medical problems involving respiratory diseases, and the health of the body joints depend on tiny capillary bridges. Liquid bridges are now commonly used in growth of cell cultures because of the need to mimic work of living tissues in scientific research.
