Solar radiation pressure causes perturbations to orbits. The magnitude of acceleration it imparts to a spacecraft in Earth orbit is modeled using the equation below:

{\displaystyle a_{R}\approx -4.5\times 10^{-6}(1+r)A/m}

where:





a

R




{\displaystyle a_{R}}
is the magnitude of acceleration in meters per second-squared.




A


{\displaystyle A}
is the cross-sectional area exposed to the Sun in meters-squared.




m


{\displaystyle m}
is the spacecraft mass in kilograms.




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the reflection factor which depends on material properties.



r
=
0


{\displaystyle r=0}
for absorption,



r
=
1


{\displaystyle r=1}
for specular reflection, and



r
≈
0.4


{\displaystyle r\approx 0.4}
for diffuse reflection.
For orbits around the Earth, solar radiation pressure becomes a stronger force than drag above 800 km altitude.
