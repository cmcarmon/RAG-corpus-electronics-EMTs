In  the  early  1980s,  there  was  signiﬁcant  debate  over  which  LAN  connection  arrangement  was  superior,  a
single  choice  being  viewed  as  necessary.  This  debate  centered  on  such  issues  as  cost,  network  throughput,
network delay, and growth potential. Performance evaluation based on queueing theory played a major role in
putting these issues in perspective. For thorough descriptions of LAN protocols and queueing models used to
evaluate their performance, the interested reader is referred to Hammond and O’Reilly [1986].
