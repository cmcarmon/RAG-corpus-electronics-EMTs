The  resulting  graph  is  shown  in  Fig.  A8.7.  To 
obtain the graph, a point is plotted for each pair of 
corresponding  values  for  v and  i. When  all  the 
points have been drawn they are connected together 
by drawing a line. Notice that, in this case, the line 
that connects the points together takes the form of a
