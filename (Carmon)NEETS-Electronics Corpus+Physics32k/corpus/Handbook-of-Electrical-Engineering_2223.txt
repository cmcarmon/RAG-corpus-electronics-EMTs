Corresponding  temperature  dependence  is  shown  for  silicon  in  Fig. 22.4.  Around  room  temperature  n  =
Nd –  Na,  while  at  low  temperatures  n  is  an  exponential  function  of  temperature  with  the  activation  energy
DWd /2 for n > Na and DWd for n < Na. The reduction of n compared with the net impurity concentration Nd –
Na is known as a freeze-out effect. This effect does not take place in the heavily doped semiconductors.
