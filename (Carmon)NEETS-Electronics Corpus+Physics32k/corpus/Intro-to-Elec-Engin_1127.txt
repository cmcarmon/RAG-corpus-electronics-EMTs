Polyphase Induction Machine Performance
Some of the important steady-state performance characteristics of a polyphase induction motor
include the variation of current, speed, and losses as the loadâ€“torque requirements change, and the
starting and maximum torque. Performance calculations can be made from the equivalent circuit.
All calculations can be made on a per-phase basis, assuming balanced operation of the machine.
Total quantities can be obtained by using an appropriate multiplying factor.
