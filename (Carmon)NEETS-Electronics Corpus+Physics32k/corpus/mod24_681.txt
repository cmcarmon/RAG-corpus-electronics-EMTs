Fiber optic transmitters can be classified into two categories: digital and analog. Digital transmitters
produce two discrete optical power levels. These levels are essentially on and off with the exception that
some light is emitted in the off state by some transmitters. Analog transmitters continuously vary the
output optical power level as a function of the input electrical signal.
