Increasing the length of the fork, for example by switching from rigid to suspension, raises the front of a bicycle and thus decreases its head angle. Lengthening the fork would have the opposite effect on the rake of a motorcycle, since rake is measured in the opposite direction.
A rule of thumb is a 10 mm change in fork length gives a half degree change in the steering axis angle.
