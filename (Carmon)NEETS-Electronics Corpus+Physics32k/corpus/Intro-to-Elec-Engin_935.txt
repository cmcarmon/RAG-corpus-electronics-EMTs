*11.1.6 The total core loss for a specimen of magnetic
sheet steel is found to be 1800 W at 60 Hz.
When the supply frequency is increased to 90
Hz, while keeping the ï¬‚ux density constant, the
total core loss is found to be 3000 W. Determine
the hysteresis and eddy-current losses separately
at both frequencies.
11.1.7 A magnetic circuit is found to have an ac hystere-
sis loss of 10 W when the peak current is Im = 2
A. Assuming the exponent of Bm to be 1.5 in
Equation (11.1.4), estimate Ph for Im = 0.5 A
and 8 A.
