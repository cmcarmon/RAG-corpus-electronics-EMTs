The concept of evolution in time is central to the theory of dynamical systems as seen in the previous sections: the basic reason for this fact is that the starting motivation of the theory was the study of time behavior of classical mechanical systems, that is the study of the initial value problems for their describing systems of ordinary differential equations.

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {x}}}}
represents the velocity of the material point x
v: T × M → M is a vector field in Rn or Cn and represents the change of velocity induced by the known forces acting on the given material point. Depending on the properties of this vector field, the mechanical system is called
autonomous, when v(t, x) = v(x)
homogeneous when v(t, 0) = 0 for all t

The solution is the evolution function already introduced in above

Some formal manipulation of the system of differential equations shown above gives a more general form of equations a dynamical system must satisfy
