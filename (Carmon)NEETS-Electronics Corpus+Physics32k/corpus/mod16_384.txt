Most meggers you will use are rated at 500 volts; however, there are other types. Meggers are
usually equipped with friction clutches, which are designed to slip if the generator is cranked faster than
its rated speed. This prevents the generator speed and output voltage from exceeding rated values. A
1,000-volt generator is available for extended ranges. When an extremely high resistance, such as 10,000
megohms or more, is to be measured, a high voltage is needed to cause enough current flow to actuate the
meter movement.
