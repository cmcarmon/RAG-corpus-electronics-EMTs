Q
=



K
W
L

H




{\displaystyle Q={\frac {KWL}{H}}}

where:
Q is the total volume of wear debris produced
K is a dimensionless constant
W is the total normal load
L is the sliding distance
H is the hardness of the softest contacting surfaces
Note that



W
L


{\displaystyle WL}
is proportional to the work done by the friction forces as described by Reye's hypothesis.
