Smoothing
In  computing  the  language  model  probabilities,  we  desire  the  following:  fewer  parameters  to  estimate;  the
available  data  is  sufÔ¨Åcient  for  the  estimation  of  parameters;  and  that  the  probability  can  be  constructed  at
recognition  time  from  the  parameter  values  while  occupying  limited  storage.  Several  smoothing  techniques
have  been  proposed  to  handle  the  scarcity  of  data  [25].  These  are  essential  in  the  construction  of  n-gram
language models. They include linear smoothing, also known as deleted interpolation, backing-off, bucketing
