To compress audio signals by a factor as large as eleven while maintaining a quality exceeding that of a local
  in  a  given
FM  radio  station  requires  sophisticated  algorithms  for  reducing  the 
signal. A large portion (but usually less than 50%) of the bit-rate reduction in an audio coder is due to the ﬁrst
of the two mechanisms. Eliminating irrelevant portions of an input signal is done with the help of psychoa-
coustic  models.  It  is  obvious  that  a  coder  can  eliminate  portions  of  the  input  signal  that—when  played
back—will  be  below  the  threshold  of  hearing.  More  complicated  is  the  case  when  we  have  multiple  signal
components that tend to cover each other, that is, when weaker components cannot be heard due to the presence
of stronger components. This effect is called 
. To let a coder take advantage of masking effects, we need
to  use  good  masking  models.  Masking  can  be  modeled  in  the  time  domain  where  we  distinguish  so-called
before
simultaneous masking (masker and maskee occur at the 
 maskee). Simultaneous masking usually is modeled in
maskee), and backward masking (masker occurs 
the frequency domain. This latter case is illustrated in Fig. 19.5.
