One simple solution to organizing tools is to use a 
toolbox. A toolbox is a box or container for tool storage. 
Toolboxes come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so choose 
one thatâ€™s proportional in size to the number of tools in 
the workshop. The best toolboxes will have several com-
partments to help keep everything organized (Figure 
8-1). Put the tools you use most  often near the top com-
partments and those you use less frequently down below.
If the electronics shop does not have a toolbox at each 
workspace, then the hand tools will be organized in a 
separate storage cabinet on a tool panel. Many times the 
tools will be outlined on the tool panel where they are to 
be stored (Figure 8-2). Keep in mind that the hand tools 
used on a regularly basis should be easily accessible.
