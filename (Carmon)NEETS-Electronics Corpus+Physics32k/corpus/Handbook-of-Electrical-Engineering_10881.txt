Fast Yet Flexible Command Language
MATLAB  clearly  satisﬁes  this  criterion  as  is  evidenced  by  the  natural  interaction  shown  in  Fig.  112.3.  For
CACSD use, it is debatable whether the principle still holds, mainly because of the way that the package entities
needed for control have to be constructed and managed by the user. Nonetheless, no-one could complain that
matrix environments are not ﬂexible: the growing number of new control applications for them provides ample
evidence of that.
