While Einstein first mentioned a variable speed of light in 1907, he reconsidered the idea more thoroughly in 1911. In analogy to the situation in a medium, where a shorter wavelength

{\displaystyle c=\nu \lambda }
, leads to a lower speed of light, Einstein assumed that clocks in a gravitational field run slower, whereby the corresponding frequencies

Einstein commented (pages 906–907):

"Aus dem soeben bewiesenen Satze, daß die Lichtgeschwindigkeit im Schwerefelde eine Funktion des Ortes ist, läßt sich leicht mittels des Huygensschen Prinzipes schließen, daß quer zum Schwerefeld sich fortpflanzende Lichtstrahlen eine Krümmung erfahren müssen."
("From the just proved assertion, that the speed of light in a gravity field is a function of position, it is easily deduced from Huygens's principle that light rays propagating at right angles to the gravity field must experience curvature.")

In a subsequent paper in 1912, he concluded that:

“Das Prinzip der Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit kann nur insofern aufrechterhalten werden, als man sich auf für Raum-Zeitliche-Gebiete mit konstantem Gravitationspotential beschränkt.“
(“The principle of the constancy of the speed of light can be kept only when one restricts oneself to space-time regions of constant gravitational potential.”)

However, Einstein deduced a light deflection at the Sun of “almost one arcsecond” which is just one-half of the measured value later derived by his theory of general relativity. While the measured value was later provided by Eddington in 1919, Einstein never gave up his VSL theory but calculated it differently in his General Theory of 1915 and 5 editions of his book beginning with equation 107 and the several paragraphs that follow it. Notably, in 1911 he had considered variable time only, while in general relativity, albeit in another theoretical context, both space and time measurements are influenced by nearby masses. Many scientists including Peter Bergmann are in disagreement with Einstein while other scientists most notably Max Born are in agreement.
