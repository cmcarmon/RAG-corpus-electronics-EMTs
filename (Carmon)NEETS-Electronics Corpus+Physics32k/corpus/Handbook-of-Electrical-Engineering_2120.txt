Inhomogeneities,  such  as  dust,  sea  organisms,  schools  of  ﬁsh,  sea  mounds  on  the
bottom of the sea, form mass density discontinuities in the ocean medium. When an acoustic wave strikes
these inhomogeneities, some of the acoustic energy is reﬂected and reradiated. The sum total of all such
reradiations is called reverberation. Reverberation is present only in active sonar, and in the case where
the object echoes are completely masked by reverberation, the sonar system is said to be “reverberation
limited.”
