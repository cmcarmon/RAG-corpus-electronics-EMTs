Like bond length, when three atoms are connected with two chemical bonds, the two bonds tend to form a fixed angle. Any variation from this fixed equilibrium angle contributes to protein potential energy. Total potential energy based on angle is defined as over set Sangle the triplet of atoms that are connected by two chemical bonds;
Eangle = Σ (i,j,k) E Sanglekijka(αijk-αijk0)2
where:
kijk is the force constant
αijk0 is the equilibrium angle
αijk is the bond angle
