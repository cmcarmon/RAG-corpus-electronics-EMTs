Maximizing Safety
Frequently in practice, a target clock period TCP is established
for a speciﬁc circuit implementation. Making the target clock
period smaller may not be a primary design objective. If this is
the case, alternative optimization strategies may be sought
such that the resulting circuit is more tolerant to inaccuracies
in the timing parameters. Two different classes of timing pa-
rameters are considered—the local data path delays and the
clock delays (respectively, the clock skews). Note ﬁrst that the
clock skew scheduling process depends on accurate knowledge
