This  section  introduces  the  reader  to  the  analytical  methodologies  that  underlie  the  design  of  small  signal,
analog bipolar junction transistor (BJT) ampliﬁers. Analog circuit and system design entails complementing
basic circuit analysis skills with the art of architecting a circuit topology that produces acceptable input-to-
output  (I/O)  electrical  characteristics.  Because  design  is  not  the  inverse  of  analysis,  analytically  proﬁcient
engineers are not necessarily adept at design. However, circuit and system analyses that conduce an insightful
understanding of meaningful topological structures arguably foster design creativity. Accordingly, this section
focuses more on the problems of interpreting analytical results in terms of their circuit performance implica-
tions  than  it  does  on  enhancing  basic  circuit  analysis  skills.  Insightful  interpretation  breeds  engineering
understanding.  In  turn,  such  an  understanding  of  the  electrical  properties  of  circuits  promotes  topological
reﬁnements and innovations that produce reliable and manufacturable, high performance electronic circuits
and systems.
