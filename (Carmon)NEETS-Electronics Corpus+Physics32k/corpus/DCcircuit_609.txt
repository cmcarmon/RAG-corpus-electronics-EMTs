At the end of the series and parallel circuits chapter, we brieﬂy considered how circuits
could be analyzed in a qualitative rather than quantitative manner. Building this skill is an
important step towards becoming a proﬁcient troubleshooter of electric circuits. Once you have
a thorough understanding of how any particular failure will affect a circuit (i.e. you don’t have
to perform any arithmetic to predict the results), it will be much easier to work the other way
around: pinpointing the source of trouble by assessing how a circuit is behaving.
