The NONADIABATIC calorimeter uses an rf termination with a resistive film strip or LOSSY 
dielectric materials (solids or liquids that are designed to efficiently dissipate the applied power) as a load. 
Temperature indication can be accomplished with thermocouples, thermopiles, thermistors, 
thermometers, bimetallic strips, and manometers. Calibration is against a power standard or known low-
frequency power.
