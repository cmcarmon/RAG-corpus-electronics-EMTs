SHB results from the nonuniform distribution of optical power along the length of the laser. In DFB lasers,
because of the grating feedback, the longitudinal distribution of optical power can be highly nonuniform. This
results in distortion [Takemoto et al., 1990] that can add to or cancel other distortion, making it, in some cases,
a desirable effect.
