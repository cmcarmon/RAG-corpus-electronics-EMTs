The exclusive NOR (X-NOR) gate is nothing more than an X-OR gate with an inverted output. It
produces a HIGH output when the inputs are either all HIGH or all LOW. The standard symbol and the
Truth Table are shown in figure 3-4. The operation function sign is Â¯  with a vinculum over the entire
expression.
