The memory unit stores programs and data. There are two main classes of memory devices called primary
and secondary memory. Primary storage, or main memory, is an electronic storage device, constructed from
integrated  circuits  that  consist  of  millions  of  semiconductor  storage  cells,  each  capable  of  storing  one  bit  of
information. These cells are accessed in groups of Ô¨Åxed size called words. The main memory is organized so
that the contents of one word can be stored or retrieved in one basic operation called a memory cycle.
