The first step of the analysis of Fichera as well as the first step of the analysis of Antonio Signorini in Signorini 1959 is the analysis of the potential energy, i.e. the following functional

where

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\mathcal {U}}_{\Sigma }}
i.e. the set of displacement vectors satisfying the system of boundary conditions (3) or (4). The meaning of each of the three terms is the following
the first one is the total elastic potential energy of the elastic body
the second one is the total potential energy due to the body forces, for example the gravitational force
the third one is the potential energy due to surface forces, for example the forces exerted by the atmospheric pressure
Signorini (1959, pp. 129–133) was able to prove that the admissible displacement

: however Gaetano Fichera gave a class of counterexamples in (Fichera 1964b, pp. 619–620) showing that in general, admissible displacements are not smooth functions of these class. Therefore, Fichera tries to minimize the functional (6) in a wider function space: in doing so, he first calculates the first variation (or functional derivative) of the given functional in the neighbourhood of the sought minimizing admissible displacement
