In the year 1733, Charles Dufay, a French scientist, made an important discovery about
electrification. He found that when a glass was rubbed with fur, both the glass rod and the fur became
electrified. This realization came when he systematically placed the glass rod and the fur near other
electrified substances and found that certain substances which were attracted to the glass rod were
repelled by the fur, and vice versa. From experiments such as this, he concluded that there must be two
exactly opposite kinds of electricity.
