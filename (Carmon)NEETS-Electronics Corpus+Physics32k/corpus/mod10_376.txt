The magnitude of the received signal depends on the number of turbulences causing scatter in the 
desired direction and the gain of the receiving antenna. The scatter area used for tropospheric scatter is 
known as the scatter volume. The angle at which the receiving antenna must be aimed to capture the 
scattered energy is called the scatter angle. The scatter volume and scatter angle are shown in figure 2-26.
