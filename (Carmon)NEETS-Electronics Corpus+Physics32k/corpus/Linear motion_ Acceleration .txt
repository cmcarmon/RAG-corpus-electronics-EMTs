Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. Acceleration is the second derivative of displacement i.e. acceleration can be found by differentiating position with respect to time twice or differentiating velocity with respect to time once. The SI unit of acceleration is



m

s

−

{\displaystyle ms^{-2}}
or metre per second squared.
If

v





{\displaystyle \mathbf {a_{av}} }

{\displaystyle \Delta \mathbf {v} =\mathbf {v_{2}} -\mathbf {v_{1}} }
is the average velocity over the time interval
