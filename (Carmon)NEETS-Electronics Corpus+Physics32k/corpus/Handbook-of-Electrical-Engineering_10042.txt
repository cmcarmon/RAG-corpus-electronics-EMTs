Optimal Estimation: The Kalman Filter
It was noted above that the optimal controller for the linear quadratic cost criterion takes the form of full-state
feedback. However, it is often the case that the full state is not physically available for feedback. Rather, it is
usually the output that is measurable, so that we prefer a technique that uses y(t) (and possibly u(t)) to construct
the control signal instead of the state x(t).
