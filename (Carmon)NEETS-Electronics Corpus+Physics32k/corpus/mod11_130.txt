The TRAVELING-WAVE TUBE (twt) is a high-gain, low-noise, wide-bandwidth microwave 
amplifier. It is capable of gains greater than 40 dB with bandwidths exceeding an octave. (A bandwidth of 
1 octave is one in which the upper frequency is twice the lower frequency.) Traveling-wave tubes have 
been designed for frequencies as low as 300 megahertz and as high as 50 gigahertz. The twt is primarily a 
voltage amplifier. The wide-bandwidth and low-noise characteristics make the twt ideal for use as an rf 
amplifier in microwave equipment.
