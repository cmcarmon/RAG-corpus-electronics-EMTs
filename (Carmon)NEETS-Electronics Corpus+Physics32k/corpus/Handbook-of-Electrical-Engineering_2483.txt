We will now consider a representative example. We will let CGS = 10 pF and CGD = 5 pF. We will assume that
the net load driven by the drain of the transistors is Rnet = 2 kW and CL = 10 pF. The signal-source resistance
R1 = 100 W. The JFET will have IDSS = 10 mA, IDSQ = IDSS /2 = 5 mA, and VP = –4 V, so gm = 3.535 mS. Thus
the midfrequency gain is AV = –gm Rnet = –3.535 mS · 2 kW = –7.07. Therefore we have that
