Folded Dipole Antenna
Figure 6.13 shows the geometry of a folded dipole antenna. It
consists of a source (Vin) connected to the ends of a wire of
total length 2L and folded once as a rectangular loop of height
L and width d  L. The length L can have any value but is
often designed to be about l0=2 for a resonant operation. This
antenna conÔ¨Åguration can be viewed as a superposition of an
odd mode and an even mode, having dual excitations at the
center of the two arms of the antenna with odd and even
symmetry. The odd mode represents a transmission line
mode of operation without any radiation. Here, the top and
bottom sections are two identical transmission-line stubs of
length L=4 connected in series, as shown in Figure 6.13. The
input current It in this mode can then be related to Vin as
follows:
