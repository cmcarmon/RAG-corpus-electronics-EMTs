When trouble occurs in solid-state equipment, you should first check power supplies and perform
voltage measurements, waveform checks, signal substitution, or signal tracing. If you isolate a faulty
stage by one of these test methods, then voltage, resistance, and current measurements can be made to
locate defective parts. When you make these measurements, the voltmeter impedance must be high
enough that it exerts no appreciable effect upon the voltage being measured. Also, current from the
ohmmeter you use must not damage the transistors. If the transistors are not soldered into the equipment,
you should remove the transistors from the sockets during a resistance test. Transistors should be
removed from or reinserted into the sockets only after power has been removed from the stage; otherwise
damage by surge currents may result.
