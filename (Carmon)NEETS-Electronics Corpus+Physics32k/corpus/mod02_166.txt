In figure 3-6(A), an uncharged capacitor is shown connected to a four-position switch. With the switch
in position 1 the circuit is open and no voltage is applied to the capacitor. Initially each plate of the capacitor
is a neutral body and until a difference of potential is impressed across the capacitor, no electrostatic field
can exist between the plates.
