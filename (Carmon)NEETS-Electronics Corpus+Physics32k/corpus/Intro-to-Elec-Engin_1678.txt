The purpose of the Ô¨Ålter located between the sampler and the controlled process is for
smoothing, because most controlled processes are normally designed to receive analog signals.
Figure 16.3.2 illustrates a typical digital control system, in which the signal at one or more
points of the system is expressed in a numerical code for digital-computer or digital-transducer
processing in the system. Because of the digitally coded (such as binary-coded) signals in some
parts of the system, it becomes necessary to employ digital-to-analog (D/A) and analog-to-digital
(A/D) converters. In spite of the basic differences between the structures and components of a
sampled-data and a digital control system, from an analytical standpoint both types of systems
are treated by the same analytical tools.
