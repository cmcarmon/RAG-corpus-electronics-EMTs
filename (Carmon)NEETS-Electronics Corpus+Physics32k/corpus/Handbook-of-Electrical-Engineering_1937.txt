The  single  host  formulation  of  the  retiming  transformation  preserves  the  latency  of  the  algorithm.  The
retiming formulation with no constraints on latency (i.e., with separate input and output hosts) can also achieve
pipelining with no retiming
. Pipelining with retiming is the most desirable transfor-
mation in DSP architecture design. Pipelining with retiming can be interpreted to be identical to retiming of
the original algorithm with a large number of delays at the input edges. Thus, we can increase the system latency
arbitrarily and remove the appropriate number of delays from the inputs after the transformation.
