All of the various types of filters we have discussed so far have had only one section. In many cases, 
the use of such simple filter circuits does not provide sufficiently sharp cutoff points. But by adding a 
capacitor, an inductor, or a resonant circuit in series or in parallel (depending upon the type of filter action 
required), the ideal effect is more nearly approached. When such additional units are added to a filter 
circuit, the form of the resulting circuit will resemble the letter T, or the Greek letter pi (pi). They are, 
therefore, called T- or pi-type filters, depending upon which symbol they resemble. Two or more T- or 
piâˆ’type filters may be connected together to produce a still sharper cutoff point.
