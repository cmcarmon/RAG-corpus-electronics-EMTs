Lean body mass is a component of body composition, calculated by subtracting body fat weight from total body weight: total body weight is lean plus fat. In equations:
LBM = BW − BF
Lean body mass equals body weight minus body fat

LBM + BF = BW
Lean body mass plus body fat equals body weight

The percentage of total body mass that is lean is usually not quoted – it would typically be 60–90%. Instead, the body fat percentage, which is the complement, is computed, and is typically 10–40%. The lean body mass (LBM) has been described as an index superior to total body weight for prescribing proper levels of medications and for assessing metabolic disorders, as body fat is less relevant for metabolism.
