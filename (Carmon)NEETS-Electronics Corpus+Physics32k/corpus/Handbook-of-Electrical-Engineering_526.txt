Diodes
Most  diodes  are  made  from  a  host  crystal  of  silicon  (Si)  with  appropriate  impurity  elements  introduced  to
modify,  in  a  controlled  manner,  the  electrical  characteristics  of  the  device.  These  diodes  are  the  typical
pn
(unipolar),
produced by placing a metal layer directly onto the semiconductor [Schottky, 1938; Mott, 1938]. The metal-
-junction in the common diode structure. Other
semiconductor interface serves the same function as the 
semiconductor materials such as gallium-arsenide (GaAs) and silicon-carbide (SiC) are also in use for new and
specialized applications of diodes. Detailed discussion of diode structures and the physics of their operation
can be found in later paragraphs of this section.
