The stress history in Figure 2 is reduced to peaks and valleys in Figure 3.
Half-cycle (A) starts at tensile peak (1) and terminates opposite a greater tensile stress, peak (2); its magnitude is 16 MPa.
Half-cycle (B) starts at tensile peak (4) and terminates where it is interrupted by a flow from an earlier peak, (3); its magnitude is 17 MPa.
Half-cycle (C) starts at tensile peak (5) and terminates at the end of the time history.
Similar half-cycles are calculated for compressive stresses (Figure 4) and the half-cycles are then matched.
