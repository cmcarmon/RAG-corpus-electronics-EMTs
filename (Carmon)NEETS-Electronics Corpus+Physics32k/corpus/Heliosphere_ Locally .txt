Of particular interest is the Earth's interaction with the heliosphere, but its extent and interaction with other bodies in the solar system have also been studied. Some examples of missions that have or continue to collect data related to the heliosphere include (see also List of heliophysics missions):
Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory
Solar Dynamics Observatory
STEREO
Ulysses (spacecraft)
During a total eclipse the high-temperature corona can be more readily observed from Earth solar observatories. During the Apollo program the Solar wind was measured on the Moon via the Solar Wind Composition Experiment. Some examples of Earth surface based Solar observatories include the McMathâ€“Pierce solar telescope or the newer GREGOR Solar Telescope, and the refurbished Big Bear Solar Observatory.
