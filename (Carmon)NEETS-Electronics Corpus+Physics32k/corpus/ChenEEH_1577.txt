where P(A) represents the unconditional or prior probability
that A is true and where P(AjB) represents the conditional or
posterior probability A given that all we know is B. This simple
equation underlies modern AI systems for probabilistic infer-
ence. The limitations of the Bayesian approach resides in the
assumptions that the evidences are independent, prior prob-
abilities are known, and the sets of hypotheses are both inclu-
sive and exhaustive.
