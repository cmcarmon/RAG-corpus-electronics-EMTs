As with planar waveguides, TE (Ez = 0) and TM (Hz = 0) modes corresponding to meridional rays exist in
the ﬁber. They are denoted by EH or HE modes, depending on which component,  E or H, is stronger in the
plane transverse to the direction or propagation. Because the cylindrical ﬁber is bounded in two dimensions
rather  than  one,  two  integers,  l  and  m,  are  needed  to  specify  the  modes,  unlike  one  integer,  m,  required  for
planar  waveguides.  The  exact  modes,  TElm ,  TMlm,  EHlm ,  and  HElm,  may  be  given  by  two  linearly  polarized
modes, LPlm. The subscript l is now such that LPlm corresponds to HEl + 1,m , EHl – 1,m, TEl – 1,m, and TMl – 1,m .
In general, there are 2l ﬁeld maxima around the ﬁber core circumference and m ﬁeld maxima along a radius
vector. Figure 42.8 illustrates the correspondence between the exact modes and the LP modes and their ﬁeld
conﬁgurations for the three lowest LP modes.
