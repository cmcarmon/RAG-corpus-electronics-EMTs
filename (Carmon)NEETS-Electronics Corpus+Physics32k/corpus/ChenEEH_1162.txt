The current trend of technology scaling is predicted to
continue. Feature sizes will continue to shrink to very deep
submicrometer (VDSM) dimensions and clock frequencies to
increase. Shrinking feature size implies not only shorter gate
lengths but also decreasing interconnect pitch and device
threshold voltages (Shepard and Narayanan, 1998). Now a
single integrated circuit (IC) can contain an entire system
(a system-on-a-chip [SOC]), and the interconnections can
have many interleaved signal layers and multiple planes of
interconnect. Die sizes remain relatively constant. Reduction
in the top and bottom areas of a minimum-width wire means
that total wire capacitance is decreasing. Resistance, however, is
