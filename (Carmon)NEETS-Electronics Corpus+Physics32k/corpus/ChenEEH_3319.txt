The fast decoupled power ﬂow algorithm is essentially a
highly simpliﬁed and approximated version of the Newton-
Raphson algorithm of the previous subsection. We recall that
the NR iteration steps are computation intensive because of
evaluating J k and solving the Jacobian equation 7.55. In this
subsection, we will proceed to simplify this by replacing the
iteration speciﬁc J k with a constant matrix.
