An ingenious method of measuring the subject resistance in a situation like this involves
the use of both an ammeter and a voltmeter. We know from Ohmâ€™s Law that resistance is equal
to voltage divided by current (R = E/I). Thus, we should be able to determine the resistance
of the subject component if we measure the current going through it and the voltage dropped
across it:
