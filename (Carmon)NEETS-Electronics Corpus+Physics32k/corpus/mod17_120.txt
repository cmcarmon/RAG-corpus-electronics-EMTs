There is some similarity between civilian and naval broadcasts. Just as commercial stations in the 
broadcast band transmit programs to radio receivers in the homes in their communities, Navy 
communications stations broadcast messages to fleet units in their particular geographic areas. The 
resemblance between Navy and commercial stations ceases there. Information broadcast by naval 
communications stations is contained in chronologically numbered messages addressed to the ships. The 
messages are copied by the fleet units, which check the serial numbers to ensure they have a complete 
file. This checks and balances system ensures the ship has not missed any of the broadcast message 
traffic.
