2. You are is probably wondering why the nomenclature of the drain and the source seems reversed
from the more logical choice relating the source to the input and the drain to the output. It turns
out that the names stem from the internal conduction properties of the MOSFET. Electrons are
the majority carriers in the n-channel MOSFET shown. S is the source of electrons and D is the
drain of electrons.
3. We will see a complementary MOS transistor called the p-channel transistor later.
4. We will examine increasingly sophisticated models for the MOSFET device in the following
chapters. These models will reflect aspects of the MOSFETâ€™s behavior that are not adequately
captured by our simple switch model.
5. To simplify the math in our quantatitive examples on MOSFETs, this book commonly uses
1-volt thresholds.
