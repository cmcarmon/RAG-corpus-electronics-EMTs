as the anatomic substrate underlying the spatial frequency and patterns of coherence. Therefore, discrete cortical
regions linked by such ﬁber systems should demonstrate a relatively high degree of synchrony, whereas the time
lag between signals, as represented by phase, quantiﬁes the extent to which one signal leads another.
