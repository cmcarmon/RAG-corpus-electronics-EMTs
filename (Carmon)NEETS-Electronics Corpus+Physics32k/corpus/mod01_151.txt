Magnetism can be induced in a magnetic material by several means. The magnetic material may be
placed in the magnetic field, brought into contact with a magnet, or stroked by a magnet. Stroking and
contact both indicate actual contact with the material but are considered in magnetic studies as
magnetizing by INDUCTION.
