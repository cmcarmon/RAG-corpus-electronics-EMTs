Superconducting Generators
The  demand  for  electricity  has  increased  steadily  over  the  years.  To  satisfy  the  increasing  demand,  there  has
been a trend in the development of generators with very high power rating. This has been achieved, to a great
extent, by improvement in materials and cooling techniques. Cooling is necessary because the loss dissipated
as heat poses a serious problem for winding insulation. The progress in machine design based on conventional
methods appears to reach a point where further increases in power ratings are becoming difÔ¨Åcult. An alternative
method involves the use of superconductivity.
