If, for example, the shunt resistor in the above circuit were sized at precisely 1 â„¦, there
would be 1 volt dropped across it for every amp of current through it. The voltmeter indication
could then be taken as a direct indication of current through the shunt. For measuring very
small currents, higher values of shunt resistance could be used to generate more voltage drop
