d
 = 225 Å or 2.25 Å/V, a small displacement indeed. We also note that Eq. (49.6) is
(from Table 49.2). Hence 
a  special  case  of  Eq. (49.2)  with  the  stress  equal  to  zero.  This  is  the  situation  when  an  actuator  is  used  in  a
force-free environment, for example, as a mirror driver. This arrangement results in the maximum displacement.
Any forces which tend to oppose the free motion of the PZT will subtract from the available displacement with
the reduction given by the normal stress-strain relation, Eq. (49.1).
