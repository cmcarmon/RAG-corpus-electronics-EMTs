This quiescent or bias current is very stable, because the change in VBE(3) due to temperature variations is
exactly matched by that required by  Q4 to produce the same current. The difference gain will be as discussed
above, but the common-mode gain will be extremely low because of the high incremental resistance rce presented
by the long-tail transistor.
