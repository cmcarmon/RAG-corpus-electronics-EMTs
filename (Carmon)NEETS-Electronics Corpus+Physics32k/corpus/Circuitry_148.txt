Example 3.6 
 
A Wheatstone bridge is based on the circuit shown 
in Fig. 3.14. If R1 and R2 can each be switched so 
that they have values of either 100 F or 1 kF and 
RV is variable between 10 F and 10 kF, determine 
the range of resistance values that can be measured.  
 
Solution 
 
The  maximum  value  of  resistance  that  can  be 
measured  will  correspond  to  the  largest  ratio  of 
R2:R1 (i.e. when R2 is 1 kF and R1 is 100 F) and the 
highest value of RV (i.e. 10 kF). In this case: 
 
R =
