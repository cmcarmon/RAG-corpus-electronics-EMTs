time failure estimation. A complete architecture of fault diag-
nosis and accommodation has also been presented by incorp-
orating the developed intelligent fault-tolerant control (FTC)
scheme with a cost-effective fault-detection scheme and a
multiple model-based failure diagnosis process to efÔ¨Åciently
handle the false alarms and the accommodation of both the
anticipated and unanticipated failures in online situations.
