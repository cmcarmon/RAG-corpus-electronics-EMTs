Each item in the walk‐through list just given focuses on one circuit compo-
nent and its connections. Although the list does mention the same connec-
tions multiple times, that’s consistent with good practice; it pays to check 
and double‐check your circuit connections by making sure each lead or pin 
of each individual component is connected correctly. (Ever hear the rule of 
thumb “measure twice, cut once”? Well, the same principle applies here.) 
You can’t be too careful when you’re connecting electronic components.
