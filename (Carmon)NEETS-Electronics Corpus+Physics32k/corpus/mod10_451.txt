Since any dielectric, even air, is not a perfect insulator, a small current known as LEAKAGE
CURRENT flows between the two wires. In effect, the insulator acts as a resistor, permitting current to
pass between the two wires. Figure 3-13 shows this leakage path as resistors in parallel connected
between the two lines. This property is called CONDUCTANCE (G) and is the opposite of resistance.
