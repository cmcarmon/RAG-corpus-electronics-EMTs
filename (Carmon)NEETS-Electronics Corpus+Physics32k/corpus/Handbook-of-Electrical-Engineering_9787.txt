  =  0.  This  is  alternatively  called  an  all-zero  model  or  a  ﬁnite  impulse  response  (FIR)
In  the  MA  model  all 
. This is called an all-pole model or an inﬁnite impulse
model. In the AR model all 
response (IIR) model. The ARMA model has both poles and zeros and also is an IIR model [Makhoul, 1975].
Adaptive and learning control systems have an experimental modeling aspect. The data ﬁtting is carried out
on-line, in real time, as part of the system operation. The modeling described above is normally done off-line
[Astrom and Wittenmark, 1989].
