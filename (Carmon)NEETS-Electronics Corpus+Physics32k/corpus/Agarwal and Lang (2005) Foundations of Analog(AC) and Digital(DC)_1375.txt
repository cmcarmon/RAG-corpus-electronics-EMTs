This is plotted in Figure 10.2c.
Some comments at this point help to give perspective. First, notice that
capacitor voltage starts from a zero value at t = 0 and reaches its final value
of I0R for large t. The increase from 0 to I0R has a time constant RC. The
final value of I0R for the capacitor voltage implies that all of the current from
the current source flows through the resistor, and the capacitor behaves like an
open circuit (for large t).
Second, the initial value of 0 for the capacitor voltage implies that at t = 0
all of the current from the current source must be flowing through the capacitor,
and none through the resistor. Thus the capacitor behaves like an instantaneous
short circuit at t = 0.
