6.26 Block Channel Coding34
Because of the higher datarate imposed by the channel coder, the probability of bit error occurring in the
digital channel increases relative to the value obtained when no channel coding is used. The bit interval
N in comparison to the no-channel-coding situation, which means the energy
duration must be reduced by K
per bit Eb goes down by the same amount. The bit interval must decrease by a factor of three if the
transmitter is to keep up with the data stream, as illustrated in Figure 6.21.
