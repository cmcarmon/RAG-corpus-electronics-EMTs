circuit	wizard (Figure 6-2) is a software system that 
combines schematic circuit design, simulation, PCB 
design, and CAD/CAM manufacture by New Wave 
Concepts. By integrating the entire design process, 
Circuit Wizard provides all the tools necessary to pro-
duce electronics projects from start to finish, includ-
ing on-screen testing of the PCB before assembly.
