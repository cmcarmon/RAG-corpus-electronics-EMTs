Notice, however, the expression for Z in Equation 5.7 is quite a bit differ-
ent from the expression for Z (namely, X + Y) shown in Table 5.4. The two
expressions are in fact equivalent. This should be self-evident since both expres-
sions represent the same truth table, but this fact will become obvious after
Section 5.5 (and specifically, Example 5.13) shows how such logic expressions
can be simplified.
