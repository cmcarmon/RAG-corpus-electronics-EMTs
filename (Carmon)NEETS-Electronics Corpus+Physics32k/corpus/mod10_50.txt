WAVE MOTION can be defined as a recurring disturbance advancing through space with or without
the use of a physical medium. Wave motion, therefore, is a means of moving or transferring energy from
one point to another point. For example, when sound waves strike a microphone, sound energy is
converted into electrical energy. When light waves strike a phototransistor or radio waves strike an
antenna, they are likewise converted into electrical energy. Therefore, sound, light, and radio waves are
all forms of energy that are moved by wave motion. We will discuss sound waves, light waves, and radio
waves later.
