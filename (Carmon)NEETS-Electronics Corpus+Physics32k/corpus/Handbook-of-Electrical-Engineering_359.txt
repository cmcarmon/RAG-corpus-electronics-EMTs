What  is  required  is  to  maximize  P.  For  a  function  of  more  than  one  variable,  this  is  done  by  setting  the
partial  derivatives  with  respect  to  each  of  the  independent  variables  equal  to  zero;  that  is, ¶P/¶RL  =  0  and
¶P/¶XL =  0.  Carrying  out  these  differentiations  leads  to  the  result  that  maximum  power  will  be  transferred
when the load impedance is the conjugate of the Thévenin impedance of the circuit: ZL = Z*T . If the Thévenin
impedance is purely resistive, then the load resistance must equal the Thévenin resistance.
