In atmospheric sciences, one often refers to the optical depth of the atmosphere as corresponding to the vertical path from Earth's surface to outer space; at other times the optical path is from the observer's altitude to outer space. The optical depth for a slant path is τ = mτ′, where τ′ refers to a vertical path, m is called the relative airmass, and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as m = sec θ where θ is the zenith angle corresponding to the given path. Therefore,

{\displaystyle T=e^{-\tau }=e^{-m\tau '}.}

The optical depth of the atmosphere can be divided into several components, ascribed to Rayleigh scattering, aerosols, and gaseous absorption. The optical depth of the atmosphere can be measured with a sun photometer.
The optical depth with respect to the height within the atmosphere is given by

{\displaystyle \tau (z)=k_{a}w_{1}\rho _{0}He^{-z/H}}

In both equations:
ka is the absorption coefficient
w1 is the mixing ratio
ρ0 is the density of air at sea level
H is the scale height of the atmosphere
z is the height in question

{\displaystyle \tau =Q_{e}\left[{\frac {9\pi L^{2}HN}{16\rho _{l}^{2}}}\right]^{1/3}}

where:
Qe is the extinction efficiency
L is the liquid water path
H is the geometrical thickness
N is the concentration of droplets
ρl is the density of liquid water
