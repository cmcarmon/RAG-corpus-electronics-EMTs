algorithms for solving differential-algebraic equations is given
in (Brenan et al., 1989). Modeling issues with an emphasis on
analog circuits are covered in Mantooth and Fiegenbaum
(1995) and Berge´ et al. (1995). The language reference of
VHDL–AMS is given by the IEEE Computer Society (1999).
The Mentor Graphics (1999) user’s manual is a good reference
for a commercial simulator. Finally, in Vachoux et al. (1997),
the modeling of multinature systems using VHDL–AMS is
addressed by several authors, thus giving an in-depth insight
into this evolving area.
