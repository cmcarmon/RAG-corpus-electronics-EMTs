Seebeck voltages are quite small, in the tens of millivolts for most temperature ranges. This
makes them somewhat difÔ¨Åcult to measure accurately. Also, the fact that any junction between
dissimilar metals will produce temperature-dependent voltage creates a problem when we try
to connect the thermocouple to a voltmeter, completing a circuit:
