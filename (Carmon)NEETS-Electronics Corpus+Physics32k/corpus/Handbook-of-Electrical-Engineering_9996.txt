The solution for w

the actual measured frequency of oscillation will differ from this value by an amount which will be smaller the
closer the oscillation is to a sinusoid. The exact frequency of oscillation in this case will be 1.708 rads/sec in
error  by  a  relatively  small  amount.  For  a  square  wave  input  to  the  plant  at  this  frequency,  the  plant  output
signal will be distorted by a small percentage. The distortion, d, is deÔ¨Åned by
