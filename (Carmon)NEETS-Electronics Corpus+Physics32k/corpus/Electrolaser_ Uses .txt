Methods of use:
To kill or incapacitate a living target through electric shock.
To seriously damage, disable, or destroy any electric or electronic devices in the target.
As electrolasers and natural lightning both use plasma channels to conduct electric current, an electrolaser can set up a light-induced plasma channel for uses such as:
To study lightning
During a thunderstorm, to make lightning discharge at a safe time and place, as with a lightning conductor.
Directing atmospheric lightning to a terrestrial collection station for the purpose of electrical power generation.
As a weapon, to make a thunderhead deliver a precise lightning strike onto a target from an aircraft; in this case, the aircraft and laser can be compared to a triggered spark gap, in that the relatively minor amount of initial input from the laser allows a large amount of energy to flow between the cloud and the ground.

Because of the plasma channel, an electrolaser may cause an accident if there is a thunderstorm (or other electricity sources such as overhead powerlines) about. (See Taser for more information â€“ principles of operation, controversies, etc.)
An electrolaser is not presently practical for wireless energy transfer due to danger and low efficiency.
