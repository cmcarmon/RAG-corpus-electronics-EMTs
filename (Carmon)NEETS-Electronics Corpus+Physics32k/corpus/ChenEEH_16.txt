A current is the ﬂow of electric charge that is measured by
its ﬂow rate as coulombs per second with the units of ampere
[A]. An ampere is deﬁned as the ﬂow of charge at the rate of
one coulomb per second (1 A ¼ 1 C/s). In other words, current
i(t) through a cross section at time t is given by dq/dt, where
