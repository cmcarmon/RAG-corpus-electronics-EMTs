At large VD the curves ﬂatten out, and the current is less sensitive to drain bias. The MOSFET is said to be
in saturation. There are different reasons for this behavior, depending upon the ﬁeld along the channel caused
by the drain voltage. If the source-drain separation is short, near or below a micrometer, the usual drain voltage
is sufﬁcient to create ﬁelds along the channel of more than a few 2104 V/cm. In this case the carrier energy is
sufﬁcient for carriers to lose energy by causing vibrations of the silicon atoms composing the crystal (optical
phonon emission). Consequently, the carrier velocity does not increase much with increased ﬁeld, saturating
at a value usat < 107 cm/s in silicon MOSFETs. Because the carriers do not move faster with increased VD , the
current also saturates.
