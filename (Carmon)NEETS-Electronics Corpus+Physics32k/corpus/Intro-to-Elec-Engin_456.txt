In terms of negative feedback, there exists an analogy between the operational ampliÔ¨Åer and
the power-steering mechanism of an automobile. The hydraulic pump is analogous to the power
supply in an op-amp circuit. The position of the booster-cylinder piston that is linked to the steering
is analogous to the op-amp output signal; the mechanical linkage between the control valve and
the booster-cylinder piston is analogous to the feedback circuit; the control-valve response to the
difference between the input from the steering wheel and the position of the steering linkage is
analogous to the op-amp response to its differential input signal. Thus the automotive power-
assisted steering system is but an example of negative feedback in a mechanical sense.
