Generalized Complex Fourier Transform
The CT Fourier transform characterized by Eqs. (14.11a) and (14.11b) can be generalized by considering the
variable jw to be the special case of u = s + jw with s = 0, writing Eqs. (14.11) in terms of u, and interpreting
u as a complex frequency variable. The resulting complex Fourier transform pair is given by Eqs. (14.11a) and
(14.11b):
