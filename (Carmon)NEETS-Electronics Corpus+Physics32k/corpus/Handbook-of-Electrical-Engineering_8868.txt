 cache maps each memory location into either of two locations in the cache and
can be constructed essentially as two identical direct-mapped caches. However, both caches must be searched
at each memory access and the appropriate data selected and multiplexed on a tag match (hit). On a miss, a
choice must be made between the two possible cache lines as to which is to be replaced. A single LRU bit can
be saved for each such pair of lines to remember which line has been accessed more recently. This bit must be
toggled to the current state each time either of the cache lines is accessed.
