A Mars aircraft is a vehicle for flying in the atmosphere of Mars. So far, Mars lander entry, descent, and landing systems have passed through the atmosphere. Aircraft may provide in situ measurements of the atmosphere of Mars, as well as additional observations over extended areas. A long-term goal is to develop piloted Mars aircraft.
Compared to Earth, the air is thinner at the surface (less than 1%) but the gravity is lower (less than 40%). Also, the major component of Mars air, CO2 gas, is denser than Earth air for a given pressure.
