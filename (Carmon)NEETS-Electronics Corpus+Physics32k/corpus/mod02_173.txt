When a capacitor is fully charged and the source voltage is equaled by the counter electromotive force
(cemf) across the capacitor, the electrostatic field between the plates of the capacitor is maximum. (Look
again at figure 3-4.) Since the electrostatic field is maximum the energy stored in the dielectric is also
maximum.
