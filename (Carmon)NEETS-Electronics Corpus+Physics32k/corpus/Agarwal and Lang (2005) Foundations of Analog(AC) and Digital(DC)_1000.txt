This value of vDS is the desired lowest value of vO for saturation region
operation of the MOSFET amplifier. The corresponding value of the high-
est valid input voltage can be obtained from Equation 7.42, and is given
by vIN = vO + VT.
in Figure 7.40,
(cid:6)−1 + √
(cid:7)
vIN is given by
1 + 2VSRLK
Next, we will determine the lowest value of the valid input voltage denoted
by the point marked (x) in Figure 7.40. This point is the intersection of the load
line and the iDS versus vDS line for which vGS = VT. At this point, vO = vDS =
VS and vIN = vGS = VT.
