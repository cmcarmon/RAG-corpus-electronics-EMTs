As  long  as  a  few  basic  rules  can  be  remembered, 
recognizing  the  correct  voltages  present  at  the 
terminals of a transistor is a fairly simple process. 
The potentials applied to the transistor terminals are 
instrumental 
the  correct  bias 
conditions for operation as an amplifier, oscillator, 
or  switch.  If  the  transistor  is  defective,  the  usual 
bias  voltages  will  be  substantially  changed.  The 
functional  state  of  the  transistor  may  thus  be 
quickly determined by measuring the d.c. potentials 
present at the transistorâ€™s electrodes while it is still 
in circuit.
