of the designed system. Block diagrams are self-documenting and, when appropriately annotated, may form
complete and consistent speciÔ¨Åcations of control systems. It is, therefore, not surprising that a number of tools
for modeling (control) systems through block diagrams have emerged on the market over the last 5 to 10 years.
In  addition  to  serving  as  a  documentation  aid,  the  overall  cost  and  cycle  time  for  developing  complex
controllers  is  radically  reduced  if  analysis/simulation  code  and/or  real-time  code  is  automatically  generated
from  the  block-diagrams.  This  eliminates  time-consuming  manual  coding,  and  avoids  the  introduction  of
coding bugs.
