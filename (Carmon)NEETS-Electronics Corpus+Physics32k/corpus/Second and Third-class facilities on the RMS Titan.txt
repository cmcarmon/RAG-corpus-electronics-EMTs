Second-Class offered passengers a spacious library/lounge, smoking room, outdoor promenade, and dining room. There was also a barber shop off the main staircase on E-Deck and a Purser's Office where passengers could store their valuables. There were two staircases for Second-Class passengers - the main forward one communicated between the Boat Deck all the way down to F-Deck and featured an elevator, the first to be featured in Second-Class aboard an ocean liner. The second ran between F and B-Decks and directly accessed the Library and Smoking Room. Both stairways were more modestly designed than their First-Class counterparts; the balustrades were made entirely of oak and the flooring was in white and red patterned linoleum.
