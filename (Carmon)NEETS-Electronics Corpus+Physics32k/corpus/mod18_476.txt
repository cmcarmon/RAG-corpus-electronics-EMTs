Figure 4-8 shows a comparison of radar system performance versus maximum range. The system 
performance loss in dB includes both transmitter and receiver losses. You should note that with a loss of 5 
dB in both receiver and transmitter (a total of 10 dB), only 55 percent of the maximum range of the 
system is realized.
