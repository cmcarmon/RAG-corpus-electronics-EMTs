Back to our parallel circuit example, we should be able to see that multiple paths (branches)
for current reduces total resistance for the whole circuit, as electrons are able to ﬂow easier
through the whole network of multiple branches than through any one of those branch re-
sistances alone. In terms of resistance, additional branches result in a lesser total (current
meets with less opposition). In terms of conductance, however, additional branches results in
a greater total (electrons ﬂow with greater conductance):
