Terrestrial locomotion has evolved as animals adapted from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Locomotion on land raises different problems than that in water, with reduced friction being replaced by the effects of gravity.
There are three basic forms of locomotion found among terrestrial animals
Legged - Moving by using appendages
Limbless locomotion - moving without legs, primarily using the body itself as a propulsive structure.
Rolling - rotating the body over the substrate
