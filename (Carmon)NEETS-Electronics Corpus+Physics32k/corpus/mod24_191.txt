outer side. To maintain the phase of the light wave, the mode phase velocity must increase. When the
fiber bend is less than some critical radius, the mode phase velocity must increase to a speed greater than
the speed of light. However, it is impossible to exceed the speed of light. This condition causes some of
the light within the fiber to be converted to high-order modes. These high-order modes are then lost or
radiated out of the fiber.
