The Phase II Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCP Phase II) has changed from an all-
analog communications system to an all-digital communications system. The performance capability 
provided by the Phase II DSCS is limited by equipment availability. Extensive digital traffic capability 
has become common. You can credit this to the availability of digital modems (modulator/demodulator) 
and broadband equipment. Overall performance of the Phase II DSCS is a great improvement over the 
capabilities provided by Phase I DSCS. The Phase II satellites provide a great increase in effective 
radiated power and rf bandwidths. You will find these satellite configurations use wide coverage and 
narrow beam antennas. They provide an extensive range of communications services and capabilities. 
(This will be further discussed later, in this chapter.)
