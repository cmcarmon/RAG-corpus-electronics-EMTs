Further director elements can be added to increase 
the gain and reduce the beamwidth (i.e. the angle 
between  the  half-power  or  â€“3dB  power  points  on 
the  polar  characteristic)  of  Yagi  aerials.  Some 
typical gain and beamwidth figures for Yagi aerials 
are given in Table 13.2. From this data it is worth 
noting that aerial gain increases by an approximate 
3dB  every  time  the  antenna  doubles  in  size.  It  is 
also  worth  noting  the  diminishing  return  as  the 
Yagi becomes large (e.g. an increase of only 1 dB 
in gain as the aerial increases in size from 22 to 32 
elements!).
