A number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from this simple example. First, we
really do not have to repeat the load line construction fifty times to visualize the output
wave. It is clear from the graph that whenever the input voltage is negative, the diode
current is so small that vO is almost zero. Also, for large positive values of vI, the diode
voltage stays relatively constant at about 0.6 volts (due to the nature of the exponential),
so the voltage across the resistor will be approximately vI âˆ’ 0.6 V. This kind of insight
is the principal value of the graphical method.
