Figure 37.16 shows a mode launching structure for coaxial cable to rectangular waveguide transitions.
This structure provides good coupling between the TEM (transmission line) mode on a coaxial cable and
the TE10 mode in the waveguide because the antenna probe excites a strong transverse electric ﬁeld in the center
of the waveguide, directed between the broad walls. The distance between the probe and the short circuit back
wall is chosen to be approximately l/4, which allows the TE10 mode launched in this direction to reﬂect off the
short circuit and arrive in phase with the mode launched towards the right.
