In addition, the y(k) is the system output, the u(k) is the
control input satisfying u(k) 2 Su  R, the Sl and Su denote
complex sets, the n and m are constants that are not necessarily
known, and the d is the (known) relative degree of the system.
The control objective is to have the system output y(k) track
a known reference input r(k). Speciﬁcally, the objective of
sliding-mode control is to steer the system state trajectories
in a sliding surface that is deﬁned in terms of a stable polyno-
mial of the tracking error and to maintain the subsequent
motion of the state trajectories on this surface.
