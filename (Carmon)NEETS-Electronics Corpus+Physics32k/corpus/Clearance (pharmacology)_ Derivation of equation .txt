Equation 1 is derived from a mass balance:

=

)


{\displaystyle \Delta m_{body}=(-{\dot {m}}_{out}+{\dot {m}}_{in}+{\dot {m}}_{gen.})\Delta t\qquad (2)}

where:




Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta t}
is a period of time

{\displaystyle \Delta m_{body}}
the change in mass of the toxin in the body during



Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta t}









m

{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}_{in}}
is the toxin intake rate








m
˙




o
u
t




{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}_{out}}
is the toxin removal rate








m
˙




g
e
n
.




{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}_{gen.}}
is the toxin generation rate
In words, the above equation states:
The change in the mass of a toxin within the body (



Δ
m


{\displaystyle \Delta m}
) during some time



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
is equal to the toxin intake plus the toxin generation minus the toxin removal.
Since





m

b
o
d
y


=
C
⋅
V

(

)


{\displaystyle m_{body}=C\cdot V\qquad (3)}

and








m

o
u
t


=
K
⋅
C

(

)


{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}_{out}=K\cdot C\qquad (4)}

Equation A1 can be rewritten as:




Δ
(
C
⋅
V
)
=
(
−

)
Δ

(

)


{\displaystyle \Delta (C\cdot V)=(-K\cdot C+{\dot {m}}_{in}+{\dot {m}}_{gen.})\Delta t\qquad (5)}

If one lumps the in and gen. terms together, i.e.






m
˙



=




m
˙




i
n


+




m
˙




g
e
n
.




{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}={\dot {m}}_{in}+{\dot {m}}_{gen.}}
and divides by



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
the result is a difference equation:







Δ
(
C
⋅
V
)


Δ

=
−
K
⋅
C
+



m

(

)


{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta (C\cdot V)}{\Delta t}}=-K\cdot C+{\dot {m}}\qquad (6)}

If one applies the limit



Δ
t
→
0


{\displaystyle \Delta t\rightarrow 0}
one obtains a differential equation:







d

C

V
)


d

=
−
K
⋅
C
+



m
˙




(

)


{\displaystyle {\frac {d(C\cdot V)}{dt}}=-K\cdot C+{\dot {m}}\qquad (7)}

Using the Product Rule this can be rewritten as:




C



d
V


d

+
V



d

d

=
−
K
⋅
C
+



m

(

)


{\displaystyle C{\frac {dV}{dt}}+V{\frac {dC}{dt}}=-K\cdot C+{\dot {m}}\qquad (8)}

If one assumes that the volume change is not significant, i.e.



C



d
V


d
t



=
0


{\displaystyle C{\frac {dV}{dt}}=0}
, the result is Equation 1:

{\displaystyle V{\frac {dC}{dt}}=-K\cdot C+{\dot {m}}\qquad (1)}
