Equations (12.4.31) and (12.4.32) have shown that the torque is proportional to the peak values
of the interacting stator and rotor mmfs and also to the sine of the space-phase angle δ between
them (expressed in electrical units). The interpretation of the negative sign is the same as before, in
that the ﬁelds tend to align themselves by decreasing the displacement angle δ between the ﬁelds.
Equation (12.4.32) shows that it is possible to obtain a constant torque, varying neither with
time nor with rotor position, provided that the two mmf waves are of constant amplitude and
have constant angular displacement from each other. While it is easy to conceive of the two mmf
waves having constant amplitudes, the question would then be how to maintain a constant angle
between the stator and rotor mmf axes if one winding is stationary and the other is rotating. Three
possible answers arise:
