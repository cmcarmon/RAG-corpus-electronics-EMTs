An ammeter is used to measure current in a circuit. An 
ammeter (schematic symbol shown in Figure 15-4) can 
be considered a flow meter. It measures the number of 
electrons flowing past a given point in a  circuit. The elec-
trons must flow through the ammeter to  obtain a read-
ing as shown in Figure 15-5, and this is accomplished by 
opening the circuit and inserting the ammeter.
