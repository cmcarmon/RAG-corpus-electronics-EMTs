Thus, zero-percent load regulation is the ideal situation. It means that the output voltage is constant 
under all load conditions. While you should strive for zero percent load regulation, in practical circuits 
you must settle for something less ideal. Even so, by using a voltage regulator, you can hold the percent 
of regulation to a very low value.
