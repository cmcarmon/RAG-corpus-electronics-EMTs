With declining memory costs and increasing transmission bandwidths, 0.25 Mbytes is no longer considered
to be the large amount of data that it once was. This might suggest that the need for image compression is not
as  great  as  previously.  Unfortunately  (or  fortunately,  depending  on  one’s  point  of  view),  this  is  not  the  case
because our appetite for image data has also grown enormously over the years. The old 512 3 512 pixels  3
1 byte per pixel “standard’’ was a consequence of the spatial and gray scale resolution of sensors and displays
that  were  commonly  available  until  recently.  At  this  time,  displays  with  more  than  103  3  103  pixels  and
24 bits/pixel to allow full color representation (8 bits each for red, green, and blue) are becoming commonplace.
Thus, our 0.25-Mbyte standard image size has grown to 3 Mbytes. This is just the tip of the iceberg, however.
For example, in desktop printing applications, a 4-color (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) image of an 8.5 3
11  in.2  page  sampled  at  600  dots  per  in.  requires  134  Mbytes.  In  remote  sensing  applications,  a  typical
hyperspectral  image  contains  terrain  irradiance  measurements  in  each  of  200  10-nm-wide  spectral  bands  at
25-m  intervals  on  the  ground.  Each  measurement  is  recorded  with  12-bit  precision.  Such  data  are  acquired
from aircraft or satellite and are used in agriculture, forestry, and other ﬁelds concerned with management of
natural resources. Storage of these data from just a 10 3 10 km2 area requires 4800 Mbytes.
