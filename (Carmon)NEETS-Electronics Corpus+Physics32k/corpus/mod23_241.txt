The FM reproduce electronics work just like direct reproduce electronics, with one exception. FM
reproduce electronics must first demodulate the original input signal from the carrier frequency before the
intelligence can be sent to the output device for listening or analysis. Figure 5-5 shows a block diagram of
the FM reproduce electronics.
