Water balloons, like air balloons, are generally made from latex, which naturally decomposes. While there still could be some environmental impact if burst water balloons are left behind in the wild where animals might ingest them, that impact would be low. However, some air balloons are made from mylar, which does not decompose (or only extremely slowly). If mylar balloons are used as water bombs, then littering or leaving behind mylar balloons will have a much bigger environmental impact. The use of mylar balloons might be less problematic in closed controlled (indoor) environments where the material is subsequently collected and recycled, which is possible with mylar. (Latex balloons are compostable.)
