Starting in 1894, David Shearer designed and built the first car in Australia. It was capable of 15 miles per hour on the streets of Adelaide, South Australia. The boiler was his own design, being a horizontal boiler of the 'semi-flash' type. Steering was by a tiller type design and a photograph of the vehicle shows it carrying eight passengers. The news article on the car has a sectional drawing of the design. The cars first official road trial was in 1899.
