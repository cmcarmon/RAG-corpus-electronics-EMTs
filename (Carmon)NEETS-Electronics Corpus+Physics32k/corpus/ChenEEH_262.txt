With advanced inductor designs, the VRM duty cycle can be
adjusted. Figure 1.26 shows a changed inductor structure, a
center-tapped inductor, that can improve the VRM duty cycle.
Figure 1.27 shows an improved VRM topology with the center-
tapped inductor structure and a loss-less snubber that can
absorb the leakage inductance energy as well as reduce ripple
and voltage spikes (Zhou, 1999). With this topology, VRMs do
not need high-side gate drives, thus improving VRM efÔ¨Åciency
at high-input-voltages. To reduce input and output current
ripple, an interleave technique can be used, which is shown in
