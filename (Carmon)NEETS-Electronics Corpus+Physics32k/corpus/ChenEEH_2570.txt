Of all the modes, the TE011 is perhaps the most interesting
for practical applications because it has only a circumferential
current in both the cylindrical wall and the end metallic plates.
This means that the end plate is free to be moved to adjust the
length d for frequency tuning purpose, which hardly affects the
unloaded Q. The maximum Q can be obtained with d=a ¼ 2,
and a range of 20,000 to 60,000 is possible. This value is
signiﬁcantly higher than the achievable Q values of other
modes even though the TE011 is not the dominant mode.
This is why this mode is used in the design of precision
frequency meters that function on the basis of a circular cavity
resonator with a movable length of the cavity.
