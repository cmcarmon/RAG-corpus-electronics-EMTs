Thankfully, nothing bad happened, but had the engine been running and the shock felt at
my hand instead of my leg, I might have reﬂexively jerked my arm into the path of the rotating
fan, or dropped the metal wrench across the battery terminals (producing large amounts of
current through the wrench with lots of accompanying sparks). This illustrates another im-
portant lesson regarding electrical safety; that electric current itself may be an indirect cause
of injury by causing you to jump or spasm parts of your body into harm’s way.
