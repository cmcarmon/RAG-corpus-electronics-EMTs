Figure  83.18  illustrates  the  additional  complexity  that  would  be  required  by  even  a  simple  multiplexed
addressing  system.  The  backplane  and  segment  drivers  might  correspond  to  rows  and  columns  of  a  dot
matrix,  as  implied  in  the  diagram,  or  the  backplanes  may  identify  speciÔ¨Åc  characters  of  an  alphanumeric
display. Calculating the rms values of the difference voltages shown gives 0.42 Vtc for the on pixels and 0.24
Vtc for off, from which Vtc can be calculated for reliable operation if the critical voltage is known for the LCD
to be used.
