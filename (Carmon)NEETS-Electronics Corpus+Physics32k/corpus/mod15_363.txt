If you attempt to change the gyro's plane of rotor spin by rotating the case about the input axis, the 
gyro will precess as shown in figure 3-14. From what you learned earlier in this chapter, the gyro does not 
appear to be obeying the rules for precession. However, turning the gyro case has the same effect as 
applying a torque on the spin axis. This is illustrated by arrow F in figure 3-14. You can determine the 
direction of precession by using the right-hand rule we discussed earlier.
