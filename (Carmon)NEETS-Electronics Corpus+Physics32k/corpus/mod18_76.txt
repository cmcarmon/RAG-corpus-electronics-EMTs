The antennas of most radar systems are designed to radiate energy in a one-directional lobe or beam that
can be moved in bearing simply by moving the antenna. As you can see in figure 1-9, the shape of the
beam is such that the echo signal strength varies in amplitude as the antenna beam moves across the
target. At antenna position A, the echo is minimal; at position B, where the beam axis is pointing directly
at the target, the echo strength is maximum. Thus, the bearing angle of the target can be obtained by
moving the antenna to the position at which the echo is strongest. In actual practice, search radar antennas
move continuously; the point of maximum echo return is determined by the detection circuitry as the
beam passes the target or visually by the operator. Weapons-control and guidance radar systems are
positioned to the point of maximum signal return and maintained at that position either manually or by
automatic tracking circuits.
