The vO versus vIN relationship in the active region shows that vO decreases linearly
as vIN increases. The linear relationship applies as long as the BJT remains in its active
region of operation. The upper boundary (with respect to the input voltage) of the
active region is reached when vIN becomes large, and vO becomes small enough that
the condition
