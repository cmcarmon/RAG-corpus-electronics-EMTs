The Lie algebra of a Lie group



G


{\displaystyle G}
may be identified with either the left- or right-invariant vector fields on



G


{\displaystyle G}
. It is a well known result that such vector fields are isomorphic to




T

e


G


{\displaystyle T_{e}G}
, the tangent space at identity. In fact, if we let



G


{\displaystyle G}
act on itself via right-multiplication, the corresponding fundamental vector fields are precisely the left-invariant vector fields.
