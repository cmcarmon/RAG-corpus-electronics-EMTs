The atoms in insulating materials have very tightly-bound electrons, resisting free electron
ﬂow very well. However, insulators cannot resist indeﬁnite amounts of voltage. With enough
voltage applied, any insulating material will eventually succumb to the electrical ”pressure”
and electron ﬂow will occur. However, unlike the situation with conductors where current is in
a linear proportion to applied voltage (given a ﬁxed resistance), current through an insulator
is quite nonlinear: for voltages below a certain threshold level, virtually no electrons will ﬂow,
but if the voltage exceeds that threshold, there will be a rush of current.
