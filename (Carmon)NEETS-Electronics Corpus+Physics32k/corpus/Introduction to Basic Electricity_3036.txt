with the free electrons contained in it. Holes in the P 
material also drift toward the junction. The holes and 
electrons combine at the junction and appear to cancel 
each other. However, as the electrons and holes com-
bine, new electrons and holes appear at the terminals 
of the voltage source. The majority carriers continue to 
move toward the Pâ€“N junction as long as the voltage 
source is applied.
