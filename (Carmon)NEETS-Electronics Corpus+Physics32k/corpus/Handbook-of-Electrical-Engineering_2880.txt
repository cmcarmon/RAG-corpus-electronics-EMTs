Brieﬂy, all parts must be inspected prior to use. Functional parts testing should be performed on the same basis
as for through-hole devices. Each manufacturer of electronic assemblies is familiar with the various processes
used on through-hole parts, and similar processes must be in place on SMDs. Problems with solderability of
leads and lead planarity are two items that can lead to the largest number of defects in the ﬁnished product.
Solderability  is  even  more  important  with  SMDs  than  with  through-  hole  parts  because  all  electrical  and
mechanical strength rests within the solder joint, there being no hole-with-lead to add mechanical strength.
