The main field measurement technique involves optical time-domain reflectometry. An optical time-
domain reflectometer (OTDR) is recommended for conducting field measurements on installed optical
fibers or links of 50 meters or more in length. An OTDR requires access to only one fiber end. An OTDR
measures the attenuation of installed optical fibers as a function of length. It also identifies and evaluates
optical connection losses along a cable link and locates any fiber breaks or faults.
