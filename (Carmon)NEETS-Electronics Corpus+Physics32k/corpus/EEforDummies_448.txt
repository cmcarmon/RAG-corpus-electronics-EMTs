How fast the capacitor charges (and discharges) depends on the resistance 
and capacitance of the RC circuit. The larger the resistance, the smaller the 
current that flows for the same supply voltage â€” and the longer it takes the 
capacitor to charge. A smaller resistance allows more current to flow, charg-
ing the capacitor faster.
