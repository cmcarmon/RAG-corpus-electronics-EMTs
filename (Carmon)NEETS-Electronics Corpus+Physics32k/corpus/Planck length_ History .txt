In 1899 Max Planck suggested that there existed some fundamental natural units for length, mass, time and energy. These he derived using dimensional analysis only using the Newton gravitational constant, the speed of light and the Planck constant. The natural units he derived has later been known as: the Planck length, the Planck mass, the Planck time and the Planck energy. The Planck units are among many physicists assumed to play a central role in a unified theory. For example the Planck length plays a central role in several suggested quantum gravity theories, such as the Loop quantum gravity theory. Also in string theory the Planck length plays a very central role as the length scale of strings is assumed to be on the order of the Planck length.
