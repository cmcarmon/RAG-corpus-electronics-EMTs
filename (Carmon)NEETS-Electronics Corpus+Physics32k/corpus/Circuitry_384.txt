Multi-stage amplifiers 
 
In order to provide sufficiently large values of gain, 
it  is  frequently  necessary  to  use  a  number  of 
interconnected  stages  within  an  amplifier.  The 
overall gain of an amplifier with several stages (i.e. 
a multi-stage amplifier) is simply the product of the 
individual voltage gains. Hence: 
 
AV = AV1 × AV2 × AV3  etc. 
 
Note, however, that the bandwidth of a multi-stage 
amplifier  will  be  less  than  the  bandwidth  of  each 
individual stage. In other words, an increase in gain 
can only be achieved at the expense of a reduction 
in bandwidth. 
  Signals  can  be  coupled  between  the  individual 
stages  of  a  multi-stage  amplifier  using  one  of  a 
number of different methods shown in Fig. 7.43.  
  The most commonly used method is that of R–C 
coupling as shown in Fig. 7.43(a). In this coupling 
method,  the  stages  are  coupled  together  using 
capacitors  having  a  low  reactance  at  the  signal 
frequency  and  resistors  (which  also  provide  a 
means  of  connecting  the  supply).  Figure  7.44 
shows a practical example of this coupling method.   
  A similar  coupling  method,  known  as  L–C 
coupling, is shown in Fig. 7.43(b). In this method, 
the  inductors  have  a  high  reactance  at  the  signal 
frequency.  This type of coupling is generally only 
used in RF and high-frequency amplifiers. 
  Two further methods, transformer coupling and 
direct  coupling  are  shown  in  Figures  7.43(c)  and 
7.43(d)  respectively.  The  latter  method  is  used 
where  d.c.  levels  present  on  signals  must  be 
preserved.
