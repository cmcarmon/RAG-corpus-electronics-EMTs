inﬁnity  in  the  s  plane.  The  root  loci  are  symmetrical  to  the  real  axis  of  the  s  plane,  since  the  pole-zero
conﬁguration of G(s)H(s) is symmetrical to the axis. The asymptotes of the two root loci that approach inﬁnity
are characterized by Eqs. (100.46) through (100.48). The angles of the asymptotes are:
