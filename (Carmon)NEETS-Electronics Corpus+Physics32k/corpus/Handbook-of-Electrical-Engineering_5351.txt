Crystalline Silicon
Silicon continues to be the foundation of the PV industry. The material is abundant, and Si solar cells have
demonstrated reliability in both space and terrestrial environments [Green, 1996]. Although the properties of
this  semiconductor  might  make  it  non-ideal  from  a  theoretical  view,  Si  solar  cells  have  reached  among  the
highest efﬁciencies among the PV material options. The evolution of the high-efﬁciency Si solar cell is illustrated
in the device cross sections shown in Fig. 60.9. The relatively simple, conventional p-n junction has given way
to  more  complicated  designs  and  structures  —  all  aimed  at  capturing  every  incident  photon,  maximizing
electron-hole  generation,  and  generating  maximum  currents.  This  has  called  for  improving  antireﬂection
approaches on the front surfaces, providing for multiple passes for the light, incorporating back surface electric
ﬁeld to reﬂect noncollected carriers, and minimizing obscuration of the incident light on the front surfaces.
The  evolution  of  these  designs  has  included  metal/insulator/n-type/p-type  (MINP),  passivated-emitter  solar
cells (PESC), single-sided and doubled-sided buried contact (SSBC and DSBC), point contact, and bifacial cells
(see [Green, 1996]). Efﬁciencies up to 24% have been veriﬁed with monocrystalline Si cells. It should be noted
that  although  performance  enhancement  is  attained  through  these  more  complex  designs,  there  is  also  a
potentially signiﬁcant increase in manufacturing cost.
