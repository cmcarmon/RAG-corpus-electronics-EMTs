The following table summarizes the different formulas commonly used in calculating the time value of money. These values are often displayed in tables where the interest rate and time are specified.
Notes:
A is a fixed payment amount, every period
G is a steadily increasing payment amount, that starts at G and increases by G for each subsequent period.
D is an exponentially or geometrically increasing payment amount, that starts at D and increases by a factor of (1+g) each subsequent period.
