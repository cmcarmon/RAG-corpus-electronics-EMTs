The video-signal spectrum generated by scanning an image
consists of energy concentrated near harmonics of the 15,734-
Hz line scanning frequency. Additional lower-amplitude side-
band components exist at multiples of 60 Hz (the ﬁeld scan
frequency)  from  each  line  scan  harmonic.  Substantially  no
energy exists halfway between the line scan harmonics, that
is, at odd harmonics of one half line frequency. Thus, these
blank spaces in the spectrum are available for the transmis-
sion of a signal for carrying color information and its side-
band. In addition, a signal modulated with color information
injected at this frequency is of relatively low visibility in the reproduced image because the odd harmonics are
of opposite phase on successive scanning lines and in successive frames, requiring four ﬁelds to repeat. Fur-
thermore, the visibility of the color video signal is reduced further by the use of a subcarrier frequency near
the cutoff of the video bandpass.
