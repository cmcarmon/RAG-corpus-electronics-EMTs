Consider a simple metallic substance. Most metals are crystalline in structure and consist of atoms
that are tightly bound in the lattice network. The atoms of such elements are so close together that the
electrons in the outer shell of the atom are associated with one atom as much as with its neighbor. (See
fig. 1-27 view A). As a result, the force of attachment of an outer electron with an individual atom is
practically zero. Depending on the metal, at least one electron, sometimes two, and in a few cases, three
electrons per atom exist in this state. In such a case, a relatively small amount of additional electron
energy would free the outer electrons from the attraction of the nucleus. At normal room temperature
materials of this type have many free electrons and are good conductors. Good conductors will have a low
resistance.
