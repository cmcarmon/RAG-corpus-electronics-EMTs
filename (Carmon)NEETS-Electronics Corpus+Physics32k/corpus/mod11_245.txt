The pn junction for the pnin diode, shown in figure 2-50, is strongly reverse biased to cause an 
avalanche in its depletion layer when the positive half cycle of a microwave signal is applied. The 
avalanche effect causes the electrons in the n region, which is very thin, to cross over to the intrinsic 
layer. The intrinsic layer is constructed so that the drift transit time causes the current to lag the signal 
voltage by more than 90 degrees at the desired frequency. Such a lag represents a negative resistance at 
the desired frequency. The pnin avalanche transit-time diode, when inserted in a microwave cavity with 
the proper dc bias, amplifies microwave signals introduced to the cavity.
