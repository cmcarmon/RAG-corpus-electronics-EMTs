There are several other types of diodes beside the junction diode. As the reverse voltage
increases the diode can avalanche-breakdown (zener breakdown). This causes an increase
in current in the reverse direction. Zener breakdown occurs when the electric ﬁeld near the
junction becomes large enough to excite valence electrons directly into the conduction band.
Avalanche breakdown is when the minority carriers are accelerated in the electric ﬁeld near
the junction to suﬃcient energies that they can excite valence electrons through collisions.
Figure 4.6 shows the current-voltage characteristic of a zener diode, its schematic symbol
and equivalent circuit model in the reverse-bias direction. The best zener diodes have a
breakdown voltage (VZ) of 6-7 V.
