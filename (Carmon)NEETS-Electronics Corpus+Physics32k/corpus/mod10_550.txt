approaches an infinite value, ER increases and approaches Ei in value. When RL is smaller than Z0, ER has
a negative value. This means that the reflected voltage is of opposite polarity to the incident wave at the
termination of the line. As RL approaches zero, ER approaches Ei in value. The smaller the value of ER, the
smaller is the peak amplitude of the standing waves and the higher are the minimum values.
