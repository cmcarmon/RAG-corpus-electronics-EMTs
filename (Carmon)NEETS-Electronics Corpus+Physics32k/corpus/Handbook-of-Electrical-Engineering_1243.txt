In what is to follow, we will be concerned with the task of optimally approximating a given matrix B ˛ C m · n
by  a  matrix  with  a  speciﬁc  linear  structure.  For  purposes  of  description,  the  speciﬁc  class  of  matrices  to  be
considered is denoted by + and its constituent matrices are functionally dependent on the real-valued parameter
vector u ˛ Rp. The matrix approximation problem is formally expressed as
