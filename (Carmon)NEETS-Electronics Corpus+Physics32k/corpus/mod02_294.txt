You know that in a direct current circuit the power is equal to the voltage times the current, or 
P = E × I. If a voltage of 100 volts applied to a circuit produces a current of 10 amperes, the power is 
1000 watts. This is also true in an ac circuit when the current and voltage are in phase; that is, when the 
circuit is effectively resistive. But, if the ac circuit contains reactance, the current will lead or lag the 
voltage by a certain amount (the phase angle). When the current is out of phase with the voltage, the 
power indicated by the product of the applied voltage and the total current gives only what is known as 
the APPARENT POWER. The TRUE POWER depends upon the phase angle between the current and 
voltage. The symbol for phase angle is ��(Theta).
