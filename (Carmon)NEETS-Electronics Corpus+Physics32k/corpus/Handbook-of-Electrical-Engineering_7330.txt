One of the main drawbacks of all the above types of phase detectors is that they only provide an output that
is proportional to phase and not to a frequency difference in the input signals. For many applications the PLL
input signals are initially not on the same frequency. Several techniques have been used in the past to resolve
this such as sweeping the VCO or using separate circuitry to Ô¨Årst acquire the input frequency. The sequential
(sometimes called phase/frequency) phase detector has become the most commonly used solution due to its
wide availability in integrated form. This type of phase detector produces pulses with the width of the pulses
indicating the phase difference of the inputs. It also has the characteristic of providing the correct output to
steer the VCO to the correct frequency. The noise characteristic of this type of phase detector is also quite good
since either no or very narrow pulses are produced when the inputs are in phase with each other. The phase
range of this type of circuit is
