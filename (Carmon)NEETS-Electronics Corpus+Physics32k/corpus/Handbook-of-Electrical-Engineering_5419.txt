The most common element of a three-phase power system is the overhead transmission line. The interconnec-
tion of these elements forms the major part of the power system network. The basic overhead transmission
lines consist of a group of phase conductors that transmit the electrical energy, the earth return, and usually
one or more neutral conductors (Fig. 61.1).
