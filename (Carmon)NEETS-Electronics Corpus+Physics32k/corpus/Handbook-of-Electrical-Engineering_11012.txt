Electromyography (EMG)
The electrical activity of skeletal muscle is monitored to assess the integrity of the motor nerve that supplies it
and to evaluate recovery of the motor nerve following injury to it. The EMG is also characteristically altered
in  many  degenerative  muscle  diseases.  Although  muscle  action  potentials  can  be  detected  with  skin-surface
electrodes, a monopolar or bipolar needle electrode is used in clinical EMG. The electrical activity is displayed
on an oscilloscope screen and monitored aurally with a loudspeaker.
