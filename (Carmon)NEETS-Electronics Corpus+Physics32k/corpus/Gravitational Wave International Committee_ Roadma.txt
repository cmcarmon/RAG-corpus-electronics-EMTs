In June 2010, GWIC released a document detailing a strategic roadmap for the gravitational wave astronomy field for the next 30 years [2]. This roadmap sets out recommended priorities for developing current projects and initiating new detectors based on scientific opportunities. The goal of the roadmap is to
serve the international gravitational wave community and its stake-holders as a tool for the development of capabilities and facilities needed to address the exciting scientific opportunities on the intermediate and long-term horizons.
