The following formula use these common variables:
PV is the value at time=0 (present value)
FV is the value at time=n (future value)
A is the value of the individual payments in each compounding period
n is the number of periods (not necessarily an integer)
i is the interest rate at which the amount compounds each period
g is the growing rate of payments over each time period
