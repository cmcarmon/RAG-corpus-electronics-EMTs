As the Weber number increases, the drop deformation upon impact also increases. The drop deformation pattern can be split up into regimes based on the Weber number.
At We << 1, there is not significant deformation.
For We on the order of 1, the drop experiences significant deformation, and flattens somewhat on the surface.
When We ~ 4, waves form on the drop.
When We ~ 18, satellite droplet(s) break off of the drop, which is now an elongated vertical column.
For large We (for which the magnitude depends on the specific surface structure), many satellite drops break off during spreading and/or retraction of the drop.
