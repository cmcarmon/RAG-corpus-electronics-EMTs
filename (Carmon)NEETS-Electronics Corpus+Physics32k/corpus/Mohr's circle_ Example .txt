Assume a material element under a state of stress as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, with the plane of one of its sides oriented 10° with respect to the horizontal plane. Using the Mohr circle, find:
The orientation of their planes of action.
The maximum shear stresses and orientation of their planes of action.
The stress components on a horizontal plane.
Check the answers using the stress transformation formulas or the stress transformation law.
Solution: Following the engineering mechanics sign convention for the physical space (Figure 5), the stress components for the material element in this example are:

{\displaystyle \sigma _{x'}=-10{\textrm {MPa}}}

{\displaystyle \tau _{x'y'}=40{\textrm {MPa}}}
.
Following the steps for drawing the Mohr circle for this particular state of stress, we first draw a Cartesian coordinate system

)


{\displaystyle (\sigma _{\mathrm {n} },\tau _{\mathrm {n} })}
with the

{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {n} }}
-axis upward.
We then plot two points A(50,40) and B(-10,-40), representing the state of stress at plane A and B as show in both Figure 8 and Figure 9. These points follow the engineering mechanics sign convention for the Mohr-circle space (Figure 5), which assumes positive normals stresses outward from the material element, and positive shear stresses on each plane rotating the material element clockwise. This way, the shear stress acting on plane B is negative and the shear stress acting on plane A is positive. The diameter of the circle is the line joining point A and B. The centre of the circle is the intersection of this line with the




σ


n





{\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {n} }}
-axis. Knowing both the location of the centre and length of the diameter, we are able to plot the Mohr circle for this particular state of stress.
The abscissas of both points E and C (Figure 8 and Figure 9) intersecting the




σ


n





{\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {n} }}
-axis are the magnitudes of the minimum and maximum normal stresses, respectively; the ordinates of both points E and C are the magnitudes of the shear stresses acting on both the minor and major principal planes, respectively, which is zero for principal planes.
Even though the idea for using the Mohr circle is to graphically find different stress components by actually measuring the coordinates for different points on the circle, it is more convenient to confirm the results analytically. Thus, the radius and the abscissa of the centre of the circle are

The coordinates for both points H and G (Figure 8 and Figure 9) are the magnitudes of the minimum and maximum shear stresses, respectively; the abscissas for both points H and G are the magnitudes for the normal stresses acting on the same planes where the minimum and maximum shear stresses act, respectively. The magnitudes of the minimum and maximum shear stresses can be found analytically by

We can choose to either use the double angle approach (Figure 8) or the Pole approach (Figure 9) to find the orientation of the principal normal stresses and principal shear stresses.
Using the double angle approach we measure the angles ∠BOC and ∠BOE in the Mohr Circle (Figure 8) to find double the angle the major principal stress and the minor principal stress make with plane B in the physical space. To obtain a more accurate value for these angles, instead of manually measuring the angles, we can use the analytical expression

One solution is:

{\displaystyle 2\theta _{p}=-53.13^{\circ }}

Remember that in this particular example

{\displaystyle \theta _{p1}}

{\displaystyle \theta _{p2}}
are angles with respect to the plane of action of

Using the Pole approach, we first localize the Pole or origin of planes. For this, we draw through point A on the Mohr circle a line inclined 10° with the horizontal, or, in other words, a line parallel to plane A where




σ


y
′





{\displaystyle \sigma _{y'}}
acts. The Pole is where this line intersects the Mohr circle (Figure 9). To confirm the location of the Pole, we could draw a line through point B on the Mohr circle parallel to the plane B where




σ


x
′





{\displaystyle \sigma _{x'}}
acts. This line would also intersect the Mohr circle at the Pole (Figure 9).
From the Pole, we draw lines to different points on the Mohr circle. The coordinates of the points where these lines intersect the Mohr circle indicate the stress components acting on a plane in the physical space having the same inclination as the line. For instance, the line from the Pole to point C in the circle has the same inclination as the plane in the physical space where




σ

1




{\displaystyle \sigma _{1}}
acts. This plane makes an angle of 63.435° with plane B, both in the Mohr-circle space and in the physical space. In the same way, lines are traced from the Pole to points E, D, F, G and H to find the stress components on planes with the same orientation.
