Another piece of test equipment used is the SPECTRUM ANALYZER. This test equipment is used
to sweep over a band of frequencies to determine what frequencies are being produced by a specific
circuit under test, and then the amplitude of each frequency component. An accurate interpretation of the
display will allow you to determine the efficiency of the equipment being tested.
