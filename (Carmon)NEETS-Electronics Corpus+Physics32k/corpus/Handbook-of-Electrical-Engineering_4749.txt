As  shown  in  Table 49.1,  there  are  two  dominant  classes  of  ferroelectric  materials,  ceramics  and  organics.
Both classes have important applications of their piezoelectric properties. To exploit the ferroelectric property,

recently a large effort has been devoted to producing thin Ô¨Ålms of 
substrates  for  silicon-based  memory  chips  for  nonvolatile  storage.  In  these  devices,  data  is  retained  in  the
Organic materials have not been used for their
absence of external power as positive and negative 
ferroelectric properties. Liquid crystals in display applications are used for their ability to rotate the plane of
polarization of light and not their ferroelectric attribute.
