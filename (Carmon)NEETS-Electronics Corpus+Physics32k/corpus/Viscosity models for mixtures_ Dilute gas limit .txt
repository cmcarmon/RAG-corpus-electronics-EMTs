Zéberg-Mikkelsen (2001) proposed an empirical model for dilute gas viscosity of fairly spherical molecules as follows





η

=

d

g

T


+

d

g

T


d

g

{\displaystyle \eta _{0}=d_{g1}{\sqrt {T}}+d_{g2}T^{d_{g3}}}

or





η

=

g

D

D

g

{\displaystyle \eta _{0}=D_{g1}{\sqrt {T_{r}}}+D_{g2}T_{r}^{D_{g3}}}






D

g

=

d

T

and



D

=

d

g

⋅

T

c



d

g

and



D

g

=

d

g

{\displaystyle D_{g1}=d_{g1}\cdot {\sqrt {T_{c}}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad D_{g2}=d_{g2}\cdot T_{c}^{d_{g3}}\quad {\text{and}}\quad D_{g3}=d_{g3}}

The unit equations for viscosity and temperature are





[

η

]

=
μ
P


and



[
T
]

=
K


{\displaystyle \left[\eta _{0}\right]=\mu P\quad {\text{and}}\quad \left[T\right]=K}

The second term is a correction term for high temperatures. Note that most

{\displaystyle d_{g2}}
parameters are negative.
