the avalanche breakdown of the gate-to-channel pn junction. When  VGS = 0, this occurs at VDS = BVDS = BVDG.
Since VDG = VDS – VGS and breakdown occurs when VDG = BVDG , as VGS increases the breakdown voltage decreases,
as given by BVDG = BVDS – VGS . Thus BVDS = BVDG + VGS. For example, if the gate-to-channel breakdown voltage
is 50 V, the VDS breakdown voltage will start off at 50 V when VGS = 0 but decrease to 46 V when VGS = –4 V.
