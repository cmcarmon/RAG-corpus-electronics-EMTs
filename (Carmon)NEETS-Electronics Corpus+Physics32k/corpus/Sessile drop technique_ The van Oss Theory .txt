The van Oss theory separates the surface energy of solids and liquids into three components. It includes the dispersive surface energy, as before, and subdivides the polar component as being the sum of two more specific components: the surface energy due to acidic interactions (




σ

+




{\displaystyle \sigma ^{+}}
) and due to basic interactions (




σ

−




{\displaystyle \sigma ^{-}}
). The acid component theoretically describes a surface’s propensity to have polar interactions with a second surface that has the ability to act basic by donating electrons. Conversely, the base component of the surface energy describes the propensity of a surface to have polar interactions with another surface that acts acidic by accepting electrons. The principle equation for this theory is:

Again, the best way to deal with this theory, much like the two component theories, is to use at least three liquids (more can be used to get more results for statistical purposes) – one with only a dispersive component to its surface energy (

{\displaystyle \sigma _{L}=\sigma _{L}^{D}}
), one with only a dispersive and an acidic or basic component (

{\displaystyle \sigma _{L}=\sigma _{L}^{D}+\sigma _{L}^{\pm }}
), and finally either a liquid with a dispersive and a basic or acidic component (whichever the second probe liquid did not have (

{\displaystyle \sigma _{L}=\sigma _{L}^{D}+\sigma _{L}^{\mp }}
