Messy wiring makes it difficult to debug a circuit, and a tangle of wires greatly 
increases the chance of mistakes. Wires pull out when you donâ€™t want them 
to, or the circuit can malfunction. To avoid chaos, carefully plan and con-
struct your breadboard circuits. The extra effort can save you lots of time 
and frustration down the road.
