There are two main types of sakia. One type consist of a vertical wheel which is slung with an endless belt or chain of buckets. The buckets hang down into a well which may be up to 8 m (26 ft) deep.
The second type has the buckets or other water containers attached directly to the vertical wheel.
The most primitive sakias are driven by donkeys, mules, or oxen. The animal turns a horizontal wheel, which is engaged with the vertical wheel and so causes it to turn. This causes the buckets of the first type to circulate and lift up water from a deeper well, or with the second type, it causes the vertical wheel to rotate and scoop up water from a less deep well.
In Spanish an animal-driven sakia is named ace√±a, with the exception of the Cartagena area, where it is called a noria de sangre, or "waterwheel of blood".
In terms of propulsion, there is a different, much rarer type of sakia which uses the same general technique, but it is driven by wind. The wind-driven sakias in the vicinity of Cartagena, Spain, are virtually identical in appearance with the local grinding mills.
