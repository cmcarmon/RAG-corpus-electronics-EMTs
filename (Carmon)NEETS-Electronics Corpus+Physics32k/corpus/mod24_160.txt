Multimode fibers also have some disadvantages. As the number of modes increases, the effect of
modal dispersion increases. Modal dispersion (intermodal dispersion) means that modes arrive at the fiber
end at slightly different times. This time difference causes the light pulse to spread. Modal dispersion
affects system bandwidth. Fiber manufacturers adjust the core diameter, NA, and index profile properties
of multimode fibers to maximize system bandwidth.
