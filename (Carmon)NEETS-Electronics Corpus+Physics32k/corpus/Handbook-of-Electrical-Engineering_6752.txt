Specialized LAN Services
LAN  users  have  special  communication  requirements  that  must  be  supported  by  the  physical  and  data  link
layers.  In  particular,  the  MAC  sublayer  is  responsible  for  providing  specialized  services.  Although  all  MAC
sublayers support asynchronous trafﬁc by providing for the simple, best-effort delivery of packets, some MAC
sublayers also support other classes of trafﬁc. To synchronous trafﬁc, which requires a set amount of preallocated
bandwidth, the properly designed MAC sublayer guarantees a maximum packet response time. The adaptively
timed token-passing protocol of FDDI is capable of supporting synchronous trafﬁc, i.e., at token-capture time
the  station  has  a  ﬁxed  amount  of  time  during  which  to  transmit  synchronous  packets,  and  the  token  is
guaranteed to return within a certain amount of time. Isochronous trafﬁc, which requires a ﬁxed amount of
trafﬁc  to  be  periodically  delivered,  is  also  accommodated  by  some  MAC  sublayers.  DQDB  uses  preallocated
time slots to provide isochronous service.
