HVAC Illustration
In order to demonstrate the ability of the neural identiﬁcation and control schemes to handle disturbances and
changes in nonlinear plant dynamics, a Heat, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system where a thermal
load is added and the actual output vs. the commanded output of each actuator is modiﬁed. The neural observers
are adapted at each time step in one simulation, while adaptation of the observers is stopped at time step k =
200  in  another  simulation.  Both  simulations  are  performed  for  1000  time  steps.  The  reference  trajectory  is
plotted in Fig. 100.65, along with the output of the system that uses nonadaptive identiﬁers after time step k =
200. Tracking errors for both simulations are plotted in Fig. 100.66, where T3 is the temperature to be controlled
and r is the reference signal to be tracked.
