History of black holes
Timeline of black hole physics – Timeline of black hole physics
John Michell – geologist who first proposed the idea "dark stars" in 1783Dark star

Pierre-Simon Laplace – early mathematical theorist (1796) of the idea of black holes
Albert Einstein – in 1915, arrived at the theory of general relativity
Karl Schwarzschild – described the gravitational field of a point mass in 1915
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar – in 1931, using special relativity, postulated that a non-rotating body of electron-degenerate matter above a certain limiting mass (now called the Chandrasekhar limit at 1.4 solar masses) has no stable solutions.
David Finkelstein – identified the Schwarzschild surface as an event horizon
Roy Kerr – In 1963, found the exact solution for a rotating black hole
