Transmitters
Standards that cover AM broadcast transmitters are given in the Electronic Industry Association (EIA) Standard
TR-101A, “Electrical Performance Standard for Standard Broadcast Transmitters.” Parameters and methods for
measurement  include  the  following:  carrier  output  rating,  carrier  power  output  capability,  carrier  frequency
range, carrier frequency stability, carrier shift, carrier noise level, magnitude of radio frequency (RF)harmonics,
normal load, transmitter output circuit adjustment facilities, RF and audio interface deﬁnitions, modulation
capability,  audio  input  level  for  100%  modulation,  audio  frequency  response,  audio  frequency  harmonic
distortion, rated power supply, power supply variation, operating temperature characteristics, and power input.
Standard AM broadcast transmitters range in power output from 5 W up to 50 kW units. While solid-state
devices are used for many models (especially the lower-powered units), several manufacturers still retain tubes
in the ﬁnal ampliﬁers of their high-powered models. This is changing, however, with the introduction in recent
years of 50-kW fully transistorized models. A block diagram of a typical 1-kW solid-state transmitter is shown
in Fig. 69.11.
