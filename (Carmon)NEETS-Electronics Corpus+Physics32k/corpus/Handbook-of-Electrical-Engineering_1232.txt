With these thoughts in mind, we will now consider the generic problem of ﬁnding a positive-semideﬁnite
matrix  that  lies  closest  to  a  given  Hermitian  matrix  A ˛  C n ·  n.  In  those  applications  where  matrix A  is  not
Hermitian, then this matrix is ﬁrst replaced by its Hermitian component as deﬁned by (A + A*)/2 and then
the closest positive-semideﬁnite matrix to this Hermitian component is found.8 The problem at hand is readily
solved by ﬁrst making an eigenanalysis of the Hermitian matrix A, that is,
