A moving-disk frequency meter is shown in figure 1-48. One coil tends to turn the disk clockwise,
and the other, counterclockwise. Magnetizing coil A is connected in series with a large value of
resistance. Coil B is connected in series with a large inductance and the two circuits are supplied in
parallel by the source.
