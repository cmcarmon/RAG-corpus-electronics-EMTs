When the instrument is used as a dc differential voltmeter, the MODE and NULL SENS switches in
figure 4-16 are placed to their respective +/ -  dc and desired full-scale meter sensitivity positions. In this
mode of operation, the NULL SENS switch selects a suitable resistance value to determine the full-scale
sensitivity of the meter. The dc input voltage applied to the instrument is then compared with the null
detector, and any resulting difference is used to drive the meter. The meter terminals can be reversed
through the contacts of the MODE switch for +/ -  dc voltage measurements.
