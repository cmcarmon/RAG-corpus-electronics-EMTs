The ion implantation planar process technology is well suited for mass production of wafer sizes compatible
with the rest of the silicon industry. Minimum wafer diameters are now 4 in. or 5 in. At this diameter, breakage
during  fabrication  is  an  issue  for  thicknesses  less  than  150 µ.  For  thicknesses  over  500 µ,  the  availability  of
enough  sufﬁciently  pure  material  to  justify  the  cost  of  photolithographic  masks  is  an  issue.  Ion-implanted
detectors can be baked at 200°C to reduce outgassing. This is a signiﬁcant improvement over surface barrier
detectors, which irreversibly degrade by device processing above room temperature. This is a useful feature as
most heavy charged particle spectroscopy is done in a vacuum.
