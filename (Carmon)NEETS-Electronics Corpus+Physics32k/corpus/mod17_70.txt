Reference designations consist of letters, numbers, or both and are used for identification purposes. 
Reference designations can be used in several different ways. One important way you will use them is as 
a cross-reference for locating supply stock numbers. When you know the reference designator, ordering 
the correct replacement for a failed component is easy. You will also use them frequently in corrective 
and preventive maintenance. Reference designators will help you to locate test points and adjustments; 
they will also help you to move back and forth between various technical manuals, schematics, tables, or 
other references.
