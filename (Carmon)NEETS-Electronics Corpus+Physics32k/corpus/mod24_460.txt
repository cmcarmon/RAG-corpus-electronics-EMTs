End users routinely perform optical fiber measurements to measure fiber power loss and fiber
information capacity. End users may also perform optical fiber measurements to measure fiber
geometrical properties. Optical fiber power loss measurements include attenuation and cutoff wavelength.
Optical fiber information capacity measurements include chromatic dispersion and bandwidth. Fiber
geometrical measurements include cladding diameter, core diameter, numerical aperture, and mode field
diameter. Optical connection measurements performed by end users in the laboratory include insertion
loss and reflectance or return loss.
