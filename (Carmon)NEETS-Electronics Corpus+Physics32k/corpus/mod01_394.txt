For a battery to work properly, its electrolyte (water plus active ingredient) must contain a certain 
amount of active ingredient. Since the active ingredient is dissolved in the water, the amount  of active 
ingredient cannot be measured directly. An indirect way to determine whether or not the electrolyte 
contains the proper amount of active ingredient is to measure the electrolyte's specific gravity. Specific 
gravity is the ratio of the weight of a certain amount of a given substance compared to the weight of the 
same amount of pure water. The specific gravity of pure water is 1.0. Any substance that floats has a 
specific gravity less than 1.0. Any substance that sinks has a specific gravity greater than 1.0.
