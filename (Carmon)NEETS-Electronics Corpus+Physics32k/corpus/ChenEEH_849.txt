2 Section 4.2 later shows that it is more appropriate to refer to the permis-
sible range of a sequentially adjacent pair of registers. There may be more than
one local data path between the same pair of registers, but circuit performance
is ultimately determined by the permissible ranges of the clock skew between
pairs of registers.
