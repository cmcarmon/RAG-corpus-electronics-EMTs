Active and passive microwave devices and components are the
essential building blocks of microwave circuits and systems
that operate in the frequency range from 300 MHz to
300 GHz (corresponding to wavelengths of 1 m to 1 mm in
free space). This chapter only presents passive components
that are composed of lumped or distributed elements or a
combination of both. At lower frequencies (e.g., 300 MHzâ€“
10 GHz), the emphasis is on lumped elements to keep circuit
dimensions small. At higher frequencies, the quality of lumped
elements deteriorates rapidly, and mostly distributed elements
are employed. Microwave circuits are a combination of passive
