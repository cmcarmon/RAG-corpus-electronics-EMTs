The stator coils of three-phase alternators may be joined together in either wye or delta connections,
as shown in figure 3-9. With these connections only three wires come out of the alternator. This allows
convenient connection to three-phase motors or power distribution transformers. It is necessary to use
three-phase transformers or their electrical equivalent with this type of system.
