The series system is best thought of as a system that contains no redundancy; that is, each element of the
system is needed to make the system function correctly. In general, a system may contain N elements, and in
a series system each of the N elements is required for the system to function correctly. The reliability of the
series system can be calculated as the probability that none of the elements will fail. Another way to look at
this is that the reliability of the series system is the probability that all of the elements are working properly.
The reliability of a series system is given by
