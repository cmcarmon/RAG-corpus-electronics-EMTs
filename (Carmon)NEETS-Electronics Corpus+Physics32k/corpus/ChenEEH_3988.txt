In the previous section, an n-level nested Do-loop can be
regarded as a terminating program. In this section, a nonter-
minating recurrent program is taken into consideration.
Examples of this kind of algorithm include IIR and adaptive
ﬁlters. These algorithms are characterized by a current output
that is deﬁned by a given function of the previous outputs and
the current input. As such, the validity of the output depends
on how often its computation is initiated, called the initiation
period. Two optimization techniques loop unfolding and
look-ahead transformation are discussed next.
