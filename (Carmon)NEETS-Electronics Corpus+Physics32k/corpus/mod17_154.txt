Figure 2-2 is a block diagram of the input and output powers for each stage of a typical medium-
power transmitter. You should be able to see that the power output of a transmitter can be increased by
adding amplifier stages capable of delivering the power required. In our example, the .5 watt output of the
buffer is amplified in the first intermediate amplifier by a factor of 10, (this is a times 10 [ ·  10] amplifier)
giving us an input of 5 watts to the second intermediate amplifier. You can see in this example the second
intermediate amplifier multiplies the 5 watt input to it by a factor of 5 ( ·  5) and gives us a 25 watt input to
our power (final) amplifier. The final amplifier multiplies its input by a factor of 20 ( ·  20) and gives us
500 watts of power out to the antenna.
