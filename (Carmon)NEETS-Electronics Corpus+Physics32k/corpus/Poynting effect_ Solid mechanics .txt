In solid mechanics, the Poynting effect is a large strain effect observed when an elastic cube is sheared between two plates and stress is developed in the direction normal to the sheared faces, or when a cylinder is subjected to torsion and the axial length changes. The Poynting phenomenon in torsion was noticed experimentally by J. H. Poynting.
