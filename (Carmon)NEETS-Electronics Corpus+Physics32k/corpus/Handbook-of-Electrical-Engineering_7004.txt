Communication Channels
The communication channel is the set of devices and systems that connects the transmitter to the receiver. The
transmitter and receiver consist of an encoder and decoder, respectively, which translate the information stream
produced by the source into a signal suitable for channel transmission and vice versa (Fig. 73.13). For example,
in the case of the telephone line, two communication channels (one in each direction) share the same physical
channel that connects the two modems. That physical channel usually consists of twisted copper wires at both
ends and a variety of switching and signal processing operations that occur at the telephone exchanges. The
modems themselves are not included in the communication channel. A microwave radio link is another example
of a communication channel that consists of an ampliÔ¨Åer and an antenna (at both ends) and a certain portion
of  the  radio  spectrum.  In  this  case,  the  communication  channel  model  does  not  fully  correspond  with  the
physical channel. Why not, for example, view the antenna as part of the transmitter rather than the channel
