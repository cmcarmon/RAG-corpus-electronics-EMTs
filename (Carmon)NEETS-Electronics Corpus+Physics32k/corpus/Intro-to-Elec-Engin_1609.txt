to get rated voltage across the motor terminals.
to α = 60° and Ta = 25 N·m assuming continuous conduction.
(c) Let the motor drive a load whose torque is constant and independent of speed. The
minimum value of the load torque is 1.2 N·m. Calculate the inductance that must be
added to the armature circuit to get continuous conduction for all operating points,
−1(ωLa/Ra) = 1.5 rad, Tan > 0.006, and all points on the
given that ψ = tan
Tan–ωmn plane lie to the right of the boundary between continuous and discontinuous
conductions.
