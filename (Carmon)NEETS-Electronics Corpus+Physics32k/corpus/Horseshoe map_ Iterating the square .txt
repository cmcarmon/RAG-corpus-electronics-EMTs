Under forward iterations of the horseshoe map, the original square gets mapped into a series of horizontal strips. The points in these horizontal strips come from vertical strips in the original square. Let S0 be the original square, map it forward n times, and consider only the points that fall back into the square S0, which is a set of horizontal stripes

which are the horizontal strips Hn mapped backwards n times. That is, a point in Vn will, under n iterations of the horseshoe, end up in the set Hn of vertical strips.
