The simple PI-type controller satisﬁes the conservative performance speciﬁcations for the cases tested, but
does not always use its resources efﬁciently. For example, if the outside air temperature of the HVAC system is
close to the steady-state reference temperature, it may be more efﬁcient to increase the room volumetric ﬂow
rate for a period of time in order to reduce the amount of heating or cooling performed by the heat exchanger.
The  neural  and  PI-type  control  schemes  are  tested  using  initial  conditions T3(0) =  15°C,  a  constant  outside
temperature of 22°C, and a steady-state reference value of 20°C. The tracking errors and heat exchanger outputs
for both methods are shown in Figs. 100.68 and 100.69, respectively.
