The patch antenna has several desirable qualities, including a
broadside radiation pattern that allows it to be integrated into
two-dimensional arrays. The antenna is also low proÔ¨Åle and
low cost, has good conformability, and has ease of manufac-
turing. It is readily integrated with microstrip or coaxial probe
feeding. Multilayer schemes have been used for other types of
feeding, including CPW and strip line. With microstrip feed-
ing, it is also a relatively simple task to implement either linear
or circular polarization excitation of the antenna.
