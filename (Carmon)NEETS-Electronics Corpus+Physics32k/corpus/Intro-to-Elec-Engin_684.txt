While there is no difference in the general shape of the characteristics between the depletion
and enhancement MOSFETs, the practical distinction is the gate voltage range. In particular, a
depletion MOSFET can be in the active region when vGS = 0, whereas an enhancement MOSFET
must have vGS > VT > 0.
