The antenna is a rubber covered, omnidirectional, flexible whip antenna that is 7.74 inches long. The 
batteries supplied with the radio set are lithium D cells. Each cell is fused to protect against damage from 
external short circuits. Two cells are installed in the transceiver and four are packaged as spares.
