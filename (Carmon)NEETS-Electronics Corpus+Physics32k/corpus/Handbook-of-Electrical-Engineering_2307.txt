Zener and Avalanche Diodes
Zener diodes (ZD) and avalanche diodes are pn-diodes specially built to operate in reverse breakdown. They
operate in the reverse direction; however, their operating mechanism is different. In a Zener diode the hole–elec-
tron  pairs  are  generated  by  the  electric  ﬁeld  by  direct  transition  of  carriers  from  valence  band  into  the
conductance band. In an avalanche diode, the hole–electron pairs are generated by impact ionization due to
high-energy holes and electrons.
