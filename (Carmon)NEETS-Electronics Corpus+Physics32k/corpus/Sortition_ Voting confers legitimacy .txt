Those who see voting as expressing the "consent of the governed", maintain that voting is able to confer legitimacy in the selection. According to this view, elected officials can act with greater authority than when randomly selected. With no popular mandate to draw on, randomly-selected politicians lose a moral basis on which to base their authority. As such, politicians would be open to charges of illegitimacy, as they were selected purely by chance.
Moreover, the logistical constraints of sortition and deliberation encourage that governing bodies be kept small, limiting participation. Since it is statistically unlikely that a given individual will participate in the deliberative body, sortition creates two groups of people, the few randomly-chosen politicians and the masses. Identifying the source of sortition's legitimacy has proven difficult. As a result, advocates of sortition have suggest limiting the use cases of sortition to serving as consultative or political agenda-setting bodies.
