where w = 1.266, which compares with an exact solution value of 1.254, and a = 1.91. For the oscillation with
the  ideal  relay,  Eq.  (100.123)  with  Ni g(a)  =  2h/ap  shows  that  the  limit  cycle  is  stable.  This  agrees  with  the
perturbation approach which also shows that the limit cycle is stable when the relay has hysteresis.
