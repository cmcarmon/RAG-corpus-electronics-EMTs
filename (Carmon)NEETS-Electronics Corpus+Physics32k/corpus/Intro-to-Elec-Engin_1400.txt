Unlike transmission lines, which operate at any frequency up to a cutoff value, waveguides
have both upper and lower cutoff frequencies. For rectangular air-ﬁlled waveguides [see Figure
15.1.2(a)], the lower cutoff frequency (for propagation by the dominant mode) is given by
fc = c/2a, where c is the speed of light. Since the upper limit cannot be larger than 2fc, practical
waveguides are designed with b ∼= a/2 with a suggested frequency of 1.25fc ≤ f ≤ 1.9fc. For a
circular air-ﬁlled waveguide [see Figure 15.1.2(b)] with inside radius a, the lower cutoff frequency
(for propagation by the dominant mode) is fc = 0.293c/a. The operating band is usually fc < f
< 1.307fc. The characteristic impedance ¯Z0(= R0) in waveguides is not constant with frequency,
¯Z0(= R0) is given by
