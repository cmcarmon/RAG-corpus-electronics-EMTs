  load  resistors  of  very  high  resistance  value  in  place  of  the  two  P-channel
transistors shown in Fig. 80.4(b). Most are full CMOS designs like the one shown. Sometimes the P-channel
transistors are constructed by thin Ô¨Ålm techniques and are physically placed over the N-channel transistors to
improve density. When both P- and N-channel transistors are fabricated in the same plane of the single-crystal
semiconductor, the standby current can be extremely low. Typically this can be microamps for megabit chips.
The low standby current is possible because each cell sources and sinks only that current needed to overcome
the actual node leakage within the cell.
