Conventional beamforming deals with the design of ﬁxed beam patterns for given speciﬁcations. Optimum
beamforming is the design of beam patterns to meet a speciﬁed optimization criterion. It can be compared to
optimum ﬁltering, detection, and estimation. Adaptive beamformers sense their operating environment (for
example, noise covariance matrix) and adjust beamformer parameters so that their performance is optimized
[Monzingo and Miller, 1980]. Adaptive beamformers can be compared with adaptive ﬁlters.
