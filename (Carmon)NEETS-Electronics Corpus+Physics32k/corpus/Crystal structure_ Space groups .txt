In addition to the operations of the point group, the space group of the crystal structure contains translational symmetry operations. These include:
Pure translations, which move a point along a vector
Screw axes, which rotate a point around an axis while translating parallel to the axis.
Glide planes, which reflect a point through a plane while translating it parallel to the plane.
There are 230 distinct space groups.
