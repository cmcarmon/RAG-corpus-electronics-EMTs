Charge leakage noise is mainly composed of subthreshold
conduction in nominally off transistors. This current can
either charge/discharge a dynamic node or cause the stable
state of a weakly held node to be signiﬁcantly different from
rails. This is mainly a concern for wide domino NOR, PLA,
and memory arrays. This current rises exponentially with
reduction in the threshold voltage and is becoming very sig-
niﬁcant in DSM. It is helped greatly by feedback devices.
