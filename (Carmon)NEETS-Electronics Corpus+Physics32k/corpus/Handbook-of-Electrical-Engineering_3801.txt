Although  waveguide  modes  are  not  plane  waves,  the  ratio  of  their  transverse  electric  and  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld
magnitudes  is  constant  throughout  the  cross  section  of  the  waveguide,  just  as  for  plane  waves.  This  ratio  is
called the modal wave impedance and has the following values for TE and TM modes:
