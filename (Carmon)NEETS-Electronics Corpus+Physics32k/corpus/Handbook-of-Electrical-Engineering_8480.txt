Conditional-Sum Addition
Another one of the fast schemes for addition of two numbers that predates CLA is conditional-sum addition
(CSA) proposed by Sklansky [1960] in 1960. The essence of the CSA scheme is the realization that we can add
two  numbers  without  waiting  for  the  carry  signal  to  be  available.  Simply,  the  number  were  added  in  two
instances: one assuming Cin = 0 and the other assuming Cin = 1. The results: Sum0, Sum1 and Carry0, Carry1
are  presented  at  the  input  of  a  multiplexer.  The  ﬁnal  values  are  being  selected  at  the  time  Cin  arrives  at  the
“select” input of a multiplexer. As in CLA the input bits are divided into groups which are added “conditionally”.
It  is  apparent  that  starting  from  the  least  signiﬁcant  bit  (LSB)  position  the  hardware  complexity  starts  to
