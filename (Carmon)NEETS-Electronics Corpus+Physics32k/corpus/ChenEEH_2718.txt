With the systems of ﬁnite-difference expressions of equa-
tions 9.19 and 9.20, the new value of an electromagnetic ﬁeld
vector component at any space lattice point depends only on
its previous value, the previous values of the components of
the other ﬁeld vector at adjacent points, and the known electric
and magnetic current sources. Therefore, at any given time
step, the computation of a ﬁeld vector can proceed either one
point at a time, or,
if p parallel processors are employed
concurrently, p points at a time.
