Modal dispersion is the dominant source of dispersion in multimode fibers. Modal dispersion does
not exist in single mode fibers. Single mode fibers propagate only the fundamental mode. Therefore,
single mode fibers exhibit the lowest amount of total dispersion. Single mode fibers also exhibit the
highest possible bandwidth.
