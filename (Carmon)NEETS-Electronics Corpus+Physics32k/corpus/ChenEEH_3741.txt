A ﬁnal issue of signiﬁcance in the use of DTW is the devel-
opment of an appropriate set of reference strings—the so-called
training problem. DTW training is a problem to which there is
no simple or well-formulated solution, and this fact represents
one of the central contrasts between the DTW method and the
pervasive HMM approach. Unlike the DTW reference models,
the HMM can be trained in a ‘‘supervised’’ paradigm in which
the model can learn the statistical makeup of the exemplars.
The application of the HMM to speech recognition in the 1980s
was a revolutionary development, largely because of the super-
vised training aspect of the model. For more information on
DTW training, see Deller et al. (2000).
