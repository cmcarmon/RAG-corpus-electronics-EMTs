tion can be maximized via a systematic and seamless integra-
tion of hardware cores, operating systems, and application
softwares. Throughout the 70s, microprogramming computer
architecture design was the most dominant approach, and it
had a fundamental inﬂuence on early development of comput-
ing systems. In general, the hierarchy of systems using micro-
programming is divided into application softwares, operating
systems, machine language, microprogramming, and physical
devices. Since the early 80s, the ever-increasing processing
power offered by VLSI technology (as governed by the Moore’s
law) has fundamentally changed the computer design concept.
The popularity of reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
has virtually eliminated the need for microprogramming.
More generally, computer architectures have undergone a
rapid change driven by the VLSI, deep-submicron, and nano-
scale device technologies.
