Floppy disks, also known as ﬂexible disks, are the low-cost, medium-capacity, nonvolatile
memory devices made of soft ﬂexible mylar plastic with magnetically sensitive iron-oxide coating.
The original 8-in standard ﬂoppy is no longer in popular use. The 5 1/4-in miniﬂoppy has a disk
and a disk jacket covering the mylar media for protection, along with a write-protect notch and
index hole. The present-day miniﬂoppy disks are either double-sided/double-density (DS/DD)
with 9 sectors per track and 40 tracks per side or double-sided/quad-density (DS/QD) with 9 or
15 sectors per track and 80 tracks per side. In a DS/DD miniﬂoppy disk, about 720 kbytes of data
can be stored; whereas in a DS/QD mini-ﬂoppy disk, about 1–2 Mbytes of data can be stored.
