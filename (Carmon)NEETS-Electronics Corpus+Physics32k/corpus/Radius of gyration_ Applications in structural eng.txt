In structural engineering, the two-dimensional radius of gyration is used to describe the distribution of cross sectional area in a column around its centroidal axis with the mass of the body. The radius of gyration is given by the following formula:





R


g



2


=


I
A




{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {g} }^{2}={\frac {I}{A}}}

or





R


g



=



I
A





{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {g} }={\sqrt {\frac {I}{A}}}}

Where I is the second moment of area and A is the total cross-sectional area.
The gyration radius is useful in estimating the stiffness of a column. If the principal moments of the two-dimensional gyration tensor are not equal, the column will tend to buckle around the axis with the smaller principal moment. For example, a column with an elliptical cross-section will tend to buckle in the direction of the smaller semiaxis.
It also can be referred to as the radial distance from a given axis at which the mass of a body could be concentrated without altering the rotational inertia of the body about that axis.
In engineering, where continuous bodies of matter are generally the objects of study, the radius of gyration is usually calculated as an integral.
