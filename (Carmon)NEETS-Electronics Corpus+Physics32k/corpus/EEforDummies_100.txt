In the battery symbol (see Figure 1-9, 
left), the plus sign signifies the positive 
terminal (sometimes called the cath-
ode); the minus sign signifies the nega-
tive terminal (or the anode). Usually 
the batteryâ€™s voltage is shown along-
side the symbol. The sine wave in the 
symbol for an AC voltage source (see 
Figure 1-9, center) is a reminder that 
the voltage varies up and down. In the 
symbol for a photovoltaic cell (see Figure 1-9, right), the two arrows pointing 
towards the battery symbol signify light energy.
