The ﬁrst plot visualizes the results of system simulation for a
lake dive. Note the temperature proﬁle of the lake (second trace).
In contrast, the second plot depicts the simulation results
for an ocean dive. The system’s model of the gauge is as before,
but the environment has changed. The gauge model, therefore,
acts as a virtual prototype being exercised in different contexts.
The accuracy of the model is visible from the third trace in
each plot. The absolute error (i.e., the difference between the
actual and the measured depth) is in the range of the least
signiﬁcant bit of the discretized value.
