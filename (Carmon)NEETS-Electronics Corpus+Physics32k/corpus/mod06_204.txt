This has been an explanation of one cycle of an input signal that overdrives the tube. You should
notice that, using the same circuit, a 50-volt peak-to-peak input signal caused a vastly different output
from that caused by the 6-volt peak-to-peak input signal. The 6-volt peak-to-peak signal did not overdrive
the tube. When the input signal was increased to 50-volts peak-to-peak, the tube was forced into cutoff
when the grid was driven to -24 volts, and into saturation when the grid was driven to +12 volts (the grid
voltage plus the signal voltage.) During these periods, the tube could not respond to the input signal. In
other words, the output was distorted. A method commonly used to partially overcome distortion is to
vary the bias voltage on the grid. The point at which the tube goes into cutoff or saturation can then be
controlled.
