Magnetism, the property of the magnet, can be 
traced to the atom. As electrons orbit around the nu-
cleus of the atom, they spin on their axis, like the earth 
as it orbits the sun. This moving electrostatic charge 
produces a magnetic field. The direction of the mag-
netic field depends on the electronâ€™s direction of spin. 
Iron, nickel, and cobalt are the only naturally mag-
netic elements. Each of these materials has two valence
