An ELECTRON’S ENERGY LEVEL is the amount of energy required by an electron to stay in
orbit. Just by the electron’s motion alone, it has kinetic energy. The electron’s position in reference to the
nucleus gives it potential energy. An energy balance keeps the electron in orbit and as it gains or loses
energy, it assumes an orbit further from or closer to the center of the atom.
