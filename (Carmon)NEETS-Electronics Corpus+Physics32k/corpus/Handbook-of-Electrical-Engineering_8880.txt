One use of a simple interleaved memory system is to back up a cache memory. To do so, the memory must
be able to read blocks of contiguous words (a cache block) and supply them to the cache. If the low-order  k
bits of the address are used to select the bank number, then consecutive words of the block reside in different
banks, and they can all be read in parallel, and supplied to the cache one by one. If some other address bits
are used for bank selection, then multiple words from the block might fall in the same memory bank, requiring
multiple accesses to the same bank to fetch the block.
