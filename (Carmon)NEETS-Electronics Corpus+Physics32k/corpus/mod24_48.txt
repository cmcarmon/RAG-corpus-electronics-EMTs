A fiber optic data link also includes passive components other than an optical fiber. Figure 1-1 does
not show the optical connections used to complete the construction of the fiber optic data link. Passive
components used to make fiber connections affect the performance of the data link. These components
can also prevent the link from operating. Fiber optic components used to make the optical connections
include optical splices, connectors, and couplers. Chapter 4 outlines the types of optical splices,
connectors, and couplers and their connection properties that affect system performance.
