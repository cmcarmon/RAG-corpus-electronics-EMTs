It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, Lancaster University's physics department offer the following schemes:
MPhys Physics
MPhys Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology
MPhys Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology
MPhys Physics with Space Science
MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics
MPhys Theoretical Physics
MPhys Theoretical Physics with Mathematics
These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules. Students tend to take all the same core modules during their first year and start to specialise in their second year. In some cases, optional modules can be taken from other schemes.
