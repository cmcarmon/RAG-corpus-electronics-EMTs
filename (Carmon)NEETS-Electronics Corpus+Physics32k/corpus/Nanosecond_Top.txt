A nanosecond (ns) is an SI unit of time equal to one thousand-millionth of a second, (or one billionth of a second) that is, 1/1,000,000,000 of a second, or 10−9 seconds.
The word nanosecond is formed by the prefix nano and the second one is second a basic unit of time or a sixtieth of a second .
A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or ​1⁄1000 microsecond. Because the next SI unit is 1000 times larger, times of 10−8 and 10−7 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.
Times of this granularity are commonly encountered in telecommunications, pulsed lasers and some areas of electronics.
