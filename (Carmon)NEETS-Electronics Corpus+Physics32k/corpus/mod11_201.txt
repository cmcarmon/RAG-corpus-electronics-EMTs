mechanical action called TUNNELING. Tunneling causes the negative-resistance action and is so fast 
that no transit-time effects occur even at microwave frequencies. The lack of a transit-time effect permits 
the use of tunnel diodes in a wide variety of microwave circuits, such as amplifiers, oscillators, and 
switching devices. The detailed theory of tunnel-diode operation and the negative-resistance property 
exhibited by the tunnel diode was discussed in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and 
Power Supplies, Chapter 3.
