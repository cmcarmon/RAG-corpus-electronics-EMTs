Important problems in the development of chemical biomedical sensors are similar to those discussed above
for  the  pressure  sensor.  Issues  of  long-term  stability  and  packaging  are  critical  to  the  success  of  a  chemical
sensor. The package is even more critical in chemical sensors than it was in pressure sensors in that the package
must protect portions of the sensor that require isolation from the solutions being measured while it provides
direct contact of the chemically sensitive portions of the sensor to the solution. The maintenance of a window
through the package for this contact represents a critical aspect of sensor development. Frequent calibration is
also necessary for chemical sensors. Just about every type of chemical sensor requires some sort of calibration
being sensed. The best calibration method
using a standard solution with known concentration of the 
is a two-point procedure where two standards are used to establish the slope and the intercept of the calibration
line. Some chemical sensors have stable slopes but need to be calibrated in terms of the baseline or intercept.
In this case a single-point calibration can be used.
