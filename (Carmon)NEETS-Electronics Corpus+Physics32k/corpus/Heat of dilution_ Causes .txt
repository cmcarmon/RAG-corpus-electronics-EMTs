Viewed from a microscopic perspective, the dilution process involves three steps of molecular interaction: the breaking of attraction between solute molecules, the breaking of attraction between solvent molecules, and the forming of attraction between a solute and a solvent molecule. If the solution is ideal, which means the solute and the solvent are identical in an interaction, then all the kinds of attraction mentioned above have the same value. As a result, the enthalpy change caused by breaking and forming attraction is canceled, and the dilution of an ideal solution causes no enthalpy change.
However, if the solute and solvent cannot be treated identically when considered in terms of molecular attraction, which makes the solution non-ideal, the net change of enthalpy is nonzero. In other words, the heat of dilution results from the non-ideality of the solution.
