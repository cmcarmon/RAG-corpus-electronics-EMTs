Current pulses of the PEMF devices are usually produced by the discharge of capacitor banks controlled by
a timing network. The applicator coil cannot be interchanged among different devices because its inductance
and resistance are a part of the discharge network. While earlier bone growth stimulators employed Helmholtz
coil-pair arrangements, most present devices have single coils which can be custom-shaped for particular limbs.
Figure 113.34 shows a typical system sold by EBI. This unit is driven by rechargeable batteries, and the control
unit  (shown  in  Fig.  113.34)  includes  an  elapsed-time  clock  to  measure  the  total  time  of  stimulation  of  the
fracture being treated. A typical treatment time can be between 2 and 10 h/day over a period of 6 months.
