Because receiver sensitivity readings are taken periodically for comparison purposes, the identical 
pulse length must be used for each measurement. Maintenance instructions for the radar set usually 
specify the correct pulse length to be used in receiver sensitivity tests. In most cases, it is the same as the 
transmitter pulse length.
