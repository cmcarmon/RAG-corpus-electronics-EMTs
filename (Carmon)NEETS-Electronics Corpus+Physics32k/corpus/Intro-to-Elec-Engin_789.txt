Let us consider the simple MOSFET inverter with resistive load shown in Figure 9.3.1(a),
quite similar in principle to the BJT inverter, although the circuit is rather impractical, as we shall
see later. The load line for RD = 23 k and VDD = 7 V is shown along with the transistor I–V
characteristics in Figure 9.3.1(b). On ﬁnding vout (= vDS) for different values of vin (= vGS), the
