For typical coaxial cable, this propagation speed is a fraction (one-third to two-thirds) of the speed of light.
While this high-frequency analysis shows that the dominant high-frequency component of γ is its imagi-
nary part, there could be (and is!) a smaller real part. Since the real part of γ is the attenuation factor a, a
more detailed analysis is required to determine if a = 0 (no attenuation) or is non-zero. One way of pursuing
a more detailed analysis is to exploit equation (6.10) by
