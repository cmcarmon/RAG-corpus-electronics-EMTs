Performance Limitations
In  a  typical  reception  of  a  signal  wavefront,  noise  and  interference  can  degrade  the  performance  of  a  sonar
system and limit the system’s ability to detect signals in the underwater environment. The noise or interference
could be sounds from a school of ﬁsh, shipping (surface or subsurface) noise, active transmission interference
(e.g., jammers), or interference when multiple receivers or sonar systems are in operation simultaneously. Also,
the ambient noise may have unusual vertical or horizontal directivity and in some environments, such as the
Arctic, the noise due to ice motion may produce unfamiliar interference. Unwanted backscatters, similar to the
headlights of a car driving in fog, can cause a signal-induced noise that degrades processing gain without proper
processing. Some other performance-limiting factors are the loss of signal level and acoustic coherence due to
boundary  interaction  as  a  function  of  grazing  angle;  the  radiated  pattern  (signal  level)  of  the  object  and  its
spatial coherence; the presence of surface, bottom, and volume reverberation (in active sonar); signal spreading
owing to the modulating effect of surface motion; biologic noise as a function of time (both time of day and
time of year); and statistics of the noise in the medium. (Does the noise arrive in the same or at different ray
path angles as the signal?)
