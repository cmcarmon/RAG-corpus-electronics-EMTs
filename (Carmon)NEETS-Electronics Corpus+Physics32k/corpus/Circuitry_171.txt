where  Vs
resistance of the inductor, and L is the inductance. 
  The current, i, will initially be zero and will rise 
to  approximately  63%  of  its  maximum  value  (i.e. 
Vs /R) in a time interval equal to the time constant. 
At the end of the next interval of time equal to the 
time  constant  (i.e.  after  a  total  time  of  2L/R  has 
elapsed)  the  current  will  have  risen  by  a  further 
63% of the remainder, and so on. 
In  theory,  the  current  in  the  inductor  will  never 
 
become  equal  to  Vs /R.  However,  after  a  period  of 
time  equal  to  5L/R,  the  current  will  to  all  intents 
and  purposes  be  equal  to  Vs /R.  At  this  point  the
