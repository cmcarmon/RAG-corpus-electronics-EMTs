More  complicated  examples  of  ideal  ﬁlters  can
be constructed by cascading ideal low-pass, high-
pass, bandpass, and bandstop ﬁlters. For instance,
by cascading bandstop ﬁlters with different values
, we can construct an ideal comb ﬁlter,
of 
whose magnitude function is illustrated in Fig. 10.2.
