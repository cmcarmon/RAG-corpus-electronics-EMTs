This circuit is amenable to a straightforward application of the node
method. Recall that the node method and its foundational Kirchhoff’s voltage
and current laws are derived from Maxwell’s Equations with no assumptions
about linearity. (Note, however, that the superposition method, the Thévenin
method, and the Norton method do require a linearity assumption.)
