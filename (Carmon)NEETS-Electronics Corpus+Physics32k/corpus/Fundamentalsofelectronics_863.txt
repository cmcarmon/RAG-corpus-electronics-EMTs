Point of Interest: In the early years of information theory, the race was on to be the ﬁrst to ﬁnd
a provably maximally eﬃcient source coding algorithm. The race was won by then MIT graduate
student David Huﬀman30 in 1954, who worked on the problem as a project in his information theory
course. We’re pretty sure he received an “A.”
