machine state stored in a latch, functional failure will result.
Even when noise does not cause functional failure, it has an
impact on timing, affecting both delay and slew. Noise can also
cause the dissipation of extra power due to incorrect switching.
Digital circuits create deterministic noise several orders
of magnitude greater than noise from stochastic physical
sources. Problems due to these noise sources were ﬁrst
observed in mixed signal applications that plunged highly
noise sensitive analog circuits into a noisy digital environment.
Although digital circuits create much more noise than analog
circuits, digital systems are prevalent because they are inher-
ently immune to noise. Figure 7.2 shows valid voltage ranges
for deﬁning the digital 0 and 1.
