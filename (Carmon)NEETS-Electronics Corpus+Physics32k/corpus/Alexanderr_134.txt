To  illustrate  the  steps,  consider  the  circuit  in  Fig.  3.17.  The  ﬁrst
step requires that mesh currents 
are assigned to meshes 1 and
2. Although a mesh current may be assigned to each mesh in an arbi-
trary  direction,  it  is  conventional  to  assume  that  each  mesh  current
ﬂows clockwise.
