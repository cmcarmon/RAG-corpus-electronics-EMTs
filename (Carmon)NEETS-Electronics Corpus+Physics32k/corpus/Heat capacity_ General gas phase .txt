The specific heat of the gas is best conceptualized in terms of the degrees of freedom of an individual molecule. The different degrees of freedom correspond to the different ways in which the molecule may store energy. The molecule may store energy in its translational motion according to the formula:

{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\,m\left(v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}+v_{z}^{2}\right)}

where m  is the mass of the molecule and

{\displaystyle [v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}]}
is velocity of the center of mass of the molecule. Each direction of motion constitutes a degree of freedom, thus there are three translational degrees of freedom.
In addition, a molecule may have rotational motion. The kinetic energy of rotational motion is generally expressed as

{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}\,\left(I_{1}\omega _{1}^{2}+I_{2}\omega _{2}^{2}+I_{3}\omega _{3}^{2}\right)}

where I  is the moment of inertia tensor of the molecule, and

{\displaystyle [\omega _{1},\omega _{2},\omega _{3}]}
is the angular velocity pseudo-vector (in a coordinate system aligned with the principal axes of the molecule). In general, then, there will be three additional degrees of freedom corresponding to the rotational motion of the molecule, (For linear molecules one of the inertia tensor terms vanishes and there are only two rotational degrees of freedom). The degrees of freedom corresponding to translations and rotations are called the rigid degrees of freedom, since they do not involve any deformation of the molecule.
The motions of the atoms in a molecule which are not part of its gross translational motion or rotation may be classified as vibrational motions. It can be shown that if there are n atoms in the molecule, there will be as many as

{\displaystyle v=3n-3-n_{r}}
vibrational degrees of freedom, where

{\displaystyle n_{r}}
is the number of rotational degrees of freedom. A vibrational degree of freedom corresponds to a specific way in which all the atoms of a molecule can vibrate. The actual number of possible vibrations may be less than this maximal one, due to various symmetries.
For example, triatomic nitrous oxide N2O will have only 2 degrees of rotational freedom (since it is a linear molecule) and contains n=3 atoms: thus the number of possible vibrational degrees of freedom will be v = (3⋅3) − 3 − 2 = 4. There are four ways or "modes" in which the three atoms can vibrate, corresponding to 1) A mode in which an atom at each end of the molecule moves away from, or towards, the center atom at the same time, 2) a mode in which either end atom moves asynchronously with regard to the other two, and 3) and 4) two modes in which the molecule bends out of line, from the center, in the two possible planar directions that are orthogonal to its axis. Each vibrational degree of freedom confers TWO total degrees of freedom, since vibrational energy mode partitions into 1 kinetic and 1 potential mode. This would give nitrous oxide 3 translational, 2 rotational, and 4 vibrational modes (but these last giving 8 vibrational degrees of freedom), for storing energy. This is a total of f = 3 + 2 + 8 = 13 total energy-storing degrees of freedom, for N2O.
For a bent molecule like water H2O, a similar calculation gives 9 − 3 − 3 = 3 modes of vibration, and 3 (translational) + 3 (rotational) + 6 (vibrational) = 12 degrees of freedom.
