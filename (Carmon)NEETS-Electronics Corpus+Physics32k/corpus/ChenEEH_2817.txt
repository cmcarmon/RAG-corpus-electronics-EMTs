quency (ELF) propagation about the entire earth to the lasing
behavior of aggregates of micron-scale particles exhibiting
four-level quantum-system characteristics. Such applications
of FDTD vividly illustrate the principle that ‘‘Maxwell’s equa-
tions work from dc to light.’’ The goal of this section is to
provide examples of current and emerging FDTD applications
that literally span this range.
