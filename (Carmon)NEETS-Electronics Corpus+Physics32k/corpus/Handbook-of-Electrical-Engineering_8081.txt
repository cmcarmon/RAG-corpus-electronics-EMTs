Dedicated digital signal processors offer an excellent alternative or supplement to general-purpose micro-
processors for signal processing applications. As a slave to a conventional processor, the DSP chip is freed from
communicating with peripherals, increasing throughput. For additional performance, DSP chips may be oper-
ated  in  a  multiprocessor  conÔ¨Åguration,  controlled  by  a  central  processor.  Such  an  arrangement  would  be
appropriate  for  applications  such  as  phased-array  radar,  where  the  volume  of  data  and  uniformity  of  the
calculations lend themselves to distributed processing.
