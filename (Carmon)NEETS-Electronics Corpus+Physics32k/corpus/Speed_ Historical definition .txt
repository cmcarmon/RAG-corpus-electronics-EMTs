Italian physicist Galileo Galilei is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation form, that is




v
=


d
t


,


{\displaystyle v={\frac {d}{t}},}

where



v


{\displaystyle v}
is speed,



d


{\displaystyle d}
is distance, and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50 km/h, slow to 0 km/h, and then reach 30 km/h).
