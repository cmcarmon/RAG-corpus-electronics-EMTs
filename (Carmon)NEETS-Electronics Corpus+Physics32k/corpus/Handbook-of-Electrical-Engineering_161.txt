Zigzag Connection (Fig. 1.30)
This connection is also called the interconnected star connection where the winding of each phase is divided
into two halves and interconnected to form a zigzag conÔ¨Åguration. The zigzag connection is mostly used to
derive  a  neutral  point  for  grounding  purposes  in  three-phase,  three-wire  systems.  The  neutral  point  can  be
used to (1) supply single-phase loads, (2) provide a safety ground, and (3) sense and limit ground fault currents.
