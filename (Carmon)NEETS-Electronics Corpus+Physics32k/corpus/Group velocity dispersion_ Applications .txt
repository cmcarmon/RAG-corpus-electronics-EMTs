Group velocity dispersion is most commonly used to estimate the amount of chirp that will be imposed on a pulse of light after passing through a material of interest. The relevant expression is given by






chirp


=
(


material






thickness


)

×



GVD


(

ω

0


)

×

(


bandwidth


)
.


{\displaystyle {\textrm {chirp}}=({\textrm {material}}\,\,{\textrm {thickness}})\,\times \,{\textrm {GVD}}(\omega _{0})\,\times \,({\textrm {bandwidth}}).}
