Such particles would belong to a singlet representation with respect to the strong interaction and the weak interaction, having zero electric charge, zero weak hypercharge, zero weak isospin, and, as with the other leptons, no color, although they do have a B-L of −1. If the standard model is embedded in a hypothetical SO(10) grand unified theory, they can be assigned an X charge of −5. The left-handed anti-neutrino has a B-L of 1 and an X charge of +5.
Due to the lack of charge, sterile neutrinos would not interact electromagnetically, weakly, or strongly, making them extremely difficult to detect. They have Yukawa interactions with ordinary leptons and Higgs bosons, which via the Higgs mechanism lead to mixing with ordinary neutrinos. In experiments involving energies larger than their mass they would participate in all processes in which ordinary neutrinos take part, but with a quantum mechanical probability that is suppressed by the small mixing angle. That makes it possible to produce them in experiments if they are light enough. They would also interact gravitationally due to their mass, however, and if they are heavy enough, they could explain cold dark matter or warm dark matter. In some grand unification theories, such as SO(10), they also interact via gauge interactions which are extremely suppressed at ordinary energies because their gauge boson is extremely massive. They do not appear at all in some other GUTs, such as the Georgi–Glashow model (i.e. all its SU(5) charges or quantum numbers are zero).
