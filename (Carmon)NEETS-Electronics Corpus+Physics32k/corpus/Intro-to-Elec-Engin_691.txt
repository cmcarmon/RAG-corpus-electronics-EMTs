Small-scale integration (SSI) is used typically for a 20-component op amp, whereas large-
scale integration (LSI) puts an entire microprocessor, typically with 10,000 components, on a
single chip. The chief beneÔ¨Åts from integrating many components on an IC are low cost, small
size, high reliability, and matched characteristics. Of the many IC packaging technologies, the
most popular is the dual-in-line package (DIP), which consists of a rectangular plastic or ceramic
case enclosing the IC, with protruding pin terminals. While an op amp is commonly supplied in
an 8-pin DIP for insertion into some larger circuit, a microprocessor may have a 40- to 64-pin
DIP to accommodate the many external connections needed for an LSI chip.
