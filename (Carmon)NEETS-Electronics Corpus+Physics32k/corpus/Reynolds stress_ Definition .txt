The velocity field of a flow can be split into a mean part and a fluctuating part using Reynolds decomposition. We write





u

i


=



u

i


¯


+

u

i

′

,



{\displaystyle u_{i}={\overline {u_{i}}}+u_{i}',\,}

with




u

(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t)}
being the flow velocity vector having components




u

i




{\displaystyle u_{i}}
in the




x

i




{\displaystyle x_{i}}
coordinate direction (with




x

i




{\displaystyle x_{i}}
denoting the components of the coordinate vector




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
). The mean velocities






u

i


¯




{\displaystyle {\overline {u_{i}}}}
are determined by either time averaging, spatial averaging or ensemble averaging, depending on the flow under study. Further




u

i

′



{\displaystyle u'_{i}}
denotes the fluctuating (turbulence) part of the velocity.
We consider a homogeneous fluid, whose density ρ is taken to be a constant. For such a fluid, the components τ'ij of the Reynolds stress tensor are defined as:





τ

i
j

′

≡
ρ





u

i

′



u

j

′


¯


,



{\displaystyle \tau '_{ij}\equiv \rho \,{\overline {u'_{i}\,u'_{j}}},\,}

Another – often used – definition, for constant density, of the Reynolds stress components is:





τ

i
j

″

≡




u

i

′



u

j

′


¯


,



{\displaystyle \tau ''_{ij}\equiv {\overline {u'_{i}\,u'_{j}}},\,}

which has the dimensions of velocity squared, instead of stress.
