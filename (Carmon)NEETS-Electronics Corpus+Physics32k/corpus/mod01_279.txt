SHELLS AND SUBSHELLS of electrons are the orbits of the electrons in the atom. Each shell
contains a maximum of 2 times its number squared electrons. Shells are lettered K through Q, starting
with K, which is the closest to the nucleus. The shell can be split into 4 subshells labeled s, p, d, and f,
which can contain 2, 6, 10, and 14 electrons, respectively.
