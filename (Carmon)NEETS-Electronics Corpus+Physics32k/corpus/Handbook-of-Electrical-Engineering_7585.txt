The 50-W pull-down resistors shown in Fig. 79.12 are connected externally. The outputs of several gates can
therefore share a common pull-down resistor to form a wired-OR connection. The open emitter outputs also
provide ï¬‚exibility for driving transmission lines, the use of which in most cases is mandatory for interconnecting
this high-speed logic. A twisted pair interconnection can be driven using the complementary outputs (A + B)
and (A + B) as a differential output. Such a line should be terminated in an ECL line receiver (10114).
