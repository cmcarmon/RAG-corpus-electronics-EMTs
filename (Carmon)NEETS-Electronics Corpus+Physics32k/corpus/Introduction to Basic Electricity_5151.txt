technician. It can identify defects in a circuit while 
it is powered up; this includes changing parameters 
of a circuit. An oscilloscope displays the instanta-
neous voltage on the vertical axis against time on 
the horizontal axis and can detect both DC and AC 
signals. Some oscilloscopes  allow the comparison of 
two waveforms of the same frequency to determine 
the phase shift. The  oscilloscope probe on most os-
cilloscopes allows switching between settings of 1X 
and 10X  (FigureÂ  49-6). When the signal exceeds 
the capability of the oscilloscope on the 1X setting, 
the 10X setting multiplies the voltage setting of the 
oscilloscope by 10 and makes viewing the signal 
possible.
