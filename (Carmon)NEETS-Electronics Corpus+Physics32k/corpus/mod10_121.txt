Sound reflections (echoes) have many applications in the Navy. The most important of these
applications can be found in the use of depth finding equipment (the fathometer) and sonar. The
fathometer sends sound-wave pulses from the bottom of the ship and receives echoes from the ocean floor
to indicate the depth of the ocean beneath the ship. The sonar transmits a pulse of sound energy and
receives the echo to indicate range and bearing of objects or targets in the ocean depths.
