Shirazi et al., 1998a, 2000). To enable the high-level description
of run-time reconﬁgurable designs, a model has been de-
veloped for specifying, visualizing, and optimizing reconﬁgur-
able designs (Luk et al., 1999). Such designs can be compiled
into hardware by tools that take into account that reconﬁgur-
able designs change dynamically with time (Shirazi et al.,
2000). Given information regarding the sequence of reconﬁg-
uration, the tools select and reﬁne appropriate components in
reconﬁgurable regions.
