The disadvantage of carbon resistors can be overcome by the use of WIREWOUND resistors (fig.
1-29 (B) and (C)). Wirewound resistors have very accurate values and possess a higher current handling
capability than carbon resistors. The material that is frequently used to manufacture wirewound resistors
