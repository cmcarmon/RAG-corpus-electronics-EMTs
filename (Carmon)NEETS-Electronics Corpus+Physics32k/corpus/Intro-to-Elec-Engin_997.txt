The ﬁeld winding may be concentrated around the salient poles, as shown in Figures 12.2.1(a)
and 12.2.2, or distributed in slots around the cylindrical rotor, as in Figure 12.2.1(b). By properly
shaping the pole faces in the former case, and by appropriately distributing the ﬁeld winding in
the latter, an approximately sinusoidal ﬁeld is produced in the air gap.
