The light-second is a convenient unit for measuring distances in the inner Solar System, because it corresponds very closely to the radiometric data used to determine them (the match is not exact for an Earth-based observer because of a very small correction for the effects of relativity). The value of the astronomical unit (roughly the distance from the Earth to the Sun) in light seconds is a fundamental measurement for the calculation of modern ephemerides (tables of planetary positions): it is usually quoted as "light-time for unit distance" in tables of astronomical constants, and its currently accepted value is 499.004786385(20) s.
The mean diameter of the Earth is about 0.0425 light-seconds.
The average distance from the Earth to the Moon is about 1.282 light-seconds.
The diameter of the Sun is about 4.643 light-seconds.
The average distance from the Earth to the Sun is 499.0 light-seconds.
Multiples of the light-second can be defined, although apart from the light-year they are more used in popular science publications than in research works. For example, a light-minute is 60 light-seconds and the average distance from the Earth to the Sun is 8.317 light-minutes.
