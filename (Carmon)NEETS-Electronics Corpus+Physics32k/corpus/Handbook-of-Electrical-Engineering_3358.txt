A  different  type  of  passive  component  is  an  optical  polarizer,  which  can  be  made  using  several  different
techniques.  One  such  method  is  the  metal-clad,  dielectric-buffered  waveguide  shown  in  Fig.  31.19.  In  this
passive device, the TM polarization state is coupled into the absorbing metal and is thus attenuated, while the
TE polarization is virtually unaffected. Measurements of a 2-mm-long polarizer of this type have demonstrated
TM attenuations exceeding 50 dB (100,000:1). Polarizers can also be fabricated in others ways. One interesting
technique  involves  the  diffusion  of  hydrogen  ions  into  the  LiNbO3.  This  results  in  a  waveguide  which,  as
discussed earlier, will only support the TE-polarized mode and, thus, is a natural polarizer.
