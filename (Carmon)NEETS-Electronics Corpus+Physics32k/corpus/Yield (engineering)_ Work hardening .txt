Where deforming the material will introduce dislocations, which increases their density in the material. This increases the yield strength of the material, since now more stress must be applied to move these dislocations through a crystal lattice. Dislocations can also interact with each other, becoming entangled.
The governing formula for this mechanism is:

{\displaystyle \Delta \sigma _{y}=Gb{\sqrt {\rho }}}

where




σ

y




{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}}
is the yield stress, G is the shear elastic modulus, b is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the dislocation density.
