Feedback is also used to get the ideal input signal. Normally, the maximum output signal is desired 
from an amplifier. The amount of the output signal from an amplifier is dependent on the amount of the 
input signal. However, if the input signal is too large, the amplifying device will be saturated and/or cut 
off during part of the input signal. This causes the output signal to be distorted and reduces the fidelity of 
the amplifier. Amplifiers must provide the proper balance of gain and fidelity.
