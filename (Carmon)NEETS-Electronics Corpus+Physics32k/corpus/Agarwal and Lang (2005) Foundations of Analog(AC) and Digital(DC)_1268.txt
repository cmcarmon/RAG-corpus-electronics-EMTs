where the second equality results from the substitution of Equation 9.44 and
then Equation 9.43. Thus, we see that the inductances of inductors in series add.
This is consistent with the physical derivation of inductance in Equation 9.23
since placing inductors in series essentially increases the total length of core
around which the parallel turns are wound.
