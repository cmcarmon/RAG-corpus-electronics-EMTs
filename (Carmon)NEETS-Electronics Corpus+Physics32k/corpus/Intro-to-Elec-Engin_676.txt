The input resistance of a MOSFET is even higher than that of the JFET (typically on the order
of 1010 to 1015 ) because of the insulating layer of the gate. As in JFETs, the conductive gate
current is negligibly small in most applications. The insulating oxide layer can, however, be
damaged easily due to buildup of static charges. While the MOSFET devices are often shipped
with leads conductively tied together to neutralize static charges, users too must be careful in
handling MOSFETs to prevent damage due to static electricity. The MOSFETs are used primarily
in digital electronic circuits. They can also provide controlled-source characteristics, which are
utilized in ampliÔ¨Åer circuits.
