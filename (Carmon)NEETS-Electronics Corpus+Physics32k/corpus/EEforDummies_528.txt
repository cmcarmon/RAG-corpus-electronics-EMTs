In each case, the power applied to the primary winding is transferred to the 
secondary. Because power is the product of voltage and current  P V I
, 
the current induced in the secondary winding is inversely proportional to the 
voltage induced in the secondary. So a step‐up transformer steps up the volt-
age while stepping down the current; a step‐down transformer steps down 
the voltage while stepping up the current.
