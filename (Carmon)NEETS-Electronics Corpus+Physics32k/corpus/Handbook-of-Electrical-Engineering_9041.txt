Figure 89.29(a) shows a piezoelectric/membrane laminate design with a disk-shaped piezoelectric transducer
which, upon being pulsed, deforms (assumes a ﬁnite radius of curvature) and thus creates a pressure wave in
the ink chamber. Figure 89.29(b) illustrates an “oil-can” version of the laminate approach. In Figure 89.29(c),
a tubular transducer is used to squeeze the ink chamber. Figure 89.29(d) represents a push-rod or piston design
where the piezoelectric material is used in the extensional mode. Attempts have also been made to use modern
semiconductor planar/etching processing techniques to create low-cost arrays of devices.
