The  patient  is  admitted  and  treatment  is  provided  more  quickly,  historical  information  is  more  accurate,
and personal physicians and specialists can be consulted more quickly. Less testing may be a direct result, and
faster diagnosis is accomplished. Since information needs to be entered only once, patients do not need to rely
on their memory, particularly in emergency situations.
