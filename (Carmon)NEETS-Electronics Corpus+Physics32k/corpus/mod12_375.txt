a usable reconstructed modulation curve. At the sampling rate of figure 2-50 and with a 4-element binary
code, 128 bits (presence or absence of pulses) must be transmitted for each cycle of the modulating
frequency. At the sampling rate of figure 2-51, only 32 bits are required; at the minimum sampling rate,
only 8 bits are required.
