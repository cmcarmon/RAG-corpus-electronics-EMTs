The velocity resolution is the minimal radial velocity difference between two objects traveling at the same range before the radar can detect two discrete reflections:





velocity resolution

C

PRF




transmit frequency

filter size in transmit pulses




.


{\displaystyle {\text{velocity resolution}}={\frac {C\times {\text{PRF}}}{{\text{transmit frequency}}\times {\text{filter size in transmit pulses}}}}.}
