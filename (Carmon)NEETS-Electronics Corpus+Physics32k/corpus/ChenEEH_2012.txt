actual error to go undetected, and this can lead to substantial
inaccuracies in the Ô¨Ånal result. In addition, if ABFT is being
used as a detection mechanism for hardware faults, then tran-
sient and, more dangerously,
intermittent and permanent
faults can go undetected for a long time. Hence, the issue of
acceptable accurate error detection of various matrix compu-
tations using equality test-based ABFT schemes needed to be
satisfactorily solved.
