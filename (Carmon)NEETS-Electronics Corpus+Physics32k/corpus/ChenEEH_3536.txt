An important observation is that both discrete-time and con-
tinuous-time systems that are linear and time invariant are
completely characterized by their impulse responses. Other
properties of LSI systems, such as causality, stability, and
invertibility, can then be characterized in terms of a systemâ€™s
impulse response.
