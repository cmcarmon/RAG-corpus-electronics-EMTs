Most modes in multimode step-index fibers propagate far from cutoff. Modes that are cut off cease
to be bound to the core of the fiber. Modes that are farther away from the cutoff wavelength concentrate
most of their light energy into the fiber core. Modes that propagate close to cutoff have a greater
percentage of their light energy propagate in the cladding. Since most modes propagate far from cutoff,
the majority of light propagates in the fiber core. Therefore, in multimode step-index fibers, cladding
properties, such as cladding diameter, have limited affect on mode (light) propagation.
