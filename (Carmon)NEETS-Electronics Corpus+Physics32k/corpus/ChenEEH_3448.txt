blocking or a tripping signal. In the case a blocking signal is
issued, the relay from one end, after making a decision about a
fault, sends a blocking signal to the other relay. If a trip signal
is used, the relay that ﬁrst detects the fault sends a signal to the
other end. This will make the other relay perform a trip action
immediately after it has detected a fault as well. Additional
consideration in selecting the scheme relates to the type of
detectors used in the relays for making the decisions about the
existence of a fault and the location of the fault with the respect
to the zones. Speciﬁc choices in setting up the zones are made
for each scheme operation. Typical choices for the detector
types are overcurrent and/or directional, with the zone I and /
or zone II settings being involved in the decision making.
A summary of the above considerations is given in Table 9.3.
As with any other relaying approach, the scheme implemen-
tations also have different performance criteria established. If
one takes the dependability/security criterion (WG D5, 1997;
WG, 1981) as the guiding factor in making the decisions, then
the property of the various relaying scheme solutions can be
classiﬁed as follows:
