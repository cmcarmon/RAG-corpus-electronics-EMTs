quantities of energy, the capacitor storing energy in the medium of an electric ﬁeld and the
inductor storing energy in the medium of a magnetic ﬁeld. A capacitor’s electrostatic energy
storage manifests itself in the tendency to maintain a constant voltage across the terminals.
An inductor’s electromagnetic energy storage manifests itself in the tendency to maintain a
constant current through it.
