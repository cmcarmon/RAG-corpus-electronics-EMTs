e x a m p l e 12.9 c a s c a d e d i n v e r t e r s We now apply the results
of this section to a practical problem, namely the study of the cascaded inverters shown
in Figure 12.1, and modeled in Figure 12.4. What is new in the latter figure is the
parasitic wiring inductance between the two inverters, which makes the circuit a second-
order circuit. As discussed in Subsections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3, parasitic inductance is present
in all wiring. In some cases it is particularly important, and these cases are generally
characterized by a large Q when they are second-order in nature.
