When a ball impacts a surface, the surface recoils and vibrates, as does the ball, creating both sound and heat, and the ball loses kinetic energy. Additionally, the impact can impart some rotation to the ball, transferring some of its translational kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. This energy loss is usually characterized (indirectly) through the coefficient of restitution (or COR, denoted e):

{\displaystyle e=-{\frac {v_{\text{f}}-u_{\text{f}}}{v_{\text{i}}-u_{\text{i}}}},}

where vf and vi are the final and initial velocities of the ball, and uf and ui are the final and initial velocities impacting surface, respectively. In the specific case where a ball impacts on an immovable surface, the COR simplifies to

.


{\displaystyle e=-{\frac {v_{\text{f}}}{v_{\text{i}}}}.}

For a ball dropped against a floor, the COR will therefore vary between 0 (no bounce, total loss of energy) and 1 (perfectly bouncy, no energy loss). A COR value below 0 or above 1 is theoretically possible, but would indicate that the ball went through the surface (e < 0), or that the surface was not "relaxed" when the ball impacted it (e > 1), like in the case of a ball landing on spring-loaded platform.
To analyze the vertical and horizontal components of the motion, the COR is sometimes split up into a normal COR (ey), and tangential COR (ex), defined as

{\displaystyle e_{\text{x}}=-{\frac {(v_{\text{xf}}-r\omega _{\text{f}})-(u_{\text{xf}}-R\Omega _{\text{f}})}{(v_{\text{xi}}-r\omega _{\text{i}})-(u_{\text{xi}}-R\Omega _{\text{i}})}},}

where r and ω denote the radius and angular velocity of the ball, while R and Ω denote the radius and angular velocity the impacting surface (such as a baseball bat). In particular rω is the tangential velocity of the ball's surface, while RΩ is the tangential velocity of the impacting surface. These are especially of interest when the ball impacts the surface at an oblique angle, or when rotation is involved.
For a straight drop on the ground with no rotation, with only the force of gravity acting on the ball, the COR can be related to several other quantities by:

{\displaystyle e=\left|{\frac {v_{\text{f}}}{v_{\text{i}}}}\right|={\sqrt {\frac {K_{\text{f}}}{K_{\text{i}}}}}={\sqrt {\frac {U_{\text{f}}}{U_{\text{i}}}}}={\sqrt {\frac {H_{\text{f}}}{H_{\text{i}}}}}={\frac {T_{\text{f}}}{T_{\text{i}}}}={\sqrt {\frac {gT_{\text{f}}^{2}}{8H_{\text{i}}}}}.}

Here, K and U denote the kinetic and potential energy of the ball, H is the maximum height of the ball, and T is the time of flight of the ball. The 'i' and 'f' subscript refer to the initial (before impact) and final (after impact) states of the ball. Likewise, the energy loss at impact can be related to the COR by

The COR of a ball can be affected by several things, mainly
the nature of the impacting surface (e.g. grass, concrete, wire mesh)
the material of the ball (e.g. leather, rubber, plastic)
the pressure inside the ball (if hollow)
the amount of rotation induced in the ball at impact
the impact velocity
External conditions such as temperature can change the properties of the impacting surface or of the ball, making them either more flexible or more rigid. This will, in turn, affect the COR. In general, the ball will deform more at higher impact velocities and will accordingly lose more of its energy, decreasing its COR.
