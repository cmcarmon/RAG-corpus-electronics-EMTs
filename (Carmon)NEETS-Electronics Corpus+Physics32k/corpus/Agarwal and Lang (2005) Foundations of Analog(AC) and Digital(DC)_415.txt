Figure 3.1a shows a circuit that we saw earlier in Chapter 2, and illustrates
some new notation. Node c has been chosen as ground. The upside down ‘‘T ’’
symbol is the notation for the ground node. Nodes a and b are two other nodes
of this circuit. Their node voltages ea and eb are marked. Figure 3.1b illustrates
that the node voltages are measured with respect to the ground node.
