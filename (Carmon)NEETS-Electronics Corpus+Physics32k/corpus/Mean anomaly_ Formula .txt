The mean anomaly M can be computed from the eccentric anomaly E and the eccentricity e with Kepler's Equation:

{\displaystyle M=E-e\sin E.}

{\displaystyle M=M_{0}+n\left(t-t_{0}\right),}

where M0 is the mean anomaly at epoch and t0 is the epoch, a reference time to which the orbital elements are referred, which may or may not coincide with τ, the time of pericenter passage. The classical method of finding the position of an object in an elliptical orbit from a set of orbital elements is to calculate the mean anomaly by this equation, and then to solve Kepler's equation for the eccentric anomaly.
Define ϖ as the longitude of the pericenter, the angular distance of the pericenter from a reference direction. Define l as the mean longitude, the angular distance of the body from the same reference direction, assuming it moves with uniform angular motion as with the mean anomaly. Thus mean anomaly is also




M

{\displaystyle M=l-\varpi .}

Mean angular motion can also be expressed,




n
=

,


{\displaystyle n={\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{a^{3}}}},}

where μ is a gravitational parameter which varies with the masses of the objects, and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. Mean anomaly can then be expanded,




M

,


{\displaystyle M={\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{a^{3}}}}(t-\tau ),}

and here mean anomaly represents uniform angular motion on a circle of radius a.
Mean anomaly can be expressed as a series expansion of the eccentricity e and the true anomaly ν,
