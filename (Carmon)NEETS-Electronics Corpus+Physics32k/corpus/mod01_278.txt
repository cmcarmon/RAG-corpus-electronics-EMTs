ENERGY LEVELS of the electron exist because the electron has mass and motion. The motion
gives it kinetic energy and its position gives it potential energy. Energy balance keeps the electron in orbit
and should it gain energy it will assume an orbit further from the center of the atom. It will remain at that
level for only a fraction of a second before it radiates the excess energy and goes back to a lower orbit.
