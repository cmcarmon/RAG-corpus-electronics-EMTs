The erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM) was developed to overcome the drawback 
of PROM. EPROMs can also be purchased blank from the manufacturer and programmed locally at your 
command/activity. Again, this requires special equipment. The big difference with EPROM is that it can 
be erased if and when the need arises. Data and programs can be retrieved over and over again without 
destroying the contents of the EPROM. They will stay there quite safely until you want to reprogram it by 
first erasing the EPROM with a burst of ultra-violet light. This is to your advantage, because if a mistake 
is made while programming the EPROM, it is not considered fatal. The EPROM can be erased and 
corrected. Also, it allows you the flexibility to change programs to include improvements or 
modifications in the future.
