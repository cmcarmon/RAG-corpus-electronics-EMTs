Processing data with gates
Logic gates, or simply gates, are tiny digital circuits that accept one or more 
data bits as inputs and produce a single output bit whose value (1 or 0) is 
based on a specific rule. In the same way that different arithmetic operators 
produce different outputs for the same two inputs (for instance, three plus 
two produces five, while three minus two produces one), different types of 
logic gates produce different outputs for the same inputs:
