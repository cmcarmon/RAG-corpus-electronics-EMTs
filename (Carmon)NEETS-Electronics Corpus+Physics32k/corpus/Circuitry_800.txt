Earlier  in  Chapter  11  we  introduced  the  PIC 
microcontroller as a device that is normally used in 
stand-alone (or embedded) applications to perform 
simple  logic,  timing  and  input/output  control.  In 
recent years such devices have become increasingly  
sophisticated  in  terms  of  both  the  variety  of  I/O 
peripheral  facilities  provided  and  the  ability  to 
connect  to  other  devices  in  bus  and  networked 
configurations. This latter feature makes it possible 
to have several  microcontrollers  working together, 
exchanging  data  and  control 
in 
distributed  systems  that  can  be  of  virtually  any 
size.
