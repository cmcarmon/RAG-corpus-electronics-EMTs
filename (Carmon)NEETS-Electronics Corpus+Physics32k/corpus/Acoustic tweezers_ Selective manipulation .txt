While most acoustic tweezers are able to manipulate a large number of objects at once, a complementary function is to selectively manipulate one object within a cluster of identical ones. This requires specific acoustic fields. Single beam tweezers have been developed in this aim, based either on highly focused acoustic beams  or bessel beams. Alternatively, nanosecond-scale pulsed fields can be used to selectively generate localized acoustic standing waves. Manipulation of small objects in aqueous solutions is achieved by dipping the transducer in the fluid. Non-invasive methods using spiral-shaped interdigitated transducers have also been proposed. In this case, the transducer is flat and is placed below the sample. This type of device allows patterning dozens of microscopic particles on a microscope slide.
