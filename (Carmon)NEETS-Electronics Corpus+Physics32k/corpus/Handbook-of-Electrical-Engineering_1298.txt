Example 8.  Let  us  apply  the  above  signal  restoration  procedure  to  model  recursively  an  unknown  system
when  the  input  signal  x(n)  and  a  noisy  observation  of  the  output  signal  y(n)  are  available.  The  previously
described  signal-enhanced  data  modeling  technique  will  be  used  with  p  =  q  for  simplicity.  Clearly,  if  the
excitation-response data were noiseless and the unknown system could be modeled by an autoregressive moving
average (ARMA) (p,p) system, Dp,p would not have full rank. The presence of noise in the response data will
cause Dp,p to have full rank, and the signal restoration algorithm will be applied to produce a block Toeplitz
matrix having nullity s = 1. Since the input data is known exactly, its block will be inserted after each low rank
approximation step. From (14.145) above it is clear that the resulting solution for the ap and bp coefÔ¨Åcients will
consist of the eigenvector associated with the zero eigenvalue of D*p,pDp,p.
