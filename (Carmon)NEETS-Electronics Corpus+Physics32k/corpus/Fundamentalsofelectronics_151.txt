Similar to voltage divider (p. 38) for series resistances, we have current divider for parallel resistances.
The current through a resistor in parallel with another is the ratio of the conductance of the Ô¨Årst to the
sum of the conductances. Thus, for the depicted circuit, i2 =
i. Expressed in terms of resistances,
current divider takes the form of the resistance of the other resistor divided by the sum of resistances:
