If we take a look at a simple, household electrical appliance such as a toaster with a conduc-
tive metal case, we can see that there should be no shock hazard when it is operating properly.
The wires conducting power to the toasterâ€™s heating element are insulated from touching the
metal case (and each other) by rubber or plastic.
