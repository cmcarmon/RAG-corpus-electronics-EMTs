In metrological (metrology = ”the science of measurement”) applications, where accuracy is
of paramount importance, highly precise ”standard” resistors are also equipped with four ter-
minals: two for carrying the measured current, and two for conveying the resistor’s voltage
drop to the voltmeter. This way, the voltmeter only measures voltage dropped across the pre-
cision resistance itself, without any stray voltages dropped across current-carrying wires or
wire-to-terminal connection resistances.
