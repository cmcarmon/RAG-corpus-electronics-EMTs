Moves/Adds/Changes and Increasing Mobility
The world economies will continue to develop interdependencies and, likewise, global competition. The increas-
ing competitive environment will demand greater worker mobility, changing assignments and reassignments,
changing work groups, and mission mobility. The demand to have information how we want it, when we want
it, and where we want it will be a strategic and competitive weapon. The need to improve efÔ¨Åciency and the
growing need for information will accelerate the adoption of wireless communications.
