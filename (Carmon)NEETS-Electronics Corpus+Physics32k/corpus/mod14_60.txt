All numbers to the left of the decimal point are whole numbers, and all numbers to the right of the
decimal point are fractional numbers. A whole number is a symbol that represents one, or more, complete
objects, such as one apple or $5. A fractional number is a symbol that represents a portion of an object,
such as half of an apple (.5 apples) or a quarter of a dollar ($0.25). A mixed number represents one, or
more, complete objects, and some portion of an object, such as one and a half apples (1.5 apples). When
you use any base other than the decimal system, the division between whole numbers and fractional
numbers is referred to as the RADIX POINT. The decimal point is actually the radix point of the decimal
system, but the term radix point is normally not used with the base 10 number system.
