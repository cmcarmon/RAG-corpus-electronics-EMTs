When a wave passes through one medium and encounters a medium having different characteristics,
three things can occur to the wave: (1) Some of the energy can be reflected back into the initial medium;
(2) some of the energy can be transmitted into the second medium where it may continue at a different
velocity; or (3) some of the energy can be absorbed by the medium. In some cases, all three processes
(reflection, transmission, and absorption) may occur to some degree.
