The one-bit memory element that we have discussed thus far is called a dynamic
one-bit memory element or a dynamic D-latch. It is dynamic in the sense that it
stores a value written into it only for a finite amount of time (due to nonzero
parasitic resistances in practical implementations). The static one-bit memory
element or a static D-latch is another type of memory element that has the same
logic properties as the dynamic D-latch, but can store a value written into it
indefinitely.
