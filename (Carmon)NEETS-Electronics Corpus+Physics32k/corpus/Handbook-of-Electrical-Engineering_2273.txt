Here  NA  denotes  the  concentration  of  immobile  acceptors  on  the  p  side  of  the  junction  and  ND  is  the
concentration of immobile donors on the n side of the junction. A depletion layer of immobile acceptors and
donors causes an electric ﬁeld E across the junction. For silicon, V0 is at room temperature T = 300(cid:176)K, typically
V0 = 0.67 V for an abrupt junction with NA = 1017 at/cm3 and ND = 1015 at/cm3. The depletion layer width is
typically about 4 mm, and the electric ﬁeld E is about 60 kV/cm. Note the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld across
the junction.
