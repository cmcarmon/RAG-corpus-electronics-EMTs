The conductor size is determined by the current. The elec-
tric ﬁeld on the conductor’s surface and at any other point in
space is determined by the voltage. For overhead lines, clear-
ances to ground are determined both by the voltage and
current. Heating produced by resistive heating of the con-
ductor causes it to sag between the support structures. The
electric ﬁeld on the surface of the conductor is inversely pro-
portional to the conductor diameter.
