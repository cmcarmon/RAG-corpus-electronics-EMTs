Classes
One of the central ideas of OO paradigm is data encapsulation
captured by the class concept. A class is essentially an abstract
data type with a name, a set of related data ﬁelds (or attri-
butes), and a set of operations on the data ﬁelds. It is straight-
forward to use a predicate to denote a data ﬁeld (structure)
and a transition to represent an operation in Petri nets. The
current value of a data ﬁeld is determined by the tokens of the
denoting predicate under the current marking. The meaning
or deﬁnition of an operation is speciﬁed by the constraint
associated with the denoting transition.
