Each IRIDIUM satellite, weighing approximately 689 kg (1,500 lb), will orbit above the earth at an altitude
of 420 nautical miles and communicate directly with subscriber equipment. Each of the satellites will function
like extremely tall cellular towers and will project tightly focused beams over the ground. The low-earth orbit
of  IRIDIUM  satellites  as  well  as  recent  advances  in  microelectronics  make  it  possible  to  communicate  with  a
handheld phone.
