Even though the exact representation of the nonsinusoidal, periodic wave requires an inﬁnite
number of terms in the Fourier series, a good approximation for engineering purposes can be
obtained with comparatively few ﬁrst terms, since the amplitude of the harmonics decreases
progressively as the order of the harmonic increases.
