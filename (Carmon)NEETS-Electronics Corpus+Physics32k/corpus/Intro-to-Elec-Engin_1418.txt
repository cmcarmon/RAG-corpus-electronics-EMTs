Referring to Figure 15.1.7, the half-wave dipole is a relatively narrow-band antenna with
its radiated wave linearly polarized. The dipole can be driven by a transmission line of 75-
characteristic impedance. The folded half-wave dipole (a variation of the half-wave dipole) is
used in television, broadcast FM, and other applications. This antenna is well suited for use with
300- television cable. The helical antenna of Figure 15.1.7(c) yields a pencil-beam pattern in
the axis of the helix with circular wave polarization.
