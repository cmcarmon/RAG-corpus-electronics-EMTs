Several optical carriers can simultaneously propagate along the same ﬁber. Such wavelength-division mul-
tiplexed (WDM) links further increase the capacity of the system. Systems using two or three optical carriers
are common. Adding more than a few channels (8 or so) puts strong constraints on the multiplexers and light
sources. In long systems wideband optical ampliﬁers are preferred over regenerators for WDM systems because
a single ampliﬁer can boost all the individual carriers simultaneously while separate regenerators are needed
for each carrier wavelength.
