Other types of couplers are based on distributed electromag-
netic coupling between lines. In such cases, the mechanism
of line-to-line coupling is important. 1-to-N way dividers or
N-to-l way combiners present a class of alternative structures
to directional couplers or hybrids for achieving equal or non-
equal power dividing/combining functions. They are widely
used in the design of multicell power ampliÔ¨Åers and feeding
networks of antenna arrays. Among them, the Wilkinson
power divider/combiner is the most prominent.
