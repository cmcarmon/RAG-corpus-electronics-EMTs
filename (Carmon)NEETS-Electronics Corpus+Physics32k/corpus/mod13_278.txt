Boolean algebra is used primarily by design engineers. Using this system, they are able to arrange
logic gates to accomplish desired tasks. Boolean algebra also enables the engineers to achieve the desired
output by using the fewest number of logic gates. Since space, weight, and cost are important factors in
the design of equipment, you would usually want to use as few parts as possible.
