Data transmission between two stations can be achieved in either simplex, half-duplex, or
full-duplex mode. In a simplex mode, mainly used in radio and TV broadcasts, information travels
only in one direction. This mode is rarely used in data communications. In half-duplex mode, used
by radio communications, information may travel in both directions, but only in one direction at
a time. The transmitter becomes the receiver and vice versa. In a full-duplex mode, information
may travel in both directions simultaneously. This mode, used in telephone systems, adopts two
different carrier frequencies.
