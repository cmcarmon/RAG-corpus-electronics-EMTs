The preferred method of removing insulation is with a wire-stripping tool, if available. A sharp knife 
may also be used. Other typical wire strippers in use in the Navy are illustrated in figure 2-1. The hot-
blade, rotary, and bench wire strippers (views A, B, and C, respectively) are usually found in shops where 
large wire bundles are made. When using any of these automatic wire strippers, follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for adjusting the machine; this avoids nicking, cutting, or otherwise damaging the conductors. 
The hand wire strippers are common hand tools found throughout the Navy. The hand wire strippers 
(view D of figure 2-1) are the ones you will most likely be using. Wire strippers vary in size according to 
wire size and can be ordered for any size needed.
