On the surface, industrial radio telemetry seems to be simply a matter of hardware. It almost is, except that
the functional requirements are a lot different from those in missile and space telemetry. Distances are much
shorter, a matter of a few feet to a few hundred yards; signal power can be radiated directly from the transmitter
circuitry or from an antenna as simple as an inch or two of wire. Most tests are repeatableâ€”no missile blowing
