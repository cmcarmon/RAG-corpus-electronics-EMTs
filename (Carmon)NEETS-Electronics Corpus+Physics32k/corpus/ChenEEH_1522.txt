By convention, many programs expect ﬁle names to consist
of a base name and an extension separated by a dot (which
counts as a character). Thus prog.c is typically a C program,
prog.o is usually a compiled object ﬁle, and a.out is normally
an executable compiled object program. These conventions are
not enforced by the operating system.
