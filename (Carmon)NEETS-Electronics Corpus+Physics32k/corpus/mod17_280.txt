As compared to permanent magnet speakers, standard headphones are considered to be high-
impedance devices. Headphone electromagnets are normally wound with many turns of small wire, which
provide the larger impedance. Because of the physically small size and inflexibility of the metal
diaphragm, the headphones often give poor response to the lower audio frequencies. In the voice range of
audio, most standard issue headphones are adequate.
