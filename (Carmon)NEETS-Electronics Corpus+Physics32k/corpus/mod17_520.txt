All earth terminal transmitters generate high-power signals for transmission to the communications 
satellites. High-powered transmitters and highly directional, high-gain antennas are combined in this 
configuration. This is necessary to overcome up-link limitations and to ensure that the signals received by 
the satellite are strong enough to be detected by the satellite. Each transmitter has an exciter/modulator 
and a power amplifier. The modulator accepts the input signal from the terminal equipment and 
modulates an IF carrier. The exciter translates the IF signal to the up-link frequency and amplifies it to the 
level required by the power amplifier.
