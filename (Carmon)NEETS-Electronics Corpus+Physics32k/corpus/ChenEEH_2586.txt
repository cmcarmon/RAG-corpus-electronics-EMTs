and frequency modulation schemes. The group delay is also
usually used to measure how long it takes for the signal to pass
through the Ô¨Ålter (in seconds). The group delay is also usually
frequency dependent (dispersion). In addition, temperature
sensitivity may be a delicate issue of design considerations, in
particular for narrow band applications in all areas (e.g., com-
mercial, military, and satellite).
