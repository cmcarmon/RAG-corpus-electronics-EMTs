Now let’s add some two-digit numbers. To add 102 (addend) and 012 (augend), assume there are
numbers at the appropriate inputs. The addend inputs will be 1 on A2 and 0 on A1. The augend inputs will
be 0 on B2 and 1 on B1. Working from right to left, as we do in normal addition, let’s calculate the outputs
of each full adder.
