In the IF stage, the CW Doppler radar has a Doppler ﬁlter
bank, which is a bank of narrow band ﬁlters centered at
different frequencies. The center frequencies of the ﬁlters are
staggered to cover the entire range of Doppler frequencies. The
Doppler frequency is determined by the ﬁlter that has the
largest output.
