If the collector current IC is plotted against the collector-to-emitter voltage VCE, a family of curves for various
Ô¨Åxed values of VBE or IB results, as in Fig. 24.28. These curves show that as VCE increases, IC rises very rapidly
and then turns over as it is limited by IB. In the CE circuit, if IB were reduced to zero, then IC would also be
