Transistors, like vacuum tubes, have had a very limited application in the microwave range. Many of 
the same problems encountered with vacuum tubes, such as transit-time effects, also limit the upper 
frequency range of transistors. However, research in the area of microwave transistors, and especially 
MICROWAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ICs), is proceeding rapidly.
