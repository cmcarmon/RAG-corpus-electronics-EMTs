POLAR.â€”Polar operation differs from neutral operation in two ways. Current is always present in 
the polar system, and it is either positive or negative. A polar teletypewriter circuit contains the same 
items as a neutral circuit plus an additional "battery" source. The battery referred to here is not an actual 
battery but is a solid-state dc power supply. It provides variable current to the teletypewriters. The reason 
for having an extra battery source is because polar circuits use positive battery for marks and negative 
battery for spaces.
