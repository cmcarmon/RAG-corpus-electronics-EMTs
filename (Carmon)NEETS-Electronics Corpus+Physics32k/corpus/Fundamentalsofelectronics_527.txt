2Taking a systems viewpoint for the moment, a system that produces its output as rapidly as the input arises is said to
be a real-time system. All analog systems operate in real time; digital ones that depend on a computer to perform system
computations may or may not work in real time. Clearly, we need real-time signal processing systems. Only recently have
computers become fast enough to meet real-time requirements while performing non-trivial signal processing.
