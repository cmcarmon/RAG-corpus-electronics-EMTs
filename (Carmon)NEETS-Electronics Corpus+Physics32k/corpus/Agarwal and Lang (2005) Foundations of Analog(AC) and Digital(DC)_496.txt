Note that there is no restriction on the nature of the sources (other than frequency
limits, etc., as discussed in Chapter 1). The sources could be DC, sine waves or square
waves, speech, or a mixture of these. Equation 3.112 states that the output will be the
sum of these individual signals, each multiplied by a constant, a ‘‘scaling factor.’’ If the
inputs were four sine waves, each at a different frequency, then the output voltage would
be the sum of these four sinusoids, appropriately scaled. No other frequencies would be
present in the output signal. Thus a further consequence of linearity is that, whatever
frequencies are present at the input or inputs of a linear system, these and only these
frequencies will appear at the output.
