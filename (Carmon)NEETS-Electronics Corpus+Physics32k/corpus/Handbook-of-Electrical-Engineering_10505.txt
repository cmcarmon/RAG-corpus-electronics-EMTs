Perhaps one of the most famous patent lawsuits surrounded this patent applied for in 1879 by Selden,
who was more of a patent attorney than an inventor. He sold the patent to Col. Allen Pope in 1899 who
began  to  enforce  the  patent  and  won  judgments  against  several  car  manufacturersâ€”except  one.  They
were forced to pay royalties on all vehicles they produced.
