Closed	circuit	–	it	is	a	circuit	that	is	fully	functional
Open	circuit	–	it	is	a	circuit	that	can	no	longer	function	due	to	a	damaged	or
missing	component,	or	a	loose	connection
Short	circuit	–	it	is	a	circuit	that	comes	without	a	load
Parallel	circuit	–	it	is	a	circuit	that	connects	to	other	circuits;	it	is	like	the
main	power	source	or	the	primary	circuit	in	a	series	of	circuits
Series	circuit	–	it	is	a	circuit	that	connects	to	other	circuits;	the	same
amount	of	electricity	is	distributed	to	each	of	its	component	circuits;	the
main	power	source	or	the	primary	circuit	is	unclear
