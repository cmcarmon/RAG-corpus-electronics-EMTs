This is equivalent to the third term in Equation 3.102.
This example illustrates both the use of superposition to solve a network
with several sources, and also shows how primitives (elementary procedures)
can be used to solve circuits by inspection. Generalizing, we note that any messy
the one in Figure 3.35, for example must somehow yield
linear network
to straightforward network analysis and lead to a set of equations of the form
