The magnitude of lightning produced overvoltage is mainly
dependent on the lightning stroke current and impedence of
the object struck. For a stroke to a tower, the lightning strike
creates a traveling wave that travels down the tower and is
reﬂected at the footing and is reﬂected back. The sign of the
reﬂected wave depends on the relative tower footing resistance.
If the footing resistance is high, a voltage wave will be reﬂected,
which will be about double. This could raise the tower voltage
to a level that a ﬂashover could occur across the insulator. This
is referred to as back ﬂashover.
