Newton's description of gravity is sufficiently accurate for many practical purposes and is therefore widely used. Deviations from it are small when the dimensionless quantities φ/c2 and (v/c)2 are both much less than one, where φ is the gravitational potential, v is the velocity of the objects being studied, and c is the speed of light. For example, Newtonian gravity provides an accurate description of the Earth/Sun system, since

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Phi }{c^{2}}}={\frac {GM_{\mathrm {sun} }}{r_{\mathrm {orbit} }c^{2}}}\sim 10^{-8},\quad \left({\frac {v_{\mathrm {Earth} }}{c}}\right)^{2}=\left({\frac {2\pi r_{\mathrm {orbit} }}{(1\ \mathrm {yr} )c}}\right)^{2}\sim 10^{-8}}

where rorbit is the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
In situations where either dimensionless parameter is large, then general relativity must be used to describe the system. General relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity in the limit of small potential and low velocities, so Newton's law of gravitation is often said to be the low-gravity limit of general relativity.
