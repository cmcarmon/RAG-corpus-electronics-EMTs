The VARACTOR is a two-terminal diode that acts as a variable capacitance and is the active 
element of PARAMETRIC AMPLIFIERS. The parametric amplifier is a low-noise microwave amplifier 
that uses variable reactance to amplify microwave signals. The illustration shows an example of a 
NONDEGENERATIVE PARAMETRIC AMPLIFIER.
