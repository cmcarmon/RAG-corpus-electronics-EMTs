Hierarchies greatly facilitate the drawing and organization of diagrams. They provide appropriate levels of
abstraction so that individual diagrams can be understood without clutter from details. Hierarchies simplify
individual diagrams, making the resulting code easier to test. One can build up a set of subdiagram libraries
which  can  be  linked  into  possibly  several  higher  level  diagrams.  Some  block-diagram  editors  also  allow  the
mixing of various diagram types in a hierarchical fashion (e.g., to call a low-level signal-ﬂow diagram imple-
menting a control-law scheme from a decision-making ﬂow-chart diagram).
