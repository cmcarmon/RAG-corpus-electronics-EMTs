To make the problem treatable, we must start with a simple
network function and establish conditions that the function
must satisfy. The simplest network function is an impedance
(or admittance) but since one is the inverse of the other, we
can restrict ourselves to only one of them: the impedance. A
large amount of work went into establishing the necessary and
sufÔ¨Åcient conditions for an impedance function composed of
