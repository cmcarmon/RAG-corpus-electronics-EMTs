The essential feature of communication, control, computation, and instrumentation systems is
the processing of information. Because of the relative ease and ï¬‚exibility of processing and
transmitting electrical quantities, usually the information obtained from a nonelectrical source is
converted into electrical form. An electric signal is a voltage or current waveform whose time or
frequency variations correspond to the desired information. The information-bearing signals are
processed either for purposes of measurement in an instrumentation system, or for transmitting
over long distance in a communication system. All such systems, regardless of their particular
details, share certain basic concepts and common problems.
