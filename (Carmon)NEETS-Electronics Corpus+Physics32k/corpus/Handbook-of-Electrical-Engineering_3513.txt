The  physical  level  of  abstraction  involves  geometric  information  that  deﬁnes  electrical  devices  and  their
interconnection. Geometric information includes the shape of objects and how objects are placed relative to
each other. For example, Fig. 34.4 shows the geometric shapes deﬁning a simple complementary metal-oxide

and connections, called
