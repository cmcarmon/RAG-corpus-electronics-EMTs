where the term lt Bs in equation 4.55 is the sum of all equality
constraints for the product of the ith constraint times the
multiplier li.
Any extremum of e must be a stationary point of the
Lagrangian L(s, l) (Bretscher, 1996); that is, the ﬁrst deriva-
tives of L(s, l) with respect
and
lj j 2 {1, . . . , nc}, must be zero. Formally, if the differential
operator is denoted as r, then any stationary point (s, l) of
L(s, l) is a solution of the system of equations:
rL(s, l) ¼ 0 ) rsL(s, l) ¼ 0
rlL(s, l) ¼ 0:
