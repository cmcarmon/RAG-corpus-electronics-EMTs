The RULâ€™s are the principal stabilizers of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). There are two RUL's, the palmar and dorsal radioulnar ligaments.
These ligaments arise from the distal radius medial border and insert on the ulna at two separate and distinct sites: the ulna styloid and the fovea (a groove that separates the ulnar styloid from the ulnar head). Each ligament consists of a superficial component and a deep component. The superficial components insert directly onto the ulna styloid. The deep components insert more lateral, into the fovea adjacent to the articular surface of the pole of the distal ulna.
The ligaments are composed of longitudinally oriented lamellar collagen to resist tensile loads and have a rich vascular supply to allow healing.
