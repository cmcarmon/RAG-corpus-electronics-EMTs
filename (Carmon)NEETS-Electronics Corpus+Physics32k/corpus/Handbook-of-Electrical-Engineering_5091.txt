Kerr Effects
Kerr effects occur when a light beam is reﬂected from a magnetooptic medium. There are three distinct types
of Kerr effects, namely, polar, longitudinal (or meridional), and transverse (or equatorial). Figure 57.1 shows
the conﬁgurations of these Kerr effects. A reﬂectivity tensor relation between the incident light and the reﬂected
light can be used to describe the phenomena as follows:
