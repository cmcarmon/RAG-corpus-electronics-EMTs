The costs of metering include:
Investment costs to purchase, install and replace meters,
Recurring costs to read meters and issue bills based on consumption instead of bills based on monthly flat fees.
While the cost of purchasing residential meters is low, the total life cycle costs of metering are high. For example, retrofitting flats in large buildings with meters for every flat can involve major and thus costly plumbing work.
