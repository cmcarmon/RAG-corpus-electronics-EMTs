An even more efﬁcient way to implement the same combinational logic function would be to utilize part of
a simple programmable read only memory (PROM) circuit such as the 27S19 fuse programmable PROM in
Fig. 81.20. An equivalent architectural gate structure for a portion of the PROM is shown in Fig. 81.21. The
X’s in Fig. 81.21 represent fuses that are left intact after programming the device. The code for programming
the PROM or generating the truth table of the function can be read either from the truth table (Table 81.4) or
directly from each line of the circuit diagram in Fig. 81.21 (expressed in hexadecimal: 7E, 30, 6D, 79, 33, 5B,
5F,  70,  7F,  7B,  77,  1F,  4E,  3D,  4F,  and  47)  beginning  with  the  ﬁrst  line,  which  represents  binary  input  0000,
