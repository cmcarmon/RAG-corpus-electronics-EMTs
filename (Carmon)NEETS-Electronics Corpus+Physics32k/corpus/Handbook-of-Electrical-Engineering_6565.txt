where  G  is  the  detector’s  gain, h  is  its  quantum  efﬁciency  (close  to  0.9  for  good  photodiodes), h  is  Planck’s
constant (6.63 2 10–34 J s), e is the magnitude of the charge on an electron (1.6 2 10–19), and f is the optical
frequency. For pin photodiodes (G = 1), typical responsivities are on the order of 0.5 mA/mW.
