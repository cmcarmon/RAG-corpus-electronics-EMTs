The Wrawby Junction rail crash was a train crash which occurred on 9 December 1983, at Wrawby Junction, near Barnetby station in North Lincolnshire, England.
It happened when a freight train collided at low speed with the side of a local passenger train. The first carriage of the passenger train was derailed and turned over onto its side, and one passenger was killed instantly. In the subsequent inquiry, the accident was deemed to have been caused by a signalman failing to secure a set of points that he had operated manually after an equipment failure.
