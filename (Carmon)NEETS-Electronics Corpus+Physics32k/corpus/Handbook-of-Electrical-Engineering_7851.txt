along the other axis splits off and branches to the side. The PBS is oriented such that in the absence of the Kerr
effect its two branches will receive equal amounts of light. In other words, if the polarization, upon reï¬‚ection
from the disk, did not undergo any rotations whatsoever, then the beam entering the PBS would be polarized
at 45(cid:176) to the PBS axes, in which case it would split equally between the two branches. Under this condition,
the two detectors generate identical signals and the differential signal DS will be zero. Now, if the beam returns
from the disk with its polarization rotated clockwise (rotation angle = qk), then detector #1 will receive more
light  than  detector  #2,  and  the  differential  signal  will  be  positive.  Similarly,  a  counterclockwise  rotation  will
generate a negative DS. Thus, as the disk rotates under the focused spot, the electronic signal DS reproduces
the pattern of magnetization along the scanned track.
