Radio technologies form the platform for other wireless LAN products. Many of the radio LANs are based
on spread spectrum technology. This technology, developed by the U.S. military, uses a combination of several
small,  narrow  bands  within  a  general  region  of  this  band  as  carrier  frequencies.  However,  the  commercial
products  operate  with  fewer  frequencies  than  are  available  for  military  systems;  hence  interference  rejection
