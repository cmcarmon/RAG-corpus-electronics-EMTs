Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a velocimetry method i.e. a technique to measure velocity of particles that are resident in a fluid. As the name suggests, individual particles are tracked, so this technique is a Lagrangian approach. In contrast to particle image velocimetry (PIV), which is an Eulerian method that measures the velocity field of a fluid at a (rectangular) grid. There are two very different experimental methods:
the two-dimensional (2D) PTV, in which the flow field is measured in the two-dimensional slice of the flow, illuminated by a laser sheet (a thin plane) and low density of seeded particles allow for the tracking each of them individually for several frames.
the three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry (3D-PTV) is a distinctive experimental technique, based on multiple camera-system, three-dimensional volume illumination and tracking of flow tracers (i.e. particles) in three-dimensional space by using photogrammetric principles.
