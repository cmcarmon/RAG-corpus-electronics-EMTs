The constant K cannot be evaluated in the usual way (that is, setting vo = 0
for t = 0 and solving for K), because the two capacitors form a loop facing
the voltage source. Thus when the step is applied, in theory infinite current
flows through the capacitors for an instant, and the capacitor voltages change
instantaneously. Thus immediately after the step, at t = 0
+
, the initial condition
on vo will not be 0.
Instead, we can proceed as follows to find the initial condition at t = 0
+
.
Because the same current flows through each capacitor, both capacitors receive
equal charge:
