An  advantage  of  data  fusion  is  that  the  receivers  can  be  located  at  different  ranges  (e.g.,  on  two  different
ships), in different mediums (shallow or deep water, or even at the surface), and at different bearings from the
object, thus giving comprehensive information about the object or the underwater acoustic channel.
