11.2.6 The conﬁguration of a magnetic circuit is given in
Figure P11.2.6. Assume the permeability of the
ferromagnetic material to be µ = 1000µ0. Ne-
glect leakage, but correct for fringing by increas-
ing each linear dimension of the cross-sectional
area by the length of the air gap. The magnetic
material has a square cross-sectional area of 4
cm2. Find the air-gap ﬂux density, and the mag-
netic ﬁeld intensity in the air gap.
