Providing appropriate constructs in hardware description lan-
guages is necessary to support run-time reconﬁguration. Such
constructs are included in the Pebble language (Luk et al.,
1997), which can be viewed as a variant of the industrial
standard VHDL language. It is also possible to model the
reconﬁguration mechanism in VHDL (Lysaght and Dunlop,
1994) or in the Circal process algebra (Diessel and Milne,
2000). Currently, most design frameworks require the user to
specify the reconﬁguration sequence; at compile time, the
sequencing information can be extracted and used to guide
compilation (Shirazi et al., 2000).
