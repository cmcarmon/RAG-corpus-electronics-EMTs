2. Record oscillator circuit. This circuit generates a carrier signal onto which the input signal will be
modulated. The input signal is used to vary (frequency modulate) the carrier signal. This is how
the input signal gets frequency modulated onto the carrier signal. The output of this circuit is the
frequency-modulated carrier signal. The center frequency of the carrier depends on two things:
(a) the bandwidth of the signal you’re recording, and (b) the media onto which you’re recording.
For magnetic tape, the carrier frequency can be as low as 1.688 kHz for an operating tape speed
of 1-7/8 inches per second, and as high as 900 kHz for 120 inches per second.
