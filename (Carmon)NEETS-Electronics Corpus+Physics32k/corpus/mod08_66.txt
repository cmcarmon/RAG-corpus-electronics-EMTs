This chapter will use transistor amplifiers to present the concepts and principles of amplifiers. These 
concepts apply to vacuum-tube amplifiers and, in most cases, magnetic amplifiers as well as transistor 
amplifiers. If you wish to study the vacuum-tube equivalent circuits of the transistor circuits presented, an 
excellent source is the EIMB, NAVSEA 0967-LP-000-0120, Electronics Circuits.
