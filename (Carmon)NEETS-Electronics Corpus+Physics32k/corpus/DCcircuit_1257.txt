Convention, for some odd reason, has favored the metric preﬁx ”micro” in the measurement
of large capacitances, and so many capacitors are rated in terms of confusingly large micro-
Farad values: for example, one large capacitor I have seen was rated 330,000 microFarads!!
Why not state it as 330 milliFarads? I don’t know.
