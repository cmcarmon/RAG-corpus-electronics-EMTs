(13.174)
Hence the frequency Ï‰ = 1/RC is also called the half-power frequency of
the impedance, because the average power is one half of the value found in
Equation 13.151 for the capacitor being a short circuit. Note also that because
there is no average power dissipated in the capacitor, the average power dis-
sipated in the resistor must be identical to the average power supplied by the
source to the impedance.
