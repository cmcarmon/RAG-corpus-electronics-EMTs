This section presents some elementary analysis of the fundamental theoretical electromagnetic principles that govern the mechanics of railguns.
If a railgun were to provide a uniform magnetic field of strength



B


{\displaystyle B}
, oriented at right angles to both the armature and the bore axis, then, with an armature current



I


{\displaystyle I}
and an armature length




ℓ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\ell }}}
, the force



F


{\displaystyle F}
accelerating the projectile would be given by the formula:





F

=
I

ℓ

×

B



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}=I{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times {\boldsymbol {B}}}

Here the force, current and field are all treated as vectors, so the above vector cross product gives a force directed along the bore axis, acting on the current in the armature, as a consequence of the magnetic field.
In most simple railguns, the magnetic field



B


{\displaystyle B}
is only provided by the current flowing in the rails, i.e. behind the armature. It follows that the magnetic field will not be either constant or spatially uniform. Hence, in practice, the force must be calculated after making due allowances for the spatial variation of the magnetic field over the volume of the armature.
To illustrate the principles involved, it can be useful to consider the rails and the armature as thin wires or "filaments". With this approximation, the magnitude of the force vector can be determined from a form of the Biot–Savart law and a result of the Lorentz force. The force can be derived mathematically in terms of the permeability constant (




μ

0




{\displaystyle \mu _{0}}
), the radius of the rails (which are assumed to be circular in cross section) (



r


{\displaystyle r}
), the distance between the central axes of the rails (



d


{\displaystyle d}
) and the current (



I


{\displaystyle I}
) as described below.
First, it can be shown from the Biot–Savart law that at one end of a semi-infinite current-carrying wire, the magnetic field at a given perpendicular distance (



s


{\displaystyle s}
) from the end of the wire is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (s)={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{4\pi s}}{\widehat {\varphi }}}

Note this is if the wire runs from the location of the armature e.g. from x = 0 back to



x
=
−
∞


{\displaystyle x=-\infty }
and



s


{\displaystyle s}
is measured relative to the axis of the wire.
So, if the armature connects the ends of two such semi-infinite wires separated by a distance,



d


{\displaystyle d}
, a fairly good approximation assuming the length of the wires is much larger than



d


{\displaystyle d}
, the total field from both wires at any point on the armature is:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (s)={\frac {\mu _{0}I}{4\pi }}\left({\frac {1}{s}}+{\frac {1}{d-s}}\right){\widehat {z}}}

where



s


{\displaystyle s}
is the perpendicular distance from the point on the armature to the axis of one of the wires.
Note that






φ

{\displaystyle {\widehat {\varphi }}}
between the rails is






z
^





{\displaystyle {\widehat {z}}}
assuming the rails are lying in the xy plane and run from x = 0 back to



x
=
−
∞


{\displaystyle x=-\infty }
as suggested above.
Next, to evaluate the force on the armature, the above expression for the magnetic field on the armature can be used in conjunction with the Lorentz Force Law,

This shows that the force will be proportional to the product of




μ

0




{\displaystyle \mu _{0}}
and the square of the current,



I


{\displaystyle I}
. Because the value of μ0 is small (4π×10−7 H/m) it follows that powerful railguns need large driving currents.
The above formula is based on the assumption that the distance (



l


{\displaystyle l}
) between the point where the force (



F


{\displaystyle F}
) is measured and the beginning of the rails is greater than the separation of the rails (



d


{\displaystyle d}
) by a factor of about 3 or 4 (



l
>
3
d


{\displaystyle l>3d}
). Some other simplifying assumptions have also been made; to describe the force more accurately, the geometry of the rails and the projectile must be considered.
With most practical railgun geometries, it is not easy to produce an electromagnetic expression for the railgun force that is both simple and reasonably accurate. For a more workable simple model, a useful alternative is to use a lumped circuit model, to describe the relationship between the driving current and the railgun force.
In these models the railgun is modeled on an electrical circuit and the driving force can be determined from the energy flow in the circuit. The voltage across the railgun breech is given by




V
=




d

(
L
I
)



d

t



+
I
R


{\displaystyle V={\frac {{\text{d}}(LI)}{{\text{d}}t}}+IR}

So the total power flowing into the railgun is then simply the product



V
I


{\displaystyle VI}
. This power represents an energy flow into three main forms: kinetic energy in the projectile and armature, energy stored in the magnetic field,



B


{\displaystyle B}
and energy lost via electrical resistance heating of the rails (and armature).
As the projectile travels along the barrel, the distance from the breech to the armature increases. Hence the resistance and inductance of the barrel also increase. For a simple model, the barrel resistance and inductance can be assumed to vary as linear functions of the projectile position,



x


{\displaystyle x}
, so these quantities are modelled as




R

R
′

x


{\displaystyle R=R'x}





L

L

x


{\displaystyle L=L'x}

where




R

{\displaystyle R'}
is the resistance per unit length and




L

{\displaystyle L'}
is the inductance per unit length, or the inductance gradient. It follows that

where

Now, if the driving current is held constant, the

This simple model predicts that exactly half of the electromagnetic work will be used to store energy in the magnetic field along the barrel,

{\displaystyle L'xI^{2}/2}
, as the length of the current loop increases.
The other half of the electromagnetic work represents the more useful power flow - into the kinetic energy of the projectile. Since power can be expressed as force times speed, this shows the force on the railgun armature is given by




F
=




L
′


I

{\displaystyle F={\frac {L'I^{2}}{2}}}

This equation also shows that high accelerations will require very high currents. For an ideal square bore single-turn railgun, the value of




L
′



{\displaystyle L'}
would be about 0.6 microHenries per metre (



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
.H/m) but most practical railgun barrels exhibit lower values of




L
′



{\displaystyle L'}
than this. Maximizing the inductance gradient is but one of the challenges faced by the designers of railgun barrels.
Since the lumped circuit model describes the railgun force in terms of fairly normal circuit equations, it becomes possible to specify a simple time domain model of a railgun.
Ignoring friction and air drag, the projectile acceleration is given by








d

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\text{d}}v}{{\text{d}}t}}={\frac {L'I^{2}}{2m}}}

where m is the projectile mass. The motion along the barrel is given by








d

x



d

t



=
v


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\text{d}}x}{{\text{d}}t}}=v}

and the above voltage and current terms can be placed into appropriate circuit equations to determine the time variation of current and voltage.
It can also be noted that the textbook formula for the high frequency inductance per unit length of a pair of parallel round wires, of radius r and axial separation d is:





L

(

{\displaystyle L'={\frac {\mu _{0}}{\pi }}\ln \left({\frac {d-r}{r}}\right)}

{\displaystyle F={\frac {L'I^{2}}{2}}={\frac {\mu _{0}I^{2}}{2\pi }}\ln \left({\frac {d-r}{r}}\right).}

With practical railgun geometries, much more accurate two or three dimensional models of the rail and armature current distributions (and the associated forces) can be computed, e.g., by using finite element methods to solve formulations based on either the scalar magnetic potential or the magnetic vector potential.
