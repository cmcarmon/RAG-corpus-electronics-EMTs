In addition to providing sufÔ¨Åcient power to the receiver, the system must also satisfy the bandwidth require-
ments imposed by the rate at which data are transmitted. A convenient method of accounting for the bandwidth
is to combine the rise times of the various system components and compare the result with the rise time needed
for the given data rate and pulse coding scheme.
