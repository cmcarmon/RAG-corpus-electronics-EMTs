Document compilation programs are useful when you have standard paragraphs of information that 
you need to combine in different ways for various purposes. For example, you may be answering 
inquiries or putting together contracts or proposals. Once you select the standard paragraphs you want, 
you add variable information. This saves both keying and proofreading time.
