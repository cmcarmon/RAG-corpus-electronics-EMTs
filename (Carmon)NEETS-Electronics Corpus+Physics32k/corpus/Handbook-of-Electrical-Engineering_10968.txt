The solid curve labeled “current” is of the type that is most often represented as a strength-duration curve.
For this curve, the minimum threshold current occurs for long-stimulus durations and is called the rheobasic
current, or simply rheobase. The duration consistent with twice the rheobase is called the chronaxie. The solid
curve in Fig. 113.6 labeled “charge” gives the area under the rectangular current pulse. The threshold charge is
a minimum for short-duration stimuli.
