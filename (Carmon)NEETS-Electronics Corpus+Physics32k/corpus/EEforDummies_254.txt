You can observe how resistors limit current by setting up the circuit shown 
in Figure 5­2 and trying out resistors of different values. In the “Reading into 
fixed resistors” section, later in the chapter, I tell you how to decode the 
stripes on a resistor to determine its value. For now, I tell you what the ones 
you need look like.
