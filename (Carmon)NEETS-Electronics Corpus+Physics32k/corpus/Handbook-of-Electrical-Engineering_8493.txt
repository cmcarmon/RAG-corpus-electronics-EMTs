The selection of the quotient digit is done by satisfying that 0 Â£  Z < X at each step in the division process.
This  selection  is  a  crucial  part  of  the  algorithm,  and  the  best  known  are  restoring  and  nonrestoring division
algorithms. In the former the value of the tentative partial remainder  z(j) is restored after the wrong guess is
made of the quotient digit qj . In the latter this correction is not done in a separate step, but rather in the step
following.  The  best-known  division  algorithm  is  the  so-called  SRT  algorithm  independently  developed  by
Sweeney, Robertson, and Tocher. Algorithms for a higher radix were further developed by Robertson and his
students, most notably Ercegovac.
