The matrix inequality conditions of equation 9.11 represent a
set of constraints that must be satisﬁed for each u 2 Q; hence,
they represent an inﬁnite number of constraints. There are a
variety of methods to make the problem tractable. The most
attractive require a simple parameter-set geometry and linear
fractional parameter dependence. When Q is a polytope and
