Satellites act as central relay nodes, which are visible to a large number of users who must efﬁciently use the
limited power and bandwidth resources. For detailed discussions of access issues see Gagliardi [1991], Pritchard
et al.  [1993],  Miya  [1985],  Roddy  [1996],  and  Feher  [1983].  A  brief  summary  of  issues  speciﬁc  to  satellite
systems is now given.
