As in the Gaussian units, the Heaviside–Lorentz units (HLU in this article) use the length–mass–time dimensions. This means that all of the electric and magnetic units are derived units, dependent on the sizes of length and force.
Coulomb's equation, used to derive the unit of charge, is F = QQ/r2 in the Gaussian system, and F = qq/4πr2 in the HLU. The unit of charge then connects to 1 dyn cm2 = 1 esu2 = 4π hlu. The HLU charge is then √4π, larger than the Gaussian (see below), and the rest follows.
When dimensional analysis for the SI units is used, including ε and μ are used to convert units, the result gives the conversion to and from the Heaviside–Lorentz units. For example, charge is √εL3MT−2. When one puts ε = 8.854 pF/m, L = 0.01 m, M = 0.001 kg, and T = 1 second, this evaluates as 9.409669×10−11 C. This is the size of the HLU unit of charge.
Because the Heaviside–Lorentz units continue to use separate electric and magnetic units, an additional constant is needed when electric and magnetic quantities appear in the same formula. As in the Gaussian system, this constant appears as the electromagnetic velocity c.
