The light striking the surface of the solar cell im-
parts much of its energy to the atoms in the semi-
conductor material. The light energy knocks valence 
electrons from their orbits, creating free electrons.  
The electrons near the depletion region are drawn to the 
N-type material, producing a small voltage across the 
Pâ€“N junction. The voltage increases with an  increase in 
light intensity. All the light energy striking the solar cell 
does not create free electrons, however. In fact, the solar 
cell is a highly inefficient device, with a top  efficiency 
of 15% to 20%. The cell is inefficient when expressed in 
terms of electrical power output compared to the total 
power contained in the input light energy.
