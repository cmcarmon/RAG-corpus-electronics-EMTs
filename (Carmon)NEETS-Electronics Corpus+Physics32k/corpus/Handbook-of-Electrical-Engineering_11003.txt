All parts of the heart are capable of exhibiting rhythmic activity, there being a rhythmicity hierarchy from
the  SA  node  to  the  ventricular  muscle.  In  abnormal  circumstances  the  atria  and  ventricles  can  generate
spontaneous  beats.  Such  ectopic  excitations  do  not  ordinarily  propagate  normally,  and  therefore  the  ECG
waveforms are different. Figure 113.14(7) illustrates ventricular ectopic beats in which the Ô¨Årst (l) Q-S,T wave
arose at the apex and the second (2) R-S,T wave arose at the base of the ventricles. The coupled (bigeminus)
