The addition of such an inverse-cube force also changes the path followed by the particle. The path of the particle ignores the time dependencies of the radial and angular motions, such as r(t) and θ1(t); rather, it relates the radius and angle variables to one another. For this purpose, the angle variable is unrestricted and can increase indefinitely as the particle revolves around the central point multiple times. For example, if the particle revolves twice about the central point and returns to its starting position, its final angle is not the same as its initial angle; rather, it has increased by 2×360° = 720°. Formally, the angle variable is defined as the integral of the angular speed

A similar definition holds for θ2, the angle of the second particle.
If the path of the first particle is described in the form r = g(θ1), the path of the second particle is given by the function r = g(θ2/k), since θ2 = k θ1. For example, let the path of the first particle be an ellipse
