Stage having reaction more than half suggest that pressure drop or enthalpy drop in the rotor is more than the pressure drop in the stator for the turbine. The same follows for a pump or compressor. Thus in this case the rotor has a larger contribution to the total work extracted or work done. From the relation for degree of reaction,|C| α2 < β3 which is also shown in corresponding Figure 7.
