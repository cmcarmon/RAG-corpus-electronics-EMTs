The  interim  International  Space  Station  will  look  like  this.  In  the  right  fore-
ground is the U.S. laboratory module and the stationâ€™s airlock. In the center of
the horizontal string of modules is the FGB energy block. The solar power array
at the top is one of four that will provide power for the complete station. Below
the tower is the Russian-built universal docking module and, at bottom, one
of  two  crew  transfer  vehicles.  (Photo  courtesy  of  National  Aeronautics  and
