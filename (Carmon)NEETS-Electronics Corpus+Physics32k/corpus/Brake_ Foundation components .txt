Foundation components are the brake-assembly components at the wheels of a vehicle, named for forming the basis of the rest of the brake system. These mechanical parts contained around the wheels are controlled by the air brake system.
The three types of foundation brake systems are “S” cam brakes, disc brakes and wedge brakes.
