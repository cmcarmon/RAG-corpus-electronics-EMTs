A general plane wave reï¬‚ection and transmission problem
consists of an incident plane wave impinging on a multilayer
structure, as shown in Figure 3.2. An important special case is
the two-region problem shown in Figure 3.3. The incident
plane wave may be either homogeneous or inhomogeneous,
and any of the regions may have an arbitrary amount of loss.
The vector representing the direction of propagation for the
incident wave in Figures 3.2 and 3.3 is a real vector (as shown)
if the incident wave is homogeneous, but the analysis is valid
for the general case.
