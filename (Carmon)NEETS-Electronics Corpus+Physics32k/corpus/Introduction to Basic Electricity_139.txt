Printed	circuit	boards	(or	PCBs)	are	devices	that	enable	electrical	connectivity
even	in	an	“open”	environment;	within	their	system,	there	are	resistors,	inductors,
transformers,	capacitors,	conductors,	and	semi-conductors.	These	tools	support
high	component	density.	In	a	way,	printed	circuit	boards	are	referred	to	as	live
circuits.
Since	functioning	circuit	boards	can	be	rather	risky,	especially	when	exposed	to
extreme	environments,	they	are	packaged	accordingly.	In	most	cases,	these	devices
are	subjected	to	a	series	of	coating	procedures	and	are	dipped	in	acrylic,	wax,
polyurethane,	and	epoxy.
