The control system as described in the previous paragraphs
suffers from a serious drawback. Frequency will never return
to the nominal (i.e., desired point). Supplemental control
is needed to make the appropriate adjustments. One may
think of this as adjusting for the initial loss of rotating kinetic
energy when the load change Ô¨Årst occurred by modifying the
generator set points. This action must be coordinated among
the units.
