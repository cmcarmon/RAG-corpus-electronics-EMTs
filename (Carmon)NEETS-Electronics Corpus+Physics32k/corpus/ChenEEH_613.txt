The impact of arithmetic in a digital system is not only
limited to the deÔ¨Ånition of the architecture of arithmetic
circuits. Arithmetic affects several levels of the design abstrac-
tion because it may reduce the number of operations, the
signal activity, and the strength of the operators. The choice
of arithmetic may lead to substantial power savings, reduced
area, and enhanced speed.
