The crucial condition that must be satisﬁed to apply a
is whether
mantissa-based integer checksum test on f
f (mant(v)) ¼ mant(f (v)). To check if f is mantissa preserving,
we have to look at the basic ﬂoating point operations, such as
multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square-root,
and others, that f is composed of and see if they are mantissa
preserving. A binary operator
is said to be mantissa preserv-
ing if mant (a)
b). Let a ﬂoating point
number a be represented as a1  2a2 , where a1 is the mantissa
and a2 the exponent of a. Ignoring the position of the implicit
binary point (i.e., in terms of just the bit pattern of numbers),
ﬂoating point multiplication is mantissa preserving because:
mant(a) mant(b): ¼ a1  b1, while mant(a  b)
