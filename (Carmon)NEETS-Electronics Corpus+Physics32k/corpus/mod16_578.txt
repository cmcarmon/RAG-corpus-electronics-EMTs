As you have seen in the previous illustrations, the beam of electrons passes through an electrostatic
field between two plates. You should remember that electrons are negatively charged and that they will be
deflected in the direction of the electric force (from negative to positive). This deflection causes the
electrons to follow a curved path while in the electrostatic field.
