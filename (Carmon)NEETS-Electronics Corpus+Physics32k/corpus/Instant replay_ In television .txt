In television broadcasting of sports events, instant replay is often used during live broadcast, to show a passage of play which was important or remarkable, or which was unclear on first sight.
Replays are typically shown during a break or lull in the action; in modern telecasts, it will be the next break, though older systems were sometimes less instant. The replay may be in slow motion, or from multiple camera angles.
Video servers, with their advanced technology, have allowed for more complex replays, such as freeze frame, frame-by-frame review, replay at variable speeds, overlaying of virtual graphics, instant analysis tools such as ball speed or immediate distance calculation. Sports commentators analyze the replay footage when it is being played, rather than describing the concurrent live action.
Instant replays are used today in broadcasting extreme sports, where the speed of the action is too high to be easily interpreted by the naked eye, using combinations of advanced technologies such as video servers and high-speed cameras recording at up to several thousand frames per second.
EVS Broadcast Equipment is the industry leader in Replay Production Servers  and is the preferred system of major broadcasters for large events such as the Olympics, Super Bowl, MLB Playoffs, and NBA Playoffs.
Evertz Microsystem's DreamCatcher  replay system is also widely used for lower level productions by College and Pro Sports clubs including the NBA, MLB.
