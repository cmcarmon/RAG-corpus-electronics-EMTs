4. Mixing TTL subfamilies. Even synchronous sequential systems often have asynchronous features such
as reset, preset, load, and so on. Mixing high-speed 74S TTL with lower speed TTL (74LS for example)
in some applications can cause timing problems resulting in anomalous behavior. Such mixing is to be
avoided, with rare exceptions which must be carefully analyzed.
