NGC 5806 contains a star that was catalogued as a supernova (SN Hunt 248), but turned out to be a supernova imposter. The progenitor was detected as a cool hypergiant with an absolute visual magnitude of −9 and 400,000 times more luminous than the sun. The eruption saw it increase in luminosity to around 80,000,000 L☉.
