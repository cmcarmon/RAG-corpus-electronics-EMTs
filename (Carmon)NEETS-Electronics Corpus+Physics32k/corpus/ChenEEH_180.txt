LC two-port from the loading resistors and apply synthesis to
Ô¨Ånd the elements of the LC two-port. Again, as could be
expected, some restrictions apply for the overall network, but
the conditions are much more relaxed than for the imped-
ances. A voltage or current transfer function can be realized as
an LC two-port with loading resistors if the following state-
ments are true:
