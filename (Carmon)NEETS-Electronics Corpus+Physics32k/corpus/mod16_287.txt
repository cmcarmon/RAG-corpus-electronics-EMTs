Transistors have little tendency to burn or change value because of low voltage in their circuits. They
can, however, be permanently damaged by high-voltage conditions that occur when the collector voltage
is increased. They can also be permanently damaged when the ambient temperature increases and causes
excessive collector current flow. Transistors are easily damaged by high current; therefore, resistance
measurements must not be taken with an ohmmeter that provides a maximum current output in excess of
1 milliampere. If you are not sure that the range of ohmmeter you want to use is below the 1 milliampere
level, connect the ohmmeter to a milliammeter and check it. See figure 2-19 for a method of measuring
the current from an ohmmeter.
