In quantum mechanics an object or body is a particle or collection of particles. Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a probability distribution of finding the particle at a particular position. There is a limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured. A particle or collection of particles is described by a quantum state.
These ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is. Object/particle identity is shared between common usage and quantum mechanics, although in quantum mechanics some particles may occupy the same position at the same time (e.g. photons).
