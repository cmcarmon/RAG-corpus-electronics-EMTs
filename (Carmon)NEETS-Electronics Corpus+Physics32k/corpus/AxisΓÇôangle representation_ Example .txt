Say you are standing on the ground and you pick the direction of gravity to be the negative z direction. Then if you turn to your left, you will rotate π/2 radians (or 90°) about the z axis. Viewing the axis-angle representation as an ordered pair, this would be




(

a
x
i
s

,

a
n
g
l
e

)
=

.


{\displaystyle (\mathrm {axis} ,\mathrm {angle} )=\left({\begin{bmatrix}e_{x}\\e_{y}\\e_{z}\end{bmatrix}},\theta \right)=\left({\begin{bmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{bmatrix}},{\frac {\pi }{2}}\right).}

The above example can be represented as a rotation vector with a magnitude of π/2 pointing in the z direction,
