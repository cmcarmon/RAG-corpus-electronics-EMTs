Advantages and Disadvantages
Input devices make up one of the functional groups of the display systems, and their technical characteristics
are covered in some detail at the beginning of this chapter, with performance information provided in Table 89.5
containing characteristic parameter values for each type, as available. The following material expands somewhat
on that information by placing these devices in the context of a full graphics display system and evaluating the
functions that the various types of input devices perform in that type of system in terms of their advantages
and disadvantages. It is of some interest to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each type at this point,
as listed in Table 89.6. This is an imposing list and may be used to aid in choosing the best input devices for
speciÔ¨Åc applications. It also concludes this section on input devices.
