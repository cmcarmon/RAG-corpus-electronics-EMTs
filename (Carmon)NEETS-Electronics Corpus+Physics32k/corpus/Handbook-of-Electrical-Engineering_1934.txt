Parallel Processing
Parallel  processing
  is  related  to  pipelining  but  requires  replication  of  hardware  units.  Pipelining  exploits
concurrency by breaking a large task into multiple smaller tasks and by separating these smaller tasks by storage
units. On the other hand, parallelism exploits concurrency by performing multiple larger tasks simultaneously
in separate hardware units.
