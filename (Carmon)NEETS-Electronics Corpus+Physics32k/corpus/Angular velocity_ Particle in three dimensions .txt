In three-dimensional space angular velocity is a pseudovector quantity that specifies the rate at which the position vector "sweeps out" angle, as well as the orientation of the plane of angular displacement. Angular velocity in three dimensions has a magnitude, and a direction. The right-hand rule indicates the positive direction of the angular velocity pseudovector.
Let





u




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {u}}}
be a unitary vector perpendicular to the plane of angular displacement, so that from the top of the vector the angular displacement is counter-clock-wise. The angular velocity vector






ω
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
is then defined as:





ω

=



d
ϕ


d
t





u




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {d\phi }{dt}}{\mathbf {u} }}

Just as in the two dimensional case, a particle will have a component of its velocity along the radius from the origin to the particle, and another component perpendicular to that radius. The combination of the origin point and the perpendicular component of the velocity defines a plane of angular displacement in which the behavior of the particle (for that instant) appears just as it does in the two dimensional case. The direction normal to this plane is defined to be the direction of the angular velocity pseudovector, while the magnitude is the same as the pseudoscalar value found in the 2-dimensional case. Using the unit vector





u




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {u}}}
defined before, the angular velocity vector may be written in a manner similar to that for two dimensions:





ω

r

u




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {|{\mathbf {v} }|\sin(\theta )}{|{\mathbf {r} }|}}{\mathbf {u} }}

which, by the definition of the cross product, can be written:





ω

=





r

v

r

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}={\frac {{\mathbf {r} }\times {\mathbf {v} }}{|{\mathbf {r} }|^{2}}}}

and using this vector, it can be seen that the formula for the tangential velocity of the particle is:






v
