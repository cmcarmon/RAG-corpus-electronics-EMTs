where K1 is a constant and δr is the angle between the rotor mmf axis and the resultant ﬂux or mmf
axis. The rotor current ir is determined by the rotor-induced voltage (proportional to slip) and the
rotor impedance. Since the slip is small under normal running conditions, as already mentioned,
the rotor frequency fr = Sfs is very low (on the order of 3 Hz in 60-Hz motors with a per-unit slip
of 0.05). Hence, in this range the rotor impedance is largely resistive, and the rotor current is very
nearly proportional to and in phase with the rotor voltage; that is, the rotor current is very nearly
proportional to slip. An approximately linear torque–speed relationship can be observed in the
range of low values of slip in Figure 13.1.6. Further, with the rotor-leakage reactance being very
small compared with the rotor resistance, the rotor mmf wave lags approximately 90 electrical
degrees behind the resultant ﬂux wave, and therefore sin δr is approximately equal to unity.
