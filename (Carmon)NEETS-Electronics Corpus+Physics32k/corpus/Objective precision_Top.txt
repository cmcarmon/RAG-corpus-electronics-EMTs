In philosophy and second scholasticism, objective precision (Latin praecisio obiectiva) is the "objective" aspect of abstraction. Objective precision is the process by which certain features (the differentiae) of the real object of a formal concept are excluded from the comprehension of that concept; the object is thus being intentionally transformed into a universal objective concept. Objective precision is thus a process by which universal objective concepts arise. It is the "objective" aspect of the process of (total) abstraction or concept-formation.
