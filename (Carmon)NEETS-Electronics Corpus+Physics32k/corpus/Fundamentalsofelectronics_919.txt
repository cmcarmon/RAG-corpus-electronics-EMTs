This result astounded communication engineers when Shannon published it in 1948. Analog communi-
cation always yields a noisy version of the transmitted signal; in digital communication, error correction can
be powerful enough to correct all errors as the block length increases. The key for this capability to exist is
that the code’s eﬃciency be less than the channel’s capacity. For a binary symmetric channel, the capacity
is given by
