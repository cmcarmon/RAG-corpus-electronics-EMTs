In  X-ray  spectroscopy  for  microanalysis,  liquid-nitrogen  cooled  Si:Li  detectors  are  being  challenged  by
similarly sized HPGe detectors, but Si:Li detectors are still more widely used. Recent developments in specialized
low-noise  silicon  drift  detectors  and  CCD-based  detector  (see  Room  Temperature  Semiconductor  section)
designs that have yielded promising results at room temperature may Ô¨Ånd future application in liquid nitrogen-
cooled systems for microanalysis using X-ray spectroscopy.
