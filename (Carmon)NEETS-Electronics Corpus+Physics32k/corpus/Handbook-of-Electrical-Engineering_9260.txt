The phrase stress test is used to deﬁne a special kind of testing often carried out for real-time or embedded
software.  With  stress  testing,  the  software  is  executed  at  maximum  load  and  under  maximum  performance
levels, to ensure that it can meet critical timing requirements. The observed removal efﬁciency of stress testing
often exceeds 50% against timing and performance-related problems. Stress testing is normally carried out by
testing and performance specialists who are supported by fairly sophisticated test tool suites.
