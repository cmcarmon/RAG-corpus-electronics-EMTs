Switches are designed to work in many different environments from extreme high pressure, as in a
submarine, to extreme low pressure, as in a spacecraft. Other environmental conditions to consider are
high or low temperature, rapid temperature changes, humidity, liquid splashing or immersion, ice,
corrosion, sand or dust, fungus, shock or vibration, and an explosive atmosphere.
