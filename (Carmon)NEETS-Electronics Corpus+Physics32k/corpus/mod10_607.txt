Assume, for example, that a certain antenna used with a transmitter radiates a maximum amount of 
energy at right angles to the axis of the antenna, as shown in figure 4-7, view A. Note the minimum 
amount of radiation along the axis of the antenna. Now, if this same antenna were used as a receiving 
antenna, as shown in view B, it would receive best in the same directions in which it produced maximum 
radiation; that is, at right angles to the axis of the antenna.
