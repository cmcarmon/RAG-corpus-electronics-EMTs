It should be remembered, however, that equation 6.118 applies
for general conditions, where the polarization unit vectors are
referenced with respect to the coordinate systems of the cor-
responding antennas (see Figure 6.8) that in general can have
arbitrary relative orientation with respect to each other. It may
be useful to express Mp for a simpler situation, when the axes
(^xx1, ^yy1, ^zz1) and (^xx2, ^yy2, ^zz2) are respectively aligned with each
other (with different origins). With this situation, in the direc-
tion of communication between the antennas, ^uu1  ^uu2 ¼ 1, but
^ff1  ^ff2 ¼ -1:
Mp ¼ ^rr1  ^rr2 ¼ (r1u
