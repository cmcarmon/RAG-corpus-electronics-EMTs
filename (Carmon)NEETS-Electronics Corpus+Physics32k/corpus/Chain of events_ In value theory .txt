In value theory, it is the amount of cause and effects of the chain of events before generating intrinsic value that separates high and low grades of instrumental value. The chain of events duration is the time it takes to reach the terminal event. In value theory this is generally the intrinsic value (also called terminal value). It is contrasted with ethic value duration, which is the time that an object has any value intensity.
