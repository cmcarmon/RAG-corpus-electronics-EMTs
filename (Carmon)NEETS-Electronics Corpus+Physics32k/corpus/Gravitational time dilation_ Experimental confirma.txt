Gravitational time dilation has been experimentally measured using atomic clocks on airplanes. The clocks aboard the airplanes were slightly faster than clocks on the ground. The effect is significant enough that the Global Positioning System's artificial satellites need to have their clocks corrected.
Additionally, time dilations due to height differences of less than one metre have been experimentally verified in the laboratory.
Gravitational time dilation has also been confirmed by the Poundâ€“Rebka experiment, observations of the spectra of the white dwarf Sirius B, and experiments with time signals sent to and from Viking 1 Mars lander.
