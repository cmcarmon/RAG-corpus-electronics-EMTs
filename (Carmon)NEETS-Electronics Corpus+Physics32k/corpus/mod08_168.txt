Although the Navy uses television in many ways, video signals are used for more than television. Radar
systems (discussed later in this training series) use video signals and, therefore, video amplifiers. Video
amplifiers are also used in video recorders and some communication and control devices. In addition to
using video amplifiers, televisions use rf amplifiers. Many other devices also use rf amplifiers, such as
radios, navigational devices, and communications systems. Almost any device that uses broadcast, or
transmitted, information will use an rf amplifier.
