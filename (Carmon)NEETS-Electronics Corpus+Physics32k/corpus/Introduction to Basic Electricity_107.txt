In	the	physics	of	electricity,	Ohm’s	Law	is	important	where	quantitative
measurements	in	a	circuit	are	concerned.	Initially,	when	it	was	presented	to
German	scientists,	it	was	only	mocked	and	rejected	due	to	the	mere	fact	that	it
went	against	the	basic	understanding	of	electric	flow;	it	was	dismissed	as	“a	web
of	fancies”	and	worse,	Georg	Ohm	was	dubbed	as	a	“fancy	but	invaluable”	science
professor.	It	was	only	until	1840	when	it	earned	recognition	and	is	now	widely
used	today.
