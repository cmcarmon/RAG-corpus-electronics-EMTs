Compact disk (CD): A plastic substrate embossed with a pattern of pits that encode audio signals in digital
format.  The  disk  is  coated  with  a  metallic  layer  (to  enhance  its  reﬂectivity)  and  read  in  a  drive  (CD
player) that employs a focused laser beam and monitors ﬂuctuations of the reﬂected intensity in order
to detect the pits.
