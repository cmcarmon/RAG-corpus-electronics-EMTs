where PC designates the orthogonal projection operator onto the closed subspace C. Vector uo represents that
unique  vector  contained  in  the  closed  linear  variety V  which  lies  closest  to  the  origin  in  the  inner  product-
induced norm sense. With these thoughts in mind, the following lemma is readily proven.
