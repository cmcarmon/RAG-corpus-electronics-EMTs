Structure of Ferroelectric and Piezoelectric Materials
Ferroelectric materials have, as their basic building block, atomic groups which have an associated electric ﬁeld,
either as a result of their structure or as result of distortion of the charge clouds which make up the groups.
In  the  ﬁrst  case,  the  ﬁeld  arises  from  an  asymmetric  placement  of  the  individual  ions  in  the  group  (these
groupings are called unit cells). In the second case, the electronic cloud is moved with respect to the ionic core.
If the group is distorted permanently, then a permanent electric ﬁeld can be associated with each group. We
can think of these distorted groups as represented by electric dipoles, deﬁned as two equal but opposite charges
which are separated by a small distance. Electric dipoles are similar to magnetic dipoles which have the familiar
north and south poles. The external manifestation of a magnetic dipole is a magnetic ﬁeld and that of an electric
dipole an electric ﬁeld.
