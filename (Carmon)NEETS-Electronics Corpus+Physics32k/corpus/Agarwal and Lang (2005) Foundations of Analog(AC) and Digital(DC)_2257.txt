peak, the capacitor starts to discharge, but from Equation 16.14 this forces iD
to zero, and the diode changes to the OFF state. A simple exponential discharge
follows of the form given in Equation 16.10. At some later point in the cycle, the
input voltage rises up to the capacitor voltage, the constraint of Equation 16.13
is no longer met, and the diode switches back to the ON state.
