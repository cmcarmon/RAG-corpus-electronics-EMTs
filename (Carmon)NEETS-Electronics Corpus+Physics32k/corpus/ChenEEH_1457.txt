A key concept in all operating systems is the process. A process
is basically a program in execution. It consists of the executable
programs; the programâ€™s data and stack; its program counter,
stack pointer, and other registers; and all the other information
needed to run the program. In a time-sharing system, the
operating system periodically decides to stop running one
process and starts running another.
