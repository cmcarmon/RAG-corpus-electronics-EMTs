A rotameter requires no external power or fuel, it uses only the inherent properties of the fluid, along with gravity, to measure flow rate.
A rotameter is also a relatively simple device that can be mass manufactured out of cheap materials, allowing for its widespread use.
Since the area of the flow passage increases as the float moves up the tube, the scale is approximately linear.
Clear glass is used which is highly resistant to thermal shock and chemical action.
