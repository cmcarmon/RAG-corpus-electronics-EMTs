Each element of a tube is connected to a pin in its base. To trace a circuit easily and efficiently, you
must match elements with their pin numbers. This information is available in tube manuals and
equipment schematics. Figure 1-10 shows these numbers on one example of a diode symbol. You will
also note the designation V1 beside the tube. Electron tubes are often identified in schematic diagrams by
the letter V and a number.
