Figures 10.3 and 10.4 show the robustness of the controller
to system parameter uncertainties. Variations in Kd and K1 are
considered because they are crucial to controller design. Figure
10.3 gives the engine speed variations to a 15 Nm disturbance
after 20 engine cycles for Kd varying from 0.25 to 8. One can
see that the controller can stabilize the system and reject the
disturbance for all the cases. As Kd decreases, however, the
engine speed deviation from the nominal idle speed increases,
whereas the chattering becomes signiﬁcant when Kd increases.
Further increasing Kd would lead to instability. Figure 10.4
gives the engine speed for K1 ¼ 11 and 220. Increasing K1
would give higher chattering and even instability.
