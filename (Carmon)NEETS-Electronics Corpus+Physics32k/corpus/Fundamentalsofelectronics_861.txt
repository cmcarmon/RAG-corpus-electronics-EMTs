6.22 Compression and the Huﬀman Code29
Shannon’s Source Coding Theorem (6.52) has additional applications in data compression. Here, we have
a symbolic-valued signal source, like a computer ﬁle or an image, that we want to represent with as few
bits as possible. Compression schemes that assign symbols to bit sequences are known as lossless if they
obey the Source Coding Theorem; they are lossy if they use fewer bits than the alphabet’s entropy. Using
a lossy compression scheme means that you cannot recover a symbolic-valued signal from its compressed
version without incurring some error. You might be wondering why anyone would want to intentionally
create errors, but lossy compression schemes are frequently used where the eﬃciency gained in representing
the signal outweighs the signiﬁcance of the errors.
