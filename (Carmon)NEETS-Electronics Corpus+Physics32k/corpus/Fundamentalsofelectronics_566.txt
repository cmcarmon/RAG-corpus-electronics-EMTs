Exercise 5.8
(Solution on p. 191.)
This derivation assumed the signal’s amplitude lay in the range [−1, 1]. What would the amplitude
quantization signal-to-noise ratio be if it lay in the range [−A, A]?
Exercise 5.9
(Solution on p. 191.)
How many bits would be required in the A/D converter to ensure that the maximum amplitude
quantization error was less than 60 db smaller than the signal’s peak value?
Exercise 5.10
Music on a CD is stored to 16-bit accuracy. To what signal-to-noise ratio does this correspond?
