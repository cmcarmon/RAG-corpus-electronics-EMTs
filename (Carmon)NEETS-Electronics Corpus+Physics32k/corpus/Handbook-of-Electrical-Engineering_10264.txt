For  military  avionics  software,  the  principal  document  is  DOD-STD-498.  This  standard  deÔ¨Ånes  a  set  of
activities and documentation suitable for the development of both weapon systems and automated information
systems. Many software languages have been used in the past in avionics applications; however, today there is
a strong trend for both military and avionics civil software to use Ada wherever reasonably possible.
