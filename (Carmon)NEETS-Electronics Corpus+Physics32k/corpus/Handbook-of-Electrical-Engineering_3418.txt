 have a sample-and-hold ampliÔ¨Åer circuit built into the IC. This eliminates the need
for an external sample-and-hold circuit. The throughput of these A/D converter ICs ranges typically from 35
kHz  to  100  MHz.  The  speed  of  the  system  is  dependent  on  the  A/D  technique  used  by  the  sampling  A/D
converter.
