device simply holds the value of the signal until the next sample comes along. Two samplers with
two different sampling periods (T1 and T2) are shown in Figure 16.3.4(b), which is known as a
multirate sampled-data system. If the rate of variation of the signal in one loop is relatively much
less than that of the other loop, the sampling period of the sampler employed in the slower loop
can be larger. With sampling and multirate sampling, some of the expensive components of the
system can be utilized on a time-sharing basis.
