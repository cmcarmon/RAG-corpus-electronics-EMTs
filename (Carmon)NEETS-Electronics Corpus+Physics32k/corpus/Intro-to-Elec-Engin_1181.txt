Two three-phase, 6.6-kV, wye-connected synchronous generators, operating in parallel, supply a
load of 3000 kW at 0.8 power factor lagging. The synchronous impedance per phase of machine A
is 0.5+ j10 , and of machine B it is 0.4+ j12. The excitation of machine A is adjusted so that
it delivers 150 A at a lagging power factor, and the governors are set such that the load is shared
equally between the two machines. Determine the armature current, power factor, excitation
voltage, and power angle of each machine.
