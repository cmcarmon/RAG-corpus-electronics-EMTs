(Problem 3.43)), we ﬁnd a ready way of realizing designs. We now understand why op-amp implementations
of transfer functions are so important.
4.10 Modeling the Speech Signal16
The information contained in the spoken word is conveyed by the speech signal. Because we shall analyze
several speech transmission and processing schemes, we need to understand the speech signal’s structure
– what’s special about the speech signal – and how we can describe and model speech production. This
modeling eﬀort consists of ﬁnding a system’s description of how relatively unstructured signals, arising from
simple sources, are given structure by passing them through an interconnection of systems to yield speech.
For speech and for many other situations, system choice is governed by the physics underlying the actual
