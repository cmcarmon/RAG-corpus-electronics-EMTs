Silicon and germanium, for example, are the most frequently used semiconductors. Both are quite
similar in their structure and chemical behavior. Each has four electrons in the valence shell. Consider just
silicon. Since it has fewer than the required number of eight electrons needed in the outer shell, its atoms
will unite with other atoms until eight electrons are shared. This gives each atom a total of eight electrons
in its valence shell; four of its own and four that it borrowed from the surrounding atoms. The sharing of
valence electrons between two or more atoms produces a COVALENT BOND between the atoms. It is
this bond that holds the atoms together in an orderly structure called a CRYSTAL. A crystal is just
another name for a solid whose atoms or molecules are arranged in a three-dimensional geometrical
pattern commonly referred to as a lattice. Figure 1-7 shows a typical crystal structure. Each sphere in the
figure represents the nucleus of an atom, and the arms that join the atoms and support the structure are the
covalent bonds.
