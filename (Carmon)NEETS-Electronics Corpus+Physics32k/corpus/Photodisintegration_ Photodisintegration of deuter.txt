A photon carrying 2.22 MeV or more energy can photodisintegrate an atom of deuterium:

James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber used this reaction to measure the proton-neutron mass difference. This experiment proves that a neutron is not a bound state of a proton and an electron, as had been proposed by Ernest Rutherford.
