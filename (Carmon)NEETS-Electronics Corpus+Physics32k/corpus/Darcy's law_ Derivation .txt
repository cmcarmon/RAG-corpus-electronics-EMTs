For stationary, creeping, incompressible flow, i.e. D(ρui)/Dt ≈ 0, the Navier–Stokes equation simplifies to the Stokes equation:

,


{\displaystyle \mu \nabla ^{2}u_{i}+\rho g_{i}-\partial _{i}p=0\,,}

where μ is the viscosity, ui is the velocity in the i direction, gi is the gravity component in the i direction and p is the pressure. Assuming the viscous resisting force is linear with the velocity we may write:

{\displaystyle -\left(\kappa _{ij}\right)^{-1}\mu \varphi u_{j}+\rho g_{i}-\partial _{i}p=0\,,}

where φ is the porosity, and κij is the second order permeability tensor. This gives the velocity in the n direction,

{\displaystyle \kappa _{ni}\left(\kappa _{ij}\right)^{-1}u_{j}=\delta _{nj}u_{j}=u_{n}=-{\frac {\kappa _{ni}}{\varphi \mu }}\left(\partial _{i}p-\rho g_{i}\right)\,,}

which gives Darcy's law for the volumetric flux density in the n direction,

In isotropic porous media the off-diagonal elements in the permeability tensor are zero, κij = 0 for i ≠ j and the diagonal elements are identical, κii = κ, and the common form is obtained

The above equation is a governing equation for single phase fluid flow in a porous medium.
