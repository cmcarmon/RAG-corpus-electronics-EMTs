The v i curve for a switch is shown in Figure 6.3. Thus far, we drew the v i
curves for two-terminal devices by plotting the relationship between the voltage
and current for the two terminals. Likewise, for our three-terminal switch, we
can draw the v i characteristics at the input-output terminal pair. The effect of
the control terminal can be taken into account by drawing a different v i curve
for each value at the control terminal. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 6.3, when
the control input is a logical 0, the v i curve for the input-output terminal pair
indicates that the current through the switch is 0, irrespective of the voltage
applied. Conversely, the switch behaves like a short circuit between its input
and output terminals when the control input is a logical 1. When behaving like
a short circuit, the voltage across the input and output terminals is zero, and the
current is unconstrained by the switch (rather, it is determined by constraints
that are external to the switch).
