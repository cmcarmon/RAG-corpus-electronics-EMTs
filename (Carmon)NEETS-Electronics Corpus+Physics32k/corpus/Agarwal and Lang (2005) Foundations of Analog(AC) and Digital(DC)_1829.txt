Is the zero-input response of the circuit in Figure 12.69 under-
damped, over-damped, or critically-damped? (Provide some kind of justification for your
answer, either a calculation or a sentence of explanation.)
L − 1 µH C = 0.01 µF and R1 = R2 = 15 

In the circuit in Figure 12.70, the inductor current and capacitor
voltage have been constrained by some external magic to be iL = 5 A, vC = −6 volts.
At t = 0, the external restraints are removed, and the natural response of the circuit is
allowed to evolve. Find the initial slopes of the state variables.
