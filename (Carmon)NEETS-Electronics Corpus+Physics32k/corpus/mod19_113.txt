Probably the most important aspect is the extent of the burned area. A first degree burn covering a 
large area could be more serious than a small third degree burn. A sunburn, for example, ranging from 
mild to serious, is easily obtained, particularly if you are not accustomed to the exposure. If you were to 
fall asleep while sunbathing, second degree burns, or even third degree burns of a possibly fatal nature, 
could result.
