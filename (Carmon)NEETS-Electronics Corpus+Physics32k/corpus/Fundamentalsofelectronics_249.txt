When we add together the element power terms, we discover that once we collect terms involving a particular
node voltage, it is multiplied by the sum of currents leaving the node minus the sum of currents entering.
For example, for node b, we have eb (i3 âˆ’ i1). We see that the currents will obey KCL that multiply each
