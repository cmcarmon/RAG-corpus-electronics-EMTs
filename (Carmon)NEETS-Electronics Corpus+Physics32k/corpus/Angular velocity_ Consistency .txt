We have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, which means that the angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.

See the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is O, while O1 and O2 are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is





v


1




{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{1}}
and





v


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{2}}
respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to O1 and O2 is





ω


1




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{1}}
and





ω


2




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{2}}
respectively. Since point P and O2 have only one velocity,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{2}=\mathbf {v} _{1}+{\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{1}\times \mathbf {r} =\mathbf {v} _{1}+{\boldsymbol {\omega }}_{1}\times (\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _{2})}

The above two yields that

) is arbitrary, it follows that

If the reference point is the instantaneous axis of rotation the expression of velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.
