indexing and retrieval are instead performed on the basis of
media content itself. There have been extensive studies on the
design of automatic content-based indexing and retrieval
(CBIR) systems. For visual media, these contents may include
color, shape, texture, and motion. For audio/speech data,
contents may include phonemes, pitch, rhythm, and cepstral
coefﬁcients. Studies of human visual perception indicate that
there exists a gradient of sophistication in human perception,
ranging from seemingly primitive inferences (e.g., shapes, tex-
tures, and colors), to complex notions of structures (e.g.,
chairs, buildings, and affordances), and to cognitive processes
(e.g., recognition of emotions and feelings). Given the multi-
disciplinary nature of the techniques for modeling, indexing,
and retrieval of multimedia data, efforts from many different
communities of engineering, computer science, and psych-
ology have merged in the advancement of CBIR systems. But
the ﬁeld is still in its infancy and calls for more coherent efforts
to make practical CBIR systems a reality. In particular, robust
techniques are needed to develop semantically rich models to
represent data, computationally efﬁcient methods to compress,
index, retrieve, and browse the information; and semantic
visual interfaces integrating the above components into viable
multimedia systems.
