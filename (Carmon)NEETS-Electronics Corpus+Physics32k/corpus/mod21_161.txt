You usually test a crossed-field amplifier (cfa) tube while it is in the equipment in which it is used.
Like the klystron, if you do not operate the cfa for more than a few months, the tube may become gassy.
If a cfa tube is suspected of being gassy, we recommend that you consult the technical manual for the
particular piece of equipment in which the crossed-field amplifier is used.
