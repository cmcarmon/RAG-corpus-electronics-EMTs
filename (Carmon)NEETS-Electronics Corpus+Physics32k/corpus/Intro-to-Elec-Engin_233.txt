since the time-average values of the terms cos 2ωt and sin 2ωt are zero. Note that φ is the angle
associated with the impedance, and is also the phase angle between the voltage and the current.
The term cos φ is called the power factor. An inductive circuit, in which the current lags the
voltage, is said to have a lagging power factor, whereas a capacitive circuit, in which the current
leads the voltage, is said to have a leading power factor. Notice that the power factor associated
with a purely resistive load is unity, whereas that of a purely inductive load is zero (lagging) and
that of a purely capacitive load is zero (leading).
