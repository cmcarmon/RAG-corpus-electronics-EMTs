A model of form equation 3.8 driven by a zero-mean,
uncorrelated (white) sequence, it is called an autoregressive
(AR) model by time-series analysts. The output of an AR
model of order M, denoted AR(M),
is said to ‘‘(linearly)
regress on itself,’’ meaning that the present value sn is a linear
combination of (or a prediction based on) its past M values
plus a component, H0en, which is not predictable from any
data, past or future.
