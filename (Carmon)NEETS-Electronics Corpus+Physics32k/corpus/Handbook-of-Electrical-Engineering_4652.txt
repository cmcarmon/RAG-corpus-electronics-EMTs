, determines the electroacoustic coupling efﬁciency. This determines the fractional
bandwidth versus minimum insertion loss for a given material and ﬁlter. The static capacitance is a function
of the transducer electrode structure and the dielectric properties of the substrate. The values given in the table
correspond to the capacitance per pair of electrodes having quarter wavelength width and one-half wavelength
,  is  a  function  of  the  material,  cut  angle,  and  propagation  direction.  The
period.  The  free  surface  velocity, 
temperature coefﬁcient of delay (TCD) is an indication of the frequency shift expected for a transducer due to
a change of temperature and is also a function of cut angle and propagation direction.
