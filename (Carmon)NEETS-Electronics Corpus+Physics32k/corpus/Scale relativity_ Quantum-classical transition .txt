As Philip Turner summarized:

the structure of space has both a smooth (differentiable) component at the macro-scale and a chaotic, fractal (non-differentiable) component at the micro-scale, the transition taking place at the de Broglie length scale.

This transition is explained with Galilean scale relativity (see also above).
