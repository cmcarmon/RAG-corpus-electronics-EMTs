Ac and Bc are, respectively, the incidence and circuit matrices of
the directed graph representing N, Ie, and Ve, respectively, and
these are the column vectors of element currents and voltages in
N. Because each row in the cut matrix Qc can be expressed as a
linear combination of the rows of the matrix, in the above Ac
can be replaced by Qc. Thus, the result is as follows:
