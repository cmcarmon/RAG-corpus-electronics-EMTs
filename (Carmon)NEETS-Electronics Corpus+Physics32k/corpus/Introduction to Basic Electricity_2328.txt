capacitance is the ability of a device to store elec-
trical energy in an electrostatic field. The symbol 
for  capacitance is c. A capacitor is a device that pos-
sesses a specific amount of capacitance. A capacitor 
is made of two conductors separated by an insulator 
(Figure 20-1). The conductors are called plates and 
the insulator is called a dielectric. Figure 20-2 shows 
the symbols for capacitors.
