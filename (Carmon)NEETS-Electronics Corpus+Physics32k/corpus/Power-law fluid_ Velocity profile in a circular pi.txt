Just like a Newtonian fluid in a circular pipe gives a quadratic velocity profile (see Hagen–Poiseuille equation), a power-law fluid will result in a power-law velocity profile,

{\displaystyle u(r)={\frac {n}{n+1}}\left({\frac {dp}{dz}}{\frac {1}{2K}}\right)^{\frac {1}{n}}\left(R^{\frac {n+1}{n}}-r^{\frac {n+1}{n}}\right)}

where u(r) is the (radially) local axial velocity, dp/dz is the pressure gradient along the pipe, and R is the pipe radius.
