 The COEFFICIENT OF COUPLING between two coils is equal to the ratio of the flux cutting one 
coil to the flux originated in the other coil. If the two coils are so positioned with respect to each other so 
that all of the flux of one coil cuts all of the turns of the other, the coils are said to have a unity coefficient 
of coupling. It is never exactly equal to unity (1), but it approaches this value in certain types of coupling 
devices. If all of the flux produced by one coil cuts only half the turns of the other coil, the coefficient of 
coupling is 0.5. The coefficient of coupling is designated by the letter K.
