A Constantly Computed Impact Point (CCIP) related to the Continually Computed Release Point (CCRP) is a calculation provided by a weapon's sighting system. It is a predicted point of impact found from the launch platform's movement, the target's movement, gravity, projectile launch velocity, projectile drag, and other factors that can be entered. It is usually displayed on the Heads Up Display (HUD).
The HUD crosshairs will move around dependent on where the computer predicts the selected rocket, bullet or bomb will hit. Normally a radar lock is necessary, but when strafing or bombing a ground target (A/G mode; A/A mode will simply put the hairs in the centre of the HUD), the crosshairs will move along the ground.
This system is normally used in aircraft, other large vehicles, or large static weapons, but it is in principle possible for such a system to be miniaturized for a man-portable firearm.
CCIP calculation is sometimes combined with an autorelease system so that an aircraft can lock a low-drag bomb onto a target from a safe distance, then release it while in a high-G climb (the target would not be visible over the aircraft's nose), without the need to overfly the target.

In the Xbox 360 arcade game, Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation, the HUD of the aircraft contains a circular crosshair with a line resembling half a parabola for when equipped with th Un-Guided Bomb (UGB), whilst it uses two separate; horizontal lines when equipped with Self-Forging-Fragment-System (SFFS); practically a bomblet dispenser.
