A Flettner rotor is a smooth cylinder with disc end plates which is spun along its long axis and, as air passes at right angles across it, the Magnus effect causes an aerodynamic force to be generated in the third dimension.
In a rotor ship the rotors stand vertically and lift is generated at right angles to the wind, to drive the ship forwards.
In a rotor airplane the rotor extends sideways in place of a wing and upwards lift is generated.
