When the current through an inductor is increased, it drops a voltage opposing the direction
of electron ﬂow, acting as a power load. In this condition the inductor is said to be charging,
because there is an increasing amount of energy being stored in its magnetic ﬁeld. Note the
polarity of the voltage with regard to the direction of current:
