The main purpose of an antenna is to control a wave front at the boundary between two media: a source (or
receiver) and the medium of propagation. The source can be a Ô¨Åber, cable, waveguide, or other transmission
line.  The  medium  of  propagation  may  be  air,  vacuum,  water,  concrete,  metal,  or  tissue,  depending  on  the
application.  Antenna  aperture  design  is  used  in  acoustic,  optic,  and  electromagnetic  systems  for  imaging,
communications, radar, and spectroscopy applications.
