This simple circuit consists of a battery and a resistor connected directly together. We know
the voltage of the battery (10 volts) and the resistance of the resistor (5 Ω), but nothing else
about the circuit. If we describe this circuit to SPICE, it should be able to tell us (at the very
least), how much current we have in the circuit by using Ohm’s Law (I=E/R).
