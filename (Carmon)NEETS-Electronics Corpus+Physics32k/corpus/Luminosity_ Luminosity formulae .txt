The Stefan–Boltzmann equation applied to a black body gives the value for luminosity for a black body, an idealized object which is perfectly opaque and non-reflecting:




L
=
σ
A

T

4




{\displaystyle L=\sigma AT^{4}}
,
where A is the area, T is the temperature (in Kelvins) and σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, with a value of 5.670367(13)×10−8 W⋅m−2⋅K−4.
Imagine a point source of light of luminosity



L


{\displaystyle L}
that radiates equally in all directions. A hollow sphere centered on the point would have its entire interior surface illuminated. As the radius increases, the surface area will also increase, and the constant luminosity has more surface area to illuminate, leading to a decrease in observed brightness.




F
=


L
A




{\displaystyle F={\frac {L}{A}}}
,
where




A


{\displaystyle A}
is the area of the illuminated surface.




F


{\displaystyle F}
is the flux density of the illuminated surface.
The surface area of a sphere with radius r is



A
=
4
π

r

2




{\displaystyle A=4\pi r^{2}}
, so for stars and other point sources of light:




F
=


L

π

r

2








{\displaystyle F={\frac {L}{4\pi r^{2}}}\,}
,
where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance from the observer to the light source.
It has been shown that the luminosity of a star



L


{\displaystyle L}
(assuming the star is a black body, which is a good approximation) is also related to temperature



T


{\displaystyle T}
and radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
of the star by the equation:




L
=

T

{\displaystyle L=4\pi R^{2}\sigma T^{4}\,}
,
where
σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant 5.67×10−8 W·m−2·K−4.
Dividing by the luminosity of the Sun

and cancelling constants, we obtain the relationship:

{\displaystyle {\frac {L}{L_{\odot }}}={\left({\frac {R}{R_{\odot }}}\right)}^{2}{\left({\frac {T}{T_{\odot }}}\right)}^{4}}

where

{\displaystyle R_{\odot }}
and

For stars on the main sequence, luminosity is also related to mass:
