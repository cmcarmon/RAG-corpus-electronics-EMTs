Many circuits are designed to operate with a particular supply voltage. When the supply voltage 
changes, the operation of the circuit may be adversely affected. Consequently, some types of equipment 
must have power supplies that produce the same output voltage regardless of changes in the load 
resistance or changes in the ac line voltage. This constant output voltage may be achieved by adding a 
circuit called the VOLTAGE REGULATOR at the output of the filter. There are many different types of 
regulators in use today and to discuss all of them would be beyond the scope of this chapter.
