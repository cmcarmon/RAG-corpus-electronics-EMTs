from a long time constant (10 times the pulse duration), a short time constant (1/10 of the pulse duration), 
and a medium time constant (that time constant between the long and the short). To accurately plot values 
for the capacitor output voltage, we will use the Universal Time Constant Chart shown in figure 4-34.
