"The polynomial Pc maps each dynamical ray to another ray doubling the angle (which we measure in full turns, i.e. 0 = 1 = 2π rad = 360◦), and the dynamical rays of any polynomial “look like straight rays” near infinity. This allows us to study the Mandelbrot and Julia sets combinatorially, replacing the dynamical plane by the unit circle, rays by angles, and the quadratic polynomial by the doubling modulo one map."

On the dynamical plane one can find:
The Julia set
The Filled Julia set
The Fatou set
Orbits
The dynamical plane consists of:
Fatou set
Julia set
Here,



c



{\displaystyle c\,}
is a constant and



z



{\displaystyle z\,}
is a variable.
The two-dimensional dynamical plane can be treated as a Poincaré cross-section of three-dimensional space of continuous dynamical system.
Dynamical z-planes can be divided in two groups :





f

{\displaystyle f_{0}}
plane for

=

{\displaystyle c=0}
( see complex squaring map )





f

c




{\displaystyle f_{c}}
planes ( all other planes for

{\displaystyle c\neq 0}
)
