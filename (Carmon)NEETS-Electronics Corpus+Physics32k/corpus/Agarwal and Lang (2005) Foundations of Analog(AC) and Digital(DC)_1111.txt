to compute the incremental change in the signal about the operating point is
tantamount to replacing the actual curve with the tangent. Clearly, the tangent
approximation is valid only for points that are close to the operating point. The
higher-order term in Equation 8.6 that we neglected would add a quadratic
term to the model, thereby making the fit exact for our model.
