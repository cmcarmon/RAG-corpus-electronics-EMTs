Lastly, here is a picture of a digital multimeter. Note that the familiar meter movement has
been replaced by a blank, gray-colored display screen. When powered, numerical digits appear
in that screen area, depicting the amount of voltage, current, or resistance being measured.
This particular brand and model of digital meter has a rotary selector switch and four jacks
into which test leads can be plugged. Two leads – one red and one black – are shown plugged
into the meter.
