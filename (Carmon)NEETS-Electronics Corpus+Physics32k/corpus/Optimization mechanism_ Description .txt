The costs and benefits in the optimization models can generally be simplified into two attributes: the distance between the new node, and the existing one; and the distance of the existing node from the central node. Thus the goal function can be written in the following form:





C

i


=
m
i

n

j


[
δ
∗

d

i
j


+

h

j


]


{\displaystyle C_{i}=min_{j}[\delta *d_{ij}+h_{j}]}

where




C

i




{\displaystyle C_{i}}
stands for the minimal cost of attaching node 'i' to an existing node





d

i
j




{\displaystyle d_{ij}}
denotes the distance between node 'i' and 'j'





h

j




{\displaystyle h_{j}}
represents the distance of node 'j' from the central node




δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
is a parameter, that determines the weight of the individual distance compared to the distance to the central node, and thus it varies across different settings.
In a highway network setting - where cities are nodes and links are highways -




d

i
j




{\displaystyle d_{ij}}
would be the physical distance between cities, and




h

j




{\displaystyle h_{j}}
would be the distance from the capital (or from the central city of the region). The value of



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
determines the type of the network built by the optimization mechanism.
