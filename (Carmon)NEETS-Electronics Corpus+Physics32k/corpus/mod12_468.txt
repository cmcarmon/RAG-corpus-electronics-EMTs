The gated-beam detector employs a specially designed gated-beam tube. The elements of this tube
are shown in figure 3-17. The focus electrode forms a shield around the tube cathode except for a narrow
slot through which the electron beam flows. The beam of electrons flows toward the limiter grid which
acts like a gate. When the gate is open, the electron beam flows through to the next grid. When closed, the
gate completely stops the beam.
