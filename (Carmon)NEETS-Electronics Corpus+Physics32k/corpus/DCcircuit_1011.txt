Anyone who’s studied geometry should be familiar with the concept of a theorem: a relatively
simple rule used to solve a problem, derived from a more intensive analysis using fundamental
rules of mathematics. At least hypothetically, any problem in math can be solved just by using
the simple rules of arithmetic (in fact, this is how modern digital computers carry out the most
complex mathematical calculations: by repeating many cycles of additions and subtractions!),
but human beings aren’t as consistent or as fast as a digital computer. We need “shortcut”
methods in order to avoid procedural errors.
