For L > > l, sinq » q,  which implies that the ﬁrst zero is at q  = l/L. The location of the ﬁrst zero is known
as the Rayleigh resolution criteria. That is, two plane waves separated by at least l/L radians can be discriminated.
For imaging applications, this corresponds roughly to the smallest detectable feature size. As shown in Fig. 38.10,
the ﬁrst zero occurs at approximately l/L = 0.25 radians (the Rayleigh resolution). Note that there is no side
lobe  suppression  until  d  £  l,  when  the  location  of  the  zeros  becomes  ﬁxed.  Having  more  than  eight  array
elements (separation of less than a quarter wavelength) only moderately reduces the height of the maximum
side lobe.
