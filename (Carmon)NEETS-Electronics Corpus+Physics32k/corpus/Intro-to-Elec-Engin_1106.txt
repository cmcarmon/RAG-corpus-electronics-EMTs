The torque that exists at any mechanical speed other than synchronous speed is known as an
asynchronous torque. The induction machine is also known as an asynchronous machine, since no
torque is produced at synchronous speed and the machine runs at a speed other than synchronous
speed. In fact, as a motor, the machine runs only at a speed that is less than synchronous speed
with positive slip. The factors inﬂuencing the general shape of the torque-speed characteristic
(shown in Figure 13.1.6) can be appreciated in terms of the torque equation, Equation (13.1.3).
Noting that the resultant air-gap ﬂux φ is nearly constant when the stator-applied voltage and
frequency are constant, as seen by Equation (13.1.4), and that the rotor mmf Fr is proportional to
the rotor current ir, the torque may be expressed as
