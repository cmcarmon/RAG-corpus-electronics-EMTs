Antonov An-24RV departed from Komsomolsk-on-Amur at 14:56 local time, after a four-hour delay due to weather conditions. The crew consisted of first pilot Alexander Mirgorodsky, co-pilot Valery Shevelev, navigating officer Fedosy Kryzhanovsky, flight engineer Nikolai Dimitriyev and air hostess Galina Borisova. Among the passengers was one child. Larisa Savitskaya and her husband Vladimir were returning from their honeymoon.
The flight dispatcher was informed that the local airspace would be traversed by military aircraft at an altitudes of 4,200–4,500 metres (13,800–14,800 ft). On the same day, at 16:00 and 16:01 local time two Tupolev Tu-16K left Zavitinsk air base for weather reconnaissance. At 16:21 local time one of them (serial number 6203106) collided with the Aeroflot An-24RV, 70 km east of Zavitinsk air base. The collision occurred in good lighting conditions, with a visibility of over 10 km. Savitskaya was sound asleep at that moment. The Tu-16K razed off the An-24RV's roof and severed both wings. The temperature inside An-24RV's cabin dropped from 25 °C (77 °F) to −30 °C (−22 °F). Both aircraft disintegrated and fell on taiga terrain. The fragments of Antonov An-24RV were scattered in a south-western direction, 1020 m from the collision point, on a 2500х900 m area. The Tu-16K exploded after the ground impact, its fragments were scattered approximately 2000 m from the collision point.
Savitskaya was conscious during the fall, which lasted eight minutes. She survived partly because the 4х3 m aircraft fragment she was in started to glide and landed on a soft, swampy glade. Savitskaya also pushed against the seat with her hands and feet, "perhaps hoping to absorb the blow" in her own words. The impact with the ground, however, knocked her temporarily unconscious. She sustained a concussion, a broken arm and rib and some spinal injuries.
