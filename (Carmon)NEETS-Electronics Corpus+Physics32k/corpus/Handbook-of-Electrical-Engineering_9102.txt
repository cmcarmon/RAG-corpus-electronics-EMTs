From a purely electrical point of view, the solution seems to be simple: both card and terminal are equipped
with  coupling  loops  (electrical  coils)  allowing  transmission  of  energy  similar  to  a  coreless  transformer
(Fig. 89.40). The cardâ€™s loop is embedded in a plastic body to avoid getting destroyed or touched.
