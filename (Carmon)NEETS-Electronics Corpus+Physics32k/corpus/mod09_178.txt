A high-pass filter circuit passes all currents having a frequency higher than a specified frequency, 
while opposing all currents having a frequency lower than its specified frequency. This is illustrated in 
figure 1-17. A capacitor that is used in series with the source of both high and low frequencies, as shown 
in view (A) of figure 1-18, will respond differently to high-frequency, low-frequency, and direct currents. 
It will offer little opposition to the passage of high-frequency currents, great opposition to the passage of 
low-frequency currents, and completely block direct currents. The value of the capacitor must be chosen 
so that it allows the passage of all currents having frequencies above the desired value, and opposes those 
having frequencies below the desired value. Then, in order to shunt the undesired low-frequency currents 
back to the source, an inductor is used, as shown in view (B). This inductor must have a value that will 
allow it to pass currents having frequencies below the frequency cutoff point, and reject currents having 
frequencies above the frequency cutoff point, thus forcing them to pass through the capacitor. By 
combining inductance and capacitance, as shown in view (C), you obtain the simplest type of high-pass 
filter. At point P most of the high-frequency energy is passed on to the load by the capacitor, and most of 
the low-frequency energy is shunted back to the source through the inductor.
