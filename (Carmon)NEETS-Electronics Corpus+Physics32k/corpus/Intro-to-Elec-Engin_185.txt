Certain network conﬁgurations cannot be reduced or simpliﬁed by series–parallel combinations
alone. In some such cases wye–delta (Y–) transformation can be used to replace three resistors
in wye conﬁguration by three resistors in delta conﬁguration, or vice versa, so that the networks
are equivalent in so far as the terminals (A, B, C) are concerned, as shown in Figure 2.4.1.
