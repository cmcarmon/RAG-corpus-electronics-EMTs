Many common transistors are extremely heat sensitive. Excess heat will cause the semiconductor to
either fail or give intermittent operation. You have probably experienced intermittent equipment problems
and know them to be both time consuming and frustrating. You know, for example, that if a problem is in
fact caused by heat, simply opening the equipment during the course of troubleshooting may cause the
problem to disappear. You can generally isolate the problem to the faulty printed-circuit board (pcb) by
observing the fault indications. However, to further isolate the problem to a faulty component, sometimes
you must apply a minimal amount of heat to the suspect pcb by carefully using a low wattage, heat shrink
gun; an incandescent drop light; or a similar heating device. Be careful not to overheat the pcb. Once the
fault indication reappears, you can isolate the faulty component by spraying those components suspected
as being bad with a nonconductive circuit coolant, such as Freon. If the alternate heating and cooling of a
component causes it to operate intermittently, you should replace it.
