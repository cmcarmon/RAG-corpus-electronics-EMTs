If we want electrons to ﬂow in a certain direction to a certain place, we must provide the
proper path for them to move, just as a plumber must install piping to get water to ﬂow where
he or she wants it to ﬂow. To facilitate this, wires are made of highly conductive metals such
as copper or aluminum in a wide variety of sizes.
