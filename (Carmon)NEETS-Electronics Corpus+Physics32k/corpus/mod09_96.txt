In view (B), moving the switch to the right completes the circuit from the capacitor to the inductor 
and places the inductor in series with the capacitor. This furnishes a path for the excess electrons on the 
upper plate of the capacitor to flow to the lower plate, and thus starts neutralizing the capacitor charge. As 
these electrons flow through the coil, a magnetic field is built up around the coil. The energy which was 
first stored by the electrostatic field of the capacitor is now stored in the electromagnetic field of the 
inductor.
