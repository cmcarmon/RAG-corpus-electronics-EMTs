A multimeter is an inexpensive handheld testing device that can measure 
voltage, current, and resistance. Some can also test diodes, capacitors, and 
transistors. With this one handy tool, you can verify proper voltages, test 
whether you have a short circuit, determine whether thereâ€™s a break in a wire 
or connection, and much more. Make friends with your multimeter, because 
it can help you make sure your circuits work properly and is an invaluable 
tool for scouting out circuit problems.
