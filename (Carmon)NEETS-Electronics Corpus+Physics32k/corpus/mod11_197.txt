Because of the desirable characteristics of wide bandwidth, high efficiency, and the ability to handle 
large amounts of power, the cfa is used in many applications in microwave electronic systems. This high 
efficiency has made the cfa useful for space-telemetry applications, and the high power and stability have 
made it useful in high-energy, linear atomic accelerators. When used as the intermediate or final stage in 
high-power radar systems, all of the advantages of the cfa are used.
