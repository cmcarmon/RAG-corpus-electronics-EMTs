where p(t) is the basic pulse shape and is assumed to be of rectangular form. This type of modulation is usually
used with binary phase-shift-keyed (BPSK) information signals, which have the complex form d(t ) exp{j(2p fct
+ qc)}, where d(t ) is a binary-valued data waveform of rate 1/Tb bit/s and fc and qc are the frequency and phase
of the data-modulated carrier, respectively. As such, a DS/BPSK signal is formed by multiplying the BPSK signal
by c(t) (see Fig. 70.14), resulting in the real transmitted signal
