Delp et al. (2001) represented a shot using a tree structure
called a shot tree. This tree is formed by an agglomerative
clustering technique performed on individual frames in a shot.
Starting at the lowest level with each frame representing a
cluster, the algorithm iteratively combines the two most simi-
lar frames at a particular level into one cluster at the next
higher level. The process continues until a single cluster repre-
sented by one frame for the whole shot is obtained. This
approach uniÔ¨Åes the problem of scene content representation
for both browsing and similarity matching. For browsing, only
the root node of the tree (keyframe) is used, whereas for
similarity matching, two or three levels of tree can be used,
employing standard tree matching algorithms.
