The current loop scale of 4-20 milliamps has not always been the standard for current in-
struments: for a while there was also a 10-50 milliamp standard, but that standard has since
been obsoleted. One reason for the eventual supremacy of the 4-20 milliamp loop was safety:
with lower circuit voltages and lower current levels than in 10-50 mA system designs, there
was less chance for personal shock injury and/or the generation of sparks capable of igniting
ï¬‚ammable atmospheres in certain industrial environments.
