###The  precision  peak  detector  circuit  can  be  analyzed  by  considering  two 
configurations  of  this  circuit  separately:  (1)  when  the  diode  is  forward  biased,  and  (2) 
when  the  diode  is  reversed  biased.  This  technique  enables  the  application  of  linear 
analysis while avoiding the inherent nonlinearity of the diode.
