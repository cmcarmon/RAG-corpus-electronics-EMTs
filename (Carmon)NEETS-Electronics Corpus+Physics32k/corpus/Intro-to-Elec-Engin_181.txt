(a) Loop-Current Method: The voltage-controlled current source and its parallel resistance
are converted into a voltage-controlled voltage source and series resistance. When you
are source transforming dependent sources, note that the identity of the control variable
(i.e., the location in the circuit) must be retained. The converted circuit is shown in Figure
E2.2.5(b) with the chosen loop currents I1 and I2.
