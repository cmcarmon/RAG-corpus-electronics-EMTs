There are four main types of solid state digitally controlled phase shifters: switched line, reﬂection, loaded
line, and low-pass/high-pass, as shown in Fig. 43.10(b). The switched-line and low-pass/high-pass conﬁgura-
tions,  which  are  most  suitable  for  broadband  applications  and  compact  size,  are  not  suitable  for  analog
operation. Reﬂection and loaded-line phase shifters are inherently narrowband; however, the loaded-line small
bit phase shifters, 22.5 degrees or less, can be designed to have up to an octave bandwidth. Phase shifters using
the vector-modulator concept have also been developed in monolithic form.
