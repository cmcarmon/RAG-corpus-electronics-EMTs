Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage. If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data. For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature.
Some types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time. This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts.
