When discussing how to optimize the system, it can be beneficial to discuss what a leverage point is.
The leverage point in the system is a place where structural changes can lead to significant and lasting improvements to the system. There are two kinds of leverage points:
Low leverage point – These points are usually the places in the system where the stress is greatest. However, solving problems at these points usually doesn’t lead to a lasting improvement
High leverage point – These points are often hidden in the system, but even smaller changes in these components can lead to significant and lasting improvements in the system as a whole
When dealing with this archetype, several generic strategies can be considered in order to solve the problem the archetype presents.
