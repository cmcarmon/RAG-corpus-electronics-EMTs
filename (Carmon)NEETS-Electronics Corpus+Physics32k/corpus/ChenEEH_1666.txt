spatial data structure to preserve the structural information in
the color image. Based on a perceptually uniform color space
CIELab*, each image is quantized into k bins to represent k
different color groups. A color layout corresponding to pixels
of each color in the whole image is formed for each bin and is
represented by the corresponding encoded quadtree. This en-
coded quadtree-based representation not only keeps the spatial
information intact but also results in a system that is highly
scalable in terms of query search time.
