Self-clinching cable straps are adjustable, lightweight, flat nylon straps. They have molded ribs or 
serrations on the inside surface to grip the wire. They may be used instead of individual cord ties for 
securing wire groups or bundles quickly. The straps are of two types: a plain cable strap and one that has 
a flat surface for identifying the cables.
