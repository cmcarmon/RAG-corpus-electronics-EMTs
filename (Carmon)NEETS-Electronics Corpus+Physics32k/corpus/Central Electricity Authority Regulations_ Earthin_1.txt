Earthing in an underground mine shall be carried out by connection to an earthing system at the surface of the mine as per rule 99.
As per rule 100, protective equipment is to be placed in the mines for automatic disconnection of supply when there is earth fault exceeding 750 milliampere in 250 V to 1000 Volt installations. For open cast mine the limit is 50 ampere in installations of voltage exceeding 1100 V and up to 11 kV. The earth leakage current is to be restricted by placing suitable neutral grounding resistance (NGR) in all the distribution transformers.
