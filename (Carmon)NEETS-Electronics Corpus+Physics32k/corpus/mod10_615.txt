Although either horizontally or vertically polarized antennas can be used for high frequencies, 
horizontally polarized antennas have certain advantages and are therefore preferred. One advantage is that 
vertically polarized interference signals, such as those produced by automobile ignition systems and 
electrical appliances, are minimized by horizontal polarization. Also, less absorption of radiated energy 
by buildings or wiring occurs when these antennas are used. Another advantage is that support structures 
for these antennas are of more convenient size than those for vertically polarized antennas.
