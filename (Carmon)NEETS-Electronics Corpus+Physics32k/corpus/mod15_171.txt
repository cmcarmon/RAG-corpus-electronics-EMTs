The output of each transmitter is passed through standard synchro connections to a receiver. One 
receiver receives the coarse signal and the other one receives the fine signal. The two receivers may or 
may not be connected by a network of gears similar to the network between the two transmitters. In some 
dual-speed applications, a double receiver is used instead of two individual receivers.
