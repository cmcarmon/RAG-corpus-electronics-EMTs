Speed Evaluation Methods.  Various methods may be used to evaluate the speed value, all of which involve
some combination of pulse counting and time measurement. The constant elapsed time (CET) method provides
a good compromise between measurement accuracy and response time. The CET method records the number
of encoder pulses observed during a Ô¨Åxed time interval. The rotational speed, n, is then given by
