provide an output that is proportional to the peak rf pulses. The filter offers a low impedance to rf and a
relatively high impedance to af. (Filters were discussed in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-
Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) This action causes C2 to develop the waveform in view (D).
This varying af voltage is applied to the headset which then reproduces the original modulating
frequency. This circuit is called a series-diode detector (sometimes referred to as a VOLTAGE-DIODE
DETECTOR) because the semiconductor diode is in series with both the input voltage and the load
impedance. Voltages in the circuit cause an output voltage to develop across the load impedance that is
proportional to the input voltage peaks of the modulation envelope.
