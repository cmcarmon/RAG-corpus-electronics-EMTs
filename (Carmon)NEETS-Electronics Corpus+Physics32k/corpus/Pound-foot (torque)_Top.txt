A pound-foot (lbf·ft or lb·ft) is a unit of torque (a pseudovector). One pound-foot is the torque created by one pound force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point. Conversely one pound-foot is the moment about an axis that applies one pound-force at a radius of one foot.
One pound-foot is approximately 1.355818 newton meters.
The name "pound-foot", intended to minimize confusion with the foot-pound as a unit of work, was apparently first proposed by British physicist Arthur Mason Worthington. However, the torque unit is often still referred to as the foot-pound (ft·lbf).
