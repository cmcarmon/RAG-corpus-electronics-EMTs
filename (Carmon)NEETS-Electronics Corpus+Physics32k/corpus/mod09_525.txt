Now let's look at what takes place when reverse bias is aided, as shown in figure 4-5, view (A). The 
diode is negatively biased with -5 volts from the battery. In view (B), compare the output to the input 
signal applied. From T0 to T1 the diode is reverse biased and limiting takes place. The output is at -5 
volts (battery voltage) during this period. As the negative alternation increases toward -10 volts (T1), the 
cathode of the diode becomes more negative than the anode and is forward biased. From T1 to T2 the 
input signal is passed to the output. The diode remains forward biased until the negative alternation has 
decreased to âˆ’5 volts at T2. At T2 the cathode of the diode becomes more positive than the anode, and the 
diode is again reverse biased and remains so until T3.
