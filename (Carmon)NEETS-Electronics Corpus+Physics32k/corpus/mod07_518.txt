Study figure 4-36, view A, in order to understand what happens when the input voltage exceeds 20 
volts. Notice the input and output voltages of 20.1 and 14.4 volts, respectively. The 14.4 output voltage is 
a momentary deviation, or variation, from the required regulated output voltage of 14.3 and is the result of 
a rise in the input voltage to 20.1 volts. Since the base voltage of Q1 is held at 15 volts by CR1, the
