Shot Noise
In a conductor under an external emf, there is an average ﬂow of electrons, holes, photons, etc. In addition to
this induced net ﬂow and thermal noise, there is another effect. The potential differs across the boundaries of
metallic  grains  and  particles  of  impurities,  and  when  the  kinetic  energy  of  electrons  exceeds  this  potential,
electrons jump across the barrier. This summed random ﬂow is known as shot noise [see Gardner, 1990, p. 239;
Ott, 1988, p. 208]. The shot effect was analyzed by Schottky in 1918 as Ish = (2qIdc B)1/2, where q = 1.6 3 10–19
coulombs per electron, Idc = average dc current in amperes, and B = noise bandwidth (Hz).
Partition Noise
Partition noise is caused by a parting of the ﬂow of electrons to different electrodes into streams of randomly
varying density. Suppose that electrons from some source S ﬂow to destination electrodes A and B. Let n(A)
and n(B) be the average numbers of electrons per second that go to nodes A and B respectively, so that n(S) =
n(A) + n(B) is the average total number of electrons emitted per second. It is a success when an electron goes
to A, and the probability of success on a single trial is p, where
