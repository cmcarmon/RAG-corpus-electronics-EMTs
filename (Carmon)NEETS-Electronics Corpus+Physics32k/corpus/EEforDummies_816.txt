If the voltage reading is positive, your positive (usually red) multimeter 
lead is attached to the positive conductor of the AC adapter. If the volt-
age reading is negative, your negative (usually black) multimeter lead is 
attached to the positive conductor of the AC adapter. Label the positive 
conductor with a marker or by attaching a label.
Note that the magnitude of the voltage reading you get is likely signifi-
cantly higher than the nominal voltage specified on the label or data 
sheet of the AC adapter. This discrepancy is normal and due to the 
fact that you are using an unregulated power supply and measuring 
the adapter’s output voltage under no‐load conditions. Unregulated 
power supplies generate voltages that vary depending on the current 
drawn by the load, that is, the device receiving power. After you con-
nect the adapter’s output leads to a circuit, the output voltage will 
come down. I measured 10.5 V on an AC adapter that was labeled 
7.5 VDC (volts DC).
