The Maxwell equations in differential form are valid at all times for every point in space. First we shall investigate

solutions  to  the  Maxwell  equations  in  regions  void  of  source,  namely,  in  regions  where 
course, does not mean that there is no source anywhere in all space. Sources must exist outside the regions of
interest in order to produce ﬁelds in these regions. From the source-free Maxwell equations, a wave equation
