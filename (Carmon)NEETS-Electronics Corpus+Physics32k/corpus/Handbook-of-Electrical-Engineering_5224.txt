The most frequently used 
through pipelines. In the former case the gas is liqueÔ¨Åed. Coal is transported by rail or ships if the plant is near
a river or the sea. The power plant requires several days of fuel reserve. Oil and gas are stored in large metal
tanks, and coal is kept in open yards. The temperature of the coal layer must be monitored to avoid self-ignition.
Coal is pulverized in large mills, and the powder
is mixed with air and transported by air pressure, through pipes, to the burners. The coal transport from the
yard to the mills requires automated transporter belts, hoppers, and sometimes manually operated bulldozers.
