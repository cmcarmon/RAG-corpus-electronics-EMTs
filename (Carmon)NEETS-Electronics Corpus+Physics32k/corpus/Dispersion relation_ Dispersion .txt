Dispersion occurs when pure plane waves of different wavelengths have different propagation velocities, so that a wave packet of mixed wavelengths tends to spread out in space. The speed of a plane wave, v, is a function of the wave's wavelength



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
:




v
=
v
(
λ
)
.



{\displaystyle v=v(\lambda ).\,}

The wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency, f, are related by the identity




v
(
λ
)
=
λ

f
(
λ
)
.



{\displaystyle v(\lambda )=\lambda \ f(\lambda ).\,}

The function



f
(
λ
)


{\displaystyle f(\lambda )}
expresses the dispersion relation of the given medium. Dispersion relations are more commonly expressed in terms of the angular frequency

f


{\displaystyle \omega =2\pi f}
and wavenumber

/

λ


{\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }
. Rewriting the relation above in these variables gives




ω
(
k
)
=
v
(
k
)

k
.



{\displaystyle \omega (k)=v(k)\ k.\,}

where we now view f as a function of k. The use of ω(k) to describe the dispersion relation has become standard because both the phase velocity ω/k and the group velocity dω/dk have convenient representations via this function.
The plane waves being considered can be described by

where
A is the amplitude of the wave,
A0 = A(0,0),
x is a position along the wave's direction of travel, and
t is the time at which the wave is described.
