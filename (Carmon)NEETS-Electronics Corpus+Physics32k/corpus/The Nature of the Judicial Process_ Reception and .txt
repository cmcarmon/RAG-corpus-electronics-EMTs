The Nature of the Judicial Process established Cardozo “as one of the leading jurists of his time” and “has become a classic of legal education." Its continuing appeal is due, in part, to its self-effacing tone, its lapidary prose, and its attempt to strike a happy medium between legal formalism and radical realist theories that wholly reject traditional views of law, legal reasoning, judicial restraint, and the rule of law.
The great success of Cardozo’s The Nature of the Judicial Process created demand for further reflections on the law. In two later works, The Growth of Law (1924) and The Paradoxes of Legal Science (1927), Cardozo refined, deepened, and to some extent modified the views of law laid out in The Nature of the Judicial Process.
