When a transmitter is suspected of being defective, a synchro tester is usually substituted in its place 
to simulate its actions. When the tester is used in this manner, a braking arrangement on the tester applies 
the necessary friction to hold its shaft in different positions so you can determine whether the transmitter 
is good or bad. When using the tester as a transmitter, it is usually a good idea to use only one receiver so 
as not to overload the tester. If the tester is connected in place of a TR or used to check the output of a 
transmitter, the brake is released, allowing the rotor to turn and indicate the transmitter's position. By 
observing the tester's response to the transmitted signal, you can determine if the TR is defective or if the 
transmitter's output is incorrect.
