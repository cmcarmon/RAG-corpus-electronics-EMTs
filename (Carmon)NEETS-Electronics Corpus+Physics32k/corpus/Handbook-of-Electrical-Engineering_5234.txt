-type turbine. Steam enters through nozzles and ﬂows
through the ﬁrst set of moving rotor blades. The following stationary blades change the direction of the ﬂow
and  direct  the  steam  into  the  next  set  of  moving  blades.  The  nozzles  increase  the  steam  speed  and  reduce
pressure, as shown in the ﬁgure. The impact of the high-speed steam, generated by the change of direction and
speed in the moving blades, drives the turbine.
