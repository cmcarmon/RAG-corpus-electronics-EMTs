The type of spark gap used as a tr tube may vary. It may be one that is simply formed by two
electrodes placed across the transmission line; or it may be one enclosed in an evacuated glass envelope
with special features to improve operation. The requirements of the spark gap are (1) high impedance
prior to the arc and (2) very low impedance during arc time. At the end of the transmitted pulse the arc
