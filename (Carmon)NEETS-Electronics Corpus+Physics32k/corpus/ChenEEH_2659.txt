Among the four kinds of testing functions described, the
point-matching and Galerkin’s formulations are widely used in
the moment method. It was a common belief that Galerkin’s
formulation yields best accuracy; however, recent research
indicates that the solution accuracy mainly depends on the
basis functions and much less on the choice of testing func-
tions (Peterson et al., 1997).
