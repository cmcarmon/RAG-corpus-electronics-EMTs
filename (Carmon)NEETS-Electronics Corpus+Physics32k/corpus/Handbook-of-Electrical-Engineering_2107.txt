Classiﬁcation
The third function of sonar signal processing is classiﬁcation. This function determines the type of object that
has radiated or reﬂected acoustic energy. For example, was the sonar signal return from a school of ﬁsh or a
reﬂection from the ocean bottom? The action one takes is highly dependent upon this important function. The
amount of radiated or reﬂected signal power relative to the background noise (that is, SNR) necessary to achieve
good classiﬁcation may be higher than for detection. Also, the type of signal processing required for classiﬁcation
may be different than the type of processing for detection. Processing methods that are developed on the basis
of detection might not have the requisite SNR to adequately perform the classiﬁcation function. Classiﬁers are,
in  general,  divided  into  feature  (or  clue)  extractors  followed  by  a  classiﬁer  decision  box. A  key  to  successful
classiﬁcation is feature extraction. Performance of classiﬁers is plotted as in ROC detection curves as probability
of deciding on class A, given A was actually present, or P(A/A), versus the probability of deciding on class B,
given that A was present, i.e., P(B/A), for two different classes of objects, A and B. Of course, for the same class
of objects, one could also plot P(B/B) versus P(A/B).
