An  expository  paper  on  the  application  of  the  state-variables  technique  to  network  analysis  was  originally
written  by  E.  S.  Kuh  and  R.  A.  Rohrer  (“State-variables  approach  to  network  analysis,”  Proc.  IEEE,  vol.  53,
pp. 672–686, July 1965). A computer-aided network analysis based on state-variables approach is extensively
discussed in the book by Wai-Kai Chen, Linear Networks and Systems: Algorithms and Computer-Aided Imple-
mentations  (World  Scientiﬁc  Publishing  Co.,  Singapore,  1990).  The  use  of  state  variables  in  the  analysis  of
electronics circuits and nonlinear networks is treated in the book by L. O. Chua and P. M. Lin, Computer-Aided
Analysis of Electronics Circuits: Algorithms & Computational Techniques (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J.,
1975). The application of state-variables technique to active network analysis is contained in the book by Wai-
Kai Chen, Active Network Analysis (World Scientiﬁc Publishing Co., Singapore, 1991).
