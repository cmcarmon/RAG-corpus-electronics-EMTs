Hydrothermal Source.
This is the most developed source. Power plants, up to a capacity of 2000 MW, are
in operation worldwide. Heat from the magma is conducted upward by the rocks. The groundwater drifts down
through the cracks and ﬁssures to form reservoirs when water-impermeable solid rock bed is present. The water
in this reservoir is heated by the heat from the magma. Depending on the distance from the magma and rock
conﬁguration, steam, hot pressurized water, or the mixture of the two are generated. Signs of these underwater
reservoirs  include  hot  springs  and  geysers.  The  reservoir  is  tapped  by  a  well,  which  brings  the  steam-water
mixture to the surface to produce energy. The geothermal power plant concept is illustrated in Fig. 59.10.
