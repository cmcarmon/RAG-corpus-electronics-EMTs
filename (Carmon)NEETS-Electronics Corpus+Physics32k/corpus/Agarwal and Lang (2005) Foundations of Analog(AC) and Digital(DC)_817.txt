but we ignore this resistance in the S model. Section 6.6 will discuss the switch-
resistor model (or the SR model), which attempts to account for this resistance.
In the OFF state, an open circuit exists between the drain and the source. As
illustrated in Figure 6.10, an open circuit exists between the gate and the source,
and between the gate and the drain at all times. Thus, iG = 0 always.
