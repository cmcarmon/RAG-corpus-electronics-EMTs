Once a diode starts conducting, a voltage drop 
 occurs. This voltage drop is equal to the barrier 
voltage and is referred to as the forward voltage  
drop (EF). The voltage drop is 0.3 V for a germa-
nium  diode  and  0.7  V  for  a  silicon  diode.  The 
amount of forward current (IF) is a function of the 
external voltage (E), the forward voltage drop (EF), 
and the external resistance (R). The relationship can 
be shown using Ohmâ€™s law:
