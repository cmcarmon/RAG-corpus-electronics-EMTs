This chapter describes the historical approach to gain sched-
uling, discussing options for developing the scheduling law
and noting some of the gain-scheduling lessons that have
received theoretical justiﬁcation in recent years. More recent
gain scheduling results are presented for the class of systems
modeled as linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. For LPV
systems, some of the difﬁculties associated with gain schedul-
ing designs are alleviated. Speciﬁcally, recent theoretical devel-
opments have made it possible to simultaneously synthesize
the controller and scheduling law to guarantee stability and
performance over a known set of parameter variations.
