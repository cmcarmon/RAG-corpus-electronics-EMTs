The  evolving  thin-ﬁlm  and  concentrator  technologies  have  additional  complexities  and,  likely,  as  yet
unknown  problems.  These  advanced  technologies  are  much  different  from  their  ﬂat-plate  silicon  cousins.
Consider the thin-ﬁlm solar cells. Because the surface-to-volume ratios in these solar cell types are extremely
high compared with bulk counterparts, materials and environmental interactions are not only enhanced, but
affect relatively larger portions of the structures. These structures are also more complex, beyond the numerous
interfaces that are inherent to the device itself. The cross sections for a-Si:H integrated module designs, shown
in Fig. 60.14, illustrate areas of concern for shunting (bridges), contact openings, electromigration, interdiffu-
sion, delamination, and microdefects that affect macroscale electrical behavior. Moreover, concentrators present
module designs and complexities that have little relationship to their “one-sun” relatives.
