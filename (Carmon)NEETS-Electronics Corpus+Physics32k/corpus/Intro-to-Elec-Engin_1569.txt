*15.2.38 A radar system uses pulses of duration D to modu-
late the amplitude of a radio carrier wave. The sys-
tem can distinguish between targets spaced apart
by a distance of d ≥ cD, where c is the velocity
of light. In view of 1/100 ≤ B/fc ≤ 1/10, ﬁnd
the minimum practical value of fc so that dmin =
30 m.
