Figure 83.24 shows the important reactions that occur in a gas discharge for the monochrome gas mixture
of neon and argon. The reactions in the gas volume include ionization (I), excitation (E), metastable generation
(M), and Penning ionization (P). The three surface reactions that occur at the cathode cause ejection of electrons
from the cathode by a bombarding neon ion, a neon metastable atom or by a high energy photon. The most
important volume reaction is ionization (I), which can cause the generation of an avalanche in the gas volume
as shown in Fig. 83.24. This avalanche is started by an electron near the cathode and as it grows toward the
anode,  it  generates  a  large  number  of  electron-ion  pairs.  The  number  of  electron-ion  pairs  increases  with
increasing applied voltage across the gas. Ions, photons, or metastable atoms that are transported to the cathode
can then eject electrons with a cathode surface-dependent probability and these ejected electrons will initiate
further avalanches. These mechanisms act as a positive feedback system that becomes unstable when the loop
gain is greater than 1. The onset of the unstable condition is deﬁned as the gas ﬁring voltage. Above this ﬁring
voltage the discharge current will continue to grow without bounds if the initial avalanche is primed with at
least a single electron.
