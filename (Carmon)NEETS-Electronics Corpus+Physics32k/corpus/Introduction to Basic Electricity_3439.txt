When all factors are considered, the advantages 
outweigh the disadvantages. Integrated circuits  reduce 
the size, weight, and cost of electronic equipment 
while increasing its reliability. As integrated circuits 
become more sophisticated, they become capable of 
performing a wider range of tasks.
