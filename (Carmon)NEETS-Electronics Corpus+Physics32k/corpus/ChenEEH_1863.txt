. Active session management: Once the session descrip-
tion is delivered, SIP conveys the response (accept or
reject) to the session initiation point (the caller). If
the response is ‘‘accept,’’ the session becomes active. If
the session involves multimedia, media streams can now
be exchanged between the two users. RTP and RTCP are
some common protocols for transporting real-time data.
SIP can also be used to change the parameters of an active
session, such as removing some video media stream or
reducing the quality of the audio stream.
