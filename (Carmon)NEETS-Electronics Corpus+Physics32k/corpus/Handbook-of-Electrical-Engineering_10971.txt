The current reversal of a biphasic stimulus can reverse a developing action potential that was elicited by the
initial phase. As a result, a biphasic pulse may have a higher threshold than a monophasic pulse as suggested
by the biphasic thresholds in Fig. 113.6. The degree of biphasic threshold elevation is magniÔ¨Åed as the stimulus
duration is reduced.
