This ﬁlter is noninverting and unity gain, i.e., H must be one, and the scaling factors shown in Eq. (29.21)
should  be  used  to  obtain  reasonable  element  values.  This  is  a  very  popular  ﬁlter  for  realizing  second-order
functions because it uses a minimum number of components and since the operation ampliﬁer is in the unity
gain conﬁguration it has very good bandwidth.
