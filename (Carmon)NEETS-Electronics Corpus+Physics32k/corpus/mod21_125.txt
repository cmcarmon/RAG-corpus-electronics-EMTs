If the average receiving tube is not overdriven or operated continuously at maximum rating, it can
have a life of at least 2,000 hours before the filament opens. Because of the expansion and contraction of
tube elements during the process of heating and cooling, electrodes may lean or sag, which causes
excessive noise or microphonics to develop. Other electron-tube defects are cathode-to-heater leakage and
nonuniform electron emission of the cathode. These common tube defects contribute to about 50% of all
electronic equipment failures. For this reason you should immediately eliminate any tube known to be
faulty. However, avoid blind or random replacement of good tubes with fresh spares. The most common
cause of tube failure is open filaments. Evidence of a tube defect is often obvious when the filament is
open in glass-envelope tubes. You will also notice the brighter-than-normal cherry-red glow of the plate
when the plate current is excessive. Also, when the tube becomes gassy or when arcing occurs between
electrodes, you will probably have visual indication. Metal-encased tubes can be felt for warmth to
determine if the heater is operating. You can tap a tube while it is operating in a circuit to reveal an aural
indication of loose elements within the tube or microphonics, which are produced by loose elements.
