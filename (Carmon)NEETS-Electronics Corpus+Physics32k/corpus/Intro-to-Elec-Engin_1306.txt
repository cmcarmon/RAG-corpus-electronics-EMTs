Filtering, Distortion, and Equalization
Frequency response and ﬁlters were discussed in Section 3.4. Any undesired waveform alteration
produced by a frequency-selective network is known as linear distortion. It is so designated to
distinguish it from the distortion caused by nonlinear elements. Let us now investigate ﬁltering
and linear distortion from the point of view of spectral analysis.
