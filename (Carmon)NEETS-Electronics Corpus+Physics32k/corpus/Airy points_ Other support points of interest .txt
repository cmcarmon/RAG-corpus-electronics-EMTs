Other sets of support points, even closer than the Bessel points, which may be wanted in some applications are:
The points for minimum sag, 0.5536 times the length. Minimum sag occurs when the centre of the rod sags the same amount as the end points, which is not quite the same thing as minimum horizontal motion of the ends.
The nodes of free vibration, 0.5516 times the length.
The points for zero central sag (any closer and the beam rises between the support points): 0.5228 times the length.
