where T is deﬁned to be the signal’s period: the smallest positive number such that s (t) = s (t + T ).
(a) What is the period of s (t) = A sin (2πf0t + φ)?
(b) What is the rms value of this signal? How is it related to the peak value?
(c) What is the period and rms value of the depicted (Figure 1.5) square wave, generically denoted by
