For the theoretical treatment of the BJT, the basic semicon-
ductor equations can be employed (cf., pn-diode). Once again,
a regional approach is useful for arriving at reasonably simple
analytical equations that describe the electrical behavior.
Results of classical transistor theory are presented Ô¨Årst to
provide a feeling for the basic analytical formulations of vari-
ous characteristics (Lindmayer and Wrigley, 1965; Pritchard,
1967; Philips, 1962).
