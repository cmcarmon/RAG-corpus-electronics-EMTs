From  the  standpoint  of  television  receiver  manufacturing  simplicity  and  low  cost,  packaging  of  the  display
device as a single component is attractive. The tube itself is composed of only three basic parts: an electron
gun, an envelope, and a shadow-mask phosphor screen. The luminance efﬁciency of the electron optical system
and the phosphor screen is high. A peak beam current of under 1 mA in a 25-in. tube will produce a highlight
brightness of up to 100 ft·L. The major drawback is the power required to drive the horizontal sweep circuit
and the high accelerating voltage necessary for the electron beam. This requirement is partially offset through
generation of the screen potential and other lower voltages by rectiﬁcation of the scanning ﬂyback voltage.
