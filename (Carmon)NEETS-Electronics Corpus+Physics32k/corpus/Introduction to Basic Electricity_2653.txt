A  filter is a circuit that discriminates among 
 frequencies, attenuating (weakening) some while 
 allowing others to pass. It works by establishing a 
 cutoff point between frequencies that are passed and 
frequencies that are attenuated. The two most  common 
types of filters are low-pass filters and high-pass 
filters. A low-pass filter allows low frequencies to pass 
with little opposition while attenuating the high 
 frequencies. A high-pass filter permits  frequencies 
above the cutoff point to pass while attenuating 
 frequencies below the cutoff point.
