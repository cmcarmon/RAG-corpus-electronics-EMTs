The logic level inputs and corresponding outputs for a NOR gate are shown in figure 2-16. At time
T0, both K and L are LOW; as a result, f is HIGH. At T1, K goes HIGH, L remains LOW, and f goes
LOW. At T2, K goes LOW, L goes HIGH, and the output remains LOW. The output goes HIGH again at
T3 when both inputs are LOW. At T4 when both inputs are HIGH, the output goes LOW and remains
LOW until T5 when both inputs go LOW. Remember the output is just opposite of what it would be for an
OR gate.
