Transfer the paper doll components to a 0.100-inch 
grid graph paper (10 lines per inch). Component ori-
entation should be horizontal or vertical to the edge 
of the board. Identify the top and bottom layers with 
text component side and solder side. The solder side 
is viewed from the top like an X-ray view, as shown in 
Figure 48-12. Traces are then laid out left to right or 
top to bottom, with exceptions permitted. Traces may 
be routed between component leads, but not between 
the leads of semiconductor devices. At this stage, it 
may be necessary to reposition parts on the layout to 
avoid crossing traces. Once the paper doll components 
are placed and the traces are laid out, the decision to 
make a single-sided or double-sided printed circuit 
board can be identified. If no traces cross, a single-
sided printed circuit board is optimal; otherwise, a 
double-sided printed circuit board should be used.
