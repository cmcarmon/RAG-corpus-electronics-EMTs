Circuitry in a package is normally shown using standard logic symbols instead of individual
components such as transistors, diodes, and so forth. Figure 3-34 shows four examples of this type of
packaging. The numbered blocks (1-14 and 1-16) are the pins on the package. Circuit packages are also
identified by a manufacturerâ€™s part number. Similar circuits produced by different manufacturers will not
carry the same identification numbers in all cases.
