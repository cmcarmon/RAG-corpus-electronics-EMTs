Drivers
To communicate with a reader, the basic transmission is handled by three protocol layers: the physical layer,
the transport layer, and the command layer. The physical layer is related to the data transmission itself through
the  physical  port  (serial,  pcmcia,  usb,  etc.).  The  transport  layer  speciﬁes  the  transmission  type,  the  message
addressing, and handles the message validation. It deﬁnes how each byte transmitted by the physical layer is
interpreted  and  ensures  that  it  forms  a  consistent  and  valid  message.  Finally,  the  command  layer  speciﬁes
commands  that  are  transmitted  to  the  reader  to  execute  a  set  of  functions.  These  functions  will  allow  the
communication with a smart card and the management of events such as insertion and removal of the card.
In the communication process, the driver is a piece of software that hides the treatment related to the physical
and the transport layers. With documented interfaces, the user can use the command layer to send commands
to  the  reader  and  to  communicate  with  the  card.  Usually,  the  operating  system  integrates  drivers  that  take
charge of the physical layer. The device vendor will then write a ﬁlter driver that is placed over the other one
to wrap up the transport layer, transmitting commands into well-deﬁned packages. The driver will allow basic
commands  to  the  reader:  setting  parameters  of  the  readers  (communication  speed,  voltage  levels,  card  type
used),  setting  communication  parameters  between  reader  and  card  (protocol,  speed),  power  on,  power  off,
transmitting  bytes  to  the  card.  Moreover,  the  driver  must  manage  the  events  coming  from  the  system  and
control the states of the device. For instance, the insertion or the removal of the reader involves some processes
of initialization of the communication and registration of the connection. The driver must also allow the sharing
