Force  between  two  current-carrying 
conductors 
 
The mutual force which exists between two parallel 
current-carrying conductors will be proportional to 
the  product  of  the  currents  in  the  two  conductors 
and  the  length  of  the  conductors  but  inversely 
proportional to their separation. Thus:
