The  distortion  due  to  a  nonlinear  device  is  illustrated  in  Fig. 5.19.  For  an  input  X  the  output  is Y = F(X)
where  F  denotes  the  nonlinear  transfer  characteristics  of  the  device;  the  dc  operating  point  is  given  by  X0.
Sinusoidal  input  signals  of  two  different  amplitudes  are  applied  and  the  output  responses  corresponding  to
these inputs are also shown.
