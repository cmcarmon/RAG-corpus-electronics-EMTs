How do we model the Op Amp when it is in saturation? When an Op Amp
enters positive saturation, a near-short circuit forms between the Op Amp
output and the positive power supply. Similarly, when the Op Amp enters
negative saturation, a near-short circuit forms between the Op Amp output and
the negative power supply. Accordingly, simple positive and negative saturation
models for the Op Amp are illustrated in Figure 15.28. The normal dependent
voltage source is not shown in the saturation models because its output gets
limited by the power supply voltages and so it turns into a simple voltage source.
