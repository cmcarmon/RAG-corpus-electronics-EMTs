Special architectures for video communications can be found in the book VLSI Implementations for Image
Communications, published as the fourth volume of the series Advances in Image Communications (edited by
Peter  Pirsch)  by  the  Elsevier  Science  Publishing  Co.  in  1993.  The  informative  article “Research  on VLSI  for
Digital  Video  Systems  in  Japan,”  published  by  K.K.  Parhi  in  the  fourth  volume  of  the  1991  Ofﬁce  of  Naval
Research Asian Ofﬁce Scientiﬁc Information Bulletin (pages 93–98), provides examples of video codec designs
using  special  architectures.  For  video  programmable  digital  signal  processor  approaches,  see  I.  Tamitani,  H.
Harasaki,  and  T.  Nishitani, “A  Real-Time  HDTV  Signal  Processor:  HD-VSP,”  published  in IEEE Transactions
on  Circuits  and  Systems  for  Video  Technology,  March  1991,  and  T.  Fujii,  T.  Sawabe,  N.  Ohta,  and  S.  Ono,
“Implementation of Super High-Deﬁnition Image Processing on HiPIPE,” published in 1991 IEEE International
Symposium on Circuits and Systems, held in June 1991 in Singapore (pages 348–351).
