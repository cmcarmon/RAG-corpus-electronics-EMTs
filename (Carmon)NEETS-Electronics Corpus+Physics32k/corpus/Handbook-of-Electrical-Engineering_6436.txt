where the ratio J/S is the jammer-to-signal power ratio and the ratio Wss/Rb is the spreading ratio and is deﬁned
as the processing gain of the system. Since the ultimate error probability performance of the communication
receiver  depends  on  the  ratio  Eb/NJ ,  we  see  that  from  the  communicator’s  viewpoint  his  goal  should  be  to
minimize J/S (by choice of S) and maximize the processing gain (by choice of Wss for a given desired information
rate). The possible strategies for the jammer will be discussed in the section on military applications dealing
with AJ communications.
