• A pair of wires, which carry the electric signal
• Optical ﬁber, which carries the information on a modulated light beam
• An underwater ocean channel, in which the information is transmitted acoustically
• Free space, over which the information-bearing signal is radiated by using an antenna
• Data storage media, such as magnetic tape, magnetic disks, and optical disks.
