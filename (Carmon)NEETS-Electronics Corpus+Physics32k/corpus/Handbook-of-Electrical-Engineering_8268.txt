Most testing techniques are designed to be applied to combinational circuits only. While this may appear a
strong restriction, in practice it is a realistic assumption based on the idea of designing a sequential circuit by
partitioning the memory elements from the control functionality such that the circuit can be reconﬁgured as
(see
combinational at testing time. This general approach is one of the methods in 
Section 85.2). DFT encompasses any design strategy aimed at enhancing the testability of a circuit. In particular,
scan design is the best-known implementation for separating the latches from the combinational gates such
that  some  of  the  latches  can  also  be  reconﬁgured  and  used  as  either  tester  units  or  as  input  generator  units
(essential for built-in testing).
