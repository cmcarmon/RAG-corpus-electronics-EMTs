The most important support software for a designer is programs for checking the system, both for logical
ﬂow and for cycle-by-cycle activity. Often subtle errors and data dependencies will occur; ﬁnding them may
be a daunting task. Simulators are the ﬁrst-level checkout tools for programs. Simulators do not use the actual
hardware; rather they use a software model of it. They calculate and show the contents of all computer registers,
of ports and selected memory locations, so that an effective check of the internal operations can be made. Most
simulators are from third-party vendors.
