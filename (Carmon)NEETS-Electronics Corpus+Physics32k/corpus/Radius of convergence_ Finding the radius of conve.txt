Two cases arise. The first case is theoretical: when you know all the coefficients




c

n




{\displaystyle c_{n}}
then you take certain limits and find the precise radius of convergence. The second case is practical: when you construct a power series solution of a difficult problem you typically will only know a finite number of terms in a power series, anywhere from a couple of terms to a hundred terms. In this second case, extrapolating a plot estimates the radius of convergence.
