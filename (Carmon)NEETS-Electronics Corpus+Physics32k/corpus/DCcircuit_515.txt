For greater permanence, one might wish to choose soldering or wire-wrapping. These tech-
niques involve fastening the components and wires to some structure providing a secure me-
chanical location (such as a phenolic or ﬁberglass board with holes drilled in it, much like
a breadboard without the intrinsic spring-clip connections), and then attaching wires to the
secured component leads. Soldering is a form of low-temperature welding, using a tin/lead
or tin/silver alloy that melts to and electrically bonds copper objects. Wire ends soldered to
component leads or to small, copper ring ”pads” bonded on the surface of the circuit board
serve to connect the components together. In wire wrapping, a small-gauge wire is tightly
wrapped around component leads rather than soldered to leads or copper pads, the tension of
the wrapped wire providing a sound mechanical and electrical junction to connect components
together.
