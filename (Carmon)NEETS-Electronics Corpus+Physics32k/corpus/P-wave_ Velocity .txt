The velocity of P-waves in a homogeneous isotropic medium is given by

{\displaystyle v_{p}={\sqrt {\frac {K+{\frac {4}{3}}\mu }{\rho }}}={\sqrt {\frac {\lambda +2\mu }{\rho }}}}

where K is the bulk modulus (the modulus of incompressibility),



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the shear modulus (modulus of rigidity, sometimes denoted as G and also called the second Lamé parameter),



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the material through which the wave propagates, and



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is the first Lamé parameter.
Of these, density shows the least variation, so the velocity is mostly controlled by K and μ.
The elastic moduli P-wave modulus,

{\displaystyle M}
, is defined so that

Typical values for P-wave velocity in earthquakes are in the range 5 to 8 km/s. The precise speed varies according to the region of the Earth's interior, from less than 6 km/s in the Earth's crust to 13.5 km/s in the lower mantle, and 11 km/s through the inner core.
Geologist Francis Birch discovered a relationship between the velocity of P waves and the density of the material the waves are traveling in:
