the direction of electron ﬂow, acting as a power source. In this condition the inductor is said to
be discharging, because its store of energy is decreasing as it releases energy from its magnetic
ﬁeld to the rest of the circuit. Note the polarity of the voltage with regard to the direction of
current.
