Whether a computer addresses a group of bytes as a word or addresses each byte individually is a 
function of the circuitry. Both designs have advantages and disadvantages. Variable-word-length 
computers make the most efficient use of available storage space, since a character can be placed in every 
storage location. In a fixed-word-length computer, storage space may be wasted. For example, if the 
storage capacity in each address of a fixed-word-length computer is eight bytes, and some of the data 
elements to be stored contain only three or four characters, then many of the storage positions in each 
word are not being used.
