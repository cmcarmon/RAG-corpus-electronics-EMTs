The REFLEX KLYSTRON, shown at the right, is used only as an oscillator and uses only one 
cavity to bunch and collect the electrons. The frequency is determined by the size and shape of the cavity. 
The reflex klystron has several possible modes of operation which are determined by electron transit time. 
Electron transit time is controlled by the REPELLER voltage.
