However, if circuit components are series-connected in some parts and parallel in others,
we wonâ€™t be able to apply a single set of rules to every part of that circuit. Instead, we will have
to identify which parts of that circuit are series and which parts are parallel, then selectively
apply series and parallel rules as necessary to determine what is happening. Take the following
circuit, for instance:
