Physical calming measures can be uncomfortable for motor vehicle occupants and can impede emergency service vehicles. Compared to normal signed limits, zones can be expensive because of the engineering of traffic calming measures they may require. Noise, vibration and pollution can be caused by traffic slowing down and speeding up between the calming measures, though with the installation of average speed cameras in some areas, this is far less of an issue.
