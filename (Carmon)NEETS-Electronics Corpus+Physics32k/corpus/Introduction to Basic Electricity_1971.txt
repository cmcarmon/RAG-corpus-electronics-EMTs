Electrical or mechanical power relates to the rate at 
which work is being done. work is done whenever a 
force causes motion. If a mechanical force is used to 
lift or move a weight, work is being done. However, 
force exerted without causing motion, such as a force 
of a compressed spring between two fixed objects, 
does not constitute work.
