Figure 4.3: The Fourier series spectrum of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid is shown. The index indicates
the multiple of the fundamental frequency at which the signal has energy. The left column shows the
spectrum in terms of the classic Fourier series, the right in terms of the Fourier series coeﬃcients. We
will ﬁnd the latter representation more useful.
