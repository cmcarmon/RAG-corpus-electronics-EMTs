Due to the imaging principle, the polarization of radiation and
radiation patterns of a monopole antenna is the same as that of
its equivalent dipole antenna. However: the monopole antenna
has a ﬁeld only in the top half of the space, having zero
radiation below the ground plane. In contrast, the equivalent
dipole structure has ﬁelds in both sides, with the radiation to
the bottom side symmetric to that above. In this situation, the
expression of the directive gain functions in equations 6.141,
6.142, 6.159, and 6.160 (Das, 2004) can be used to show that
the directivity D of a monopole antenna is twice that of its
equivalent dipole structure.
