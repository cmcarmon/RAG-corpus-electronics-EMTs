in general, the two cosine terms in
this expression are not at the same frequency. The first term is the natural
response, at a frequency ωd, the damped natural frequency of the system. The
second term is the forced or driven response, at the frequency (ω1) of the
input signal. Thus one would expect interference or beating to occur between
these two components. Computer generated plots of v(t) (see Figure 14.3) from
Equation 14.21 show the interference effect clearly for ω1 ≈ ωd. Observation
of the response of any high Q resonant circuit1 to a step cosine slightly off the
resonant frequency will reveal such interference.
