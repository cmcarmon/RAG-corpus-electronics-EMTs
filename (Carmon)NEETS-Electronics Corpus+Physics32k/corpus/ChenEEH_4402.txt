This characterization of size of a TFM will be used to develop
quantitative measures of performance when the inputs are
sinusoids in a speciﬁed frequency band. Two other measures
will also be useful, and they can be deﬁned as induced gains
when the inputs and outputs belong to speciﬁed signal spaces.
Consider ﬁrst the set of energy signals that are vectors of
functions u that map R into Rp. The signal u is said to have
ﬁnite energy if:
