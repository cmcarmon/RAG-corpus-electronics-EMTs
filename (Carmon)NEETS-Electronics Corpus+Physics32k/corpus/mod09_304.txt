As stated earlier, crystals used in electrical circuits are thin sheets cut from the natural crystal and are 
ground to the proper thickness for the desired resonant frequency. For any given crystal cut, the thinner 
the crystal, the higher the resonant frequency. The "cut" (X, Y, AT, and so forth) of the crystal means the 
precise way in which the usable crystal is cut from the natural crystal. Some typical crystal cuts may be 
seen in figure 2-19.
