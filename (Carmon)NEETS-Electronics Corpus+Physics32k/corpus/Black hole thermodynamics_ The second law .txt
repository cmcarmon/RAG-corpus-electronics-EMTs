The horizon area is, assuming the weak energy condition, a non-decreasing function of time:

{\displaystyle {\frac {dA}{dt}}\geq 0.}

This "law" was superseded by Hawking's discovery that black holes radiate, which causes both the black hole's mass and the area of its horizon to decrease over time.
