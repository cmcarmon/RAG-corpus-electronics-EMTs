In the oil industry, quantities of crude oil are often measured in metric tons. One can calculate the approximate number of barrels per metric ton for a given crude oil based on its API gravity:





barrels of crude oil per metric ton

141.5
×
0.159





{\displaystyle {\text{barrels of crude oil per metric ton}}={\frac {{\text{API gravity}}+131.5}{141.5\times 0.159}}}

For example, a metric ton of West Texas Intermediate (39.6° API) has a volume of about 7.6 barrels.
