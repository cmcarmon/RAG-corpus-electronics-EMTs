used as a visual feedback element so that the operator can correct the position of the wand until the cursor is
properly placed. At this time the information from the tablet may also be transferred to either the host computer
or the resident desktop or portable computer, as desired. Since the cursor is not used to signal its position to
a pickup device, as is the case with the light pen, it may be used with any type of display system, including the
non-light-emitting ï¬‚at panel displays. Another advantage of the tablet is that it may be used to position cursors
in the blank areas of the display, where no light pulses are available unless they are specially generated by the
light pen.
