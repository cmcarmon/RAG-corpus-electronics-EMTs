The electrons closest to the nucleus are held to the atom with a stronger 
force than the electrons farther from the nucleus; some atoms hold on to 
their outer electrons with a vengeance, while others are a bit more lax. Just 
how tightly certain atoms hold on to their electrons turns out to be impor-
tant when it comes to electricity.
