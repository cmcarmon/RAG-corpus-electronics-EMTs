In the circuit shown in figure 3-22, the current is shown flowing in a counterclockwise direction.
Notice that the end of resistor R1, into which the current flows, is marked NEGATIVE (í���7KH�HQG�RI�51
at which the current leaves is marked POSITIVE (+). These polarity markings are used to show that the
end of R1 into which the current flows is at a higher negative potential than the end of the resistor at
which the current leaves. Point A is more negative than point B.
