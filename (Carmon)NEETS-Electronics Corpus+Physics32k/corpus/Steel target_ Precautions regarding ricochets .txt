If correct precautions are taken, the chance of ricochets when shooting at steel targets are minimal. The materials of which both the target and bullets are constructed should be chosen to cause the bullets to pulverize on impact, and therefore hardened steel targets and regular lead core bullets or copper jacketed bullets should be used. Unhardened steel should be avoided for use in targets, and ammunition with armor-piercing properties (i.e. steel cores) should also be avoided.
Furthermore, it is important always to shoot steel targets at an angle of 100 to 110 degrees relative to the target, with the angle specifically chosen such that the target is tipped slightly downwards 10-20 degrees off vertical so that any ricochet immediately strikes the ground. This angling of the target also minimizes distortion of the steel target, and prolongs the life of the steel target. Localized heating, causing loss of hardness, is also minimized by this proper choice of the angles when mounting steel targets. Steel targets must also not be solidly mounted, but must be mounted such that movement of the steel target can occur. This additionally reduces the loss of hardness, prolonging the life of the steel target.
It is important that shooters shoot only at steel targets that have stopped moving, such that the downward angle is safely available, to avoid ricochets. Blindly shooting at steel targets that are bouncing around is a recipe for disaster, with a strong possibility of unintended ricochets causing personal injury or damage to property.
