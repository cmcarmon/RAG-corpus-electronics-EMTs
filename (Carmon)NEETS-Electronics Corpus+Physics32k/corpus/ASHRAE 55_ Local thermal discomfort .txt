Radiant temperature asymmetry between ceiling and floor, and air and walls must be limited to reduce discomfort. To reduce draft risk at temperatures below 22.5 °C (72.5 °F), air speed due to the HVAC system must be 0.15 m/s (30 ft/min) or below. The vertical air temperature difference between ankle and head is limited to 3 °C (5.4 °F) for seated occupants and 4 °C (7.2 °F) for standing occupants. If occupants' feet will be in contact with the floor, the temperature must be 19–29 °C (66–84 °F).
