The selection of a technique or techniques depends on the
particular system requirement. However, automatic voltage
regulation is always provided by (1) bus regulation at the
substation, (2) individual feeder regulation in the substation,
and (3) supplementary regulation along the main by regulators
mounted on poles. Distribution substations are equipped with
load-tap-changing (LTC) transformers that operate automat-
ically under load or with separate voltage regulators that pro-
vide bus regulation.
