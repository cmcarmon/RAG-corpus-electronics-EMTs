Cole–Cole equation
This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows symmetric broadening
Cole–Davidson equation
This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows asymmetric broadening
Havriliak–Negami relaxation
This equation considers both symmetric and asymmetric broadening
Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function (Fourier transform of stretched exponential function)
Curie-von Schweidler law
This shows the response of dielectrics to an applied DC field to behave according to a power law, which can be expressed as an integral over weighted exponential functions.
