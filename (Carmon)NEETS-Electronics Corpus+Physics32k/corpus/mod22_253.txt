Operating systems are designed to provide various operating modes. Some systems can only do one 
task at a time, while others can perform several at a time. Some systems allow only one person to use the 
system, and others allow multiple users. Single user/single tasking operating systems are the simplest and 
most common on microcomputers. CP/M®-801, CP/M-86®1, and MS-DOS®2 are examples. Single 
user/multitasking operating systems allow you to do more than one task as long as the tasks don't use the 
same type of resources. For example, you can print one job while you run another, as long as the second 
job does not require the printer. Examples are Concurrent CP/M® -86 3, Concurrent® DOS 3, and MS-
DOS®; (3.0 and above). Multiuser/multitasking operating systems let more than one user access the same 
resources at the same time. This is especially useful for sharing common data. These are only feasible on 
processors (the functional unit in a computer that interprets and executes instructions) of 16 bits or more 
and with large memories. UNIX 4 is an example. There are also multiprocessor systems, shared resource 
systems. This means each user (or operator) has a dedicated microprocessor (cpu), which shares common 
resources (disks, printers, etc.).
