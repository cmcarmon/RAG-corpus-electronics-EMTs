FETs (pronounced “fetts”) come in two flavors — N‐channel and P‐channel —  
depending on the type of semiconductor material (N‐type or P‐type, respec-
tively) through which current flows. There are two major subtypes of FET: 
MOSFET (metal‐oxide‐semiconductor FET) and JFET (junction FET). Which is 
which depends on how the gate is constructed — which results, in turn, in dif-
ferent electrical properties and different uses for each type. The details of gate 
construction are beyond the scope of this book, but you should be aware of 
the names of the two major types of FETs.
