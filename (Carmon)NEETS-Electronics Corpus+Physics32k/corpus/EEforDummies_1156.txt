In a circuit with parallel branches, current splits at each node (the connec-
tion between branches). To measure how much current flows through one 
of the branches, you interrupt the circuit within that branch and insert your 
meter’s leads to reconnect the circuit. To measure how much overall current 
an entire circuit draws, you insert your meter’s leads in series with the posi-
tive power supply.
