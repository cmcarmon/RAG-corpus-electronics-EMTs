Asynchronous means “not occurring at the same 
time.” With respect to counter operations, asynchro-
nous means that the flip-flops do not change states 
at the same time. This is because the clock pulse 
is not connected to the clock input of each stage. 
 Figure  44-11 shows a two-stage counter connected for 
asynchronous operation. Each flip-flop in a counter is 
referred to as a stage.
