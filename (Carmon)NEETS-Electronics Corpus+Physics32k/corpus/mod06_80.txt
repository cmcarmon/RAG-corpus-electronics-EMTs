The circuits that we have discussed up to this point were chosen to show the general concepts
discovered by Edison and Fleming. They are not practical because they do no useful work. For now, only
the concepts are important. Practical circuitry will be presented later in this chapter as you learn specific
points about the construction, limitations, and other characteristics of modern diode tubes.
