Enables the assessment of multiple, co-existing faults and failures
Functions simultaneously in cases of failure and success
No need to anticipate end events
Areas of single point failure, system vulnerability, and low payoff countermeasures may be identified and assessed to deploy resources properly
paths in a system that lead to a failure can be identified and traced to display ineffective countermeasures.
Work can be computerized
Can be performed on various levels of details
Visual cause and effect relationship
Relatively easy to learn and execute
Models complex systems into an understandable manner
Follows fault paths across system boundaries
Combines hardware, software, environment, and human interaction
Permits probability assessment
Commercial software is available
