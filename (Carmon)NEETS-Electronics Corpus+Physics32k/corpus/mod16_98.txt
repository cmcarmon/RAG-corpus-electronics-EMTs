Testing and troubleshooting are the areas of maintenance that require the greatest technical skill.
Testing procedures are referred to as measurements, tests, and checks. The definitions of these terms
often overlap, depending on their use and the results obtained. For example, a power measurement and a
frequency check could constitute a test of the operation of the same radio transmitter.
