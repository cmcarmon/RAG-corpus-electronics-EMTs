Step 7
The state variables are the capacitor voltage  v3 and inductor current  i4, and the known independent sources
are ig and vg. To obtain the state equation, we must eliminate the nonstate variables v1 and i2 in Eq. (7.7). From
Eqs. (7.5b) and (7.8) we express v1 and i2 in terms of the state variables and obtain
