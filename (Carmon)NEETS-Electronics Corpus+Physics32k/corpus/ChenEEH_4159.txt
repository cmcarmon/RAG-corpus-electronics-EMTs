The basic technique for this combination is called pulse
code modulation (PCM). PCM takes the samples of analog
data at the sampling rate that is twice the highest signal
frequency and then assigns each sample to a binary code.
The analog data is quantized into 8 steps (0 to 7), an each
binary code will have 3 bits assigned to it. According to
the Nyquistâ€™s sampling theorem,
the samples contain all
information of the original signal and can be reconstructed
from these samples. The generated bit
stream will be
011110111111110100011100110.
