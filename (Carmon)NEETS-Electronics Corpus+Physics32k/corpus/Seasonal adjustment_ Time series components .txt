The investigation of many economic time series becomes problematic due to seasonal fluctuations. Time series are made up of four components:
St: The seasonal component
Tt: The trend component
Ct: The cyclical component
Et: The error, or irregular component.
The difference between seasonal and cyclic patterns:
Seasonal patterns have a fixed and known length, while cyclic patterns have variable and unknown length.
Cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are not of fixed period (duration usually of at least 2 years).
The average length of a cycle is usually longer than that of seasonality.
The magnitude of cyclic variation is usually more variable than that of seasonal variation.
The relation between decomposition of time series components
Additive decomposition: Yt = St + Tt + Ct + Et, where Yt is the data at time t.
Multiplicative decomposition: Yt = St * Tt * Ct * Et.
Logs turn multiplicative relationship into an additive relationship: Yt = St * Tt * Ct * Et => log Yt = log St + log Tt + log Ct + log Et:
An additive model appropriate if the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations does not vary with level.
If seasonal fluctuations are proportional to level of series, then a multiplicative model is appropriate. Multiplicative decomposition more prevalent with economic series.
