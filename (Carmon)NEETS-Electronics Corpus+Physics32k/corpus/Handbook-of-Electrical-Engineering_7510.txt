Digital logic circuits can be classiﬁed as belonging to one of two categories, either combinational (also called
combinatorial) or sequential logic circuits. The output logic level of a combinatorial circuit depends only on
the current logic levels present at the circuit’s inputs. Sequential logic circuits, on the other hand, have a memory
characteristic so the sequential circuit’s output is dependent not only on the current input conditions but also
on  the  current  output  state  of  the  circuit.  The  primary  building  block  in  combinational  circuits  is  the  logic
gate. The three simplest logic gate functions are the inverter (or NOT), AND, and OR. Other common basic
deﬁnitions  of  the  various  types  of
logic  functions  are  derived  from  these  three.  Table  79.1  gives 
logic gates. The memory elements used to construct sequential logic circuits are called latches and ﬂip-ﬂops.
The  integrated  circuit  switching  logic  used  in  modern  digital  systems  will  generally  be  from  one  of  three
families: transistor-transistor logic (TTL), complementary metal-oxide semiconductor logic (CMOS), or emit-
ter-coupled logic (ECL). Each of the logic families has its advantages and disadvantages. The three major families
are also divided into various subfamilies derived from performance improvements in integrated circuit (IC)
design  technology.  Bipolar  transistors  provide  the  switching  action  in  both  TTL  and  ECL  families,  while
enhancement-mode  MOS  transistors  are  the  basis  for  the  CMOS  family.  Recent  improvements  in  switching
circuit performance are also attained using BiCMOS technology, the merging of bipolar and CMOS technologies
on a single chip. A particular logic family is usually selected by digital designers based on such criteria as
