Resonating with RLC circuits
Look at the RLC circuit in Figure 8-7. Now imagine what happens to the 
 current, i, flowing through the circuit as you vary the frequency of the input 
signal, vin. Because the capacitor blocks DC and allows more and more 
 alternating current (AC) to flow as frequency increases, low‚Äêfrequency input
