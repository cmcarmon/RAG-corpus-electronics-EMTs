FLARM Technology and the inventors of FLARM have won several awards. The Swiss Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) also published in Dec 2010: "The rapid distribution of such systems only a few months after their introduction was not accomplished through regulatory measures, but rather on a voluntary basis and as a result of the wish on the part of the involved players to contribute towards the reduction of collision risk. The FOCA recommends that glider tow planes and helicopters that operate in lower airspace should also use collision warning systems."
In addition, FLARM is mandatory in several countries including France, and the Soaring Society of America (SSA) strongly recommends FLARM in lieu of ADS-B Out.
