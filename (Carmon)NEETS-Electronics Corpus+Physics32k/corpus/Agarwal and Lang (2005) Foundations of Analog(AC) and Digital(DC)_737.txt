Recall, that Yehaa’s adders behave as follows: For a logical 0, Yehaa’s adders produce
a voltage level of 0.5 V at their outputs. Similarly, when outputting a logical 1, their
adders produce the voltage level of 4.5 V. Yehaa adders are able to interpret all signals
between 0 V and 2 V at their inputs as a logical 0, and all signals between 3 V and 5 V
as a logical 1.
