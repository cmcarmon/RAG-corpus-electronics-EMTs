The optical setup of a schlieren imaging system may comprise the following main sections: Parallel beam, focusing element, stop (sharp edge) and a camera. The parallel beam may be achieved by a point-like light source (a laser focused into a pinhole is sometimes used) placed in the focal point of a collimating optical element (lens or mirror). The focusing element may be a lens or a mirror. The optical stop may be realized by a razor placed horizontally or vertically in the focal point of the focusing element, carefully positioned to block the light spot image on its edge. The camera is positioned behind the stop and may be equipped with a suitable lens.
