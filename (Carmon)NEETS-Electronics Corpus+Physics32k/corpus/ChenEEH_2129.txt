The engineering applications of electromagnetic ﬁelds
and waves usually require accurate solutions of Maxwell’s
equations subject to proper boundary conditions. Due to the
increasing capability of computers, many of the complicated
electromagnetic problems are now becoming solvable. Numer-
ical computation has become an indispensable subject in
electromagnetics. The two most widely applied numerical
