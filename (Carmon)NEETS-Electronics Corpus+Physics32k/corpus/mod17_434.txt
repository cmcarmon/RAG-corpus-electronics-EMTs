In recent years the volume of shipboard communications has increased greatly. This expansion has 
led to the shipboard installation of sophisticated equipment. Factors such as frequency accuracy and dc 
signal distortion are critical to the operation of communications systems. These systems demand precise 
initial lineup and monitoring to ensure satisfactory operations are maintained. System degradation is often 
caused by many small contributing factors. When these factors are added together, the system becomes 
unusable.
