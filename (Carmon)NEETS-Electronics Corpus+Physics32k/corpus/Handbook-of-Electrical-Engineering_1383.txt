Empirical Averages
This approach attempts to estimate the clean signal from the noisy signal in the MMSE sense. The conditional
mean estimator is implemented using the conditional sample average of the clean signal given the noisy signal.
The  sample  average  is  obtained  from  appropriate  training  sequences  of  the  clean  and  noisy  signals.  This  is
equivalent to using the sample distribution or the histogram estimate of the probability density function (pdf)
of the clean signal given the noisy signal. The sample average approach is applicable for estimating the signal
as  well  as  functionals  of  that  signal,  e.g.,  the  spectrum,  the  logarithm  of  the  spectrum,  and  the  spectral
magnitude.
