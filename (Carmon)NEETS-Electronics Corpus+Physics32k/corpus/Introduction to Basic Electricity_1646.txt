There are two instances where the third band does 
not mean the number of zeros. For resistor values of 
less than 10 ohms, the third band is gold. This means 
that the first two digits should be multiplied by 0.1. 
For resistor values of less than 1 ohm, the third band 
is silver. This means the first two digits are multiâ€‘
plied by 0.01.
