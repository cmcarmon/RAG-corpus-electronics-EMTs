INPUT OFFSET CURRENT IOS
The adverse effect of the input bias current mentioned would be nulliﬁed if both inputs were
connected to equal resistances (one of which could be a passive resistor) and if IBp = IBn. The
differential input would then be zero. However, if the input bias currents are unequal, as shown in
Figure 5.3.7, there will be a ﬁnite differential input voltage. It then becomes necessary to specify
the difference between the bias currents, and this is the input offset current IOS,
