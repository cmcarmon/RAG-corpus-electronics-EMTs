where [P] represents the polarization per mole, M the molar mass, do the density at a given temperature, and
e¢ = es. Equation (55.14) is equally valid, if the substitution e¢ = (n¢)2 is made; here n¢ is the real value of the
index  of  refraction.  In  fact,  the  latter  provides  a  direct  connection  with  the  dielectric  behavior  at  optical
frequencies. In analogy with the complex permittivity, the index of refraction is also a complex quantity, and
its imaginary value  n† exhibits a loss peak at the absorption frequencies; in contrast with the  e¢ value which
can only fall with frequency, the real index of refraction n¢ exhibits an inﬂection-like behavior at the absorption
frequency.  This  is  illustrated  schematically  in  Fig.  55.2,  which  depicts  the  kn¢  or  n†  and  n¢  21  values  as  a
function of frequency over the optical frequency regime. The absorption in the infrared results from atomic
