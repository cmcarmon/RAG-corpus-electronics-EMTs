Solving the preceding eight equations, we get v0 = 2 V, v1 = −9 V, v2 = 2 V,
v3 = −11 V, i0 = 2 A, i1 = −3 A, i2 = 1 A, and i3 = 3 A.
To show that energy is conserved, we need to compare the power dissipated by the
resistors and the power generated by the sources. The power into the resistors is given by
