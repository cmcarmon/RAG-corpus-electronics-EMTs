At this point, it becomes more clear how to choose the
constants to achieve a smaller bound. Recalling the expression
of Wd, note that one may ﬁrst want to have bd > 1, so Wd is
not made larger when divided by bd and so the convergence is
faster. This may be achieved by setting ci such that 2ccicm > 1
> 1.
(if enough knowledge is available to do so) and saj
However, having a large saj
makes Wd larger; this can be
< 1 or
offset, however, by also choosing the ratio saj
smaller. Finally, it is clear that making ki larger reduces the
effects of the representation errors and, therefore, makes Wd
smaller. Observe that there is enough design freedom to make
Wd small and bd large independently of each other.
