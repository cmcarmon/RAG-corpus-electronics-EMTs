Figures 2.6 and 2.7 show two ways to eliminate aliasing
using antialiasing ﬁlters. The analog signal is preﬁltered so
that the new maximum frequency fm is less than or equal to
fs=2. Thus, there are no aliasing components seen in Figure 2.6
0
because fs > 2f
m. Eliminating aliasing terms prior to sampling
is a good engineering practice. When the signal structure is
