The circuit and the power triangles are shown in Figure E3.1.9. The real power P = PS = PR
delivered by the source and absorbed by the load is not changed when the capacitor (considered
ideal) is connected in parallel with the load. After the capacitor is connected, noting that QC is
negative, QS = QL + QC = 100 tan(18.19) = 32.87 kVAR,
