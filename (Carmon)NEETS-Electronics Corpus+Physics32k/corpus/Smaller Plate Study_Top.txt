The Smaller Plate Study is an abbreviated title for an experimental study conducted by Dr Brian Wansink and Dr Koert van Ittersum: The Perils of Large Plates: Waist, Waste, and Wallet. The results claim that using 10 inch diameter plates instead of the traditional 12 inch diameter plates decrease the amount of food people eat without having an effect on their perceived fullness or satisfaction.
