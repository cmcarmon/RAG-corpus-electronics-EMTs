As you recall from previous studies in this series, semiconductors have electrical properties
somewhere between those of insulators and conductors. The use of semiconductor materials in electronic
components is not new; some devices are as old as the electron tube. Two of the most widely known
semiconductors in use today are the JUNCTION DIODE and TRANSISTOR. These semiconductors fall
under a more general heading called solid-state devices. A SOLID-STATE DEVICE is nothing more than
an electronic device, which operates by virtue of the movement of electrons within a solid piece of
semiconductor material.
