For both networks, find VO and φ as functions of VI and ω using impedance
methods.
For both networks, let R = 1000 , L = 47 mH, and C = 4.7 nF. Plot and clearly
label VO/VI for 2π × 103 rad/s ≤ ω ≤ 2π × 105 rad/s; use a linear axis for
VO/VI, and a logarithmic axis for ω. You need only plot enough points to outline
the dependence of VO/VI on ω.
