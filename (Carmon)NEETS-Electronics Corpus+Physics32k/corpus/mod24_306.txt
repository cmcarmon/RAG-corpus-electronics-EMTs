Stranded cable designs increase fiber counts without greatly increasing cable size. Stranded cables
are used when fiber counts exceed the limits of OFCC-type cables. For example, the stranded cable
design can accommodate about 48 fibers in a O.5-inch cable. The OFCC cable design can accommodate
around 12 fibers. The individual fiber is not protected as well in the stranded design as in the OFCC
design. For this reason more care is required in handling the individual fibers in the stranded design. The
primary problem of the stranded cable design is in meeting the waterblocking requirements. Once
manufacturers correct this design problem, the Navy expects that the stranded cable design will meet
Navy performance requirements.
