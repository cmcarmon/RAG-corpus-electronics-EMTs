Equations 12.124 and 12.127 have also been used to simplify the results. Note
that the unit step function u has been introduced into Equations 12.141 and
12.142 so that they are valid for all time. The validity of Equations 12.141 and
12.142 can be demonstrated by observing that they satisfy the initial conditions,
and Equations 12.119 and 12.120, respectively, for all time. Because they do,
our assumption that the states are continuous at t = 0 is justified.
Figure 12.28 shows vC and iL as given by Equations 12.141 and 12.142.
Notice the overshoot of vC above the input voltage V◦ during the initial tran-
sient. Although the average value of vC is close to V◦ during the transient, the
peak value is closer to 2V◦.
As expected, the ringing in both states now decays as t → ∞. This
decay is well characterized by the quality factor Q, as defined in W W W Equa-
tion 12.108 and discussed shortly thereafter. In fact, because the circuits shown
in Figures 12.15 and 12.26 have the same homogeneous response, the entire
discussion of α, ωd, and ω◦ given in Subsection 12.2 applies here as well.
