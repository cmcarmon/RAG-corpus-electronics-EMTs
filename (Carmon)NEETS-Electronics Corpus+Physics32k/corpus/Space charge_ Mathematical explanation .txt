If the "vacuum" has a pressure of 10−6 mmHg or less, the main vehicle of conduction is electrons. The emission current density (J) from the cathode, as a function of its thermodynamic temperature T, in the absence of space-charge, is given by Richardson's law:

A m−2 K−2
e = elementary positive charge (i.e., magnitude of electron charge),
me = electron mass,
k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38 x 10−23J/K,
h = Planck's constant = 6.62 x 10−34 J s,
φ = work function of the cathode,
ř = mean electron reflection coefficient.
The reflection coefficient can be as low as 0.105 but is usually near 0.5. For Tungsten, (1 - ř)A0 = 0.6 to 1.0 × 106 A m−2 K−2, and φ = 4.52 eV. At 2500 °C, the emission is 28207 A/m2.
The emission current as given above is many times greater than that normally collected by the electrodes, except in some pulsed valves such as the cavity magnetron. Most of the electrons emitted by the cathode are driven back to it by the repulsion of the cloud of electrons in its neighborhood. This is called the space charge effect. In the limit of large current densities, J is given by the Child-Langmuir equation below, rather than by the thermionic emission equation above.
