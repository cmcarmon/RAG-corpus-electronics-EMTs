Another type of claimed propellantless thruster, called the EmDrive by its inventor British engineer Roger Shawyer, has been proposed to work due to a Mach effect:
The asymmetric resonant microwave cavity would act as a capacitor where:
surface currents propagate inside the cavity on the conic wall between the two end plates,
electromagnetic resonant modes create electric charges on each end plate,
a Mach effect is triggered by Lorentz forces from surface currents on the conic wall,
a thrust force arises in the RF cavity, due to the variation of the electromagnetic density from evanescent waves inside the skin layer.
When a polymer insert is placed asymmetrically in the cavity, its dielectric properties result in greater asymmetry, while decreasing the cavity Q factor. The cavity's acceleration is a function of all the above factors, and the model can explain the acceleration of the cavity with and without a dielectric.
