may vary slightly for the same relay if subjected to the transi-
ents coming from different types of fault. The minimum
acceptable operating time is often established to make sure
that the relay will operate fast enough to meet other time-
critical criteria. For the transmission line protection example,
the overall time budget for clearing faults in a system is
expressed based on the number of cycles of the fundamental
frequency voltage and current signals. This time is computed
from the worst-case fault type persisting and potentially caus-
ing an instability in the overall power system. To prevent the
instability from occurring, the fault needs to be cleared well
before this critical time is reached, hence the deÔ¨Ånition of the
minimum fault clearance time. The relay operating time is
only a portion of this time-budget allocation. The rest is
related to the operation of circuit breakers and a possible
multiple reclosing action that needs to be taken. The consider-
ation also includes the breaker failure action taken in the case a
breaker fails to open and other breakers get involved in
clearing the fault. The relay operating time is a pretty critical
criterion even though it is allocated a very small portion of the
mentioned fault-clearing time-budget criteria. As an example,
the expected average operating time of transmission line relays
in zone 1 is around one to two fundamental frequency cycles,
where one cycle duration is 16.666 ms.
