7.91 The circuit in Fig. 7.150 is used by a biology student
to study “frog kick.” She noticed that the frog kicked
a little when the switch was closed but kicked
violently for 5 s when the switch was opened. Model
the frog as a resistor and calculate its resistance.
Assume that it takes 10 mA for the frog to kick
violently.
