Recall that in the relationship between frequency and wavelength, wavelength decreases as 
frequency increases and vice versa. Radio waves of frequencies below 30 megahertz normally have 
wavelengths longer than the size of weather turbulences. These radio waves are, therefore, affected very 
little by the turbulences. On the other hand, as the frequency increases into the vhf range and above, the 
wavelengths decrease in size, to the point that they become subject to tropospheric scattering. The usable 
frequency range for tropospheric scattering is from about 100 megahertz to 10 gigahertz.
