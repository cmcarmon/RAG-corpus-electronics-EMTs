One type of pencil iron is equipped with several different tips that range from one-fourth to one-half 
inch in size (diameter) and are of various shapes. This feature makes it adaptable to a variety of jobs. 
Unlike most tips that are held in place by setscrews, these tips have threads and screw into the barrel. This 
feature provides excellent contact with the heating element, thus improving heat transfer efficiency. 
"Antiseize" compound is generally applied to the threads of the tip each time a tip is installed into the 
iron. This allows the tip to be easily removed when another is to be inserted.
