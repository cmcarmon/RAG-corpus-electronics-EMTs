The graph GC for any circuit C can be determined by either
direct inspection of C, or by ﬁrst building the circuit multi-
graph and then modifying the multigraph to satisfy deﬁnition
4.3. Consider, for example, the circuit multigraph shown in
Figure 4.3—the corresponding circuit graph is illustrated in
Figure 4.4. Observe the labelings of the graph edges in Figure
4.4. Each edge is labeled with the corresponding permissible
range of the clock skew for the given pair of registers. An arrow
is drawn next to each edge to indicate the order of the registers
in this speciﬁc sequentially adjacent pair—recall that the clock
skew as deﬁned in deﬁnition 4.2 is an algebraic difference. As
shown in the rest of this section, either direction of an edge can
be selected as long as the proper choices of lower and upper
clock skew bounds are made.
