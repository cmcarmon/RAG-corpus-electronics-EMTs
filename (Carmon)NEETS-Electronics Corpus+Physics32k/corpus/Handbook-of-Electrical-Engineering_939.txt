Figure 13.12 shows the internal behavior of the device with Vgs = 3 V and Id = 3e-4A. The ﬁlled contours
indicate impact ionization, with the highest rate being near the edge of the drain right beneath the gate. This
is to be expected because this is the region in which the electric ﬁeld is largest due to the drain depletion region.
The dark lines indicate current ﬂow from the source to the drain. Some current also ﬂows from the drain to
the substrate. This substrate current consists of holes generated by the impact ionization. The triangular grid
used  in  the  simulation  can  be  seen  in  the  source,  drain,  and  gate  electrodes. A  similar  grid  was  used  in  the
oxide and silicon regions.
