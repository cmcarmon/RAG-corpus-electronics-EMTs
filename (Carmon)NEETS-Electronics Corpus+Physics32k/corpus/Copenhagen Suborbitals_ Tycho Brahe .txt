The micro space craft (MSC), named Tycho Brahe after the Danish astronomer, has a steel pressure hull, with room for one passenger. The passenger would be able to view the outside through a Perspex dome. The occupant would fly in a half-standing/half-sitting position, in a specially designed seat, and wearing anti-G trousers to avoid blackout. Another compartment contains both the high-speed drogue parachute and the low-speed main parachutes for deceleration. The sheer volume of the MSC will provide the buoyancy in the water upon touchdown.
The first MSC was christened "Tycho Brahe 1" and its first flight was uncrewed using a crash test dummy. A new aluminium MSC called MAX-1 named after Maxime Faget is under development. According to the group development on this capsule has been abandoned due to the physiological problems associated with large acceleration of a human in standing position. The craft is now on display in the Tycho Brahe Planetarium in Copenhagen.
