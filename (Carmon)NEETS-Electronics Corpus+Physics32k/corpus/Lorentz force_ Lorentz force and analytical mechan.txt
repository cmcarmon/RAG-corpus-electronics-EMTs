The Lagrangian for a charged particle of mass m and charge q in an electromagnetic field equivalently describes the dynamics of the particle in terms of its energy, rather than the force exerted on it. The classical expression is given by:

{\displaystyle L={\frac {m}{2}}\mathbf {\dot {r}} \cdot \mathbf {\dot {r}} +q\mathbf {A} \cdot \mathbf {\dot {r}} -q\phi }

where A and ϕ are the potential fields as above. Using Lagrange's equations, the equation for the Lorentz force can be obtained.

The potential energy depends on the velocity of the particle, so the force is velocity dependent, so it is not conservative.
The relativistic Lagrangian is

{\displaystyle L=-mc^{2}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}{c}}\right)^{2}}}+q\mathbf {A} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {r} }}-q\phi (\mathbf {r} )\,\!}

The action is the relativistic arclength of the path of the particle in space time, minus the potential energy contribution, plus an extra contribution which quantum mechanically is an extra phase a charged particle gets when it is moving along a vector potential.
