Step 1 in locating a problem for a malfunctioning 
circuit or a recently assembled printed circuit board is 
to visually check the printed circuit board over thor-
oughly before power is applied. Check the circuit for 
construction errors. The two types of construction 
 errors are improper component placement and wiring 
errors for discrete components. Discrete components 
are components not mounted on the printed circuit 
board.
