The Clown Walk is a variation of the Crip Walk. The dance is sometimes abbreviated as "C-walk," causing confusion as to whether people are Crip Walking, Clown Walking or Crown Walking. Clown is based on, and takes many moves from, the original Crip Walk; however, it has no gang affiliation and is generally a lot more complex. Clown Walk moves consist of basic V, Shuffle, Heeltoe, and X-hop. Dancers who utilize this particular form of dance often customize their own moves to make it unique.
