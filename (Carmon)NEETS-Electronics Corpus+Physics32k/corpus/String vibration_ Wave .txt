The velocity of propagation of a wave in a string (



v


{\displaystyle v}
) is proportional to the square root of the force of tension of the string (



T


{\displaystyle T}
) and inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density (



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
) of the string:




v
=



T
μ



.


{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {T \over \mu }}.}

This relationship was discovered by Vincenzo Galilei in the late 1500s.
