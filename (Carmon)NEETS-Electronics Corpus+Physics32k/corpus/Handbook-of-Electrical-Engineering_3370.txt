Device Fabrication
The fabrication of an integrated optic device uses the same techniques as used in the semiconductor IC industry.
Device  designs  are  Ô¨Årst  entered  into  a  computer-aided  design  (CAD)  system  for  accurate  feature  placement
and dimensional control. This design is then output as a digitized tape that will control a pattern generation
system for fabrication of the chrome masks that are used in device fabrication. A variety of equipment such as
step-and-repeat and E-beam systems has been developed for the semiconductor IC industry for the generation
of chrome masks. These same systems are used today for generation of masks for integrated optic devices.
