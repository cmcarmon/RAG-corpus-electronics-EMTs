The choice L ¼ 31=16, connected in parallel, removes the ﬁrst
term and another pole at the origin. The process can be
continued, with the resulting network shown in Figure 4.27.
It is not necessary to continue one type of the expansion to the
end. It is always possible, at any step, to rewrite the remaining
function like we did going from equations 4.54 to 4.55 and
continue. In addition, we need not remove one of the terms
completely. All this indicates that synthesis of LC impedances
or admittances is far from a unique procedure.
Let us return to equation 4.54, where we subtracted
L ¼ 1; we subtract now only L ¼ 0:5. The result will be as
follows:
