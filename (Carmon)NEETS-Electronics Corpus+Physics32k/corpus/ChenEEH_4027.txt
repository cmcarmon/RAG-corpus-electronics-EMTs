. The VLSI array compiler system (VACS) (Kung and Jean,
1988) is developed for systolic and wave front array
design. DG is captured and displayed in graphical format.
Other than scheduling and projection vectors required in
the spaceâ€“time mapping process, processor axes and local
memory size in each processor are optional inputs from
the user. The optimal SFG is obtained by enumerating
different criteria over a bounded search space.
