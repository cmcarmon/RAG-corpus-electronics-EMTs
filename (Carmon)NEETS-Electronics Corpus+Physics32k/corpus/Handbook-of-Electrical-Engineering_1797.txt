Pel Recursive Methods
Netravali and Robbins [1979] developed the Ô¨Årst pel recursive method for television signal compression. The
algorithm begins with an initial estimate of the displacement, then iterates recursively to update the estimate.
The iterations can be performed at a single pixel or at successive pixels along a scan line. The true displacement
D at each pixel is estimated by
