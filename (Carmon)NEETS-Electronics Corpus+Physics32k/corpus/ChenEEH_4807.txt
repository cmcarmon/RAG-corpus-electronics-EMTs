(1996) (which was 36) to generate the ﬁnal result statistics.
Every other simulation condition has been kept the same as
that in Santamaria et al. (1996). Each run was initialized to
u ¼ p and v ¼ 0. The number of trials listed in the table
corresponds to the one averaged over all of the successful
runs. The percentage of successful runs out of 60 was also
recorded in the table. Figure 13.5 shows a typical trajectory
of the pendulum angle under an NDP controller for a success-
ful
learning trial. This trajectory is characteristic for both
setting 1 and setting 2.
