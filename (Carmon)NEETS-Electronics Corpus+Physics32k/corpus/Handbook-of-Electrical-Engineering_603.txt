Harmonic distortion: Caused by the nonlinear transfer characteristics of a device or circuit. When a sinu-
soidal  signal  of  a  single  frequency  (the  fundamental  frequency)  is  applied  at  the  input  of  a  nonlinear
circuit,  the  output  contains  frequency  components  that  are  integer  multiples  of  the  fundamental  fre-
quency (harmonics). The resulting distortion is called harmonic distortion.
