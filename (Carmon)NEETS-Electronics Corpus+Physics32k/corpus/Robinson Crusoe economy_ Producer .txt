Assume that when the firm produces C amount of total coconuts,



Π


{\displaystyle \Pi }
represents its profit level. Also assume that when the wage rate at which the firm employs labour is w, L amount of labour will be employed. Then,




Π
=
C
−
w
L



{\displaystyle \Pi =C-wL\,}





C
=
Π
+
w
L



{\displaystyle C=\Pi +wL\,}

The above function describes iso-profit lines (the locus of combinations between labour and coconuts that produce a constant profit of Π). Profits can be maximised when the marginal product of labour equals the wage rate (marginal cost of production). Symbolically,
MPL = w
Graphically, the iso-profit line must be tangent to the production function.
The vertical intercept of the iso-profit line measures the level of profit that Robinson Crusoe's firm will make. This level of profit, Π, has the ability to purchase Π dollars worth of coconuts. Since PriceCoconuts is $1.00, Π number of coconuts can be purchased. Also, the firm will declare a dividend of Π dollars. This will be given to the firm's sole shareholder, Crusoe himself.
