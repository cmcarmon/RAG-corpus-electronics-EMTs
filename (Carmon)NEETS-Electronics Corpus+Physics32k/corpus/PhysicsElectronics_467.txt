The diﬀerential equations are linear only in the limit of small AC signals, where the
h parameters are eﬀectively constant. The h parameters are in general functions of the
variables IB and VCE. We arbitrarily picked IB and VCE as our independent variables. We
could have picked any two of VBE, VCE, IB and IC. Because the current and voltage variables
are mixed the h parameters are known as hybrid parameters.
