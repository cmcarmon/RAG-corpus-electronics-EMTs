Suppose that f : A → ℝ is a real-valued function defined on a subset A of ℝn, and that f is differentiable at a point a. There are two forms of the chain rule applying to the gradient. First, suppose that the function g is a parametric curve; that is, a function g : I → ℝn maps a subset I ⊂ ℝ into ℝn. If g is differentiable at a point c ∈ I such that g(c) = a, then

{\displaystyle (f\circ g)'(c)=\nabla f(a)\cdot g'(c),}

where ∘ is the composition operator: ( f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)).
More generally, if instead I ⊂ ℝk, then the following holds:

{\displaystyle \nabla (f\circ g)(c)={\big (}Dg(c){\big )}^{\mathsf {T}}{\big (}\nabla f(a){\big )}}

where (Dg)T denotes the transpose Jacobian matrix.
For the second form of the chain rule, suppose that h : I → ℝ is a real valued function on a subset I of ℝ, and that h is differentiable at the point f(a) ∈ I. Then
