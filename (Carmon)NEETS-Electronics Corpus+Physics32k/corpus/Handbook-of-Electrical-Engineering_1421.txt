Analysis of Excitation
In  a  simpliﬁed  form,  the  excitation  function  may  be  considered  to  be  purely  periodic,  for  voiced  speech,  or
purely random, for unvoiced. These two states correspond to voiced phonetic classes such as vowels and nasals
and unvoiced sounds such as unvoiced fricatives. This binary voicing model is an oversimpliﬁcation for sounds
such  as  voiced  fricatives,  which  consist  of  a  mixture  of  periodic  and  random  components.  Figure 15.7  is  an
example of a time waveform of a spoken /i/ phoneme, which is well modeled by only periodic excitation.
