Figure 1-13 shows two circuits connected together. Circuit number 1 can be considered as an a.c. 
source (ES) whose output impedance is represented by a resistor (R1). It can be considered as an a.c. 
source because the output signal is an a.c. voltage and comes from circuit number 1 through the output 
impedance. The input impedance of circuit number 2 is represented by a resistor in series with the source. 
The resistance is shown as variable to show what will happen as the input impedance of circuit number 2 
is changed.
