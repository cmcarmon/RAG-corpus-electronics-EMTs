Due to its high heat transfer efficiency, CuproBraze offers a significant amount of cooling capacity in a small size. This is because the same heat rejection level can be achieved with a smaller-sized core. Hence, a significant reduction in frontal area and volume is achievable with CuproBraze versus other materials.
