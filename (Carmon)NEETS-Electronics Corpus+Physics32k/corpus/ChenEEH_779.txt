Most of the communication applications like GSM require
digital coding of voice for efﬁcient, secure storage and trans-
mission. We have used a linear predictive coding (LPC) vo-
coder, also called a voice coder, that provides an analysis–
synthesis approach for speech signals (Rabiner and Schafer,
1988). In our algorithm, speech characteristics (energy, trans-
fer function, and pitch) are extracted from a frame of 240
consecutive samples of speech. Consecutive frames share 60
overlapping samples. All information to reproduce the speech
signal with an acceptable quality is coded in 54 bits.
The general characteristics of the algorithm are presented in
