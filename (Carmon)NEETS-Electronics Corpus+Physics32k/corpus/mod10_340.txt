These characteristics may be either harmful or helpful to radio wave propagation. For example, 
sporadic E may blank out the use of higher, more favorable ionospheric layers or cause additional 
absorption of the radio wave at some frequencies. Also, it can cause additional multipath problems and 
delay the arrival times of the rays of rf energy.
