Most operatings systems for large mainframes are direct de-
scendants of the third-generation systems, such as Honeywell
Multics, IBM VI and VM/370, and CDC Scope. These systems
introduced important concepts, such as time sharing, multi-
programming, virtual memory, hierarchical Ô¨Åle systems, and
device-independent I/O (Denning, 1971, 1976).
