*1.2.12 A practical current source is represented by an
ideal current source of 200 mA along with a shunt
internal source resistance of 12 k. Determine the
percentage drop in load current with respect to the
source short-circuit current when a 200- load is
connected to the practical source.
1.2.13 Let v(t ) = Vmax cos ωt be applied to (a) a pure
resistor, (b) a pure capacitor (with zero initial ca-
pacitor voltage, and (c) a pure inductor (with zero
initial inductor current). Find the average power
absorbed by each element.
2 sin 2π × 60t V is applied to
terminals A–B of problems 1.2.5, 1.2.6, 1.2.7, and
1.2.8, determine the power in kW converted to heat
in each case.
