The  conversion  just  described  is  called  the  radix  multiply  method  and  is  perfectly  general  for  converting
between fractions of different radices. However, as in the case of integer conversion, the requirement is that
the arithmetic required by .Ns · r must be carried out in source radix, s. For noncomputer use by humans, this
procedure  is  usually  limited  to  fraction  conversions  N10 ﬁ  Nr ,  where  the  source  radix  is  10  (decimal).  The
recommended methods for converting between fractions of different radices are given in Table 86.5. The radix
multiply method is well suited to computer use.
