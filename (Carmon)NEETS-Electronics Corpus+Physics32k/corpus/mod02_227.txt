For each of these codes, colored dots or bands are used to indicate the value of the capacitor. A mica
capacitor, it should be noted, may be marked with either three dots or six dots. Both the three- and the six-
dot codes are similar, but the six-dot code contains more information about electrical ratings of the
capacitor, such as working voltage and temperature coefficient.
