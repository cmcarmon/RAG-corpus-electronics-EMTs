columns (two on each side) of contact holes that are linked vertically. 
These columns, labeled + and –, are known as bus strips or power rails 
because they are typically used to distribute power along the length of 
the board. If you connect power (or ground) to just one hole in each of 
these columns, you can access that power (or ground) by running a wire 
from any other hole in those columns to a hole in a terminal strip.
You can’t tell exactly how many holes in each power rail are electri-
cally connected just by looking at the board. On some boards, such as 
the one shown in Figure 15-2, all contacts in each of the power rails are 
electrically connected, but other boards have a break in the connections 
halfway down each column. If there is a break, you can connect a wire 
between neighboring contacts to bridge the two separate sets of connec-
tions in each column.
