In a complex environment with several sources of stimulus, Braitenberg vehicles will exhibit complex and dynamic behavior.
Depending on the connections between sensors and actuators, a Braitenberg vehicle might move close to a source, but not touch it, run away very fast, or describe circles or figures-of-eight around a point.
This behavior is undoubtedly goal-directed, flexible and adaptive, and might even appear to be intelligent, the way some minimal intelligence is attributed to a cockroach. Yet, the functioning of the agent is purely mechanical, without any information processing or other apparently cognitive processes.
Often, BEAM robotics implements these sorts of behaviors.
