{\displaystyle g=G{\frac {m}{r^{2}}}}
is Earth's gravity. The field direction coincides with the angular moment direction, i.e. north.
From this calculation it follows that Earth's equatorial gravitomagnetic field is about 1.012×10−14 Hz, or 3.1×10−7 in units of standard gravity (9.81 m/s2) divided by the speed of light. Such a field is extremely weak and requires extremely sensitive measurements to be detected. One experiment to measure such field was the Gravity Probe B mission.
