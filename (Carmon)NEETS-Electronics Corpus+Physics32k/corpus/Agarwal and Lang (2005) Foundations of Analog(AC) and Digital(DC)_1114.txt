using basic calculus for circuit responses that are differentiable, which
basically includes all physically realizable analog circuits. Recall that the deriva-
tive of a function y = f (x) at the point xo is the slope of the function at that
(xo). As depicted in Figure 8.9, given a small change x from the
point, or f
