Figure 113.5  illustrates  the  response  of  the  myelinated  nerve  model  of  Fig.  113.4  to  a  rectangular  current
stimulus [Reilly et al., 1985]. The example is for a small cathodal electrode that is 2 mm radially distant from
a 20-mm ﬁber and directly above a central node. The transmembrane voltage DV is scaled relative to the resting
potential. The solid curves show the response at the node nearest the stimulating electrode. Response a is for
a  pulse  that  is  80%  of  the  threshold  current, b  is  at  threshold,  and  c  is  20%  above  threshold.  The  threshold
stimulus pulse in this example has an amplitude IT of 0.68 mA. Response a is similar to that of a linear network
with a parallel resistor and capacitor and charged by a brief current pulse. Responses b and c demonstrate the
highly  nonlinear  response  of  the  excitable  membrane.  The  dashed  curves  in  Fig.  113.5  show  the  membrane
response to a threshold stimulus at the three nodes adjacent to the one nearest the stimulating electrode. The
time delay implies a propagation velocity of 43 m/s, which is typical of a 20-mm ﬁber. The membrane response
seen  in  curves  b  through  f  illustrates  the  action  potential  described  earlier.  The  action  potential  is  typically
described  as  an “all-or-nothing”  response;  that  is,  its  amplitude  is  not  normally  graded—either  the  axon  is
excited, or it is not.
