MAGNETIC HEAD OPERATION.â€”Whether you're recording on magnetic tapes or disks, all
magnetic heads operate the same way. When an electric current passes through the coil of a magnetic
head, magnetic field lines associated with the electric current follow paths through the core material.
When the magnetic fields get to the head gap, some of them spread outside the core to form a fringing
field. When a recording medium is passed through this fringing field, it is magnetized in relation to the
electric current. This is called magnetic recording. Figure 1-4 illustrates this process.
