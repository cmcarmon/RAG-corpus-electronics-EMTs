Letting unshielded coils interact
When you place two unshielded coils near each other, the varying magnetic 
field created as a result of passing AC through one coil induces a voltage 
in that coil as well as in the other coil. Mutual inductance is the term used to 
describe the effect of inducing a voltage in another coil, while self‐inductance 
refers to the effect of inducing a voltage in the same coil that produced the 
varying magnetic field in the first place. The closer the coils, the stronger the 
interaction. Mutual inductance can add to or oppose the self‐inductance of 
each coil, depending on how you match up the north and south poles of the 
inductors.
