Both transmission capacities and nodal processing capabilities are available over a wide range of values. If
the trunk capacities are relatively low compared to nodal processing capability, then delays at switching nodes
may be relatively small. If line capacities are large compared to nodal processing capabilities, however, delays
due to nodal processing may be signiÔ¨Åcant. In the general case, all possible sources of delay should be examined
to determine where bottlenecks, and consequently delay, occur.
