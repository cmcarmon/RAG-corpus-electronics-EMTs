Attitude: The angular orientation of a satellite in its orbit, characterized by roll (R), pitch (P), and yaw (Y).
The roll axis points in the direction of ﬂight, the yaw axis points toward the earth’s center, and the pitch
axis  is  perpendicular  to  the  orbit  plane  such  that  R ·  P ﬁ Y.  For  a  GEO  satellite,  roll  motion  causes
north-south  beam  pointing  errors,  pitch  motion  causes  east-west  pointing  errors,  and  yaw  causes  a
rotation about the subsatellite axis.
