This result is the same as expressed in Equation 3.55. The remainder of
the node analysis, namely Step 5,
then proceeds to yield Equations 3.51
through 3.57 directly. It is important to note, however, that the node anal-
ysis of circuits containing dependent sources cannot always be easily simplified
in this manner.
