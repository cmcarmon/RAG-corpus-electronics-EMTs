The notion of illumination has to be differentiated from the notion of brightness. The footcandle is often used
for illuminance and is produced approximately by a source having a luminance of 1 fL (when the reï¬‚ectance
of the surface is 1), which makes the contrast calculation easy. However, these units must not be confused.
