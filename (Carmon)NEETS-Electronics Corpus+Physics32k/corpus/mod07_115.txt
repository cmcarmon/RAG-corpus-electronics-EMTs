Conduction in the N-type semiconductor, or crystal, is similar to conduction in a copper wire. That
is, with voltage applied across the material, electrons will move through the crystal just as current would
flow in a copper wire. This is shown in figure 1-15. The positive potential of the battery will attract the
free electrons in the crystal. These electrons will leave the crystal and flow into the positive terminal of
the battery. As an electron leaves the crystal, an electron from the negative terminal of the battery will
enter the crystal, thus completing the current path. Therefore, the majority current carriers in the N-type
material (electrons) are repelled by the negative side of the battery and move through the crystal toward
the positive side of the battery.
