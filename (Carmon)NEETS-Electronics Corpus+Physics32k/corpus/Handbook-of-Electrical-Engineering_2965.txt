When ampliﬁers are coupled together with capacitors, the conﬁguration is as shown in Fig. 28.3. The load
resistor is really the input impedance of the next stage. To be able to evaluate this ampliﬁer, a dc equivalent
circuit needs to be developed as shown in Fig. 28.4. This will result in the following dc bias equation:
