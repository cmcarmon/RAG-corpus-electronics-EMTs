In figure 1-7, commutation occurs simultaneously in the two coils that are briefly short-circuited by 
the brushes. Coil B is short-circuited by the negative brush. Coil Y, the opposite coil, is short-circuited by 
the positive brush. The brushes are positioned on the commutator so that each coil is short-circuited as it 
moves through its own electrical neutral plane. As you have seen previously, there is no voltage generated 
in the coil at that time. Therefore, no sparking can occur between the commutator and the brush. Sparking 
between the brushes and the commutator is an indication of improper commutation. Improper brush 
placement is the main cause of improper commutation.
