 testing, and veriﬁcation methods should be effective against the entire defect potential
of software, and not just against coding defects. Defect removal methods should approach 100% in efﬁciency
against severity 1 and severity 2 defects. Further, defect removal methods should deal with errors of omission
as well as errors of commission. Software operates at extremely high speed, so defect removal operations must
deal with timing and performance problems as well as with structural and logical problems. Finally, and most
difﬁcult, defect removal methods should deal with errors of clarity or ambiguity. These are challenging tasks.
