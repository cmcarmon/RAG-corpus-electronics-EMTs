The standard unit of length, metre, is realized by employing a stabilized Helium - Neon laser as a source of light. Its frequency is measured experimentally. From this value of frequency and the internationally accepted value of the speed of light (299,792,458 metres/second), the wavelength is determined using the relation:
Wavelength = Velocity of light / frequency
The nominal value of wavelength, employed at NPL is 633 nanometer. By a sophisticated instrument, known as an optical interferometer, any length can be measured in terms of the wavelength of laser light.
The present level of uncertainty attained at NPL in length measurements is ± 3 × 10−9. However in most measurements, an uncertainty of ± 1 × 10−6 is adequate.
