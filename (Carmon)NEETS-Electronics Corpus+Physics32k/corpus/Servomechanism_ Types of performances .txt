Servos can be classified by means of their feedback control systems:
type 0 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with a constant error signal;
type 1 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal, but a constant rate of change of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference;
type 2 servos: under steady-state conditions they produce a constant value of the output with null error signal. A constant rate of change of the reference implies a null error in tracking the reference. A constant rate of acceleration of the reference implies a constant error in tracking the reference.
The servo bandwidth indicates the capability of the servo to follow rapid changes in the commanded input.
