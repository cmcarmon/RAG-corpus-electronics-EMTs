It  is  readily  established  using  the  above  arguments  that  the  best  Toeplitz  approximation  to  a  matrix B  is
obtained  by  Ô¨Årst  determining  the  mean  value  of  each  of  its  diagonals  and  then  using  these  mean  values  as
entries of the best approximating Toeplitz diagonals. Let us formalize this important result.
