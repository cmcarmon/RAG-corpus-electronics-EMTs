In Fig. 22.17, rd is shown as the tangent in the dc operating point (VD, ID).
Note  that  rd  is  independent  of  the  geometry  of  the  device  and  inversely
proportional to the diode dc current. Thus for ID = 1 mA, m = 1 and VT
= 26 mV, the incremental resistance is rd = 26 W.
Diffusion Capacitance, Cd
Cd is associated with the injection of holes and electrons in the forward-
biased  diode.  In  steady  state,  holes  and  electrons  are  injected  across  the
junction. Hole and electron currents ï¬‚ow due to the diffusion gradients
on  both  sides  of  the  junction  in  Fig. 22.18.  In  a  short  diode,  holes  are
traveling a distance Wn  << Lpn. For injected holes, and since wn <<Lpn
