When the input signal developed by R1 goes negative, the current through Q1 decreases. This
decreased current causes a negative-going signal at the top of R3. This signal is felt on the emitter of Q2.
When the emitter of Q2 goes negative, the current through Q2 increases. This increased current causes
more of a voltage drop across R4. Therefore, the voltage at the bottom of R4 decreases and a negative-
going signal is felt at the output.
