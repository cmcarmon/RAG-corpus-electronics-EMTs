The electron is considered to be a small negative charge of electricity. The proton has a positive
charge of electricity equal and opposite to the charge of the electron. Scientists have measured the mass
and size of the electron and proton, and they know how much charge each possesses. The electron and
proton each have the same quantity of charge, although the mass of the proton is approximately 1837
times that of the electron. In some atoms there exists a neutral particle called a neutron. The neutron has a
mass approximately equal to that of a proton, but it has no electrical charge. According to a popular
theory, the electrons, protons, and neutrons of the atoms are thought to be arranged in a manner similar to
a miniature solar system. The protons and neutrons form a heavy nucleus with a positive charge, around
which the very light electrons revolve.
