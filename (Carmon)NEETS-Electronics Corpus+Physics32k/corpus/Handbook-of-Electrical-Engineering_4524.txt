2. The integral operator includes an explicit radiation condition, whereas the DE does not.
3. The  differential  operator  includes  a  capability  to  treat  medium  inhomogeneities,  non-linearities,  and
time variations in a more straightforward manner than does the integral operator, for which an appro-
priate Greenâ€™s function may not be available.
