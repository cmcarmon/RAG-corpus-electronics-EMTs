Make sure all your component leads are suitable for inserting into bread-
board holes. Clip long leads, if possible, so the components will lie flat and 
snug against the board. (Don’t worry if you can’t reuse them for another 
 circuit — they’re cheap enough.) Some components, such as potentio-
meters, may not have leads, so you’ll need to solder single‐core wires to their 
 terminals (see the section “Soldering 101,” later in this chapter for how to 
do this). Familiarize yourself with the polarity of parts, which leads are what 
on transistors,  potentiometers, and ICs. And finally, get interconnect wires 
ready, as described in the next section.
