There are many approaches that we can take to obtain the current I. For example, we
could apply the node method and determine the node voltages at nodes a and b and
thereby determine the current I. However, since we are interested only in the current I,
a full blown node analysis is not necessary; rather we will find the Th√©venin equivalent
(cid:3)
network for the subcircuit to the left of the aa
terminal pair (Network A) and for
(cid:3)
the subcircuit to the right of the bb
terminal pair (Network B), and then using these
subcircuits solve for the current I.
