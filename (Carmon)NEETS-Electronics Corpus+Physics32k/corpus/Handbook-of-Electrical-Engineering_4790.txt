Integration of ferroelectric or nonferroelectric materials with silicon devices and substrates has proved to be
very challenging. Contacts and control of the crystallinity and crystal size and the stack structure of the capacitor
device are the principal issues. In both volatile and nonvolatile memory cells the dielectric material tends to
interact with the silicon substrate. Thus an appropriate barrier layer must be incorporated while at the same
time obtaining a suitable substrate on which to grow the dielectric ﬁlms. A typical device structure starts with
an oxide layer (SiOx) on the silicon substrate followed by a thin titanium layer which prevents diffusion of the
ﬁnal substrate layer, platinum (the actual growth substrate).
