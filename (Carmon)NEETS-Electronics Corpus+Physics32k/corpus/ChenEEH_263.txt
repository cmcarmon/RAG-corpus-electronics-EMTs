Figure 1.28. Figure 1.29 shows the efﬁciency of this two-chan-
nel
interleaved center-tapped inductor VRM efﬁciency. Its
input voltage is 12 V, and its output voltage is 1.2 V. In
the test,
top switch, and two
MTP75N03DHs in parallel are used as a synchronous rectiﬁer.
This topology can achieve 80% efﬁciency at 1.2 V at a 60 A
output.
