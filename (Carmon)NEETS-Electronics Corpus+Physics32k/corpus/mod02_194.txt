The time scale (horizontal scale) is graduated in terms of the RC or L/R time constants so that the
curves may be used for any value of R and C or L and R. The voltage and current scales (vertical scales) are
graduated in terms of percentage of the maximum voltage or current so that the curves may be used for any
value of voltage or current. If the time constant and the initial or final voltage for the circuit in question are
known, the voltages across the various parts of the circuit can be obtained from the curves for any time after
the switch is closed, either on charge or discharge. The same reasoning is true of the current in the circuit.
