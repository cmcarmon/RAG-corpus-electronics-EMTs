There are ﬁve major classiﬁcations for magnetic materials as
brieﬂy discussed in this subsection (Inan and Inan, 1999; Paul
et al., 1998; Halliday et al., 1992). Diamagnetic materials have
wm < 1, and the remaining four types all have wm > 1. Because
of this, diamagnetic materials are repelled by a strong magnet,
whereas specimens of the other four categories are attracted to
a strong magnet.
