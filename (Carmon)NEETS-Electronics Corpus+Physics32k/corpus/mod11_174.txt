An analysis of the anodes in the hole-and-slot block reveals that the LC tanks of each cavity are in 
series (assuming the straps have been removed), as shown in figure 2-30. However, an analysis of the 
anode block after alternate segments have been strapped reveals that the cavities are connected in parallel 
because of the strapping. Figure 2-31 shows the equivalent circuit of a strapped anode.
