Signal Pre-Processing
An amplitude waveform and speech spectrogram of the sentence “Two plus seven is less than ten” is shown in
Fig. 15.16. The spectrogram represents the time evolution (horizontal axis) of the frequency spectrum (vertical
axis) of the speech signal, with darkness corresponding to high energy. In this example, the speech has been
digitized  at  a  sampling  rate  of  16  kHz,  or  roughly  twice  the  highest  frequency  of  relevant  energy  in  a  high-
quality speech signal. In general, the appropriate sampling rate is a function of the communication channel.
In  telecommunications,  for  example,  a  bandwidth  of  4  kHz,  and,  thus,  a  Nyquist  sampling  rate  of  8  kHz,  is
standard.
