Beam and polarization isolation: Frequency reuse allocates the same bands to several independent satellite
transponder channels. The only way these signals can be kept separate is to isolate the antenna response
for  one  reuse  channel  in  the  direction  or  polarization  of  another.  The  beam  isolation  is  the  coupling
factor for each interfering path and is always measured at the receiving site, that is, the satellite for the
uplink and the earth terminal for the downlink.
