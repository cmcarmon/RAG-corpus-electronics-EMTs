Tracking  radars  are  typically  characterized  by  a  narrow  beamwidth  and  moderate  bandwidth  in  order  to
provide accurate range and angle measurements on a given target. The antenna pattern is a pencil beam with
approximately the same dimensions in azimuth and elevation. Track is usually conducted at the higher frequency
bands in order to minimize the beamwidth for a given antenna aperture area. After each return from a target
