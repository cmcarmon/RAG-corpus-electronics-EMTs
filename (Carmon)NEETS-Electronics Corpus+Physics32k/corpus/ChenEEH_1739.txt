1. Error detection followed by Automatic Retransmis-
sion reQuest (ARQ): This approach requests retrans-
mission of lost or damaged packets. It is used by
Transport Control Protocol (TCP), a transport layer
protocol in the TCP/IP protocol stack, to provide reli-
able connection-oriented service. Applications that
require an error-free delivery of NRT media typically
use TCP for transport.
