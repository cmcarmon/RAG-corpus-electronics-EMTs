Considerable understanding of a video signal processing system can be gained by representing the system
with  the  block  diagram  given  in  Fig. 17.10.  Light  from  a  real-world  scene  is  captured  by  a scanning system
and causes an image frame f (x,y,t0) to be formed on a focal plane. A video signal is a sequence of image frames
that are created when a scanning system captures a new image frame at periodic intervals in time. In general,
each frame of the video sequence is a function of two spatial variables x and y and one temporal variable t. An
integral part of the scanning system is the process of converting the original analog signal into an appropriate
digital representation. The conversion process includes the operations of sampling and quantization. Sampling
