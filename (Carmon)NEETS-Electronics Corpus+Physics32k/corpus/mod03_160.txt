The ohmmeterâ€™s pointer deflection is controlled by the amount of battery current passing through the
moving coil. Before measuring the resistance of an unknown resistor or electrical circuit, the test leads of
the ohmmeter are first shorted together, as shown in figure 1-31. With the leads shorted, the meter is
calibrated for proper operation on the selected range. While the leads are shorted, meter current is
maximum and the pointer deflects a maximum amount, somewhere near the zero position on the ohms
