In some cases, the frequencies of two different generalized coordinates are identical, i.e.,




ν

k


=

ν

l




{\displaystyle \nu _{k}=\nu _{l}}
for



k
≠
l


{\displaystyle k\neq l}
. In such cases, the motion is called degenerate.
Degenerate motion signals that there are additional general conserved quantities; for example, the frequencies of the Kepler problem are degenerate, corresponding to the conservation of the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector.
Degenerate motion also signals that the Hamilton–Jacobi equations are completely separable in more than one coordinate system; for example, the Kepler problem is completely separable in both spherical coordinates and parabolic coordinates.
