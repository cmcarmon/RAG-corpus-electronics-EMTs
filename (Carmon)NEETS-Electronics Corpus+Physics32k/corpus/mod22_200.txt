The dot matrix is defined in terms of rows and columns of dots. A 5 by 7 matrix uses up to five 
vertical columns of seven dots to create a character. An example of a 5 by 7 matrix printing the letter H is 
shown in figure 2-25, view D. The size of dot matrixes varies from a 5 by 7 matrix to as large as a 58 by 
18 matrix. A number of dot-matrix printers use a single vertical column of pins to print characters, as 
shown in figure 2-25, view B. The characters are printed by moving (stepping) the print head a small 
amount and printing the vertical columns one at a time until the character is printed as shown in figure 
2-25, views C and D.
