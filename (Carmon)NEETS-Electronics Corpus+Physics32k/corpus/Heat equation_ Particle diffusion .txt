One can model particle diffusion by an equation involving either:
the volumetric concentration of particles, denoted c, in the case of collective diffusion of a large number of particles, or
the probability density function associated with the position of a single particle, denoted P.
In either case, one uses the heat equation

t

Δ
c
,



{\displaystyle c_{t}=D\Delta c,\quad }

or





P

t


=
D
Δ
P
.



{\displaystyle P_{t}=D\Delta P.\quad }

Both c and P are functions of position and time. D is the diffusion coefficient that controls the speed of the diffusive process, and is typically expressed in meters squared over second. If the diffusion coefficient D is not constant, but depends on the concentration c (or P in the second case), then one gets the nonlinear diffusion equation.
