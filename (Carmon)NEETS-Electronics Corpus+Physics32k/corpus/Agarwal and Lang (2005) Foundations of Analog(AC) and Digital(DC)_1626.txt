To obtain the worst-case dynamic power dissipation, we assume that the load capacitor
is charged and discharged every cycle. Under these conditions, Equation 11.27 gives the
formula for the worst-case dynamic power (with RON replaced by RONpd, where RONpd
is the resistance of the pulldown network). We rewrite this equation here by replacing
RON in the equation with the resistance of the pulldown network RONpd:
