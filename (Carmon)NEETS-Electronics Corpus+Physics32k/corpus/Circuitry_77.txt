 
(b)  The  lowest  value  of  resistance  would  be  
(39 $ (cid:1) 3.9 $) = 35.1 $. In  which case the 
 
current would be: 
 
 
I = V / R = 9 V / 35.1 $ = 256.4 mA 
At  the  other  extreme,  the  highest  value 
would be (39 $ + 3.9 $) = 42.9 $.
In this case the current would be: 
I = V / R = 9 V / 42.9 $ = 209.8 mA 
The  maximum  and  minimum  values  of 
supply  current  will  thus  be  256.4  mA  and  
209.8 mA respectively.
