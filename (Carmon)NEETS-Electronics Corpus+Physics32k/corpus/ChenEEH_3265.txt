power at high voltages and low current than low voltages and
high current. Conversely, lower voltages are safer and more
economic for end use. Thus, transformers are used to step-up
voltages from generators and then used to stepdown the volt-
age for end use. Another wide use of transformers is instru-
mentation: sensitive equipment can be isolated from the high
voltages and currents of the transmission system. Transformers
may also be used as means of controlling real power ï¬‚ow by
phase shifting.
