An inductor is essentially a coil of wire wound around a form using a core of air, magnetic metal, or
nonmagnetic metal. A core of magnetic metal produces greater inductance (for a coil of given size and
number of turns) than does an air core; a core of nonmagnetic metal produces less inductance than does
an air core. At frequencies in the hf and higher regions of the frequency spectrum, coils of small size and
