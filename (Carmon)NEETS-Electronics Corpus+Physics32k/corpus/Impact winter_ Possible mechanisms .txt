Although the asteroids and comets that impact the Earth hit with many times the explosive force of a volcano, the mechanisms of an impact winter are similar to those that occur after a mega-volcanic eruption induced volcanic winter. In this scenario massive amounts of debris injected into the atmosphere would block some of the sun's radiation for an extended period of time and lower the mean global temperature by as much as 20Â° C after a year. The two main mechanisms that could lead to an impact winter are mass ejection of regolith and multiple firestorms.
