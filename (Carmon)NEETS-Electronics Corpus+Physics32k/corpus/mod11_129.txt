The importance of understanding the decibel system of measurement can easily be seen in the case 
of receiver-sensitivity measurements. At first glance a loss of 3 dBm from a number as large as −107 
dBm seems insignificant; however, it becomes extremely important when the number indicates receiver 
sensitivity in the decibel system. When the sensitivity falls to −104 dBm, the receiver will only detect a 
signal that is twice as large as a signal at −107 dBm.
