Subjective Quality Ratings
There are two primary categories of subjective testing: category-judgment (rating-scale) methods and comparison
methods. Category-judgment methods ask the subjects to view a sequence of pictures and assign each picture
(video  sequence)  to  one  of  several  categories.  Categories  may  be  based  on  overall  quality  or  on  visibility  of
impairment (see Table 17.2).
