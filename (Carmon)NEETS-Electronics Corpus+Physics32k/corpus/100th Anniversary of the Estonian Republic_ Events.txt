The birthday celebrations of the Republic of Estonia will take place over the next 3 years.  The celebrations will kick off in April 2017 to mark a century since Estonia's administrative borders took their current form, will peak while events on various important dates take place throughout 2018 and 2019, and come to a grand close on the 2nd February 2020 when the 100th anniversary of the Tartu Peace Treaty will be honoured.
