Figure  4.23        This  small  1:1  ratio  toroidal 
transformer forms part of a noise filter connected in 
the input circuit of a switched mode power supply. 
The transformer is wound on a ferrite core and acts 
as a choke, reducing the high-frequency noise that 
would otherwise be radiated from the mains supply
