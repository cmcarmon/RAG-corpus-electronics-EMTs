"Contrary to the belief generally held by laboratory physicists, astronomy has contributed to the growth of our understanding of physics." Physics has helped in the elucidation of astronomical phenomena, and astronomy has helped in the elucidation of physical phenomena:
discovery of the law of gravitation came from the information provided by the motion of the Moon and the planets,
viability of nuclear fusion as demonstrated in the Sun and stars and yet to be reproduced on earth in a controlled form.
Integrating astronomy with physics involves
The aim of astronomy is to understand the physics and chemistry from the laboratory that is behind cosmic events so as to enrich our understanding of the cosmos and of these sciences as well.
