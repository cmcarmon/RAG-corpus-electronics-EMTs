The shell-form transformer construction features a short
magnetic path and a longer mean length of electrical turn.
Bean et al. (1959) point out that this results in the shell-form
transformer having a larger core area and a smaller number of
winding turns than the core-form of the same output and
performance. In addition, the shell-form will generally have
a larger ratio of steel to copper than an equivalently rated
core-form transformer. The most common winding structure
for shell-form windings are the primary–secondary–primary
(P–S–P), but it is common to encounter a shell form winding
of P–S–P–S–P. The winding structure for both the primary and
secondary windings are normally of the pancake-type winding
structure (Bean et al., 1959).
