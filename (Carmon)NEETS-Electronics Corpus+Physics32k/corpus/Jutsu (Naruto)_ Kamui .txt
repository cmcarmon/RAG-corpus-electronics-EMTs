Kamui (神威) is an ability that is exclusive to Obito's Mangekyo Sharingan, a space–time ninjutsu that allows the user to transfer himself or anything into a pocket dimension. At the time, Obito could only use his right eye for close range while partially transporting himself between spaces to appear "intangible" for minutes. Through Obito's left eye, Kakashi can create a long-ranged portal that is primarily based on line-of-sight and can increase in size. As a result, Obito and Kakashi are unable to use Kamui against each other as the attacks cancel each other. Once Obito regained his left eye, his abilities increase to the point where he can use his eyes to create two distortions and then connect them to produce a wormhole from one location to another. However, as this ability has nothing to do with his pocket dimension, it places a significant strain on Obito.
