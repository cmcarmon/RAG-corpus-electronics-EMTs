Following Franklin’s speculation of the wool rubbing something off of the wax, the type
of charge that was associated with rubbed wax became known as ”negative” (because it was
supposed to have a deﬁciency of ﬂuid) while the type of charge associated with the rubbing
wool became known as ”positive” (because it was supposed to have an excess of ﬂuid). Little
did he know that his innocent conjecture would cause much confusion for students of electricity
in the future!
