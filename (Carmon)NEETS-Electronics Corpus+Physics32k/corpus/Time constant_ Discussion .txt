This behavior is referred to as a "decaying" exponential function. The time



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
(tau) is referred to as the "time constant" and can be used (as in this case) to indicate how rapidly an exponential function decays.
Here:
t = time (generally

in control engineering)
V0 = initial value (see "specific cases" below).
