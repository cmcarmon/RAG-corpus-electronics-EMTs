In fact, with very few exceptions, three-phase synchronous machines are most commonly
used for power generation. In general, three-phase ac power systems, including power generation,
transmission, and usage, have grown most popular because of their economic advantages. An
elementary three-phase, two-pole synchronous machine with one coil per phase (chosen for
simplicity) is shown in Figure 12.2.3(a). The coils are displaced by 120 electrical degrees from
each other in space so that the three-phase voltages of positive phase sequence a–b–c, displaced
by 120 electrical degrees from each other in time, could be produced. Figure 12.2.3(b) shows
an elementary three-phase, four-pole synchronous machine with one slot per pole per phase. It
has 12 coil sides or six coils in all. Two coils belong to each phase, which may be connected in
series in either wye or delta, as shown in Figures 12.2.3(c) and (d). Equation (12.2.12) can be
applied to give the rms voltage per phase when N is treated as the total series turns per phase.
The coils may also be connected in parallel to increase the current rating of the machine. In
actual ac machine windings, instead of concentrated full-pitch windings, distributed fractional-
pitch armature windings are commonly used to make better use of iron and copper and to make
waveforms of the generated voltage (in time) and the armature mmf (in space) as nearly sinusoidal
as possible. That is to say, the armature coils of each phase are distributed in a number of slots, and
the coil span may be shorter than a full pitch. In such cases, Equation (12.2.12) is modiﬁed to be
