1. The coil remaining stationary with respect to the ﬂux, the ﬂux varies in magnitude with
time. Since no motion is involved, no energy conversion takes place. Equation (12.1.2a)
gives the transformer emf (or the pulsational emf ) as in the case of a transformer (see
Chapter 11), in which a time-varying ﬂux linking a stationary coil yields a time-varying
voltage.
