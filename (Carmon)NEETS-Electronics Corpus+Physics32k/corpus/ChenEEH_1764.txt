Error Requirements
As discussed in earlier sections, different media types have
vastly different error requirements, ranging from being com-
pletely error intolerant to being somewhat error tolerant
depending on the application. An error is said to have
occurred when a packet is either lost or damaged. Most
error-tolerant multimedia applications use error concealment
techniques to deal with lost or damaged packets by predicting
lost information from correctly received packets. Errors are
handled using various Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes
that can be used to detect and correct single or multiple errors.
The use of FEC codes implies that extra information has to
be added to the packet stream to handle errors. However, if the
communication path over which the packets are transmitted
introduces additional errors beyond the level of degradation
for which the FEC was designed, then some errors will remain
undetected or may not be corrected, and the performance will
surely degrade. Thus, it is essential for a multimedia applica-
tion to know the error characteristics of the communication
network so that an adequate level of FEC is introduced to
supplement the packet stream and protect against data loss
or damage. As an example, wireless networks usually rely
much more heavily on FEC than wired networks because the
latter has a higher probability of packet loss. The minimization
of packet retransmission achieved by using FEC can be too
costly in wired networks that are characterized by very low
probability of packet loss. The cost incurred is attributed to the
additional bandwidth required for the representation of FEC
information. The use of FEC is also critically dependent on the
application. For instance, in real-time applications, some level
of FEC is introduced for both wired and wireless communi-
cation networks because retransmissions are generally pro-
hibited due to delay constraints.
