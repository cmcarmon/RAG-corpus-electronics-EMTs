Equation 13.118 indicates that the voltage at the gate of the MOSFET is the
sum of two components: a DC bias voltage, R2VS/(R1 + R2), and ViÏ‰, the
time-varying component of the input. The values of R1 and R2 can be chosen
to achieve a desired input DC bias. Thus, from the viewpoint of biasing the
amplifiers, as shown in Figure 13.44, multiple amplifier stages can be designed
independently, and cascaded without the output bias of one stage impacting
the input bias of the next stage.10 The decoupling capacitor is instrumental in
