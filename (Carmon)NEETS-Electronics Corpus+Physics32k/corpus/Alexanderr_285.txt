Capacitors are commercially available in different values and types.
Typically, capacitors have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad 
(mF)
range. They are described by the dielectric material they are made of and
by whether they are of ﬁxed or variable type. Figure 6.3 shows the cir-
cuit symbols for ﬁxed and variable capacitors. Note that according to the

passive sign convention, if 
the
capacitor is being charged, and if 
the capacitor is discharging.
Figure  6.4  shows  common  types  of  ﬁxed-value  capacitors.  Poly-
ester capacitors are light in weight, stable, and their change with tem-
perature  is  predictable.  Instead  of  polyester,  other  dielectric  materials
such as mica and polystyrene may be used. Film capacitors are rolled
and  housed  in  metal  or  plastic  ﬁlms.  Electrolytic  capacitors  produce
very  high  capacitance.  Figure  6.5  shows  the  most  common  types  of
variable capacitors. The capacitance of a trimmer (or padder) capacitor
