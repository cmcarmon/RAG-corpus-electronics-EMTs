(cid:1) When we first introduced capacitors and inductors, we did so through the
effects that parasitic capacitance and inductance can have on the perfor-
mance of an electronic circuit. This in turn caused us to re-evaluate our
lumped matter discipline, under which such parasitics do not, by defini-
tion, exist. In the end we made a modeling compromise to preserve the
lumped matter discipline while admitting the existence of important par-
asitics. That compromise was to augment an original circuit with lumped
elements to model the important parasitics, with the understanding that
the augmented model obeys the lumped matter discipline. While this is
certainly an important issue, it is also important to realize that capacitors
and inductors are useful well beyond the modeling of parasitics. As we shall
see in future chapters they are frequently used on purpose.
