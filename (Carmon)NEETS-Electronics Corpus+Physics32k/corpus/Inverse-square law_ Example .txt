Let the total power radiated from a point source, for example, an omnidirectional isotropic radiator, be P. At large distances from the source (compared to the size of the source), this power is distributed over larger and larger spherical surfaces as the distance from the source increases. Since the surface area of a sphere of radius r is A = 4πr 2, the intensity I (power per unit area) of radiation at distance r is

{\displaystyle I={\frac {P}{A}}={\frac {P}{4\pi r^{2}}}.\,}

The energy or intensity decreases (divided by 4) as the distance r is doubled; measured in dB it would decrease by 6.02 dB per doubling of distance.
