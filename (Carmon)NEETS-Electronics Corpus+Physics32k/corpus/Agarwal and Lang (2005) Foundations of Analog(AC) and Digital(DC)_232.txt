To illustrate value discretization, consider the discretization of voltage as
shown in Figure 1.45. Here, we discretize voltage into a finite number of infor-
mation levels, for example, the two levels named ‘‘0’’ and ‘‘1.’’ Under this
quantization, if a voltage is observed to be below 2.5 V we interpret its value as
representing the information level ‘‘0.’’ If its value is above 2.5 V, we interpret
it as representing the information level ‘‘1.’’ Correspondingly, to produce the
information level ‘‘0,’’ we use any voltage less than 2.5 V. For example, we
might use 1.25 V. Correspondingly, to produce the information level ‘‘1,’’ we
might use the voltage 3.75 V.
