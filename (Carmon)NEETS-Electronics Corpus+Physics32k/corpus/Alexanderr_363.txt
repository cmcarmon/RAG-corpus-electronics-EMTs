The steady-state response is the value of the current a long time after
the switch in Fig. 7.48(a) is closed. We know that the transient response
essentially  dies  out  after  Ô¨Åve  time  constants. At  that  time,  the  inductor
becomes  a  short  circuit,  and  the  voltage  across  it  is  zero.  The  entire
source voltage
