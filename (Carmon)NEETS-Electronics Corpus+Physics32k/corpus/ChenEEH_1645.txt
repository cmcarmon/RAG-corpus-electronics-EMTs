In MPEG-1, due to the existence of several picture types,
GOP is the highest level of hierarchy. The ﬁrst coded picture in
a GOP is an I-picture. It is followed by an arrangement for P-
and B-pictures, as shown in Figure 6.4. GOP length is normally
deﬁned as the distance N between I-pictures. The distance
between anchor I/P to P-pictures is represented by M. The
GOP can be any length, but there has to be one I-picture in
each GOP. Applications requiring random access, fast-forward
play, or fast and reverse play may use short GOPs. GOP may
also start at scene cuts; otherwise, motion compensation is not
effective. Each picture is further divided into a group of
macroblocks, called slices. The reason for deﬁning slices is to
reset the variable length code to prevent channel error propa-
gation into the picture. Slices can have different sizes in a
picture, and the division in one picture need not be the same
as in any other picture. The slices can begin and end at any
macroblock in a picture, but the ﬁrst slice has to begin at the
top left corner of the picture, and the end of last slice must be
the bottom right macroblock of the picture. Each slice starts
with a slice start code and is followed by a code that deﬁnes its
position as well as a code that sets the quantization step size.
Slices are divided into macroblocks of size 16  16, which are
further divided into blocks of size 8  8 as in JPEG.
