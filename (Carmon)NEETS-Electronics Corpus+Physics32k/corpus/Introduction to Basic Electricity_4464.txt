Another type of flip-flop is called a  clocked 
 flip-flop. It is different from the RS flip-flop in that 
an additional input is required for operation. The 
third input is called the clock or trigger. Figure 44-4 
shows a logic diagram for a clocked flip-flop. A high at 
 either input of the flip-flop portion activates the flip-
flop, causing it to change states. The portion labeled 
 “steering gate” steers or directs the clock pulses to 
 either input gate.
