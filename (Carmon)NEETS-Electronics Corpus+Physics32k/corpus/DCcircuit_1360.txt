An obsolete name for an inductor is choke, so called for its common usage to block (”choke”)
high-frequency AC signals in radio circuits. Another name for an inductor, still used in modern
times, is reactor, especially when used in large power applications. Both of these names will
make more sense after you’ve studied alternating current (AC) circuit theory, and especially a
principle known as inductive reactance.
