A twin calorimeter provides a method of using two calorimetric bodies thermally shielded against 
ambient temperature variations and improves sensitivity. Figure 3-20 illustrates this type of calorimetric 
device. The power to be measured is applied to one calorimetric body; the other calorimetric body acts as 
a temperature reference. The steady-state temperature difference between the two calorimeters is used as 
a measure of rf power. Calibration is performed by applying low-frequency power. A differential-air, 
thermometer-type temperature difference indicator, shown in figure 3-21, is used with a twin calorimeter 
to measure microwave power in the 0.1-mW range. This instrument consists of two similar glass cells 
connected by a capillary tube containing a liquid pellet. Each glass cell contains a tapered, carbon-coated 
strip; and the entire assembly is mounted in a rectangular waveguide. Balancing dc power heats one strip; 
the other strip is heated by rf power. The liquid pellet, which indicates the differential expansion of the air 
within the two cells, is viewed through an aperture in the waveguide wall, preferably with a microscopy 
for highest sensitivity. This procedure permits a 2% accuracy at 10 mW.
