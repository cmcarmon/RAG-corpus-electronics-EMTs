Physically, semiconductor devices are much smaller than tubes. You can see in figure 1-1 that the
difference is quite evident. This illustration shows some commonly used tube sizes alongside
semiconductor devices of similar capabilities. The reduction in size can be as great as 100:1 by weight
and 1000:1 by volume. It is easy to see that size reduction favors the semiconductor device. Therefore,
whenever miniaturization is required or is convenient, transistors are favored over tubes. Bear in mind,
however, that the extent of practical size reduction is a big factor; many things must be considered.
Miniature electron tubes, for example, may be preferred in certain applications to transistors, thus keeping
size reduction to a competitive area.
