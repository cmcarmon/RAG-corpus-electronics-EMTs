Electronic circuits often have currents of different frequencies. The reason is that a source produces 
current with the same frequency as the applied voltage. As an example, the a.c. signal input to an audio 
amplifier can have high- and low-audio frequencies; the input to an rf amplifier can have a wide range of 
radio frequencies.
