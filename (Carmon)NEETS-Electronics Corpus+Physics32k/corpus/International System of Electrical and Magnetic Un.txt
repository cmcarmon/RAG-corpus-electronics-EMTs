The 1893 system of units was overdefined, as can be seen from an examination of Ohm's law:
V = IR
By Ohm's law, knowing any two of the physical quantities V, I or R (potential difference, current or resistance) will define the third, and yet the 1893 system defines the units for all three quantities. With improvements in measurement techniques, it was soon recognised that
1 Vint ≠ 1 Aint × 1 Ωint.
The solution came at an international conference in London in 1908. The essential point was to reduce the number of base units from three to two by redefining the international volt as a derived unit. There were several other modifications of less practical importance:
the international ampere and the international ohm were formally defined in terms of the corresponding CGS electromagnetic units, with the 1893 definitions retained as preferred realizations;
the preferred realization of the international volt was in terms of the electromotive force of a Weston cell at 20 °C (1.0184 Vint), as this type of cell has a lower temperature coefficient than the Clark cell;
several other derived units for use in electrical and magnetic measurements were formally defined:
International Coulomb
the electric charge transferred by a current of one international ampere in one second;
International Farad
the capacitance of a capacitor charged to a potential of one international volt by one international coulomb of electricity;
Joule
107 units of work in the CGS system, represented sufficiently well for practical use by the energy expended in one second by an international ampere in an international ohm;
Watt
107 units of power in the CGS system, represented sufficiently well for practical use by the work done at the rate of one joule per second;
Henry
the inductance in a circuit when an electromotive force induced in this circuit is one international volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one ampere per second.
