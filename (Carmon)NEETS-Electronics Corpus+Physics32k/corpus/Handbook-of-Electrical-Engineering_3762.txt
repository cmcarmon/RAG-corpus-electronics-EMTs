The  major  regions  of  the  earth’s  atmosphere  that  are  of  importance  in  radio  wave  propagation  are  the
troposphere and the ionosphere. At radar frequencies (approximately 100 MHz to 300 GHz), the troposphere
is by far the most important. It is the lower atmosphere consisting of a nonionized region extending from the
earth’s surface up to about 15 km. The ionosphere is the earth’s upper atmosphere in the altitude region from
50 km to one earth radius (6370 km). Sufﬁcient ionization exists in this region to inﬂuence wave propagation.
