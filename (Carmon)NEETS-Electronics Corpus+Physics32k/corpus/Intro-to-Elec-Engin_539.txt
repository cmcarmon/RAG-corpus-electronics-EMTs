Multiplexers
A multiplexer is a data selector, whereas a demultiplexer is a data distributor. A multiplexer
is a combinational network that selects one of several possible input signals and directs that
signal to a single output terminal. The selection of a particular input is controlled by a set of
selection variables. A multiplexer with n selection variables can usually select one out of 2n input
signals.
