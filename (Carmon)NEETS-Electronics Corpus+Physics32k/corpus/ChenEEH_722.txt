output buffer. When the next access is in the same page,
the row selection and sensing can be skipped. A high page hit
rate is obtained when the next three conditions are fulÔ¨Ålled.
First, the accesses need to be localized (local in every array).
Second, the data layout should match the page mapping.
Third, the memory access order in different arrays should
access these page members together. Obviously, array access
ordering and data layout freedom form the key factors.
