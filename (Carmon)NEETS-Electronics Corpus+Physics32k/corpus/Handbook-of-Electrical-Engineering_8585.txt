These are important applications. Even if most or all other programming needs can be better met in HLLs,
these applications are sufﬁcient reason for many engineers to want to know something about assembly language.
There  are  other  applications  of  assembly  language,  but  they  tend  to  be  speciﬁc  to  rather  specialized  and
infrequent tasks. For example, the back end of most HLL compilers is a machine code generator. To write one
of those, you certainly must know something about assembly language. On rare occasions, you may ﬁnd some
necessary machine-speciﬁc transaction which is not supported by the HLL of choice or which requires some
special  micro  optimization.  A  “patch”  of  assembly  code  is  a  way  to  ﬁt  this  inexpressible  thought  into  the
program’s vocabulary. These are rare events. The reason why we recommend to you this section on assembly
code is that it improves your understanding of HLLs and of computer architecture.
