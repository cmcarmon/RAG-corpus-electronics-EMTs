If  meaningful  skew  models  need  to  be  generated,  then  BSIM  and  BSIM2  are  very  difﬁcult  to  use,  again,
because  of  their  unphysical  parameter  sets.  Usually,  the  simplest  physically  based  model  is  the  best  for  skew
model generation. A more complicated physically based model such as BSIM3 may also be difﬁcult to use for
skew model generation.
