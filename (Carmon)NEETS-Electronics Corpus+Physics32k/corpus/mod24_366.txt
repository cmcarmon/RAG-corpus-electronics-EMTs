Fiber-end preparation begins by removing the fiber buffer and coating material from the end of the
optical fiber. Removal of these materials involves the use of mechanical strippers or chemical solvents.
When using chemical solvents, the removal process must be performed in a well-ventilated area. For this
reason mechanical strippers are used for buffer and coating removal in the shipboard environment. After
removing the buffer and coating material, the surface of the bare fiber is wiped clean using a wiping
tissue. The wiping tissue must be wet with isopropyl alcohol before wiping.
