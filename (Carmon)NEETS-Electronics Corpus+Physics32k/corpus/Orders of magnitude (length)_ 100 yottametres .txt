To help compare different orders of magnitude, this section lists distances starting at 100 Ym (1026 m or 11 billion light years). At this scale, expansion of the universe becomes significant. Distance of these objects are derived from their measured redshifts, which depend on the cosmological models used.
Distances longer than 100 Ym
130 Ym – redshift 6.41 – 13 billion light years – Light travel distance (LTD) to the quasar SDSS J1148+5251
130 Ym – redshift 1000 – 13.8 billion light years – Distance (LTD) to the source of the cosmic microwave background radiation; radius of the observable universe measured as a LTD
260 Ym – 27.4 billion light years – Diameter of the observable universe (double LTD)
440 Ym – 46 billion light years – Radius of the universe measured as a comoving distance.
590 Ym – 62 billion light years – Cosmological event horizon: the largest comoving distance from which light will ever reach us (the observer) at any time in the future
886.48 Ym – 93.7 billion light years – The diameter of the observable universe; however, there might be unobserved distances that are even greater.
>1,000 Ym (1 kYm or xennameter in older usage) – Size of universe beyond the cosmic light horizon, depending on its curvature; if the curvature is zero (i.e. the universe is spatially flat), the value can be infinite (see shape of the universe) as previously mentioned
