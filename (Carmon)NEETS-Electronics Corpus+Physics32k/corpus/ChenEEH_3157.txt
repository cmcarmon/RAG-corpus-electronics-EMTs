Outdoor environmental conditions vary over a wide range.
Temperature impacts the insulation properties of all materials
as the conductivity increases with temperature. For polymers
that are organic materials, ultraviolet (UV) radiation from
sunlight can break certain chemical bonds and cause cross-
linking on the surface, resulting in surface degradation. Mois-
ture in any form (e.g., rain, dew, fog, melting ice and snow)
lowers the surface insulation resistance signiÔ¨Åcantly from the
dry state. In the presence of contamination, the surface resis-
tance is reduced even more drastically. Altitude or the eleva-
tion above sea level affects the insulation properties. Higher
altitudes reduce the air density, hence, weakening the surface
insulation strength.
