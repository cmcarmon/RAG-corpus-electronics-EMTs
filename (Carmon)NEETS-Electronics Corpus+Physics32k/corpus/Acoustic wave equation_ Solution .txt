Provided that the speed



c


{\displaystyle c}
is a constant, not dependent on frequency (the dispersionless case), then the most general solution is




p
=
f
(
c
t
−
x
)
+
g
(
c
t
+
x
)


{\displaystyle p=f(ct-x)+g(ct+x)}

where



f


{\displaystyle f}
and



g


{\displaystyle g}
are any two twice-differentiable functions. This may be pictured as the superposition of two waveforms of arbitrary profile, one (



f


{\displaystyle f}
) travelling up the x-axis and the other (



g


{\displaystyle g}
) down the x-axis at the speed



c


{\displaystyle c}
. The particular case of a sinusoidal wave travelling in one direction is obtained by choosing either



f


{\displaystyle f}
or



g


{\displaystyle g}
to be a sinusoid, and the other to be zero, giving




p
=

p

0


sin
⁡
(
ω
t

k
x
)


{\displaystyle p=p_{0}\sin(\omega t\mp kx)}
.
where



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the angular frequency of the wave and



k


{\displaystyle k}
is its wave number.
