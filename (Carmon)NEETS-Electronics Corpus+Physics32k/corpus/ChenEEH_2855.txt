In theory, the RCS of a target can be determined by solving
Maxwell’s equations with proper boundary conditions. Only
objects with simple geometries, however, can be determined in
this way. The RCS of a simple conducting sphere as a function
of the normalized circumference (2pa=l, where a is the radius
of the sphere and l is the wavelength) is shown in Figure 10.1.
The RCS of this ﬁgure can be divided into the Rayleigh region,
the Mie or the resonance region, and the optical region. In
the Rayleigh region, where the size of the sphere is small
compared with the wavelength, the RCS varies with l4. In
the optical region, where the dimensions of the sphere are
