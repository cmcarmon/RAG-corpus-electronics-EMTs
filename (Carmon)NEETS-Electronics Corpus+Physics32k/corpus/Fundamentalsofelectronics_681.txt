Implementing the digital ﬁlter shown in the A/D block diagram (Figure 5.24) with a frequency-domain
implementation requires some additional signal management not required by time-domain implementations.
Conceptually, a real-time, time-domain ﬁlter could accept each sample as it becomes available, calculate
the diﬀerence equation, and produce the output value, all in less than the sampling interval Ts. Frequency-
domain approaches don’t operate on a sample-by-sample basis; instead, they operate on sections. They
ﬁlter in real time by producing Nx outputs for the same number of inputs faster than NxTs. Because they
generally take longer to produce an output section than the sampling interval duration, we must ﬁlter one
section while accepting into memory the next section to be ﬁltered.
In programming, the operation of
building up sections while computing on previous ones is known as buﬀering. Buﬀering can also be used
in time-domain ﬁlters as well but isn’t required.
