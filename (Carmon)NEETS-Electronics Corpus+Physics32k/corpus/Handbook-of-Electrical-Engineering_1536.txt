Continuous questions. If X is a continuous random variable that takes real values, a question about X has the
form: X ˛
 t where t is some real value. Instead of limiting the questions to a predeﬁned set, we could search
for the best subset of values taken by the random variable at any node and use the best question found. This
implies  that  we  generate  questions  on  the  ﬂy  during  tree  construction.  The  disadvantages  of  this  approach
include too much CPU time to search for the best subset and because there are so many subsets, there is too
much  freedom  in  the  tree-growing  algorithm,  resulting  in  over-training  or  spurious  questions  that  do  not
generalize very well.
