The CU usually has its own high-speed registers, local memory, and arithmetic unit. Thus, in many cases,
it is a conventional computer and the instructions are stored in a main memory, together with data. However,
in some machines such as ILLIAC IV, programs are distributed among the local memories of the PEs. Hence,
the  instructions  are  fetched  from  the  processorsâ€™  local  memories  into  an  instruction  buffer  in  the  CU.  Each
