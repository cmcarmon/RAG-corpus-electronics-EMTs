An SCR is a solid-state device consisting of four 
 alternately doped semiconductor layers. It is made 
from  silicon  by  the  diffusion  or  diffusion-alloy 
method. Figure 33-1 shows a simplified diagram of an 
SCR. The four layers are sandwiched together to form 
three junctions. Leads are attached to only three of the 
layers to form anode, cathode, and gate.
