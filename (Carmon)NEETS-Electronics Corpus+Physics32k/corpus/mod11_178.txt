earlier). Notice that electron Q1 is moving against the ac field around cavity A. The electron takes energy 
from the ac field and then accelerates, turning more sharply when its velocity increases. Thus, electron Q1 
turns back toward the cathode. When it strikes the cathode, it gives up the energy it received from the ac 
field. This bombardment also forces more electrons to leave the cathode and accelerate toward the anode. 
Electron Q2 is slowed down by the field around cavity B and gives up some of its energy to the ac field. 
Since electron Q2 loses velocity, the deflective force exerted by the H field is reduced. The electron path 
then deviates to the left in the direction of the anode, rather than returning to the cathode as did electron 
Q1.
