The order of the mode is also determined by the angle the wavefront makes with the axis of the fiber.
Figure 2-18 illustrates light rays as they travel down the fiber. These light rays indicate the direction of
the wavefronts. High-order modes cross the axis of the fiber at steeper angles. Low-order and high-order
modes are shown in figure 2-18.
