Post-type fuseholders are usually mounted on the chassis of the equipment in which they are used.
After wires are connected to the fuseholder, insulating sleeves are placed over the connections to reduce
the possibility of a short circuit. Notice the two connections on the post-type fuseholder of figure 2-11.
The connection on the right is called the center connector. The other connector is the outside connector.
The outside connector will be closer to the equipment chassis. (The threads and nut shown are used to
fasten the fuseholder to the chassis.) The possibility of the outside connector coming in contact with the
chassis (causing a short circuit) is much higher than the possibility of the center conductor contacting the
chassis. The power source should always be connected to the center connector so the fuse will open if the
outside connector contacts the chassis. If the power source were connected to the outside connector, and
the outside connector contacted the chassis, there would be a direct short, but the fuse would not open.
