One of the more interesting consequences of the advent of local-area networking is that many traditional
computer communication networks became internets overnight. LAN technology was used to connect stations
to a host computer, and these host computers were already on a WAN. It was then a simple matter to provide
a relaying, or bridging, service at the host in order to provide wide-area interconnection of stations to LANs
to each other. In short, the previously established WANs became networks for interconnection of LANs; that
is, they were interconnecting networks rather than stations. Internet performance suddenly became a primary
concern in the design of networks.
