Direct Current Behavior of a BJT
It is a fair assumption in present technologies to neglect
recombination in the base of a ‘‘useful’’ bipolar transistor.
According to equation 5.6, the excess electron density injected
into the base of a transistor with a simpliﬁed box doping
proﬁle N B reads, after series expansion of the sinh:
