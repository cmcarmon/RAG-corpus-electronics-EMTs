15.3.19 By a simple time multiplexing of natural samples
over a single line, a large radar site transmits 85
analog signals, each with 200-Hz bandwidth. If
the sampling is done at twice the Nyquist rate, one
time slot is used for synchronization, and the guard
time τg = 2τ , ﬁnd the duration τ of the pulse.
15.3.20 Sketch an ASK signal for the binary sequence 1 0
1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 if ωc = 3ωb = 6π/Tb.
15.3.21 In Equation (15.3.24), for coherent ASK, Eb =
A2Tb/4, with A = 2.2 V, Tb = 2.6 µs, and
N0 = 2× 10
−7 V2/Hz, ﬁnd Pe for a coherent ASK
system. Also, ﬁnd Eb for a 1- impedance.
*15.3.22 In Figure 15.3.14, when the pulse of a carrier of
amplitude A during 0 < t ≤ Tb arrives at point
R, show that D ∼= A2Tb/4 at time Tb if noise is
15.3.23 If Eb/N0 = 20 in a coherent ASK system, ﬁnd the
value of Eb/N0 that is needed in a noncoherent
ASK system to yield the same value of Pe as the
coherent system.
