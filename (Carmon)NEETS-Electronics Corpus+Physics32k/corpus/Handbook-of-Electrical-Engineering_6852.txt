Nonparametric detection is usually based on relatively coarse information about the observations, such as
the algebraic signs or the ranks of the observations. One such test is the sign test, which bases its decisions on
the  number  of  positive  observations  obtained.  This  test  is  nonparametric  for  the  model  in  which  the  noise
samples are i.i.d. with zero median and is reasonably powerful against alternatives such as the presence of a
positive constant signal in such noise. More powerful tests for such problems can be achieved at the expense
of complexity by incorporating rank information into the test statistic.
