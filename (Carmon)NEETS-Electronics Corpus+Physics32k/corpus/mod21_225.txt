Using an ohmmeter set to the R Â·  100 scale, measure the resistance between the drain and the
source; then reverse the ohmmeter leads and take another reading. Both readings should be equal (in the
100- to 10,000-ohm range), regardless of the meter lead polarity. Connect the positive meter lead to the
gate. Using the negative lead, measure the resistance between the gate and the drain; then measure the
resistance between the gate and the source. Both readings should indicate a low resistance and be
approximately the same. Disconnect the positive lead from the gate and connect the negative lead to the
gate. Using the positive lead, measure the resistance between the gate to the drain; then measure the
resistance between the gate and the source. Both readings should show infinity.
