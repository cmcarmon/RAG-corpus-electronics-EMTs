Subband coders evolved from the early work on quadrature mirror ﬁlters in the mid-1970s and continued
with polyphase ﬁlter-based schemes in the mid-1980s. Hybrid algorithms employing both subband and ADPCM
coding were developed in the latter part of the 1970s and standardized (e.g., CCITT G.722) in the mid- to late
1980s. Adaptive transform coders for audio evolved in the mid-1980s from speech coding work done in the
late 1970s.
