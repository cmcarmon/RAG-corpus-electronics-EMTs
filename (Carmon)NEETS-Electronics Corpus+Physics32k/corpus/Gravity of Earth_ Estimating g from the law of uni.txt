From the law of universal gravitation, the force on a body acted upon by Earth's gravity is given by

{\displaystyle F=G\,{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}=\left(G\,{\frac {m_{1}}{r^{2}}}\right)m_{2}}

where r is the distance between the centre of the Earth and the body (see below), and here we take m1 to be the mass of the Earth and m2 to be the mass of the body.
Additionally, Newton's second law, F = ma, where m is mass and a is acceleration, here tells us that




F

g



{\displaystyle F=m_{2}\,g\,}

Comparing the two formulas it is seen that:

{\displaystyle g=G\,{\frac {m_{1}}{r^{2}}}}

So, to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level, substitute the values of the gravitational constant, G, the Earth's mass (in kilograms), m1, and the Earth's radius (in metres), r, to obtain the value of g:

{\displaystyle g=G\,{\frac {m_{1}}{r^{2}}}=6.67384\cdot 10^{-11}\,\mathrm {m} ^{3}\cdot \mathrm {kg} ^{-1}\cdot \mathrm {s} ^{-2}\,\,\,{\frac {5.9722\cdot 10^{24}\,\mathrm {kg} }{(6.371\cdot 10^{6}\,\mathrm {m} )^{2}}}=9.8196\,\,{\mbox{m}}\cdot {\mbox{s}}^{-2}}

Note that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body, as measured on or above its surface, is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre. This is what allows us to use the Earth's radius for r.
The value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of g. The difference may be attributed to several factors, mentioned above under "Variations":
The Earth is not homogeneous
The Earth is not a perfect sphere, and an average value must be used for its radius
This calculated value of g only includes true gravity. It does not include the reduction of constraint force that we perceive as a reduction of gravity due to the rotation of Earth, and some of gravity being counteracted by centrifugal force.
There are significant uncertainties in the values of r and m1 as used in this calculation, and the value of G is also rather difficult to measure precisely.
If G, g and r are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the Earth. This method was used by Henry Cavendish.
