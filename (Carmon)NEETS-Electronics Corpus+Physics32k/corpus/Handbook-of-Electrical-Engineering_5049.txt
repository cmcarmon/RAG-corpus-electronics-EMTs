The IEEE Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation Society publishes regularly its  IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics
and Electrical Insulation, wherein many new developments in the Ô¨Åeld of dielectrics are recorded in permanent
form. It also sponsors on either an annual or a biennial basis a number of conferences, which provide a forum
for  rapid  dissemination  of  both  the  applied  and  fundamental  work  carried  out  on  dielectrics  and  electrical
insulating  systems.  The  reader  may  wish  to  consult  the  IEEE  Conference  Records  on  the  Annual  Report,
Conference on Electrical Insulation and Dielectric Phenomena, the IEEE International Symposium on Electrical
Insulation, and the Electrical/Electronics Insulation Conference. Also, a description of the different test methods
on dielectric materials may be found in the ASTM Book on Standards.
