Insulator design for voltage 230 kV and below is largely
dependent on lightning-produced surges, whereas for 345 kV
and above, the design is dependent on switching surges. How-
ever, regardless of the voltage class, in locations where contam-
ination is a serious problem, insulator design is determined by
the required contamination performance.
