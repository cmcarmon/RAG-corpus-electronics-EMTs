(f) Write an expression for |H(jω)|.
(g) What is the limit of |H(jω)| as ω goes to zero?
(h) What is the limit of |H(jω)| as ω goes to inﬁnity?
(i) What is the corner frequency?
(j) What is |H(jω)| at the corner frequency?
(k) Make a sketch showing the characteristics of |H(jω)| on a log-log plot. Label the
slope of the curve where possible, the corner frequency, and the value of |H(jω)|
at the corner frequency.
