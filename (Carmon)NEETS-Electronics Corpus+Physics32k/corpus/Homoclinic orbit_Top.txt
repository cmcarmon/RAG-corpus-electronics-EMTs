In mathematics, a homoclinic orbit is a trajectory of a flow of a dynamical system which joins a saddle equilibrium point to itself. More precisely, a homoclinic orbit lies in the intersection of the stable manifold and the unstable manifold of an equilibrium.
Consider the continuous dynamical system described by the ODE

{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}=f(x)}

Suppose there is an equilibrium at

{\displaystyle \Phi (t)\rightarrow x_{0}\quad \mathrm {as} \quad t\rightarrow \pm \infty }

If the phase space has three or more dimensions, then it is important to consider the topology of the unstable manifold of the saddle point. The figures show two cases. First, when the unstable manifold is topologically a cylinder, and secondly, when the unstable manifold is topologically a Möbius strip; in this case the homoclinic orbit is called twisted.
