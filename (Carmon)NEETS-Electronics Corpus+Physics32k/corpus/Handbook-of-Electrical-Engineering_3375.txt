Integrated  optic  devices  built  on  LiNbO3  are  inherently  single-mode  devices.  This  means  that  the  light  is
conﬁned in a cross-sectional area of approximately 30 mm2. The optical mode has a near-ﬁeld pattern that is
5 to 10 mm across and 3 to 6 mm deep, depending on the wavelength. These mode spot sizes set limits on how
light  can  be  coupled  in  and  out.  There  are  a  number  of  methods  that  can  be  used  to  couple  the  light  into
LiNbO3 waveguides. These include prism coupling, grating coupling, end-ﬁre coupling with lenses, and end-
ﬁre coupling with single-mode optical ﬁbers. In general, most of these techniques are only useful for laboratory
purposes. The most practical real-world technique is end-ﬁre coupling with an optical ﬁber. In this case the
optical ﬁber is aligned to the waveguide end. This is an excellent practical method since integrated optic devices
are  most  often  used  in  ﬁber  optic  systems.  Therefore,  the  coupling  problem  is  one  of  aligning  and  ﬁxing  a
single-mode ﬁber to the single-mode LiNbO3 waveguide. The size of the single-mode radiation pattern and its
angular divergence set the alignment tolerances. A low-loss connection between a ﬁber and a LiNbO3 waveguide
requires <1/20 of a mode spot diameter (0.25–0.5 mm) in transverse offset, angular tilt of <2 degrees, and a
longitudinal  offset  of  <1  mode  spot  diameter  (5–10 mm).  These  are  very  stringent  alignment  requirements,
especially if they have to be maintained over a wide temperature range.
