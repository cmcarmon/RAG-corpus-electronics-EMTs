We will be discussing a 1,000 watt, single-sideband radio transmitting set that is available to the 
Navy in any one of four setups. The normal configuration has a transmitter capable of voice, continuous 
wave, and radio teletypewriter transmissions in the 2- to 30-megahertz frequency range. Exact spacing 
and number of channels available within the frequency spectrum, modes of operation, and frequency 
range depend on the model of equipment and how it is configured for use. Stack or rack mounting is used 
in a ship or shore permanent installation with accessory equipment (for example an rf amplifier, coupler 
control unit, or power supply) to form a complete communications system. One of three different three-
phase primary power sources can be used (depending on whether the transmitter is land, air, or shore 
based) to provide operating power to the set. Combinations available are 115 volts, 400 hertz; or 208/440 
volts, 60 hertz.
