gated-beam detector is shown in figure 3-16. It uses a gated-beam tube to limit, detect, and amplify the
received fm signal. The output voltage is 0 when the input frequency is equal to the center frequency.
When the input frequency rises above the center frequency, the output voltage goes positive. When the
input frequency drops below the center frequency, the output voltage goes negative.
