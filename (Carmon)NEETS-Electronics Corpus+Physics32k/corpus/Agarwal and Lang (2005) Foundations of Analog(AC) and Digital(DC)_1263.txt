In Section 2.3.4, we saw that the resistances of resistors in series add, and that
the conductances of resistors in parallel add. Thus, series and parallel resistors
could be represented as a single resistor with an appropriate resistance. These
addition rules later became useful as a means of simplifying circuits and their
analyses. As we shall see in this section, similar rules may be derived for both
capacitors and inductors, and these rules are equally useful.
