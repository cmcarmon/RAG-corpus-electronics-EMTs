m o s f e t a m p l i f i e r The circuit shown in Figure 7.46 is a MOSFET ampli-
fier. We wish to determine the large-signal input-output behavior of this amplifier. We
also wish to determine the range of vIN over which the MOSFET operation remains in
the saturation region. In this example, we will assume that the MOSFET is characterized
by VT = 1 V and K = 1 mA/V2.
Resistors R1 and R2 form a voltage divider from VS that establishes the constant bias
voltage VB at the gate of the MOSFET. That bias voltage is VB = 1.6 V.
