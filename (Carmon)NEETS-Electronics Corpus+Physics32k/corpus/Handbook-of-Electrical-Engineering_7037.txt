When the possible messages are all equally likely, then it makes sense to represent them by strings of equal
length. For example, if there are 32 possible equally likely messages, then each message can be represented by
a binary string of 5 bits. However, if the messages are not equally likely, then it is more efﬁcient on the average
to allot short strings to the frequently occurring messages and longer strings to the rare messages. Thus, the
Morse  code  allots  the  shortest  string  (a  dot)  to  the  most  frequent  letter  (E)  and  allots  long  strings  to  the
infrequent letters (e.g., dash, dash, dot, dash for Q). The minimum average length of the representation is a
fundamental quantity called the entropy of the source, which is deﬁned in the next subsection.
