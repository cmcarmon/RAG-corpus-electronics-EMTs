There still remains the question of how the number 0 is to be represented. If the  F ﬁeld is zero, then the
exponent can be anything and the number will be zero. However, in computers the normalized FPN2 limits  F
to 0.5 £ F < 1 since the MSB for  F is always 1. The solution to this problem is to assume that the number is
zero if the exponent bits are all zero regardless of the value of the mantissa. This leads, however, to a discontinuity
in normalized FPN2 representation at the low end.
