{\displaystyle \int _{t_{0}}^{t}f(\tau )d\tau }
represents the system output



y

{\displaystyle y(t)\,}
when



y

)
=
0.



{\displaystyle y(t_{0})=0.\,}

When there is no influence from internal voltages or currents due to previously charged components

{\displaystyle y(t)=\int _{t_{0}}^{t}f(\tau )d\tau .\,}

Zero state response varies with the system input and under zero-state conditions we could say that two independent inputs results in two independent outputs:





f

1


(
t
)



{\displaystyle f_{1}(t)\,}





y

1


(
t
)



{\displaystyle y_{1}(t)\,}

and





f

2


(
t
)



{\displaystyle f_{2}(t)\,}





y

2


(
t
)
.



{\displaystyle y_{2}(t).\,}

Because of linearity we can then apply the principles of superposition to achieve

{\displaystyle Kf_{1}(t)+Kf_{2}(t)\,}
