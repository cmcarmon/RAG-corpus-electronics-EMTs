Other non-idealities include core loss and inter-turn capacitance. These
characteristics limit the power-handling efficiency of a real inductor, and the
frequency range over which a real inductor behaves like an ideal inductor. They
can often be modeled with a parallel resistor and capacitor, respectively.
