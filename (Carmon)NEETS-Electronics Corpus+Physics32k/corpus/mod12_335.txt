Remember, in pulse modulation the sidebands produced to accompany the carrier during
transmission are directly related to the harmonic content of the modulating wave shape. In figure 2-31,
(view A, view B and view C), observe the square and rectangular wave shapes used to pulse modulate the
same carrier frequency in each of the three views.
