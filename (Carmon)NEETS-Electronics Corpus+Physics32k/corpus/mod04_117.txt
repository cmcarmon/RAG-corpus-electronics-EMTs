Terminals that are used with aluminum wire are made of aluminum. Proper crimping is more 
difficult with these terminals because of such factors as aluminum creep and softness. Aluminum wire has 
an undesirable characteristic called aluminum creep. Aluminum has the tendency to actually move away 
from the point where pressure is applied. This is not only true during the crimping operation but also 
takes place during temperature changes. The aluminum wire is softer than the terminal lugs and splice 
connectors and contracts faster than the connector when the temperature drops. This causes the wires to 
creep away from the crimped connections, which, in turn, causes loose connections. The softness of 
aluminum wire also makes it subject to being cut or nicked during stripping. You should be careful never 
to use an aluminum terminal with copper wire or a copper terminal with aluminum wire because of 
electrolysis. Electrolysis is the chemical action that takes place when an electric current passes through 
two dissimilar metals. This chemical action corrodes (eats away) the metal. Also, never use the aluminum 
crimping tool for crimping other than the aluminum terminals. Aluminum terminal lugs and splices are 
not insulated, so you must use spaghetti or heat-shrinkable tubing for insulation as discussed earlier.
