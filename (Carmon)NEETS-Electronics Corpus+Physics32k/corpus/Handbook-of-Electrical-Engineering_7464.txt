Once  the  signal  has  passed  though  the  channel,  the  original  message  is  recovered  by  a  receiver.  This  can
typically be realized by a sequence of digital ﬁlters, feedback loops, and appropriately selected nonlinear devices.
A receiver encounters a number of clearly identiﬁable problems that one may wish to address independently.
For example, receivers must initially synchronize themselves to the incoming signal. This may involve detecting
that  an  input  signal  is  present,  acquiring  an  estimate  of  the  carrier  amplitude,  frequency,  phase,  symbol
synchronization,  frame  synchronization,  and,  in  the  case  of  spread  spectrum  systems,  code  synchronization.
Once  acquisition  is  complete,  the  receiver  enters  a  steady-state  mode  of  operation,  where  concerns  such  as
symbol error rate, mean time to loss of lock, and reaction to fading and interference are of primary importance.
To  characterize  the  system,  the  user  may  wish  to  decouple  the  analysis  of  these  parameters  to  investigate
relationships that may exist.
