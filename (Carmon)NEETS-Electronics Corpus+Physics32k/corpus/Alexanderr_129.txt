and it requires only
four out of the ﬁve Eqs. (3.4.1) to (3.4.5) to ﬁnd them. Although the ﬁfth
equation  is  redundant,  it  can  be  used  to  check  results.  We  can  solve
Eqs.  (3.4.1)  to  (3.4.4)  directly  using  MATLAB.  We  can  eliminate  one
node voltage so that we solve three simultaneous equations instead of
four. From Eq. (3.4.3), 
Substituting this into Eqs. (3.4.1)
and (3.4.2), respectively, gives
