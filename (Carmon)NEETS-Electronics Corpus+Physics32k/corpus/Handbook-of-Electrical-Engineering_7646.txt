Detect/Emit Devices
Detect/emit devices are optoelectronic structures that detect the incoming signal, process the information, and
then transfer the information off the device through the use of active light emitters such as LEDs or lasers. An
example of a detect/emit device is the “thyristor-like” pnpn device as illustrated in Fig. 79.28(a). It is a digital
active optical logic device with “high” and “low” light-emitting optical output states corresponding to electrical
states of high impedance (low optical output) or low impedance (high optical output). The device can be driven
from one state to the other either electrically or optically. The optical output can be either a lasing output or
light-emitting  diode  output.  There  are  several  devices  that  are  based  on  this  general  structure.  The  double
heterostructure optoelectronic switch (DOES) is actually an npnp structure that is designed as an integrated
bipolar inversion channel heterojunction ﬁeld-effect transistor (BICFET) phototransistor controlling and driv-
ing either an LED or microlaser output. The second device is a pnpn structure referred to as a vertical-to-surface
transmission electrophotonic device (VSTEP).
