A magnetic nano, (often shortened to just 'nano'), is a small metal container, measuring a centimetre in height and width, with a screw-top lid and a thin, cylindrical magnet at its base. They often have an O-ring seal between the lid and the body to make them easier to open and partially waterproof.
