As you see in ChapterÂ 9, the voltage drop across an LED remains constant for 
a certain range of current passing through it, but if you try to pass too much 
current through the LED, it will burn out. For example, suppose your LED 
voltage is 2 V and the maximum current it can handle is 20 mA. What resis-
tance should you put in series with the LED to limit the current so it never 
exceeds 20 mA?
