By transferring matter, energy—including thermal energy—is moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another. This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is thermal hydraulics. This can be described by the formula:




Q
=
v
ρ

c

p


Δ
T


{\displaystyle Q=v\rho c_{p}\Delta T}

where Q is heat flux (W/m²), ρ is density (kg/m³),




c

p




{\displaystyle c_{p}}
is heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg·K), ΔT is the change in temperature (K),



v


{\displaystyle v}
is velocity (m/s).
