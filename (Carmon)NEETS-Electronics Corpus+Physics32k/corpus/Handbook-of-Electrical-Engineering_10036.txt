In this form, the vector x ∈ ᑬn represents the internal state, u ∈ ᑬp represents the input, and y ∈ ᑬq represents
the measured outputs. It is well known that if the system in Eq. (100.145) is stabilizable (i.e., its unstable part
is  controllable),  then  it  can  be  asymptotically  stabilized  with  static  state  feedback.  If  it  is  detectable  (i.e.,  its
unstable part is observable), then a state estimator can be found, whose state variables asymptotically approach
the true state variables in Eq. (100.145). However, merely determining the state feedback gain or observer gain
leaves considerable design freedom for satisfying criteria other than stabilization and asymptotic observation.
In  this  chapter  section,  we  will  provide  results  of  some  basic  techniques  of  optimal  control  and  estimation,
which  provide  a  mechanism  to  ﬁnd  optimal  feedback  and  observer  (estimator)  gains  according  to  selected
optimality criteria.
