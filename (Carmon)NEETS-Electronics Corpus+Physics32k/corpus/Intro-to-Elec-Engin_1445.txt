Demodulation of VSB signals generally uses a synchronous detector in the conÔ¨Åguration of
Figure 15.2.10. In VSB, a carrier component is generally transmitted along with the message
sidebands. The existence of the carrier component makes it possible to extract a phase-coherent
reference for demodulation in a balanced modulator. In some applications, such as television
broadcasting, however, a large carrier component is transmitted along with the message in the
VSB signal, and in such a case it is possible to recover the message by passing the received signal
through an envelope detector.
