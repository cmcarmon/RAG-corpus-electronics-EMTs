Magnetic recording is used for cassette recorders, 
video recorders, reel-to-reel recorders, floppy disk 
drives, and hard disk drives. All these devices use the 
same electromagnetic principle to store information. 
A signal is stored on the tape or disk with a record 
head, to be read back later with a playback head. In 
some equipment, the record and playback head are 
combined in one package or they may be the same 
head. The record and playback head are a coil of wire 
with a ferromagnetic core. In a tiny gap between the 
ends of the core is a magnetic field. As the storage 
medium, a piece of material covered with iron oxide, 
is pulled across the record head, the magnetic field 
penetrates the tape, magnetizing it. The informa-
tion is written on it in a magnetic pattern that cor-
responds to the original information. To play back 
or read the information, the medium is moved past 
the gap in the playback head. The changing magnetic
