The output waveform in this graph (eC) is the waveform that will be produced after many cycles of 
input signal to the integrator. The capacitor will charge and discharge in a step-by-step manner until it 
finally charges and discharges above and below a 50-volt level. The 50-volt level is controlled by the 
maximum amplitude of the symmetrical input pulse, the average value of which is 50 volts.
