You know that for proper commutation, the coil short-circuited by the brushes must be in the neutral 
plane. Consider the operation of a simple two-pole dc generator, shown in figure 1-8. View A of the 
figure shows the field poles and the main magnetic field. The armature is shown in a simplified view in 
views B and C with the cross section of its coil represented as little circles. The symbols within the circles 
represent arrows. The dot represents the point of the arrow coming toward you, and the cross represents 
the tail, or feathered end, going away from you. When the armature rotates clockwise, the sides of the coil 
to the left will have current flowing toward you, as indicated by the dot. The side of the coil to the right 
will have current flowing away from you, as indicated by the cross. The field generated around each side 
of the coil is shown in view B of figure 1-8. This field increases in strength for each wire in the armature 
coil, and sets up a magnetic field almost perpendicular to the main field.
