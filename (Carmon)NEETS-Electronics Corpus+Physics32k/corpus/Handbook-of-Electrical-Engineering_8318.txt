Synchronous versus Asynchronous Design Style. More than any other issue, discussions concerning synchro-
nous  versus  asynchronous  design  style  create  the  most  disagreements  concerning  design  for  testability.  Many
logic designers who are experienced in using SSI and MSI IC chips have adapted a design style where synchronous
(e.g., clocked) and asynchronous (e.g., self-timed) designs are freely mixed together. Using clocked ﬂip-ﬂops
