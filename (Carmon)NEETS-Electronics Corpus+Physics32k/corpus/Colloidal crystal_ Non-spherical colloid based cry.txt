Crystalline thin-films from non-spherical colloids were produced using convective assembly techniques. Colloid shapes included dumbbell, hemisphere, disc, and sphero-cylinder shapes. Both purely crystalline and plastic crystal phases could be produced, depending on the aspect ratio of the colloidal particle. The particles were crystallized both as 2D (i.e., monolayer) and 3D (i.e., multilayer) structures. The observed lattice and particle orientations experimentally confirmed a body of theoretical work on the condensed phases of non-spherical objects. Assembly of crystals from non-spherical colloids can also be directed via the use of electrical fields.
