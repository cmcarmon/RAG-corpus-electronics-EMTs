Hence the orbital period (

{\displaystyle T\,\!}
) can be computed as:

{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {r^{3} \over {\mu }}}}

Compare two proportional quantities, the free-fall time (time to fall to a point mass from rest)

{\displaystyle T_{ff}={\frac {\pi }{2{\sqrt {2}}}}{\sqrt {r^{3} \over {\mu }}}}
(17.7% of the orbital period in a circular orbit)
and the time to fall to a point mass in a radial parabolic orbit

The fact that the formulas only differ by a constant factor is a priori clear from dimensional analysis.
