commonly used for DIP packages. However, with less metal and shorter lead lengths to transfer heat to ambient
air, more heat is typically transferred to the circuit board itself. Several board thermal analysis software packages
are  available,  and  are  highly  recommended  for  boards  that  are  expected  to  develop  high  thermal  gradients
[Flotherm, 1995].
