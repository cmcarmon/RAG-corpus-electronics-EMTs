James Watt's parallel motion and Watt's linkage
Peaucellierâ€“Lipkin linkage, the first planar linkage to create a perfect straight line output from rotary input; eight-bar, one DOF.
A Scott Russell linkage, which converts linear motion, to (almost) linear motion in a line perpendicular to the input.
Chebyshev linkage, which provides nearly straight motion of a point with a four-bar linkage.
Hoekens linkage, which provides nearly straight motion of a point with a four-bar linkage.
Sarrus linkage, which provides motion of one surface in a direction normal to another.
Hart's inversor, which provides a perfect straight line motion without sliding guides.
