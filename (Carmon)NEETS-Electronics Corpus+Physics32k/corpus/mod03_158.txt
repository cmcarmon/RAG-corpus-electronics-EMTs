The two instruments most commonly used to check the continuity (a complete circuit), or to measure
the resistance of a circuit or circuit element, are the OHMMETER and the MEGGER (megohm meter).
The ohmmeter is widely used to measure resistance and check the continuity of electrical circuits and
devices. Its range usually extends to only a few megohms. The megger is widely used for measuring
insulation resistance, such as between a wire and the outer surface of the insulation, and insulation
resistance of cables and insulators. The range of a megger may extend to more than 1,000 megohms.
