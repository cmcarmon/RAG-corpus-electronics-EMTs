In the general case of rotation of an unsymmetric body, which has different values of the moment of inertia about the three principal axes, the rotational motion can be quite complex unless the body is rotating around the axis of maximum moment of inertia (stable rotation) or the axis of minimum moment of inertia (unstable rotation), described in the tennis racket theorem. The motion is simplified in the case of an axisymmetric body, in which the moment of inertia is the same about two of the principal axes. These cases include rotation of an prolate spheroid (the shape of an American football), or rotation of an oblate spheroid (the shape of a pancake). In this case, the angular velocity describes a cone, and the polhode is a circle. This analysis is applicable, for example, to the axial precession of the rotation of a planet (the case of an oblate spheroid.)
Two moons of Pluto and many other small bodies of the Solar System have tumbling rotations.
The physics of a rattleback rotation is another example.
