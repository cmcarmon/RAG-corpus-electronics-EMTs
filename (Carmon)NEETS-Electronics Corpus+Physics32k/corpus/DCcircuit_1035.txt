The advantage in performing the “Thevenin conversion” to the simpler circuit, of course,
is that it makes load voltage and load current so much easier to solve than in the original
network. Calculating the equivalent Thevenin source voltage and series resistance is actually
quite easy. First, the chosen load resistor is removed from the original circuit, replaced with a
