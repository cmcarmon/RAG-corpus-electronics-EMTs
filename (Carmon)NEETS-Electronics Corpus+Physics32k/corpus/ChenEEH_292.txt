Supply and ground rails are designed to have minimal resist-
ance to alleviate such effects as series resistance. This is accom-
plished by using low resistivity materials, increasing the cross-
sectional area of the conductors, using shorter interconnection
lengths, and applying other techniques. Two conditions, how-
ever, may still produce large voltage deviations. One condition
is high-current I/O buffers, and the second condition is simul-
taneous switching of many parallel gates. The latter situation is
illustrated in Figure 2.6(C).
