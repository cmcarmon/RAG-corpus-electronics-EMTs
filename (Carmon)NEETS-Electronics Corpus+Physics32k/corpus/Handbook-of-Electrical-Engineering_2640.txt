As devices are miniaturized, ro is decreased, gD increased, due to several factors. At moderate drain biases,
the main factor is channel-length modulation, the reduction of the channel length with increasing drain voltage
that results when the depletion region around the drain expands toward the source, causing L to become drain-
bias  dependent. At  larger  drain  biases,  a  second  factor  is  drain  control  of  the  inversion-layer  charge  density,
which can compete with gate control in short devices. This is the same mechanism discussed later in the context
of subthreshold behavior. At rather high drain bias, carrier multiplication further lowers ro.
