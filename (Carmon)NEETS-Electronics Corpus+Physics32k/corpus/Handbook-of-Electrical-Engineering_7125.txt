Figure 74.5  illustrates  the  elements  of  the  radio  frequency  (RF)  link  between  a  satellite  and  earth  terminals.
The  overall  link  performance  is  determined  by  computing  the  link  equation  for  the  uplink  and  downlink
separately and then combining the results along with interference and intermodulation effects.
