This result generalizes to include sources in a very interesting and useful way. Let’s consider our simple
attenuator circuit (shown in Figure 3.15) from the viewpoint of the output terminals. We want to ﬁnd
the v-i relation for the output terminal pair, and then ﬁnd the equivalent circuit for the boxed circuit. To
perform this calculation, use the circuit laws and element relations, but do not attach anything to the output
terminals. We seek the relation between v and i that describes the kind of element that lurks within the
dashed box. The result is
