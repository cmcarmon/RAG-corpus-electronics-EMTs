On the other hand, the critical frequency of the sporadic E is very high and can be greater than 
double the critical frequency of the normal ionospheric layers. This condition may permit the long 
distance transmission of signals at unusually high frequencies. It may also permit short distance 
communications to locations that would normally be in the skip zone.
