The smaller packages generally house signal transistors, which are rated to 
handle smaller currents. Larger packages contain power transistors, which 
are designed to handle larger currents. Most signal transistors come in 
plastic cases, but some precision applications require signal transistors 
housed in metal cases to reduce the likelihood of stray radio‚Äêfrequency (RF) 
interference.
