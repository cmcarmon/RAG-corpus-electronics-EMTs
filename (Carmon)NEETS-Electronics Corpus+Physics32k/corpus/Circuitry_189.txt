Periodic time 
 
The periodic time (or period) of a waveform is the 
time taken for one complete cycle of the wave (see 
Fig.  4.3).  The  relationship  between  periodic  time 
and frequency is thus: 
 
t = 1 / f or  f = 1 / t
where  t is  the  periodic  time  (in  s)  and  f is  the 
frequency (in Hz). 
 
Example 4.2 
 
A waveform has a frequency of 400 Hz. What is 
the periodic time of the waveform? 
 
Solution 
 
t = 1 / f = 1/400 = 0.0025 s (or 2.5 ms)
