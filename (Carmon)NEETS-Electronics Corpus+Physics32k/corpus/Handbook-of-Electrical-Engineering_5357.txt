Emerging  from  the  development  of  lower-bandgap  III-V  cells  is  the  resurgent  thermophotovoltaic  (TPV)
technology [Coutts and Ward, 1998]. These are photovoltaic devices designed to work with infrared or thermal
sources rather than sunlight. Early considerations of this technology used semiconductors with bandgaps in
the range of 0.9 to 1.1 eV (primarily Ge and Si), that are matched to black-body temperatures above 2000K,
which  is  difÔ¨Åcult  to  engineer  real  systems.  The  development  of  devices  in  the  0.5  eV  range  correspond  to
temperatures of approximately 1500K, more suitable for system realization.
