The purpose of an ohmmeter, of course, is to measure the resistance placed between its
leads. This resistance reading is indicated through a mechanical meter movement which oper-
ates on electric current. The ohmmeter must then have an internal source of voltage to create
the necessary current to operate the movement, and also have appropriate ranging resistors to
allow just the right amount of current through the movement at any given resistance.
