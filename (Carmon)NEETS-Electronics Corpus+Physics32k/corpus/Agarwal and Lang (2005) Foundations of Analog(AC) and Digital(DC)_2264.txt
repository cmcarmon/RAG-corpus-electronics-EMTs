Now the waveforms can be sketched. Assuming that the capacitor is ini-
tially uncharged and the input voltage goes positive to +10 V on the first
half cycle, as suggested in Figure 16.14, then the initial circuit state is the OFF
state, from Equation 16.29. Hence the capacitor will charge toward +10 volts.
Here Vinit = 0, and Vfinal = 10, so
vC = 10
