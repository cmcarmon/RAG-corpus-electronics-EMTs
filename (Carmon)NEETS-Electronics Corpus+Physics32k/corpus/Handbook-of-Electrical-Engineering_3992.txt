Transferred Electron Devices
Transferred electron devices (i.e., Gunn diodes) [Bosch and Engelmann, 1975] also have N-type active char-
acteristics  and  can  be  modeled  as  a  negative  conductance  in  parallel  with  a  capacitance.  Device  operation,
however, is based upon a fundamentally different principle. The negative conductance derives from the complex
conduction band structure of certain compound semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP. In these direct bandgap
materials the central (or G) conduction band is in close energy-momentum proximity to secondary, higher-
order conduction bands (i.e., the X and L valleys). The electron effective mass is determined by the shape of
the conduction bands, and the effective mass is “light” in the G valley but “heavy” in the higher-order X and
L valleys. When the crystal is biased, current ﬂow is initially due to electrons in the light effective mass G valley
and conduction is ohmic. However, as the bias ﬁeld is increased, an increasing proportion of the free electrons
are transferred into the X and L valleys where the electrons have heavier effective mass. The increased effective
mass slows down the electrons, with a corresponding decrease in conduction current through the crystal. The
net result is that the crystal displays a region of applied bias voltages where current decreases with increasing
voltage. That is, a negative conductance is generated. The device is unstable and, when placed in an RF circuit
