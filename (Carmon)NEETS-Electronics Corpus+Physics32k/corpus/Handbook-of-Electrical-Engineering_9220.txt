The Origins and Causes of Software Defects
Before software defects can be prevented or removed effectively, it is necessary to know where defects originate
and what causes them. There are ﬁve primary origin points for software defects and three primary causes. The
ﬁve primary origin points are (1) requirements, (2) design, (3) code, (4) user documentation, and (5) bad ﬁxes,
or secondary defects that occur while attempting to repair a primary defect. The three primary causes of software
defects are (1) errors of omission, (2) errors of commission, and (3) errors of clarity or ambiguity. Table 90.1
shows the interaction of software defect origins and defect types.
