From Example 7.3, the voltage drop across the drift region at
a current density of 100 ËšA=cm2 is 3.1 V. With technological
limitations and following the design guidelines, the unit cell
dimension of a 500 V MOSFET is about 8 mm. Then, consider-
ing that the channel has an on-state resistance of 0:68 V
(example 7.4), the channel drop is 0.35 V. Thus, the overall
MOSFET voltage drop is 3.45 V. The IGBT will have the same
channel drop. However, the voltage across the diode in the
equivalent representation of the IGBT is given by equation 7.19
to be 0.43 V. Thus, the overall voltage-drop of the IGBT is
0.78 V. This illustrates the superior on-state performance of
IGBTs over MOSFETs at higher voltage levels.
