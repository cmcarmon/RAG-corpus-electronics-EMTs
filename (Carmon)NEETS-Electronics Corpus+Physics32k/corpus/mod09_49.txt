In an a.c. circuit, an inductor produces inductive reactance which causes the current to lag the 
voltage by 90 degrees. Because the inductor "reacts" to a changing current, it is known as a reactive 
component. The opposition that an inductor presents to a.c. is called inductive reactance (X L). This 
opposition is caused by the inductor "reacting" to the changing current of the a.c. source. Both the 
inductance and the frequency determine the magnitude of this reactance. This relationship is stated by the 
formula:
