The Stewart platform design is extensively used in flight simulation, particularly in the so-called full flight simulator for which all 6 degrees of freedom are required. This application was developed by Redifon, whose simulators featuring it became available for the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle, Canadair CL-44, Boeing 727, Comet, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Vanguard, Convair CV 990, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Vickers VC10, and Fokker F-27 by 1962.
In this role, the payload is a replica cockpit and a visual display system, normally of several channels, for showing the outside-world visual scene to the aircraft crew that are being trained. Payload weights in the case of a full flight simulator for a large transport aircraft can be up to about 15,000 kilogrammes.
Similar platforms are used in driving simulators, typically mounted on large x-y tables to simulate short term acceleration. Long term acceleration can be simulated by tilting the platform, and an active research area is how to mix the two.
