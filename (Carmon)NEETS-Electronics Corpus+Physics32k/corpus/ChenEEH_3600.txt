mented by using an FIR ﬁlter. The denominator entails the use
of a recursive structure. The cascade of these realizations for
the numerator and denominator is shown in Figure 2.11. If the
recursive part is implemented ﬁrst, the realization in Figure
2.11 can be transformed into the structure in Figure 2.12 for
the case N ¼ M. The transpose of the structure in Figure 2.12
is shown in Figure 2.13.
