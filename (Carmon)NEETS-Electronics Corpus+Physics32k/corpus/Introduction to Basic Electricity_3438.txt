resistance. Capacitors require more space than resis-
tors and also increase in size as their capacity increases.
Integrated circuits cannot be repaired. This is 
 because the internal components cannot be  separated. 
Therefore, problems are identified by  individual 
 circuit instead of by individual component. The 
 advantage  of  this  disadvantage  is  that  it  greatly 
 simplifies  maintaining highly complex systems. It also 
reduces the amount of time required for maintenance 
 personnel to service equipment.
