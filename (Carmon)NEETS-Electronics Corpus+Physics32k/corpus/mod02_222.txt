dielectric material to become ionized, arcing between the plates will occur. In most other types of capacitors,
arcing will destroy the capacitor. However, an electrolytic capacitor has the ability to be self-healing. If the
arcing is small, the electrolytic will regenerate itself. If the arcing is too large, the capacitor will not self-heal
and will become defective.
