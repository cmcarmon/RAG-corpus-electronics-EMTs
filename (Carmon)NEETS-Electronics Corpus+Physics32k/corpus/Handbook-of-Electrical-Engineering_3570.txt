During normal device operation, the scan rings are disabled and the registers serve as conventional memory
(state) storage elements. During test operation, the scan rings are enabled and stimulus test vectors are shifted
into the memory elements to set the state of the digital system. The digital system is exercised for one clock
cycle and then the results are shifted out of the scan ring to record the response.
