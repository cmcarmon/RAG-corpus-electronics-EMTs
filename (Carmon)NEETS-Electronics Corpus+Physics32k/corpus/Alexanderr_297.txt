is the length, A is the cross-sectional
where N is the number of turns, 
area, and 
is the permeability of the core. We can see from Eq. (6.19)
that inductance can be increased by increasing the number of turns of
coil, using material with higher permeability as the core, increasing the
cross-sectional area, or reducing the length of the coil.
