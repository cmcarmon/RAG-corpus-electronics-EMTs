Following the result of part (a), determine IL in terms of RB, RN, VN, VS, K, and VT.
b)
c) Now assume that vs (cid:11)= 0. Draw a small-signal circuit model for the combined circuit
comprising the power supply, current source and load, with which il can be found
from vs. Clearly label the value of each component in the circuit model.
