A 4-bit register stores 4 bits, referred to as a nibble;  
an 8-bit register stores 8 bits, called a byte; and a 
larger register stores a word. Typical word sizes are 
16, 32, 64, and 128 bits. Registers with 4, 8, and 16 bits 
are shown in Figure 44-29. By looking at the Q output, 
the status of the data stored can be checked in any of 
these registers. The complementary data are also avail-
able by looking at the Q output.
