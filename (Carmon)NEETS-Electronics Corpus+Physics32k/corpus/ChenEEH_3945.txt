A decision rule characterized by the likelihood ratio and a
threshold as in equation 6.44 is referred to as a likelihood
ratio test (LRT). A Bayes’ detection scheme is always an LRT.
Depending on how the a posteriori probabilities of the two
hypotheses are deﬁned, the Bayes’ detector can be realized in
different ways. One typical example is the so-called MAP de-
tector that renders the minimum probability of error by choos-
ing the hypothesis with the maximum a posteriori probability.
Another class of detectors is the minimax detectors, which can
be considered an extension of Bayes’ detectors. The minimax
detector is also an LRT. It assumes no knowledge of the prior
probabilities (i.e., p0 and p1) and selects the threshold by
choosing the prior probability that renders the maximum
Bayes’ risk. The minimax detector is a robust detector because
its performance does not vary with the prior probabilities.
