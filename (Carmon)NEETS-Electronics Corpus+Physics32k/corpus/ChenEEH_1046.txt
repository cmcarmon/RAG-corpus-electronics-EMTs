encoding techniques is that the required number of extra bus
lines increases exponentially as the transition activity is re-
duced. An alternative is to keep the number of bus lines
constant and inject redundancy in time by using extra transfer
cycles. In the deep-submicron era, interconnect wires (more
speciﬁcally global wires, such as buses and clock signals) and
the associated driver and receiver circuits are responsible for a
large fraction of the energy consumption of an integrated
circuit (Zhang and Rabaey, 1998). The low-swing signaling
technique is used for information transfers on long wires
where wires achieve low-power consumption as they assume
reduced voltage swings on the transmitted signals. Such tech-
nique requires special transmitter and receiver circuits to pro-
vide and sense the low swing voltages on signals ﬂowing in
these busses; normal circuits cannot detect these low swing
circuits correctly. Examples of these interfacing circuits can be
found in (Nakagome et al., 1993; Burd, 1998; Colshan and
Jaroun, 1994; Hiraki et al., 1995).
