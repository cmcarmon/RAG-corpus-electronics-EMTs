Another  source  of  peak  broadening  is  the  variation  in  the  small  amount  of  particle  energy  lost  during
Rutherford scattering. This energy is transmitted directly to the scattering nuclei and does not generate electron-
hole pairs, and a small pulse deÔ¨Åcit results. These events are relatively few but large, and therefore contribute
disproportionately to peak variance. The FWHM contribution of this effect on a 6-MeV alpha particle peak
has been estimated to be 3.5 KeV [26].
