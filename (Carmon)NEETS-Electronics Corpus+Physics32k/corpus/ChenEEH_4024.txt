4. Intermediate representation generation (IR): An IR is
generated from a given SFG with the help of a prede-
signed component library. The bit width of each vari-
able is used to determine the size of register and bus.
The Ô¨Ånal result is usually in HDL behavioral descrip-
tion for further behavioral-to-register transfer HDL
synthesis.
