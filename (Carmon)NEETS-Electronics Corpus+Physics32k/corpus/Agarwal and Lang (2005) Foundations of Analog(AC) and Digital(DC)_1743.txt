In the next two sections, we combine the results of the previous sections and
study the behavior of second-order circuits that have both damping and an
external input. In this section, we study the series circuit obtained by including
a series voltage source in Figure 12.15. The next section studies the parallel
circuit obtained by including a parallel current source in W W W Figure 12.24.
Through the use of Th√©venin and Norton equivalence, the results actually apply
to many other circuits as well.
