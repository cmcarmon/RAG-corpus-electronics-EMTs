All three adhere to the form of Eq. (86.16) and are, therefore, legitimate ﬂoating-point numbers in radix 10.
Thus, as the radix point ﬂoats to the left, the exponent is scaled accordingly. The ﬁrst form for h is said to be
normalized because the MSD of  F is nonzero, a means of standardizing the radix point position. Notice that
the sign for F is positive while that for  E is negative.
