Just as the RC time constant in RC circuits (which you can read about in 
ChapterÂ 7) gives you an idea of how long it takes a capacitor to charge to 
its full capacity, so the RL time constant helps you figure out how long it 
will take for an inductor to fully conduct a DC current: Direct current settles 
down to a steady value after roughly five RL time constants.
