The gain of an op-amp varies with frequency. Typi-
cally, the gain given by a specification sheet is the DC 
gain. As the frequency increases, the gain decreases. 
Without some means to increase the bandwidth, the 
op-amp is only good for amplifying a DC signal. To 
increase the bandwidth, feedback is used to reduce the 
gain. By reducing the gain, the bandwidth increases by 
the same amount. In this way, the 741 op-amp band-
width can be increased to 1 megahertz.
