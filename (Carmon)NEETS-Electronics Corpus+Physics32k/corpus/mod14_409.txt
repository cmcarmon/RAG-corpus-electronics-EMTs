A negative-going pulse is applied to all PS terminals to start the countdown. This causes all the FFs
to set and also lights indicators A, B, and C. The beginning count is 1112 (710). At the same time, LOWs
are applied to the CLK inputs of FF2 and FF3, but they do not toggle because the PS overrides any
change. All actions in the counter will take place on the negative-going portion of the input pulse. Letâ€™s go
through the pulse sequences in figure 3-27, view B.
