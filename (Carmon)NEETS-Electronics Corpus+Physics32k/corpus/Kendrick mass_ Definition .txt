According to the procedure outlined by Kendrick, the mass of CH2 is defined as exactly 14 Da, instead of the IUPAC mass of 14.01565 Da.
To convert an IUPAC mass of a particular compound to the Kendrick mass, the equation






Kendrick~mass


=


IUPAC~mass


×


14.00000
14.01565




{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass}}={\textrm {IUPAC~mass}}\times {\frac {14.00000}{14.01565}}}

is used. The mass in dalton units (Da) can be converted to the Kendrick scale by dividing by 1.0011178.
Other groups of atoms in addition to CH2 can be used define the Kendrick mass, for example CO2, H2, H2O, and O. In this case, the Kendrick mass for a family of compounds F is given by






Kendrick~mass~(F)


=


(observed~mass)


×



nominal~mass~F


exact~mass~F





{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass~(F)}}={\textrm {(observed~mass)}}\times {\frac {\textrm {nominal~mass~F}}{\textrm {exact~mass~F}}}}
.
For the hydrocarbon analysis, F=CH2.
As an example, Kendrick analysis has been used for visualizing families of halogenated compounds of environmental interest that differ only by the number of chlorine, bromine or fluorine substitutions.
A recent publication has suggested that Kendrick mass be expressed in Kendrick units with symbol Ke.
