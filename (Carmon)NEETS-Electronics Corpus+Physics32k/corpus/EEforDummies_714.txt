To determine which pin is which, you look down on the top of the IC (not 
up at the little critter’s underbelly) for the clocking mark, which is usually a 
small notch in the packaging but might instead be a little dimple or a white 
or colored stripe. (Some ICs have multiple marks.) By convention, the pins 
on an IC are numbered counterclockwise, starting with the upper‐left pin 
closest to the clocking mark. So, for example, with the clocking notch orient-
ing the chip at the 12 o’clock position, the pins of a 14‐pin IC are numbered 1 
through 7 down the left side and 8 through 14 up the right side, as shown in 
Figure 11-7.
