(a) What is the minimum sampling rate for this signal suggested by the Sampling Theorem?
(b) Because of the particular structure of this spectrum, one wonders whether a lower sampling rate could
be used. Show that this is indeed the case, and Ô¨Ånd the system that reconstructs s (t) from its samples.
