The strain versus the electric phenomenon perceived in piezoelectric materials is dictated by a coefﬁcient
that has components referred to a set of orthogonal coordinate axes (which are correlated to standard crystal-
lographic axes). For example, denoting the piezoelectric coefﬁcient (ratio between piezoelectric strain compo-
n
nent to applied electric ﬁeld component at a constant mechanical stress or vice versa) as 
  =  1  to  6  speciﬁes  the  mechanical  stress-strain
(1  to  3)  refers  to  the  three  euclidian  orthogonal  axes,  and 
components. The unit for
