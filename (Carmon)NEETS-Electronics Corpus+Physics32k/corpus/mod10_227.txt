Let's look at a half-wave antenna to illustrate how this radiation actually takes place. Simply stated, a 
half-wave antenna is one that has an electrical length equal to half the wavelength of the signal being 
transmitted. Assume, for example, that a transmitter is operating at 30 megahertz. If a half-wave antenna 
is used with the transmitter, the antenna's electrical length would have to be at least 16 feet long. (The 
formula used to compute the electrical length of an antenna will be explained in chapter 4.) When power 
is delivered to the half-wave antenna, both an induction field and a radiation field are set up by the 
fluctuating energy. At the antenna, the intensities of these fields are proportional to the amount of power 
delivered to the antenna from a source such as a transmitter. At a short distance from the antenna and 
beyond, only the radiation field exists. This radiation field is made up of an electric component and a 
magnetic component at right angles to each other in space and varying together in intensity.
