Since the introduction of ethernet more than a dozen years ago, desktop computer capabilities and network-
ing  requirements  have  increased  signiﬁcantly.  To  meet  these  demands  a  100-Mb/s  (fast)  ethernet  has  been
developed by a consortium of companies. This will be standardized within IEEE 802.3. Media options for the
100-Mb/s ethernet include shielded or unshielded twisted pair as well as ﬁber optics. Wiring distances of up
to 100 m between an end system and wiring closet can be supported. Adapters as well as repeaters that can
operate at either 10 or 100 Mb/s will be available. In 1994 there were 50 million ethernet nodes with 15 million
new nodes being added each year.
