The role of synchronization in chaotic digital modulation is explored in [4,6]. These papers also describe
the state of the art in noncoherent receivers for chaotic digital communications. FM-DCSK is developed in [13].
Advances  in  the  theory  and  practice  of  chaotic  communications  in  electrical  engineering  are  reported  in
Electronics Letters, the IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems, and the IEEE Transactions on Communications.
This section has focused exclusively on chaotic modulation techniques. Other applications of chaotic signals
and  synchronization  schemes  have  been  proposed  but  they  are  less  close  to  practice:  discrete-time  chaotic
sequences for spread spectrum systems were introduced in [14]; synchronization techniques for chaotic systems,
