The display observed on a cathode-ray oscilloscope is ordinarily one similar to those shown in figure
2-13. Views A and B show the instantaneous voltage of the wave plotted against time. Elapsed time (view
A) is indicated by horizontal distance, from left to right, across the etched grid (graticule) placed over the
face of the tube. The amplitude (view B) of the wave is measured vertically on the graph.
