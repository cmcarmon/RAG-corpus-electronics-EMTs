Automatic degaussers erase magnetic tape by automatically moving the whole tape reel or cartridge
slowly and steadily in and out of an intense ac magnetic field. This type of degausser erases a tape very
well. Some automatic degaussers are made specifically for tape reels, and some are made for both tape
reels and tape cartridges. Figure 2-7 shows a typical automatic degausser.
