It is important to understand that the mathematical basis for incremental analysis and
for the formation of the two subcircuits, as in Figure 4.44, is not superposition, but a
particular interpretation of a Taylor series expansion. Even though we keep only the
first two terms of the series, as in Equation 4.61, the relationship is still nonlinear, and
hence superposition cannot apply.
