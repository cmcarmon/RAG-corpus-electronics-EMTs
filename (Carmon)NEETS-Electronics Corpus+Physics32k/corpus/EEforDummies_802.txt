Buying a recharger and a supply of rechargeable batteries can save you a 
considerable amount of money over time. Just make absolutely sure the bat-
tery charger you use is designed for the type of rechargeable battery you 
select. Check both the chemistry (for instance, Li‚Äêion or NiMH) and the volt-
age of the battery when selecting a charger.
