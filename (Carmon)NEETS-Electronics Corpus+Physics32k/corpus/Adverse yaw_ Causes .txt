Adverse yaw is a secondary effect of the inclination of the lift vectors on the wing due to its rolling velocity and of the application of the ailerons. Some pilot training manuals focus mainly on the additional drag caused by the downward-deflected aileron and make only brief or indirect mentions of roll effects. In fact the rolling of the wings usually causes a greater effect than the ailerons. Assuming a roll rate to the right, as in the diagram, the causes are explained as follows:
