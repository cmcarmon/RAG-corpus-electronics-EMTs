Extended IDE (EIDE) also called ATA-2, drives were later
introduced to solve the problem by supporting a second ad-
dressing scheme called logical block addressing (LBA) mode. It
allows numbering sectors from 0 to 2^24â€“1 and, consequently,
gets beyond the 528-MB limit. The IDE can also control four
drives instead of two, has a higher transfer rate, and has the
ability to control CD-ROM drives.
