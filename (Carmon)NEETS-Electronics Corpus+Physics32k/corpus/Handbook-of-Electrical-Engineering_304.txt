The Network Theorems of Thévenin and Norton
If interest is to be focused on the voltages and across the currents through a small portion of a network such
as network B in Fig. 3.13(a), it is convenient to replace network A, which is complicated and of little interest,
by a simple equivalent. The simple equivalent may contain a single, equivalent, voltage source in series with
an equivalent impedance in series as displayed in Fig. 3.13(b). In this case, the equivalent is called a Thévenin
equivalent. Alternatively, the simple equivalent may consist of an equivalent current source in parallel with an
equivalent  impedance.  This  equivalent,  shown  in  Fig.  3.13(c),  is  called  a  Norton  equivalent.  Observe  that  as
long  as  ZT  (subscript  T  for  Thévenin)  is  equal  to  ZN  (subscript  N  for  Norton),  the  two  equivalents  may  be
obtained from one another by a simple source transformation.
