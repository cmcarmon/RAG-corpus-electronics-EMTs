Reactive power: Consider  an  ac  source  connected  at  a  pair  of  terminals  to  an  otherwise  isolated  network.
The reactive power is a measure of the energy exchanged between the source and the network without
being dissipated in the network. The reactive power delivered would be expressed as Q = *V* Â· *I* sin(q).
Real power: Consider an ac source connected at a pair of terminals to an otherwise isolated network. The
