Many physical processes are affected by temperature, such as
physical properties of materials including the phase (solid, liquid, gaseous or plasma), density, solubility, vapor pressure, electrical conductivity
rate and extent to which chemical reactions occur
the amount and properties of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of an object
speed of sound is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature
