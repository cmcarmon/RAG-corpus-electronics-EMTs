Although these tubes are able to accurately register small voltages, they are bulky and
require electrical power to operate (unlike electromagnetic meter movements, which are more
compact and actuated by the power of the measured signal current going through them). They
are also much more fragile than other types of electrical metering devices. Usually, cathode
ray tubes are used in conjunction with precise external circuits to form a larger piece of test
equipment known as an oscilloscope, which has the ability to display a graph of voltage over
time, a tremendously useful tool for certain types of circuits where voltage and/or current levels
are dynamically changing.
