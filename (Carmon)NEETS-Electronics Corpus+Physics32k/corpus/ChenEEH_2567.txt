Resonant frequencies and mode proﬁles can be obtained
through the solution of Maxwell’s satisfying the metallic bound-
ary conditions. The current distribution over the surface of the
cavity depends on the proﬁle of magnetic ﬁelds that are in turn
determined by a particular mode. Generally, the existence of a
mode also depends on the excitation mechanism, such as the
shape of aperture or probe. Consequently, the power dissipation
is expected to be different from mode to mode, leading to
different Q values. In practice, the selection of an adequate
resonant mode is of critical importance for high-Q operation.
Figure 7.26 illustrates three basic types of cavity resonators: a
rectangular cavity of height b, width a, and length d; a cylin-
drical cavity of length d with radius a; and a coaxial line cavity
of length d with an inner and outer radius denoted by a and b.
The coaxial cavity resonator operators in the TEM mode, which
is much easier to control than other (waveguide) modes. For
simplicity, the coaxial line cavity will not be discussed because
its information can be found widely in the literature.
