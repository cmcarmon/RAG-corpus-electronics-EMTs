A lightcraft is a space- or air-vehicle driven by laser propulsion. Laser propulsion is in early stages of development. Lightcraft uses an external source of laser or maser energy to provide power for producing thrust. The laser/maser energy is focused to a high intensity in order to create a plasma. The plasma expands, producing thrust.
A lightcraft is distinct from a solar sail because it is dependent on the expansion of reaction mass to accelerate rather than being accelerated by light pressure alone.
