Capacitance is measured in terms of a two-element equivalent circuit consisting of a capacitor in
series with a resistor. The internal ac generator and detector of the model 250DE bridge are tuned to 1
kilohertz. Other frequencies can be used, but an external generator and detector are required. The D and Q
ranges of the bridge can be extended by use of an external rheostat connected to the terminals provided.
The measured capacitance is the product of the L-R-C dial setting times the setting of the RANGE switch.
Using the following steps, you can make a standard capacitance measurement:
