Example 13.5 
 
A VHF Band II FM receiver  with a 10.7 MHz IF 
covers the signal frequency range, 88 MHz to 108 
MHz. Over what frequency range should the local 
oscillator be tuned? 
 
Solution 
 
Using    fLO  =  fRF  +  fIF    when  fRF  =  88  MHz  gives  
 fLO = 88 MHz + 10.7 MHz = 98.7 MHz 
 
Using    fLO  =  fRF  +  fIF    when  fRF  =  108  MHz  gives   
fLO = 108 MHz + 10.7 MHz = 118.7 MHz 
The local oscillator tuning range should therefore 
be from 98.7 MHz to 118.7 MHz.
