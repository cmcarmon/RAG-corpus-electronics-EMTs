The cuboctahedron structure of the OSA-UCS color solid can be geometrically divided into 9 planes, known as cleavage planes. These 9 cleavage planes are defined as:
L - A plane of constant L (lightness) that runs perpendicular to the L axis, where j and g can take on any values.
j - A plane of constant j (yellow-blueness) that runs perpendicular to the j axis, where L and g can take on any values.
g - A plane of constant g (red-greenness) that runs perpendicular to the g axis, where L and j can take on any values.
L+j - A plane of constant L+j that runs parallel to the g axis, at 35° from the L axis and 55° from the j axis.
L−j - A plane of constant L-j that runs parallel to the g axis, at 35° from the L axis and 55° from the j axis.
L+g - A plane of constant L+g that runs parallel to the j axis, at 35° from the L axis and 55° from the g axis.
L−g - A plane of constant L-g that runs parallel to the g axis, at 35° from the L axis and 55° from the g axis.
j+g - A plane of constant j+g that runs parallel to the L axis, at 45° from the j and g axes.
j−g - A plane of constant j-g that runs parallel to the L axis, at 45° from the j and g axes.
