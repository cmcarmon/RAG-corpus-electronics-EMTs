Common-Source (CS) JFET Ampliﬁer
Figure 8.4.1(a) shows a CS JFET ampliﬁer in which resistors R1, R2, RD, and RSS are selected
by the bias design, and capacitors CG, CD, and CS are chosen to be large enough that they act as
short circuits at the lowest frequency of interest in the input signal vS. Figure 8.4.1(b) gives its
small-signal equivalent circuit. Noting that the input impedance of a JFET is very large, we have
