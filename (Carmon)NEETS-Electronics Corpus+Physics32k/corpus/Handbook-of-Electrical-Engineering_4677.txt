In  addition  to  generating  a  SAW,  other  spurious  acoustic  modes  may  be  generated.  Bulk  acoustic  waves
(BAW) may be both generated and received, which causes passband distortion and loss of out-of-band rejection.
BAW generation is minimized by proper choice of material, roughening of the crystal backside to scatter BAWs,
and use of a SAW track changer, such as a multistrip coupler.
