U-Th dating yields most accurate results if applied to precipitated calcium carbonate, that is in stalagmites, travertines, and lacustrine limestones. Bone and shell are less reliable. Mass spectrometry can achieve a precision of ±1%. Conventional alpha counting¨s precision is ±5%. Mass spectrometry also uses smaller samples.
