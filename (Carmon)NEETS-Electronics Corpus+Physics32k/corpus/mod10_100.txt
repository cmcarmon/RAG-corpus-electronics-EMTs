As an illustration of what happens if one of these three elements is not present, let’s refer to our
experiment in which a bell was placed in a jar containing a vacuum. You could see the bell being struck,
but you could hear no sound because there was no medium to transmit sound from the bell to you. Now
let’s look at another example in which the third element, the detector, is missing. You see a source (such
as an explosion) apparently producing a sound, and you know the medium (air) is present, but you are too
far away to hear the noise. Thus, as far as you are concerned, there is no detector and, therefore, no sound.
We must assume, then, that sound can exist only when a source transmits sound through a medium, which
passes it to a detector. Therefore, in the absence of any one of the basic elements (source, medium,
detector) there can be NO sound.
