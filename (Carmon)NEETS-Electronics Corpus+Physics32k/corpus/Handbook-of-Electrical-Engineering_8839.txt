Abstract data type: One or more sets of computational objects together with some basic operations on those
objects. One of these sets is deÔ¨Åned by the type either by enumeration or by generating operations and
is called the carrier set of the type. Customarily it is given the same name as the type. All other sets are
called auxiliary sets of the type. In exceptional cases a type may have more than one carrier set.
