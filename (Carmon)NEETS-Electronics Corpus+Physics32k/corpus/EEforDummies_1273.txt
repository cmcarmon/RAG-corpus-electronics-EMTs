Maybe you may know some kids who would love to have a traffic signal to 
use while they’re playing with toy cars and trucks, riding their Big Wheels 
in your driveway, or playing “Red Light, Green Light, 1‐2‐3!” with a bunch of 
friends. You can test the circuit on a solderless breadboard, tweak the design 
to suit the needs of your young customers, and then build a permanent 
circuit and enclose it in a shiny box that has three holes for the LEDs and a 
hook or stand for mounting. (If you do create such a project, remember to 
include an on/off switch for your battery.)
