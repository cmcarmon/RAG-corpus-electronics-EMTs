Drawings can easily be numbered according to SFI, and complex drawings in CAD systems may be split into layers to show individual installations according to the SFI Group System.
Drawing identification may incorporate a SFI Group System number. A standard drawing number may be composed as follows:
179-731-001 Ship no. – SFI tertiary group no. – Consecutive no.
Drawings should be numbered according to the group level if possible. The Primary and Secondary Group levels are usually used for system and arrangement drawings:
179-100-000: General arrangement
179-200-001: Profile and deck plan
179-350-000: Loading and discharging system
179-446-001: Engine stores arrangement
Item lists on arrangement drawings may also be coded according to the SFI Group System.
