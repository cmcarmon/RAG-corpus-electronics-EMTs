RECORDâ€”A group of related fields, all pertaining to the same subject; a person, a thing, or an 
event. For example, your payroll record (LES statement) might include fields for your name, amount 
paid, taxes withheld, earned leave, and any allotments you might have. On the other hand, a supply 
inventory record might consist of fields containing stock number, the name of the item, its unit price, the 
quantity on hand, and its bin location.
