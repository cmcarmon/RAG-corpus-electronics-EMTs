increase in the oscillating frequency, and an increase in emitter voltage causes a decrease in the 
oscillating frequency. This is a result of the change in capacitance between the junctions of the transistor. 
However, a common bias source does not completely compensate since the effects on other circuit 
parameters of each bias voltage differ.
