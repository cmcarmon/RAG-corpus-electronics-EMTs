Table 1.2 compares the four-module interleaved QSW
VRM design with the conventional VRM. Since the necessary
capacitance is reduced, the VRM power density is dramatically
increased by six times. Also, since each module handles a lower
current, the circuit will be packaged more easily. The test
results in Figure 1.22 show the transient response of the
