Testing transistors
A bipolar transistor is essentially two 
diodes in one package, as illustrated in 
Figure 16-12. (For a PNP transistor, both 
diodes are reversed.) If your multimeter 
has neither a transistor‐checking feature 
nor a diode‐checking feature, you can use 
the ohms setting to test most bipolar tran-
sistors, in much the same way you test 
diodes: You set your meter to a low‐value 
resistance range, and test each diode 
within your transistor in turn.
