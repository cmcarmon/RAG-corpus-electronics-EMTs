In mid-1991, because of uncertainty as to the suitability of using S-band frequencies for terrestrial broad-
casting, most DAB system development work in the United States shifted from out-band (i.e., UHF, L-band,
and  S-band)  to  in-band.  In-band  terrestrial  systems  would  merge  DAB  services  with  existing  AM  and  FM
broadcasts, using novel adjacent- and co-channel modulating schemes. Since 1992, two system proponents have
demonstrated  proprietary  methods  of  extracting  a  compatible  digital  RF  signal  from  co-channel  analog  FM
broadcast transmissions. Thus, in-band DAB could permit a logical transition from analog to digital broad-
casting for current broadcasters, within the current channel allocation scheme.
