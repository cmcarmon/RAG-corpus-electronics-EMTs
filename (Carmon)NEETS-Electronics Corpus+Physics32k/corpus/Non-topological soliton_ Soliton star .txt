If the scalar field potential

{\displaystyle U(\sigma )}
has two degenerate or almost degenerate minima, one of them have to be the real (true) minimum in which we happen to leave. Inside NTS



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
occupies another one. In such a model non-zero vacuum energy appears only at the NTS surface, not in its volume. This allows for the NTS to be very big without falling in gravitational collapse.
That is the case in the left-right symmetric electroweak theory. For a scale of symmetry breaking about 1 TeV,

both boson and fermion soliton stars were investigated.
A complex scalar field could alone form the state of gravitational equilibrium possessing the astronomically large conserved number of particles. Such objects are called minisoliton stars because of their microscopic size.
