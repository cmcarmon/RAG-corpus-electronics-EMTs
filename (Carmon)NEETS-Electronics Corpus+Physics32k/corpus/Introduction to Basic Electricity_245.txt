A	strategic	circuit	design	is	important	since	a	circuit	may	not	function	at	all	in	the
absence	of	a	good	plan;	if	the	placement	of	each	of	its	components	wasn’t
accomplished	according,	you	may	have	just	wasted	resources.	You	may	have	the
correct	components	but	if	they	are	not	designed	properly,	a	circuit	is	far	from
working.	Besides,	at	the	realization	that	you	may	not	be	design	a	circuit’s	system
according	to	requirements,	you	wouldn’t	want	to	put	the	circuit-building	project	to
an	end	at	the	middle	of	the	process,	right?
Moreover,	the	proper	design	structure	of	a	circuit	needs	to	be	prioritized.
Regardless	if	it	is	not	meant	to	impress	another,	it	should	still	be	designed
accordingly	as	to	be	a	stepping	stone	in	the	possibility	of	handling	more	projects
eventually.	With	the	knowledge	of	how	to	design	a	circuit	properly	as	a	beginner
comes	the	effortless	knowledge	on	the	construction	of	more	advanced	circuits
eventually.
