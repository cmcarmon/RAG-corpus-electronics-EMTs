showing that the output is the derivative of the input. Differentiator cir-
cuits are electronically unstable because any electrical noise within the
circuit  is  exaggerated  by  the  differentiator.  For  this  reason,  the  differ-
entiator  circuit  in  Fig.  6.37  is  not  as  useful  and  popular  as  the  inte-
grator. It is seldom used in practice.
