Sf and Sb are known as forward (or positive-sequence) slip and backward (or negative-sequence)
slip, respectively. Assuming that the two component mmfs exist separately, the frequency and
magnitude of the component emfs induced in the rotor by their presence will, in general, be
different because Sf is not equal to Sb. Then the machine can be thought of as producing a steady
total torque as the algebraic sum of the component torques. The equivalent circuit based on
the revolving-ﬁeld theory is pursued in Section 13.2. At standstill, however, ωm = 0 and the
component torques are equal and opposite; no starting torque is produced. Thus, it is clear that
a single-phase induction motor is not capable of self-starting, but it will continue to rotate once
started in any direction. In practice, additional means are provided to get the machine started
(usually as an asymmetrical two-phase motor) from a single-phase source, and the machine is
then run as a single-phase motor. An approximate shape of the torque–speed curve for the single-
phase motor can readily be obtained from that of the three-phase machine shown in Figure 13.1.6.
Corresponding to a positive slip of Sf = OP in Figure 13.1.6, the positive-sequence torque is PQ.
Then, corresponding to Sb = 2 − Sf = OR, the negative-sequence torque is RS. The resultant
torque is given by P Q − RS. This procedure can be repeated for a range of slips 1 ≤ S ≤ 0
to give the general form of the torque–speed characteristic of a single-phase induction motor, as
shown in Figure 13.1.7.
