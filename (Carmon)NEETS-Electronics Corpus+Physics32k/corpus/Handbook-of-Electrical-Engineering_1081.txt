of the corresponding DT sequences, as speciﬁed by Property 7. This latter property is quite different from the
linear convolution property of the DTFT. Circular convolution is simply a linear convolution of the periodic
extensions of the ﬁnite sequences being convolved, where each of the ﬁnite sequences of length N deﬁnes the
structure of one period of the periodic extensions.
