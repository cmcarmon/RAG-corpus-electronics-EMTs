Hierarchy  is  used  in  the  procedural  paradigm  to  encapsulate  low-level  algorithms,  thus  abstracting  them
away.  That  is,  algorithm  abstraction  is  the  major  contributor  to  leveling  in  a  procedural  HLL.  Figure  87.11
illustrates  this  layering  as  a  tree  where  each  box  is  a  procedure  and  subordinate  boxes  represent  procedures
called by parent boxes, the top-most box is the most abstract, and the lowest boxes in the tree are the most
concrete.
