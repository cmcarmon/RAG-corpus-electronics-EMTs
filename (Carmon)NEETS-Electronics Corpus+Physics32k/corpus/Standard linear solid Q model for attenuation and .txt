A standard linear solid Q model (SLS) for attenuation and dispersion is one of many mathematical Q models that gives a definition of how the earth responds to seismic waves. When a plane wave propagates through a homogeneous viscoelastic medium, the effects of amplitude attenuation and velocity dispersion may be combined conveniently into a single dimensionless parameter, Q, the medium-quality factor.
Transmission losses may occur due to friction or fluid movement, and whatever the physical mechanism, they can be conveniently described with an empirical formulation where elastic moduli and propagation velocity are complex functions of frequency. Ursin and Toverud compared different Q models including the above model (SLS-model).
In order to compare the different models they considered plane-wave propagation in a homogeneous viscoelastic medium. They used the Kolsky-Futterman model as a reference and studied the SLS model. This model was compared with the Kolsky-Futterman model.
The Kolsky-Futterman model was first described in the article ‘Dispersive body waves’ by Futterman (1962).
