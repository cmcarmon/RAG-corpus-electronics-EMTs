You can use an ohmmeter to test transistors by measuring the emitter-collector, base-emitter, and
base-collector forward and reverse resistances. A back-to-forward resistance ratio on the order of 100 to 1
or greater should be obtained for the collector-to-base and emitter-to-base measurements. The forward
and reverse resistances between the emitter and collector should be nearly equal. You should make all
three measurements for each transistor you test, because experience has shown that transistors can
develop shorts between the collector and emitter and still have good forward and reverse resistances for
the other two measurements. Because of shunting resistances in transistor circuits, you will normally have
