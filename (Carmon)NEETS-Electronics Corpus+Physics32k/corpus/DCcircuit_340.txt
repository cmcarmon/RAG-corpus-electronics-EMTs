As we saw earlier, skin and body resistance has a lot to do with the relative hazard of
electric circuits. The higher the body’s resistance, the less likely harmful current will result
from any given amount of voltage. Conversely, the lower the body’s resistance, the more likely
for injury to occur from the application of a voltage.
