If the object is a homogeneous body, we can apply Green’s
theorem to the interior of the object to formulate another two
equations: EFIE and MFIE. One of these two equations can be
used with either equations 8.41 or 8.42 to form a complete
system for the solution of JJ s and M s. Again, to overcome the
problem of interior resonance, one can combine the EFIE and
MFIE to form the CFIE for the interior ﬁeld. This CFIE can
then be used with the CFIE for the exterior ﬁeld to form a
complete system (Rao and Wilton, 1990). A better approach is,
however, to add the EFIEs for the interior and exterior ﬁelds to
form a new integral equation. This is then used with the
integral equation obtained by adding the MFIEs for the inte-
rior and exterior ﬁelds. This formulation results from work by
Poggio and Miller (1973), Chang and Harrington (1977), and
Wu and Tsai (1977); the formulation is found to be free of
interior resonances and yields accurate and stable solutions
(Mautz and Harrington, 1979).
