▶✓ Double‐pole, single‐throw (DPST): This dual on/off switch contains four 
terminals — two input contacts and two output contacts — and behaves 
like two separate “make‐or‐break” SPST switches operating in sync. In 
the off position, both switches are open and no connections are made. 
In the on position, both switches are closed and connections are made 
between each input contact and its corresponding output contact.
