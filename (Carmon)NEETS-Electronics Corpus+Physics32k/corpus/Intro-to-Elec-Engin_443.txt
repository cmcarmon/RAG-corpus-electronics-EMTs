Negative feedback (which is said to be degenerative) is used to improve ampliﬁer performance
by sacriﬁcing gain. The opposite situation of positive feedback (which is said to be regenerative)
is also utilized, and gain is increased to the extent that an ampliﬁer will produce an output signal
with no input. This leads to sinusoidal oscillators and nonsinusoidal waveform generators.
