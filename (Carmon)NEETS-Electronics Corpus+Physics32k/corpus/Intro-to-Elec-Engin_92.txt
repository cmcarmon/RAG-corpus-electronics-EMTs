Practical inductors range from about 0.1 ÂµH to hundreds of millihenrys. Some, meant for
special applications in power supplies, can have values as large as several henrys. In general, the
larger the inductance, the lower its frequency is in its usage. The smallest inductance values are
generally used at radio frequencies. Although inductors have many applications, the total demand
does not even remotely approach the consumption of resistors and capacitors. Inductors generally
tend to be rather bulky and expensive, especially in low-frequency applications. Industry-wide
standardization for inductors is not done to the same degree as for more frequently used devices
such as resistors and capacitors.
