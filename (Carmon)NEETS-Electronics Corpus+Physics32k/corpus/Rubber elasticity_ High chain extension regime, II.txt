When a rubber sample is stretched sufficiently far, we know from experience that it breaks more or less cleanly in a plane perpendicular to the strain axis. It follows that covalent bonds on network chains must undergo a bond rupture as a consequence of the imposed strain. Some network chains can rupture before the entire sample completely fails but, as more and more chains break, too few network chains remain intact to support the imposed tensile stress, causing the sample to abruptly fail. The intrinsic molecular mechanisms that give rise to the strong elastic chain force in this region are bond distortions, e.g., bond angle increases, bond stretches and dihedral angle rotations. These forces are spring-like and are not associated with entropy changes. The tensile force along a chain required to cause bond rupture has been calculated via quantum chemistry simulations and it is approximately 7 N, about a factor of a thousand greater than the entropic chain forces at low strain. The angles between adjacent backbone C-C bonds in an isoprene unit vary between about 115-120 degrees and the forces associated with maintaining these angles are quite large, so within each unit, the chain backbone always follows a zigzag path. The same quantum chemistry simulations also predict that a natural rubber chain can be stretched by about 40% beyond its sensibly-straight state before rupture, and also provide a force extension curve (fit to a fifth order polynomial) that can be used in a numerical network model. The steep upturn in the elastic stress, observed at moderate to high strains (Fig. 2), is due to the extension of network chains beyond their sensibly-straight state.
