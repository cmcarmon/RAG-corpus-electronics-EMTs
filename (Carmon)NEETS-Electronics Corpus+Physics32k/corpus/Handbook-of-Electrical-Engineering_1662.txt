Figure 16.2 shows a block diagram of the EKF. Note that the EKF uses the nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear
measurement  equations  to  predict  xk  and  zk,  rather  than  using  a  linear  approximation.  In  contrast,  the  EKF
uses  linear  approximations  of  f(x)  and  h(x)  to  compute  the  covariance  matrices  and  the  Kalman  Ô¨Ålter  gain.
The nonlinear dynamical model for x is:
