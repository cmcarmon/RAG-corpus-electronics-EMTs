When reactance and resistance are combined, the value of the impedance will be greater than either. 
It is also true that the current will not be in step with the voltage nor will it differ in phase by exactly 90 
degrees from the voltage, but it will be somewhere between the in-step and the 90-degree out-of-step 
conditions. The larger the reactance compared with the resistance, the more nearly the phase difference 
will approach 90ยบ . The larger the resistance compared to the reactance, the more nearly the phase 
difference will approach zero degrees.
