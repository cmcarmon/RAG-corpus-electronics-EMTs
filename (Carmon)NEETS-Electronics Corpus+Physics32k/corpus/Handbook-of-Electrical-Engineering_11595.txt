The  mathematical  equation  used  to  generate  this  three-dimensional  ﬁgure  is  worth  a
thousand words. It represents a single-solitron surface for the sine-Gordon equation wuv =
sin w. Among the areas in which the sine-Gordon equation arises is that of wave propagation
on nonlinear transmission lines and in semi-conductors. The equation is famous because
it is known to have a nonlinear superposition principle obtainable by means of a Bäcklund
Transformation. The sine-Gordon equation is an example of an evolution equation which
has  an  inﬁnite  sequence  of  non-trivial  conservation  laws  so  important  in  the  ﬁelds  of
engineering and physics. For further information on the Bäcklund Transformation see Bäck-
lund Transformations and their Application, Rogers and Shadwick, Academic Press, 1982.
