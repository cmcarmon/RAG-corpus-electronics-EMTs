where Z symbolizes the internal subsystem descriptions or
component parameters and where f symbolizes the connection
function. In the special case where the subsystems represented
by Z are linear and time-invariant, Z may be interpreted as a
matrix of component transfer functions, gains, or immitances
(the precise physical interpretation is unimportant), which is
also the case for S. One should not, however, restrict the
thinking process to linear time-invariant systems. In addition,
it is important to point out that, even when all of the subsys-
tems are linear, the connection function f is nonlinear.
