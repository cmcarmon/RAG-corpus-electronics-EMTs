a conductive joint between parts such as wires, component leads, and 
circuit boards. You will need it to attach leads to a few potentiometers 
(variable resistors). Models range from a low‐end Weller SP25NKUS  
($20 at Home Depot) to the mid‐range Weller WLC‐100 ($44 at Home 
Depot) to the top‐notch Weller WES51 ($129 at Mouser.com). You need 
60/40 rosin‐core solder in either 0.031‐inch or 0.062‐inch diameters, such 
as top‐of‐the‐line Kester 44 ($30 for a 1‐lb. spool).
