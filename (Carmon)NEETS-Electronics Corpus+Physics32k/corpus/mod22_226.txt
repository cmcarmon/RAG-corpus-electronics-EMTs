The page contains the status of every picture element on the display screen. The page is usually 
stored in some form of random-access memory, RAM chips being the most common. The contents of 
page memory, or, as it is sometimes called, video memory, are continually scanned by the video 
generation logic and used to develop the video signals for the picture element display. The picture 
element locations in page memory are read in time to develop the video signals for the picture element 
display on the horizontal lines.
