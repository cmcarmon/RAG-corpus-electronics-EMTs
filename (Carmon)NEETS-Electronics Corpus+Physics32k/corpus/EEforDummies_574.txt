Diodes known as visible LEDs (or just LEDs) are specially made to emit copi­
ous amounts of visible light. By varying the semiconductor materials used, 
diodes can be engineered to emit light in many colors, including red, orange, 
yellow, green, blue, white, and even pink. (The 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics 
was awarded to researchers Akasaki, Amano, and Nakamura for their inven­
tion of the blue LED in the 1990s.) Bi‐color and tri‐color LEDs contain two or 
three different diodes in one package.
