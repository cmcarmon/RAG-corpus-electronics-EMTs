. Network layer: Responsibilities of this layer include pro-
viding the data integrity transmission for a point-to-
point connection so that data will not be lost or dupli-
cated. The layer accomplishes this task by maintaining a
sequential order of frames that are transmitted over a data
link connection and detecting and correcting transmis-
sion errors with retransmission of the frames, if necessary.
The other important function in the data link layer is to
provide ï¬‚ow control, which is a way to allow the receiving
station to inform the sending station of stopping trans-
mission for a moment so that the receiver will not over-
load its buffers.
