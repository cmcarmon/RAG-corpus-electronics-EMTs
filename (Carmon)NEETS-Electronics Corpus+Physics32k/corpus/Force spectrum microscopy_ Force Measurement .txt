The fluctuations of PEGylated tracers coupled to aggregate myosin motor forces can be likened to a Hookean spring,




F

{\displaystyle F=kx}

where the force



F


{\displaystyle F}
applied to generate the oscillation displacement



x


{\displaystyle x}
is proportional to the effective spring constant



k


{\displaystyle k}
of the intracellular environment. The displacement during oscillation is a spatial function of time, which can be directly measured using optical microscopy. A Fourier transform then maps information in the temporal domain to the frequency domain to derive a useful dimension as a function of frequency,

can be retrieved by a Fourier Transform from the frequency domain back to the temporal domain. In the context of oscillation frequency, the higher the force frequency spectrum, the greater the metabolic activity of the cell. Independent micromechanical measurements can calculate the elasticity of the cytoplasm. By using an optical tweezer to apply a prescribed force to a tracer particle, FSM can measure the resulting displacement in order to estimate the elastic spring constant.
