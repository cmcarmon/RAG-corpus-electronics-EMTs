Fiber optics deals with the transmission of light energy through transparent fibers. How an optical
fiber guides light depends on the nature of the light and the structure of the optical fiber. A light wave is a
form of energy that is moved by wave motion. Wave motion can be defined as a recurring disturbance
advancing through space with or without the use of a physical medium. In fiber optics, wave motion is the
movement of light energy through an optical fiber. To fully understand the concept of wave motion, refer
to NEETSModule 10â€”Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas. Before we
introduce the subject of light transmission through optical fibers, you must first understand the nature of
light and the properties of light waves.
