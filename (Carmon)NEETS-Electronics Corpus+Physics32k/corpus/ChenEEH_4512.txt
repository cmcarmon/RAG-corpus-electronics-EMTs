where p denotes a step in the parameter space and where
Fk, gk, and Gk denote the value, gradient, and Hessian of the
objective function at uk. Equation 6.22 indicates that to ﬁnd a
local minimum of the objective function, an iterative searching
procedure is required. The celebrated Newton’s method is
deﬁned by choosing the step p ¼ pk so that uk þ pk
is a
stationary point of the quadratic model in 6.22. This amounts
to solving the following linear equation:
