Now letâ€™s see what happens when a modulating signal is applied. The magnitude of the introduced
reactance is determined by the magnitude of the superimposed current through the tank. The magnitude of
Ip for a given E1 is determined by the transconductance of V1. (Transconductance was covered in NEETS,
Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies.) Therefore, the value of
reactance introduced into the tuned circuit varies directly with the transconductance of the reactance tube.
When a modulating signal is applied to the grid of V1, both E1 and I change, causing transconductance to
vary with the modulating signal. This causes a variable reactance to be introduced into the tuned circuit.
This variable reactance either adds to or subtracts from the fixed value of reactance that is introduced in
the absence of the modulating signal. This action varies the reactance across the oscillator which, in turn,
varies the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator. These variations in the oscillator frequency are
proportional to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating voltage. Reactance-tube modulators are
usually operated at low power levels. The required output power is developed in power amplifier stages
that follow the modulators.
