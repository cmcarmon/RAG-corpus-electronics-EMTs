Existing computer models often do not perform internal checks on the results they produce but instead leave
that as an exercise for the user. It would be of extremely great potential value if a variety of such checks could
be built into the code and exercised as desired by the modeler. The topic of error checking and validation is
an active one in CEM and receives a great deal of ongoing attention, for which the technical literature provides
a good point of departure for the reader interested in more detail.
