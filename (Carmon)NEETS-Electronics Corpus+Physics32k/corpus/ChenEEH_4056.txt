where H (0) is the zero-frequency (dc) response of the system.
Equation 1.35 states that the mean of the random process
Y (t ) produced at the output of a linear time-invariant system
in response to X(t ) acting as the input process is equal to the
mean of X(t ) multiplied by the dc response of the system,
which is intuitively satisfying.
