Q1 is biased for slight conduction with no input signal applied. When an input signal appears on the
base of Q1, it is rectified by the emitter-base junction (operating as a diode) and is developed across R1 as
a dc bias voltage with a varying af component. This voltage controls bias and collector current for Q1.
The output is developed by collector current flow through R4. Any rf ripple in the output is bypassed
across the collector load resistor by capacitor C4. The af variations are not bypassed. After the modulation
envelope is detected in the base circuit, it is amplified in the output circuit to provide suitable af output.
The output of this circuit is higher than is possible with a simple detector. Because of the amplification in
this circuit, weaker signals can be detected than with a simple detector. A higher, more usable output is
thus developed.
