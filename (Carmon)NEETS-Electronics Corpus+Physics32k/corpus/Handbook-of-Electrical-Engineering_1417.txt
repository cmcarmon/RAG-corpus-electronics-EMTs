After  an  acoustic  speech  signal  is  converted  to  an  electrical  signal  by  a  microphone,  it  may  be  desirable  to
analyze  the  electrical  signal  to  estimate  some  time-varying  parameters  which  provide  information  about  a
model  of  the  speech  production  mechanism.  Speech  analysis  is  the  process  of  estimating  such  parameters.
Similarly, given some parametric model of speech production and a sequence of parameters for that model,
speech synthesis is the process of creating an electrical signal which approximates speech. While analysis and
synthesis techniques may be done either on the continuous signal or on a sampled version of the signal, most
modern analysis and synthesis methods are based on digital signal processing.
