Note that n dots above a vector indicates its nth time derivative. The scalar product of each side of Newton's law with the velocity vector yields

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }}=m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}\cdot {\dot {\mathbf {X} }},}

because the constraint forces are perpendicular to the particle velocity. Integrate this equation along its trajectory from the point X(t1) to the point X(t2) to obtain

The left side of this equation is the work of the applied force as it acts on the particle along the trajectory from time t1 to time t2. This can also be written as

This integral is computed along the trajectory X(t) of the particle and is therefore path dependent.
