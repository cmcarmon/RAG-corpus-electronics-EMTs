This chapter has presented only the basic operating theory of saturable-core reactors and magnetic
amplifiers. For your convenience, simple schematic diagrams have been used to illustrate this material.
When magnetic amplifiers and saturable-core reactors are used in actual equipment, the schematics may
be more complex than those you have seen here. Also, you may find coils used in addition to those
presented in this chapter. The technical manual for the equipment in question should contain the
information you need to supplement what you have read in this chapter.
