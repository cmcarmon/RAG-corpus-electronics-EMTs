Fleet broadcasts follow regular schedules. Messages are placed on the schedules in order of 
precedence. If a message of higher precedence is given to a transmitter station while a lower precedence 
message is being transmitted, the latter message may be interrupted to transmit the message of higher 
precedence. All ships copy all messages appearing on the broadcast schedule they are guarding.
