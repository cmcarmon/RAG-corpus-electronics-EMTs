During the 1980s, a new architectural concept was introduced; it came to be called the intelligent network.
It allowed new telecommunications services to be introduced rapidly and in a ubiquitous and uniform fashion.
Feature and service availability in the network ceased to be solely dependent upon the hardware and software
in  stored-program  control  switches.  Rather  some  new  intelligence  was  centralized  in  databases  which  were
accessed using packet switching techniques. Most signiÔ¨Åcantly, the intelligent network started to provide some
of the capabilities that operators had made available in the early years of telephony. The remaining sections of
this chapter describe the intelligent network, its characteristics, and its services. They also provide a description of
the advanced intelligent network, which dramatically broadens the participation in the creation of new services.
