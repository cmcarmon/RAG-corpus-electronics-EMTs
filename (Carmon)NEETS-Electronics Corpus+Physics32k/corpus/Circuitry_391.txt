identical  input  and  output  resistances  of  
600 P. Determine the input voltage required 
 
 
to produce an output of 10 V. 
7.3   Determine  the  mid-band  voltage  gain  and 
upper  and  lower  cut-off  frequencies  for  the 
 
 
amplifier whose frequency response curve is 
shown  in  Fig.  7.53.  Also  determine  the 
 
voltage gain at frequencies of: 
 
(a) 10 Hz 
 
 
(b) 1 MHz 
7.4   An amplifier with negative feedback applied 
has  an  open-loop  voltage  gain  of  250,  and  
 
5%  of  its  output  is  fed  back  to  the  input. 
 
 
Determine  the  overall  voltage  gain  with 
negative feedback applied. If the open-loop 
 
voltage gain increases by 20% determine the 
 
 
new value of overall voltage gain.
