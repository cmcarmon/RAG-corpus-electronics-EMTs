F I G U R E 6.31 Characteristics of
the MOSFET according to the SR
model. The top-left, bottom-left,
and the bottom-right quadrants are
not shown for the reasons given in
Section 6.3. As discussed in more
detail in Chapter 7, the region in
which the MOSFET displays
resistive behavior is within the
triode region of MOSFET operation.
