In the planning process, steady-state stability is evaluated via power-ﬂow programs by the system’s ability to
meet  equipment  loading  criteria  and  transmission  voltage  criteria  under  steady-state  conditions.  Transient
stability is evaluated via stability programs by simulating system transient response for various types of distur-
bances, including short circuits and other abrupt network changes. The planning engineer designs the system
to remain stable for the following typical disturbances:
