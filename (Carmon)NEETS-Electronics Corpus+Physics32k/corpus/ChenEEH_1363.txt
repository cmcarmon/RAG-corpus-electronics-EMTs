Message passing interface (MPI) is a library of standard
subroutines for sending and receiving messages and perform-
ing collective operations (Foster, 1995). A computation con-
sists of processes created at program initialization. Processes
can use point-to-point communication to send messages to
one another. A group of processes can perform collectively in
global operations, such as summation and broadcast. MPI
provides support for program modularity: MPI modules can
encapsulate internal communication structures. Such modules
can be combined by sequential or parallel composition.
