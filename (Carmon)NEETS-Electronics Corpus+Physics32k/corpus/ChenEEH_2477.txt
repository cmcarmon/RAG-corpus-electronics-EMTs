Assuming that the element factor EF does not change signiÔ¨Å-
cantly from the main beam to the side lobe of the array, the
SLL of equation 6.201 is approximately equal to the SLL of the
total radiation pattern. Remember that this SLL is derived for
any large array (N ! 1) while assuming that the amplitudes
of excitation are uniform over the array. One can achieve a
lower value of SLL, however, by using a nonuniform amplitude
distribution.
