Since the operating principles of low-frequency and microwave antennas are essentially the same, 
the electrical characteristics are also very similar. You will need a fundamental knowledge of radar and 
communications antenna electrical theory in your shipboard antenna maintenance work. Antenna theory 
is primarily a design consideration of antenna size and shape requirements that depend on the frequency 
used. A brief description of antenna electrical characteristics is sufficient for the needs of most students of 
electronics.
