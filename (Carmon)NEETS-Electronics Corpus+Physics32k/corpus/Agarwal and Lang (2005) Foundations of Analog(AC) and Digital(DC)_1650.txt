c e s s o r In this example, we will estimate the average power consumed by a
microprocessor based on the simple formula developed in Equation 11.31. The Raw
microprocessor designed at MIT using IBMâ€™s 180-nm, SA27E CMOS technology pro-
cess, had about 3 million gates (assume each gate is equivalent to a 2-input NAND gate)
and clocked at 425 MHz. Assume each gate offered a load capacitance of approximately
30-nF, and the nominal supply voltage is 1.5 V. Assume further that approximately 25%
of the gates switch values in a given cycle.
