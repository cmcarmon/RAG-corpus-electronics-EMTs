Hemorrhage (escape of blood) occurs whenever there is a break in the wall of one or more blood 
vessels. In most small cuts, only capillaries are injured. Deeper wounds result in injury to veins or 
arteries. Bleeding which is severe enough to endanger life seldom occurs except when arteries or veins 
are cut.
