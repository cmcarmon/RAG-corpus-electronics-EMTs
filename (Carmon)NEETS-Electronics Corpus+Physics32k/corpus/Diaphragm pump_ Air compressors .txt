Small mechanically activated diaphragm pumps are also used as air compressors and as a source of low-grade vacuum. Compared to other compressors, these pumps are quiet, cheap and, most importantly, have no moving parts in the airstream. This allows them to be used without added lubrication in contact with the air, so the compressed air produced can be guaranteed clean.
