Smart Structural Materials
Intelligent structural engineering materials are the classical versions of smart systems in which the mechanical
(elastic) properties of a structure can be modiÔ¨Åed adaptively by means of an imbedded distribution of smart
material(s), and an associated (integral) set of sensors and actuators together with an external control system
to facilitate adaptive changes in the elastic behavior of structures so that motion, vibration, strength, stiffness,
redistribution of load path in response to damage, etc. are controlled.
