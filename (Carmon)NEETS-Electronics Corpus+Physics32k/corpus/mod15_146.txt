As we stated earlier, the speed and accuracy of data transmission are most important. With the use of 
more complex synchros, like the differential and the control transformer, the accuracy of the synchro 
systems may be affected. The following discussion will deal with how complex synchros affect the 
accuracy of synchro systems and what can be done to keep this accuracy as high as possible. Synchro 
capacitors play a major role in maintaining a high degree of accuracy in synchro systems.
