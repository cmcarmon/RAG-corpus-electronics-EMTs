Commutation is the process by which a dc voltage output is taken from an armature that has an ac 
voltage induced in it. You should remember from our discussion of the elementary dc generator that the 
commutator mechanically reverses the armature loop connections to the external circuit. This occurs at 
the same instant that the voltage polarity in the armature loop reverses. A dc voltage is applied to the load 
because the output connections are reversed as each commutator segment passes under a brush. The 
segments are insulated from each other.
