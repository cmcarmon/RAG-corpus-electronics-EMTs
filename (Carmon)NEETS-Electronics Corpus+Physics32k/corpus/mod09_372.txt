Essentially, all the current in the circuit flows through Q1; Q1 offers almost no resistance to current 
flow. Notice that capacitor C1 is charging. Since Q1 offers almost no resistance in its saturated state, the 
rate of charge of C1 depends only on the time constant of R2 and C1 (recall that TC = RC). Notice that 
the right-hand side of capacitor C1 is connected to the base of transistor Q2, which is now at cutoff.
