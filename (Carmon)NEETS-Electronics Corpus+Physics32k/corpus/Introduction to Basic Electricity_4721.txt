In the 6800 and 6502 microprocessors, the content 
of the register is stored in the stack, and then the stack 
pointer is decremented by 1. This allows the stack 
pointer to point to the next memory location where 
data can be saved. The stack pointer is a 16-bit register 
that is used to define the memory location that acts as 
the top of the stack. When the pull instruction is used, 
the stack pointer is incremented by 1, and the data are 
retrieved from the stack and placed in the appropriate 
register. In the 8080A, the top of the stack contains the 
pointer to the last memory location. The push instruc-
tion first decrements the stack pointer by 1 and then 
stores the register content in the stack.
