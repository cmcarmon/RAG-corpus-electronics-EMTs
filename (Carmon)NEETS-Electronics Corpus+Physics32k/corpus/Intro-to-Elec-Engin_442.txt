An op amp along with a few external components (resistors and capacitors) is capable of
performing many different operations—hence the name operational. The linear operations of
integration, differentiation, addition, and subtraction that were needed in analog computers are
some of the early applications. Other linear applications include instrumentation ampliﬁers,
voltage-to-current and current-to-voltage converters, voltage followers, and active ﬁlters. Op
amps are also utilized in nonlinear applications such as limiters, comparators, voltage regulators,
signal rectiﬁers and detectors, logarithmic ampliﬁers, multipliers, and many digital circuits.
