that caused the increased current or heat is corrected, a new fuse must be placed in the circuit. A circuit
protection device that can be used more than once solves the problems of replacement fuses. Such a
device is safe, reliable, and tamper proof. It is also resettable, so it can be reused without replacing any
parts. This device is called a CIRCUIT BREAKER because it breaks (opens) the circuit.
