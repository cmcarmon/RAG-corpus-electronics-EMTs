Three of the four main (midfrequency) parameters for the CE stage have now been derived, all from a rather
primitive understanding of the transistor itself. The fourth, Rou t, is the dynamic, incremental, or small-signal
resistance  of  the  transistor  from  collector  to  emitter,  which  is  the  slope  of  the  output  characteristic  at  the
working  point  rc e.  Being  associated  with  a  reverse-biased  (CB)  junction,  this  is  high—typically  about
0.5 MW—so that the transistor acts as a current source feeding a comparatively low load resistance RC. Sum-
