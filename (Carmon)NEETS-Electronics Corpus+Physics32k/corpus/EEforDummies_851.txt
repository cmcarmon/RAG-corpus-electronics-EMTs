The positive and negative terminals of the battery connect so that each end 
of the electromagnet has the same polarity as the permanent magnet next to 
it. Like poles of magnets repel each other. This repelling action moves the 
electromagnet and causes the axle to spin. As the axle spins, the positive and 
negative connections to the electromagnet swap places, so the magnets con-
tinue to push the axle around.
