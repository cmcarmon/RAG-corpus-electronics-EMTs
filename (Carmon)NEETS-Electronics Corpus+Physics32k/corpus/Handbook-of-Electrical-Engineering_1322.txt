Model Adaptation
Adaptation algorithms for coder predictor or quantizer parameters can be loosely grouped based on the signals
 coder elements analyze the input speech
that are used as the basis for adaptation. Generally, 
(or a ﬁltered version of it) to characterize predictor coefﬁcients, spectral components, or quantizer parameters
  coder  elements  analyze  a  reconstructed  signal,  which  contains

quantization noise, to adjust coder parameters in a sequential fashion. Forward adaptive coder elements can
produce a more efﬁcient model of speech signal characteristics, but introduce delay into the coder’s operation
due to buffering of the signal. Backward adaptive coder elements do not introduce delay, but produce signal
models  that  have  lower  ﬁdelity  with  respect  to  the  original  speech  due  to  the  dependence  on  the  noisy
reconstructed signal. Most low-rate coders rely on some form of forward adaptation. This requires moderate
to high delay in processing for accuracy of parameter estimation (autocorrelations/autocovariances for LPC-
based coders, sinusoidal resolution for frequency-domain coders). The allowance of signiﬁcant delay for many
coder architectures has enabled a spectrally matched pre- or post-processing step to reduce apparent quanti-
zation  noise  and  provide  signiﬁcant  perceptual  improvements.  Perceptual  enhancements  combined  with
analysis-by-synthesis
  optimization,  and  enabled  by  recent  advances  in  high-power  computing  architectures
such as digital signal processors, have tremendously improved speech coding results at medium and low rates.
