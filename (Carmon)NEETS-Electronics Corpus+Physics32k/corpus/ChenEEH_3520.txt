A discrete-time or continuous-time input signal is denoted
by x[n] or xc(t ), respectively, while the corresponding output
signal is denoted as y[n] or yc(t ). The system (i.e., the trans-
formation that maps that input signal into the output signal) is
denoted by T so that y[n] ¼ T (x[n]) or yc (t) ¼ T (xc(t)). We
will often refer to the system itself as T.
