Perhaps the most transparent (to the user) artiﬁcial arms are the ones that use electrical activity generated
by the muscles remaining in the stump to control the actions of the elbow, wrist, and hand [Stein et al., 1988].
This electrical activity is known as myoelectricity, and is produced as the muscle contraction spreads through
the muscle. Note that these muscles, if intact, would have controlled at least one of these joints (e.g., the biceps
and  triceps  for  the  elbow).  Thus,  a  high  level  of  modality  speciﬁcity  is  maintained  because  the  functional
element is substituted only at the last stage. All of the batteries, sensor electrodes, ampliﬁers, motor actuators,
and controllers (generally analog) reside entirely within these myoelectric arms. An individual trained in the
use of a myoelectric arm can perform some impressive tasks with this arm. Current engineering research efforts
involve  the  control  of  simultaneous  multi-joint  movements  (rather  than  the  single  joint  movement  now
available) and the provision for sensory feedback from the end effector of the artiﬁcial arm to the skin of the
stump via electrical means.
