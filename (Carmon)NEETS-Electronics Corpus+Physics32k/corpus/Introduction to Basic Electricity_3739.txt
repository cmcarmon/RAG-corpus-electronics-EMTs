As in the real world, the resistor values required in 
this circuit are not exact values, but are rounded. The 
closest 1% resistor value is 549 V (Figure 36-42) and the 
closest 2%, 5%, and 10% resistor is 560 V (Figure 13-5).
Resistor R1 consumes power and dissipates it as 
heat if it has too small a power rating. The amount 
of power that will be dissipated by the resistor can be 
determined using the power formula, P = IE (Chap-
terÂ 17). The voltage across R1 is 114 volts, and the cur-
rent through it is 210 mA.
