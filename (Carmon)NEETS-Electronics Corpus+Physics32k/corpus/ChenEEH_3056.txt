Many other types of control are also used for the normal
and emergency operations of the power system. For example,
remote operation of circuit breakers can be manually initiated
by operators through the supervisory control and data acqui-
sition (SCADA) system at the control center. Voltage control is
done automatically by generators, transformers, reactors, and
capacitors, but the operator can remotely set the target volt-
ages. Control and operation are covered in Chapter 8, Power
System Operation and Control.
