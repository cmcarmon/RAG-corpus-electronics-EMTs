End users (equipment manufacturers, shipbuilders, maintenance personnel, test personnel, and so on)
should measure some of these parameters upon receipt before installing the component into the fiber optic
data link. These tests determine if the component has been damaged in the shipping process. In addition,
end users should measure some component parameters after installing or repairing fiber optic components
in the field. The values obtained can be compared to the system installation specifications. These
measurements determine if the installation or repair process has degraded component performance and
will affect data link operation.
