The magnitude of current flow is affected by the difference of potential in the following manner.
Initially, mobile electrons are given additional energy because of the repelling and attracting electrostatic
field. If the potential difference is increased, the electric field will be stronger, the amount of energy
imparted to a mobile electron will be greater, and the current will be increased. If the potential difference
is decreased, the strength of the field is reduced, the energy supplied to the electron is diminished, and the
current is decreased.
