Keying a transmitter causes an rf signal to be radiated only when the key contacts are closed. When 
the key contacts are open, the transmitter does not radiate energy. Keying is accomplished in either the 
oscillator or amplifier stage of a transmitter. A number of different keying systems are used in Navy 
transmitters.
