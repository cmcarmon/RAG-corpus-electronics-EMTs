The Newton loop-node method is based on Kirchhoffâ€™s first and second laws. The Newton loop-node method is the combination of the Newton nodal and loop methods and does not solve loop equations explicitly. The loop equations are transformed to an equivalent set of nodal equations, which are then solved to yield the nodal pressures. The nodal pressures are used then to calculate the corrections to the chord flows (which is synonymous to loop flows), and the tree branch flows are obtained from them.
