The  Maxwell  equations  are  fundamental  laws  governing  the  behavior  of  electromagnetic  ﬁelds  in  free  space
and in media. We have so far made no reference to the various material properties that provide connections
to other disciplines of physics, such as plasma physics, continuum mechanics, solid-state physics, ﬂuid dynamics,
statistical physics, thermodynamics, biophysics, etc., all of which interact in one way or another with electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. We did not even mention the Lorentz force law, which constitutes a direct link to mechanics.
It is time to state how we are going to account for this vast “outside” world. From the electromagnetic wave
point of view, we shall be interested in how electromagnetic ﬁelds behave in the presence of media, whether
the wave is diffracted, refracted, or scattered. Whatever happens to a medium, whether it is moved or deformed,
is of secondary interest. Thus we shall characterize material media by the so-called constitutive relations that
can be classiﬁed according to the various properties of the media.
