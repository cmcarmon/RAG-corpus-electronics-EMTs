Point of interest: Music compact discs (CDs) encode their signals at a sampling rate of
44.1 kHz. Weâ€™ll learn the rationale for this number later. The 11.025 kHz sampling rate for the
speech is 1/4 of the CD sampling rate, and was the lowest available sampling rate commensurate
with speech signal bandwidths available on my computer.
