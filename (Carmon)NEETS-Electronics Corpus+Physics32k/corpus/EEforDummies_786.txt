▶✓ Plugs and receptacles carry audio and video signals between pieces of 
equipment that have cables like the ones you see in Figure 12-2. Plugs 
on each end of the cable connect to receptacles on the equipment being 
connected. Analog audio cables (see Figure 12-2, left) contain one or two 
signal wires (which carry the audio signal) and a metal shield surround-
ing the wires. The metal shield protects the signal wires from electrical 
interference (known as noise) by minimizing the introduction of stray 
current into the wires. Digital multimedia cables, such as the High‐
Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) cable on the right in Figure 12-2, 
contain multiple shielded wires that carry digital audio and video data.
