A variable capacitor is constructed in such manner that its value of capacitance can be varied. A typical
variable capacitor (adjustable capacitor) is the rotor-stator type. It consists of two sets of metal plates
arranged so that the rotor plates move between the stator plates. Air is the dielectric. As the position of the
rotor is changed, the capacitance value is likewise changed. This type of capacitor is used for tuning most
radio receivers. Its physical appearance and its symbol are shown in figure 3-19.
