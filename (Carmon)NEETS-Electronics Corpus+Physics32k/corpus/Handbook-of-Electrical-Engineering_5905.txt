When  the  generator  is  connected  to  an  electrical  load,  load  currents  ﬂow  through  the  rotor  conductors.
Therefore, a magnetic ﬁeld is set up in addition to that of the permanent magnet. This additional ﬁeld generally
weakens the magnetic ﬂux seen by the rotor conductors. A direct consequence is that the induced emf ’s are
less than those in an unloaded machine. Similar to the case of ac generators, this phenomenon is referred to
as armature reaction, or ﬂux-weakening effect.
