where VOUT is a DC voltage produced by VB and vout
produced by the incremental voltage source vi.
Assuming that vi = 10
with VN = 10 volts, determine the incremental output voltage vout.
p r o b l e m 4.14 Consider the diode network shown in Figure 4.68.
For purposes of this problem, the iD âˆ’ vD characteristics of all of the diodes can be
accurately represented as
