Opposing voltage change
Because it takes time for charges to build on the capacitor plates when a DC 
voltage is applied, and it takes time for the charge to leave the plates after 
the DC voltage is removed, capacitors are said to “oppose voltage change.” 
This just means that if you suddenly change the voltage applied to a capaci-
tor, it can’t react right away; the voltage across the capacitor changes more 
slowly than the voltage you applied.
