Microwave passive components may be composed of
lumped elements (inductors, capacitors, and resistors) or
distributed elements (transmission line sections and discon-
tinuities) or both. The circuit is arranged in a particular
conﬁguration (topology) so that selected signal properties
(amplitude, frequency, and phase) are processed or controlled
in a desired manner. The lumped elements may also be
regarded as a special class of transmission line structures
whose geometrical size is always within a small fraction of
the operating wavelength and thus, the embedded electromag-
netic ﬁelds behave in a stationary manner. In that sense, all
microwave passive components can be considered as transmis-
sion line structures consisting of certain transmission line
discontinuities and connecting lines commensurate with wave-
lengths.
