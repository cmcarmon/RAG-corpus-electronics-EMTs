The primary substrate material in integrated optics is the widely available synthetic crystal, lithium niobate
(LiNbO3), which has been commercially produced in volume for more than 20 years. This material is transparent
to optical wavelengths between 400 and 4500 nm, has a hardness similar to glass, and is nontoxic.
