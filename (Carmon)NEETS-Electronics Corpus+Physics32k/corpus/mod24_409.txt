Other cylindrical ferrule connectors have a ferrule that contains both metal and ceramic. For these
connectors a ceramic capillary is placed within the tip of a metal ferrule to provide for precision fiber
alignment. The ceramic capillary is a ceramic tube with a small inner diameter that is just larger than the
diameter of the fiber. Figure 4-17 shows the placement of the ceramic capillary within the metal ferrule.
