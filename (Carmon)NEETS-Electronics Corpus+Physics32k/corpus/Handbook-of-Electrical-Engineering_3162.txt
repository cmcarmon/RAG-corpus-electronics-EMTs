This allows the output voltage to be higher or lower than the input voltage, based on the duty cycle D. A typical
buck-boost converter topology is shown in Fig. 30.17(c). When the power device is turned on, the input provides
energy to the inductor and the diode is reverse biased. When the device is turned off, the energy stored in the
inductor  is  transferred  to  the  output.  No  energy  is  supplied  by  the  input  during  this  interval.  In  dc  power
supplies,  the  output  capacitor  is  assumed  to  be  very  large,  which  results  in  a  constant  output  voltage.  In  dc
drive  systems,  the  chopper  is  operated  in  step-down  mode  during  motoring  and  in  step-up  mode  during
regeneration operation.
