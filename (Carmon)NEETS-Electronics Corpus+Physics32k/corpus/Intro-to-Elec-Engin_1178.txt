the armature current ¯Ia is resolved into two components: Id in the direct or ﬁeld axis, and Iq in
the quadrature or interpolar axis. Iq will be in the time phase with the excitation speed voltage
¯Ef , whereas Id will be in time quadrature with ¯Ef . Direct- and quadrature-axis reactances (Xd
and Xq) are then introduced to model the machine in two axes. While this involved method of
analysis is not pursued here any further, the steady-state power-angle characteristic of a salient-
pole synchronous machine (with negligible armature resistance) is shown in Figure 13.3.4. The
resulting power has two terms: one due to ﬁeld excitation and the other due to saliency. The
maximum torque that can be developed is somewhat greater because of the contribution due to
saliency.
