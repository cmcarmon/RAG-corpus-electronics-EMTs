Figure 5.6 shows the RMS displacement responses of ﬁrst
(sx 1 ), second (sx 2 ), and third (sx 3 ) ﬂoor and the RMS velocity
responses of ﬁrst (sx 4 ), second (sx 5 ), and third (sx 6 ) ﬂoor,
respectively, versus the MCV parameter g. It is important to
note that both third ﬂoor RMS displacement and velocity
responses can be decreased by choosing large g.
