There are three important types of resistive  circuits: 
the series	circuit, the parallel	circuit, and the 
 series-parallel	 circuit (Figure 13‑18). A series 
 circuit provides a single path for current flow. A 
 parallel  circuit provides two or more paths for current 
flow. A series-parallel circuit is a combination of a se‑
ries  circuit and a parallel circuit.
