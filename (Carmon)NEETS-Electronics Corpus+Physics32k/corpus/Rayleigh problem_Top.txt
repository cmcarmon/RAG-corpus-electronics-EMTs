In fluid dynamics, Rayleigh problem also known as Stokes first problem is a problem of determining the flow created by a sudden movement of a plane from rest, named after Lord Rayleigh and Sir George Stokes. This is considered as one of the simplest unsteady problem that have exact solution for the Navier-Stokes equations.
