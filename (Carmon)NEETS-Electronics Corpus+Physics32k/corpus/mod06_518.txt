1-31. A triode electron tube is designed to 
conduct at 15 milliamperes of current 
when its grid is at 0 volts relative to its 
cathode. For every volt below this, 
conduction will decrease by 1.5 
milliamperes. If the tube is biased at âˆ’3 
volts and has a 6-volt peak-to-peak input 
signal, what is the minimum amount of 
current that will conduct through the 
tube?
