A dc voltage measurement can be made with an oscilloscope, as shown in figure 1-3, that has a
direct-coupled deflection amplifier or terminals for connection directly to the deflection plates of the
cathode-ray tube. Measuring a dc voltage with an oscilloscope is convenient only under certain
circumstances; for example, when other measurements are being made on the same equipment with the
oscilloscope or when a vacuum tube voltmeter is not available and a high-impedance measuring device is
required.
