5.  Change the pot setting to 10 kΩ and observe the change in current.
With your multimeter still inserted in your circuit, dial the pot all the 
way to the other end so that its resistance is 10 kΩ. What current read-
ing do you get? Is the actual current what you expected?
You should expect a current of roughly 0.82 mA because Rtotal is now 
11 kΩ and V
