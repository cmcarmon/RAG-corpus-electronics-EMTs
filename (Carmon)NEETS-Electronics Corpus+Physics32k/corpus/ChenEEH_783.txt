2. Experimental results on a voice coder (vocoder) algo-
rithm show that this technique is able to reduce the
total memory size signiÔ¨Åcantly and also reduce the
associated power consumption. Automation of this
technique has been demonstrated in a prototype tool
that is being developed into a mature compiler pro-
gram.
