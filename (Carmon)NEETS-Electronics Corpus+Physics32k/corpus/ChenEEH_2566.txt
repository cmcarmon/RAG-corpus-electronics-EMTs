A cavity resonator can be regarded as a section of metallic
waveguide including coaxial lines that is usually short-circuited
at both ends, thus forming a closed box or cavity. Electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are conﬁned in the structure, and currents
ﬂowing on the interior’s imperfect conducting walls cause
power dissipation. Electrical and/or magnetic coupling to this
type of resonator can be made through a small aperture or a
small loop or probe.
