We want to show that when we pass X(t) through a narrow bandpass ﬁlter with a bandwidth d centered at
the  frequency –f0,  the  expected  power  at  the  output  terminals,  divided  by  the  bandwidth  d,  is  SXX(f0)  in  the
limit as d ﬁ 0. This shows that SXX( f ) is a density function (whose area is the total expected power over all
frequencies, just as the area under a pdf is the total probability). This result that RXX(t) and SXX( f ) are a Fourier
transform pair is known as the Wiener-Khinchin relation [see Gardner, 1990, p. 230].
