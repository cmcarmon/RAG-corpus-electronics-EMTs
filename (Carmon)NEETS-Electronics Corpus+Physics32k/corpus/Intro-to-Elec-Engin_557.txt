as the counter gets incremented; when V2 is slightly greater than the analog input signal, the
comparator signal becomes low, thereby causing the AND gate to stop the counter. The counter
output at this point becomes the digital representation of the analog input signal. The relatively
long conversion time needed to encode the analog input signal is the major disadvantage of this
method.
