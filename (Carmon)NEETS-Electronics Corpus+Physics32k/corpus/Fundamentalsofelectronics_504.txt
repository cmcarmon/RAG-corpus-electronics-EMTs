(a) Find the spectrum of the jamming signal.
(b) Can KSRR entirely circumvent the attempt to jam it by carefully choosing its carrier frequency and
transmission bandwidth? If so, ﬁnd the station’s carrier frequency and transmission bandwidth in
terms of T , the period of the jamming signal; if not, show why not.
