Larger wheels typically cost more. Wider tires tend to be more expensive because they are less common, and there is less competition between brands.
Performance improvements beyond what is achieved in a Plus One sizing are often minimal.
Lower profile tires tend to have stiffer sidewalls, which might decrease riding comfort.
Low profile tires are likely to sustain more damage to tires and wheel rims when encountering road debris and potholes.
Larger and wider wheels decrease fuel efficiency and increase consumption. A test done on Volkswagen Golf 2.5 saw a 10% decrease in fuel efficiency from 23.3 mpg to 21.1 mpg in a Plus Four sizing.
Larger and wider wheels may also degrade acceleration on many everyday vehicles. The test done on a Volkswagen Golf 2.5 saw a 0.3 second degradation in 0-to-60 mph acceleration from 7.6 seconds to 7.9 seconds in a Plus Four sizing. Although, this is likely caused by the 14 lb weight difference, per corner, in "unpsprung weight".
A larger tire-footprint can increase the time taken for "return to center" (steering) after taking a sharp turn.
