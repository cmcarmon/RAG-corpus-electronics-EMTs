ki and kj are the projections of the wave vector k. When E(k)
depends only on the magnitude of k, and not on the k direc-
tion, this tensor reduces to a scalar inverse effective mass,
1=mn. This is the case for GaAs, where dependence of the
electron energy on the wave vector near the lowest point of
the conduction band can be approximated by the following
function:
