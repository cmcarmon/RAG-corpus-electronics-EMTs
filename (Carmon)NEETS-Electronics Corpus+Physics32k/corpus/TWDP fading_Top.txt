Two-Wave with Diffuse Power or TWDP is a model for predicting fading, an effect in radio propagation that causes a signal to be strengthened or weakened at certain locations or times. TWDP models fading due to the interference of two strong radio signals and numerous smaller, diffuse signals.
TWDP is a generalized system using a statistical model to produce results. Other statistical methods for predicting fading, including Rayleigh fading and Rician fading, can be considered as special cases of the TWDP model. The TWDP calculation produces a number of fading cases that the older models do not, especially in areas with crowded spectrums.
