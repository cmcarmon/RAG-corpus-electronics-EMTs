The sole purpose of launch lug is to provide stability for a model rocket prior to and during liftoff by forcing the rocket to remain parallel to the launch rod during the first seconds of flight, before significant velocities are reached and enough momentum is built up to maintain stability. At higher velocities, the fins act as the rocket's primary stabilizing devices.
