The response of a second-order system, specifically a parallel RLC system as
in Figure 14.1, to a brief pulse and to a step was calculated in Chapter 12. We
now wish to examine this same system from the impedance point of view, to
show how such circuits can be used as filters. In particular, we will discuss the
factors that affect the selectivity of the filter. To tie back to the calculations in
Chapter 12, let us first calculate the total time-domain response v(t), when the
