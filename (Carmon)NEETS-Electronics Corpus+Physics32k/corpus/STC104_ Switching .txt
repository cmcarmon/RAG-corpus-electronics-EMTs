The STC104 uses wormhole switching to reduce latency and the per-link buffering requirement. Wormhole switching works by splitting packets into fixed-size chunks (called flits) for transmission, allowing the packet to be pipelined in the network. The first header flit opens a route (or circuit) through each switch in the network, allowing subsequent flits to experience no switching delay. The final flit closes the route.
Since the header flit can proceed independently of the subsequent flits, the latency of the packet is independent of its size. Consequently, the amount of buffering provided by links can also be chosen independently of the packet size. Furthermore, the total buffering requirement is small since, typically, only a small number of flits need to be stored for each link. This is in contrast to store-and-forward switching, where a whole packet must be buffered at each link end point.
