One  of  the  major  reasons  for  the  development  of  H∞  control  is  that  many  performance  and  robustness
criteria for MIMO systems involve the maximum singular value of certain system transfer functions. To optimize
the performance or robustness of these systems requires the minimization of the maximum singular value of
these transfer functions, which is exactly the objective of H∞ control.
