Sinusoidal waveforms (single-channel operation) 
 
The procedure for displaying a repetitive sine wave 
waveform  is  shown  in  Fig.  14.27.  The  signal  is 
connected to the Channel 1 input (with ‘AC’ input 
selected)  and  the  mode  switch  in  the  Channel  1 
position. ‘Channel 1’ must be selected as the trigger 
source  and  the  trigger  level  control  adjusted  for  a 
stable  display.  Where  accurate  measurements  are 
required  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the  ‘Cal’ 
position  is  selected  for  both  the  variable  gain  and 
time controls.
