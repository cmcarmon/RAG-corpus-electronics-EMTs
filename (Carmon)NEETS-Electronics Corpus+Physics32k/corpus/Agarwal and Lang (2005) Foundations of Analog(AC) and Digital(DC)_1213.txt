p r o b l e m 8.6 Consider the MOSFET-based amplifier circuit discussed in
Problem 7.8 (Figure 7.79). Assuming an input bias point voltage VI, draw the small-
signal circuit equivalent of the amplifier. Determine the small-signal gain of the amplifier.
Assume throughout that the MOSFET operates in its saturation region.
p r o b l e m 8.7 Consider again the amplifier circuit discussed in Problem 7.8
(Figure 7.79). Suppose that the amplifier is biased such that vI = vO at the bias point.
Draw the small-signal circuit equivalent of the amplifier assuming this bias point. Deter-
mine the small-signal gain of the amplifier at this bias point. Assume that the MOSFET
operates in its saturation region.
p r o b l e m 8.8 Consider the common gate amplifier circuit shown in Figure 7.82,
and analyzed earlier in Problem 7.11. Assume that the MOSFET operates in its saturation
region, and is characterized by the parameters VT and K.
