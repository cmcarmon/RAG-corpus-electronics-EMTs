The generalization applies equally to sets of multiple objects, as long as they are in the same plane or parallel planes. The measures of the objects in such a set can be added together and essentially treated as a single object. The multiple line-segment animation illustrates the generalization applied to a set of three one-dimensional objects in three dimensions of space. In this case, two sequential line segments exist in parallel to a third line segment. Because lines are one-dimensional, the coordinate subspaces onto which they are projected must also be one-dimensional. Thus, projections appear on the coordinate axes rather than on the coordinate planes. The lengths of the projected line segments on a given axis are summed, then squared, then added to the total lengths squared on the other axes. The result is the squared sum of the lengths of the original line segments. For the sake of simplicity, when projections are single points of zero length, they are not shown, since they do not affect the calculations.

The generalization applies to flat objects of any shape, regular or irregular. The multi-object animation illustrates the use of the generalization on a set of several different objects in different planes â€“ in this case, a triangle and a circle on one plane, and a flat cat on a parallel plane (shown in blue). Projections of the set are shown in green on the coordinate plane subspaces. Objects shown initially upright in the yz-plane are subsequently tilted in parallel. Again, regardless of set orientation, the result remains the same. On each coordinate plane subspace, the areas of object projections are calculated individually (to avoid miscalculations due to projection overlap), then added together to produce the total projection area of the set on that plane. The projection set area is then squared for each coordinate plane. The sum of all projection set areas squared is always equal to the original set area squared.
