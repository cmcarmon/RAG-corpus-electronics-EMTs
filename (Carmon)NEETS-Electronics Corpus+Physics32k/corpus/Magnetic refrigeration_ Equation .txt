{\displaystyle \Delta T_{ad}=-\int _{H_{0}}^{H_{1}}{\Bigg (}{\frac {T}{C(T,H)}}{\Bigg )}_{H}{{\Bigg (}{\frac {\partial M(T,H)}{\partial T}}{\Bigg )}}_{H}dH}

where T is the temperature, H is the applied magnetic field, C is the heat capacity of the working magnet (refrigerant) and M is the magnetization of the refrigerant.
From the equation we can see that magnetocaloric effect can be enhanced by:
applying a large field
using a magnet with a small heat capacity
using a magnet with a large change in magnetization vs. temperature, at a constant magnetic field
