The displacement thickness, δ* or δ1 is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved in the direction perpendicular to its normal vector away from the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
to give the same flow rate as occurs between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.
In practical aerodynamics, the displacement thickness essentially modifies the shape of a body immersed in a fluid to allow an inviscid solution. It is commonly used in aerodynamics to overcome the difficulty inherent in the fact that the fluid velocity in the boundary layer approaches asymptotically to the free stream value as distance from the wall increases at any given location.
The definition of the displacement thickness for compressible flow is based on mass flow rate:

{\displaystyle {\delta ^{*}}=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\left(1-{\rho (y)u(y) \over \rho _{0}u_{0}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} y}}

The definition for incompressible flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

{\displaystyle {\delta ^{*}}=\int _{0}^{\infty }{\left(1-{u(y) \over u_{0}}\right)\,\mathrm {d} y}}

where




ρ

0




{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and



y


{\displaystyle y}
is the coordinate normal to the wall.
For turbulent boundary layer calculations, the time averaged density and velocity at the edge of the boundary layer must be used. In the equations above,




ρ

0




{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
are therefore replaced with




ρ

e




{\displaystyle \rho _{e}}
and




u

{\displaystyle u_{e}}
.
The displacement thickness is used to calculate the boundary layer's shape factor.
