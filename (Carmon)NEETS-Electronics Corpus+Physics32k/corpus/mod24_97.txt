When a light wave passes from one medium into a medium having a different velocity of
propagation (the speed waves can travel through a medium), a change in the direction of the wave will
occur. This change of direction as the wave enters the second medium is called refraction. As in the
discussion of reflection, the wave striking the boundary (surface) is called the incident wave, and the
imaginary line perpendicular to the boundary is called the normal. The angle between the incident wave
and the normal is called the angle of incidence. As the wave passes through the boundary, it is bent either
toward or away from the normal. The angle between the normal and the path of the wave through the
second medium is the angle of refraction.
