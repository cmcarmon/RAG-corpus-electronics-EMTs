Design Tools
Environmental design tools vary widely in the evaluation procedures offered in terms of the type of data used,
method of analysis, and the results provided to the electronic designer. The tool strategies range in scope from
assessment of the entire product life cycle to the evaluation of a single aspect of its fabrication, use, or disposal.
Today’s DFE tools can be generally characterized as either life cycle analysis, recyclability analysis, manufacturing
analysis, or process ﬂow analysis tools.
