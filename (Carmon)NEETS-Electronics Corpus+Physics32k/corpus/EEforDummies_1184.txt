If your multimeter has a capacitor‚Äêtesting feature, it will display the value of 
the capacitor. This can come in handy because not all capacitors follow the 
industry standard identification scheme. Refer to your multimeter manual 
for the exact procedure because the specifics vary from model to model. Be 
sure to observe the proper polarity when connecting the capacitor to the test 
points on the meter.
