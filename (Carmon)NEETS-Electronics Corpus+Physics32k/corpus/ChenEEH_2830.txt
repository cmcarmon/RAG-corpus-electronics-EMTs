Scanning Electron Microscope Image of a Prototype
Photonic Integrated Circuit. The photonic circuit is comprised of 5.0-
mm diameter AlGaAs microcavity disk resonators coupled to 0.3-mm-
wide AlGaAs optical waveguides across air gaps spanning as little as
0:1 mm. Courtesy of Prof. S.-T. Ho, Northwestern University.
