When a transition metal ion of configuration




d

n




{\displaystyle d^{n}}
,



n
=
4


{\displaystyle n=4}
to



7


{\displaystyle 7}
, is in octahedral surroundings, its ground state may be low spin (LS) or high spin (HS), depending to a first approximation on the magnitude of the



Δ


{\displaystyle \Delta }
energy gap between




e

g




{\displaystyle e_{g}}
and




t

2
g




{\displaystyle t_{2g}}
metal orbitals relative to the mean spin pairing energy



P


{\displaystyle P}
(see Crystal field theory). More precisely, for



Δ
>>
P


{\displaystyle \Delta >>P}
, the ground state arises from the configuration where the



d


{\displaystyle d}
electrons occupy first the




t

2
g




{\displaystyle t_{2g}}
orbitals of lower energy, and if there are more than six electrons, the




e

g




{\displaystyle e_{g}}
orbitals of higher energy. The ground state is then LS. On the other hand, for



Δ
<<
P


{\displaystyle \Delta <<P}
, Hund's rule is obeyed. The HS ground state has got the same multiplicity as the free metal ion. If the values of



P


{\displaystyle P}
and



Δ


{\displaystyle \Delta }
are comparable, a LS↔HS transition may occur.
