Equally Spaced Linear Arrays
An important special case occurs when the array elements are identical and are arranged on a straight line with
equal element spacing, d, as shown in Fig. 38.4. If a linear phase progression, a, is assumed for the excitation
currents of the elements, then the total Ô¨Åeld at position P in Fig. 38.4 will be
