If dw/dq is positive, point a is at the higher potential. The voltage between two points is the
work per unit positive charge required to move that charge between the two points. If dw and dq
have the same sign, then energy is delivered by a positive charge going from a to b (or a negative
charge going the other way). Conversely, charged particles gain energy inside a source where dw
and dq have opposite polarities.
