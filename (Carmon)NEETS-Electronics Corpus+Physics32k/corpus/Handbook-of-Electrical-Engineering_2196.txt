MATLAB gives us a number of different options for designing both IIR and FIR digital ﬁlters. We can design
classical IIR ﬁlters (Butterworth, Chebyshev type I, Chebyshev type II, and elliptic) that are lowpass, highpass,
bandpass, or bandstop ﬁlters. We can also use other techniques, such as the Yule-Walker technique, to design
IIR  ﬁlters  with  arbitrary  passbands.  Several  techniques  allow  us  to  design  FIR  ﬁlters  using  windowed  least
squares techniques. The Parks-McClellan algorithm uses the Remez exchange algorithm to design ﬁlters with
