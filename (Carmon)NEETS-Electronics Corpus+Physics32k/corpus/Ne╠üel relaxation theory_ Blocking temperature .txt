Suppose that the magnetization of a single superparamagnetic nanoparticle is measured over a time τm. If this time is much greater than the relaxation time τN, the nanoparticle magnetization will flip several times during the measurement. In zero field, the measured magnetization will average to zero. If τm ≪ τN, the magnetization will not flip during the measurement, so the measured magnetization will be equal to the initial magnetization. In the former case, the nanoparticle will appear to be in the superparamagnetic state whereas in the latter case it will be blocked in its initial state. The state of the nanoparticle (superparamagnetic or blocked) depends on the measurement time. A transition between superparamagnetism and the blocked state occurs when τm = τN. In several experiments, the measurement time is kept constant but the temperature is varied, so the transition between superparamagnetism and blocked state is a function of the temperature. The temperature for which τm = τN is called the blocking temperature:

For typical laboratory measurements, the value of the logarithm in the previous equation is in the order of 20–25.
