FIGURE 6.2 Examples of a Power Radiation Pattern Pd, are Plotted
in Rectangular and Polar Forms as a Function of u for a Fixed Value of
f ¼ f0. The half-power beam width (HPBW), ﬁrst-null beam width
(FNBW), side lobe level (SLL), and back lobe level (BLL) are shown,
indicating the main lobe, side lobe, and back lobe of radiation.
