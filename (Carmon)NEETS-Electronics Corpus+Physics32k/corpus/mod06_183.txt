At time c, the input has reached its maximum positive value of +3 volts. This will decrease grid
voltage to -3 volts (-6 volts + 3 volts). This is shown on the grid voltage waveform at time c. This in turn
will increase the electrostatic force between the plate and cathode. More electrons will then flow from the
