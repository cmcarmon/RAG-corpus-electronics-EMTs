Oscillator circuits that are 1-port use diodes, commonly the
Gunn diode, to provide negative resistance for oscillation.
A typical circuit for a 1-port negative resistance oscillator is
shown in Figure 11.10. The frequency-dependant input im-
pedance of the active device is Zin(v), with real and imaginary
components Rin(v) and Xin(v). Note that Zin is also typically a
function of the bias voltage and current. Applying Kirchhoff â€™s
voltage law gives:
