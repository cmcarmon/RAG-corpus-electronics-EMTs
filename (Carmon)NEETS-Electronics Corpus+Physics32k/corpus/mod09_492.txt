Linearity of the trapezoidal waveform, produced by the circuit in figure 3-50, view (A) and view (B) 
depends on two factors, gate length and the time constant of the RC circuit. Recall that these are the same 
factors that controlled linearity in the sawtooth generator. The formula developed earlier still remains true 
and enables us to determine what effect these factors have on linearity.
