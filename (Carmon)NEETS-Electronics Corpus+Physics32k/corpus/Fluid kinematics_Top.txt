Fluid kinematics is a field of physics and mechanics concerned with the movement of fluids. Fluids tend to flow easily, which causes a net motion of molecules from one point in space to another point as a function of time. These fluids may be liquids or may be materials with fluid properties, including crowds of people or volumes of grains.
Using the continuum hypothesis, fluids are classified into fluid particles, which are composed of numerous fluid molecules. These particles interact with one another and with the surroundings they are in. Using a Eulerian model (the continuum hypothesis), fluid motion can be described in terms of acceleration or velocity.
