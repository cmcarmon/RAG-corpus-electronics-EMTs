A substantial increase in bandwidth for this type of coupler
is made possible by replacing the 3l=4-section of the original
ring geometry by a shorted l=4 parallel coupled-line section as
shown in Figure 7.19(B). In this case, the ring is reduced to one
wavelength, and its bandwidth can be increased by roughly
one octave. The effective bandwidth of ring-based hybrids
can be further extended by using a generalized design theory
developed by Wang and Wu (1999) that requires a small
modiÔ¨Åcation of the impedance ratio of the ring with respect
to the externally connected branch lines. In addition, innova-
tive structures can be found in the literature for the design of a
3-dB coupler on the basis of some bandwidth-broadening and
size-reduced schemes, such as microstrip disc or waveguide
cavity geometry.
