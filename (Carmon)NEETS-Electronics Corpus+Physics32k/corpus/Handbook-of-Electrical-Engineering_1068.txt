where s[n] = s(t)|t = nT . This demonstrates that the spectrum of sa(t) as calculated by the CT Fourier transform
is  identical  to  the  spectrum  of  s[n]  as  calculated  by  the  DTFT.  Therefore,  although  sa(t)  and  s[n]  are  quite
different sampling models, they are equivalent in the sense that they have the same Fourier domain represen-
tation. A list of common DTFT pairs is presented in Table 14.3. Just as the CT Fourier transform is useful in
CT signal system analysis and design, the DTFT is equally useful for DT system analysis and design.
