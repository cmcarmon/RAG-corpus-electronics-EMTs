Ideal Sources
The ideal independent voltage source shown in Fig. 2.7 constrains the terminal voltage across the element to a
prescribed function of time, vS(t), as v(t) = vS(t). The polarity of the source is denoted by â€“ signs within the
circle which denotes this as an ideal independent source. Controlled or dependent ideal voltage sources will be
discussed in Section 2.3. The current through the element will be determined by the circuit that is attached to
the terminals of this source.
