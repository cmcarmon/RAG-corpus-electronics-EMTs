Liquids should be administered sparingly, and not at all if medical attention will be available within 
a short time. If necessary, small amounts of warm water, tea, or coffee may be given to a victim who is 
conscious. Persons having serious burns are an exception. Burn victims require large amounts of fluids. 
Water, tea, fruit juices, and sugar water may be given freely to a victim who is conscious, able to 
swallow, and has no internal injuries. Slightly salted water is also beneficial. Alcohol must never be given 
to a person in shock.
