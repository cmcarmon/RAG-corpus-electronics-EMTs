Static Magnetic Fields
To understand the phenomenon of magnetism we must also consider electricity and vice versa. A stationary
electric charge produces, at a point a ﬁxed distance from the charge, a static (i.e., time-invariant) electric ﬁeld.
A  moving  electric  charge,  i.e.,  a  current,  produces  at  the  same  point  a  time-dependent  electric  ﬁeld  and  a
H
I
, represented by the moving electric
magnetic ﬁeld, d
charge, is constant.
