Organizing all your parts
Keeping all these parts and components organized is essential — unless 
you’re the type who enjoys sorting through junk drawers looking for some 
tiny, yet important, item. An easy way to get it together is to run over to your 
local big‐box discount store and purchase one or more sets of clear‐plastic 
drawer organizers. Be sure to spray the plastic boxes with an antistatic ESD 
(electrostatic discharge) spray, which you can find on Amazon.com. Then 
label each drawer for a particular component (or group of components, such 
as LEDs, 10–99 Ω resistors, and so forth). You’ll know in a glance where every-
thing is and be able to see when your stock is getting low.
