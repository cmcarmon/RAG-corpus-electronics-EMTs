In the calculation of the Stokes' law for the drag that a viscous fluid exerts on a small spherical particle, the velocity distribution obeys Navier-Stokes equations neglecting inertia, i.e.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =-\mathbf {U} _{0}\quad (r\to \infty )}

being U the relative velocity of the particle to the fluid far from the particle. In spherical coordinates this velocity at infinity can be written as

Substitution in the Navier-Stokes equations produces a set of ordinary differential equations for the coefficients.
