We know from resistive circuits that the series-parallel combination is a
powerful tool for reducing circuits. This technique can be extended to
series-parallel connections of capacitors, which are sometimes encoun-
tered.  We  desire  to  replace  these  capacitors  by  a  single  equivalent
capacitor
