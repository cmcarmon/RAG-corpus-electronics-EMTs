A magnetic sail of an interstellar craft needs to brake from the protons of the interstellar medium. The density

{\displaystyle n_{p}}
of protons is very low, of the order of 0.3 atoms per cubic centimeter for the Local Interstellar Cloud, which reaches up to a distance of 30 light years from the sun, and of the order for
