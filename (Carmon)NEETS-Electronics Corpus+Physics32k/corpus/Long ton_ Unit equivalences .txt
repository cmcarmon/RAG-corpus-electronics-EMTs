A long ton, also called the weight ton (W/T) is equal to 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg), coincidentally equivalent to the mass of 35 cubic feet (0.99 m3) of salt water with a density of 64 pounds per cubic foot (1.03 g/cm3). One long ton is 1.12 short tons or 12% larger than the 2,000 pounds of the North American short ton. A long ton is approximately 1.0160 tonnes (metric tons).
It has some limited use in the United States, most commonly in measuring the displacement of ships, the volume-to-carrying-weight of fuels and in trade of baled commodities and bulk goods like elemental sulfur. The long ton was the unit prescribed for warships by the Washington Naval Treaty 1922â€”for example battleships were limited to a displacement of 35,000 long tons (36,000 t; 39,000 short tons).
To comply with the practices of the European Union, the British Imperial ton was explicitly excluded from use for trade by the United Kingdom's Weights and Measures Act of 1985.
