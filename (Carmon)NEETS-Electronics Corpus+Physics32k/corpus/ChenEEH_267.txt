Figures 1.34(A) and 1.34(B) show the efﬁciencies of the
push-pull forward converter under 12 V and 48 V input volt-
ages, respectively. For a 12-V input, this converter can achieve
81% efﬁciency at an output of 1.2 V at 60 A. For a 48-V input,
this converter can achieve 83.6% efﬁciency at an output of
1.2 V at 60 A.
