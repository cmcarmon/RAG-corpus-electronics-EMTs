An electrodynamic movement uses the same basic operating principle as the basic moving-coil meter
movement, except that the permanent magnet is replaced by fixed coils (fig. 1-15). A moving coil, to
which the meter pointer is attached, is suspended between two field coils and connected in series with
these coils. The three coils (two field coils and the moving coil) are connected in series across the meter
terminals so that the same current flows through each.
