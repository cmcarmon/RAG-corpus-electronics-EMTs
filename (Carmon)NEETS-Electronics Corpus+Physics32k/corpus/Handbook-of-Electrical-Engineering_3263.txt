There  are  many  possible  reasons  why  certain  lasers  do  not  Ô¨Ånd  their  way  onto  the  market.  Some  require
exotic operating conditions or laser media, such as high temperatures or highly reactive metal vapors. Some
emit only feeble powers. Others have only limited applications, particularly lasers emitting low powers in the
far-infrared  or  in  parts  of  the  infrared  where  the  atmosphere  is  opaque.  Some  simply  cannot  compete  with
materials already on the market.
