analog output voltage as a fraction of the reference
voltage.
*6.2.37 Consider the 4-bit R–2R ladder D/A converter
with Vref = −10 V. Determine the analog output
voltage when the binary input code is 1100. Also,
ﬁnd what reference voltage is to be used in order to
obtain the corresponding decimal output voltage.
6.2.38 For a 10-bit R–2R ladder-network D/A converter
with an MSB resistor value of 10 k, what is the
value of the LSB resistor?
