As the electric ﬁeld is established by the applied voltage, extra free electrons are forced to
collect on the negative conductor, while free electrons are ”robbed” from the positive conductor.
This differential charge equates to a storage of energy in the capacitor, representing the poten-
tial charge of the electrons between the two plates. The greater the difference of electrons on
opposing plates of a capacitor, the greater the ﬁeld ﬂux, and the greater ”charge” of energy the
capacitor will store.
