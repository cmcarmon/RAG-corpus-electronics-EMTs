Various regions of the curve can be identiﬁed: the linear region of forward-biasing, a
non-linear transition region, a turn-on voltage (VP N ) and a reverse-biased region. We can
assign a dynamic resistance to the diode in each of the linear regions: Rf in the forward-
biased region and Rr in the reverse-biased region. These resistances are deﬁned as the inverse
slope of the curve: 1/R = ∆I/∆V . The voltage VP N , represents the eﬀective voltage drop
across a forward-biased PN junction (the turn-on voltage). For a germanium diode, VP N is
approximately 0.3 V, while for a silicon diode it is close to 0.6 V.
