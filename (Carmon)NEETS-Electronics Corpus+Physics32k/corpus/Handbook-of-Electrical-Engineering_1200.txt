This theorem indicates that repeated applications of operator T converge to the required orthogonal projection
operator PC . The practicality of this result arises from the observation that it is often possible to synthesize the
individual orthogonal projection operators Pk but not the composite orthogonal projection operator PC. This
capability was illustrated in Theorem 2 for the case in which the subspaces were Ô¨Ånite dimensional. To solve
