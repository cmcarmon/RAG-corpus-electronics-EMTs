When an ac meter is used to measure the voltages and currents along a line, the polarity is not
indicated. If you plot all the current and voltage readings along the length of the line, you will get curves
like the ones shown in figure 3-28. Notice that all are positive. These curves are the conventional method
of showing current and voltage standing waves on rf lines.
