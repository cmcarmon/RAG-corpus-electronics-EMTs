The setup for performing insertion loss or attenuation measurements is shown in figure 4-5. It
requires that you initially establish a convenient reference on the DB scale of the meter. This is
accomplished by connecting the signal source directly to the detector and using the GAIN and VERNIER
controls to adjust the meter pointer to a convenient reference. Then you can insert the device to be
measured between the signal source and the detector and note the change in dB, as shown on the meter.
