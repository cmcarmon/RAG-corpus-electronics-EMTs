A useful circuit for isolating one electrical system from another is the voltage
follower shown in Figure 15.10. Comparison with Figure 15.4a indicates that
this circuit is a degenerate case of the non-inverting connection, in which R1 = 0
and R2 = âˆž. Hence, from Equation 15.9, the input-output relation for the
follower is
