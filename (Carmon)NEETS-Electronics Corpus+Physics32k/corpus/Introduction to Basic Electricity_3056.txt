The diode symbol is shown in Figure 29-5. The P 
section is represented by an arrow, and the N section 
by a bar. Forward current flows from the N sectionÂ to  
the P section (against the arrow). The N section is 
called the cathode, and the P section is called the 
 anode. The cathode supplies and the anode collects 
the electrons.
