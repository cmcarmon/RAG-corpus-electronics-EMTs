In metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) devices, the semiconductor surface is passivated by thermally growing a silicon
dioxide,  SiO2,  ﬁlm  (about  5000  Å)  with  the  semiconductor  silicon  wafer  exposed  to  an  oxygen  ambient  at
1200(cid:176)C. The resulting SiO2 dielectric ﬁlm has good adhesion properties, but due to its open glassy structure is
not impervious to ionic impurities (primarily sodium). Accordingly, a denser ﬁlm structure of silicon nitride,
Si3N4,  is  formed  in  a  reaction  between  silane  and  ammonia  and  is  pyrolytically  deposited  on  the  SiO2  layer.
