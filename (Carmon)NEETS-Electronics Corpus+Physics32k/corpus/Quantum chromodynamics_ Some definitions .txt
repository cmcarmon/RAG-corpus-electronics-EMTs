Every field theory of particle physics is based on certain symmetries of nature whose existence is deduced from observations. These can be
local symmetries, that are the symmetries that act independently at each point in spacetime. Each such symmetry is the basis of a gauge theory and requires the introduction of its own gauge bosons.
global symmetries, which are symmetries whose operations must be simultaneously applied to all points of spacetime.
QCD is a gauge theory of the SU(3) gauge group obtained by taking the color charge to define a local symmetry.
Since the strong interaction does not discriminate between different flavors of quark, QCD has approximate flavor symmetry, which is broken by the differing masses of the quarks.
There are additional global symmetries whose definitions require the notion of chirality, discrimination between left and right-handed. If the spin of a particle has a positive projection on its direction of motion then it is called left-handed; otherwise, it is right-handed. Chirality and handedness are not the same, but become approximately equivalent at high energies.
Chiral symmetries involve independent transformations of these two types of particle.
Vector symmetries (also called diagonal symmetries) mean the same transformation is applied on the two chiralities.
Axial symmetries are those in which one transformation is applied on left-handed particles and the inverse on the right-handed particles.
