The 250DE+1325 is a typical resistance, capacitance, inductance (rcl) bridge. Like the vtvm, the rcl
bridge has several disadvantages. It requires ac power and a lengthy warm-up period, and its accuracy is
limited to â€“ 2%. The rcl bridge uses a tuning indicator electron tube, commonly referred to as the bridge's
"eye," and an internal arrangement of resistors that form a Wheatstone bridge. As discussed in NEETS,
module 16, the rcl bridge can be a time-consuming method of performing resistance measurements.
