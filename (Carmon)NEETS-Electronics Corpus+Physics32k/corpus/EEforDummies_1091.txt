Sometimes called solderable breadboards, these perfboards enable you to 
transfer your circuit from a solderless breadboard to a perfboard easily 
because you don’t have to alter the layout. You simply pick the parts off your 
solderless breadboard, insert them in the corresponding perfboard holes, 
solder their leads to the copper pads, and trim the leads. You use insulated 
wires in the same way you did in the original solderless breadboard: to con-
nect components that aren’t already electrically connected by the metal 
strips of the perfboard, soldering them into place. The drawback of using sol-
derable breadboards is that they waste space.
