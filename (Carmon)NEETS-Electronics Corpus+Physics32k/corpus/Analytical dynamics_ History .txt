The field has a long and important history, as remarked by Hamilton: "The theoretical development of the laws of motion of bodies is a problem of such interest and importance that it has engaged the attention of all the eminent mathematicians since the invention of the dynamics as a mathematical science by Galileo, and especially since the wonderful extension which was given to that science by Newton." William Rowan Hamilton, 1834 (Transcribed in Classical Mechanics by J.R. Taylor, p. 237)
Some authors (for example, Taylor (2005) and Greenwood (1997)) include special relativity within classical dynamics.
