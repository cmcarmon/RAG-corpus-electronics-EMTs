Source-to-fiber coupling efficiency is a measure of the relevant optical power. The coupling
efficiency depends on the type of fiber that is attached to the optical source. Coupling efficiency also
depends on the coupling technique. Source-to-fiber coupling involves centering a flat fiber-end face over
