The virtual memory can be thought of as a collection of blocks. These blocks are often aligned and of ﬁxed
size, in which case they are known as pages. Pages are the unit of transfer between the disk and main memory,
and are generally larger than a cache line—usually thousands of bytes. A typical page size for machines in 1997
is  4  Kbyte. A  page’s  virtual  address  can  be  broken  into  two  parts,  a  virtual  page  number  and  an  offset.  The
page number speciﬁes the page to be accessed, and the page offset indicates the distance from the beginning
of the page to the indicated address.
