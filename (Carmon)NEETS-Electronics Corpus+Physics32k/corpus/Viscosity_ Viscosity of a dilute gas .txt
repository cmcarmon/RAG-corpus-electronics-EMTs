The Chapman–Enskog equation may be used to estimate viscosity for a dilute gas. This equation is based on a semi-theoretical assumption by Chapman and Enskog. The equation requires three empirically determined parameters: the collision diameter (σ), the maximum energy of attraction divided by the Boltzmann constant (ε/к) and the collision integral (ω(T*)).

T* = κT/ε is reduced temperature (dimensionless),
μ0 is viscosity for dilute gas (μPa·s),
M is molecular mass (g/mol),
T is temperature (K),
σ is the collision diameter (Å),
ε/к is the maximum energy of attraction divided by the Boltzmann constant (K),
ωμ is the collision integral.
