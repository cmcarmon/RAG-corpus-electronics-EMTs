At time 1 (T1), the sine waves applied to both vertical-deflection plates are at their null points, or
zero volts. As a result, electron 1 is not vertically deflected and strikes the CRT at its vertical center. At
time 2 (T2), the sine wave applied to the top plate is at its maximum negative value. This repels electron 2
toward the bottom of the CRT. At the same time, the sine wave applied to the bottom plate is at the most
positive value, causing electron 2 to be attracted even further toward the bottom of the CRT. Remember,
the beam is also being moved to the left. As a result, electron 2 strikes the CRT face to the right of and
below electron 1. At time 3 (T3), both sine waves applied to the vertical-deflection plates are again at the
null point, or zero volts. Therefore, there is no vertical deflection and electron 3 strikes the CRT face in
