Optical switches can be realized using a number of different waveguide, electrode, and substrate orientations.
Two  different  designs  are  used  in  commercially  available  optical  switches:  the  balanced-bridge  and  the  Db
directional coupler. The balanced-bridge design is similar to that of the Machâ€“Zehnder interferometer, except
that the Y-junctions have been replaced by 3-dB directional couplers as shown in Fig. 31.22.
