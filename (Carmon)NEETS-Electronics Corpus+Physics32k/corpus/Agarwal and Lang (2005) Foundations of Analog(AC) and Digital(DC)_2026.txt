We will now take a closer look at the resonant region of the frequency response
in Figure 14.6 where there are sharp transitions in the magnitude and phase. In
particular, we would like to determine the width of the resonant peak and the
factors that affect its sharpness.
To obtain some indication of the width of the resonance in Figure 14.6, two
points that are easy to calculate are the frequencies where |H( jω)| is down to
2) of its maximum value.2 These frequencies ω0.707 can be readily
0.707 (or 1/
