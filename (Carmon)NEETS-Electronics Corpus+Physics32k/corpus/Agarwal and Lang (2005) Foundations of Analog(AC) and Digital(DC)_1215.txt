f) Determine the small-signal input resistance of the amplifier. That is, determine the
equivalent resistance of the amplifier at the input port of its small-signal model.
Is the small-signal input resistance greater than, less than, or equal to that of the
‘‘common source’’ amplifier shown in Figure 8.50?
