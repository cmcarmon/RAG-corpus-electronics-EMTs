Focusing by the Objective Lens
The collimated and circularized beam of the diode laser
is  focused  on  the  surface  of  the  disk  using  an  objective
lens.  The  objective  is  designed  to  be  aberration-free,  so
that its focused spot size is limited only by the effects of
diffraction. Figure 80.25(a) shows the design of a typical
objective  made  from  spherical  optics.  According  to  the
classical theory of diffraction, the diameter of the beam,
d, at the objectiveâ€™s focal plane is given by
