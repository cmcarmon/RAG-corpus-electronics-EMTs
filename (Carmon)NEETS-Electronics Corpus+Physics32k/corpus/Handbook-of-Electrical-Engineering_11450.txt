Improvements in material quality can be expected to further improve the performance of thick detectors.
While the area of single crystal detectors is limited currently to a few square centimeters, electronics have been
developed to facilitate the operation of large arrays of single-crystal detectors and thus achieve high detection
efﬁciency. Multiple CZT detector arrays 20 × 20 cm have been produced using such technology.
