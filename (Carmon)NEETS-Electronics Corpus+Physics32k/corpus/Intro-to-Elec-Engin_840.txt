For a case with lagging power factor, Figure 10.2.1(a) shows voltage and current phasors;
Figure 10.2.1(b) depicts the real, reactive, and apparent powers; and Figure 10.2.1(c) gives the
power triangle. The corresponding diagrams with leading power factor are shown in Figure
10.2.2. Loads on the electric power system are generally inductive, which will cause the phase
current to lag the corresponding applied phase voltage. The real power component represents
the components of voltage and current that are in phase, whereas the reactive power component
represents the components of voltage and current that are in quadrature (that is, 90° out of phase).
The convention used for positive power ﬂow is described with the help of Figure 10.2.3, in
which Figure 10.2.3 (a) applies to a generator (source), and Figure 10.2.3 (b) applies to a load
(sink).
