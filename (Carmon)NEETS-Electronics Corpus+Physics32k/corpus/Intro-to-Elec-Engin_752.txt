In recent years, the conventional electric ignition system has been replaced by electronic
ignition. Mechanically operated switches, or the so-called points, have been replaced by bipolar
junction transistors (BJTs). The advantages of transistorized ignition systems over the conven-
tional mechanical ones are their greater reliability, durability, and ease of control. The transistor
cycles between saturation (state in which it behaves as a closed switch) and cutoff (state in
which it behaves as an open switch). The ignition spark is produced as a result of rapidly
switching off current through the coil. Modern engine control systems employ electric sensors
to determine operating conditions, electronic circuits to process the sensor signals, and special-
purpose computers to compute the optimum ignition timing.
