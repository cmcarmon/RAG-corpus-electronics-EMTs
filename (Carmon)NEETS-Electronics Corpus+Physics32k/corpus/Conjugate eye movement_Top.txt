Conjugate eye movement refers to motor coordination of the eyes that allows for bilateral fixation on a single object. Several centers in the brainstem are involved. Horizontal conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and CN VI, the paramedian pontine reticular formation, and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi-medial vestibular nucleus. Vertical conjugate gaze is controlled by the nuclei of CN III and CN IV, the rostral interstitial nucleus of medial longitudinal fasciculus (riMLF), and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal.
