The solder used should be 63/37 or a silver bear-
ing solder of 62/36/2 with a diameter of 0.020 inch 
to 0.015 inch. A noncorrosive liquid flux with a drop 
dispenser and a light-duty spray defluxer is required 
for applying and cleaning flux on the SMT leads. 
Clear tape is useful for taping down components be-
fore soldering.
