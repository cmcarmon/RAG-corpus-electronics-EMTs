To explain the relationship between the meter readings and the range switch setting, let’s use an
example. Suppose you have a 2,400-ohm resistor, which you have identified by the resistor color code.
With the range switch in the R ·  1 position, you connect the meter across the resistor. The meter point
then deflects between 200 and the point labeled with the infinity symbol ( ¥ ) on the extreme left side of
the scale. Because the R ·  1 range is selected, you multiply the reading by 1. Obviously, the scale reading
is not accurate enough. Therefore, you move the range selector switch to the next higher scale position (R
·  100) to obtain a more easily read value.
