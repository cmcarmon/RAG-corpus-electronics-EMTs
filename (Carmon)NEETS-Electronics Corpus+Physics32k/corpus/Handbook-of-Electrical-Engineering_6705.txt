As we have mentioned previously, there is really no requirement that the physical media between two adjacent
data  link  layers  be  composed  of  a  single  link.  In  fact,  if  a  path  through  the  network  is  initially  established
between two data link entities, there is no reason that DLC protocols need to be executed at intermediate nodes.
Figure  72.7,  adapted  from  Bhargava  and  Hluchyj  [1990]  shows  how  the  end-to-end  connection  might  be
implemented. A network implemented in the fashion indicated in Fig. 72.7 is called a fast packet network (FPN).
From  Fig.  72.7,  it  is  seen  that  the  data  link  layer  is  partitioned  into  three  sublayers:  the  data  link  control
sublayer (which parallels the LLC layer of LANs), the fast packet adaption (FPA) sublayer, and the fast packet
relay  (FPR)  sublayer.  The  function  of  the  fast  packet  adaption  sublayer  is  to  segment  the  layer-2  PDU,  the
frame, into smaller units, called fast packets, for transmission over the FPN. These fast packets contain infor-
mation that identiÔ¨Åes the source and destination node names and the frame to which they belong so that they
can be routed through the network and reassembled at the destination.
