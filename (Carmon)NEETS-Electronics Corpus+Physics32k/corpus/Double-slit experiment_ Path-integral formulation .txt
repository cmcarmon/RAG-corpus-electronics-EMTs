The Copenhagen interpretation is similar to the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics provided by Feynman. The path integral formulation replaces the classical notion of a single, unique trajectory for a system, with a sum over all possible trajectories. The trajectories are added together by using functional integration.
Each path is considered equally likely, and thus contributes the same amount. However, the phase of this contribution at any given point along the path is determined by the action along the path:





A

path


(
x
,
y
,
z
,
t
)
=

e

i
S
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
t
)




{\displaystyle A_{\text{path}}(x,y,z,t)=e^{iS(x,y,z,t)}}


All these contributions are then added together, and the magnitude of the final result is squared, to get the probability distribution for the position of a particle:




p
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
t
)
∝

all paths

,

,
z
,
t
)

2




{\displaystyle p(x,y,z,t)\propto \left\vert \int _{\text{all paths}}e^{iS(x,y,z,t)}\right\vert ^{2}}


As is always the case when calculating probability, the results must then be normalized by imposing:





∭

all space


p
(
x
,
y
,
z
,
t
)


d

V
=
1


{\displaystyle \iiint _{\text{all space}}p(x,y,z,t)\,\mathrm {d} V=1}


To summarize, the probability distribution of the outcome is the normalized square of the norm of the superposition, over all paths from the point of origin to the final point, of waves propagating proportionally to the action along each path. The differences in the cumulative action along the different paths (and thus the relative phases of the contributions) produces the interference pattern observed by the double-slit experiment. Feynman stressed that his formulation is merely a mathematical description, not an attempt to describe a real process that we can measure.
