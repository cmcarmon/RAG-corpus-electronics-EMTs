A counterpoise view B is used when easy access to the base of the antenna is necessary. It is also 
used when the earth is not a good conducting surface, such as ground that is sandy or solid rock. The 
counterpoise serves the same purpose as the ground screen but it is usually elevated above the earth. No 
specific dimensions are necessary in the construction of a counterpoise nor is the number of wires 
particularly critical. A practical counterpoise may be assembled from a large screen of chicken wire or 
some similar material. This screen may be placed on the ground, but better results are obtained if it is 
placed a few feet above the ground.
