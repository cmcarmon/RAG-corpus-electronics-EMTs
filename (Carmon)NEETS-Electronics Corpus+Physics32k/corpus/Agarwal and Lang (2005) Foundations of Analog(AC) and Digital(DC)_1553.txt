By introducing a buffer, the effective length of wire driven by either the inverter INV A
or the buffer is l/2. For large l, given the nonlinear relationship between wire length and
delay, the sum of the delays in driving the two l/2 wire segments is smaller than driving
a single wire segment of length l.
