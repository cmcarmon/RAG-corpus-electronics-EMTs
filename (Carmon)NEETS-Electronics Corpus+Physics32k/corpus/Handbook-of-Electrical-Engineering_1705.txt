In our example, each pixel is represented by one of four possible values. For ease of representation of the
data, it would be simpler to assign to each pixel the index value 0, 1, 2, 3, instead of 10, 20, 50, 110. In fact,
this is typically done by the quantization process. One needs a simple table to know that a pixel assigned the
value  2  corresponds  to  an  energy  of  50. Also,  the  number  of  possible  energy  levels  is  typically  some  integer
 needed to represent the
power of two to also aid in representation. This power is known as the number of 
energy of each pixel. In our example each pixel is represented by two bits.
