Another step in investigating the open-circuited rf line is to see how the current waves act. The
incident current wave is the solid line in figure 3-26, view C. The voltage is represented by the dotted
line. The current is in phase with the voltage while traveling toward the receiving end. At the end of the
line, the current is reflected in the opposite polarity; that is, it is shifted 180 degrees in phase, but its
amplitude remains the same. The reflected wave of current is shown by dashed lines in view C. The
heavy-line curve represents the sum of the two instantaneous currents and is the resultant wave. Notice
that current is zero at the end of the line. This is reasonable, since there can be no current flow through an
open circuit.
