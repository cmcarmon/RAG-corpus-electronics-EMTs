To determine the value of this constant power, use Eq. (3.14) as a model. The contribution of the kth source
to the total (constant) power is *S* cos(ak – bk). One can easily verify that ak – bk = a1 – b1 = –b1. The ﬁrst
equality follows from the relationships among the a’s from Eq. (3.15) and among the b’s from Eq. (3.16). The
choice of a1 = 0 leads to the last equality. Hence, the constant terms contributed to the power by each source
are the same. If P is the total average power, then:
