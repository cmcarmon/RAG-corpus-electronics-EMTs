tion, but there has been increasing research activity on gradual
shot boundary detection as well. Most of the existing tech-
niques reported in the literature detect shot boundary by
extracting some form of feature for each frame in the video
sequence, then evaluating a similarity measure on features
extracted from successive pairs of frames in the video se-
quence, and ﬁnally declaring the detection of a shot boundary
if the features difference conveyed by the similarity measure
exceeds a threshold. One such approach is presented in
(Naphade et al., 1998a) in which two difference metrics, histo-
gram distance metric (HDM) and spatial distance metric
(SDM), are computed for every frame pair. HDM is deﬁned
in terms of three-channel linearized histograms computed for
successive frame pair fi and fiþ1 as follows:
