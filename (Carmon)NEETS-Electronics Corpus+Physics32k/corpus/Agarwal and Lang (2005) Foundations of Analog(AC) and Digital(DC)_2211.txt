Based on your knowledge of Op Amp limitations, indicate the constraints that must
be placed on the component values R and C to achieve satisfactory operation, assum-
ing that the input is a sine wave with angular frequency Ï‰ and peak amplitude A.
Express your answer as a constraint on the RC product imposed by the voltage
limit, and a separate constraint imposed by the current limit.
