Technetium 99m can be used to tag red blood cells for blood pool measurements, human serum albumin
for blood pool and protein distribution, or monoclonal antibodies for potential detection of individual tumors
or  blood  cells.  Emission  computed  tomography  techniques  such  as  PET  and  SPECT  follow  the  recent  trend
toward imaging techniques that image physiologic processes as opposed to anatomic imaging of organ systems.
The relatively low cost of SPECT systems has led to a recent resurgence of interest in this modality.
