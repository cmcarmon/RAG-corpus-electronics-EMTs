(c)  It  is  clear  from  Fig. 83.4  that  many  of  the  photons  generated  on  either  side  of  the  junction  will  pass
through  sufﬁcient  bulk  semiconductor  to  be  reabsorbed.  In  fact  the  photon  energy  may  be  ideally  suited  to
reabsorption if it exceeds the semiconductor direct bandgap. It is obvious, then, why GaAs is opaque and GaP
transparent  to  photons  from  Ga(As:P)  junctions.  Clearly,  a  greater  efﬁciency  might  be  expected  from  the
transparent substrate with reﬂecting contact [Fig. 83.4(b)].
