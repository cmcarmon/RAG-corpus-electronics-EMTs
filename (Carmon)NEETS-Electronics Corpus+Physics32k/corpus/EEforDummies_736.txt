Operational amplifiers
The most popular type of linear (analog) IC is undoubtedly the operational 
amplifier, nicknamed the op amp, which is designed to add muscle to (that is, 
amplify) a weak signal. An op amp contains several transistors, resistors, and 
capacitors, and offers more robust performance than a single transistor. For 
example, an op amp can provide uniform amplification over a much wider 
range of frequencies (bandwidth) than can a single‚Äêtransistor amplifier.
