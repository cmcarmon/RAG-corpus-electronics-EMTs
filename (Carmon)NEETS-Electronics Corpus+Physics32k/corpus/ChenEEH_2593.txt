usually realized with TEM or quasi-TEM mode transmission
lines like strip line, microstrip line, coaxial line, and coplanar
waveguide because they have no cutoff frequency. The equiva-
lent LC circuit elements can be designed with short line
sections of high and low impedances (stepped impedance),
respectively. In some cases, LC lumped elements like spiral
inductors and MIM capacitors are used to realize a ﬁlter on
an MMIC chip or a high-density hybrid integrated circuit.
Although using LC lumped elements reduces the size of the
passive ﬁlter structure, the Q value, insertion loss, and slope
selectivity may deteriorate signiﬁcantly.
