Point



O

is the point on the dial plate directly under the two wires' intersection.
That point is the origin of the X,Y co-ordinate system referred to below.
The X-axis is the east-west line passing through the origin. The Y-axis is the north-south line passing through the origin. The positive Y direction is northward.
One can show that if the position of the sun is known and determined by the spherical coordinates
