Geopressured Source
In  deep  underground  holes  (8000  to  30,000  ft)  a  mixture  of  pressurized  water  and
. 
natural  gas,  like  methane,  may  sometimes  be  found.  These  geopressured  sources  promise  power  generation
through the combustion of methane and the direct recovery of heat from the water. The geopressured method
is currently in an experimental stage, with operating pilot plants.
