Another calculation of the equation of time can be done as follows. Angles are in degrees; the conventional order of operations applies.
W = 360°/365.24 days
W is the Earth's mean angular orbital velocity in degrees per day.
A = W × (D + 10)
D is the date, in days starting at zero on 1 January (i.e. the days part of the ordinal date minus 1). 10 is the approximate number of days from the December solstice to 1 January. A is the angle the earth would move on its orbit at its average speed from the December solstice to date D.
B = A + 360°/π × 0.0167 × sin [W(D − 2)]
B is the angle the Earth moves from the solstice to date D, including a first-order correction for the Earth's orbital eccentricity, 0.0167. The number 2 is the number of days from 1 January to the date of the Earth's perihelion. This expression for B can be simplified by combining constants to:
B = A + 1.914° × sin [W(D − 2)].

{\displaystyle C={\frac {A-\arctan {\frac {\tan B}{\cos 23.44^{\circ }}}}{180^{\circ }}}}

C is the difference between the angles moved at mean speed, and at the corrected speed projected onto the equatorial plane, and divided by 180 to get the difference in "half turns". The value 23.44° is the obliquity (tilt) of the Earth's axis. The subtraction gives the conventional sign to the equation of time. For any given value of x, arctan x (sometimes written as tan−1 x) has multiple values, differing from each other by integer numbers of half turns. The value generated by a calculator or computer may not be the appropriate one for this calculation. This may cause C to be wrong by an integer number of half turns. The excess half turns are removed in the next step of the calculation to give the equation of time:
EOT = 720 × (C − nint(C)) minutes
The expression nint(C) means the nearest integer to C. On a computer, it can be programmed, for example, as INT(C + 0.5). It is 0, 1, or 2 at different times of the year. Subtracting it leaves a small positive or negative fractional number of half turns, which is multiplied by 720, the number of minutes (12 hours) that the Earth takes to rotate one half turn relative to the Sun, to get the equation of time.
Compared with published values, this calculation has a root mean square error of only 3.7 s. The greatest error is 6.0 s. This is much more accurate than the approximation described above, but not as accurate as the elaborate calculation.
