quency response (determined by computing the discrete Fourier transform) is shown in Figure 5.23.
To apply, we can select the length of each section so that the frequency-domain ﬁltering approach
is maximally eﬃcient: Choose the section length Nx so that Nx + q is a power of two. To use
a length-64 FFT, each section must be 48 samples long. Filtering with the diﬀerence equation
would require 33 computations per output while the frequency domain requires a little over 16; this
frequency-domain implementation is over twice as fast! Figure 5.22 shows how frequency-domain
ﬁltering works.
