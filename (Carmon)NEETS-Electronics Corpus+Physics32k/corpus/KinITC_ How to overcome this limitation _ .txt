An important feature of ITC is that the instrument does not measure directly the total heat Q evolved during the reaction, but its rate of production (or absorption) during the reaction. Therefore, the primary signal is the heat power:
Ps(t) = dQ/dt (3)
and this is only by integrating Ps(t) that Q can be obtained. By definition of ΔH, one has therefore a direct link between Ps(t) and d[C]/dt, the rate of production of the compound C:
Ps(t)= Vcell ΔH d[C]/dt (4)
where Vcell is the volume of the cell where the reaction takes place. Therefore, knowing Ps(t) yields d[C] /dt, which opens the way for obtaining kinetic information.
