For	electric	current	to	flow	smoothly	within	a	system,	a	level	of	resistance	has	to
be	present.	And,	since	not	all	circuits	come	with	a	similar	design,	their	resistance
levels	vary.	To	calculate	a	particular	circuitâ€™s	resistance,	first,	you	need	determine
its	type,	and	its	provided	values,	as	well.
