At this point, the message signal is multiplied by a constant and a sinusoid at twice the carrier frequency.
Multiplication by the constant term returns the message signal to baseband (where we want it to be!) while
multiplication by the double-frequency term yields a very high frequency signal. The lowpass Ô¨Ålter removes
this high-frequency signal, leaving only the baseband signal. Thus, the received signal is
