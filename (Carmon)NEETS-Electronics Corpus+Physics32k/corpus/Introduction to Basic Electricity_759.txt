Another feature is the ability to autoplace the 
components on a PCB. When autoplace is used to 
place the components on a board layout, it confirms 
that the parts will actually fit on the board. To confirm 
that the component placement can be routed, auto-
route the traces. Autorouting can often get the board 
finished in a fraction of the time needed to manually 
route it with adequate results.
