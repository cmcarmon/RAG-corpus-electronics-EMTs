It could well be that in some problems the time-domain version is more eﬃcient (more easily satisﬁes the
real time requirement), while in others the frequency domain approach is faster. In the latter situations, it is
the FFT algorithm for computing the Fourier transforms that enables the superiority of frequency-domain
implementations. Because complexity considerations only express how algorithm running-time increases with
system parameter choices, we need to detail both implementations to determine which will be more suitable
for any given ﬁltering problem. Filtering with a diﬀerence equation is straightforward, and the number of
computations that must be made for each output value is 2 (p + q).
