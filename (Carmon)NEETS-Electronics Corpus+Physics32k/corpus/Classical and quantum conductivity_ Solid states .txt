The advent of quantum mechanics allowed a greater understanding of the physical properties of solids. Solids can be split into two groups: amorphous and crystalline. Amorphous solid structures occur when a liquid is cooled too rapidly for the crystalline structure to form, for example glass. In a crystalline structure, several different types of bonding are possible, including ionic, covalent, and metallic. These, along with the sizes of the atoms, determine the crystal's structure.
Ionic crystals can form in as many as fourteen different shapes. For example, in the face-centered cubic structure, the crystalâ€™s unit cell is a cube, with the smaller of the two ions occupying the center of each face. In the body-centered cubic structure, eight of the larger ions form a cubic shape, while one of the smaller ions occupies its center. A hexagonal close-packed crystal structure is obtained by stacking identical spheres, and fitting these stacks into the triangular depressions of adjacent stacks.
