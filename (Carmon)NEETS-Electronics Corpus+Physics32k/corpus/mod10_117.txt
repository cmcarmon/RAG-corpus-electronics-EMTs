At a given temperature and atmospheric pressure, all sound waves travel in air at the same speed.
Thus the velocity that sound will travel through air at 32ยบ F (0ยบ C) is 1,087 feet per second. But for
practical purposes, the speed of sound in air may be considered as 1,100 feet per second. Table 1-1 gives
a comparison of the velocity of sound in various mediums.
