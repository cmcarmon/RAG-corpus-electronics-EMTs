And there are other important benefits. In practice, the system expedites the storage and retrieval of 
information the Navy has about its ships. In turn, information that is more accessible means a more timely 
supply of parts, an improved aid to planners on when and how long to schedule ships' overhauls, and 
updated information for making decisions whether to place additional or remove unnecessary shipboard 
equipment. These decisions are now made by laboriously using stacks of printed files. SNAP can sort 
through these files electronically so Navy planners can make more effective and timely decisions.
