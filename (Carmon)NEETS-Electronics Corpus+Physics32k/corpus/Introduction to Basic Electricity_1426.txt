An electric current	(i) consists of the drift of  electrons 
from an area of negative charge to an area of positive 
charge. The unit of measurement for current flow is the 
ampere (A). An ampere represents the amount of current 
in a conductor when 1 coulomb of charge moves past a 
point in 1 second. The relationship  between amperes and 
coulombs per second can be  expressed as follows:
