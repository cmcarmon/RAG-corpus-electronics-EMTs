Moisture in the feed forms larger particles by coagulating small particles. This effect reduces sieve efficiency. However the centrifugal force and vibration and acts to prevent aperture blockage and agglomerated particle formation. Feed particles are classified as fine, near-sized and oversized particles; most near-sized and fines pass through the aperture rapidly. The ratio of fine and near-size particles to oversize should be maximized to obtain high screening rates.
Rate of feed is proportional to efficiency and capacity of screen; high feed rate reaches steady state and resultsn in better screening rates. However, an optimum bed thickness should be maintained for consistent high efficiency.
