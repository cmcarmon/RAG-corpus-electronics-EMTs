C. Producing structures and mechanisms on a micrometer
scale is possible with a collection of numerous and varied
techniques. Laser-induced etching and deposition of mater-
ials, electroetching and electroplating, ultrasonic and electron
discharge milling, ink-jetting, molding and embossing are all
available to the MEMS designer. Wafer-to-wafer bonding to
buildup MEMS devices, or to vacuum package them, is also an
important process.
