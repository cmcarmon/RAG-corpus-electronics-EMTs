Suppose the radius of the sphere is



R


{\displaystyle R}
and the length of the cylinder (or the tunnel) is



h


{\displaystyle h}
.
By the Pythagorean theorem, the radius of the cylinder is

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {R^{2}-\left({\frac {h}{2}}\right)^{2}}},\qquad \qquad (1)}

and the radius of the horizontal cross-section of the sphere at height y above the "equator" is







R

{\displaystyle {\sqrt {R^{2}-y^{2}}}.\qquad \qquad (2)}

The cross-section of the band with the plane at height y is the region inside the larger circle of radius given by (2) and outside the smaller circle of radius given by (1). The cross-section's area is therefore the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{}\quad \pi ({\text{larger radius}})^{2}-\pi ({\text{smaller radius}})^{2}\\&=\pi \left({\sqrt {R^{2}-y^{2}}}\right)^{2}-\pi \left({\sqrt {R^{2}-\left({\frac {h}{2}}\right)^{2}\,{}}}\,\right)^{2}=\pi \left(\left({\frac {h}{2}}\right)^{2}-y^{2}\right).\end{aligned}}}

The radius R does not appear in the last quantity. Therefore, the area of the horizontal cross-section at height y does not depend on R, as long as y ≤ h/2 ≤ R. The volume of the band is

{\displaystyle \int _{-h/2}^{h/2}({\text{area of cross-section at height }}y)\,dy,}

and that does not depend on R.
This is an application of Cavalieri's principle: volumes with equal-sized corresponding cross-sections are equal. Indeed, the area of the cross-section is the same as that of the corresponding cross-section of a sphere of radius h/2, which has volume
