The primary advantage of DS-CDMA is its ability to tolerate
a fair amount of interfering signals compared to FDMA and
TDMA, which typically cannot tolerate any such interference.
With DS-CMA, adjacent microcells share the same frequencies,
whereas with FDMA and TDMA, it is not feasible for adjacent
microcells to share the same frequencies because of interfer-
ence.
