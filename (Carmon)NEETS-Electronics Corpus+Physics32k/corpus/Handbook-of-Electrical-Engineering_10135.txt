Independent Joint Control of the Robot
The independent joint control method assumes that a single joint of a robot is moving while all the other joints
are  ﬁxed.  A  typical  joint  position  control  system  is  shown  in  Fig. 101.12,  where  the  actuator  used  is  a  dc
servomotor [Luh, 1983]. In general, any one or a combination of electric motors and hydraulic or pneumatic
pistons can be used to move the joint through the desired positions. These motors may be connected directly
to the joint or indirectly through gears, chains, cables, or lead screws. The desired joint positions that are inputs
to the position loops are obtained from the trajectory planner. The actual position of the joint is obtained by
using a position sensor, such as a potentiometer or an optical encoder. An ampliﬁer is used for increasing the
