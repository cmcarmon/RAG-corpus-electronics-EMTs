Recent advances in very large scale integration (VLSI) have contributed to the current digital signal processors.
These processors are just special-purpose fast microprocessors characterized by architectures and instructions
suitable for real-time digital signal processing (DSP) applications. The commercial DSP processor, a little more
than a decade old, has emerged because of the ever-increasing number of signal processing applications. DSP
processors are now being utilized in a number of applications from communications and controls to speech
and image processing. They have found their way into talking toys and music synthesizers. A number of texts
[such  as  Chassaing,  1992]  and  articles  [such  as  Ahmed  and  Kline,  1991]  have  been  written,  discussing  the
applications that use DSP processors and the recent advances in DSP systems.
