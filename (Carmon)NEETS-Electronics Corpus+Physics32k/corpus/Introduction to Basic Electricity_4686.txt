Figure 46-4 shows a typical memory layout. The 
memory registers retain the binary data. This memory, 
based on its ability to store (write) or retrieve (read) 
data, is usually referred to as random-access read or 
writes memory (RAM). Based on the ability of being 
able to read only data or instruction from the memory, 
it is referred to as read-only memory (ROM).
