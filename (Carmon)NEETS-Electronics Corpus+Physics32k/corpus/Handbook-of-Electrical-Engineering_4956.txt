There  are  many  different  types  of  pyroelectrics  and  the  selection  of  a  material  depends  strongly  upon  the
application. It is possible to formulate from the given equations a number of Ô¨Ågures of merit which describe
the contribution of the physical properties of a material to the performance of a device. For example, the current
responsivity is proportional to
