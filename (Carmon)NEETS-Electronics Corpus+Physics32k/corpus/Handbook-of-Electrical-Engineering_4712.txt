In signal processing applications of ultrasonics, the propagating medium is often a single crystal, and thus
a  larger  number  of  independent  stiffness  constants  is  required  to  describe  the  mechanical  properties  of  the
medium, e.g., three in a cubic crystal, Ô¨Åve in a hexagonal, and six in a trigonal. Note that while the number of
are nonzero but are related to each other
independent constants is relatively small, a large number of the 
by the symmetry characteristics of the crystal. The phase velocities of each of the three independent plane waves
as  a  function  of
in  an  anisotropic  medium  depend  on  the  direction  of  propagation.  Rather  than  plotting 
giving the reciprocal of 
(or 
 for
angle of propagation, it is more common to use a 
) as a function of the direction of k. Usually planar cuts of such slowness surfaces are plotted as shown
a given 
in Figs. 48.1(a) and (b).
