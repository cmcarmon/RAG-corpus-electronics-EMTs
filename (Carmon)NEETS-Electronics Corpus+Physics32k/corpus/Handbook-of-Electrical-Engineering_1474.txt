HMM-based  continuous  speech  recognition  involves  determining  an  optimal  word  sequence  using  the
Viterbi algorithm. This algorithm uses dynamic programming to ﬁnd the optimal state sequence through an
HMM network representing the recognizer vocabulary and grammar. The optimal state sequence Q* = (q1* …
qT*)  is  deﬁned  as  the  sequence  which  maximizes  P(Q *O,l),  or  equivalently  P(Q,O*l).  Let d
t(i)  be  the  joint
probability of the optimal state sequence and the observations up to time t, ending in state Si at time t. Then
