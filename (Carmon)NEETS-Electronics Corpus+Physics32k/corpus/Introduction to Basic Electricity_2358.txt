An rc	time	constant reflects the relationship among 
time, resistance, and capacitance. An RC  circuit is 
shown in Figure 20-7. The time it takes a capacitor to 
charge and discharge is directly proportional to the 
amount of the resistance and capacitance. The time 
constant reflects the time required for a capacitor to 
charge up to 63.2% of the applied voltage or to dis-
charge down to 36.8%. The time constant is expressed 
as follows:
