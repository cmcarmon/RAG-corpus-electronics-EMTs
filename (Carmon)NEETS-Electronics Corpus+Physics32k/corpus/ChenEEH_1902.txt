Some of the inadequacies of the logic stuck-at-fault model
are overcome by the transistor stuck-at-fault model that as-
sumes a faultâ€™s behavior is akin to one or more transistors
always conducting (stuck-at-on) or always in a nonconducting
state (stuck-at-off) irrespective of gate inputs. For example,
the above wire-break fault in the NOR gate can be modeled as
the corresponding nMOS transistor stuck-at-off. Even this
model, however, cannot simulate a bridging fault. A clear
disadvantage of the transistor stuck-at-fault model vis-a-vis
the logic stuck-at-fault model is the additional complexity in
terms of the number of components that must be represented,
manipulated, and simulated (Johnson, 1989).
