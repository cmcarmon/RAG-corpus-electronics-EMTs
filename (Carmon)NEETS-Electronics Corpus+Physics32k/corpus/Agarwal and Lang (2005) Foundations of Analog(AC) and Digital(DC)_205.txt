In a similar way we can devise a model for a battery out of our ideal
elements. When a flashlight bulb is connected to a new nominally 6-V battery,
the voltage at the terminals of the battery (usually called the terminal voltage)
drops from 6.2 V to perhaps 6.1 V. This drop results from the internal resistance
of the battery. To represent this effect, we model the battery as an ideal voltage
source in series with some small resistor R as shown in Figure 1.37a. The drop in
