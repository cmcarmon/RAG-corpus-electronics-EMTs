Amorphous Magnetic Materials
Before 1960, all the known ferro- and ferrimagnetic materials were crystalline. Because the occurrence of these
magnetic states is known to depend on short-range interaction between atoms, there is no reason why amor-
phous  materials  (which  have  only  short-range  order)  should  not  have  useful  magnetic  properties.  This  was
found to be true in 1960, when thin, amorphous ribbons of Au81Si19 were made by rapidly cooling the molten
alloy through the melting point and the lower glass transition temperature. Because there is always at least one
crystalline  phase  more  stable  than  the  amorphous  state,  the  problem  is  to  invent  a  production  method  that
yields the amorphous phase rather than the crystalline one.
