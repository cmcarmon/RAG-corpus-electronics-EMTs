There are very many good references on Boolean algebra and we may quote only a selected few of them.
Sufﬁce it to mention the texts by Hill and Peterson [1974], Kohavi [1978], and Hohn [1966]. These books give
a  sufﬁciently  rigorous  formulation  of  the  subject,  tailored  to  the  analysis  and  the  design  of  combinational
networks. In addition, like most of the earlier books, Hohn’s and Kohavi’s texts also contain a discussion of
the  Boolean  techniques  used  in  connection  with  relay  circuits.  (Some  of  the  more  recent  works  completely
omit this topic, which has been but totally overshadowed by the impressive development of electronic networks.)
The reader interested in studying the relation of switching algebra to Boolean algebras in general is referred to
Preparata and Yeh [1973] for an elementary introduction.
