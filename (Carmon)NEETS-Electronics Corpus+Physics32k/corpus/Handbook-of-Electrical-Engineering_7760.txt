The Ô¨Årst commercial computer with a magnetic tape system was introduced in 1951. The UNIVAC I had a
magnetic tape system of 1.44M bits on 150 feet of tape and was capable of storing 128 characters per inch. The
tape could be read at a rate of 100 ips. Optical memories are now available as very fast storage devices and will
replace magnetic storage in the next few years. At present these devices are expensive although it is envisaged
that optical disks with large silicon caches will be the storage arrangement of the future where computer systems
utilizing CAD software and image processing can take advantage of the large storage capacities with fast access
times. In the future, semiconductor memories are likely to continue their advancing trend.
