version of the desired temperature and makes a decision whether or not to turn on the heater or the fan or to
do nothing. The program being executed runs in a continuous loop, repeating the operations discussed above.
This simple on-off control strategy is often not the best when extremely precise control of the process variables
is  required.  A  more  precise  control  may  be  obtained  if  the  controlling  variable  levels  can  be  adjusted  to  be
somewhat larger if the deviation of the process variable from the desired value is larger.
