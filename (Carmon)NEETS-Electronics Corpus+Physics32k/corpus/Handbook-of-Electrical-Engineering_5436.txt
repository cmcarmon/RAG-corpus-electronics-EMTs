The majority of present insulators are made of glazed porcelain. Porcelain is a ceramic product obtained by
the high-temperature vitriﬁcation of clay, ﬁnely ground feldspar, and silica. Porcelain insulators for transmission
may be disks, posts, or long-rod types. Glass insulators have been used on a signiﬁcant proportion of trans-
mission  lines.  These  are  made  from  toughened  glass  and  are  usually  clear  and  colorless  or  light  green.  For
transmission  voltages  they  are  available  only  as  disk  types.  Synthetic  insulators  are  usually  manufactured  as
long-rod or post types. Use of synthetic insulators on transmission lines is relatively recent, and a few questions
