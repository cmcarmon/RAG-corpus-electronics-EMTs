e x e r c i s e 6.4 Consider, again, the inverter circuit shown in Figure 6.60. The
MOSFET has a threshold voltage VT = 2 V. Assume that VS = 5 V and RL = 10k.
For this exercise, model the MOSFET using its switch-resistor model. Assume that the
on-state resistance of the MOSFET is RON = 8 k.
a) Does the inverter satisfy the static discipline, which has voltage thresholds given by
