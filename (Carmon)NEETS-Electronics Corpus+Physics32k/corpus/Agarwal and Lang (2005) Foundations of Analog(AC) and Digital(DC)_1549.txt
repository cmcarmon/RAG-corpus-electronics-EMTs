namely vINB, to fall from VS to VL following the 0 to 1 transition at the input of INV A.
Express your answer in terms of VS, VL, RON, CGS, the wire length l, and the wire
model parameters. By what factor does the delay increase for a 2Ã— increase in the wire
length l?

Figure 10.99 illustrates an inverter INV A driving n other invert-
ers INV1 through INVn. As in Problem 10.1, each of the inverters is constructed
using a MOSFET and a resistor RL, and the inverters satisfy the static discipline with
voltage thresholds VIL = VOL = VL and VIH = VOH = VH. Model the MOSFETs
using the SRC model with MOSFET on resistance RON and gate capacitance CGS as in
Problem 10.1 (see Figure 10.93.)
