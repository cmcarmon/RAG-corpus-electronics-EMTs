To complete the solution to Equation 12.40 we must again determine A1
and A2. To do so, we need specific information about v1, which we will again
be provided by specifying v1 and dv1/dt at an initial time, again chosen to be
t = 0. As mentioned earlier, it is actually more common to know iL and vC at
that initial time, and so we must use this information to first determine v1 and
dv1/dt at the initial time, and then A1 and A2. Since v1 and vC represent the
same voltage,
