The major components in a typical PULSE RADAR SYSTEM are shown in the illustration. The
SYNCHRONIZER supplies the timing signals to coordinate the operation of the entire system. The
TRANSMITTER generates electromagnetic energy in short, powerful pulses. The DUPLEXER allows
the same antenna to be used to both transmit and receive. The RECEIVER detects and amplifies the
return signals. The INDICATOR produces a visual indication of the range and bearing of the echo.
