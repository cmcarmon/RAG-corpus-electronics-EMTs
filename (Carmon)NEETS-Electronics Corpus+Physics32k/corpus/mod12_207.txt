each time the grid is driven positive. These rf pulses are referred to as current pulses and are shown in 
view (C). The plate tank output circuit (T3) is shocked into oscillation by these current pulses and the rf 
output waveform shown in view (E) is developed. The rf plate voltage waveform is shown in view (D).
