Materials of Magneto-Optical Data Storage
Amorphous rare earth transition metal alloys are presently the media of choice for erasable optical data storage
applications.  The  general  formula  for  the  composition  of  the  alloy  may  be  written  (TbyGd1–y)x (FezCo1-z)1–x
where terbium and gadolinium are the rare earth (RE) elements, while iron and cobalt are the transition metals
