. The characteristic impedance quantity is borrowed from
transmission line theory and is also used for a waveguide
to deﬁne the ratio between the transverse electric ﬁeld
and the corresponding transverse magnetic ﬁeld. It is
usually represented by the letter Z and is expressed in
ohms. In case a structure supports more than one mode
(for example TE and TM), two types of impedances
corresponding to each mode (Z TE and Z TM ) need to be
identiﬁed.
