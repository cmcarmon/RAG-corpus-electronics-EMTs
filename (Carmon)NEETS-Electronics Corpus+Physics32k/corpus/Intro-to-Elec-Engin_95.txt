CIRCUIT CONCEPTS
where k1 = ψ21/ψ11 and k2 = ψ12/ψ22. When k approaches unity, the two inductors are said
to be tightly coupled; and when k is much less than unity, they are said to be loosely coupled.
While the coefﬁcient of coupling can never exceed unity, it may be as high as 0.998 for iron-core
transformers; it may be smaller than 0.5 for air-core transformers.
