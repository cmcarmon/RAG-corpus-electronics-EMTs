Exponential laws are classical approach to study dynamics of population densities, but there are many systems where dynamics undergo faster or slower-than-exponential laws. In such case the anomalous changes in dynamics may be best described by Mittag-Leffler functions.
Anomalous diffusion is one more dynamic system where fractional-order systems play significant role to describe the anomalous flow in the diffusion process.
Viscoelasticity is the property of material in which the material exhibits its nature between purely elastic and pure fluid. In case of real materials the relationship between stress and strain given by Hooke's law and Newton's law both have obvious disadvances. So G. W. Scott Blair introduced a new relationship between stress and strain given by

In chaos theory, it has been observed that chaos occurs in dynamical systems of order 3 or more. With the introduction of fractional-order systems, some researchers study chaos in the system of total order less than 3.
