Another way to ﬁgure the same value of resistance would be to determine voltage drop
across the movement at full-scale deﬂection (E=IR), then subtract that voltage drop from the
total to arrive at the voltage across the multiplier resistor. Finally, Ohm’s Law could be used
again to determine resistance (R=E/I) for the multiplier:
