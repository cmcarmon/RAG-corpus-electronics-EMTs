in  a  VDR  is  negligible,  however,  when  the 
resistance falls, the current will become appreciable 
and  a  significant  amount  of  energy  will  be 
absorbed. VDRs are used as a means of ‘clamping’ 
the  voltage  in  a  circuit  to  a  pre-determined  level. 
When connected across the supply rails to a circuit 
(either a.c or d.c.) they are able to offer a measure 
of protection against voltage surges.
