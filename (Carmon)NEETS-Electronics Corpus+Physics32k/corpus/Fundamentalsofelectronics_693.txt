Problem 5.5: Sampling Signals
If a signal is bandlimited to W Hz, we can sample it at any rate 1
> 2W and recover the waveform exactly.

This statement of the Sampling Theorem can be taken to mean that all information about the original
signal can be extracted from the samples. While true in principle, you do have to be careful how you do
so. In addition to the rms value of a signal, an important aspect of a signal is its peak value, which equals
max{|s (t)|}.
(a) Let s (t) be a sinusoid having frequency W Hz. If we sample it at precisely the Nyquist rate, how
accurately do the samples convey the sinusoid’s amplitude? In other words, ﬁnd the worst case example.
