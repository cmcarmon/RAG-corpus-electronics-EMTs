Note that, for ﬁxed values of Ro and Ri, GP is maximized when RL is chosen equal to Ro, and this
corresponds to maximum power transfer to the load. One should also note that the added power
emerging from the output comes from the power source that powers the ampliﬁer, even though
the power-supply connections are usually not shown on the circuit diagram, and that the existence
of power gain does not violate the law of energy conservation.
