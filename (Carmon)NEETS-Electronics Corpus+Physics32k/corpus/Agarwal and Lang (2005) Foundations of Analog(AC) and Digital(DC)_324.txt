A current divider is a circuit with two nodes joining two or more parallel resistors
and a current source. Two current dividers are shown in Figures 2.37 and 2.38,
the first with two resistors and the second with N resistors. In these circuits,
the resistors share, or divide, the current from the source in proportion to their
conductances. It turns out that the equations for voltage dividers comprising
voltages and resistances, and those for current dividers comprising currents
and conductances, are very similar. Therefore, to highlight the duality between
these two types of circuits, we will attempt to mirror the steps from our voltage
divider discussion.
