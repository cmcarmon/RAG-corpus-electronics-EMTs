Doping
In a pure semiconductor, the electron concentration in the
conduction band and the hole concentration in the valence
band are usually very small compared to the number of avail-
able energy states. These concentrations can be changed by
many orders of magnitude by doping, which means adding to
a semiconductor impurity atoms that can ‘‘donate’’ electrons
to the conduction band (such impurities are called donors) or
‘‘accept’’ electrons from the valence band creating holes (such
impurities are called acceptors). Both donors and acceptors are
referred to as dopants. A donor atom has more electrons
available for bonding with neighboring atoms than is required
for an atom in the host semiconductor. For example, a silicon
atom has four electrons available for bonding and forms four
bonds with the four nearest silicon atoms. A phosphorus atom
has ﬁve electrons available for bonding. Hence, when a phos-
phorus atom replaces a silicon atom in a silicon crystal, it can
bond with the four nearest neighbors and ‘‘donate’’ one extra
electron to the conduction band.
