Next we should determine the base current. This is 
a little  more  difficult.  The  base  current  is  derived 
from  the  potential  divider  formed  by  R1 and  R2. 
The potential at the junction of R1 and R2 is 2.6 V 
hence  we  can  determine  the  currents  through  R1
and R2, the difference between these currents  will 
be equal to the base current.  
  The current in R2 will be given by:
