If one heats a pot of soup on the stove the pot will develop a temperature gradient, (warmest on the bottom and cooler at the surface). Mild agitation will increase the rate of heating by dissipating the heat through the entire pot. See: Law of cooling (which also applies to heating). Even more significant, agitation disturbs the soup directly in contact with the hotter pot surface. Highly turbulent flow at the warming surface is important to good heat transfer. This is the same effect as the "wind chill" factor where moving air and turbulent action on surfaces (like those on people) resulting in significantly enhanced heat transfer. In unusual circumstances, overly-severe agitation may decrease the rate of heating which defeats the purpose.
