Output Circuitry
The output circuitry is responsible for delivering the pacing pulses through the electrodes to the cardiac tissue
in order to artiﬁcially control (capture) the heart. Because the amount of energy needed for capture can vary
over the lifetime of a patient (e.g., due to changing electrode impedance or position) and between different
patients, it is necessary to be able to deliver a controlled amount of energy per pacing pulse. Many pacemakers
use an output voltage much higher than the pacing threshold to ensure capture for every pulse; however, this
may unnecessarily waste energy. The minimum reliable pulse voltage necessary for capture is desired in order
to minimize the current drain on the battery. Autocapture algorithms are capable of monitoring every pulse
for capture and adjusting the output voltage to the minimum necessary value on demand [Jones et al., 1999].
This feature will become more prevalent in future pacemakers. Timing circuitry and output ampliﬁers are used
to control the frequency, pulse width, and amplitude of the stimuli. Capacitors controlled by electronic switches
physically deliver the energy. The capacitors are charged by the battery up to the desired voltage in between
pacing pulses and then discharged into the heart by the switches at the proper timing. Voltage multipliers can
be used to double or triple the battery voltage if necessary.
