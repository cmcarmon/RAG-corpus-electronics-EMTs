Just as Cm1 and Cm2 superimpose to yield the original Cm in the simpliﬁed high frequency model of a BJT, the
effective base resistances, Rb1 and Rb2, sum to yield the original base resistance, Rb. The resistance, Rb1, is the
contact resistance associated with the base lead and the inactive BJT base region. It is inversely proportional to
the surface area of the base contact. On the other hand, Rb2, which is referred to as the active base resistance,
is nominally an inverse function of emitter ﬁnger length. Because of submicron base widths and the relatively
light average doping concentrations of active base regions, Rb2 is signiﬁcantly larger than Rb1.
