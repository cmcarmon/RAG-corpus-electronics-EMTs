11.2.2 E N E R G Y D I S S I P A T E D D U R I N G I N T E R V A L T2
Now, let us consider the second interval T2 in which the switch is off. During
T2, the capacitor discharges through the resistor R2. For simplicity,
let us
assume the special case considered in the previous section in which T1 (cid:3) RTHC.
In this case, at the start of the second interval, the capacitor will have an initial
voltage of VTH across it.
