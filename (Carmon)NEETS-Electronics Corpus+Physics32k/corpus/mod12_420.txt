Amplitude modulation refers to any method of modulating an electromagnetic carrier frequency by
varying its amplitude in accordance with the message intelligence that is to be transmitted. This is
accomplished by heterodyning the intelligence frequency with the carrier frequency. The vector
summation of the carrier, sum, and difference frequencies causes the modulation envelope to vary in
amplitude at the intelligence frequency, as discussed in chapter 1. In this section we will discuss several
circuits that can be used to recover this intelligence from the variations in the modulation envelope.
