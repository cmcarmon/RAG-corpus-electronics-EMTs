Another simpliﬁcation that is often used when seeking to
calculate the distribution of circuit’s voltages and currents, is a
piecewise-linear approximation of the nonlinear element’s
characteristics. The piecewise-linear approximation represents
a nonlinear function with a set of nonoverlapping linear
segments closely resembling the nonlinear characteristic. For
example,
this approach is used when calculating circuit
voltages and currents for rather simple nonlinear electronic
circuits or when applying certain computer-aided software
design tools.
