5. Increasing the relative stability. Increasing the open-loop gain tends to reduce phase and gain margins,
which  generally  increases  the  overshoot  in  the  system  response.  Hence,  a  trade-off  exists  between  the
beneﬁcial effects of increasing the open-loop gain and the resulting detrimental effects of reducing the
stability margins.
