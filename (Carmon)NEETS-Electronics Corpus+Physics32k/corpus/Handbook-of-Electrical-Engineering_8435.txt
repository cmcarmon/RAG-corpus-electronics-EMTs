2’s Complement Representation. The radix complement for binary is the 2’s complement representation. In
2’s complement the MSB is the sign bit, 1 indicating a negative number or 0 if positive. The decimal range of
representation for n-integer bits in 2’s complement is from  –(2n–1) through +(2n–1). From Eq. (86.11), the 2’s
complement is formed by
