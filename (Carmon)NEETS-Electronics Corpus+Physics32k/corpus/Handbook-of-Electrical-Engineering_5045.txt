Dielectric strength: Represents the value of the externally applied electric ﬁeld at which breakdown or failure
of the dielectric takes place. Unless a completely uniform ﬁeld gradient can be assured across the dielectric
specimen,  the  resulting  breakdown  value  will  be  a  function  of  the  specimen  thickness  and  the  test
electrode geometry; this value will be substantially below that of the intrinsic breakdown strength.
