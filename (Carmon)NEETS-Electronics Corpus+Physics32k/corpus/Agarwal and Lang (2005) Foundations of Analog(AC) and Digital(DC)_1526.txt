(cid:1) When the input signal is a short pulse (short compared to the time constant
of the circuit), the response is proportional to the area of the applied pulse
rather than to its height or shape.
It is often convenient to break down a problem involving energy-storage ele-
ments into two parts. First, calculate the zero-input response, the response
