This chapter exposes the relationship between elec-
tricity and magnetism and explains how 19th‐century 
scientists purposely exploited that relationship to create 
inductors and transformers. You get a look at what happens 
when you try to change the direction of current through an induc-
tor too quickly. Then you explore how inductors are used in circuits and why 
crystals ring at just one frequency. Finally, you get a handle on how transform-
ers transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another — without any direct 
contact between the circuits.
