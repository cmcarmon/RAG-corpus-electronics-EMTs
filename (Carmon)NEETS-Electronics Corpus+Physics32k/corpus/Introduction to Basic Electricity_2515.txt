Using a faceplate that has been marked in cen-
timeters along both a vertical and a horizontal axis 
(Figure 22-9), the oscilloscope can be calibrated with 
a known voltage before testing an unknown signal. 
Then, when the unknown signal is applied, its ampli-
tude can be calculated. Rather than mark the actual 
faceplate of the CRT, oscilloscopes are provided with 
separate faceplates called graticules that are mounted 
in front of the CRT.
