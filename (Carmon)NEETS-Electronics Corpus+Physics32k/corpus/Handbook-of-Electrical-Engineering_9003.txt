There are basically six major steps employed in the EP printing process (see Fig. 89.21): (1) uniform charging
of the photoconductor (PC) electrostatically; (2) exposing the PC to the image light pattern, which results in
selective discharge of the area charge created in Step 1, creating an electrostatic image; (3) developing the PC
by  bringing  electrostatically  charged  toner  particles  (black  or  colored)  to  the  surface  of  the  PC  where  they
selectively adhere to appropriately charged regions; (4) electrostatically transferring the toned image from the
PC to the Ô¨Ånal medium (usually paper); (5) thermal fusing of the toner to the paper; and (6) cleaning residual
toner from the surface of the PC to allow reinitiation of the six step cycle.
