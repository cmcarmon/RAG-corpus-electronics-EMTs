From the above equation and Figure 4.4, we note that if the
sampling intervals do not satisfy the Nyquist conditions
V1  2p=Tx and V2  2p=Ty then the analog signal cannot
be reconstructed from its samples. This is due to the overlap of
the replicated frequency spectra, which, likewise in the one-
dimensional case, is known as aliasing. Aliasing is illustrated in
Figure 4.5.
