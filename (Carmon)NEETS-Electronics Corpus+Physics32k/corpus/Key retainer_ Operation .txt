One key (High Level/Special) is retained in a core (at 1/4 turn) until another "release" key is inserted in the other core and rotated 90Â° (1/4 turn). Then the "retained" key can be removed for use while the "release" key is held (trapped) for visual accountability purposes. This cycle is repeated in reverse when the normally "retained" key is returned and the "release" key is removed "retrieved" by the authorized user.
