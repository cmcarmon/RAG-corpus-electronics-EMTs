The lower sideband [view (D)] has a frequency of 7 hertz and cannot complete an entire cycle in 1/8 
of a second. During the time interval required for the carrier wave to progress through 360 degrees, the 
lower sideband frequency of 7 hertz can complete only 315 degrees, 45 degrees short of a full cycle.
