Figure 7.33 illustrates how the amplifier transfer curve (that is, its vIN versus
vO curve) can be determined. For some specific value of the input voltage, say
vIN = vGSi, we can determine the output voltage vO = vDSi by finding the
intersection between the load line for RL and the output current iDSi for the
given input voltage vGSi. We can then plot these values to obtain the transfer
function shown in Figure 7.21.
