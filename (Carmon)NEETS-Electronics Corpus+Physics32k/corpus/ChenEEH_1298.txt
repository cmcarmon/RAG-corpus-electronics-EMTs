Industry Standard Architecture
The industry standard architecture (ISA) bus was originally
designed for the IBM PC XT with an 8088 (at 4.77 MHz)

(1 MB of memory addressing). The PC/AT 80286-based
systems maintain the 8-bit PC compatibility and add a 16-bit
connector using 16 data lines and 24 address lines. Some
features of ISA busses are the following:
