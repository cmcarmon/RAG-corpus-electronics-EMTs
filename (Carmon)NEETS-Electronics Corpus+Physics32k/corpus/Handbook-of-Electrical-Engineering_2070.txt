The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing is
keeping  up-to-date  on  algorithms  in  audio.  Every  two  to  three  years,  a  workshop  on  applications  of  signal
processing to audio and electroacoustics covers the latest advances in areas introduced in this article. IEEE can
be  reached  at  445  Hoes  Lane,  Piscataway,  NJ  08855-1331,  ph.  (908)  981-0060.  The  Journal  of  the  Audio
Engineering Society (AES) is another useful source of information on audio. The AES can be reached at 60 East
42nd  St.,  Suite  2520,  New York,  NY  10165-0075,  ph.  (212)  661-8528. The  Journal  of  the Acoustical  Society  of
America  (ASA)  contains  information  on  physical,  psychological,  and  physiological  acoustics,  as  well  as  on
acoustic  signal  processing,  among  other  things.  ASA’s “Auditory  Demonstrations”  CD  contains  examples  of
signals demonstrating hearing-related phenomena ranging from “critical bands” over “pitch” to “binaural beats.”
ASA can be reached at 500 Sunnyside Blvd., Woodbury, NY 11797-2999, ph. (516) 576-2360.
