A line-of-sight (los) microwave system consists of one or more point-to-point hops as shown in 
figure 5-7. Each hop is designed so that it can be integrated into a worldwide communications network. 
Los systems have many characteristics. In these systems, propagation is only affected by changes in the 
troposphere. The distance between microwave system hop points ranges from 50 to 150 kilometers (31 to 
95 statute miles). These systems are capable of handling up to 600 4-kilohertz voice channels and can also 
transmit television. These signals can usually be transmitted with less than 10 watts of power. Both the 
transmit and receive antennas are horn-driven paraboloids that provide high gain and narrow beam 
widths. In some applications, as shown in figure 5-8, plane reflectors are used with the paraboloids. These 
systems are very reliable. They are designed to operate over 99 percent of the time. These systems are 
well adapted to multichannel communications and closed circuit television.
