It  can  be  shown  that  p*  is  well-deÔ¨Åned  and  that  there  is  always  a  model  with  maximum  entropy  in  any
constrained set C. For simple cases, the above equation can be solved mathematically, but for a more general
case, the use of Lagrange multipliers from constrained optimization theory is employed. This approach leads
to the following statement. The maximum entropy model subject to a set of constraints, has the parametric
form given by Eq. 15.65,
