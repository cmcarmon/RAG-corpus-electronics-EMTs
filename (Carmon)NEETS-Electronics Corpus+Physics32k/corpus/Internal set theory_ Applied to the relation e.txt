More precisely we take for R(g, f): g is a finite set containing element f. Since "For every standard, finite set F, there is a finite set g such that f ∈ g for all f in F" – say by choosing g = F itself – we may use Idealisation to derive "There is a finite set G such that f ∈ G for all standard f." For any set S, the intersection of S with the set G is a finite subset of S that contains every standard element of S. G is necessarily nonstandard.
