Today the Internet is a conglomeration of a huge number of interconnected LANs around the world. These are
a  series  of  linked  IPs,  functioning  on  their  own,  but  able  to  instantly  connect  with  any  other  LAN  likewise
connected  to  the  Internet.  It  also  covers  the  thousands  of  personal  computers  at  home  or  in  the  ofÔ¨Åce.  The
Internet can also connect to a wide range of other networks, including privately operated ones like America
On Line, Prodigy, and Compuserve, plus hundreds of other special networks now in use throughout the world.
All you need is their IP, email account, or Web site address. As more and more users access the Internet problems
of speed, capacity, and reliability begin to crop up. These will be discussed later in the chapter.
