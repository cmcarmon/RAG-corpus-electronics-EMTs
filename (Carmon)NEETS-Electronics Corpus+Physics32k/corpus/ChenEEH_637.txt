As implied by the deﬁnition of neq in equation 1.16, how-
ever, the linear system that provides an equivalent range to that
of a (k, l, b)-LNS, requires neq bits. If the reduced precision of a
(k, l, b)-LNS, compared to an neq-bit ﬁxed-point system, is
0
acceptable for a particular application, S
ave is used to describe
the relative efﬁciency of LNS, instead of equation 1.36, where:
