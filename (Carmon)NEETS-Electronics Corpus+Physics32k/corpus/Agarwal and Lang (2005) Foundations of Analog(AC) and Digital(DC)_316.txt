In electronic circuits one often finds resistors connected in series, as shown in
Figures 2.31 and 2.32. For example, in our lightbulb example of Chapter 1,
suppose the wire had a nonzero resistance, then the current through the wire
including those of
would be related to the value of several resistances
in series. Our lumped circuit abstraction and the
the wires and the bulb
resulting Kirchhoffâ€™s laws allow us to calculate the equivalent resistance of such
combinations using simple algebra.
