Except for trailing-wire antennas used in aircraft installations (which may be lengthened or 
shortened), physically lengthening the antenna is not very practical. But you can achieve the same result 
by changing the electrical length of the antenna. To change the electrical length, you can insert either an 
inductor or a capacitor in series with the antenna. This is shown in figure 4-13, views A and B. Changing 
the electrical length by this method is known as LUMPED-IMPEDANCE TUNING, or LOADING. The 
electrical length of any antenna wire can be increased or decreased by loading. If the antenna is too short 
for the wavelength being used, it is resonant at a higher frequency than that at which it is being excited. 
Therefore, it offers a capacitive reactance at the excitation frequency. This capacitive reactance can be 
compensated for by introducing a lumped-inductive reactance, as shown in view A. Similarly, if the 
antenna is too long for the transmitting frequency, it offers an inductive reactance. Inductive reactance 
can be compensated for by introducing a lumped-capacitive reactance, as shown in view B. An antenna 
without loading is represented in view C.
