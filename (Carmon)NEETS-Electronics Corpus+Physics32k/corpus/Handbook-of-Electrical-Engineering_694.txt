Partial Fraction Expansion Method
As just indicated, the partial fraction expansion method provides a convenient technique for reacquiring the
signal that generates a given rational Laplace transform. Recall that a transform function is said to be rational
if it is expressible as a ratio of polynomial in s, that is,
