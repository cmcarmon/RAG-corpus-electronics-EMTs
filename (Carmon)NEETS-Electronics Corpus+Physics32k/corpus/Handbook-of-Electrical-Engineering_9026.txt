to the ribbon substrate. The ribbon is then peeled away from the paper, leaving the desired image on the paper.
Considerable  energy  must  be  applied  to  melt  the  ink  layer  (e.g.,  2–4  J/cm2)  which  does  restrict  speed. Also,
comparably smooth paper (£50–100 ml/min Shefﬁeld roughness) is required for quality printing with minimal
gaps or voids. Print resolution of better than 8 pixels/mm can be achieved with smooth paper.
