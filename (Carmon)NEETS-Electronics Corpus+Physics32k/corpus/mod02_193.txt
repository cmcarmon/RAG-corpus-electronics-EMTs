Because the impressed voltage and the values of R and C or R and L in a circuit are usually known, a
UNIVERSAL TIME CONSTANT CHART (fig. 3-12) can be used to find the time constant of the circuit.
Curve A is a plot of both capacitor voltage during charge and inductor current during growth. Curve B is a
plot of both capacitor voltage during discharge and inductor current during decay.
