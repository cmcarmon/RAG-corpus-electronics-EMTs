Satellites function as line-of-sight microwave relays in orbits high above the earth which can see large areas
of the earthâ€™s surface. Because of this unique feature, satellites are particularly well suited to communications
over wide coverage areas such as for broadcasting, mobile communications, and point-to-multipoint commu-
nications. Satellite systems can also provide cost-effective access for many locations where the high investment
cost of terrestrial facilities might not be warranted.
