1. Unbalance. A gyro often becomes dynamically unbalanced when operated at a speed or 
temperature other than that for which it was designed. The static balance of the gyro is upset 
when its center of gravity is not at the intersection of the three major axes. Some unbalance of 
both types will exist in any gyro since manufacturing processes cannot produce a perfectly 
balanced gyro.
