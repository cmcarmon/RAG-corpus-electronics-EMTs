With use, tape transport parts become magnetized. It's hard to say exactly what will happen if the 
magnetic tape passes a magnetized part of the tape transport before the tape is recorded on. The effects 
can range from just a little more noise on the tape to a complete tape saturation. Either way, magnetized 
tape transport parts can ruin magnetic recordings.
