In physics, complementarity is both a theoretical and an experimental result of quantum mechanics, also referred to as principle of complementarity. It holds that objects have complementary properties which cannot all be observed or measured simultaneously.
The complementarity principle was formulated by Niels Bohr, a leading founder of quantum mechanics. Examples of complementary properties that Bohr considered:
Position and momentum
Energy and duration
Spin on different axes
Wave and particle
Value of a field and its change (at a certain position)
Entanglement and coherence
