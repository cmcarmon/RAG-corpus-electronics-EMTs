In electric circuits, the excitations are provided by the voltage and current sources, whereas
the responses are in terms of element voltages and currents. All circuits containing only ideal
resistances, capacitances, inductances, and sources are linear circuits (described by linear dif-
ferential equations). For a linear network consisting of several independent sources, according
to the principle of superposition, the net response in any element is the algebraic sum of the
individual responses produced by each of the independent sources acting only by itself. While each
independent source acting on the network is considered separately by itself, the other independent
sources are suppressed; that is to say, voltage sources are replaced by short circuits and current
sources are replaced by open circuits, thereby reducing the source strength to zero. The effect of
any dependent sources, however, must be included in evaluating the response due to each of the
independent sources, as illustrated in the following example.
