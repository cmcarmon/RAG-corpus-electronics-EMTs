When RL is less than Z0, the termination appears as a short circuit. The standing waves are shown in
figure 3-34, view H. Notice that the line terminates in a current LOOP (peak) and a voltage NODE
(minimum). The values of the maximum and minimum voltage and current approach those for a shorted
line as the value of RL approaches zero.
