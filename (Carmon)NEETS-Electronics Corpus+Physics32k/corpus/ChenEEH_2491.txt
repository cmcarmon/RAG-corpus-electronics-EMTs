An arbitrarily shaped multiport (four ports in the following
example) microwave passive component is depicted in Figure
7.1, in which the inbound (or incident) power is always equal
to the outbound (or reﬂected) power plus the possible dissi-
pated power in the circuit. In most practical applications, a
microwave circuit is modeled by scattering or S-parameters
that are deﬁned through the incident and reﬂected measurable
voltage (or alternatively current) waves V i and V r (or I i and
I r ) at particular planes of reference for a given mode of
propagation, such as a transverse electric mode (TEM). Circuit
properties considering multiple modes of operation (propa-
gating or evanescent) are described with the generalized
S-parameter matrix. The difference is that for only one mode
of propagation, the voltages and S-parameters per port are
single-valued, whereas for multimode propagation or evanes-
cent modes, the voltages and S-parameters become vectors and
submatrices, respectively. For single-mode propagation, the
S-matrix of the four-port example in Figure 7.1 is given as a
