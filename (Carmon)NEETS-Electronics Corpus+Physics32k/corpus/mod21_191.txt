Metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) devices are the most susceptible to damage from ESD. For
example, an MOS field-effect transistor (MOSFET) can be damaged by a static voltage potential of as
little as 35 volts. Commonly used discrete bipolar transistors and diodes (often used in ESD-protective
circuits), although less susceptible to ESD, can be damaged by voltage potentials of less than 3,000
electrostatic volts. Damage does not always result in sudden device failure but sometimes results in
device degradation and early failure. Table 2-1 clearly shows that electrostatic voltages well in excess of
