The interesting range of such a Pareto graph on the cycle
budget axis should be deﬁned from the critical path up to the
fully sequential memory access path. In the fully sequential
case, all the memory accesses can be transferred over a single
port (lowest bandwidth). However, the number of memories is
fully free, and the memory architecture can be freely deﬁned.
Therefore, the energy is the lowest. In the other extreme, the
critical path, only a limited memory access ordering is valid.
Many memory accesses are performed in parallel. Conse-
quently, the constraints on the memory system are large, and
a limited freedom is available. As a result, the energy consump-
tion goes up. Because of a restricted cycle budget, the power
itself increases even more of course, but the latter involves a
more traditional trade-off that is not our focus here.
