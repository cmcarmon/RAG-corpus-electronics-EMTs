Controlled rectiﬁer circuits are classiﬁed as fully controlled and half-controlled rectiﬁers,
which are fed from either one-phase or three-phase supply. Figure 16.1.11 shows a fully controlled,
rectiﬁer-fed, separately excited dc motor drive and its characteristics. A transformer might be
required if the motor voltage rating is not compatible with the ac source voltage. To reduce ripple
in the motor current, a ﬁlter inductor can be connected in series between the rectiﬁer and the motor
armature. The ﬁeld can be supplied from the same ac source supplying the armature, through a
transformer and a diode bridge or a controlled rectiﬁer. While single-phase controlled rectiﬁers
are used up to a rating of 10 kW, and in special cases even up to 50 kW, three-phase controlled
rectiﬁers are used for higher ratings.
