may again be associated with a polynomial SN1â€“1
1. By the pattern multiplication theorem, it is possible to
get the polynomial associated with the total beam pattern of an array with weighted sensors by multiplying the
polynomials  associated  with  the  array  element  pattern  and  the  polynomial  associated  with  the  space  factor
Q(u). The array factor *Q(u)*2 may also be associated with the polynomial spectral factor
