When a spinning rod is placed in a polymer solution, elastic forces generated by the rotation motion cause fluid to climb up the rod (a phenomenon known as the Weissenberg effect). If the torque being applied is immediately brought to a stop, the fluid recoils down the rod.
When a viscoelastic fluid being poured from a beaker is quickly cut with a pair of scissors, the fluid recoils back into the beaker. When fluid at rest in a circular tube is subjected to a pressure drop, a parabolic flow distribution is observed that pulls the liquid down the tube. Immediately after the pressure is alleviated, the fluid recoils backward in the tube and forms a more blunt flow profile. When Silly Putty is rapidly stretched and held at an elongated position for a short period of time, it springs back. However, if it is held at an elongated position for a longer period of time, there is very little recovery and no visible recoil.
