Both D/A and A/D converters require a voltage reference in order to achieve absolute conversion accuracy.
Some conversion ICs have internal voltage references, while others accept external voltage references. For high-
performance systems, an external precision reference is needed to ensure long-term stability, load regulation,
and control over temperature ﬂuctuations. External precision voltage reference ICs can be found in manufac-
turers’ data books.
