FIGURE  45.3 Time  development  of  IE-based  modeling  capability  for  one-dimensional  (e.g.,  a  wire),  two-dimensional
(e.g.,  a  plate),  and  three-dimensional  (e.g.,  a  penetrable,  inhomogeneous  cube)  sampling  of  a  problem  of  characteristic
dimension L in wavelengths and matrix order N solvable in 1 h of computer time using mainframe computers introduced
in the years indicated. Linear-systems solution using LU decomposition (an N 3 dependency) is assumed with number of
unknowns proportional to L, L2 and L3, respectively, without any problem symmetry being exploited. These results should be
viewed as upper bounds on solution time and might be substantially reduced by advances in linear-system solution procedures.
