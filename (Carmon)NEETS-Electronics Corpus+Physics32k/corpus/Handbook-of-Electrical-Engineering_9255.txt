Once created, effective test cases will have residual value long after the Ô¨Årst release of a software product.
Therefore, formal test case libraries are highly desirable, to ensure that future changes to software do not cause
regression or damage to existing functionality. Test library tools occur in several CASE tool suites, are available
as stand-alone products, and are also often constructed as custom in-house tools by the larger software vendors
and computer manufacturers.
