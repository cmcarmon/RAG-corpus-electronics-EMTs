The echo box, or RESONANCE CHAMBER, basically consists of a resonant cavity, as shown in 
view A of figure 4-4. You adjust the resonant frequency of the cavity by varying the size of the cavity 
(the larger the cavity the lower the frequency). A calibrated tuning mechanism controls the position of a 
plunger and, therefore, the size of the cavity. The tuning mechanism is adjusted for maximum meter 
deflection, which indicates that the echo box is tuned to the precise transmitted frequency. The tuning 
mechanism also indicates on a dial (figure 4-5, view A) both the coarse transmitted frequency and a 
numerical reading. This reading permits the technician to determine the transmitted frequency with 
greater accuracy by referring to a calibration curve on a chart (figure 4-5, view B).
