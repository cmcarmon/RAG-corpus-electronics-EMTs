note: We use a discrete set of values for A1 and A2. If we have N1 values for amplitude A1, and N2
values for A2, we have N1N2 possible symbols that can be sent during each T second interval. To
convert this number into bits (the fundamental unit of information engineers use to qualify things),
compute log2 (N1N2).
