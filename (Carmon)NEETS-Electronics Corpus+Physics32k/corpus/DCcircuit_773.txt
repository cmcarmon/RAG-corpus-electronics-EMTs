This multimeter (Barnett brand) takes a slightly different design approach than the previ-
ous unit. Note how the rotary selector switch has fewer positions than the previous meter, but
also how there are many more jacks into which the test leads may be plugged into. Each one
of those jacks is labeled with a number indicating the respective full-scale range of the meter.
