Exposure to the elements over a period of time causes transmission-line deterioration. To determine
the accuracy of this test, you should use the power meter to measure the output of the signal generator at
the end of the test cable to be attached to the transmission line. Any power loss associated with the test
cables should be recorded and subtracted from the measurement taken with the transmission line
connected.
