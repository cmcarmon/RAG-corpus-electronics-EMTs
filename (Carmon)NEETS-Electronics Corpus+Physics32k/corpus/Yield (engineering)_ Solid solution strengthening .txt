By alloying the material, impurity atoms in low concentrations will occupy a lattice position directly below a dislocation, such as directly below an extra half plane defect. This relieves a tensile strain directly below the dislocation by filling that empty lattice space with the impurity atom.
The relationship of this mechanism goes as:




Δ
τ
=
G
b



C

s





ϵ


3
2





{\displaystyle \Delta \tau =Gb{\sqrt {C_{s}}}\epsilon ^{\frac {3}{2}}}

where



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the shear stress, related to the yield stress,



G


{\displaystyle G}
and



b


{\displaystyle b}
are the same as in the above example,




C

s




{\displaystyle C_{s}}
is the concentration of solute and



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is the strain induced in the lattice due to adding the impurity.
