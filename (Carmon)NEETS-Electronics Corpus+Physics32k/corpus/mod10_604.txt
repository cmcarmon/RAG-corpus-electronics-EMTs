You can define an antenna as a conductor or group of conductors used either for radiating 
electromagnetic energy into space or for collecting it from space. Electrical energy from the transmitter is 
converted into electromagnetic energy by the antenna and radiated into space. On the receiving end, 
electromagnetic energy is converted into electrical energy by the antenna and is fed into the receiver.
