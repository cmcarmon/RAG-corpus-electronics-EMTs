where fx1x2(x1, x2, t1, t2) represents the joint probability density function of the random variable x1 = x(t1) and
x2 = x(t2) and * denotes the complex conjugate transpose in general. Processes with autocorrelation functions
that depend only upon the difference of the time intervals t1 and t2 are known as wide sense stationary processes.
Thus, if x(t) is wide sense stationary, then
