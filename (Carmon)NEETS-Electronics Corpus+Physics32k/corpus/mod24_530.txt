The mode field diameter (MFD) of a single mode fiber is related to the spot size of the fundamental
mode. This spot has a mode field radius w0. The mode field diameter is equal to 2w 0. The size of the
mode field diameter correlates to the performance of the single mode fiber. Single mode fibers with large
mode field diameters are more sensitive to fiber bending. Single mode fibers with small mode field
diameters show higher coupling losses at connections.
