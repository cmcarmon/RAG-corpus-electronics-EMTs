Field effect transistors 
 
Field effect transistors (FET) comprise a channel of 
P-type  or  N-type  material  surrounded  by  material 
of the opposite polarity. The ends of the channel (in 
which  conduction  takes  place)  form  electrodes 
known  as  the  source  and  drain. The  effective 
width  of  the  channel  (in  which  conduction  takes 
place) is controlled by a charge placed on the third 
(gate) electrode.  The  effective  resistance  between 
the  source  and  drain  is  thus  determined  by  the 
voltage present at the gate. 
  Field effect transistors are available in two basic 
forms; junction gate and insulated gate. The gate 
source  junction  of  a  junction  gate  field  effect 
transistor  (JFET)  is  effectively  a  reverse-biased  
P-N  junction.  The  gate  connection  of  an  insulated 
gate  field  effect  transistor  (IGFET),  on  the  other 
hand,  is  insulated  from  the  channel  and  charge  is 
capacitively coupled to the channel. To keep things 
simple, we will consider only JFET devices in this 
book.  Figure  5.27  shows  the  basic  construction  of 
an  N-channel  JFET  whilst  Fig.  5.28  shows  its 
symbol and simplified model.  
  JFETs offer a very much higher input resistance 
when  compared  with  bipolar 
transistors.  For 
example, the input resistance of a bipolar transistor 
operating in common-emitter mode (see Chapter 7) 
is  usually  around  2.5  kI whereas  a  JFET  device 
operating in equivalent common-source  mode (see 
Chapter  7)  would 
input 
resistance  of  100  MI. This  feature  makes  JFET 
devices  ideal  for  use  in  applications  where  a  very 
high input resistance is desirable.
