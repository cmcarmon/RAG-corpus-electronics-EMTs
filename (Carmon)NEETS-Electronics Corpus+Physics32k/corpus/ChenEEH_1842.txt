Additional information pertaining to particular media types
and compression standards can also be inserted in the RTP
packets by using proﬁle headers and extensions. Cavusoglu
et al. (2003) have relied on the information contained in the
RTP header extensions to provide an adaptive forward error
correction (FEC) scheme for MPEG-2 video communications
over RTP networks. This approach relies on the group of pic-
tures (GOP) sequence and motion information to assign a
dynamic weight to the video sequence. The ﬂuctuations in the
weight of the video stream are used to modulate the level of FEC
assigned to the GOP. Much higher performance is achieved by
the use of the adaptive FEC scheme in comparison to other
methods that assign an uneven level of protection to video
stream. The basic notion presented by the adaptive weight
assignment procedure presented in Cavusoglu et al. (2003) can
be employed in other applications such as DiffServ networks and
selective retransmissions (see discussion on LSP networks later).
