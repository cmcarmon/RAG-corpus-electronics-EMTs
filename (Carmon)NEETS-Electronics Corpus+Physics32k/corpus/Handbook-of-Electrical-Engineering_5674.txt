Equipment used to control transmission voltages includes voltage regulators at generating units (excitation
control), tap-changing transformers, regulating transformers, synchronous condensers, shunt reactors, shunt
capacitor  banks,  and  static  VAR  devices.  When  upgrades  are  selected  during  the  planning  process  to  meet
planned transmission voltage criteria, some of this equipment should be assumed out of service.
