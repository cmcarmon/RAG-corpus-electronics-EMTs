While the original proof yielded the constant C = 8.52, Lieb and Oxford managed to refine this result to C = 1.68. Later, the same method of proof was used to further improve the constant to C = 1.64. With these constants the inequality holds for any particle number N.
The constant can be further improved if the particle number N is restricted. In the case of a single particle N = 1 the Coulomb energy vanishes, IP = 0, and the smallest possible constant can be computed explicitly as C1 = 1.092. The corresponding variational equation for the optimal ρ is the Lane–Emden equation of order 3. For two particles (N = 2) it is known that the smallest possible constant satisfies C2 ≥ 1.234. In general it can be proved that the optimal constants CN increase with the number of particles, i.e CN ≤ CN + 1. Any lower bound on the optimal constant for fixed particle number N is also a lower bound on the optimal constant in (1) for arbitrary particle number. The largest presently known numerically obtained lower bound on C was proved for N = 60 where C60 ≥ 1.41. This bound has been obtained by considering an exponential density. For the same particle number a uniform density gives C60 ≥ 1.34. Contrary to previous believes, these results suggest that a uniform density is not the most challenging one for setting the lower bound to C. To summarise, the best known bounds for C are 1.41 ≤ C ≤ 1.64.
