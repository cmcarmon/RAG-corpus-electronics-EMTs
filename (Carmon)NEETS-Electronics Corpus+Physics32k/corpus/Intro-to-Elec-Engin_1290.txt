The functions of the receiver in Figure 14.1.2 are the inverse of those in the transmitter.
At the receiving end of a digital communication system, the digital demodulator processes the
channel-corrupted transmitted waveform and reduces each waveform to a single number, which
represents an estimate of the transmitted data symbol. For example, when binary modulation is
