domain (using a DFT), we obtain Figure 4.14(B). We notice
that the recovery can be quite good. It is important to note
that, in this case, since the process is supposed to be noiseless,
the degradation had to be performed using full machine pre-
cision. If we quantize the degraded image using 256 levels, as is
usual in image processing applications, a small quantization
noise is superimposed on the degraded image. As we explained
in Section 4.2, this quantization noise is invisible to the human
eye. On the other hand, applying the pseudo-inverse ﬁlter to
the quantized degraded image, we obtain the image in Figure
4.14(C). We can clearly see that the restoration process has
failed completely. The excessive noise present in the restored
image results from the fact that, since the quantization noise is
relatively white, there is noise information even around the
frequencies where H(v1, v2) is very small; as a consequence,
G(v1, v2) is very large. This greatly ampliﬁes the noise around
these frequencies, thus producing an image like the one in
