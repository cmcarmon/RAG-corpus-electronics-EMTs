 400 or 6.4 millions cells. Using the above
it from the outer boundary, the problem space is about 160 
formula, the computer RAM necessary to make this calculation is approximately 172 MBytes. Since this does
not allow for storage of instructions and other arrays, and since the operating system will take some computer
memory, a machine with about 256 MBytes of random access memory (RAM) should be sufﬁcient to make
this calculation.
