are, of course, many other block diagram systems, but being commercial products, the essential features are
difﬁcult  to  describe  in  detail.  That  said,  another  system  that  is  well  documented  and  worthy  of  study  is  the
BlockEdit tool which was part of ECSTASY, a CACSD package developed in the UK in the late 1980s [Munro
and Jobling, 1994]. BEACON has been in production use within GE since the ﬁrst quarter of 1992. Through
the  use  of  BEACON,  the  company  has  been  able  to  substantially  reduce  the  overall  cost  and  cycle  time  for
developing  complex  controllers.  The  automatic  generation  of  code  not  only  eliminates  the  time-consuming
manual coding, but also avoids the manual introduction of bugs into the code.
