Your parts supplier may label capacitors according to the way their leads  
are arranged: axially or radially. Axial leads extend from each end of a cylin-
drically shaped capacitor, along its axis; radial leads extend from one end of  
a capacitor and are parallel to each other (until you bend them for use in 
aÂ circuit).
