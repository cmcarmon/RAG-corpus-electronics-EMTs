Other standards-making bodies, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Inter-
national  Organization  for  Standards/International  Electrotechnical  Committee  (ISO/IEC)  have  developed  or
cross-adopted LAN standards. ANSI’s X3T9.5 committee is responsible for the FDDI LAN standard, a high-
speed token ring that uses redundant optical ﬁbers. Some of the important LAN standards and their charac-
teristics are shown in Table 72.1.
