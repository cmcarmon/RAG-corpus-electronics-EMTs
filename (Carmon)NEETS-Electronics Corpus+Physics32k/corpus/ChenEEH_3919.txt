The problem can be described as follows. Given a set of
zero-mean random variables, X1, X2, . . . , XK , it is desired to
estimate a random variable S (also zero-mean). The objective
here is to ﬁnd an estimator ^SS that is linear in Xi and that is
optimum in some sense, like MMSE.
Clearly, if ^SS is constrained to be linear in Xi, it can be
expressed as ^SS ¼
K
i¼1 aiXi. This expression can be used inde-
pendently of the model that governs the relation between X
and S. One can see that once the coefﬁcients ai, i ¼ 1, 2, . . . , K
are determined for all i, ^SS is unambiguously (uniquely) speci-
ﬁed. As such, the problem of ﬁnding an optimum estimator
becomes one of ﬁnding the optimum set of coefﬁcients, and
estimation of a random signal becomes estimation of a set of
deterministic parameters.
