where  d  is  the  medium  thickness,  d  is  the  head-medium  spacing,  Mr  is  the  remanent  magnetization  of  the
medium, and Hc is the coercivity of the medium. That the transition widens with the product Mr · d is a result
of the fact that the demagnetizing ﬁelds increase linearly with this quantity. Similarly, the transition narrows
as Hc  is  increased,  because  with  high  coercivity,  the  medium  can  resist  the  transition  broadening  due  to  the
demagnetizing ﬁelds. The increase in transition width with d is due to the fact that a poorer head ﬁeld gradient
is obtained with larger head-medium spacing.
