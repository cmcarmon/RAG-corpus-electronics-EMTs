Show that there is only one input voltage for which both stages simultaneously operate
under the saturation discipline. What is that input voltage?
p r o b l e m 7.5 Consider the ‘‘source-follower’’ or ‘‘buffer’’ circuit shown in
Figure 7.76. Use the SCS MOSFET model (with parameters VT and K) to perform
