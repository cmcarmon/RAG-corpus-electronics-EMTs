Like electromagnetic waves, gravitational waves should exhibit shifting of wavelength due to the relative velocities of the source and observer, but also due to distortions of space-time, such as cosmic expansion. This is the case even though gravity itself is a cause of distortions of space-time. Redshifting of gravitational waves is different from redshifting due to gravity.
