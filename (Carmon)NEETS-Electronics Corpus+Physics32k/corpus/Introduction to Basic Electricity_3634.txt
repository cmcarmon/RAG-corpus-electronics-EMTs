The rectifier circuit is the heart of the power supply. 
Its function is to convert the incoming AC voltage to 
a DC voltage. There are three basic types of rectifier 
circuits used with power supplies: half-wave recti-
fiers, full-wave rectifiers, and bridge rectifiers.
Figure 36-4 shows a basic half-wave rectifier. The 
diode is located in series with the load. The current in 
the circuit flows in only one direction because of the 
diode.
