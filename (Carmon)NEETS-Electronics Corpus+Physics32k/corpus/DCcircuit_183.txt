Many solid insulating materials exhibit similar resistance properties: extremely high re-
sistance to electron ï¬‚ow below some critical threshold voltage, then a much lower resistance
at voltages beyond that threshold. Once a solid insulating material has been compromised by
high-voltage breakdown, as it is called, it often does not return to its former insulating state,
unlike most gases. It may insulate once again at low voltages, but its breakdown threshold
