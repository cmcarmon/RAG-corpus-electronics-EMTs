Root Loci on the Real Axis. The entire real axis of the s plane is occupied by the root loci. When K > 0, root
loci are found in sections of the real axis to the right of which the total number of poles and zeros of G(s)H(s)
is odd. When K < 0, root loci are found in sections to the right of which the total number of poles and zeros
of G(s)H(s) is even.
