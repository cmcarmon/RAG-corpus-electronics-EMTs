The region below the active region where VDS < +4 V = –VP has several names. It is called the nonsaturated
region, the triode region, and the ohmic region. The term triode region apparently originates from the similarity
of the shape of the curves to that of the vacuum tube triode. The term ohmic region is due to the variation of
IDS  with VDS  as  in  Ohm’s  law,  although  this  variation  is  nonlinear  except  for  the  region  of VDS  that  is  small
compared to the pinch-off voltage where IDS will have an approximately linear variation with VDS.
