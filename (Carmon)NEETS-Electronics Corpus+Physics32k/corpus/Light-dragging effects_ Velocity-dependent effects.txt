Special relativity predicts that the velocity of light is modified by travelling through a moving medium.
For a moving particulate body, light moving through the body's structure is known to move faster in the direction of the body's motion than it does in the opposite direction (Fizeau experiment). This effect was originally predicted by dragged-aether theories (see: e.g. Fresnel). Light aimed transversely through a moving transparent body is also seen to be translated in the direction of the body's motion (R.V. Jones, J.Phys A 4 L1-L3 (1971) ).
General relativity predicts that the acceleration of a body in a straight line will cause light to drag, an effect known as Frame dragging (or gravitoelectromagnetism).
For a moving gravity-source the gravitational field can be considered as an extension of the object, and carries inertia and momentum - since a direct collision with the moving object can impart momentum to an external particle, interaction with the object's gravitational field should allow "momentum exchange" too. Consequently, a moving gravitational field drags light and matter. This general effect is used by NASA to accelerate space probes, using the gravitational slingshot effect.
