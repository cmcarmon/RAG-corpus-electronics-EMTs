At any point on a fault surface, the shale gouge ratio is equal to the net shale/clay content of the rocks that have slipped past that point.
The SGR algorithm assumes complete mixing of the wall-rock components in any particular 'throw interval'. The parameter is a measure of the 'upscaled' composition of the fault zone.
