While there are several ways to classify fiber optic links, this chapter classifies links according to the
modulation type: either digital or analog.Modulation is the process of varying one or more
characteristics of an optical signal to encode and convey information. Generally, the intensity of the
optical signal is modulated in fiber optic communications systems. Digital modulation implies that the
optical signal consists of discrete levels. Analog modulation implies that the intensity of the optical signal
