Noise in analog systems is typically characterized by its impact
as a small-signal perturbation. In this form, noise is considered
to be an independent alternating current (ac) source (either
voltage or current). Table 2.1 lists the nomenclature for dis-
cussing analog noise. These measures are derived and deﬁned
throughout the chapter.
