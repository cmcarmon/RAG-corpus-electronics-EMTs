The half-wave rectifier gets its name from the fact that it conducts during only half the input cycle. 
Its output is a series of pulses with a frequency that is the same as the input frequency. Thus when 
operated from a 60-hertz line, the frequency of the pulses is 60 hertz. This is called RIPPLE 
FREQUENCY.
