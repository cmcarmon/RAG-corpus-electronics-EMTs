In the case of a human in an rf field, the body acts as a dielectric. If the power in the rf field exceeds 
10 milliwatts per centimeter, a person in that field will have a noticeable rise in body temperature. The 
eyes are highly susceptible to dielectric heating. For this reason, you should not look directly into devices 
radiating rf energy. The vital organs of the body also are susceptible to dielectric heating. For your own 
safety, you must NOT stand directly in the path of rf radiating devices.
