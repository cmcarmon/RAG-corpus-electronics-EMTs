In Portugal, summer time (locally known by "Hora de Ver√£o") was introduced in 1916. In the years 1922, 1923, 1925, 1930, 1933 and from 1967 to 1975 summer time was not applied. For many years the official hour in the Madeira Islands was one hour earlier than that in Lisbon, and the Azores Islands was two hours behind. Today, in the Madeira Islands the official time is the same as that of Lisbon, and in the Azores Islands is one hour behind Lisbon. The start and end dates for summer time in Portugal follow the pattern in the rest of the EU: the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.
