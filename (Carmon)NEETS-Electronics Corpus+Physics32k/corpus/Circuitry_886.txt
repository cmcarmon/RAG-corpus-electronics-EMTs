the surface of the heatsink. From this point, heat is 
conducted to the extremities of the fins where it is 
radiated into the surrounding air space. 
  The  total  thermal  resistance, (cid:4)T, present  in  any 
heatsink arrangement is actually the sum of several 
individual thermal resistances. Consider the case of 
a transistor bolted directly to a metal heat radiator 
(see Fig. 19.35). The total thermal resistance, (cid:4)T, is 
the sum of the following thermal resistances: 
 
1.  The  thermal  resistance  that  exists  between  the 
semiconductor 
the 
transistor  (i.e.  the  thermal  resistance  inside  the 
transistor package), (cid:4)JC 
2.  The  thermal  resistance  between  the  case  of  the 
transistor  and  the  heat  radiator  (i.e.  the  thermal 
resistance  of  an  insulating  washer,  where  fitted), 
(cid:4)CS
