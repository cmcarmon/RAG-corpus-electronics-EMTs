In Chapter 1, an account of voltage regulation modules
(VRMs) used in powering microchips is provided with a
particular emphasis on circuit switching topologies. Chapter
2 deals with noise in mixed-signal electronic systems with a
focus on submicron ultra-large scale integrated (ULSI) system-
on-a-chip (SOC) technologies. Noise in semiconductor devices
and passive components becomes a key issue in address-
ing system-level signal integrity concerns. A detailed review
and progress on metal-oxide-silicon Ô¨Åeld-effect transistors
(MOSFETs) is discussed in Chapter 3 with emphasis on im-
