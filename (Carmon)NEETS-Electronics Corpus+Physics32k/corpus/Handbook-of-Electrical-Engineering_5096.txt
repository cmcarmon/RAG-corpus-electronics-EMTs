Optical Isolator and Circulator
In ﬁber-optic-based communication systems with gigahertz bandwidth or coherent detection, it is often essential
to eliminate back reﬂections from the ﬁber ends and other surfaces or discontinuities because they can cause
amplitude ﬂuctuations, frequency instabilities, limitation on modulation bandwidth, noise or even damage to
the lasers. An optical isolator permits the forward transmission of light while simultaneously preventing reverse
transmission with a high degree of extinction. The schematic conﬁguration of a conventional optical isolator
utilizing bulk rotator and permanent magnet [Johnson, 1966] is shown in Fig. 57.2. It consists of a 45-degree
polarization rotator which is nonreciprocal so that back-reﬂected light is rotated by exactly 90 degrees and can
therefore be excluded from the laser. The nonreciprocity is furnished by the Faraday effect. The basic operation
principle is as follows: A Faraday isolator consists of rotator material immersed in a longitudinal magnetic ﬁeld
between  two  polarizers.  Light  emitted  by  the  laser  passes  through  the  second  polarizer  being  oriented  at  45
degrees relative to the transmission axis of the ﬁrst polarizer. Any subsequently reﬂected light is then returned
through  the  second  polarizer,  rotated  by  another  45  degrees  before  being  extinguished  by  the  ﬁrst  polar-
izer—thus optical isolation is achieved.
