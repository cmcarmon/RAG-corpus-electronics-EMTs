clustering can be an information theoretic measure such as likelihood or entropy. This is the concept behind
generalized  tri-phones  [8].  Decision  trees  (described  in  the  next  section)  can  also  be  used  to  determine  the
distinct categories. Another scheme is to tie the HMM distributions of these tri-phones. More recently, methods
that cluster individual states of the HMM [1] have been introduced. A drawback in using tri-phones is that
wider contexts (i.e., three, four, or Ô¨Åve phones to the left) may be important.
