Consequently, with the increased speed of digital computers, the development of increasingly eﬃcient algo-
rithms, and the ability to interconnect computers to form a communications infrastructure, digital commu-
nication is now the best choice for many situations.
6.33 Communication Networks42
Communication networks elaborate the Fundamental Model of Communications (Figure 1.3). The model
shown in Figure 6.25 describes point-to-point communications well, wherein the link between transmitter
and receiver is straightforward, and they have the channel to themselves. One modern example of this
communications mode is the modem that connects a personal computer with an information server via
a telephone line. The key aspect, some would say ﬂaw, of this model is that the channel is dedicated:
Only one communications link through the channel is allowed for all time. Regardless whether we have
a wireline or wireless channel, communication bandwidth is precious, and if it could be shared without
signiﬁcant degradation in communications performance (measured by signal-to-noise ratio for analog signal
transmission and by bit-error probability for digital transmission) so much the better.
