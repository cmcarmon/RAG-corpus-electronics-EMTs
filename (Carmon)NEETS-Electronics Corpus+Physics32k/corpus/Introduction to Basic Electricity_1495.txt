When pressure is applied to certain crystalline 
materials such as quartz, tourmaline, Rochelle salts, 
or barium titanate, a small voltage is produced. This 
is referred to as the piezoelectric	effect. Initially, 
negative and positive charges are distributed randomly 
throughout a piece of crystalline material, and no over-
all charge can be measured. However, when pressure 
is applied, electrons leave one side of the material and 
accumulate on the other side. A charge is produced 
as long as the pressure remains. When the pressure is 
removed, the charge is again distributed, so no over-
all charge exists. The voltage produced is small and 
must be amplified to be useful. Uses of the piezoelec-
tric effect include crystal microphones, phonograph 
pickups (crystal cartridges), and precision oscillators 
(Figure 12-10 and Figure 12-11).
