As the potential for the uses of electricity were explored, scientists in the United States and England 
worked to develop the telegraph. The first practical system was established in London, England, in 1838. 
Just 20 years later, the final link to connect the major countries with electrical communications was 
completed when a transatlantic submarine cable was connected. Commercial telegraphy was practically 
worldwide by 1890. The telegraph key, wire lines, and Morse code made possible almost instantaneous 
communications between points at great distances. Submarine cables solved the problems of transoceanic 
communications, but communications with ships at sea and mobile forces were still poor.
