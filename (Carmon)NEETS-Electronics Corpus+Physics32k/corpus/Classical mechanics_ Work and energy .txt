If a constant force F is applied to a particle that makes a displacement Δr, the work done by the force is defined as the scalar product of the force and displacement vectors:




W
=

F

⋅
Δ

r


.


{\displaystyle W=\mathbf {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} \,.}

More generally, if the force varies as a function of position as the particle moves from r1 to r2 along a path C, the work done on the particle is given by the line integral




W
=

∫

C



F

(

r

)
⋅

d


r


.


{\displaystyle W=\int _{C}\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )\cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} \,.}

If the work done in moving the particle from r1 to r2 is the same no matter what path is taken, the force is said to be conservative. Gravity is a conservative force, as is the force due to an idealized spring, as given by Hooke's law. The force due to friction is non-conservative.
The kinetic energy Ek of a particle of mass m travelling at speed v is given by





E


k

m

v

.


{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {k} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}mv^{2}\,.}

For extended objects composed of many particles, the kinetic energy of the composite body is the sum of the kinetic energies of the particles.
The work–energy theorem states that for a particle of constant mass m, the total work W done on the particle as it moves from position r1 to r2 is equal to the change in kinetic energy Ek of the particle:

{\displaystyle W=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }=E_{\mathrm {k,2} }-E_{\mathrm {k,1} }={\tfrac {1}{2}}m\left(v_{2}^{\,2}-v_{1}^{\,2}\right)\,.}

Conservative forces can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function, known as the potential energy and denoted Ep:





F

=
−

∇


E


p




.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}

If all the forces acting on a particle are conservative, and Ep is the total potential energy (which is defined as a work of involved forces to rearrange mutual positions of bodies), obtained by summing the potential energies corresponding to each force

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\mathbf {\nabla } E_{\mathrm {p} }\cdot \Delta \mathbf {r} =-\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }\,.}

The decrease in the potential energy is equal to the increase in the kinetic energy

.


{\displaystyle -\Delta E_{\mathrm {p} }=\Delta E_{\mathrm {k} }\Rightarrow \Delta (E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} })=0\,.}

This result is known as conservation of energy and states that the total energy,




∑
E

E

{\displaystyle \sum E=E_{\mathrm {k} }+E_{\mathrm {p} }\,,}

is constant in time. It is often useful, because many commonly encountered forces are conservative.
