The exact propulsive efficiency formula for air-breathing engines is

v

v

{\displaystyle \eta _{p}={\frac {2}{1+{\frac {v_{9}}{v_{0}}}}}}

where




v

9




{\displaystyle v_{9}}
is the exhaust expulsion velocity and




v

0




{\displaystyle v_{0}}
is the airspeed of the aircraft.
A corollary of this is that, particularly in air breathing engines, it is more energy efficient to accelerate a large amount of air by a small amount, than it is to accelerate a small amount of air by a large amount, even though the thrust is the same. This is why turbofan engines are more efficient than simple jet engines at subsonic speeds.
