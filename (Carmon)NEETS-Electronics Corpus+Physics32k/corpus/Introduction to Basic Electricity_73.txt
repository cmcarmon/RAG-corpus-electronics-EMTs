	
There	will	be	instances	of	a	power	transfer	in	a	circuit.	For	the	electricity	to	continue	its
smooth	flow,	its	original	energy	source	will	be	replaced	with	an	internal	energy	source.
With	such	a	change	(especially	in	the	case	of	a	series	circuit	where	power	needs	to	flow
continuously),	the	explanation	for	its	system’s	pattern	becomes	a	notch	challenging.
For	beginners,	a	great	way	of	understanding	power	transfer	in	a	circuit	is	to	understand
maximum	power	transfer,	along	with	the	concepts	that	dwell	on	the	topic.	As	it	follows,
by	gaining	clarity	on	how	much	was	the	original	power,	as	well	as	how	much	power	a
particular	circuit	can	handle,	you	can	see	whether	a	power	transfer	is	necessary	or	will
only	cause	its	load	to	be	compromised.
