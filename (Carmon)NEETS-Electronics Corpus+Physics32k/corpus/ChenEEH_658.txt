or trading-off cycles spent in different submodules. Therefore,
the last four sections of this chapter are devoted to different
aspects of data transfer and storage exploration: code rewriting
techniques to improve data reuse and access locality (Section
4), how to meet real-time bandwidth constraints (Section 5),
custom memory organization design (Section 6), and data
layout reorganization for reduced memory size (Section 7).
The main emphasis lies on custom processor contexts. Realistic
multimedia and telecom applications are used to demonstrate
the impressive effects of such techniques.
