Another method of line voltage regulation is tap changing.
Taps are connections on a transformer winding that change
the turns ratio slightly. The ratio change is normally 10%
(0.625% per step). The taps are usually located on the primary
because less current has to be switched by the tap changing
connections than would be necessary on the secondary. Tap
changers can be manual or automatic. Some distribution
transformers and distribution substation transformers have
manual tap changers so that added load can be compensated
for. Motor-driven automatic tap changers are necessary for
voltage regulation with widely ï¬‚uctuating loads. This is called
tap changing under load (TCUL) or load tap changing
(LTC). LTC is used in distribution and subtransmission sub-
stations to keep the secondary line voltage at the proper level in
response to load and primary voltage changes.
