The small size, small bending radius (a few centimeters), and light weight of optical ﬁbers and cables are
very important where space is at a premium, such as in aircraft, on ships, and in crowded ducts under city streets.
Because  optical  ﬁbers  are  dielectric  waveguides,  they  avoid  many  problems  such  as  radiative  interference,
ground  loops,  and,  when  installed  in  a  cable  without  metal,  lightning-induced  damage  that  exists  in  other
transmission media.
