baud
A unit of communications processing speed in digital data communications systems, measured as the number of discrete conditions of signal events per second. If each signal event represents only one bit condition, baud rate equals bits per second (BPS).
beam
A device used as an indicator for a lever scale.
bezel
A holder that is designed to receive and position the edges of a lens, meter, window or display.
bi-direction
Information flow in either direction on a wire between pieces of equipment that are equipped for both receiving and transmitting data. May be abbreviated bi-di or BiDi.
binary-coded decimal (BCD)

A data coding system in which the decimal numbers 0 through 9 are represented by four binary bits. E.g., the binary coded decimal equivalent of the number 187 is 0001 1000 0111.

bit

The smallest unit of information in a binary system, consisting of a 0 or a 1. Abbreviated from "binary digit".

blackout
A sudden loss of AC line power which normally occurs due to an overload or other power failure.
Board of Governors
The body of officials from the National Conference on Weights and Measures that sets National Type Evaluation Program (NTEP) policy and has final say in disputes.
bridge circuit
A network of four "leg" components connected in such a way that the input signal may be applied across two branches in parallel, and the output signal taken between two points, one on each side of the parallel branches. The output voltage is zero when the output points are at the same potential, which occurs at some ratio of the resultant four arms of the circuit, and the bridge is said to be balanced or set to null at that point.
brownout
A power company's deliberate lowering of line voltage in order to reduce load demands.
