shows the top view of several rectangular MOSFET gates fabricated within an
integrated circuit. Let us assume that the silicon-dioxide dielectric is characterized by
COX ≈ 4 f F/µm2, and find the gate capacitances CGS for each MOSFET.
To do so, we use Equation 9.51. To begin, notice that MOSFETs M3, M4, and M5
must have the same capacitance because they have the same area of 12 µm2. Their
capacitance is therefore 48 fF. MOSFET M5 has the biggest area of 36 µm2, and so
it has the biggest capacitance of 144 fF, while MOSFET M2 has the smallest area of
9 µm2, and so it has the smallest capacitance of 36 fF. MOSFETs M1 and M7 have
capacitances 64 fF and 108 fF, respectively.
