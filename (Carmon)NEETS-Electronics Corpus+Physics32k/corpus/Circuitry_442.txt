Wien bridge oscillator 
 
An  alternative  approach  to  providing  the  phase 
shift required is the use of a Wien bridge network 
(Fig.  9.3).  Like  the  Câ€“R  ladder,  this  network 
provides a phase shift which varies with frequency. 
The  input  signal  is  applied  to  A  and  B  while  the 
output  is  taken  from  C  and  D.  At  one  particular 
frequency, the phase shift produced by the network 
will  be  exactly  zero  (i.e.  the  input  and  output
