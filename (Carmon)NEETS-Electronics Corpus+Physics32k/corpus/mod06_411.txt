 13. Notify a medical officer immediately if you sustain a wound from a sharp radioactive object. If a
medical officer cannot reach the scene immediately, stimulated mild bleeding by applying pressure
about the wound and by using suction bulbs. DO NOT USE YOUR MOUTH if the wound is a
puncture-type wound. If the opening is small, make an incision to promote free bleeding, and to
make the wound easier to clean and flush.
