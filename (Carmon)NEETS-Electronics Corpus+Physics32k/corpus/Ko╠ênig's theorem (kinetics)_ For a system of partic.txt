The theorem expresses the kinetic energy of a system of particles in terms of the velocities of the individual particles.
Specifically, it states that the kinetic energy of a system of particles is the sum of the kinetic energy associated to the movement of the center of mass and the kinetic energy associated to the movement of the particles relative to the center of mass.
