When two unequal charges are connected by a conductor, a complete pathway for current exists. An
electric circuit is a complete conducting pathway. It consists not only of the conductor, but also includes
the path through the voltage source. Inside the voltage source current flows from the positive terminal,
through the source, emerging at the negative terminal.
