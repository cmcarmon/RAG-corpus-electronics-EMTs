In theoretical physics, it is usually possible to organize physical phenomena according to the energy scale or distance scale. The theory of renormalization group is based on this paradigm. The short-distance, ultraviolet (UV) physics does not directly affect qualitative features of the long-distance, infrared (IR) physics, and vice versa.
This separation of scales holds in quantum field theory. However, in its generalizations such as noncommutative field theory and quantum gravity - string theory in particular - it is expected that interrelations between UV and IR physics start to emerge. In many cases, these interrelations, UV/IR mixing, may be demonstrated explicitly.
