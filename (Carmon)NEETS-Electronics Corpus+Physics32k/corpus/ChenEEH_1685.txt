(e.g., recognition of emotions and feelings). Given the multi-
disciplinary nature of the techniques for modeling, indexing,
and retrieving visual data, efforts from many different commu-
nities have merged in the advancement of content-based video
indexing and retrieval (CBVIR) systems. Depending on the
background of the research teams, different levels of abstrac-
tions have been assumed to model the data. As shown in Figure
6.7, we classify these abstractions into three categories based on
the gradient model of human visual perception speciﬁcally in
the context of CBVIR systems. In this ﬁgure, we also capture the
mutual interaction of some of the disciplines of engineering,
computer science, and cognitive sciences.
