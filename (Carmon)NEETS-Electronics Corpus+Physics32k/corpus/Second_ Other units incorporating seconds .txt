A second is part of other units, such as frequency measured in hertz (inverse seconds or secondâˆ’1), speed (meters/second) and acceleration (meters/second2). The metric system unit becquerel, a measure of radioactive decay, is measured in inverse seconds. The meter is defined in terms of the speed of light and the second; definitions of the metric base units ampere and candela also depend on the second. Of the 22 named derived units of the SI, only three: degree centigrade, radian, and steradian, do not depend on the second. Many derivative units for everyday things are reported in terms of larger units of time, not seconds, such as clock time in hours and minutes, velocity of a car in miles/hour or kilometers/hour, kilowatt hours of electricity usage, and speed of a turntable in rotations per minute.
