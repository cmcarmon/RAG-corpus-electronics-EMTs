 (DTH) satellites are operating at Ku-band. In
the  U.S.,  satellites  operating  in  the  broadcast  satellite  service  (BSS)  with  downlink  frequencies  of  12.2  to
12.7 GHz, deliver TV directly to home receivers having parabolic dish antennas as small as 46 cm (18 in.) in
diameter. DBS with digital modulation and compressed video is providing more than 150 National Television
Systems Committee (NTSC) TV channels from a single orbital location having an allocation of 32 transponder
channels, each with 24-MHz bandwidth. DBS is seen as an attractive medium for delivery of high-deÔ¨Ånition
TV (HDTV) to a large number of homes. Other systems using analog FM are operational in Europe and Japan.
In  the  U.S.,  DTH  is  also  provided  by  satellites  in  the  FSS  frequency  bands  of  11.7  to  12.2  GHz.  These  are
constrained by regulation to operate at lower downlink power and, therefore, require receiving dishes of about
1-m diameter.
