Another way to physically organize data on the disk pack (and on diskettes) is to use the sector 
method. This requires that each of the tracks be divided into individual storage areas called sectors 
(shown in figure 2-10, view B). The number of sectors varies with the disk system used; however, there 
are usually eight or more. Each sector holds a specific number of characters. Before a record can be 
accessed, a computer program must again give the disk drive the record's address specifying the track 
number, the surface number, and the sector number of the record. One or more read/write heads are then 
moved to the proper track, the head over the specified surface is activated, and the data is read from or 
written to the designated sector as it spins under the head.
