As you might suspect, negative logic is the opposite of positive logic and is defined as follows: If the
signal that activates the circuit (the 1 state) has a voltage level that is more NEGATIVE than the 0 state,
then the logic polarity is considered to be NEGATIVE. Table 2-3 shows the manner in which negative
logic may be used.
