In sedimentary basins, site effects also lead to the generation of surface waves at the basin edges. This phenomenon may significantly strengthen the amplification of the seismic motion. The aggravation of the amplification level when compared to the case of horizontal layering may be up to a factor of 5 or 10. It depends on the velocity contrast between the layers and the geometry of the basin. Such phenomena are named basin effects and we may consider the analogy with the vibrations in a bowl of jelly.
The theoretical analysis of site effects in canyons or semi-circular sedimentary basins has been performed through semi-analytical methods in the early 80's. Recent numerical simulations  allowed the analysis of site effects in ellipsoidal sedimentary basins. Depending on the basin geometry, the aggravation of site effects is different from that of the horizontally layered case.
When the mechanical properties of the sedimentary basin are known, we may simulate site effects numerically. Figure 4 depicts the amplification phenomenon for the city of Caracas. The amplification level of a plane wave (

Numerous geological sites have been investigated by various researchers for weak earthquakes as well as for strong ones (cf synthesis). In the latter case, it is necessary to account for the nonlinear behavior of the soil under large loadings or even the soil liquefaction which may lead to the soil failure.
