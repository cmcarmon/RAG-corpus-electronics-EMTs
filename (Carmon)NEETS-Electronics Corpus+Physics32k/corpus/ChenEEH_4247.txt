than three consecutive zero bits in a cell, and at least two
transitions occur in a 5-bit cell. The binary bit values are
represented with non return to zero inverted (NRZI), where
the transition at the beginning of the bit time denotes a binary
1 for that bit time, and no transition indicates a binary 0. Only
16 out of 32 code patterns are used for data, and other patterns
are used for control symbols. Timing jitter is one of transmis-
sion impairments in the data communication. The deviation
of clock recovery occurs when a receiver attempts to recover
clocking as well as data. Due to the high speed of transmis-
sion, the deviation of the clock is more severe for FDDI
than for IEEE 802.5. The centralized clocking used by the
IEEE 802.5 network is inappropriate for 100 Mbps, and it
requires a complicated and expensive phase lock loop circuitry.
Distributed clocking is therefore used by FDDI. With distrib-
uted clocking, each station recovers a clock from its incoming
signal and transmits out at station clock speed. Each station
also maintains its own elastic buffer, unlike the IEEE 802.5
network that only designates one station to have the elastic
buffer.
