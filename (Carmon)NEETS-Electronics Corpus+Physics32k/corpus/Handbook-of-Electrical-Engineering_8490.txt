The recoding is performed within two steps: encoding and selec-
tion. The purpose of the encoding is to scan the triplet of bits of the
multiplier and deﬁne the operation to be performed on the multi-
plicand, as shown in Table 86.8. This method is actually an applica-
tion of a sign-digit representation in radix 4. The Booth-MacSorley
algorithm, usually called the Modiﬁed Booth algorithm or simply the
Booth algorithm, can be generalized to any radix.
