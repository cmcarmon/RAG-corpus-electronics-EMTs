B.  I.  Dervisoglu  (“Using  Scan  Technology  for  Debug  and  Diagnostics  in  a Workstation  Environment,”  in
Proc.  International  Test  Conference,  1988,  pp.  976–986)  provides  a  very  good  example  of  applying  DFT
techniques  all  the  way  from  the  IC  component  level  to  the  system  level.  Also,  B.  I.  Dervisoglu  (“Scan-Path
Architecture  for  Pseudorandom  Testing,”  IEEE  Design  &  Test  of  Computers,  vol.  6,  no.  4,  pp.  32–48,  August
1989)  describes  using  pseudo-random  testing  at  the  system  level.  Similarly,  P.  H.  Bardell  and  M.  J.  Lapointe
(“Production  Experience  with  Built-in  Self-Test  in  the  IBM  ES/9000  System,”  in  Proc.  International  Test
Conference,  October  1991,  pp.  28–36)  describe  application  of  BIST  for  testing  a  commercial  product  at  the
system level.
