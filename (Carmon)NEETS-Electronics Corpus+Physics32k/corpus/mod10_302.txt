When the angle is relatively low with respect to the horizon (ray 1), there is only slight penetration of 
the layer and the propagation path is long. When the angle of incidence is increased (rays 2 and 3), the 
rays penetrate deeper into the layer but the range of these rays decreases. When a certain angle is reached 
(ray 3), the penetration of the layer and rate of refraction are such that the ray is first returned to Earth at a 
minimal distance from the transmitter. Notice, however, that ray 3 still manages to reach the receiving site 
on its second refraction (called a hop) from the ionospheric layer.
