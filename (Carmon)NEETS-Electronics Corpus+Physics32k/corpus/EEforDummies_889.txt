Collecting cloths 
and cleansers
If you don’t keep the circuitry, 
 components, and other parts of your 
electronics projects as clean as a 
whistle, they may not operate as advertised. It’s especially important to start 
with a clean slate if you’re soldering parts together or to a circuit board. Dirt 
makes for bad solder joints, and bad solder joints make for faulty circuits.
