voltage rating, the conventional VRM cannot meet the 80%
efﬁciency requirement at heavy load. For lower output volt-
ages, it will be even more difﬁcult to meet the efﬁciency
requirement. Figure 1.10 shows the conventional VRMs’ efﬁ-
ciency at a 1.2-V output. Their efﬁciency is lower than 80% in
the whole load range.
