Another characteristic of a given antenna that remains the same whether the antenna is used for 
transmitting or receiving is GAIN. Some antennas are highly directional that is, more energy is 
propagated in certain directions than in others. The ratio between the amount of energy propagated in 
these directions compared to the energy that would be propagated if the antenna were not directional is 
known as its gain. When a transmitting antenna with a certain gain is used as a receiving antenna, it will 
also have the same gain for receiving.
