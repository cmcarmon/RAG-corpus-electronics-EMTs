You test a magnetron tube while it is in the transmitter equipment in which it is to be used. When
you install the magnetron in the transmitter, the condition of the tube can be determined by the normal
plate-current measurement and the power, frequency spectrum, and standing-wave-ratio tests of the
output signal. An unusual value for any of these measurements may indicate a defective tube.
