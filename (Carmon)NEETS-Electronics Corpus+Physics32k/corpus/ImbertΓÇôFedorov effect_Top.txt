The Imbert–Fiodaraŭ effect (named after Fiodar Ivanavič Fiodaraŭ (1911 – 1994) and Christian Imbert (1937 – 1998) is an optical phenomenon in which circularly or elliptically polarized light undergoes a small phase shift, when totally internally reflected. The phase shift is perpendicular to the plane containing the incident and reflected beams. This effect is the circular polarization analog of the Goos–Hänchen effect.
