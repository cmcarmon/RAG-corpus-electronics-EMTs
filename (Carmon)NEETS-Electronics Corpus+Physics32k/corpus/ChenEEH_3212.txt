system, the circuits radiate from the bulk-power stations to
the distribution substations. The radial system is simple and
has a low cost but it also has a low service continuity. In
general, due to higher service reliability, the transmission
system is designed as loop circuits or multiple circuits forming
a subtransmission grid or network. In the loop-type subtrans-
mission system, a single circuit originating from a bulk-power
bus runs through a number of substations and returns to the
same bus. The major considerations affecting the design are
cost and reliability.
