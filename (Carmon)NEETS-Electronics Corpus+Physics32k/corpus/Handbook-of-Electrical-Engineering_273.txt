Node Analysis
In  a  node  analysis,  the  node  voltages  are  the  variables  in  a  circuit,
and  KCL  is  the  vehicle  used  to  determine  them.  One  node  in  the
network  is  selected  as  a  reference  node,  and  then  all  other  node
voltages are deÔ¨Åned with respect to that particular node. This refer-
ence  node  is  typically  referred  to  as  ground  using  the  symbol  (
),
indicating that it is at ground-zero potential.
