PAL-structured arrays are also manufactured with clocked ﬂip-ﬂops attached to the array outputs. These are
often known as registered PALs. State machine descriptions map less naturally into these arrays, but this fact is
of less importance nowadays with the reliance on computer-aided design. Registered PALs ﬁnd wide use in the
data paths of digital systems, where special-purpose registers, counters, and data routing functions are needed.
Some PAL devices have enhancements such as the exclusive-ORing of outputs to make them more useful in
these applications.
