The reaction shows recurring periodic changes, both gradual and sudden, which are visible: slow changes in the intensity of colour, interrupted by abrupt changes in hue. This demonstrates that a complex combination of slow and fast reactions are taking place simultaneously. For example, following the iodide ion concentration with a silver/silver iodide electrode (see Videos) shows sudden dramatic swings of several orders of magnitude separated by slower variations. This is shown by the oscillogram above. Oscillations persist over a wide range of temperatures. Higher temperatures make everything happen faster, with some qualitative change observable (see Effect of temperature). Stirring the solution throughout the reaction is helpful for sharp colour changes, otherwise spatial variations may develop (see Videos). Bubbles of free oxygen are evolved throughout, and in most cases, the final state is rich in free iodine
