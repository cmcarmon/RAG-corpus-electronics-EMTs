The ﬁrst principle to understand about series circuits is that the amount of current is the
same through any component in the circuit. This is because there is only one path for electrons
to ﬂow in a series circuit, and because free electrons ﬂow through conductors like marbles in a
tube, the rate of ﬂow (marble speed) at any point in the circuit (tube) at any speciﬁc point in
time must be equal.
