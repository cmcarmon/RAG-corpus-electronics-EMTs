A ground	fault	circuit	interrupter	(gfci) 
 (Figure 7-5) is a fast-acting circuit breaker that is sen-
sitive to very low levels of current leakage to ground. 
GFCIs are designed to limit electrical shock to prevent 
serious injury. The disadvantage with GFCIs is that 
they operate only on line-to-ground fault currents.
