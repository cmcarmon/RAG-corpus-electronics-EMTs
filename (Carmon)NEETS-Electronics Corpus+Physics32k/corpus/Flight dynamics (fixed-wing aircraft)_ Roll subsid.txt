Jerking the stick sideways and returning it to center causes a net change in roll orientation.
The roll motion is characterized by an absence of natural stability, there are no stability derivatives which generate moments in response to the inertial roll angle. A roll disturbance induces a roll rate which is only canceled by pilot or autopilot intervention. This takes place with insignificant changes in sideslip or yaw rate, so the equation of motion reduces to:




A



d
p


d
t



=

L

p


p
.


{\displaystyle A{\frac {dp}{dt}}=L_{p}p.}






L

p




{\displaystyle L_{p}}
is negative, so the roll rate will decay with time. The roll rate reduces to zero, but there is no direct control over the roll angle.
