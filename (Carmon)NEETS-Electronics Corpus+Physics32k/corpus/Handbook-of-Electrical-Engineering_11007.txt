ECG between the S and T waves, i.e., there is an S-T segment shift. This is the cardinal sign of a myocardial
infarction (heart attack) and is almost always accompanied by chest pain (angina pectoris). Figure 113.14(10)
illustrates  the  ECG  in  myocardial  infarction. Whether  the  S-T  segment  displacement  is  up  (1)  or  down  (2)
depends on the region of the ventricles injured, as well as the lead used to record the ECG.
