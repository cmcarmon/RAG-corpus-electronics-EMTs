Developments
During the last two or three decades, several developments in HVDC technology have taken place that improved
viability of the HVDC transmission. Prior to 1970 mercury arc valves were used for converting from ac to dc
and dc to ac. They had several operational problems including frequent arcbacks. Arcback is a random phe-
nomenon that results in failure of a valve to block conduction in the reverse direction. This is most common
in the rectiﬁer mode of operation. In rectiﬁer operation, the valve is exposed to inverse voltage for approximately
two-thirds  of  each  cycle.  Arcbacks  result  in  line-to-line  short  circuits,  and  sometimes  in  three-phase  short
circuits, which subject the converter transformer and valves to severe stresses.
