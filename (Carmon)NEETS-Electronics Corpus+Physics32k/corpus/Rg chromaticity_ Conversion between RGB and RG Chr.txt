Given a color (R,G,B) where R, G, B = intensity of red, green and blue, this can be converted to color



(
r
,
g
,
b
)


{\displaystyle (r,g,b)}
where



r
,
g
,
b


{\displaystyle r,g,b}
imply the proportion of red, green and blue in the original color:




r
=


R

R
+
G
+
B





{\displaystyle r={\frac {R}{R+G+B}}}





g
=


G

R
+
G
+
B





{\displaystyle g={\frac {G}{R+G+B}}}





b
=


B

R
+
G
+
B





{\displaystyle b={\frac {B}{R+G+B}}}





r
+
g
+
b
=
1


{\displaystyle r+g+b=1}


The sum of rgb will always equal one, because of this property the b dimension can be thrown away without causing any loss in information. The reverse conversion is not possible with only two dimensions, as the intensity information is lost during the conversion to rg chromaticity, e.g. (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) has equal proportions of each color, but it is not possible to determine whether this corresponds to dark gray, light gray, or white. If R, G, B, is normalized to r, g, G color space the conversion can be computed by the following:




R
=



r
G

g




{\displaystyle R={\frac {rG}{g}}}





G
=
G


{\displaystyle G=G}





B
=



(
1
−
r
−
g
)
G

g




{\displaystyle B={\frac {(1-r-g)G}{g}}}


The conversion from rgG to RGB, is the same as the conversion from xyY to XYZ. The conversion requires at least some information relative to the intensity of the scene. For this reason if the G is preserved then the inverse is possible.
