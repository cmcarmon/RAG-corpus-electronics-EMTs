In this circuit, we have two loops for electrons to ﬂow through: one from 6 to 5 to 2 to 1 and
back to 6 again, and another from 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again. Notice how both
current paths go through R1 (from point 2 to point 1). In this conﬁguration, we’d say that R2
and R3 are in parallel with each other, while R1 is in series with the parallel combination of R2
and R3.
