Data are generally transmitted over long distances by wide area packet networks. These networks generally lease
telephone lines from telecommunications carriers that are used to carry data exclusively. Packet switching technology
was Ô¨Årst used on a large scale in the ARPANET beginning in the 1960s. The Internet (which replaced the earlier
ARPANET) serves to connect universities, industrial and government research centers, and private users.
