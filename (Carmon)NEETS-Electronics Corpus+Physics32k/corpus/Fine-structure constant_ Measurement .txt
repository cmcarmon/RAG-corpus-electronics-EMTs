The 2014 CODATA recommended value of α is
α = e2/4πε0ħc = 0.0072973525664(17).
This has a relative standard uncertainty of 0.23 parts per billion.
For reasons of convenience, historically the value of the reciprocal of the fine-structure constant is often specified. The 2014 CODATA recommended value is given by
α−1 = 137.035999139(31).
While the value of α can be estimated from the values of the constants appearing in any of its definitions, the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a way to measure α directly using the quantum Hall effect or the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The theory of QED predicts a relationship between the dimensionless magnetic moment of the electron and the fine-structure constant α (the magnetic moment of the electron is also referred to as "Landé g-factor" and symbolized as g). The most precise value of α obtained experimentally (as of 2012) is based on a measurement of g using a one-electron so-called "quantum cyclotron" apparatus, together with a calculation via the theory of QED that involved 12672 tenth-order Feynman diagrams:
α−1 = 137.035999173(35).
This measurement of α has a precision of 0.25 parts per billion. This value and uncertainty are about the same as the latest experimental results.
