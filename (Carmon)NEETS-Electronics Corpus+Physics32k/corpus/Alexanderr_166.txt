4.1
A major advantage of analyzing circuits using Kirchhoff’s laws as we
did  in  Chapter  3  is  that  we  can  analyze  a  circuit  without  tampering
with  its  original  conﬁguration. A major  disadvantage  of  this  approach
is that, for a large, complex circuit, tedious computation is involved.
The growth in areas of application of electric circuits has led to an
evolution  from  simple  to  complex  circuits. To  handle  the  complexity,
engineers over the years have developed some theorems to simplify cir-
cuit analysis. Such theorems include Thevenin’s and Norton’s theorems.
Since these theorems are applicable to linear circuits, we ﬁrst discuss the
concept of circuit linearity. In addition to circuit theorems, we discuss the
concepts of superposition, source transformation, and maximum power
transfer in this chapter. The concepts we develop are applied in the last
section to source modeling and resistance measurement.
