The  full  impact  of  new  solar  cell  designs  is  often  hard  to  separate  from  the  three  parameters  used  to
characterize the performance of any solar cell: short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, ﬁll factor and their
product, Pmax. However, these parameters merely summarize, and often obscure, the potential performance of
any particular design. Light-generated current, together with all the various recombination processes, are the
fundamental determinants of solar cell performance. A high efﬁciency solar cell design must maximize light-
generated current and minimize losses in the bulk base and emitter, within the collecting junction, and at the
surfaces. Because of these requirements, a particular device design for any material is typically optimized to
obtain,  ﬁrst,  light-generated  current,  then  open-circuit  voltage,  and  ﬁnally  ﬁll  factor.  Many  examples  of  this
approach can be found for a variety of solar cell materials, including silicon, GaAs, amorphous silicon, CuInSe2,
CuInGaSe2, CdTe, and InP.
