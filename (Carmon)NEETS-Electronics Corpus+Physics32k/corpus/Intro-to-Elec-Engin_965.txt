11.6.4 A single-phase, two-winding, 10-kVA, 440:110-
V, 60-Hz transformer is to be connected as an
autotransformer to supply a load at 550 V from a
440-V supply. Draw a schematic diagram of the
connections and determine: (a) The maximum
kVA rating as an autotransformer. (b) The maxi-
mum apparent power transferred by conduction.
(c) The maximum apparent power transferred by
electromagnetic induction.
