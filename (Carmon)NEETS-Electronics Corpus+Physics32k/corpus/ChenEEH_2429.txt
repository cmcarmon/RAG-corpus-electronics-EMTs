The scattered ﬁeld is a linear combination of the incident ﬁeld
components eiu and eif. As for a radiating antenna, the scat-
tered ﬁeld also has the e-jk0r -dependence,
in the far-ﬁeld
region, that account for the propagation phase and the free-
space loss. The eeu
s may respectively be referred to as the
u- and f-scattering vectors and are the r-independent part of
the scattered ﬁeld due to one unit of eiu and eif, respectively.
The part due to the open-circuited antenna may be separately
expressed in the following form, where the subscript refers to
the corresponding values in the open-circuited condition:
