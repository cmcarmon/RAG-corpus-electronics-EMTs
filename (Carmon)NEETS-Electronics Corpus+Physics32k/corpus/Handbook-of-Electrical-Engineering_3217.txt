A simple control circuit can be built using PWM IC SG3525 and TSC429 MOSFET driver ICs.
With the development of digital ICs operating on low-voltage (of the order of 3 V) supplies, use of
MOSFETs as synchronous rectiﬁers with very low voltage drop (~0.2 V) has become essential [Motorola,
1989] to increase the efﬁciency of the power supply.
