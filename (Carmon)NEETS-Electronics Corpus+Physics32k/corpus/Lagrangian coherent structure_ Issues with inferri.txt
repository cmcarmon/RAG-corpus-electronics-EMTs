FTLE ridges have proven to be a simple and efficient tool for the visualize hyperbolic LCSs in a number of physical problems, yielding intriguing images of initial positions of hyperbolic LCSs in different applications (see, e.g., Figs. 5a-b). However, FTLE ridges obtained over sliding time windows

do not form material surfaces. Thus, ridges of

have been identified by some authors broadly with LCSs. In support of this identification, it is also often argued that the material flux over such sliding-window FTLE ridges should necessarily be small.
The "FTLE ridge=LCS" identification, however, suffers form the following conceptual and mathematical problems:
Second-derivative FTLE ridges are necessarily straight lines and hence do not exist in physical problems.

are generally not Lagrangian and the flux through them is generally not small.
In particular, a broadly referenced material flux formula for FTLE ridges is incorrect, even for straight FTLE ridges
FTLE ridges mark hyperbolic LCS positions, but also highlight surfaces of high shear. A convoluted mixture of both types of surfaces often arises in applications (see Fig. 6 for an example).
There are several other types LCSs (elliptic and parabolic) beyond the hyperbolic LCSs highlighted by FTLE ridges
