are very useful when it is desired to check arithmetic operations such as addition, multipli-
cation, and division [Avizienis, 1971]. The basic concept is the same as all coding techniques. The data presented
to the arithmetic operation is encoded before the operations are performed. After completing the arithmetic
operations, the resulting code words are checked to make sure that they are valid code words. If the resulting
code  words  are  not  valid,  an  error  condition  is  signaled.  An  arithmetic  code  must  be  invariant  to  a  set  of

arithmetic  operations.  An  arithmetic  code, 
are the arithmetic code words for the operands
operands, * is some arithmetic operation, and 
b 
c
, respectively. Stated verbally, the performance of the arithmetic operation on two arithmetic code words
will  produce  the  arithmetic  code  word  of  the  result  of  the  arithmetic  operation.  To  completely  deﬁne  an
arithmetic code, the method of encoding and the arithmetic operations for which the code is invariant must
be speciﬁed. The most common examples of arithmetic codes are the 
codes, residue codes, and the inverse
residue codes.
