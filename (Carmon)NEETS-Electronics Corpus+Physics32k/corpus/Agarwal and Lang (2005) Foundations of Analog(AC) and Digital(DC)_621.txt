For the polarities of the current source and the voltage source shown in Figure 4.28, the
current iD through the nonlinear device will be positive.1 Accordingly, the R1 segment
of device operation applies and the equivalent circuit is as shown in Figure 4.29. In
Figure 4.29, we have replaced the nonlinear device with a resistor of value R1.
