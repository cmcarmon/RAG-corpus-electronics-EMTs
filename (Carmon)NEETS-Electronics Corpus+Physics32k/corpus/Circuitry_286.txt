This  chapter  deals  with  the  unsung  hero  of  most 
electronic  systems,  the  power  supply.  Nearly  all 
electronic circuits require a source of well regulated 
d.c. at voltages of typically between 5 V and 30 V. 
In  some  cases,  this  supply  can  be  derived  directly 
from  batteries  (e.g.  6  V,  9  V,  12  V)  but  in  many 
others it is desirable to make use of a standard a.c. 
mains  outlet.  This  chapter  explains  how  rectifier 
and  smoothing  circuits  operate  and  how  power 
supply  output  voltages  can  be  closely  regulated. 
The  chapter  concludes  with  a  brief  description  of 
some practical power supply circuits. 
  The  block  diagram  of  a  d.c.  power  supply  is 
shown  in  Fig.  6.1.  Since  the  mains  input  is  at  a 
relatively high voltage, a step-down transformer of 
appropriate  turns  ratio  is  used  to  convert  this  to  a 
low  voltage.  The  a.c.  output  from  the  transformer 
secondary  is  then  rectified  using  conventional 
silicon  rectifier  diodes  (see  Chapter  5)  to  produce 
an unsmoothed (sometimes referred to as pulsating 
d.c.) output.  This  is  then  smoothed  and  filtered 
before  being  applied  to  a  circuit  which  will 
regulate  (or stabilize) the output voltage so that it
