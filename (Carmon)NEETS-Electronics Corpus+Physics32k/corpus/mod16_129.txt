When using the safety shorting probe, always be sure to first connect the test clip to a good ground
(if necessary, scrape the paint off the grounding metal to make a good contact). Then hold the safety
shorting probe by the insulated handle and touch the probe end of the shorting rod to the point to be
shorted out. The probe end is fashioned so that it can be hooked over the part or terminal to provide a
constant connection by the weight of the handle alone. Always take care not to touch any of the metal
parts of the safety shorting probe while touching the probe to the exposed "hot" terminal. It pays to be
safe; use the safety shorting probe with care.
