A vortex is a region where the fluid flows around an imaginary axis. For an irrotational vortex, the flow at every point is such that a small particle placed there undergoes pure translation and does not rotate. Velocity varies inversely with radius in this case. Velocity will tend to

{\displaystyle \inf }

r
=
0


{\displaystyle r=0}
that is the reason for center being a singular point. The velocity is mathematically expressed as –

{\displaystyle v_{\theta }={\frac {K}{2\pi r}}.}

Since the fluid flows around an axis,

{\displaystyle v_{r}=0.}
