Consider a rigid ball of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
falling from a height towards a table. Assume that the forces acting on the ball are gravitation and the contact forces of the table preventing penetration. Then the differential equation describing the motion is




m




d

y


d

t

=
−
m
g
+
N
(
t
)


{\displaystyle m{\frac {d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}}=-mg+N(t)}

where



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the ball and



N
(
t
)


{\displaystyle N(t)}
is the contact force of the table, and



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration. Note that both



y
(
t
)


{\displaystyle y(t)}
and



N
(
t
)


{\displaystyle N(t)}
are a priori unknown. While the ball and the table are separated, there is no contact force. There cannot be penetration (for a rigid ball and a rigid table), so



y
(
t
)
−
r
≥
0


{\displaystyle y(t)-r\geq 0}
for all



t


{\displaystyle t}
. If



y
(
t
)
−
r
>
0


{\displaystyle y(t)-r>0}
then



N
(
t
)
=
0


{\displaystyle N(t)=0}
. On the other hand, if



y
(
t
)
−
r
=
0


{\displaystyle y(t)-r=0}
, then



N
(
t
)


{\displaystyle N(t)}
can take on any non-negative value. (We do not allow



N
(
t
)
<
0


{\displaystyle N(t)<0}
as this corresponds to some kind of adhesive.) This can be summarized by the complementarity relationship




0
≤
y
(
t
)
−
r

⊥

N
(
t
)
≥
0.


{\displaystyle 0\leq y(t)-r\quad \perp \quad N(t)\geq 0.}

In the above formulation, we can set



K
=
{

z
∣
z
≥
0

}


{\displaystyle K=\{\,z\mid z\geq 0\,\}}
, so that its dual cone




K

∗


=
K


{\displaystyle K^{*}=K}
is also the set of non-negative real numbers; this is a differential complementarity problem.
