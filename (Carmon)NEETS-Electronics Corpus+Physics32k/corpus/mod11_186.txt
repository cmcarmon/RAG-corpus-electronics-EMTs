COUPLING METHODS.â€”Energy (rf) can be removed from a magnetron by means of a 
COUPLING LOOP. At frequencies lower than 10,000 megahertz, the coupling loop is made by bending 
the inner conductor of a coaxial cable into a loop. The loop is then soldered to the end of the outer 
conductor so that it projects into the cavity, as shown in figure 2-35A. Locating the loop at the end of the 
cavity, as shown in figure 2-35B, causes the magnetron to obtain sufficient pickup at higher frequencies.
