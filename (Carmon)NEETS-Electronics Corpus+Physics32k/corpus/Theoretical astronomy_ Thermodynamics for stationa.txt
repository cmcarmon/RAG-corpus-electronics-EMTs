A general form of the first law of thermodynamics for stationary black holes can be derived from the microcanonical functional integral for the gravitational field. The boundary data
the gravitational field as described with a micocanonical system in a spatially finite region and
the density of states expressed formally as a functional integral over Lorentzian metrics and as a functional of the geometrical boundary data that are fixed in the corresponding action,
are the thermodynamical extensive variables, including the energy and angular momentum of the system. For the simpler case of nonrelativistic mechanics as is often observed in astrophysical phenomena associated with a black hole event horizon, the density of states can be expressed as a real-time functional integral and subsequently used to deduce Feynman's imaginary-time functional integral for the canonical partition function.
