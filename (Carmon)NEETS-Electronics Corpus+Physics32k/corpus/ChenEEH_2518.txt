Techniques based on the Smith chart are popular in the
design of impedance transformers and matching networks, a
basic block diagram of which is shown in Figure 7.9. Matching
networks may be built from lumped or distributed elements or
a combination of both. The quarter-wavelength section of a
transmission line may be the easiest to realize. Classical shunt
or series branch lines are widely used for more sophisticated
matching networks. Commonly used topologies include single
or multiple stubs and one or more quarter-wavelength
sections. In addition, taped or nonuniform transmission line
sections are also often found in broadband design.
