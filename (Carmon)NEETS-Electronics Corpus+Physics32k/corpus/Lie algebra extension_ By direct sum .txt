Let g, h be Lie algebras over the same field K. Define






e


=


h


×


g


,


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {e}}={\mathfrak {h}}\times {\mathfrak {g}},}

and define addition pointwise on e. Scalar multiplication is defined by




α
(
H
,
G
)
=
(
α
H
,
α
G
)
,
α
∈
F
,
H
∈


h


,
G
∈


g


.


{\displaystyle \alpha (H,G)=(\alpha H,\alpha G),\alpha \in F,H\in {\mathfrak {h}},G\in {\mathfrak {g}}.}

With these definitions, h × g ≡ h ⊕ g is a vector space over F. With the Lie bracket

e is a Lie algebra. Define further




i
:


h


↪


e


;
H
↦
(
H
,
0
)
,

s
:


e


↠


g


;
(
H
,
G
)
↦
G
.


{\displaystyle i:{\mathfrak {h}}\hookrightarrow {\mathfrak {e}};H\mapsto (H,0),\quad s:{\mathfrak {e}}\twoheadrightarrow {\mathfrak {g}};(H,G)\mapsto G.}

It is clear that (1) holds as an exact sequence. This extension of g by h is called a trivial extension. It is, of course, nothing else than the Lie algebra direct sum. By symmetry of definitions, e is an extension of h by g as well, but h ⊕ g ≠ g ⊕ h. It is clear from (3) that the subalgebra 0 ⊕ g is an ideal (Lie algebra). This property of the direct sum of Lie algebras is promoted to the definition of a trivial extension.
