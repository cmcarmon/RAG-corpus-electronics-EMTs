Navy systems require that fiber optic cables meet stringent environmental conditions. The types of
cable designs considered by the Navy include the optical fiber cable component (OFCC), stranded, and
ribbon cable designs. The cable must meet minimal levels of performance in safety (low smoke, low
toxicity, low halogen content, etc.), durability (able to withstand shock, vibration, fluids, etc.), and optical
performance. The cable must also be easy to install and repair. These factors greatly influence the design
of the cables.
