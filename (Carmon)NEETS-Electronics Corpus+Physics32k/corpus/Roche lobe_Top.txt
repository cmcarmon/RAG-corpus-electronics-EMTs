The Roche lobe (or Roche limit) is the region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. It is an approximately tear-drop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential, with the apex of the tear drop pointing towards the other star (the apex is at the L1 Lagrangian point of the system).
The Roche lobe is different from the Roche sphere which approximates the gravitational sphere of influence of one astronomical body in the face of perturbations from another heavier body around which it orbits. It is different from the Roche limit which is the distance at which an object held together only by gravity begins to break up due to tidal forces. The Roche lobe, Roche limit and Roche sphere are named after the French astronomer Ã‰douard Roche.
