Embeddedness: A state in which one system is nested in another system.
Emergence: The appearance of novel characteristics exhibited on the level of the whole ensemble, but not by the components in isolation.
Enantiostasis: The ability of an open system, especially a living organism, to stabilize and conserve function in spite of an unstable environment.
Entanglement: A state in which the manner of being, or form of existence, of one system is inextricably tied to that of another system or set of systems.
Entropy: In physics, entropy is a measure of energy that is expended in a physical system but does no useful work, and tends to decrease the organizational order of the system.
Environment: The context within which a system exists. It is composed of all things that are external to the system, and it includes everything that may affect the system, and may be affected by it at any given time.
Equifinality: In open systems, the principle that the same final state can be reached from different initial conditions, or in different ways.
Evolution: A tendency toward greater structural complexity, ecological and/or organizational simplicity, more efficient modes of operation, greater dynamic harmony, etc. As a cosmic process, it is not limited to the domain of biological phenomena, but extends to include all aspects of change in open dynamic systems with a throughput of information and energy.
Evolutionary systems: A type of system which reproduces with mutation.
