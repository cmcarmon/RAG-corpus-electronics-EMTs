Yee chose this notation because he interleaved his ~EE and ~HH
components in the space lattice at intervals of Dx=2. For
example, the difference of two adjacent ~EE components, sepa-
rated by Dx and located Dx=2 on either side of an ~HH
component, would be used to provide a numerical approxi-
mation for qE=qx to permit stepping the ~HH component in
time. For completeness, it should be added that a numerical
approximation analogous to equation 9.15 for qu=qy or qu=qz
can be written simply by incrementing the j or k subscript of u
by Dy=2 or Dz=2, respectively.
