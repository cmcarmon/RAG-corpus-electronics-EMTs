When the focused spot is centered on track, it is diffracted symmetrically from the two edges of the track,
resulting in a balanced far ﬁeld pattern. As soon as the spot moves away from the center, the symmetry breaks
down and the light distribution in the far ﬁeld tends to shift to one side or the other. A split photodetector
placed in the path of the reﬂected light can therefore sense the relative position of the spot and provide the
appropriate feedback signal. This strategy is depicted schematically in Fig. 80.29; also shown in the ﬁgure are
intensity plots at the detector plane for light reﬂected from various regions of the disk. Note how the intensity
shifts to one side or the other depending on the direction of motion of the spot.
