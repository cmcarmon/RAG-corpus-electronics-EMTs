Just as an amplifier is a device that provides amplification, amplification is the process of providing 
an increase in AMPLITUDE. Amplitude is a term that describes the size of a signal. In terms of a.c., 
amplitude usually refers to the amount of voltage or current. A 5-volt peak-to-peak a.c.signal would be 
larger in amplitude than a 4-volt peak-to-peak a.c. signal. "SIGNAL" is a general term used to refer to any 
a.c. or d.c. of interest in a circuit; e.g., input signal and output signal. A signal can be large or small, ac. or 
d.c., a sine wave or nonsinusoidal, or even nonelectrical such as sound or light. "Signal" is a very general 
term and, therefore, not very descriptive by itself, but it does sound more technical than the word "thing". 
It is not very impressive to refer to the "input thing" or the "thing that comes out of this circuit."
