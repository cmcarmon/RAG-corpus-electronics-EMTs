The  three  types  of  CMOS  are  compared  in  Table  79.8.  The  relative  speeds  of  these  technologies  are  best
illustrated by including in the table the maximum clock frequencies for D ﬂip-ﬂops. In each case, the frequency
given is the maximum for which the device is guaranteed to work. It is worth noting that a typical maximum
clocking of 160 MHz is claimed for the 74ACT374 D ﬂip-ﬂop.
