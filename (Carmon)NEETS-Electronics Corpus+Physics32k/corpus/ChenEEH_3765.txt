To reduce the computational load and to mitigate the nu-
merical problems arising from many products of probabilities,
it is common to sum negative log probabilities rather than to
multiply probabilities directly. If this strategy is used, the
problem reverts to a minimal cost path search because high
probabilities result in small negative logs. The steps of a Viterbi
search algorithm based on this cost strategy are shown in
Figure 3.12. Note that a provision for state backtracking is
included in the algorithm.
