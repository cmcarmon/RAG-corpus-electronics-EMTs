A different approach to supporting the software plug-in
framework was adopted by Haynes et al. (2000). They have
developed a scalable architecture called Sonic, which consists
of multiple modules capable of accommodating different types
and sizes of conÔ¨Ågurable devices, general-purpose processors,
and custom-designed circuits. Such modules have a common
interface and are connected by high-speed control and data
busses. The architecture is particularly effective for video and
