The pair distribution function is used to describe the distribution of objects within a medium (for example, oranges in a crate or nitrogen molecules in a gas cylinder). If the medium is homogeneous (i.e. every spatial location has identical properties), then there is an equal probability density for finding an object at any position

where



V


{\displaystyle V}
is the volume of the container. On the other hand, the likelihood of finding pairs of objects at given positions (i.e. the two-body probability density) is not uniform. For example, pairs of hard balls must be separated by at least the diameter of a ball. The pair distribution function

{\displaystyle g({\vec {r}},{\vec {r}}')}
is obtained by scaling the two-body probability density function by the total number of objects

In the common case where the number of objects in the container is large, this simplifies to give:
