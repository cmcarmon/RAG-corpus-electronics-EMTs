secondary. Transformers are wound with the second-
ary on top of the primary. The magnetic field created 
by the primary current cuts the secondary windings. 
The current in the secondary establishes a magnetic 
field of its own. The expanding magnetic field in the 
secondary cuts the primary turns, inducing a voltage 
back into the primary. This magnetic field expands in 
the same direction as the current in the primary, aid-
ing it and causing it to increase, with an effect called 
mutual	inductance. The primary induces a voltage 
into the secondary, and the secondary induces a volt-
age back into the primary.
