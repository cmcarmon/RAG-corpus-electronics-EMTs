Figure 3-48 shows a trapezoidal wave. The wave consists of a sharp, almost instantaneous jump in 
voltage followed by a linear rise to some peak value. The initial change in voltage at T0 is called a JUMP 
or STEP. The jump is followed by a linear sawtooth voltage rise. The time from the jump to the peak 
amplitude is the sum of the jump voltage and the sawtooth peak; where the peak value occurs is the 
electrical length. The peak voltage amplitude is the sum of the jump voltage and the sawtooth peak 
voltage. The waveshape can be considered a combination of a rectangular wave and a sawtooth wave.
