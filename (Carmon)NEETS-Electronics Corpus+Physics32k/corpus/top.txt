In mathematics, the Łukaszyk–Karmowski metric is a function defining a distance between two random variables or two random vectors. This function is not a metric as it does not satisfy the identity of indiscernibles condition of the metric, that is for two identical arguments its value is greater than zero. The concept is named after Szymon Łukaszyk and Wojciech Karmowski.
