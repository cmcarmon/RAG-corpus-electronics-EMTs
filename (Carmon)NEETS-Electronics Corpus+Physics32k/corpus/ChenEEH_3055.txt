Protecting all the equipment—generators, transformers, trans-
mission lines, and distribution feeders—against short circuits
is essential. The general principle is to detect the fault (the
short circuit) and isolate the equipment. In its simplest form, a
fuse detects the fault by burning out and thus isolating the line.
In its most sophisticated form, microprocessor-based relays
can detect the fault and analyze which circuit breakers need
to be opened to isolate the equipment. Protection system
details are covered in Chapter 9, Power System Protection.
