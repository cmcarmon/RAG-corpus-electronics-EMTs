Adding Hierarchical Data Reuse Copies
When the example transformed code 2.2 is executed on a
processor with a small cache, it will perform much better
than the initial code. To map it on a custom memory hier-
archy, however, we have to know the optimal size of the
different levels of this hierarchy. To this end, signal copies
(buffers) are added to the code to make the data reuse explicit.
For the example, this results in the following code (the initial-
ization of a_bufâ€˜ has been left out for simplicity):
