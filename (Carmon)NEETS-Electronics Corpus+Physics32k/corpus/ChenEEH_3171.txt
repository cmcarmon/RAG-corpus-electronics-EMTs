Because insulators perform both mechanical and electrical
functions, they are identiﬁed by a combined mechanical and
electrical (M and E) rating. The M and E rating is deﬁned as
the mechanical load at which the insulator fails to perform its
function either electrically or mechanically and when voltage
and stress are applied simultaneously. It is normal to design the
insulator such that the daily and the maximum loads experi-
enced by the insulator are 20% and 50% of the M and E rating,
respectively. International standards require that every suspen-
sion insulator unit is routinely test with a 50% (per ANSI) or
60% (per IEC) of the M- and E-rated load for 10 sec.
