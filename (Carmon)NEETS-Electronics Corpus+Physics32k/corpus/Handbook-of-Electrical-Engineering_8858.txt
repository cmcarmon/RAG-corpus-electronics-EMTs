Figure 88.2 depicts a common construction of a memory hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy are the CPU
registers, which are small and extremely fast. The next level down in the hierarchy is a special, high-speed semi-

conductor memory known as a 
most current systems have between one and three levels of cache. Some of the levels of cache may be on the
CPU chip itself, they may be on the same module as the CPU, or they all may be entirely distinct. Below the

is semiconductor memory, but it is slower, cheaper, and denser than a cache. Below the main memory is the
virtual memory, which is generally stored on magnetic or optical disk. Accessing the virtual memory can be
tens of thousands times slower than accessing the main memory because it involves moving mechanical parts.
As requests go deeper into the memory hierarchy, they encounter levels that are larger (in terms of capacity)
and slower than the higher levels (moving left to right in Fig. 88.2). In addition to size and speed, the bandwidth
in-between adjacent levels in the memory hierarchy is smaller for the lower levels. The bandwidth in-between
the registers and top cache level, for example, is higher than that between cache and main memory or main
memory and virtual memory. Since each level presumably intercepts a fraction of the requests, the bandwidth
to the level below need not be as great as that to the intercepting level.
