Other forms of input to the vocal tract include plosive
excitation and whisper. Because there are pauses7 in speech,
we also include silence as a form of ‘‘excitation’’ for modeling
completeness. Plosive sounds are formed by making a com-
plete closure (normally toward the front of the vocal tract),
building air pressure behind the closure, and suddenly re-
leasing it. The word pat begins with the voiced plosive =p=
(silence, then voiced), and ends with the unvoiced plosive =t=
(silence, then unvoiced). The whisper excitation is formed by
forcing air through a partially constricted glottis.
