Problem 3.22: Big is Beautiful
Sammy wants to choose speakers that produce very loud music. He has an ampliﬁer and notices that the
speaker terminals are labeled “8 Ω source.”
(a) What does this mean in terms of the ampliﬁer’s equivalent circuit?
(b) Any speaker Sammy attaches to the terminals can be well-modeled as a resistor. Choosing a speaker
amounts to choosing the values for the resistor. What choice would maximize the voltage across the
speakers?
