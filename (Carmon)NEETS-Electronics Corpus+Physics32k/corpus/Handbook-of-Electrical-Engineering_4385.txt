Fiber Transmission Characteristics
The proper design and operation of an optical communication system using
optical ﬁbers as the transmission medium requires a knowledge of the trans-
mission  characteristics  of  the  optical  sources,  ﬁbers,  and  interconnection
devices  (connectors,  couplers,  and  splices)  used  to  join  lengths  of  ﬁbers
together.  The  transmission  criteria  that  affect  the  choice  of  the  ﬁber  type
used in a system are signal attenuation, information transmission capacity
(bandwidth),  and  source  coupling  and  interconnection  efﬁciency.  Signal
attenuation is due to a number of loss mechanisms within the ﬁber, as shown in Table 42.1, and due to the
losses  occurring  in  splices  and  connectors.  The  information  transmission  capacity  of  a  ﬁber  is  limited  by
dispersion, a phenomenon that causes light that is originally concentrated into a short pulse to spread out into
a broader pulse as it travels along an optical ﬁber. Source and interconnection efﬁciency depends on the ﬁber’s
core  diameter  and  its  numerical  aperture,  a  measure  of  the  angle  over  which  light  is  accepted  in  the  ﬁber.
Absorption  and  scattering  of  light  traveling  through  a  ﬁber  leads  to  signal  attenuation,  the  rate  of  which  is
measured in decibels per kilometer (dB/km). As can be seen in Fig. 42.17, for both multimode and single-mode
ﬁbers, attenuation depends strongly on wavelength. The decrease in scattering losses with increasing wavelength
is offset by an increase in material absorption such that attenuation is lowest near 1.55 mm (1550 nm).
