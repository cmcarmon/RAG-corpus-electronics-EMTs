When the first negative alternation is applied to the circuit (view D), the left-hand plate of Cc must
go negative. To do this, electrons are drawn from the right-hand plate. The electrons travel from the
right-hand plate of Cc, through Rg causing a voltage drop negative (top) to positive (bottom), from the
bottom of Rg, through the source, to the left-hand plate of Cc. Cc will discharge for the duration of the
negative alternation. BUT Cc can only discharge through Rg, which is a high-resistance path,
compared to the charge path. Remember from your study of capacitors that RC time constants and the
rate of discharge increase with the size of R. Cc can therefore charge through the low resistance of rgk to
its maximum negative value during the positive half-cycle. Because Cc discharges through Rg (the high
resistance path), it cannot completely discharge during the duration of the negative half-cycle. As a result,
at the completion of the negative alternation, Cc still retains part of the negative charge it gained during
the positive alternation. When the next positive alternation starts, the right-hand plate of Cc will be more
negative than when the first positive alternation started.
