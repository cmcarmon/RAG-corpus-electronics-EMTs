4.2.9 Three identical impedances of 30(cid:2) 30°  are con-
nected in delta to a three-phase 173-V system by
conductors that have impedances of 0.8+ j0.6 
each. Compute the magnitude of the line-to-line
voltage at the terminals of the load.
4.2.10 Repeat Problem 4.2.9 for a delta-connected set of
capacitors with a per-phase reactance of −j60 
connected in parallel with the load, and compare
the result with that obtained in Problem 4.2.9.
