The oscilloscope 
 
An  oscilloscope  is  an  extremely  comprehensive 
and versatile item of test equipment which can be 
used  in  a  variety  of  measuring  applications,  the 
most  important  of  which  is  the  display  of  time 
related voltage waveforms. 
 The oscilloscope display is provided by a cathode 
ray  tube  (CRT)  that  has  a  typical  screen  area  of  
8 cm × 10 cm. The CRT is fitted with a graticule 
that may either be integral with the tube face or a 
separate translucent sheet. The graticule is usually 
ruled  with a l cm  grid to  which  further bold lines 
may be added to mark the major axes on the central 
viewing 
time 
measurements  may  be  made  with  reference  to  the 
graticule, applying a scale factor derived from the 
appropriate range switch. 
  A word  of  caution  is  appropriate  at  this  stage, 
however.  Before  taking  meaningful  measurements 
from  the  CRT  screen  it  is  absolutely  essential  to 
ensure that the front panel variable controls are set 
in  the  calibrate  (CAL)  position.  Results  will 
almost  certainly  be  inaccurate  if  this  is  not  the 
case! 
  The  use  of  the  graticule  is  illustrated  by  the 
following example: 
  An oscilloscope screen is depicted in Fig. 14.24. 
This diagram is reproduced actual size and the fine 
graticule  markings  are  shown  every  2  mm  along 
the central vertical and horizontal axes. 
  The  oscilloscope  is  operated  with  all  relevant 
controls  in  the  ‘CAL’  position.  The  timebase 
(horizontal deflection) is  switched to the 1  ms/cm 
range  and
