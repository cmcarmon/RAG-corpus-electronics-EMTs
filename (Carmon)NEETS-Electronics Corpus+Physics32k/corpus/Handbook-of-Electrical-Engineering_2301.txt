K is a proportionality constant dependent on diode doping, and Aj is the diode area. Cj is voltage dependent.
As VD increases, Cj increases in a forward-biased diode in Fig. 22.19. For V0 = 0.7 V and VD = â€“10 V and Cj0 =
3 pF, the diode depletion capacitance is Cj = 0.75 pF. In Fig. 22.20 the small-signal model of the diode is shown.
The total small-signal time constant td is thus (by neglecting the bulk series diode resistance RBB)
