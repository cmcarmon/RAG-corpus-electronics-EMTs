Single-Loop Linear Control Laws
Consider the case where a single variable of the process is to be controlled, as illustrated in Fig. 100.38. The
output of the plant y(t) is to be sampled every T seconds by an A/D converter, and this sequence of numbers
will be denoted as y(kT), k = 0, 1, 2, . . . . The goal is to make the sequence y(kT) follow some desired known
sequence [the reference sequence r(kT)]. Consequently, the sequence y(kT) is subtracted from r(kT) to obtain
the so-called error sequence e(kT). The control computer then acts on the error sequence, using some control
algorithms, to produce the control effort sequence u(kT) that is supplied to the digital-to-analog (D/A) converter
which then drives the actuating hardware with a signal proportional to u(kT). The output of the D/A converter
is then held constant on the current time interval, and the control computer waits for the next sample of the
variable  to  be  controlled,  the  arrival  of  which  repeats  the  sequence.  The  most  commonly  employed  control
algorithm or control law is a linear difference equation of the form
