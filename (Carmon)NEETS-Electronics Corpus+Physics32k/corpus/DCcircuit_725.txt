â€¢ Shunt resistors can be used in conjunction with high-resistance voltmeters as well as
low-resistance ammeter movements, producing accurate voltage drops for given amounts
of current. Shunt resistors should be selected for as low a resistance value as possible to
minimize their impact upon the circuit under test.
