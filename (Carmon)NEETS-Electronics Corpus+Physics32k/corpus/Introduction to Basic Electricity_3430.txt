The most obvious advantage of the integrated  circuit 
is its small size. An integrated circuit is  constructed of 
a chip of semiconductor material  approximately one-
eighth of an inch square. It is because of the integrated 
circuitâ€™s small size that it finds extensive use in military 
and aerospace programs. The integrated circuit has 
also transformed the calculator from a desktop instru-
ment to a handheld instrument. Computer systems, 
once the size of rooms, are now available in portable 
models because of integrated circuits.
