If you look at the carry‐bit column in the truth table for the half adder, you 
may notice that it looks just like the output for the two‐input AND gate shown 
in Figure 11-3: That is, the carry bit is the same as A AND B, where A and B are 
the two input bits. Similarly, the sum bit is the same as A XOR B. What’s the 
significance of this? You can build a half adder using an AND gate and an XOR 
gate. You feed the input bits into both gates, and use the AND gate to gener-
ate the carry bit and the XOR gate to generate the sum bit. (See Figure 11-5.)
