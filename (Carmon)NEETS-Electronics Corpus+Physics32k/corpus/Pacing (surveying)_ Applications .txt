Common uses of pacing consist of measuring tree height or measuring the distance between plots. Pacing saves time but is not as accurate as using a tape measure and can be affected by terrain such as steep slopes, rocky areas, streams, and thick brush. A common practice in pacing when an obstacle is encountered is to offset or pace around the obstacle.
However, sometimes pacing around an obstacle is not always an option. Good pacing can only be accomplished by practice. Knowing the distance of one's pace will help to ensure accuracy and precision of pacing distances.
