Look at figure 1-11. In this circuit, as in other parallel circuits, the voltage is the same across the 
inductor and capacitor. The currents through the components vary inversely with their reactances in 
accordance with Ohm's law. The total current drawn by the circuit is the vector sum of the two individual 
component currents. Finally, these two currents, IL and IC, are 180 degrees out of phase because the 
effects of L and C are opposite. There is not a single fact new to you in the above. It is all based on what 
you have learned previously about parallel a.c. circuits that contain L and C.
