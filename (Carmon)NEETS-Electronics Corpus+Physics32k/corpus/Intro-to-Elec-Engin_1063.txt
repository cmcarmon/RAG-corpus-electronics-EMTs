12.2.5 A wye-connected, three-phase, 50-Hz, six-pole
synchronous alternator develops a voltage of
1000 V rms between the lines when the rotor dc
ﬁeld current is 3 A. If this alternator is to generate
60-Hz voltages, ﬁnd the new synchronous speed,
and calculate the new terminal voltage for the
same ﬁeld current.
