When the XC of a filter capacitor is decreased, it provides less opposition to the flow of ac. The 
greater the ac flow through the capacitor, the lower the flow through the load. Conversely, the larger the 
XL of the choke, the greater the amount of ac ripple developed across the choke; consequently, less ripple 
is developed across the load and better filtering is obtained.
