The formula for an escape velocity is easily derived as follows. The specific energy (energy per unit mass) of any space vehicle is composed of two components, the specific potential energy and the specific kinetic energy. The specific potential energy associated with a planet of mass M is given by





ϵ

p

G
M

r





{\displaystyle \epsilon _{p}=-{\frac {GM}{r}}\,}

while the specific kinetic energy of an object is given by

k

v

{\displaystyle \epsilon _{k}={\frac {v^{2}}{2}}\,}

Since energy is conserved,

{\displaystyle \epsilon =\epsilon _{k}+\epsilon _{p},\!}

and so the total specific orbital energy

does not depend on the distance,

The escape velocity from the Earth's surface is about 11 km/s, but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the Sun. To escape the Solar System from a location at a distance from the Sun equal to the distance Sun–Earth, but not close to the Earth, requires around 42 km/s velocity, but there will be "part credit" for the Earth's orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from Earth, if their further acceleration (due to the propulsion system) carries them in the same direction as Earth travels in its orbit.
