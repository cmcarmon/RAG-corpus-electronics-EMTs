In this section the variety and diversity of signal processing is presented from a theoretical point of view,
from an implementation point of view, and from an applications point of view. The theoretical point of view
includes the development of mathematical models and the development of software algorithms and computer
simulations to evaluate and analyze the models both with simulated data and with real data. High-level software
tools are important in both the development of new theoretical results and in establishing the validity of the
results when applied to real data. The applications determine the way in which the theory is implemented; a
key element in the implementation of a signal processing technique relates to whether the technique is applied
in real-time (or close to real-time) or whether the processing can be handled off-line. Real-time implementation
can use VLSI (very large scale integration) techniques, with commercial DSP chips, or it can involve custom
design of chips, MCMs (multichip modules), or ASICs (application-speciÔ¨Åc integrated circuits). The selection
of topics in this section covers the three points of view (theoretical, application, implementation) but should
not be assumed to include a complete summary of these topics.
