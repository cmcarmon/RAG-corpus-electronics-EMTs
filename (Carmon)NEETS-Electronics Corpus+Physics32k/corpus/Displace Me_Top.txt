Displace Me was a nationwide event hosted by the nonprofit Invisible Children Inc. on April 28, 2007. In 15 cities across the United States, 68,000 individuals came together to raise awareness about the situation of the displacement camps in northern Uganda.
The event had three main goals:
To educate participants about displacement camps in the North by simulating, as best as possible, the experience of living in an IDP camp.
To create greater national and international attention of the humanitarian crises in northern Uganda.
To garner the political attention needed to see a peaceful resolution to the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, primarily through the appointment of one senior level U.S. diplomat.
