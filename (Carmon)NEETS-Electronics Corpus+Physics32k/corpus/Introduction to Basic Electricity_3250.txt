Voltage source EDS is connected so that the source 
is made negative with respect to the drain. This causes 
a current to flow, because the majority carriers are 
 electrons in the N-type material. The source-to-drain 
current is called the FET’s drain current (ID). The 
channel serves as resistance to the supply voltage (EDS).
The gate-to-source	voltage	(EGS) is connected 
so that the gate is negative with respect to the source. 
This causes the P–N junction formed by the gate and 
channel to be reverse biased. This creates a deple-
tion region in the vicinity of the P–N junction, which 
spreads inward along the length of the channel. The 
depletion region is wider at the drain end because the 
EDS voltage adds to the EGS voltage, creating a higher-
reverse bias voltage than that appearing across the 
source end.
