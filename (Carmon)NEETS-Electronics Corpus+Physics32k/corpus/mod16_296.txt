When troubleshooting, testing, or repairing electronic equipment, you will use various meters and
other types of test equipment to check for proper circuit voltages, currents, resistances, and to determine if
the wiring is defective. You may be able to connect these test instruments to a circuit and take readings
without knowing just how the instruments operate. However, to be a competent technician, you need to be
able to do more than merely read a test instrument. You need a basic knowledge of how test instruments
operate. This chapter discusses the operating principles of some of the test instruments you will use in
equipment troubleshooting.
