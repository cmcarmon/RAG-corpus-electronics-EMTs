As noted above, the requirement that the action integral be stationary under small perturbations of the evolution is equivalent to a set of differential equations (called the Euler–Lagrange equations) that may be determined using the calculus of variations. We illustrate this derivation here using only one coordinate, x; the extension to multiple coordinates is straightforward.
Adopting Hamilton's principle, we assume that the Lagrangian L (the integrand of the action integral) depends only on the coordinate x(t) and its time derivative dx(t)/dt, and may also depend explicitly on time. In that case, the action integral can be written as






S

∫

)

d

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}L(x,{\dot {x}},t)\,dt,}

where the initial and final times (t1 and t2) and the final and initial positions are specified in advance as




x

1


=
x
(

t

1


)


{\displaystyle x_{1}=x(t_{1})}
and




x

2


=
x
(

t

2


)


{\displaystyle x_{2}=x(t_{2})}
. Let xtrue(t) represent the true evolution that we seek, and let




x

per


(
t
)


{\displaystyle x_{\text{per}}(t)}
be a slightly perturbed version of it, albeit with the same endpoints,




x

per


(

t

1


)
=

x

1




{\displaystyle x_{\text{per}}(t_{1})=x_{1}}
and




x

per


(

t

2


)
=

x

2




{\displaystyle x_{\text{per}}(t_{2})=x_{2}}
. The difference between these two evolutions, which we will call



ε
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \varepsilon (t)}
, is infinitesimally small at all times:




ε
(
t
)
=

x

per


(
t
)
−

x

true


(
t
)
.


{\displaystyle \varepsilon (t)=x_{\text{per}}(t)-x_{\text{true}}(t).}

At the endpoints, the difference vanishes, i.e.,



ε
(

t

1


)
=
ε
(

t

2


)
=
0


{\displaystyle \varepsilon (t_{1})=\varepsilon (t_{2})=0}
.
Expanded to first order, the difference between the actions integrals for the two evolutions is

{\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {S}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\left(\varepsilon {\frac {\partial L}{\partial x}}-\varepsilon {\frac {d}{dt}}{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {x}}}}.\right)\,dt.}

The requirement that





S




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}}
be stationary implies that the first-order change must be zero for any possible perturbation ε(t) about the true evolution:

This can be true only if

The Euler–Lagrange equation is obeyed provided the functional derivative of the action integral is identically zero:

The quantity






∂
L

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {x}}}}}
is called the conjugate momentum for the coordinate x. An important consequence of the Euler–Lagrange equations is that if L does not explicitly contain coordinate x, i.e.
if






∂
L

=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial L}{\partial x}}=0}
, then






∂

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {x}}}}}

In such cases, the coordinate x is called a cyclic coordinate, and its conjugate momentum is conserved.
