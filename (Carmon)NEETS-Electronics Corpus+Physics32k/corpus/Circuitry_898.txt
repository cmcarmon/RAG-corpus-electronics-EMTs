A typical  mounting  arrangement  for  a  TO220 
semiconductor  package  is  shown  in  Fig.  19.38.  In 
many  cases,  the  tab  of  the  device  is  connected  to 
one of three terminals (often the collector or drain) 
in  which  case  a  mica  or  thermally  conductive 
plastic  washer  must  be  fitted.  Note  also  that  an 
insulated bush must be used in order to prevent the 
mounting  bolt  shorting  the  metal  tab  to  the 
heatsink.  Figure  19.39  shows  a  similar  mounting 
arrangement  used  for  a  TO218  packaged  device 
while Fig. 19.40 shows how a TO3 device is fitted. 
  The thermal resistance of the mounting kit used 
with  a  semiconductor  device  can  have  a  major 
effect on the efficiency of the heat conduction from 
the surface of the case to the heat radiator. Special 
thermally  impregnated  washers  have  significantly 
lower thermal resistance than simple mica washers. 
Thermally conductive  silicone grease  should NOT 
be used with this type of washer.
