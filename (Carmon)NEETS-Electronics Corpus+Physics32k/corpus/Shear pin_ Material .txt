A shear pin could potentially be made from any material although metal is the most common.
When making a metal object for a mechanical application, an alloy and tempering is usually selected to make the construction resistant to damage. This can for example be achieved by giving the material a high degree of elasticity so that, like a spring, the metal returns to its original shape after being deformed by an external force. A shear pin however is often tempered to make the metal brittle, so that it breaks or shatters rather than bends when the required force is applied.
The material of a shear pin is selected and treated so that it is relatively resistant to fatigue (material). That is, when subjected to small forces, each one insufficient to break the pin, the pin does not retain damage. If material fatigue were to weaken a shear pin, the pin could potentially be broken by a force smaller than the original threshold force causing the mechanism to operate unintentionally, or a safety shear pin to break during normal operation of the machinery it protects.
