Shifting the brushes to the advanced position (the new neutral plane) does not completely solve the 
problems of armature reaction. The effect of armature reaction varies with the load current. Therefore, 
each time the load current varies, the neutral plane shifts. This means the brush position must be changed 
each time the load current varies.
