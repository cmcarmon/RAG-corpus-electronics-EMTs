Preinsulated permanent copper splices are used to join small copper wire AWG sizes No. 26 through 
No. 10. A typical splice is shown in figure 2-23. Note that the splice preinsulation extends over the wire 
insulation. Each splice size can be used for more than one wire size. Splices are color coded in the same 
manner as preinsulated small copper terminal lugs (see table 2-2).
