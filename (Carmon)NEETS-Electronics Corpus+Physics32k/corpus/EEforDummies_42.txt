Electrical systems use electric current to power things such as light bulbs 
and kitchen appliances. Electronic systems take this a step further: They 
control the current, switching it on and off, changing its fluctuations, direc-
tion, and timing in various ways to accomplish a variety of functions, from 
dimming a light bulb (see Figure 1-1), to flashing your holiday light display 
in sync with your favorite holiday tune, to communicating via satellites â€” 
and lots of other things. This control distinguishes electronic systems from 
 electrical systems.
