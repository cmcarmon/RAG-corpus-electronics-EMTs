The input capacitor (C1) has the greatest pulsating voltage applied to it and is the most susceptible to 
voltage surges. As a result, the input capacitor is frequently subject to voltage breakdown and shorting. 
The remaining shunt capacitor (C2) in the filter circuit is not subject to voltage surges because of the 
protection offered by the series filter resistor (R1). However, a shunt capacitor can become open, leaky, or 
shorted.
