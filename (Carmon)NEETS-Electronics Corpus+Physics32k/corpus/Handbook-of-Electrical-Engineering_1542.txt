and equivalence classiﬁcation techniques. An extensive empirical study of these techniques for language mod-
eling  is  given  in  [35].  A  brief  description  of  two  smoothing  techniques  is  covered  in  this  section.  Linear

are presented. The maximum-likelihood estimate is interpolated with the smoothed lower-order distribution
deﬁned analogously, i.e.
