Biomedical  sensors  can  be  classiÔ¨Åed  according  to  how  they  are  used  with  respect  to  the  biologic  system.
Table 114.1 shows that sensors can range from noninvasive to invasive as far as the biologic host is concerned.
The most noninvasive of biomedical sensors do not even contact the biological system being measured. Sensors
Noninvasive
of radiant heat or sound energy coming from an organism are examples of noncontacting sensors. 
sensors 
can also be placed on the body surface. Skin surface thermometers, biopotential electrodes, and strain
gauges placed on the skin are examples of noninvasive sensors. Indwelling sensors are those which can be placed
into a natural body cavity that communicates with the outside. These are sometimes referred to as minimally
invasive sensors and include such familiar sensors as oral-rectal thermometers, intrauterine pressure transduc-
ers, and stomach pH sensors. The most invasive sensors are those that need to be surgically placed and that
