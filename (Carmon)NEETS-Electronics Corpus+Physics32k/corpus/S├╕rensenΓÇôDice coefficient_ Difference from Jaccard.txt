This coefficient is not very different in form from the Jaccard index. In fact, both are equivalent in the sense that given a value for the Sørensen–Dice coefficient

Since the Sørensen–Dice coefficient doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality, it can be considered a semimetric version of the Jaccard index.
The function ranges between zero and one, like Jaccard. Unlike Jaccard, the corresponding difference function

is not a proper distance metric as it does not possess the property of triangle inequality. The simplest counterexample of this is given by the three sets {a}, {b}, and {a,b}, the distance between the first two being 1, and the difference between the third and each of the others being one-third. To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of any two of these three sides must be greater than or equal to the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1.
