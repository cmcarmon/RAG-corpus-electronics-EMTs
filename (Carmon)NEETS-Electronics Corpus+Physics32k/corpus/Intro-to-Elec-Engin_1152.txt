The viewpoint adopted in explaining the operation of the single-phase motor, based on
the conditions already established for polyphase motors, is known as the revolving-ﬁeld theory.
(The other viewpoint, cross-ﬁeld theory, is not presented here.) For computational purposes, the
revolving-ﬁeld point of view, already introduced in Section 13.1, is followed hereafter to parallel
the analysis we applied to the polyphase induction motor. As stated in Section 13.1 and shown
in Section 12.3, a stationary pulsating ﬁeld can be represented by two counterrotating ﬁelds of
constant magnitude. The equivalent circuit of a single-phase induction motor, then, consists of
the series connection of a forward rotating ﬁeld equivalent circuit and a backward rotating one.
Each circuit is similar to that of a three-phase machine, but in the backward rotating ﬁeld circuit,
the parameter S is replaced by 2 − S, as shown in Figure 13.2.11(a). The forward and backward
torques are calculated from the two parts of the equivalent circuit, and the total torque is given by
the albegraic sum of the two. As shown in Figure 13.2.11(b), the torque–speed characteristic of
a single-phase induction motor is thus obtained as the sum of the two curves, one corresponding
to the forward rotating ﬁeld and the other to the backward rotating ﬁeld.
