Based on the general spectral model, a predictive coder formulates an estimate of a future sample of speech
based  on  a  weighted  combination  of  the  immediately  preceding  samples.  The  error  in  this  estimate  (the
prediction  residual
)  typically  comprises  a  signiﬁcant  portion  of  the  data  stream  of  the  encoded  speech.  The
residual contains information that is important in speech perception and cannot be modeled in a straightfor-
ward fashion. The most familiar form of predictive coder is the classical Differential Pulse Code Modulation
