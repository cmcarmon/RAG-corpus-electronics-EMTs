The preceding discussion suggests an interesting interpretation of Q. From
Equations 12.63 and 12.64 we see that the period of oscillation of the circuit
states is 2π/ωd. Thus, the period of Q oscillations is 2πQ/ωd. In the latter
period of time the same equations show that the amplitude of the circuit states
will decay by
