Despite lock-out/tag-out procedures and multiple repetitions of electrical safety rules in indus-
try, accidents still do occur. The vast majority of the time, these accidents are the result of not
following proper safety procedures. But however they may occur, they still do happen, and any-
one working around electrical systems should be aware of what needs to be done for a victim
of electrical shock.
