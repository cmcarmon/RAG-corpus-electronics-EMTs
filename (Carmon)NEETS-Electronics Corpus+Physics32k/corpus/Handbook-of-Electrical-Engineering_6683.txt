 which are analogous to the formal parameters of a procedure
in  a  programming  language.  For  example,  the  parameters  for  the  DL_CONNECT.request  primitive  are  the
Called Address, the Calling Address, and the Quality of Service Parameter Set. The four primitives are used in
the  establishment  of  data  link  connections.  The  called  address  and  the  calling  address  are  analogous  to  the
telephone numbers of two parties of a telephone call, while the quality of service parameter set allows for the
negotiation of various agreements such as throughput measured in bits per second.
