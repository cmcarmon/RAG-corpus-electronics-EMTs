Transducers that produce digital outputs may be ﬁrst connected to Schmitt trigger circuits for pulse shaping
purposes,  and  this  can  be  considered  as  a  form  of  digital  signal  conditioning.  This  becomes  an  essential
requirement  when  such  inputs  are  connected  through  long  transmission  lines  where  the  line  capacitance
signiﬁcantly  affects  the  rising  and  falling  edges  of  the  incoming  wave.  Opto-isolators  are  sometimes  used  in
coupling when the voltage levels of the two sides of the transducer and the input circuit of the data acquisition
unit  do  not  match  each  other.  Special  kinds  of  connectors  are  designed  and  widely  used  in  interconnecting
