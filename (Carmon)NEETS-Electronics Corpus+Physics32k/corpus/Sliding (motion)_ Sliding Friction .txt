Sliding friction (also called kinetic friction) is a contact force that resists the sliding motion of two objects or an object and a surface. Sliding friction is almost always less than that of static friction; this is why it is easier to move an object once it starts moving rather than to get the object to begin moving from a rest position.

Where Fk, is the force of kinetic friction. μk is the coefficient of kinetic friction, and N is the normal force.
