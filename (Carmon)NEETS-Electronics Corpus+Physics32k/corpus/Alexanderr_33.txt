Dependent sources are usually designated by diamond-shaped symbols,
as  shown  in  Fig.  1.13.  Since  the  control  of  the  dependent  source  is
achieved by a voltage or current of some other element in the circuit,
and the source can be voltage or current, it follows that there are four
possible types of dependent sources, namely:
