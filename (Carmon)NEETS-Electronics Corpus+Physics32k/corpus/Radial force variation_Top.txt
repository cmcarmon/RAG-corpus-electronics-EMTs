Radial force variation or road force variation (RFV) is a property of a tire that affects steering, traction, braking and load support. High values of RFV for a given tire reflect a high level of manufacturing variations in the tire structure that will impart ride disturbances into the vehicle in the vertical direction. RFV is measured according to processes specified by the ASTM International in ASTM F1806 â€“ Standard Practice for Tire Testing.
