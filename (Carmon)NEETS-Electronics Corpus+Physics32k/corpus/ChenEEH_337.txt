The variable M is the implant dose. This equation assumes that
the threshold adjust implant is very shallow and behaves as a
sheet of Ô¨Åxed charge located under the gate oxide. In some
cases, additional doped layers are placed in the channel to
suppress punchthrough, a term that will be discussed later.
