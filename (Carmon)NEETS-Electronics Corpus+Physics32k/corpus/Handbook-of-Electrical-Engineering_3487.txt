External Resistance
To precisely determine the resistance to thermal transport from a surface to a ﬂuid in motion, i.e., the convective
resistance, it is necessary to quantify the heat transfer coefﬁcient, h. For a particular geometry and ﬂow regime,
h may be found from available empirical correlations and/or theoretical relations. For ﬂow along plates and in
the inlet zones of parallel-plate channels, as may well be encountered in electronic cooling applications, the low
velocity, or laminar ﬂow, average convective heat transfer coefﬁcient is given by [Kraus and Bar-Cohen, 1983]
