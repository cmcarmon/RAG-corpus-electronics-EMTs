Lever release is a hybrid repeating action, that uses the physical manipulation of a lever to chamber cartridges (similar to lever-action firearms). However, unlike lever action, lever release firearms eject the cartridge independently of the lever, usually via blowback or gas operation.
Whilst the basic principle can be traced back to other self-ejecting rifles, such as the single shot Harrington & Richardson Model 755 rifle, the action has since been popularised in the UK by Southern Gun Company, who manufacture such rifles in a range of calibres, as the interrupted mechanism complies with The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 which bans possession of self-loading centrefire rifles.
