The Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient G  accounts for the electrical properties of the earth’s surface. Because the
earth is a lossy medium, the value of the reﬂection coefﬁcient depends on the complex relative permittivity e
of the surface, the grazing angle y,  and the wave polarization. It is given by
