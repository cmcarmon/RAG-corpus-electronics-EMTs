Any combination of resistor values adding up to 75 ohms could be placed in series to develop the
required network. For example, if you had two 37.5-ohm resistors, you could connect them in series to get
a network of 75 ohms. One 50-ohm and one 25-ohm resistor or seven 10-ohm and one 5-ohm resistor
could also be used.
