Fiber Coating System. The glass ﬁber coming out of the furnace has a highly polished pristine surface and
the theoretical strength of such a ﬁber is in the range of 15–20 GPa. Strengths in the range of 4.5–5.5 GPa are
routinely  measured  on  short  ﬁber  lengths.  To  preserve  this  high  strength,  polymeric  coatings  are  applied
immediately after the drawing. The coating must be applied without damaging the ﬁber, it must solidify before
reaching the capstan, and it should not cause microbending loss. To satisfy all these requirements, usually two
layers of coatings are applied: a soft inner coating adjacent to the ﬁber to avoid microbending loss and a hard
outer  coating  to  resist  abrasion.  The  coatings  are  a  combination  of  ultraviolet-  (UV)  curable  acrylates,  UV-
curable silicones, hot melts, heat-curable silicones, and nylons. When dual coatings are applied, the coated ﬁber
diameter is typically 235–250 mm. The nylon-jacketed ﬁber typically used in Japan has an outside diameter of
900 mm. All coating materials are usually ﬁltered to remove particles that may damage the ﬁber. Coatings are
usually applied by passing the ﬁber through a coating cup and then curing the coating before the ﬁber is taken
up by the capstan. The method of application, the coating material, the temperature, and the draw speed affect
the proper application or a well-centered, bubble-free coating.
