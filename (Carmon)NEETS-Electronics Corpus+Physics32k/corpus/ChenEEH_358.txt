The junction ﬁeld effect transistor (JFET) was ﬁrst proposed
by William Shockley in 1952. The ﬁrst demonstration was
made the following year by Dacey and Ross. Due to the large
popularity of the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) at the time,
major advancements in JFET fabrication did not occur until
the 1970s. With the introduction of MOSFET, the use of JFET
remained limited to speciﬁc applications.
