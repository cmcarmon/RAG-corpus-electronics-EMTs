that is,
the voltage measured across the terminals of a resistor is linearly
proportional to the current flowing through the resistor. The constant of pro-
portionality is called the resistance. As we show shortly, the resistance of a
piece of material is proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its
cross-sectional area.
In our example of Figure 1.4b, suppose that the battery is rated at 1.5 V.
Further assume that the resistance of the bulb is R = 10 . Assume that the
internal resistance of the battery is zero. Then, a current of i = v/R = 150 mA
will flow through the bulb.
