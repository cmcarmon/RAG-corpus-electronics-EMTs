The  power  p in  Eq.  (1.7)  is  a  time-varying  quantity  and  is  called  the
instantaneous power. Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an ele-
ment  is  the  product  of  the  voltage  across  the  element  and  the  current
through  it.  If  the  power  has  a 
sign,  power  is  being  delivered  to  or
absorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, the power has a 
sign,
power  is  being  supplied  by  the  element.  But  how  do  we  know  when
the power has a negative or a positive sign?
