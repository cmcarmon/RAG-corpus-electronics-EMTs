The silver-zinc cell is used extensively to power emergency equipment. This type of cell is relatively 
expensive and can be charged and discharged fewer times than other types of cells. When compared to the 
lead-acid or nickel-cadmium cells, these disadvantages are overweighed by the light weight, small size, 
and good electrical capacity of the silver-zinc cell.
