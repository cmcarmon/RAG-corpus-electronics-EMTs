Close or direct contact with rf transmission lines or antennas may result in rf burns. These are 
usually deep, penetrating, third-degree burns. To heal properly, these burns must heal from the inside to 
the skin's surface. To prevent infection, you must give proper attention to all rf burns, including the small 
"pinhole" burns. Petrolatum gauze can be used to cover these burns temporarily, before the injured person 
reports to medical facilities for further treatment.
