We shall assume that the transmitting and receiving antennas (reciprocal elements) point directly
toward each other, so that their gains are maximum. Letting Lch denote any losses incurred by the
wave in the channel (medium), and Are be the effective area of the receiving antenna, the power
that the receiving antenna is able to produce is given by
