The Simpsons episode "Dark Knight Court" (RABF10) has Mr. Burns asking Comic Book Guy how much he wants for his entire comic book inventory. He says "the speed of light expressed as dollars" and Mr. Burns tells Smithers to "just give him Faraday's Constant". The check is written for $96,485.34.
The Lost episode "The Constant" featured the character Daniel Faraday, and a concept introduced in the episode was finding an anchor to allow time travelers to stay oriented. This anchor was termed a "constant," and the episode prominently featured Daniel Faraday's constant.
