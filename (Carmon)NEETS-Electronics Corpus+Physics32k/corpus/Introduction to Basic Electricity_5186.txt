easy to understand. The two types of drawings are the 
pictorial diagram (Figure 49-16) and the functional 
diagram (Figure 49-17). There is no standard color 
code for wiring a printed circuit board. It is best to use 
different color wires for each discrete component 
and note the colors on the wiring diagram. Discrete 
components are components that are not mounted on 
the PCB. There typically arenâ€™t enough colors for each 
signal to have its own color, but different colors can be 
used to denote different classes of signals.
