The diplexer (Menzel et al., 1997) is a special case of a
multiplexer. Its purpose is to separate two channels, the receiv-
ing channel and the transmit channel by means of two band-
pass ﬁlters whose paths are terminated on the same antenna.
The diplexer is a low-loss alternative to a circulator-based
solution. In the design of the band-pass ﬁlters, the slope-
selectivity between both ﬁlters must be sufﬁcient to ensure a
certain level of isolation between the transmit and the receiv-
ing paths. This isolation is necessary to protect the input of the
receiver from the output power of the transmitter. The iso-
lation bandwidth between the transmitting and the receiving
bandwidths is known as guard band. Figure 7.41 illustrates two
possible diplexer arrangements based on waveguide and planar
circuit technology, respectively.
