There are three primary mutant alleles of dbt: dbtS, which shortens the organism's free-running period (its internal period in constant light conditions); dbtL, which lengthens the free-running period; and dbtP, which causes pupal lethality and eliminates circadian cycling proteins and per and tim transcription. All mutants except for dbtS produce differential PER degradation that directly correspond with their phenotypic behavior. DbtS PER degradation resembles wild-type DBT, which suggests that dbtS does not affect the clock through this degradation mechanism. It has been suggested that dbtS works by acting as a repressor or producing a different phosphoylation pattern of the substrate. DbtS causes early termination of per transcription.
The dbtL mutation causes the period of PER and TIM oscillations, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm is caused by a decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The dbtS mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it is caused by a substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47→ Ser mutation).
Another dbt mutation is dbtAR, which causes arrhythmic activities in Drosophila. It a hypermorphic allele that is the result of a His 126→Tyr mutation. Homozygous flies with this mutation are viable but arrhythmic, whereas dbtAR/+ heterozygotes have extra-long periods of about 29 hours, and their DBT kinase activity is reduced to the lowest rate of all of the DBT alleles.
