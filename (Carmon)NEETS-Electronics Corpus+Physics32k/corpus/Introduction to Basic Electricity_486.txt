■● Bullying: Bullying occurs in the workplace when 
the employer or employees abuse any employee, 
knowing that the individual will be afraid to stand 
up to them, and refuse to take responsibility that 
they are the source of the problem. This type of 
behavior is  considered harassment and is not 
tolerated.
