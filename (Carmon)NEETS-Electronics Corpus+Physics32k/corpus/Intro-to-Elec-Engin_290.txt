Two-Port Network Parameters
A pair of terminals at which a signal may enter or leave a network is called a port, and a network
having two such pairs of terminals, labeled generally input and output terminals, is known as a two-
port network. A two-port network forms a very important building block in electronic systems,
communication systems, automatic control systems, transmission and distribution systems, or in
other systems in which an electric signal or electric energy enters the input terminals, is acted
upon by the network, and leaves via the output terminals.
