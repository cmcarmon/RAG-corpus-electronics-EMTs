The ideal series-resonant circuit has zero impedance. The impedance increases for frequencies higher 
and lower than the resonant frequency. The impedance characteristic of the ideal series-resonant circuit 
results because resultant reactance is zero ohms at resonance and ONLY at resonance. All other 
frequencies provide a resultant reactance greater than zero.
