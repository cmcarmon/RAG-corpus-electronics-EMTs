To show the effect of precession, we can push down on the gimbal ring at point A at the nearer end 
of the Z-Z axis. (See view A of figure 3-7.) You might expect the ring to tilt around the Y-Y axis. Instead, 
the gyro case will tilt about the Z-Z axis. You can see the effect of this precession in view B.
