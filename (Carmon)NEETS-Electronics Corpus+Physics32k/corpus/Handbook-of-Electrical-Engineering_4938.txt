resistance, even though the material is still superconducting. To ﬁx this problem, type II superconductors are
usually fabricated with intentional defects, such as impurities or grain boundaries, in their crystalline structure
to pin the vortices and prevent vortex motion. The pinning is created because the defect locally weakens the
superconductivity  in  the  material,  and  it  is  thus  energetically  favorable  for  the  normal  core  of  the  vortex  to
overlap the nonsuperconducting region in the material. Critical current densities usually quoted for practical
type II materials, therefore, really represent the depinning critical current density where the Lorentz-like force
can  overcome  the  pinning  force.  (The  depinning  critical  current  density  should  not  be  confused  with  the
depairing  critical  current  density,  which  represents  the  current  when  the  Cooper  pairs  have  enough  kinetic
energy to overcome their correlation. The depinning critical current density is typically an order of magnitude
less than the depairing critical current density, the latter of which represents the theoretical maximum for J c.)
By careful manufacturing, it is possible to make superconducting wire with tremendous amounts of current-
carrying  capacity.  For  example,  standard  copper  wire  used  in  homes  will  carry  about  107  A/m2,  whereas  a
practical type II superconductor like niobium–titanium can carry current densities of 1010 A/m2 or higher even
in ﬁelds of several teslas. This property, more than a zero dc resistance, is what makes superconducting wire
so desirable.
