In magnetized plasmas, electrons will gyrate around magnetic field lines and emit Cyclotron radiation. The frequency of the emission is given by the Cyclotron resonance condition. In a sufficiently thick and dense plasma, the intensity of the emission will follow Planck's law, and only depend on the electron temperature.
