In the other Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series (NEETS) modules, you learn the basic
concepts used in electrical systems. Electrical systems include telephone, radio, cable television (CATV),
radar, and satellite links. In the past 30 years, researchers have developed a new technology that offers
greater data rates over longer distances at costs lower than copper wire systems. This new technology is
fiber optics.
