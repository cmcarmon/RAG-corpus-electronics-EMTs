{\displaystyle \Phi _{G}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ U-TS-\mu N}

where U is the internal energy, T is the temperature of the system, S is the entropy, μ is the chemical potential, and N is the number of particles in the system.
The change in the grand potential is given by

When the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium, ΦG is a minimum. This can be seen by considering that dΦG is zero if the volume is fixed and the temperature and chemical potential have stopped evolving.
