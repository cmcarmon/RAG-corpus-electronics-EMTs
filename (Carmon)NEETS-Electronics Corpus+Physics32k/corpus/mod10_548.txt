Whenever the termination is not equal to Z0, reflections occur on the line. For example, if the
terminating element contains resistance, it absorbs some energy, but if the resistive element does not
equal the Z0 of the line, some of the energy is reflected. The amount of voltage reflected may be found by
using the equation:
