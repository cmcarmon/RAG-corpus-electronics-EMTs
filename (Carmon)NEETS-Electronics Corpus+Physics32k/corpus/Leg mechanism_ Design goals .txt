vertical speed as constant as possible while touching the ground (support phase)
while the foot is not touching the ground, it should move as fast as possible
constant torque/force input (or at least no extreme spikes/changes)
stride height (enough for clearance, not too much to conserve energy)
the foot has to touch the ground for at least half of the cycle for a two/four leg mechanism or respectively, a third of the cycle for a three/six leg mechanism
minimized moving mass
vertical center of mass always inside the base of support
the speed of each leg or group of legs should be separately controllable for steering
the leg mechanism should allow forward and backward walking
Another design goal can be, that stride height and length etc. can be controlled by the operator. This can relatively easily be achieved with a hydraulic leg mechanism, but is not practicable with a crank-based leg mechanism.
The optimization has to be done for the whole vehicle â€“ ideally the force/torque variation during a rotation should cancel each other out.
