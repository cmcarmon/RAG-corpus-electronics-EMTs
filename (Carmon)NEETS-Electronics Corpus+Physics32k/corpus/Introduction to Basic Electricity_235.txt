On	the	other	hand,	a	schematic	diagram,	also	called	simply	as	a	circuit	diagram,	is
a	descriptive	outline	of	a	circuitâ€™s	system;	it	is	the	standard	and	less	costly	way	of
circuit	representation.	It	is	like	a	PCB	layout	that	shows	both	of	the	active	and
passive	components	in	a	circuit;	unlike	a	PCB	layout,	however,	its	presentations
can	be	easily	understood.
