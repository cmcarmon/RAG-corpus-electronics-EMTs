Ferrite materials are generally categorized as garnets, spinels,
and hexagonal ferrites. The latter are composed of iron oxides
(a kind of ceramics) and many other elements. The magnetic
anisotropy of a ferrite is controlled by applying an external
static (dc) magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld aligns the inherent mag-
netic dipoles in the material to produce a net (nonzero) mag-
netic dipole moment, which causes the magnetic dipoles to
precess at a frequency controlled by the strength of the bias
ﬁeld. The ideally lossless macroscopic description of the aniso-
tropic properties of ferrites can be described by a Hermitian
permeability tensor as follows:
