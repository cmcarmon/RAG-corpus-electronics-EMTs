The Nevian faster-than-light drive apparently had no noticeable physiological effects even to an observer as well-trained as Conway Costigan. An alternative explanation is possible, however. There is no mention of the neutralization of inertia until the third installment; the physics in the first two installments seems consistent with that of the Skylark universe, in which faster-than-light travel is possible without even partial neutralization of inertia. So it is possible that Dr. Smith did not come up with the inertialess drive until writing the third installment.
The Rodebush-Cleveland drive, in contrast, causes “a sensation akin to a tremendously intensified vertigo” which was completely incapacitating until Cleveland’s “indomitable force of will” overcame it.
