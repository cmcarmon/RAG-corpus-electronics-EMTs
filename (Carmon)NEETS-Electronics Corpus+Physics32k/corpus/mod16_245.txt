A simplified diagram of a vibrating-reed frequency meter is shown in figure 2-8, views A through D.
In view A, you can see that the current to be measured flows through the coil and exerts maximum
attraction on the soft-iron armature twice during each cycle. The armature is attached to the bar, which is
mounted on a flexible support. Reeds of suitable dimensions to have natural vibration frequencies of 110,
112, 114, and so forth, up to 130 hertz are mounted on the bar (view B). The reed with a frequency of 110
hertz is marked 55 hertz; the one with a frequency of 112 hertz is marked 56 hertz; the one with a
frequency of 120 hertz is marked 60 hertz, and so forth.
