include all the four vertices of G. It is worth noting that a 2-tree is obtained from a tree by removing any one
of the branches from the tree; in general, a k-tree is obtained from a (k â€“ 1) tree by removing from it any one
1/6 ;  the  2-tree  admittance
of  its  branches.  Finally,  the  tree  admittance  product  of  the  tree  {e2,  e5,  e6}  is  1/2
product of the 2-tree {e3, e5} is  1/3
