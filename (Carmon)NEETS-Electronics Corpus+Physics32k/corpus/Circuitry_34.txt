The  triangle  shown  in  Fig.  1.6  should  help  you 
remember these relationships. 
  The  relationship,  P = I × V,  may  be  combined 
with that which results from Ohm’s Law (V = I ×
R)  to  produce  two  further  relationships.  First, 
substituting for V gives: 
 
P = I × (I × R) = I 2 R
Secondly, substituting for I gives: 
 
P = (V / R) × V = V 2 / R
