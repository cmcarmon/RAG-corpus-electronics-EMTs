The circuit shown in figure 4-49 is that of a full-wave voltage doubler. The main advantage of a 
full-wave doubler over a half-wave doubler is better voltage regulation, as a result of reduction in the 
output ripple amplitude and an increase in the ripple frequency. The circuit is, in fact, two half-wave 
rectifiers. These rectifiers function as series-aiding devices except in a slightly different way. During the 
alternation when the secondary of the transformer is positive at the top, C1 charges to 200 volts through 
CR1. Then, when the transformer secondary is negative at the top, C2 charges to 200 volts through CR2. 
R1 and R2 are equal value, balancing resistors that stabilize the charges of the two capacitors. Resistive 
load RL is connected across C1 and C2 so that R L receives the total charge of both capacitors. The output 
voltage is +400 volts when measured at the top of R L, or point "A" with respect to point "B." If the output 
is measured at the bottom of RL, it is âˆ’400 volts. Either way, the output is twice the peak value of the ac 
secondary voltage. As you can imagine, the possibilities for voltage multiplication are extensive.
