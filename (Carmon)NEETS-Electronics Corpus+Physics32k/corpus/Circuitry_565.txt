Recommended trigger pulse width:  
 
where ton and ttr are in seconds, C is in Farads and R
is in ohms. 
  The period of the 555 monostable output can be 
changed  very  easily  by  simply  altering  the  values 
of the timing resistor, R, and/or timing capacitor, C.
Doubling  the  value  of  R will  double  the  timing 
period.  Similarly,  doubling  the  value  of  C will 
double the timing period.
