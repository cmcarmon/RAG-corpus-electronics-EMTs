At the receiving station, there are usually no space restrictions in accommodating large antennas, sensitive
radio  tuners  and  recorders,  and  an  ample  power  supply,  but  the  transmitting  station  often  must  be  small,
possibly doughnut-size, but sometimes no bigger than a pea, and must be self-sufÔ¨Åcient, carrying its own power
or perhaps receiving it by radio.
