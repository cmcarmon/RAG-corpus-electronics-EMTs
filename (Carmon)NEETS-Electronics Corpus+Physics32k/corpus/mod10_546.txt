When a line is terminated in capacitance, the capacitor does not absorb energy, but returns all of the
energy to the circuit. This means there is 100 percent reflection. The current and voltage relationships are
somewhat more involved than in previous types of termination. For this explanation, assume that the
capacitive reactance is equal to the Z0 of the line. Current and voltage are in phase when they arrive at the
end of the line, but in flowing through the capacitor and the characteristic impedance (Z0) connected in
series, they shift in phase relationship. Current and voltage arrive in phase and leave out of phase. This
results in the standing-wave configuration shown in figure 3-34, view E. The standing wave of voltage is

capacitance), the termination looks more like an open circuit; the voltage minimum moves away from the
end. If the capacitive reactance is smaller than Z0, the minimum moves toward the end.
