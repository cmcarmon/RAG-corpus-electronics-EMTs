An interesting signal processing aspect of this example is demonstrated at the beginning and
end of the output. The ramping up and down that occurs can be traced to assuming the input is
zero before it begins and after it ends. The ﬁlter “sees” these initial and ﬁnal values as the diﬀerence
equation passes over the input. These artifacts can be handled in two ways: we can just ignore the
edge eﬀects or the data from previous and succeeding years’ last and ﬁrst week, respectively, can
be placed at the ends.
