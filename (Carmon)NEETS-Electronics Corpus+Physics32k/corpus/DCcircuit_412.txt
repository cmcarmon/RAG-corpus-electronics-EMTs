10 to the 18th power (1018) means 10 multiplied by itself 18 times, or a ”1” followed by 18
zeros. Multiplied by 6.25, it looks like ”625” followed by 16 zeros (take 6.25 and skip the decimal
point 18 places to the right). The advantages of scientiﬁc notation are obvious: the number isn’t
as unwieldy when written on paper, and the signiﬁcant digits are plain to identify.
