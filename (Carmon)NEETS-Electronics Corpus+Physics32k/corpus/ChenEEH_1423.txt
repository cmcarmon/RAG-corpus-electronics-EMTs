The vector dot product, which involves computing the sum
of products of corresponding elements in two vectors, is a
common algorithmic kernel in signal processing. Its use ranges
from ﬁlters and correlators to two-dimensional image trans-
forms, such as the discrete cosine transform. Benyamin et al.
(1999) describes a method for producing optimized reconﬁg-
urable hardware implementations of vector dot products. The
method is based on a novel representation of common sub-
expressions in constant data patterns. Whereas traditional
techniques such as distributed arithmetic require storage size
exponential in the number of vector elements, the storage
requirement of the proposed method usually grows linearly
with problem size.
