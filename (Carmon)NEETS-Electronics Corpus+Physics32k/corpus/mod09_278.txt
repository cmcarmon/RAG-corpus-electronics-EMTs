Figure 2-11 shows a tuned-base Armstrong oscillator as you will probably see it. R3 has been added 
to improve temperature stability. Bypass capacitor C3 prevents degeneration. C4 is an output coupling 
capacitor, and impedance-matching transformer T2 provides a method of coupling the output signal. T2 is 
usually a loosely coupled rf transformer which reduces undesired reflected impedance from the load back 
to the oscillator.
