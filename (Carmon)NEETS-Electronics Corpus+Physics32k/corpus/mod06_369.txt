As you should know, there are two ways to move an electron (and thus an electron beam): either
with a magnetic or with an electrostatic field. Because of this, there are three possible ways to move or
deflect an electron beam in a CRT: magnetically, electromagnetically, and electrostatically. All three
ways are used in electronics. In general, though, electrostatic and electromagnetic deflection are used
most often. Your TV set, for example, uses electromagnetic deflection, while much of the test equipment
in the Navy uses electrostatic deflection.
