DC Power Supplies
If  an  ac  source  is  used,  then  ac-to-dc converters explained  in  Section  30.2  can  be  used.  In  these  converters,
electrical isolation can only be provided by bulky line frequency transformers. The ac source can be rectiﬁed
with a diode rectiﬁer to get an uncontrolled dc, and then a dc-to-dc converter can be used to get a controlled
dc output. Electrical isolation between the input source and the output load can be provided in the dc-to-dc
converter using a high-frequency (HF) transformer. Such HF transformers have small size, light weight, and
low cost compared to bulky line frequency transformers. Whether the input source is dc (e.g., battery) or ac,
dc-to-dc converters form an important part of dc power supplies, and they are explained in this subsection.
