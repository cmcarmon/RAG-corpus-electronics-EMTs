Mobile satellite services (MSS) operating at L-band around 1.6 GHz have revolutionized communications
with  ships  and  aircraft,  which  would  normally  be  out  of  reliable  communications  range  of  terrestrial  radio
signals. The International Maritime Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) operates the dominant system of this
type.
