aspects of human endeavor, from everyday living (e.g., embedded
systems in VCRs/VCDs and microwaves, personal computers) to

computations for various aspects of scientiﬁc research, weather
prediction, modeling and simulation in astronomy and astro-
physics, control of complex machine tools) and to life- and
