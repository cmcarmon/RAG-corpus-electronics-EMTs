Ammeter sensitivity is determined by the amount of current required by the meter coil to produce
full-scale deflection of the pointer. The smaller the amount of current required to produce this deflection,
the greater the sensitivity of the meter. A meter movement that requires only 100 microamperes for full-
scale deflection has a greater sensitivity than a meter movement that requires 1 milliampere for the same
deflection.
