Figure 14.1.1 shows the functional block diagram of a signal-processing system. The information
source may be a speech (voice), an image (picture), or plain text in some language. The output
of a source that generates information may be described in probabilistic terms by a random
variable, when the random or stochastic signal is deÔ¨Åned by a probability density function. The
output of a source may not be deterministic, given by a real or complex number at any instant of
time. However, in view of the scope of this text, random signals and random processes are not
discussed here.
