tent. For example, the content value scores can be linked to the
distortion introduced from compressing the images or audio.
Otherwise, the content value scores can be tied directly to the
methods that manipulate the content or be assigned manually.
Figure 5.7 illustrates examples of the relative reciprocal content
value scores of different variations of a video media resource. In
this example, the original video (lower left) has the highest content
value. The manipulation of the video along the dimension of
Ô¨Ådelity or modality reduces the content value. For example, con-
verting the video to a sequence of images results in a small reduc-
tion in content value. Converting the video to a highly compressed
audio track produces a higher reduction in the content value.
