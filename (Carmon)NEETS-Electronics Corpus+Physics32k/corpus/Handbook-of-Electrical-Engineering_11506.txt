Smart/Optical Cards
Smart/optical cards provide a wide range of applications in the medical ﬁeld. The patient, the provider (e.g.,
physician, dentist, etc.), the hospital, and the insurer can all beneﬁt from such a card. The card will eventually
contain all data forms—voice, text, graphics, clinical images, document images, signals, and data values collected
from medical instrumentation. Besides patient identiﬁcation/demographics, medical history, medications, aller-
gies,  and  insurance  veriﬁcation,  the  system  could  contain  the  patient’s  picture,  ﬁngerprint,  digital  signature,
voice signature, and even genetic/blood information for security reasons.
