Historically, gain scheduled controllers have been comprised of
a set of linear controllers whose gains are adjusted according to
a scheduling law derived via heuristic methods, such as inter-
polating on gains, poles and zeros. Gain scheduling via the
linearization techniques described in Section 9.2 has tradition-
ally been justiﬁed through successful application. For add-
itional theoretical justiﬁcation, see Rugh (1991) and Shamma
and Athans (1990, 1991). Related theoretical work can be
found in the area of extended linearization Baumann and
Rugh (1986), which can be viewed as gain scheduling on
input, output, or state variables rather than exogenous sched-
uling variables. This approach involves nonlinear control
design in the spirit of the gain-scheduling approach described
in Section 9.2.
