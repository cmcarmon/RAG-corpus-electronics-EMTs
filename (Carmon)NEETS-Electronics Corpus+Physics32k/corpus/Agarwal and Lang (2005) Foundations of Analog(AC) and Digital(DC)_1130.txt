t i e d t o g e t h e r Let us derive the incremental model for a MOSFET that has
its gate and drain terminal tied together as shown in Figure 8.11. When the G and D
terminals of the MOSFET are tied together, we get an effective two-terminal device.
Let us denote the two terminals as D and S, respectively. Because the gate-to-source
voltage of the device is the same as the drain-to-source voltage, the current iDS through
the device is related to the voltage vDS across the device as
