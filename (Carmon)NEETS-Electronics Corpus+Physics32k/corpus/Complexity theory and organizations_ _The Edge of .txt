Organizational environments can be viewed as a system with coevolution. According to CAS theories, each agent inside the environment tries to get a better payoff, while most of the time, the results are greatly influenced by what other agents do. That creates a dynamic equilibrium of coevolution with small, medium, or large changes in outcomes, according to power law. Small changes can sometimes lead to extraordinary improvements, and that is the reason why systems that are at the edge of chaos can defeat those not. The best-run companies survive because they operate at the edge of chaos by relentlessly pursuing a path of continuous innovation, and, indeed, because they inject so much novelty and change into their normal operations, they constantly risk falling over the edge. An organization should maintain a balance between flexibility and stability to avoid failing.
