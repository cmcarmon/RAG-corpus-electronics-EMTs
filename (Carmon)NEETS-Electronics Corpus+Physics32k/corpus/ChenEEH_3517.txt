Some basic signals are worthy of special attention because they
play a particularly important role in the representation of
other more general signals, either because other signals can
be written as their weighted sum or integral or because they
have useful properties. Signals in this category include the unit
sample or unit impulse, the unit step, and the exponential
signal. Another signal that plays an important role is a time-
shifted version of a given signal. In the discrete-time case, this
may be viewed as a transformation of a signal x[n] given by
y ¼ Dn0 x and deﬁned by:
