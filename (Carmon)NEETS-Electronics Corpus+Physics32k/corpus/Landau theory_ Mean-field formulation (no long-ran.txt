Landau was motivated to suggest that the free energy of any system should obey two conditions:
It is analytic.
It obeys the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.
Given these two conditions, one can write down (in the vicinity of the critical temperature, Tc) a phenomenological expression for the free energy as a Taylor expansion in the order parameter.
