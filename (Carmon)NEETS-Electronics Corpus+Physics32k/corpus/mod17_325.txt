Transmitting antenna distribution systems perform the same functions as receiving systems. 
However, because of the higher power levels, design and fabrication problems are more difficult. The 
ideal design would be to have all the transmission lines designed for the highest power level. But because 
high-power patch cords are expensive, large, and difficult to handle, this approach is seldom followed.
