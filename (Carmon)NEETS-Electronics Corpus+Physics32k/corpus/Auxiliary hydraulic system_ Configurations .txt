Depending upon the vehicle, whether an excavator, a back-hoe or a front-end-loader, the auxiliary hydraulic system may vary. Vehicle interface fittings, length from pump to attachment and vehicle control systems require various configurations of an auxiliary hydraulic system. Auxiliary hydraulic systems usually include external fluid fittings to facilitate connecting and disconnecting the hydraulic fluid supply lines of the attachments to the vehicles' hydraulic pump. They also usually include valves configured to control the supply of hydraulic fluid through the fittings.
