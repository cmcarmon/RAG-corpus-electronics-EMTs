The stronger the magnetic field, the greater the 
 induced voltage. The faster the conductor moves 
through the field, the greater the induced voltage. 
Moving the conductor, the magnetic field, or both can 
produce motion between the conductor and the mag-
netic field. The maximum voltage is induced when the 
conductor moves at right angles to the field.  Angles 
less than 90ยบ induce less voltage. If a conductor is 
moved parallel to the flux lines, no voltage is induced. 
The longer the conductor is moving through the mag-
netic field, the greater the induced voltage.
