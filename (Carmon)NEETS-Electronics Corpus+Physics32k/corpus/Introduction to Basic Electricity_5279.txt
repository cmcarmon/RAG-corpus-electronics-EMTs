The  ohmmeter  function  of  a  multimeter  
(FigureÂ 50-1) is useful in troubleshooting for deter-
mining an open circuit with an infinite resistance 
or a short circuit with 0 resistance. When using the 
 ohmmeter for measuring individual component resis-
tance in a circuit, one lead from the component must 
be removed from the circuit for an accurate reading.
