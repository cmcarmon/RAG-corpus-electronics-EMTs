Logic gates in the NMOS logic family dissipate static power even when the
circuit is idle. In the example discussed earlier, the static power was nearly 100
times larger than the power associated with signal activity. Because the pullup
MOSFET is always on, the cause of the static power dissipation is the resistive
path from the power supply to ground when the pulldown MOSFET is on.
In this section, we introduce another type of logic called CMOS or Comple-
mentary MOS, which has no static power dissipation. Because of its low static
power dissipation,4 CMOS logic has all but replaced NMOS in modern VLSI
chips.
