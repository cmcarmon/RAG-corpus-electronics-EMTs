pH is deﬁned as follows: the lower-case letter ”p” in pH stands for the negative common
(base ten) logarithm, while the upper-case letter ”H” stands for the element hydrogen. Thus,
pH is a logarithmic measurement of the number of moles of hydrogen ions (H+) per liter of
solution. Incidentally, the ”p” preﬁx is also used with other types of chemical measurements
where a logarithmic scale is desired, pCO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and pO2 (Oxygen) being two such
examples.
