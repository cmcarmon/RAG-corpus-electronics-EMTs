Another important point to remember is that a diode should not be condemned because two
ohmmeters give different readings on the diode. This occurs because of the different internal resistances
of the ohmmeters and the different states of charge on the ohmmeter batteries. Because each ohmmeter
sends a different current through the diode, the two resistance values read on the meters will not be the
same.
