In true vacuum, inflaton particles decay, eventually giving rise to the observed Standard Model particles. The shape of potential energy function near "tunnel exit" from false vacuum state must have a shallow slope, otherwise particle production will be confined to the boundary of expanding true vacuum bubble, which contradicts observation (our Universe is not built of huge completely void bubbles). In other words, quantum state should "roll to bottom slowly".
When complete, decay of inflaton particles fills the space with hot and dense Big Bang plasma.
