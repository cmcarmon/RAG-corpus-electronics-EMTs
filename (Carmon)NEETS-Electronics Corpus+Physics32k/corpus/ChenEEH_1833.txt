In this section, we illustrate standards/protocols that have been
introduced to operate over the basic TCP/IP protocol stack to
satisfy the functional requirements of multimedia trafÔ¨Åc
streams. We later describe two protocol architectures: H.323
and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that have been standard-
ized to support these functional requirements. Again, to pre-
serve the brevity of this chapter, we do not discuss every such
approach at length but provide appropriate references for
interested readers.
