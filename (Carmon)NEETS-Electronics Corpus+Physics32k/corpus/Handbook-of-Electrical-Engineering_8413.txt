Here,  the  code  weights  are  80,  40,  20,  10;  8,  4,  2,  1;  0.8,  0.4,  0.2,  0.1;  and  0.08,  0.04,  0.02,  0.01  for  the  tens,
units,  tenths,  and  hundredths  digits,  respectively,  representing  four  decades.  Conversion  between  binary  and
NBCD requires conversion to decimal as an intermediate step. For example, to convert  from  NBCD  to  binary
requires that groups of four bits be selected in both directions from the radix point to form the decimal number.
If  necessary,  zeros  are  added  to  the  leftmost  or  rightmost  ends  to  complete  the  groups  of  four  bits  as  in  the
above  example.  Negative  NBCD  numbers  can  be  represented  either  in  sign-magnitude  notation  or  1’s  or  2’s
complement notation as discussed later.
