The  ﬁber  distributed  data  interface  (FDDI)  [Ross,  1986,  1989]  is  a  standard  proposed  by  the  American
National Standard Institute for a 100-Mb/s double-ring, time-division multiplexed (TDM) LAN that uses 1.3-
mm multimode ﬁber and LED (or single-mode ﬁber and laser diode) data links between stations. This LAN is
designed  to  provide  both  backbone  services  that  interconnect  lower  speed  LANs  and  back-end  services  that
interconnect  mainframe  computers,  mass  storage  systems,  and  other  high-speed  peripherals.  FDDI  provides
datagram packet service with up to about 4,500 data bytes per frame. It employs 4B/5B coding so that the clock
rate  is  125  MHz  for  maximum  S  of  100  Mb/s.  The  FDDI  network  is  designed  to  operate  with  low-cost
components  that  were  commercially  available  in  1986.  The  standard  can  provide  both  packet-switched  and
circuit-switched services. As many as 1000 stations can be connected, with a maximum of 2 km between stations
and a maximum perimeter of 200 km.
