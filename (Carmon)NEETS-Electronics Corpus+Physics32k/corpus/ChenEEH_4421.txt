function (Newcomb, 1966; Desoer and Vidyasagar, 1975).
The concept of strict positive realness has also been deÔ¨Åned
in the literature and is closely related to strict passivity.
Let G(s) denote a p  p matrix whose elements are proper
rational functions of the complex variable s. The G(s) is said
to be stable if all its elements are analytic in Re(s)  0. Let
the conjugate-transpose of a complex matrix H be denoted
by H H.
