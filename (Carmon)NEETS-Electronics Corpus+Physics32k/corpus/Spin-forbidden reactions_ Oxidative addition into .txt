Through the use of photolysis, the rate of oxidative addition into silicon-hydrogen bonds has been shown to increase when the starting material is excited to the correct spin-state. CpRe(CO)2 and CpMn(CO)2 were subjected to photolysis to change their spin states from triplet to singlet and vice-versa, respectively, such that an oxidative addition to Et3Si-H could occur at a greatly accelerated rate.
