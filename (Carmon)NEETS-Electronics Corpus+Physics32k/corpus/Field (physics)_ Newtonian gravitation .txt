A classical field theory describing gravity is Newtonian gravitation, which describes the gravitational force as a mutual interaction between two masses.
Any body with mass M is associated with a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other bodies with mass. The gravitational field of M at a point r in space corresponds to the ratio between force F that M exerts on a small or negligible test mass m located at r and the test mass itself:

F

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}.}

Stipulating that m is much smaller than M ensures that the presence of m has a negligible influence on the behavior of M.
According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, F(r) is given by

is a unit vector lying along the line joining M and m and pointing from m to M. Therefore, the gravitational field of M is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}=-{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}.}

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to an unprecedented level of accuracy leads to the identity that gravitational field strength is identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity.
Because the gravitational force F is conservative, the gravitational field g can be rewritten in terms of the gradient of a scalar function, the gravitational potential Φ(r):
