. Transparent bridge: The algorithm was developed by
IEEE 802.1 and intended to interconnect similar LAN or
dissimilar LAN (IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.4, and IEEE 802.5)
and learn in which side of LAN a MAC station would
reside by examining the source and destination addresses.
The main idea is for the bridges to select the ports over
which they will forward frames. The algorithm uses graph
theory to construct a spanning tree to avoid a closed loop
to forward the frame. The algorithm selects one root
bridge for the network, one designated port for each
bridge, and one designated bridge for each LAN. All
frames will be forwarded toward the root bridge via the
designated bridge and the designated port. The root
bridge then forwards the frames via all of its ports. The
root bridge has the smallest ID, and each bridge computes
the shortest path to the root and notes which port is on
the path. The designated port is the preferred path to the
root. Each LAN selects a designated bridge that will be
responsible for forwarding frames toward the root bridge.
The winner is the bridge closer to the root and has the
smaller ID.
