The conducting n-channel that is formed in the MOSFET discussed here
is not an ideal conductor and has some resistance RON. Also notice that the
resistance of the gate is related to the geometry of the channel. Let the channel
length be L and the channel width be W. Then, the resistance is proportional
to L/W. If Rn is resistance per square of the n-channel MOSFET in its on state,
then the resistance of the channel is given by
RON = Rn
