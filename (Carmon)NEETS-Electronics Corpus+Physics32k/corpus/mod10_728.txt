Parasitic arrays represent another method of achieving high antenna gains. A parasitic array consists 
of one or more parasitic elements placed in parallel with each other and, in most cases, at the same 
line-of-sight level. The parasitic element is fed inductively by radiated energy coming from the driven 
element connected to the transmitter. It is in NO way connected directly to the driven element.
