element, not counting the voltage and current independent
sources. A circuit element is called nonlinear if its constitutive
relationship between its voltage (established across) and its
current (ﬂowing through) is a nonlinear function or a non-
linear relation. All physical circuits are nonlinear. When ana-
lyzing circuits, we often simplify the behavior of circuit
elements and model them as linear elements. This simpliﬁes
the model of the circuit to a linear system, which is then
described by a set of linear equations that are easier to solve.
In many cases, this simpliﬁcation is not possible and the non-
linear elements govern the behavior of the circuit. In such
cases, approximation to a linear circuit is possible only over
a limited range of circuit variables (voltages and currents),
over a limited range of circuit parameters (resistance, capaci-
tance, or inductance), or over a limited range of environmental
conditions (temperature, humidity, or aging) that may affect
the behavior of the circuit. If global behavior of a circuit is
sought, linearization is often not possible and the designer has
to deal with the circuit’s nonlinear behavior (Chua et al., 1987;
Hasler and Neirynck, 1986; Mathis, 1987; Willson, 1975).
