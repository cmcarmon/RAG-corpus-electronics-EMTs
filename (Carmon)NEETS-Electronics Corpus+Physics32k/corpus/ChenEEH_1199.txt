The main drawbacks to C4 regard the use of lead in the solder
bumps that lead to the emission of alpha particles, which, in
turn can lead to circuit failure in sensitive circuits such as
DRAMs. Restricting the placement of solder bumps over these
sensitive areas’ however, can minimize this effect. Research is
ongoing to ﬁnd alternate materials for solder bumps as well. In
addition, the use of C4 packaging allows designers to do many
different things in the ﬂoor planning and routing stages of a
design. Commercial tools for place-and-route and other such
designs are predicated on the use of peripheral wire bonding for
I/O pads. New tools need to be in place for designers to take full
advantage of ﬂip-chip’s advantages.
