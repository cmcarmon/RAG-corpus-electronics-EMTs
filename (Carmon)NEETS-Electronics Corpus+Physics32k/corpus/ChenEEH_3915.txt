maximizing fSjX (sjx). Thus, ^ssMAP(x) is the value of s that
maximizes fSjX (sjx).
Normally, it is often more convenient (for algebraic ma-
nipulation) to consider ln fSjX (sjx), especially since ln (x) is a
monotone nondecreasing function of x. A necessary condition
for maximizing ln fSjX (sjx) is as written here:
