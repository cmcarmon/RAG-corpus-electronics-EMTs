Many different kinds of outer covering are used on paper capacitors, the simplest being a tubular
cardboard covering. Some types of paper capacitors are encased in very hard plastic. These types are very
rugged and can be used over a much wider temperature range than can the tubular cardboard type. Figure
3-15(A) shows the construction of a tubular paper capacitor; part 3-15(B) shows a completed cardboard-
encased capacitor.
