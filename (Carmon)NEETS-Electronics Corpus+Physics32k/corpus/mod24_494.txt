There are two basic techniques for measuring the modal bandwidth of an optical fiber. The first
technique characterizes dispersion by measuring the impulse response h(t) of the fiber in the time
domain. The second technique characterizes modal dispersion by measuring the baseband frequency
response H(f) of the fiber in the frequency domain. H(f) is the power transfer function of the fiber at the
baseband frequency (f). H(f) is also the Fourier transform of the power impulse response h(t). Only the
frequency response method is described here.
