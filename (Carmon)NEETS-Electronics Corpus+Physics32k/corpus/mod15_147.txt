When a torque transmitter is connected to a torque receiver (TX-TR), very little, if any, current flows 
in the stators when the rotors are in correspondence. This is because the voltages induced in the TR 
windings almost exactly balance out the voltages induced in the TX windings. As a result, the TR is very 
sensitive to small changes in the position of the TX rotor, causing the TR to follow the TX with a high 
degree of accuracy.
