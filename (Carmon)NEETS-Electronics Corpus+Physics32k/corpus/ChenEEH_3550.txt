Fourier transforms are useful, but they exist for a restricted
class of signals. They can be generalized so that the generaliza-
tion exists for a larger class of signals. These generalizations
provide additional insights into system analysis and design. If
time is discrete, the generalization is called the z-transform.
The deﬁnition of the DTFT is modiﬁed by replacing ejv by a
complex variable z ¼ rejv. In the case of continuous time,
the deﬁnition of the CTFT is modiﬁed by replacing jV by
a complex variable s ¼ s þ jV.
