Optimal control and estimation is an actively growing ﬁeld of control systems research. Classic texts in the area
include [Kirk, 1970] and [Bryson and Ho, 1975] for optimal control systems, and [Anderson and Moore, 1979]
for Kalman ﬁltering, with the original source being [Kalman, 1960]. Further information on H2 and H∞ theory
can be found in [Doyle, et al., 1989], [Zhou and Doyle, 1998], [Green and Limebeer, 1995], and [Francis, 1987].
