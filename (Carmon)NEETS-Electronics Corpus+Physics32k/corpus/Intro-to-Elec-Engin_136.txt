or d2 cmil. The handbook for aluminum electrical
conductors lists a dc resistance of 0.01558  per
1000 ft at 20°C for Marigold conductor, whose
size is 1113 kcmil.
(a) Verify the dc resistance assuming an increase
in resistance of 3% for spiraling of the strands.
(b) Calculate the dc resistance at 50°C, given
that the temperature constant for aluminum
is 228.1°C.
