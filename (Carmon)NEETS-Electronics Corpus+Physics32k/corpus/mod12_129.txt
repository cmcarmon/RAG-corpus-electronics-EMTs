MULTISTAGE HIGH-POWER TRANSMITTERS.â€”The power amplifier of a high-power 
transmitter may require far more driving power than can be supplied by an oscillator. Therefore, one or 
more low-power intermediate amplifiers may be inserted between the oscillator and the final power 
amplifier to boost power to the antenna. In some types of equipment, a VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER, called a 
BUFFER is used between the oscillator and the first intermediate amplifier. The ideal buffer is operated 
class A and is biased negatively to prevent grid current flow during the excitation cycle. Therefore, it does 
not require driving power from, nor does it load down, the oscillator. The purpose of the buffer is to 
isolate the oscillator from the following stages and to minimize changes in oscillator frequency that occur 
with changes in loading. A buffer is required when keying takes place in an intermediate or final amplifier 
operating at comparatively high power. Look at the block diagrams of several medium-frequency 
transmitters in figure 1-30. The input and output powers are given for each stage. You should be able to 
see that the power output rating of a transmitter can be increased by adding amplifier tubes capable of 
delivering the power required.
