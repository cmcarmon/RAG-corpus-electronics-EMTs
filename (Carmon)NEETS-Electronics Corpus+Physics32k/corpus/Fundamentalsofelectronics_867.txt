Figure 6.18: We form a Huﬀman code for a four-letter alphabet having the indicated probabilities of
occurrence. The binary tree created by the algorithm extends to the right, with the root node (the one
at which the tree begins) deﬁning the codewords. The bit sequence obtained by traversing the tree from
the root to the symbol deﬁnes that symbol’s binary code.
