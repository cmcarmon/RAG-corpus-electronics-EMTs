The simplified illustration of an absorption wavemeter, shown in figure 2-11, consists of a pickup
coil, a fixed capacitor, a lamp, a variable capacitor, and a calibrated dial. When the wavemeterâ€™s
components are at resonance, maximum current flows in the loop, illuminating the lamp to maximum
brilliance. The calibrated dial setting is converted to a frequency by means of a chart, or graph, in the
instruction manual. If the lamp glows very brightly, the wavemeter should be coupled more loosely to the
circuit. For greatest accuracy, the wavemeter should be coupled so that its indicator lamp provides only a
faint glow when tuned to the resonant frequency.
