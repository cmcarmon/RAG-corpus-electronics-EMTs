devices, however, are only components that are used in larger
and more complex systems. That is, individual sensors or
actuators can be used as components and incorporated into
subsystems or systems to perform some useful function. The
accelerometer in the air bag subsystem of an automobile and
the DMD in a projection system in a theater are examples. It is
also possible to closely couple both MEMS sensors and actu-
ators into miniature systems all on one substrate. These are
called ‘‘systems on a chip.’’ Microﬂuidics with all the needed
functionality on a substrate, including pumps and valves, as
well as channels, mixers, separators and detectors, are under
development for compact analyzers. These will be relatively
evolutionary advances over current microﬂuidic chips. High-
density data storage systems with both actuation and sensing
functions represent a more revolutionary example of inte-
grated microsystems.
