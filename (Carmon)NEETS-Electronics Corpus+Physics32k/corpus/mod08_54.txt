A POWER AMPLIFIER is an amplifier in which the output signal power is greater than the input 
signal power. In other words, a power amplifier amplifies the power of the input signal. Most power 
amplifiers are used as the final amplifier (stage of amplification) and control (or drive) the output device. 
The output device could be a speaker, an indicating device, an antenna, or the heads on a tape recorder. 
Whatever the device, the power to make it work (or drive it) comes from the final stage of amplification 
which is a power amplifier.
