By construction, this expression is in a sum-of-products form. It has three
product terms corresponding to the three 1â€™s in the output column of the truth
table. Since X and Y appear as a 0 and a 1, respectively, in the first row with a 1
output, they contribute the product term X Y to the overall expression for Z.
Similarly, the remaining two product terms come from the third and fourth
rows of the truth table, respectively.
