Similar transient behavior of the primary current is seen in a
transformer connected in parallel to a transformer that is being
energized. The change in the magnetizing current is affecting
the primary current of the parallel transformer due to an
inrush created on the transformer being energized. This phe-
nomenon is called sympathetic inrush. Sudden removal of an
external fault and a sudden increase in the transformer voltage
also cause the inrush phenomenon, again well recognized by
an occurrence of particular harmonics in the primary current.
