The three-phase system is by far the most common polyphase system used for generation,
transmission, and heavy power utilization of ac electric energy because of its economic and
operating advantages. An ideal three-phase source generates three sinusoidal voltages of equal
amplitudes displaced from each other by an angle of 120° in time. The voltages generated by
the giant synchronous generators in power stations are practically sinusoidal with a frequency
of 60 Hz in the United States, or 50 Hz in the United Kingdom and many other countries. Even
though voltages and currents are sinusoidal, the power delivered to a balanced load is constant
for a three-phase system. The three-phase scheme of power transmission offers the advantages of
using the ac mode, constant power ﬂow, and high power transfer capability.
