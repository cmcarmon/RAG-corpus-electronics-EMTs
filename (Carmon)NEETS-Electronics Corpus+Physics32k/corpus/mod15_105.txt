Even when the S1 and S3 connections are reversed, the system at 0ยบ acts the same as the basic 
synchro system we previously described at 0ยบ. This is because the voltages induced in the S1 and S3 
stator windings are still equal and oppose each other. This causes a canceling effect, which results in zero 
stator current and no torque. Without the torque required to move the receiver rotor, the system remains in 
correspondence and the reversing of the stator connections has no noticeable effect on the system at 0ยบ.
