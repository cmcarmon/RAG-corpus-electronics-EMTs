Here, there are several possible experiments on the activity of individual enzymes with a two-state signal. For example, one can create substrate that only upon the enzymatic activity shines light when activated (with a laser pulse). So, each time the enzyme acts, we see a burst of photons during the time period that the product molecule is in the laser area.
