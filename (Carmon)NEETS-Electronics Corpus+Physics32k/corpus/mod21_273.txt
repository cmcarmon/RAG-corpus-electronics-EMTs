The psp is easy to use. You have a choice of three pcb connectors (located on the top panel of the
test set) into which you insert the pcb being tested. The software program, which is provided on magnetic
tape cartridges, is then loaded into the test set. The test set automatically tests the pcb by applying input
signals to the appropriate pins while monitoring the output signal for a correct indication. An LED display
will give you a pass or fail indication. If a pcb fails the operational test, the psp tells you (via LED
display) what troubleshooting steps must be taken. The psp uses a guided probe fault isolation technique
that tells you what test points to check on the faulty pcb. The software program guides you from the faulty
output backwards toward the input until the fault is located. The probe is a standard 10 megohm, 10 to 1
oscilloscope probe. The guided probe circuitry and software is also unique because it is capable of
locating faults within feedback loops and can sense when you have placed the probe at an incorrect test
point.
