In electrostatic cgs units, the unit of electric charge, the statcoulomb, is defined so that the Coulomb constant, ke, or the permittivity factor, 4πε0, is 1 and dimensionless. Then the expression of the fine-structure constant, as commonly found in older physics literature, becomes




α
=



e

2



ℏ
c



.


{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {e^{2}}{\hbar c}}.}

In natural units, commonly used in high energy physics, where ε0 = c = ħ = 1, the value of the fine-structure constant is




α
=



e

2



4
π



.


{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi }}.}

As such, the fine-structure constant is just another, albeit dimensionless, quantity determining (or determined by) the elementary charge: e = √4πα ≈ 0.30282212 in terms of such a natural unit of charge.
In atomic units (e = me = ħ = 1 and ε0 = 1/4π), the fine structure constant is




α
=

c

{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{c}}.}
