power load P. However, the reactive power output of the gener-
ator will be the sum of the reactive load Q and the reactive
power ‘‘consumed’’ by the transmission line reactance x.
Let us write down the power ﬂow equations for this prob-
lem. Given a loading condition P þ jQ, we want to solve for
the unknown variables, namely, the bus voltage magnitude V
and the phase angle d. For simplicity, we will assume that the
load is at unity power factor of Q ¼ 0. The line current phasor
I from the generator bus to the load bus is easily calculated as:
