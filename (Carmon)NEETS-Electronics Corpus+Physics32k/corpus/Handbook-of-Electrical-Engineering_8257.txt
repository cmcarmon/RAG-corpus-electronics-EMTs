It  is  important  to  provide  storage  media  to  cater  to  large  streams  of  data  being  produced.  Data  acquisition
systems use graph paper, paper tapes, magnetic tapes, magnetic ﬂoppy disks, hard disks, or any combination
of these as their data recorders. Paper and magnetic tape storage schemes are known as sequential access storage,
whereas disk storage is called direct access storage. Tapes are cost-effective media compared to disk drives and
are still in wide use. In many laboratory situations it will be much more cost effective to network a number of
systems  to  a  single,  high-capacity  hard  drive,  which  acts  as  a  ﬁle  server.  This  adoption  of  digital  recording
provides  the  ultimate  in  signal-to-noise  ratio,  accuracy  of  signal  waveform  and  freedom  from  tape  transfer
ﬂutter. Data storage capacity, access time, transfer rate, and error rate are some of the performance indices that
are associated with these devices.
