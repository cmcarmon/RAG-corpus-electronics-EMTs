The  most  pressing  challenge  remains:  development  of  an  illumination  source  that  can  provide  a
brighter image with better colors than CRT technology. If this can be achieved, other beneﬁts will ﬂow
from the technology, with the potential to drastically reduce power consumption as well as cabinet size,
weight, and cost. Furthermore, the inherent digital nature of the imaging panels would make the resulting
product data compatible for the much touted merging of the Internet and television programming.
