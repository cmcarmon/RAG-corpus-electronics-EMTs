The following table refers to rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis:




s



{\displaystyle \mathbf {s} }
is arclength,




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is the distance from the axis to any point, and





a



t





{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} _{\mathbf {t} }}
is the tangential acceleration, which is the component of the acceleration that is parallel to the motion. In contrast, the centripetal acceleration,

r
