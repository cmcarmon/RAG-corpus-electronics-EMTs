Signals are then sent through the amplifier control, where they are used for signal monitoring 
purposes before being applied to the final rf amplifier (pa). The pa amplifies the signal to the final desired 
power level. The pa also contains variometers (variable inductors) for coupling. This coupled output is 
fed to the rf tuning unit.
