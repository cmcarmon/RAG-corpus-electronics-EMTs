Using FDTD and related methods, electromagnetic wave inter-
action problems can be modeled requiring the solution of
considerably more than 108 ﬁeld–vector unknowns. At this
level of complexity, it is possible to develop detailed, three-
dimensional models of complete engineering systems, includ-
ing the following:
