Marginal stability is also an important concept in the context of stochastic dynamics. For example, some processes may follow a random walk, given in discrete time as





x

t


=

x

t
âˆ’
1


+

e

t


,


{\displaystyle x_{t}=x_{t-1}+e_{t},}

where




e

t




{\displaystyle e_{t}}
is an i.i.d. error term. This equation has a unit root (a value of 1 for the eigenvalue of its characteristic equation), and hence exhibits marginal stability, so special time series techniques must be used in empirically modeling a system containing such an equation.
