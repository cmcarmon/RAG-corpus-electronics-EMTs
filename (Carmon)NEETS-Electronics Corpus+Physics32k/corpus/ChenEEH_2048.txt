In the past few years, a concerted effort by the worldwide Petri
net community has resulted in an international standard on
deﬁning high-level Petri nets (HLPN) (ISO/IEC, 2002) that
will profoundly help to facilitate and promote the research and
applications of these nets. In the following sections, we follow
as closely as possible the notations, concepts, and deﬁnitions
given in the standard documentation to introduce high-level
Petri nets, which are used later to deﬁne our extensions.
