Figure 2-26 illustrates a frequency multiplier known as a FREQUENCY DOUBLER or SECOND 
HARMONIC GENERATOR. As illustrated, the input is 1 megahertz and the output is 2 megahertz, or 
twice the input frequency. In other words, the second harmonic of 1 megahertz is 2 megahertz. The third 
harmonic (frequency tripler) would be 3 megahertz, or 3 times the input signal. The fourth harmonic 
(quadruplet) would be 4 megahertz, or 4 times the 1-megahertz input signal. The fourth harmonic 
generator (frequency quadruplet) is normally as high in multiplication as is practical, because at 
harmonics higher than the fourth, the output diminishes to a very weak output signal.
