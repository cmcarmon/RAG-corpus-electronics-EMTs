One type of fiber optic component that allows for the redistribution of optical signals is a fiber optic
coupler. A fiber optic coupler is a device that can distribute the optical signal (power) from one fiber
among two or more fibers. A fiber optic coupler can also combine the optical signal from two or more
fibers into a single fiber. Fiber optic couplers attenuate the signal much more than a connector or splice
because the input signal is divided among the output ports. For example, with a 1 Â· 2 fiber optic coupler,
each output is less than one-half the power of the input signal (over a 3 dB loss).
