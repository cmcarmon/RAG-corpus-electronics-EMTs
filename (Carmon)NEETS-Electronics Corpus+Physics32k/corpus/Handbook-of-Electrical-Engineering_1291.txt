In this latter representation, Yp and Xq are referred to as the (N + 1) ·  (p + 1) response matrix and the (N + 1)
·  (q + 1) excitation matrix, respectively. Similarly, ap and bq are the recursive coefficient vectors identifying the
recursive  operator. With  this  preliminary  development,  the  basic  attributes  characterizing  recursively  related
data are now formally spelled out [see Cadzow and Solomon, 1988].
Theorem 13. Let the excitation-response data (x(n),y(n)) for 0 £ n £ N be related through a reduced-order
recursive  relationship (˜p, ˜q)  in  which ˜p  £  p  and ˜q  £  q.  It  then  follows  that  the  extended-order  recursive
relationship (14.143) will always have a solution. Moreover, if the excitation and response matrices are full rank
so that
