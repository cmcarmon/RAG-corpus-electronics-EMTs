The preceding analysis of slab waveguides is in many ways
similar to, and constitutes a good introduction to, the more
complex  analysis  of  cylindrical  (optical)  ﬁbers.  Unlike  slab
waveguides,  cylindrical  waveguides  are  bounded  in  two
dimensions rather than one. Consequently, skew rays exist in
optical  ﬁbers,  in  addition  to  the  meridional  rays  found  in
slab waveguides. In addition to transverse modes similar to
those  found  in  slab  waveguides,  the  skew  rays  give  rise  to
hybrid modes in optical ﬁbers.
