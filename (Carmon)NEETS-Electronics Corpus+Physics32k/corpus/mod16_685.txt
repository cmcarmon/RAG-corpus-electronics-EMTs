The spectrum analyzer is used to examine the frequency spectrum of radar transmissions, local
oscillators, test sets, and any other equipment operating within its testable frequency range. With
experience, you will be able to determine definite areas of malfunctioning components within equipment.
Successful spectrum analysis depends on the proper operation of a spectrum analyzer and your ability to
correctly interpret the displayed frequencies. Although there are many types of spectrum analyzers, we
will use the Tektronix, Model 492 for our discussion.
