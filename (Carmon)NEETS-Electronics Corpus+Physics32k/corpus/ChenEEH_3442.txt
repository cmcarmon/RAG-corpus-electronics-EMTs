The CT ratio is 400/5 ¼ 80, which produces about 5 A in the
secondary winding. If one assumes that the CVT secondary
phase-to-ground voltage needs to be close to 69 V, then com-
puting the actual primary voltage and selecting the ratio to
produce the secondary voltage close to 69 V allows one to
calculate the CVT ratio. The primary phase-to-ground voltage
(10, 000) ¼ 79:67(10, 000) V. If we allow the
is equal to 138
secondary voltage to be 69.3 V, then the CVT ratio can be
selected as 79:67(10, 000)=69:3 ¼ 1150=1.
