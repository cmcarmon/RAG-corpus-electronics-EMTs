Schrödinger required that a wave packet solution near position r with wavevector near k will move along the trajectory determined by classical mechanics for times short enough for the spread in k (and hence in velocity) not to substantially increase the spread in r. Since, for a given spread in k, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant ħ, it is sometimes said that in the limit as ħ approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics. Great care is required in how that limit is taken, and in what cases.
The limiting short-wavelength is equivalent to ħ tending to zero because this is limiting case of increasing the wave packet localization to the definite position of the particle (see images right). Using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as ħ → 0:

{\displaystyle \sigma (x)\sigma (p_{x})\geqslant {\frac {\hbar }{2}}\quad \rightarrow \quad \sigma (x)\sigma (p_{x})\geqslant 0\,\!}

where σ denotes the (root mean square) measurement uncertainty in x and px (and similarly for the y and z directions) which implies the position and momentum can only be known to arbitrary precision in this limit.
One simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the expected position and expected momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the Ehrenfest theorem. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential

{\displaystyle m{\frac {d}{dt}}\langle x\rangle =\langle p\rangle ;\quad {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle p\rangle =-\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle .}

Although the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair



(
⟨

⟨

{\displaystyle (\langle X\rangle ,\langle P\rangle )}
were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be

{\displaystyle -V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle \right)}
,
which is typically not the same as

⟨

{\displaystyle -\left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle }
. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however,




V
′



{\displaystyle V'}
is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.
For general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will approximately follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
, then




V

(

{\displaystyle V'\left(\left\langle X\right\rangle \right)}
and




⟨


V

{\displaystyle \left\langle V'(X)\right\rangle }
will be almost the same, since both will be approximately equal to




V
′

(

)


{\displaystyle V'(x_{0})}
. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position. When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in both position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle remains well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.

where ρ is the probability density, into the Schrödinger equation and then taking the limit ħ → 0 in the resulting equation, yields the Hamilton–Jacobi equation.
The implications are as follows:
The motion of a particle, described by a (short-wavelength) wave packet solution to the Schrödinger equation, is also described by the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of motion.
The Schrödinger equation includes the wavefunction, so its wave packet solution implies the position of a (quantum) particle is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.
