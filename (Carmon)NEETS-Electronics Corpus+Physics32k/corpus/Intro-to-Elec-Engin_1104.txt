An induction machine, connected to a polyphase exciting source on its stator side, can be
made to generate (i.e., with the power ﬂow reversed compared to that of a motor) if its rotor is
driven mechanically by an external means at above synchronous speed, so that ωm > ωs and
the slip becomes negative. If the machine is driven mechanically in the direction opposite to
its primary rotating mmf, then the slip is greater than unity and the machine acts as a brake. For
example, let the machine be operating normally as a loaded motor; if two of the three phase supply
lines to the stator are reversed, the direction of the stator rotating mmf will reverse. The rotor will
