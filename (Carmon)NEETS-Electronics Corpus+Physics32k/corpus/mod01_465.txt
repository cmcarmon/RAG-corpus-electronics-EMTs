When the voltage across a load is held constant, the current depends solely upon the resistance of the
load. For example, figure 3-8 shows a graph with the voltage held constant at 12 volts. The independent
variable is the resistance which is varied from 2 ohms to 12 ohms. The current is the dependent variable.
Values for current can be calculated as:
