Noise in digital systems is typically characterized by the integ-
rity of the voltages that represent the logic 0 and logic 1 states.
Noise can manifest itself either during switching (when it may
result in switching times that exceed theoretical results) or in
static conditions. Even in CMOS logic, which nominally pro-
vides fully rail-to-rail logic levels, dynamic noise events can
momentarily perturb a voltage level. Deep submicron tech-
nologies, which typically employ supply voltages of under 1.8
V, may be especially susceptible to logic glitches or errors that
are induced by random coupled noise.
