In addition to these examples summarized in Table 7.1,
several efﬁcient formats of ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) ﬁlter
implementation using distributed arithmetic (White, 1989)
were reported by Goslin (1995). As discussed earlier, LUTs
are one of the fundamental constructs in FPGA. There are a
few more advantages of implementing DSP algorithms on
FPGA:
