An abutting discontinuity abuts against another discontinuity. Abutting discontinuities might continue at the other side of the intersecting discontinuity, however, with a displacement to give so-called ‘stepped planes’. Shear displacement along the discontinuity can take place if the shear strength along the discontinuity plane is exceeded, and the blocks of material against which the discontinuity abuts can move or break.
