Note that criteria shown in Fig. 26.15 are for any solderable surface, whether component or board, SMT or
THT. Some lead surfaces are deﬁned as not solderable, e.g., the cut and not-tinned end of an SO or QFP lead
is not considered solderable. Parts manufacturers will deﬁne whether a given surface is designed to be solderable.
