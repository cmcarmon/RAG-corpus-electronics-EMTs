If for example we know that the DTFT of the signal exists
(i.e., signal is absolutely summable), then we know that the
unit circle is included in the region of convergence. Among
the three previous regions, we choose the one that includes the
unit circle. In our example, b ¼ 1=2 and a ¼ 2, and therefore,
j < zj j < 2j j (i.e., region ROC2).
the ROC is the annulus 1=2
If the system is causal, then the z-transform converges in
the region outside the largest pole, which is region ROC3 in the
example.
