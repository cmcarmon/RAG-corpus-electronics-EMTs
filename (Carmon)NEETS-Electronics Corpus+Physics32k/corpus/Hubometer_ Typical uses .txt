They are needed on semi-trailers where they are the only means of measuring distance traveled over the lifetime of a tire or the trailer.
They are used on bus or truck or trailer wheels where the tires are supplied to the vehicle operator by an independent company on a contract of "price per thousand kilometers". The hubometer is installed by the tire company to give them their own measure.
In New Zealand hubodometers are used for the calculation of road user charges  for HGVs powered by a fuel not taxed at source.
