Maximum  planned  transmission  voltage  is  typically  105%  of  rated  nominal  voltage  for  both  normal  and
reasonable  emergency  conditions.  Typical  minimum  planned  transmission  voltages  are  given  in  Table 61.7.
System  conditions  in  Table 61.7  correspond  to  equipment  out  of  service  in  Table 61.6.  Single-contingency
outages  correspond  to  the  loss  of  any  line,  any  transformer,  or  any  generator.  Double-contingency  outages
correspond  to  the  loss  of  any  transmission  line  and  transformer,  any  transmission  line  and  generator,  any
transformer and generator, or any two generators.
