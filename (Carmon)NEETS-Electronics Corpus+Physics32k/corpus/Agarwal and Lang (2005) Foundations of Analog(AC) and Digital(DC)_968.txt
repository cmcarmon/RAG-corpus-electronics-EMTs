The use of the amplifier with an input DC offset (and a resulting output
offset) is important enough to merit some new terminology. The DC offset (for
example, VX) applied to the input of the amplifier is also called a DC bias. The
use of the DC offset voltage at the input establishes an operating point for the
amplifier. The operating point is sometimes referred to as the bias point. As an
example, the operating point values of the input and output voltages for the
amplifier in Figure 7.26 are VX and VY, respectively. We can select different
operating points for the amplifier by applying different values of the input DC
offset voltage. Section 7.7 discusses various methods of choosing an operating
point.
