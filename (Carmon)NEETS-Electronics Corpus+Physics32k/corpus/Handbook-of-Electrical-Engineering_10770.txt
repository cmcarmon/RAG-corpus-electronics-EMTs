Scheduled maintenance, under ideal conditions, takes very little time (compared to the time between main-
tenances) and the component is restored to an “as new” condition. Even if the component is not repairable,
scheduled  maintenance  postpones  failure  and  prolongs  the  life  of  the  component.  Scheduled  maintenance
makes  sense  only  for  those  components  with  increasing  hazard  rates.  Most  mechanical  systems  come  under
this  category.  It  can  be  shown  that  the  density  function  f T*(t) with  scheduled  maintenance  included  can  be
expressed as
