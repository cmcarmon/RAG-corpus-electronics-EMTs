Two deﬁnitions from a Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) publication [JCS, Pub. 1] capture the breadth of C2. This
reference deﬁnes command and control as “The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated
commander over assigned forces in the accomplishment of his mission. Command and control functions are
performed through an arrangement of personnel, equipment, communications, facilities, and procedures which
are employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating and controlling forces and operations in
the accomplishment of his mission.”
