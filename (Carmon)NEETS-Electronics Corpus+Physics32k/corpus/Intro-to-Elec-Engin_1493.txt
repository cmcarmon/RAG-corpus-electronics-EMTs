Sampling
This method was introduced in Section 14.2. Sampling of an analog signal makes it discrete in
time. A bandlimited signal can be recovered exactly from its samples, taken periodically in time
at a rate at least equal to twice the signalâ€™s bandwidth. If a message f (t) has a spectral extent of
Wf rad/s, the sampling rate fs (samples per second) must satisfy
