The handset converts acoustical energy (your voice) to electrical energy for use in modulating a 
radio transmitter. It also converts electrical energy to acoustical energy for reproduction of a received 
signal. When the push-to-talk button is depressed on the handset, the dc keying circuit to the transmitter is 
closed, placing the transmitter on the air.
