Our total circuit wire resistance is 2 times 5.651, or 11.301 Ω. Unfortunately, this is far too
much resistance to allow 25 amps of current with a source voltage of 230 volts. Even if our
load resistance was 0 Ω, our wiring resistance of 11.301 Ω would restrict the circuit current
to a mere 20.352 amps! As you can see, a ”small” amount of wire resistance can make a big
difference in circuit performance, especially in power circuits where the currents are much
higher than typically encountered in electronic circuits.
