Type II superconductors are of great technical importance because typical Hc2 values are at least an order of
magnitude greater than the typical Hc values of type I materials. It is therefore possible to use type II materials
to make high-ﬁeld magnet wire. Unfortunately, when current is applied to the wire, there is a Lorentz-like force
on  the  vortices,  causing  them  to  move.  Because  the  moving  vortices  carry  ﬂux,  their  motion  creates  a  static
voltage  drop  along  the  superconducting  wire  by  Faraday’s  law. As  a  result,  the  wire  no  longer  has  a  zero  dc
