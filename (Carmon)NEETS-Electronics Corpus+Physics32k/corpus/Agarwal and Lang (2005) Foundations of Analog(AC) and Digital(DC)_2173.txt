If the Op Amp integrator in Figure 15.19 is driven into negative saturation, then
the appropriate subcircuit is shown in Figure 15.29. Our negative saturation
model for the Op Amp says that vO is fixed at some voltage close to the
negative power supply voltage, sayâˆ’12 V. Because of the 12-V battery assumed
at the output when the Op Amp is in saturation, the dependent source is no
longer involved in the calculations, so the circuit reduces to a simple series RC
configuration, as indicated in Figure 15.29b.
