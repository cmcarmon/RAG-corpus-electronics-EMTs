The laser beam is scanned linearly over the PC in a direction orthogonal to the PC motion; the combined
motions  covering  a “page”.  The  most  common  gas  laser  scanning  technique  employs  a  high-speed  rotating
polygon mirror along with beam-expanding optics, an acoustic-optic modulator (not required for solid-state
lasers) and an f-q imaging lens. To produce a quality image, the multifaceted scanning mirror system must be
essentially  free  of  facet  defects,  up-and-down  wobble,  variations  in  polygon  rotational  velocity  and  lack  of
synchronization with the pixel clock. Some nonplanarity of the facet surfaces can be corrected with anamorphic
optics. LED arrays and liquid crystal shutter systems do not have these same technical challenges but, so far,
they are more expensive to produce.
