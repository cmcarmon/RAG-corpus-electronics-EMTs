Arithmetic instructions permit addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are common 
in all digital computers. Logic instructions allow comparison between variables, or between variables and 
constants. Transfer of control instructions are of two types, conditional and unconditional. Conditional 
transfer of control instructions are used to branch or change the sequence of program control, depending 
on the outcome of the comparison. If the outcome of a comparison is true, control is transferred to a 
specific statement number. If it proves false, processing continues sequentially through the program. 
Unconditional transfer of control instructions are used to change the sequence of program control to a 
specified program statement regardless of any condition.
