The  straight  line  relationship,  y = x, is  shown  in 
Fig. A8.13(a). This graph consists of a straight line 
with a gradient of 1 that passes through the origin 
(i.e. the point where x = 0 and y = 0). The graph has 
values in the first and third quadrants. 
  The  relationship  y = x2
is  shown  in  Fig. 
A8.13(b). This graph also passes through the origin 
but  its  gradient  changes,  becoming  steeper  for 
larger  values  of  x. As  you  can  see,  the  graph  has 
values in the first and second quadrants. 
  The  graph  of  y = x3 is  shown  in  Fig.  A8.13(c). 
This cubic law graph is steeper than the square law 
of  Fig.  A8.13(b)  and  it  has  values  in  the  first  and 
third quadrants. 
  Figure A8.13(d) shows the graph of y = x4. This 
graph is even steeper than those in Figs. A8.13(b) 
and  A8.13(c).  Like  the  square  law  graph  of  Fig. 
A8.13(b),  this  graph  has  values  in  the  first  and 
second quadrants. 
  The  graph  of  y = x5 is  shown  in  Fig.  A8.13(e). 
Like  the  cubic  law  graph  of  Fig.  A8.13(c),  this 
graph has values in the first and third quadrants. 
  Finally, Fig. A8.13(f) shows the graph of y = 1/x
(or y = x-1). Note how the  y  values are  very large 
for small values of x and very small for very large 
values of x. This  graph has  values  in  the  first and 
third quadrants.
