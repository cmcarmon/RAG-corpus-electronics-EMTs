Thévenin’s and Norton’s Theorems
Since the procedure using transformed circuits is identical to that using the phasor equivalent circuits in the
ac  steady-state  case,  we  may  obtain  transformed  Thévenin  and  Norton  equivalent  circuits  exactly  as  in  the
phasor  case.  That  is,  the  Thévenin  impedance  will  be  Zth(s)  seen  at  the  terminals  of  the  transformed  circuit
with the sources made zero, and the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current will be Voc(s) and Isc(s),
respectively, at the circuit terminals. The procedure is exactly like that for resistive circuits, except that in the
transformed circuit the quantities involved are functions of s. Also, as in the resistor and phasor cases, the open-
circuit voltage and short-circuit current are related by
