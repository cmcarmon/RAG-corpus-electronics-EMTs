To minimize the loading of a voltmeter on any circuit, the designer must seek to minimize
the current draw of its movement. This can be accomplished by re-designing the movement
itself for maximum sensitivity (less current required for full-scale deï¬‚ection), but the tradeoff
here is typically ruggedness: a more sensitive movement tends to be more fragile.
