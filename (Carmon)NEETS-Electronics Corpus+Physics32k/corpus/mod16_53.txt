SHIP CONFIGURATION AND LOGISTIC SUPPORT INFORMATION SYSTEM (SCLSIS) program
was designed to keep track of all installed and portable equipment in the fleet. SCLSIS is used to keep up
with the existence, location, and changes made to equipment. The SCLSIS program seeks to improve the
quality of equipment reporting, provide information needed by other Navy management systems, and
reduce record keeping. It is also designed to assist Navy supply systems that furnish spares,
documentation, and training necessary to support installed and portable equipment.
