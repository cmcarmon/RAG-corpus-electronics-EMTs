Invention of Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM).
Contextuality theoretically confirmed as necessary resource for achieving the advantages of quantum computation.
First demonstrated distribution of three entangled photons at three different locations (Alice, Bob and Charlie) several hundreds of metres apart.
Demonstration that an untrusted server can implement a universal set of quantum gates on encrypted qubits without learning any information about inputs, while the client, who knows the decryption key, can easily decrypt the results of the computation.
