ﬁrm. It has been estimated that due to such downtime and
associated system maintenance and recovery costs, the total
cost of ownership is ﬁve to ten times or more compared to
hardware and software purchase price (Patterson et al., 2002).
Consequently, system dependability today is a critical require-
ment
for high-performance multiprocessor systems. This
chapter focuses primarily on fault-tolerance techniques for
uniprocessor computer systems and will not discuss multipro-
cessor fault-tolerance methods. The reader is directed to the
various works cited previously for structural fault-tolerance
methods for multiprocessor systems. There also exists a consid-
erable amount of work on software-based fault-tolerance tech-
niques, primarily checkpointing and rollback recovery for
multiprocessor and distributed-processor systems that the
reader can also peruse: Chandy and Ramamoorthy, Elnozahy
et al. (2002), Huang and Kintala (1993), Koo and Toveg, Li and
Fuchs (1990), Long et al. (1992), Ssu et al. (1999), and Wang
et al., (1995). Both classes of fault-tolerance techniques, struc-
tural/hardware and software/rollback-recovery are important
for multiprocessor dependability.
