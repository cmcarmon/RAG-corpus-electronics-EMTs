The traditional engineering disciplines permeate many aspects of rehabilitation. Signal processing, control and
information theory, materials design, and computers are all in widespread use from an electrical engineering
perspective. Neural networks, microfabrication, fuzzy logic, virtual reality, image processing, and other emerg-
ing electrical and computer engineering tools are increasingly being applied. Mechanical engineering principles
are used in biomechanical studies, gait and motion analysis, prosthetic ﬁtting, seat cushion and back support
design, and the design of artiﬁcial joints. Materials and metallurgical engineers provide input on newer bio-
compatible materials. Chemical engineers are developing implantable sensors. Industrial engineers are increas-
ingly studying rehabilitative ergonomics.
