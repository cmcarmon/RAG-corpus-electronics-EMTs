Such circuits rely on the fact that diodes have very low
impedances  when  they  are  forward  biased  and  are  essentially  open  circuits  when  reverse  biased.  If  a  certain
constant
point in a circuit, such as the output of an ampliﬁer, is connected through a very small impedance to a 
voltage,  then  the  voltage  at  the  circuit  point  cannot  differ  signiﬁcantly  from  the  constant  voltage. We  say  in
 to the ﬁxed voltage. An ideal, forward-biased diode is like a closed switch,
this case that the point is 
so if it is connected between a point in a circuit and a ﬁxed voltage source, the diode very effectively holds the
point to the ﬁxed voltage. Diodes can be connected in operational ampliﬁer circuits, as well as other circuits,
