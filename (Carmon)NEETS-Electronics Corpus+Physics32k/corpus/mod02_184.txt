 1, the decreasing current causes progressively less voltage to be
dropped across the resistor (R), and more voltage builds up across the capacitor (C). At time t1, the voltage
felt across the capacitor is equal to the source voltage (6 volts), and the voltage dropped across the resistor
(R) is equal to zero. This is the complete charge cycle of the capacitor.
