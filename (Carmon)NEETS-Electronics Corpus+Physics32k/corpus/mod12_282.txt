When the reactance tube is connected across the tank circuit with no modulating voltage applied, it
will affect the frequency of the oscillator. The voltage across the oscillator tank circuit (L1 and C1) is also
in parallel with the series network of R1 and C7. This voltage causes a current flow through R1 and C7. If
R1 is at least five times larger than the capacitive reactance of C7, this branch of the circuit will be
essentially resistive. Voltage E
