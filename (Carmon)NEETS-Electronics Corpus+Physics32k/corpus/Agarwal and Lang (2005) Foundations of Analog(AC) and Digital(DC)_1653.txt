As evident from the previous examples, CMOS logic gates can be visualized as
comprising two complementary modules: the familiar pulldown circuit com-
prising NFETs, and a complementary pullup module using PFETs. If we are
interested in implementing the logic function f, the NFET pulldown network is
designed so it offers a short circuit when f is FALSE and an open circuit when
f is TRUE. Similarly, the PFET pullup network is designed so it offers a short
circuit when f is TRUE and an open circuit when f is FALSE. Thus, the CMOS
implementation of logic function f will assume the form shown in Figure 11.26.
