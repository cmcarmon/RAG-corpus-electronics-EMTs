Finally, it is important realize that the dynamic behavior of a real MOSFET
is actually much more complex than described here. In reality a MOSFET
actually has many internal capacitances of importance, including capacitances
between its gate and drain, its gate and source, its gate and substrate, its drain
and source, its drain and substrate, and its source and substrate. Further, most
of these capacitances are actually functions of vGS and vDS. For our purposes,
we will work primarily with CGS and assume that it is a constant capacitance.
