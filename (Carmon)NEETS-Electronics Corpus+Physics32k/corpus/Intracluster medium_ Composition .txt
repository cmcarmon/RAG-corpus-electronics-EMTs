The ICM is composed primarily of ordinary baryons, mainly ionised hydrogen and helium. This plasma is enriched with heavier elements, including iron. The amount of heavier elements relative to hydrogen, known as metallicity in astronomy, is roughly a third of the value in the sun. The metallicity rises from the outer region towards the center and in some clusters (e.g. the Centaurus cluster) the metallicity of the gas can rise above that of the sun. Due to the gravitational field of clusters, metal-enriched gas ejected from supernovae remains gravitationally bound to the cluster as part of the ICM. Studying the chemical composition of typical ICMs at varying redshift, which corresponds to looking at different epochs of the evolution of the Universe, can provide a history record of element production.
80-95% of the baryons in galaxy clusters reside in the ICM, rather than in the galaxies and single stars. However, most of the mass in a galaxy cluster consists of dark matter and not baryonic matter. For the Virgo Cluster, the ICM contains roughly 3 × 1014 M☉ - including all kinds of matter - while the total mass of the cluster is estimated to be 1.2 × 1015 M☉.
Although the ICM on the whole contains the bulk of a cluster's baryons, it is not very dense, with typical values of 10−3 particles per cubic centimeter. The mean free path of the particles is roughly 1016 m, or about one lightyear. The density of the ICM rises towards the centre of the cluster with a relatively strong peak. In addition, the temperature of the ICM typically drops to 1/2 or 1/3 of the outer value in the central regions. Once the density of the plasma reaches a critical value, enough interactions between the ions ensures cooling via X-ray radiation.
