The launch spot size is the area of the fiber face illuminated by the light beam from the optical
source. The diameter of the spot depends on the size of the optical source and the properties of the optical
elements (lenses, and so on) between the source and the fiber end face. The angular distribution is the
angular extent of the light beam from the optical source incident on the fiber end face. The launch angular
distribution also depends on the size of the optical source and the properties of the optical elements
between the optical source and the fiber end face.
