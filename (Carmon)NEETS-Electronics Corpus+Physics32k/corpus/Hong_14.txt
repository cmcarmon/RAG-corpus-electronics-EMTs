An  often  used  and  sometimes  confusing  term  in  electronic  circuits  is  the  word 
ground.  The ground is a circuit node to which all voltages in a circuit are referenced. In a 
constant  voltage  supply  circuit,  one  terminal  from  each  voltage  supply  is  typically 
connected  to  ground,  or  is  grounded.  For  example,  the  negative  terminal  of  a  positive 
power supply is usually connected to ground so that any current drawn out of the positive 
terminal  can  be  put  back  into  the  negative  terminal  via  ground.  Some  circuit  symbols 
used for ground are shown in Figure 1.9.
