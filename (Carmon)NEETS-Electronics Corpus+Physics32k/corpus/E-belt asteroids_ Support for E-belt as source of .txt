Examination of samples recovered from the Moon indicates that the impactors were thermally evolved objects. E-type asteroids, an example of this type, are uncommon in the main belt but become more common toward the inner belt and would be expected to be most common in the E-belt. The Hungaria asteroids, which are a remnant of the E-belt in this model, contain a sizable fraction of E-type asteroids.
The decay of the population of E-belt asteroids captured onto Hungaria like orbits produces a long-lived tail of impacts which continues past the LHB. The continuation of the bombardment is predicted to generate basin-forming impacts on the Earth and Chicxulub-sized craters on the Earth and Moon. Impact craters on the Moon and impact spherule beds found on the Earth dated to this period are consistent with these predictions.
The E-belt model predicts a remnant population will remain on Hungaria-like orbits. The initial population of E-belt asteroids was calculated based on the population of potential basin-forming impactors remaining among the Hungaria asteroids. The result was consistent with calculations based on the recent estimates of the orbital density of the main asteroid belt before the planetary migration.
