This flow of electric current appears to happen instantaneously. That’s 
because each free electron — from one end of a conductor to the other — 
begins to move more or less immediately, jumping from one atom to the next. 
So each atom simultaneously loses one of its electrons to a neighboring atom 
and gains an electron from another neighbor. The result of this cascade of 
jumping electrons is what we observe as electric current.
