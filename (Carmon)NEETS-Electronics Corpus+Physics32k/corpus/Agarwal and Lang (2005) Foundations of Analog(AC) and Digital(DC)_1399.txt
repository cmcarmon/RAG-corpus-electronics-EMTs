These waveforms are shown in Figure 10.9b. Notice that the inductor current
has an initial value of 0 and a final value of V/R. Thus the inductor behaves like
an instantaneous open circuit at t = 0 and a short circuit for large t, for the step
voltage input at t = 0. vL is correspondingly V at t = 0 and 0 for large t.
