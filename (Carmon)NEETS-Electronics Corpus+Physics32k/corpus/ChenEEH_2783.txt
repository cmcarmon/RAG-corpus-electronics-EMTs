The general ﬁeld vector postulated in equation 9.65 permits a
numerical wave amplitude that is either constant, exponen-
tially growing, or exponentially decaying as time-stepping pro-
gresses. Min and Teng (2001) have identiﬁed a linear growth
mode, (i.e., a linear instability) that can occur if the normal-
ized Courant factor equals exactly 1. While this growth mode is
much slower than the exponential instability discussed previ-
ously, the analyst should proceed with caution when using
Snorm ¼ 1.
