2.3   A  batch  of  resistors  are  all  marked  yellow,
 
violet,  black,  gold.  If  a  resistor  is  selected 
from  this  batch,  within  what  range  would 
 
 
you expect its value to be? 
2.4   Resistors of 27 $, 33 $, 56 $ and 68 $ are 
available. How can two or more of these be 
 
 
arranged  to  realize  the  following  resistance 
values? 
 
 
(a) 60 $
(b) 14.9 $
(b) 124 $
(b) 11.7 $
(b) 128 $.
