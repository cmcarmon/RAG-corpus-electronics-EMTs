There are three conditions to be fulfilled for the validity of Coulomb's law:
The charges must have a spherically symmetric distribution (e.g. be point charges, or a charged metal sphere).
The charges must not overlap (e.g. they must be distinct point charges).
The charges must be stationary with respect to each other.
The last of these is the most important - it is known as the electrostatic approximation. When movement takes place, Einstein's theory of relativity must be taken into consideration, and a result, an extra factor is introduced, which alters the force produced on the two objects. This extra part of the force is called the magnetic force, and is described by magnetic fields. For slow movement, the magnetic force is minimal and Coulomb's law can still be considered approximately correct, but when the charges are moving more quickly in relation to each other, the full electrodynamic rules (incorporating the magnetic force) must be considered.
