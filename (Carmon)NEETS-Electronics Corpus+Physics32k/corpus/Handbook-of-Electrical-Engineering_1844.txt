In the electrical engineering and geophysics literature, the generating function W(z1,z2,z3) is sometimes called
the z-transform of the sequence {w(i1, i2, i3)}. When there are a ﬁnite number of sensors, a realistic assumption
for any physical discrete array, W(z1,z2,z3) becomes a trivariate polynomial. In the special case when w(i1, i2, i3)
is product separable, the polynomial W(z1,z2,z3) is also product separable. Particularly, this separability property
holds when the shading is uniform, i.e., w(i1, i2, i3) = 1. When the support of the uniform shading function is
deﬁned by i1 = 0,1, . . ., N1 – 1, i2 = 0,1, . . ., N2 – 1, and i3 = 0,1, . . ., N3 – 1, the associated polynomial becomes
