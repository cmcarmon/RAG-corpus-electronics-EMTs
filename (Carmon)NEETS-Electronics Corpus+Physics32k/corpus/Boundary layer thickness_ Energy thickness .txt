The energy thickness,




δ

3




{\displaystyle \delta _{3}}
, is the distance by which a surface would have to be moved parallel to itself towards the reference plane in an inviscid fluid stream of velocity




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
to give the same total kinetic energy as exists between the surface and the reference plane in a real fluid.
The definition of the energy thickness for compressible flow is based on mass flow rate:

{\displaystyle \delta _{3}=\int _{0}^{\infty }{{\rho (y)u(y) \over \rho _{0}u_{o}}{\left(1-{u(y)^{2} \over u_{o}^{2}}\right)}}\,\mathrm {d} y}

The definition for incompressible flow can be based on volumetric flow rate, as the density is constant:

Where




ρ

{\displaystyle \rho _{0}}
and




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
are the density and velocity in the 'free stream' outside the boundary layer, and



y


{\displaystyle y}
is the coordinate normal to the wall.
