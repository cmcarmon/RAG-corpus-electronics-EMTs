c) Division can be performed by subtracting logarithms. Using this fact, construct a
circuit that produces an output voltage that is proportional to the quotient of two
input voltages. State the input-output relation of the circuit, and state the range of
input voltages over which the circuit will act as a divider.
Exponentiation can be performed by scaling logarithms. Using this fact, con-
struct circuits that produce an output voltage that is proportional to the square
and cube, respectively, of an input voltage. State the input-output relation of the
circuits, and state the range of input voltages over which the circuits will act as
exponentiators.
