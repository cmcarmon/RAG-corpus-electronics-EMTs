A half-wave antenna (referred to as a dipole, Hertz, or doublet) consists of two lengths of wire rod, 
or tubing, each 1/4 wavelength long at a certain frequency. It is the basic unit from which many complex 
antennas are constructed. The half-wave antenna operates independently of ground; therefore, it may be 
installed far above the surface of the Earth or other absorbing bodies. For a dipole, the current is
