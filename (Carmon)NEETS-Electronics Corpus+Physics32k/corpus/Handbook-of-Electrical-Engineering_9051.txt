Special thermal paper typically has a coating with a leuco dye plus a phenol developer in a polymer binder
which  react  at  the  elevated  temperature  provided  by  the  printhead  to  form  a  colored  species.  The  resulting
optical density is a function of the temperature reached so that some gray-scale capability is possible. Energy
density requirements are in the range of 2â€“6 J/cm2.
