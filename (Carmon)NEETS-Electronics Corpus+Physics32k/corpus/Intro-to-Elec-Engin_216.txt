Figure E3.1.3 RLC series circuit with sinusoidal excitation. (a) Time-domain circuit with a sinusoidal
excitation. (b) Time-domain circuit with exponential excitations. (c) Transformed networks (one with s = j ω
and the other with s = −j ω).
In view of the redundancy that is found in the information contained in ¯I1 and ¯I2 as seen
(Vmej φ)ej ωt = ¯Vmej ωt produces an exponential response i(t ) =(cid:21)
from Example 3.1.3, only one component needs to be considered for the purpose of ﬁnding
the sinusoidal steady-state response. Notice that an exponential excitation of the form v(t) =
ej ωt = ¯Imej ωt , whereas
a sinusoidal excitation of the form v(t ) = Vm cos (ωt + φ) produces a sinusoidal response
i(t ) = Im cos (ωt + θ ). The complex terms ¯Vm = Vmej φ and ¯Im = Imej θ are generally known as
