As the ﬁeld current rises the stator voltage increases propor-
tionally. For most machines at about 80% of rated voltage, the
curve becomes nonlinear, showing the effects of magnetic sat-
uration. If the straight line characteristic is continued, the so-
called air-gap line results, which is shown dotted in the ﬁgure.
In the short circuit test, the rotor is turned at rated speed
with a three-phase short circuit on the stator. As before,
increasing the ﬁeld current allows the plotting of the stator
current versus the ﬁeld current. A typical short circuit char-
acteristic is also shown in Figure 4.26. The short circuit
characteristic is linear. The ﬂux density in the machine is
