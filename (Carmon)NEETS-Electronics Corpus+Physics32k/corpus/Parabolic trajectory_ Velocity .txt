The orbital velocity (



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
) of a body travelling along parabolic trajectory can be computed as:




v
=




2
μ


r






{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {2\mu  \over {r}}}}

where:




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the radial distance of orbiting body from central body,




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
At any position the orbiting body has the escape velocity for that position.
If the body has the escape velocity with respect to the Earth, this is not enough to escape the Solar System, so near the Earth the orbit resembles a parabola, but further away it bends into an elliptical orbit around the Sun.
This velocity (



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
) is closely related to the orbital velocity of a body in a circular orbit of the radius equal to the radial position of orbiting body on the parabolic trajectory:




v
=


2


⋅

v

o




{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {2}}\cdot v_{o}}

where:





v

o





{\displaystyle v_{o}\,}
is orbital velocity of a body in circular orbit.
