With the plate POSITIVE relative to the filament, the filament hot, and the circuit completed as
shown, the ammeter detected a current flowing in the plate circuit. Because current is the same in all parts
of a series circuit, we know that the same current must flow across the space between filament and plate.
We know now that the electrons boiled from the heated filament are NEGATIVE and are attracted to the
POSITIVE plate because UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT.
