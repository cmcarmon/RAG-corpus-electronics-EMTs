Frequently it is necessary to set up a TX-TDX-TR system for addition. This is done by reversing the 
S1 and S3 leads between the TX and the TDX, and the R1 and R3 leads between the TDX and the TR. 
With these connections, the system behaves as illustrated in figure 1-21. Consider what happens when the 
TX rotor is turned to 75º, while the TDX is set at 0º view A. In the TX, with the rotor at 75º, increased 
coupling between the rotor and S1 increases the current in, and consequently the magnetic field around, 
that coil. At the same time, the field strengths of S2 and S3 decrease proportionately. This causes the 
resultant field of the TX stator to rotate counterclockwise and align itself with its rotor field. The system 
is now connected so the increased current in S1 of the TX flows through S3 of the TDX, while decreased 
currents flow through S1 and S2. Therefore, in the TDX, the resultant stator field is shifted 75º clockwise 
because of the stronger field around S3. Since the rotor of the TDX is on 0º, the voltage in the rotor is not 
changed but simply passed on to the TR. Remember, the R1 and R3 leads between the TDX and the TR 
have also been reversed. Just as in the simple TX-TR system with S1 and S3 leads interchanged, torque is 
developed in the TR, which turns the rotor in a direction opposite to the rotation of the TDX stator field. 
Therefore, the TR rotor rotates 75º counterclockwise and aligns itself with the TX rotor. Thus, the TX-
TDX-TR system connected for addition behaves in the same way as the system connected for subtraction 
as long as the TDX rotor remains on 0º. When this condition exists, the TR rotor follows the TX rotor 
exactly. As you can see, the system in view. A just solved the equation 75º  + 0º  = 75º.
