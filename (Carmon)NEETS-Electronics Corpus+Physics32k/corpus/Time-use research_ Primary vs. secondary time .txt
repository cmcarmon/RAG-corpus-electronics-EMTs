The distinction between primary and secondary time is a way to include activities when multitasking. Activities that take place at the same time are separated into primary and secondary categories based on priority assigned to each, with the activity with the highest priority considered to be the primary. This distinction plays an important role when evaluating time spent on activities that often considered secondary when multitasking, as overlooking secondary activities can lead to significant underestimations of the time committed to those activities.
According to research in Australia, approximately two thirds of time spent on childcare is considered secondary time. Research in the United States is more variable ranging from approximately one third to approximately three fourths of time spent on childcare being secondary time.
