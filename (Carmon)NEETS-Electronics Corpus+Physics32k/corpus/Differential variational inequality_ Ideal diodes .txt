An ideal diode is a diode that conducts electricity in the forward direction with no resistance if a forward voltage is applied, but allows no current to flow in the reverse direction. Then if the reverse voltage is



v
(
t
)


{\displaystyle v(t)}
, and the forward current is



i
(
t
)


{\displaystyle i(t)}
, then there is a complementarity relationship between the two:




0
≤
v
(
t
)

⊥

i
(
t
)
≥
0


{\displaystyle 0\leq v(t)\quad \perp \quad i(t)\geq 0}

for all



t


{\displaystyle t}
. If the diode is in a circuit containing a memory element, such as a capacitor or inductor, then the circuit can be represented as a differential variational inequality.
