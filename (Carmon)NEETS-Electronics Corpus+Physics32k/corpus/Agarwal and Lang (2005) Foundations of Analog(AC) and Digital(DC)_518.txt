By the second step of the Th√©venin method, the resistance RTH is found by measuring
(cid:3)
the resistance of the open-circuit network seen from the aa
port with the independent
voltage source set to zero; that is, with the voltage source replaced with a short circuit.
The network with the voltage source replaced with a short is shown in Figure 3.58.
