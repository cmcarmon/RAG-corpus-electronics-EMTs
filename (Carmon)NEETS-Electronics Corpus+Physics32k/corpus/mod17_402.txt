On the receive side, the rf tone-modulated signals are received at the antenna. You then patch the 
signal via the multicoupler to the receiver section of the transceiver. Demodulation takes place at this 
point. The resulting audio tone-shift signals are then patched through the receiver transfer switchboard. 
The signals now go from the switchboard to the tone terminal set, where they are converted back to dc 
signals. The dc signals are then patched through the communication patching panel to the tty for printing.
