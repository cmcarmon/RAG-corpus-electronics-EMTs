To illustrate these two ideas, consider a scenario whereby a given band of frequencies is somewhat sparsely
occupied  by  a  set  of  conventional  (i.e.,  nonspread)  signals.  To  increase  the  overall  spectral  efÔ¨Åciency  of  the
band, a set of spread spectrum waveforms can be overlaid on the same frequency band, thus forcing the two
sets of users to share common spectrum. Clearly, this scheme is feasible only if the mutual interference that
one set of users imposes on the other is within tolerable limits. Because of the interference suppression properties
