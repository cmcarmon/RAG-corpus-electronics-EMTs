Crustal strain and deformation is the change in shape and volume of continental and oceanic crust caused by stress applied to rock through tectonic forces. An array of variables including composition, temperature, pressure, etc., determines how the crust will deform.
A few questions hoping to be answered by EarthScope include:
How do crust and mantle rheology vary with rock type and with depth?
How does lithospheric rheology change in the vicinity of a fault zone?
What is the distribution of stress in the lithosphere?
