This has been possible by the substitution of the steel core of
the conductor with composite materials, such as carbon ﬁbers
and ﬁberglass. There are claims that this permits a 2- to 3-fold
increase in the electrical power transmitted. This increase is
even more impressive when considering that it can be achieved
without changing the towers. But it remains to be seen at what
cost. Obviously, the new composite conductors are more ex-
pensive than the conventional conductors.
