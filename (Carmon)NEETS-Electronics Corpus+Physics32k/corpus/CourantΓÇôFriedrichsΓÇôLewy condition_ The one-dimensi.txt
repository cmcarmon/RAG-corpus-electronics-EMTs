For one-dimensional case, the CFL has the following form:




C
=



u

Δ
t


Δ
x



≤

C

max




{\displaystyle C={\frac {u\,\Delta t}{\Delta x}}\leq C_{\max }}

where the dimensionless number is called the Courant number,




u


{\displaystyle u}
is the magnitude of the velocity (whose dimension is length/time)




Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
is the time step (whose dimension is time)




Δ
x


{\displaystyle \Delta x}
is the length interval (whose dimension is length).
The value of




C

max




{\displaystyle C_{\max }}
changes with the method used to solve the discretised equation, especially depending on whether the method is explicit or implicit. If an explicit (time-marching) solver is used then typically




C

max


=
1


{\displaystyle C_{\max }=1}
. Implicit (matrix) solvers are usually less sensitive to numerical instability and so larger values of




C

max




{\displaystyle C_{\max }}
may be tolerated.
