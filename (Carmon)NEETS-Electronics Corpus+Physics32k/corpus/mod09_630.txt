An application of Kirchhoff's law shows the relationship between the waveforms across the resistor 
and capacitor in a series network. Since the sum of the voltage drops in a closed loop must equal the total 
applied voltage, the graphical sum of the voltage waveforms in a closed loop must equal the applied 
waveform. Figure 4-39 shows a differentiator circuit with the output taken across a variable resistor.
