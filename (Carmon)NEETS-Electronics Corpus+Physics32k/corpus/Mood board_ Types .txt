Traditionally, mood boards are made from foam board which can be cut up with a scalpel and can also have spray mounted cut-outs put onto it. Creating mood boards in a digital form may be easier and quicker, especially when it comes to collaboration or modification of projects, but physical objects often tend to have a higher impact on people because of the more complete palette of sensations physical mood boards offer, in contrast with the digital mood boards. Mood boards can also be painted.
