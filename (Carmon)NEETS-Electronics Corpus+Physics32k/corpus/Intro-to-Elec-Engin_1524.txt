(15.3.19)
Equation (15.3.18) can be viewed as a carrier Ac cos(ωct + φc) modulated in amplitude by
a digital signal d(t) with amplitudes of 1 when the binary digit in the bit interval is 1 and 0,
respectively. Figure 15.3.16 illustrates the functions of a coherent PSK communication system,
which is similar to the ASK system of Figure 15.3.14 with the following differences:
