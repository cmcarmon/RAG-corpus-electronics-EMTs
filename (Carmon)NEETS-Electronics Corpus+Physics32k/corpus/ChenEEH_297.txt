The noise margins of a CMOS gate can be found by Ô¨Årst
examining the dc transfer curve shown in Figure 2.8. From
graphical analysis, the VIL occurs when the PMOS is in its
linear regime and the NMOS is in its saturation regime. Since a
CMOS gate is complementary in operation, the VIH by sym-
metry occurs when the PMOS is in its saturation regime and
the NMOS is in its linear regime.
