A convenient test for a semiconductor diode requires only an ohmmeter. The back-and-forward
resistance can be measured at a voltage determined by the battery potential of the ohmmeter and the
resistance range at which the meter is set. When the test leads of the ohmmeter are connected to the diode,
a resistance will be measured that is different from the resistance indicated if the leads are reversed. The
smaller value is called the FORWARD RESISTANCE, and the larger value is called the BACK
RESISTANCE. If the ratio of back-to-forward resistance is greater than 10 to 1, the diode should be
capable of functioning as a rectifier. However, keep in mind that this is a very limited test that does not
take into account the action of the diode at voltages of different magnitudes and frequencies. (NOTE:
This test should never be used to test crystal mixer diodes in radars. It will destroy their sensitivity.)
