Finally,  we  often  require  a  symmetrical  square 
wave  output  where  T1 = T2 . To  obtain  such  an 
output, we should make R3 = R4 and C1 = C1, in 
which case the periodic time of the output will be 
given by: 
 
T = 1.4 C R
where C = C1 = C2 and R = R3 = R4. Waveforms 
for the astable oscillator are shown in Fig. 9.8.
