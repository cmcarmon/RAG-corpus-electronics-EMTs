A low-band VHF station can achieve its maximum 100-kW power output through a wide range of transmitter
and antenna combinations. A 35-kW transmitter coupled with a gain-of-4 antenna would work, as would a
10-kW  transmitter  feeding  an  antenna  with  a  gain  of  12.  Reasonable  pairings  for  a  high-band VHF  station
would range from a transmitter with a power output of 50 kW feeding an antenna with a gain of 8, to a 30-kW
transmitter connected to a gain-of-12 antenna. These combinations assume reasonable feedline losses. To reach
the exact power level, minor adjustments are made to the power output of the transmitter, usually by a front
panel power trim control.
