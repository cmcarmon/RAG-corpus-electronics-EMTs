If multiple stimuli are delivered to a single motor-nerve Ô¨Åber with an increasing frequency, the twitches fuse
into a sustained (tetanic) contraction whose force is much more than that of a twitch. This occurs because each
action potential liberates contractile energy. The critical fusion frequency depends on the type of muscle, but
in general it is about 25 to 40 per second.
