2. With a source equaling a complex exponential, all variables in a linear circuit will also be complex
exponentials having the same frequency. The circuit’s only remaining “mystery” is what each variable’s
complex amplitude might be. To ﬁnd these, we consider the source to be a complex number (Vin here)
and the elements to be impedances.
