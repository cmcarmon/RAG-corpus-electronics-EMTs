The resonant frequency can also be determined through the use of a reactance chart developed by the Bell
Telephone  Laboratories  (Fig.  1.21).  This  chart  can  be  used  for  solving  problems  of  inductance,  capacitance,
frequency, and impedance. If two of the values are known, the third and fourth values may be found with its use.
