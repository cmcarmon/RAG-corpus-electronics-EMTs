A magnetic crane used for lifting weights can be modeled and analyzed as a simple magnetic
circuit, as shown in Figure E12.1.1. Its conﬁguration consists of two distinct pieces of the same
magnetic material with two air gaps. Obtain an expression for the total pulling force on the bar
in terms of the ﬂux density B in the air-gap region and the cross-sectional area A perpendicular
to the plane of paper, while making reasonable approximations.
