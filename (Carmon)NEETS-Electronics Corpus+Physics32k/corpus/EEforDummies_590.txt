If you have two multimeters, try measuring the voltage across the LED with 
one multimeter (set to DC volts) and the current flowing through the LED 
with the other multimeter (set to DC amps) simultaneously. You should 
notice that the LED turns on when its voltage approaches 2.0 V, with just 
a tiny current passing through it at this point. As you increase the current 
through the LED, the light brightens but the voltage across it remains fairly 
steady.
