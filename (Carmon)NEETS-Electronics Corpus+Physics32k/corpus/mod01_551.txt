Maximum power is transferred from the source to the load when the resistance of the load is equal to
the internal resistance of the source. This theory is illustrated in the table and the graph of figure 3-36.
When the load resistance is 5 ohms, matching the source resistance, the maximum power of 500 watts is
developed in the load.
