Many  speciﬁc  examples  of  heat  transfer  may  need  to  be  considered  in  board  design,  and  of  course  most
examples involve both conductive and convective transfer. For example, the air gap between the bottom of a
. A  wider  gap  will
standard  SMD  and  the  board  effects  the  thermal  resistance  from  the  case  to  ambient, 
result in a higher resistance, due to poorer convective transfer, whereas ﬁlling the gap with a thermal-conductive
epoxy will lower the resistance by increasing conductive heat transfer. Thermal-modeling software is the best
way to deal with these types of issues, due to the need for rigorous application of computational ﬂuid dynamics
(CFD) [Lee, 1994].
