The waveforms in Figures 10.33b and 10.33e are related in a special way to
those in Figures 10.2b and 10.2c. Note first that the input signal in this problem
is the integral of the input signal in Figure 10.2 (assuming a Th√©venin source).
Now, from Figures 10.33e and 10.2c, or from Equations 10.124 and 10.20, the
output signal here is the integral of the output signal in Figure 10.2,12 again,
assuming that we are dealing with the zero-state response.
