This converter, shown in Figure 6.2.14, also contains a D/A converter, but the binary counter
is replaced by a successive-approximation register (SAR), which makes the analog-to-digital
conversion much faster. The SAR sets the MSB to 1 and all other bits to 0, after a start-of-
conversion pulse. If the comparator indicates the D/A converter output to be larger than the signal
