Now that you have learned about operating systems, let's go into another type of program, utilities. 
In addition to the utility commands (like diskcopy and rename), which are built into the operating system, 
you will probably have some independent utility programs. These are standard programs that run under 
control of the operating system just like your applications programs. They are called utilities because they 
perform general types of functions that have little relationship to the content of the data. Utility programs 
eliminate the need for programmers to write new programs when all they want to do is copy, print, or sort 
a data file. Although a new program is not needed, we do have to tell the program what we want it to do. 
We do this by providing information about files, data fields, and the process to be used. For example, a 
sort program arranges data records in a specified order. You will have to tell the sort program what fields 
to sort on and whether to sort in ascending or descending sequence.
