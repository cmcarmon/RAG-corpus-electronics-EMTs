Under some circumstances, the masses of quarks do not meaningfully contribute to the system's behavior, and can be ignored. The simplified behavior of flavour transformations can then be successfully modeled as acting independently on the left- and right-handed parts of each quark field. This approximate description of the flavour symmetry is described by a chiral group SUL(Nf) Ã— SUR(Nf).
