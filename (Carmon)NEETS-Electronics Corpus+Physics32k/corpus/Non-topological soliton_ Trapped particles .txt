The way NTS's could be born by depends on whether or not the Universe carries a net charge. If it does not then NTS could be formed from random fluctuations of the charge. Those fluctuations grow up, disturb the vacuum and create NTS configurations.
If the net charge is present, i.e. charge asymmetry exists with a parameter

{\displaystyle \eta =(|n_{\Phi }-n_{\overline {\Phi }}|)/(n_{\Phi }+n_{\overline {\Phi }})}
, NTS could be simply born as the space became divided onto finite regions of true and false vacuum during the phase transition in the early Universe. Those occupied by the NTS (false) vacuum are almost ready NTSs. The scenario of the region formation depends on the phase transition order.

If the first order phase transition occurs, then nucleating bubbles of true vacuum grow and percolate, shrinking regions filled with the false vacuum. The later are preferable for charged particles to live in due to their smaller masses, so those regions become NTSs.

In case of the second order phase transition as temperature drops below the crucial value

the space consist of interconnecting regions of both false and true vacua with characteristic size

. This interconnection "freezes out" as its rate becomes smaller than the expansion rate of the Universe at Ginzburg temperature

But if the false vacuum energy is large enough,

on the plot, the false vacuum forms finite clusters (NTS's) surrounded by the percolated true vacuum. The trapped charge stabilizes clusters against collapse.

In the second scenario of the NTS formation the number of born
