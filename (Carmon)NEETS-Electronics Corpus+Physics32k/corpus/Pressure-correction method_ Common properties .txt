Due to the non-linearity of the convective term in the momentum equation that is written above, this problem is solved with a nested-loop approach. While so called global or inner iterations represent the real time-steps and are used to update the variables

, based on a linearized system, and boundary conditions; there is also an outer loop for updating the coefficients of the linearized system.
The outer iterations comprise two steps:
Solve the momentum equation for a provisional velocity based on the velocity and pressure of the previous outer loop.
Plug the new newly obtained velocity into the continuity equation to obtain a correction.
The correction for the velocity that is obtained from the second equation one has with incompressible flow, the non-divergence criterion or continuity equation

, resulting from spurious mass flux, then using this mass imbalance to get a new pressure value. The pressure value that is attempted to compute, is such that when plugged into momentum equations a divergence-free velocity field results. The mass imbalance is often also used for control of the outer loop.
The name of this class of methods stems from the fact that the correction of the velocity field is computed through the pressure-field.
The discretization of this is typically done with either the finite element method or the finite volume method. With the latter, one might also encounter the dual mesh, i.e. the computation grid obtained from connecting the centers of the cells that the initial subdivision into finite elements of the computation domain yielded.
