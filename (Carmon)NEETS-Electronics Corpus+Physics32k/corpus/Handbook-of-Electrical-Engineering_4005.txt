where U is the unilateral power gain, f is the operating frequency, Rds is the drain-source resistance, and Rg is
the gate resistance. As this expression indicates, large power gain requires a high fT, and a large Rds/Rg ratio. The
highest  frequency  at  which  the  device  could  be  expected  to  produce  power  gain  can  be  deﬁned  from  the
frequency, f, at which U goes to zero. This frequency is called the maximum frequency of oscillation, or fmax,
and is deﬁned as
