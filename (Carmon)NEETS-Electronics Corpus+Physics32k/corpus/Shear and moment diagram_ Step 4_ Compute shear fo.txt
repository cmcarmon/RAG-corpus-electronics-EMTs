Taking the second segment, ending anywhere before the second internal force, we have

{\displaystyle \sum M_{A}=R_{a}(10)-(1)(x-10){\frac {(x+10)}{2}}-V_{2}x+M_{2}=0\,.}

{\displaystyle V_{2}=R_{a}-x\quad {\text{and}}\quad M_{2}=-50+R_{a}(x-10)-{\frac {x^{2}}{2}}\,.}

Notice that because the shear force is in terms of x, the moment equation is squared. This is due to the fact that the moment is the integral of the shear force. The tricky part of this moment is the distributed force. Since the force changes with the length of the segment, the force will be multiplied by the distance after 10 ft. i.e. (x-10) the moment location is defined in the middle of the distributed force, which is also changing. This is where (x+10)/2 is derived from.
Alternatively, we can take moments about the cross-section to get

{\displaystyle \sum M_{A}=10x-R_{a}(x-10)+(1)(x-10){\frac {(x-10)}{2}}+M_{2}=0\,.}
