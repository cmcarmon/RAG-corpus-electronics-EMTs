When the analysis of electronic (nonreciprocal) circuits became important in circuit theory, controlled sources
were added to the family of circuit elements. Table 2.1 shows the four types of controlled sources. In this section,
we  will  address  the  questions: What  are  controlled  sources? Why  are  controlled  sources  important?  How  do
controlled sources affect methods of circuit analysis?
