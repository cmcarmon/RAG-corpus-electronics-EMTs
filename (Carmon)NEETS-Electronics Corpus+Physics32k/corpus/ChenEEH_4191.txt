Open System Interconnection (OSI) is an International Stand-
ard Organization (ISO) standard that deﬁnes computer com-
munication network architecture. It is a well-deﬁned network
architecture, but the implementation of its network protocols
is very rare. When its draft standard came out in 1985, many
predicated that the implementation of network protocols would
predominate in the industry. The prediction was incorrect due to
the wide use of Internet protocols in 1985. However, OSI repre-
sents a very powerful network reference model to which all
communication technologies refer their architecture (see Figure
6.1). This also includes the most popular TCP/IP architecture.
