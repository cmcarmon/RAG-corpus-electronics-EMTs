Rotating magnetic fields may be set up in two-phase or three-phase machines. To establish a rotating
magnetic field in a motor stator, the number of pole pairs must be the same as (or a multiple of) the
number of phases in the applied voltage. The poles must then be displaced from each other by an angle
equal to the phase angle between the individual phases of the applied voltage.
