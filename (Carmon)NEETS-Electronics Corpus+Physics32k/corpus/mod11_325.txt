A SLOT ANTENNA exhibits many of the characteristics of a conventional dipole antenna. When 
arranged in arrays, a high degree of directivity can be obtained. Also, the beam can be caused to scan a 
volume of space by changing either the frequency or phase of the energy driving the antenna elements.
