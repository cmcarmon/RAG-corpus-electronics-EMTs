The circuit shown in figure 2-16 produces a positive agc voltage. Transformer T1, diode CR1,
capacitor C1, and resistor R1 comprise a series diode detector. The agc network is made up of R2 and C2.
With normal detector operation and the positive (+) potential shown at the input, CR1 conducts.
Conduction of the diode will cause a charging current (shown by the dashed line) to flow through agc
capacitor C2 and agc resistor R2. This charging current develops a voltage across C2. When the potential
across T1 reverses, the diode will be reverse biased and will not conduct. When this happens, the charging
current ceases and C2 begins to discharge. The discharge path for C2 is shown by the solid arrows. The
