Aviation regulations (such as FAR and EASA) define several different VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls of the aircraft to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (VMCA) is the most important minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and aircraft flight manuals. On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722 kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23.
Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific minimum control speeds, as VMC will change depending on the stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either one or two engines inoperative on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the VMCs that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations and in military specifications.
