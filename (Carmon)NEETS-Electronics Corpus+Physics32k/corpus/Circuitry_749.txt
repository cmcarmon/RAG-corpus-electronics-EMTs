Switches 
 
Switches  can  be  readily  interfaced  to  electronic 
circuits  in  order  to  provide  manual  inputs  to  the 
system. Simple toggle and push-button switches are 
generally  available  with  normally  open  (NO), 
normally closed (NC), or changeover contacts. In 
the  latter  case,  the  switch  may  be  configured  as 
either  an  NO  or  an  NC  type,  depending  upon  the 
connections used.
