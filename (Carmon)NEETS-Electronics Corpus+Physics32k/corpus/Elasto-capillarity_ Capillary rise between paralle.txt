In the case of capillary rise between two parallel plates, height of capillary rise can be predicted as Jurin's height if plates are rigid. Longer the plates, more flexible they become, consequently plates coalesce as a result of deformation induced by capillary force. As observed, length of capillary rise Lwet between elastic plates increases linearly with total length of plates L, sets length of dry Ld=L-Lwet nearly a constant. By balancing gain of surface energy by capillary force and loss of elastic energy by banding a flexible sheet and minimizing with respect to Ld, dry length was found to be:

{\displaystyle L_{EC}=({\frac {B}{\gamma }})^{\frac {1}{2}}}
is the elastocapillary length of sheets
w is the distance between two parallel sheets
This Ld sets the minimum length for parallel sheets to collapse, sheets spontaneously coalesce if they are longer than Ld.
Above result can be generalized to multiple parallel plates when N elastic plates were used. By assuming these N sheets is N times more rigid than single sheet, such system can be treated as two bundles of N/2 sheets with a distance Nw/2. Thus the dry length can be written as:
