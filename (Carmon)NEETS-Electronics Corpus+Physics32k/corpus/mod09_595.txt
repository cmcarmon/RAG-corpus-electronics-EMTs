The sine wave which has the lowest frequency in the complex periodic wave is referred to as the 
FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY. The type and number of harmonics included in the waveform are 
dependent upon the shape of the waveform. Harmonics have two classifications â€” EVEN numbered and 
ODD numbered. Harmonics are always a whole number of times higher than the fundamental frequency 
and are designated by an integer (whole number). For example, the frequency twice as high as the 
fundamental frequency is the SECOND HARMONIC (or the first even harmonic).
