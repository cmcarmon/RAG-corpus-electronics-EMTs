The aural output stage of a television transmitter is similar in basic design to a frequency modulated (FM)
broadcast  transmitter.  Tetrode  output  devices  generally  operate  class C;  solid-state  devices  operate  in  one  of
many possible switching modes for high efÔ¨Åciency. The aural PA for a UHF transmitter may use a klystron,
IOT, MSDC, tetrode, or a group of solid-state power blocks.
