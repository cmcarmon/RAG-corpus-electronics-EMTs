Since 1970, computer simulation software has evolved sub-
stantially, and packages that deal with large-scale systems
either explicitly or implicitly exploit the component con-
nection philosophy. One of the more recent software de-
velopments
large-scale
heterogeneous systems is an object-oriented language called
Modelica; see Mattson et al. (1998) for additional information.
