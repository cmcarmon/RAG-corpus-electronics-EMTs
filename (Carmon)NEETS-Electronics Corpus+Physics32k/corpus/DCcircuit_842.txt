In the early days of industrial instrumentation, compressed air was used as a signaling
medium to convey information from measuring instruments to indicating and controlling de-
vices located remotely. The amount of air pressure corresponded to the magnitude of whatever
variable was being measured. Clean, dry air at approximately 20 pounds per square inch (PSI)
was supplied from an air compressor through tubing to the measuring instrument and was
then regulated by that instrument according to the quantity being measured to produce a cor-
responding output signal. For example, a pneumatic (air signal) level ”transmitter” device set
up to measure height of water (the ”process variable”) in a storage tank would output a low air
pressure when the tank was empty, a medium pressure when the tank was partially full, and
a high pressure when the tank was completely full.
