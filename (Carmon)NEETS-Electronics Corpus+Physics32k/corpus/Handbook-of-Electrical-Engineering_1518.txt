Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR)
The MLLR framework was Ô¨Årst introduced in [27]. Consider the case of a continuous density HMM system
with Gaussian output distributions. A particular Gaussian distribution, g, is characterized by a mean vector,
g, and a covariance matrix Ug. Given a speech vector ot, the probability of that vector being generated by a
Gaussian distribution g is bg(ot):
