One  of  the  most  common  types  of  transducers  generates  electrical  signals  as  a  function  of  the  changing
physical quantity, and one of the most common varieties of this type is the resistance wire strain gauge. In this
transducer, the ability of the wire to change its dimension as it is stressed causes a corresponding change in its
electrical resistance. A decrease in wire diameter generally results in greater resistance to the ï¬‚ow of electricity.
Similarly, temperature-sensitive materials that have electrical characteristics changing with temperature make
temperature detection possible.
