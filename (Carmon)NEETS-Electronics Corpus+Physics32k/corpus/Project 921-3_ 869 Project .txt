After 1986 the Air Ministry starts its 869 Project regarding space plane concepts. Up to 1990, the several space-shuttle proposals studied were:
Tianjiao-1 space shuttle, proposed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology. Totally dependent on the parent rocket booster to reach orbit. 25 ton orbiter, 2 ton payload.
Chang Cheng-1 (Great Wall-1) space shuttle, proposed by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology and 640 Institute of the Air Ministry. 94 ton orbiter launched atop three-parallel HT-1 SLVs to a 200â€“500 km orbit. 5-ton payload and maximum of 5 crew members.
V-2 rocket plane, proposed by the 11th Aeronautics Institute;
H-2 aerospace plane, proposed by Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute. Reusable launch stage weighs 198 tons using dual rocket and ramjet engine for Mach 5+ launch speed. 132 tons orbiter.
