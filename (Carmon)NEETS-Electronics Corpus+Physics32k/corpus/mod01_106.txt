If a hard rubber rod is rubbed with fur to give it a negative charge and is then held against the right-
hand ball in part (A), the rod will give off a negative charge to the ball. The right-hand ball will have a
negative charge with respect to the left-hand ball. When released, the two balls will be drawn together, as
shown in figure 1-6(A). They will touch and remain in contact until the left-hand ball gains a portion of
the negative charge of the right-hand ball, at which time they will swing apart as shown in figure 1-6(C).
If a positive or a negative charge is placed on both balls (fig. 1-6(B)), the balls will repel each other.
