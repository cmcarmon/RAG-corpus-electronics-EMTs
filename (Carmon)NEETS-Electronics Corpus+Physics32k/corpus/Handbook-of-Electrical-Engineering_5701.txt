• maloperation of control devices, main signalling systems, and protective relays
• extra losses in capacitors, transformers, and rotating machines
• additional noise from motors and other apparatus
• telephone interference
• The  presence  of  power  factor  correction  capacitors  and  cable  capacitance  can  cause  shunt  and  series
resonances in the network producing voltage ampliﬁcation even at a remote point from the distorting
load.
