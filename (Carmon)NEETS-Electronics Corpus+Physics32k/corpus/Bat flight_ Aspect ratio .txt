Aspect ratio has been calculated with different definitions. The two methods outlined here give different, non-comparable values. The first method of calculation is the wingspan squared over the area of the wings. Another way to calculate it is by taking the length of the wrist to the tip of the third finger, adding the length of the forearm, and then dividing that total by the distance from the wrist to the fifth finger. Faster flight speed is significantly correlated with higher aspect ratios. Higher aspect ratios decrease the energetic costs of flight, which is beneficial to migratory species.
