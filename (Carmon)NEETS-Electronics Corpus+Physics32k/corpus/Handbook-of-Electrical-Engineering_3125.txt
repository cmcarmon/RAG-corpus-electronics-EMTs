The gate of a MOSFET is isolated electrically from the source by a layer of silicon oxide. The gate draws only
a minute leakage current of the order of nanoamperes. Hence the gate drive circuit is simple and power loss
in the gate control circuit is practically negligible. Although in steady state the gate draws virtually no current,
this is not so under transient conditions. The gate-to-source and gate-to-drain capacitances have to be charged
and discharged appropriately to obtain the desired switching speed, and the drive circuit must have a sufÔ¨Åciently
low output impedance to supply the required charging and discharging currents. The circuit symbol of a power
MOSFET is shown in Fig. 30.5.
