When the field current is decreased, the field flux is reduced, and the counter emf decreases. This 
permits more armature current. Therefore, the motor speeds up. When the field current is increased, the 
field flux is increased. More counter emf is developed, which opposes the armature current. The armature 
current then decreases, and the motor slows down.
