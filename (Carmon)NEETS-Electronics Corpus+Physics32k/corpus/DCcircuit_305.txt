To guard against such an occurrence, it is advisable to only use one hand to work on live
circuits of hazardous voltage, keeping the other hand tucked into a pocket so as to not acci-
dently touch anything. Of course, it is always safer to work on a circuit when it is unpowered,
but this is not always practical or possible. For one-handed work, the right hand is generally
preferred over the left for two reasons: most people are right-handed (thus granting additional
coordination when working), and the heart is usually situated to the left of center in the chest
cavity.
