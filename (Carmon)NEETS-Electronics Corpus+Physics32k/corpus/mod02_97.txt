 Thus the voltages across the inductor and the resistor change in magnitude during the period of 
growth of current the same way the force applied to the boat divides itself between the effects of inertia 
and friction. In both examples, the force is developed first across the inertia/inductive effect and finally 
across the friction/resistive effect.
