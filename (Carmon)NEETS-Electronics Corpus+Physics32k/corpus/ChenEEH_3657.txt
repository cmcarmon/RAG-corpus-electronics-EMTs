Three ‘‘phonetic alphabets’’ are widely used; the two noted
in this paragraph are preferred by most speech engineers. The
International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) was developed by
European phoneticians in the late 19th century, and it remains
the standard for basic science writing on phonetics. The com-
plete IPA has entries covering phonemes in all the world’s
languages (Ladefoged, 1975). To facilitate keyboard entry of
phonetic transcriptions, a more recent phonetic alphabet was
developed under the auspices of the United States Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and is accord-
ingly called the ARPAbet. There are two versions of the
ARPAbet, one that uses single letter symbols and one that
uses all uppercase symbols. The use of all uppercase necessi-
tates some double letter designators. When transcription is
necessary in this discussion, we will employ the single-letter
ARPAbet symbols. In general, phonemic or phonetic transcrip-
tions are shown between two forward slashes as we did when
denoting the phonemes =E= and =s= for Figures 3.2 and 3.3.
