A monochromatic or harmonic plane wave is one which has a single frequency, and thus the variation of amplitude is sinusoidal, represented by a sine or cosine function. A harmonic plane wave traveling to the right along the x-axis can be represented by the equation

)


{\displaystyle A(x,t)=A_{o}\cos(kx-\omega t+\varphi )}

In the above equation:




A
(
x
,
t
)



{\displaystyle A(x,t)\,}
is the magnitude or disturbance of the wave at a given point in space and time. An example would be to let



A
(
x
,

)



{\displaystyle A(x,t)\,}
represent the variation of air pressure relative to the norm in the case of a sound wave.





A

o





{\displaystyle A_{o}\,}
is the amplitude of the wave which is the peak magnitude of the oscillation.




k



{\displaystyle k\,}
is the wave’s wave number, conceptually the radian spatial frequency, or more specifically the angular wave number and equals 2π/λ, where λ is the wavelength of the wave.



k



{\displaystyle k\,}
has the units of radians per unit distance and is a measure of how rapidly the disturbance changes over a given distance at a particular point in time.




x



{\displaystyle x\,}
is a point along the x-axis.



y



{\displaystyle y\,}
and



z



{\displaystyle z\,}
are not part of the equation because the wave's magnitude and phase are the same at every point on any given y-z plane in this example.




ω



{\displaystyle \omega \,}
is the wave’s angular frequency which equals 2π/T, where T is the period of the wave.



ω



{\displaystyle \omega \,}
has the units of radians per unit time and is a measure of how rapidly the disturbance changes over a given length of time at a particular point in space.




t



{\displaystyle t\,}
is a given point in time




φ



{\displaystyle \varphi \,}
is the phase shift of the wave and has the units of radians. A positive phase shift, at a given moment of time, shifts the wave in the negative x-axis direction. A phase shift of 2π radians shifts it exactly one wavelength.
