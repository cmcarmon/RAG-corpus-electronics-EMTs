C1 is  referred  to  as  a  reservoir  capacitor.  It  
stores  charge  during  the  positive  half-cycles  of 
secondary  voltage  and  releases 
the 
negative half-cycles. The circuit of Fig. 6.5 is thus 
able  to  maintain  a  reasonably  constant  output 
voltage across RL. Even so, C1 will discharge by a 
small  amount  during 
the  negative  half-cycle 
periods from the transformer secondary.
