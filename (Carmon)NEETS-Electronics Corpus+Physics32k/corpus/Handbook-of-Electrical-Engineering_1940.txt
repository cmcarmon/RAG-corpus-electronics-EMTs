(a)  A  two-stage  pipelinable  time-invariant  lattice  digital  ﬁlter.  If  multiplication  and  addition  operations
require 2 and 1 time units, respectively, then this data ﬂow graph can achieve a sampling period of 10 time units (which
ﬁ
corresponds to the critical path 
 
). (b) The pipelined/retimed lattice digital ﬁlter
can achieve a sampling period of 2 time units.
