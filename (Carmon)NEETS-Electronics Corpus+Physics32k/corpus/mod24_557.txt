By performing the OTDR attenuation measurement in each direction along the test fiber, test
personnel can eliminate the effects of backscatter variations. Attenuation measurements made in the
opposite direction at the same wavelength (within 5 nm) are averaged to reduce the effect of backscatter
variations. This process is called bidirectional averaging. Bidirectional averaging is possible only if test
personnel have access to both fiber ends. OTDR attenuation values obtained using bidirectional averaging
should compare with those measured using the cutback technique in the laboratory.
