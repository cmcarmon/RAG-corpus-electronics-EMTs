The purpose of artificial ventilation is to force air out of the lungs and into the lungs, in rhythmic
alternation, until natural breathing is reestablished. Artificial ventilation should be given only when
natural breathing has stopped; it should NOT be given to any person who is breathing naturally. You
should not assume that an individual who is unconscious due to electrical shock has stopped breathing. To
tell if someone suffering from an electrical shock is breathing, place your hands on the personâ€™s sides, at
the level of the lowest ribs. If the victim is breathing, you will usually be able to feel the movement.
Remember: DO NOT GIVE ARTIFICIAL VENTILATION TO A PERSON WHO IS BREATHING
NATURALLY.
