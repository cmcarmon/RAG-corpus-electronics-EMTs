The magnetic flux density (magnetic field) having the unit Wb/m2 (Tesla) is denoted by B, and magnetic flux is defined analogously:

{\displaystyle \oint _{C}\mathbf {E} \cdot d{\boldsymbol {\ell }}=-\int _{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf {B}  \over \partial t}\cdot {\rm {d}}\mathbf {s} =-{\frac {{\rm {d}}\Phi _{B}}{{\rm {d}}t}}}

where dℓ is an infinitesimal vector line element of the closed curve C, with magnitude equal to the length of the infinitesimal line element, and direction given by the tangent to the curve C, with the sign determined by the integration direction.
The time-rate of change of the magnetic flux through a loop of wire is minus the electromotive force created in that wire. The direction is such that if current is allowed to pass through the wire, the electromotive force will cause a current which "opposes" the change in magnetic field by itself producing a magnetic field opposite to the change. This is the basis for inductors and many electric generators.
