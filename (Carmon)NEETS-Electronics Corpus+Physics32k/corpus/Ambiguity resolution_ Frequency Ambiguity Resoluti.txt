The received signals are also compared using the frequency ambiguity resolution process.
A blind velocity occurs when Doppler frequency falls close to the PRF. This folds the return signal into the same filter as stationary clutter reflections. Rapidly alternating different PRF while scanning eliminates blind frequencies.
