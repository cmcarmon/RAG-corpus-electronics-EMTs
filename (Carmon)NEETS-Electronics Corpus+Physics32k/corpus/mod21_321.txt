In using a Kelvin bridge, you must follow precautions similar to those given for the Wheatstone 
bridge. A rheostat is usually placed in series with the battery so that bridge current can be conveniently 
limited to the maximum current allowable. This value of current, which affects the sensitivity of the 
bridge, is determined by the largest amount of heat that can be sustained by the bridge resistances without 
causing a change in their values. All connections must be firm and electrically perfect so that contact 
resistances are held to a minimum. The use of point and knife-edge clamps is recommended. 
Commercially manufactured Kelvin bridges have accuracies of approximately 2% for resistance ranges 
from 0.001 ohm to 25 ohms.
