The series regulator is more popular than the shunt 
regulator. The simplest series regulator is a  variable 
 resistor in series with the load (Figure 36-22). The 
 resistance is adjusted continuously to maintain a 
 constant voltage across the load. When the DC  voltage 
increases, the resistance increases, dropping more 
 voltage. This maintains the voltage drop across the load 
by dropping the extra voltage across the series resistor.
