Electrodynamic
Electrodynamic transducers exploit the forces produced on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic ﬁeld
and,  conversely,  the  currents  produced  by  a  conductor  moving  in  a  magnetic  ﬁeld.  Direct  radiation  moving
coil  transducers  dominate  the  loudspeaker  ﬁeld.  Prototypes  of  high-power  underwater  projectors  have  been
constructed using superconducting magnets. Electrodynamic microphones, particularly the directional ribbon
microphones, are also common.
