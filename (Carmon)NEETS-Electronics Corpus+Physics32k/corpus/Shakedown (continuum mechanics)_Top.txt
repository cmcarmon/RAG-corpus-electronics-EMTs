In continuum mechanics, elastic shakedown behavior is one in which plastic deformation takes place during running in, while due to residual stresses or strain hardening the steady state is perfectly elastic.
Plastic shakedown behavior is one in which the steady state is a closed elastic-plastic loop, with no net accumulation of plastic deformation.
Ratcheting behavior is one in which the steady state is an open elastic-plastic loop, with the material accumulating a net strain during each cycle.
Shakedown concept can be applied to solid metallic materials under cyclic repeated loading or to granular materials under cyclic loading (such case can occur in road pavements under traffic loading).
