The potential difference between the ionosphere and the Earth is maintained by thunderstorms. In the Earth-ionosphere cavity, the electric field and conduction current in the lower atmosphere are primarily controlled by ions.
The Schumann resonance is a set of spectrum peaks in the extremely low frequency (ELF) portion of the Earth's electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonance is due to the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acting as a waveguide. The limited dimensions of the earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves. The cavity is naturally excited by energy from lightning strikes.
