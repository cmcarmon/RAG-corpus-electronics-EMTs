In a P-channel JFET, the channel is made of P-type material and the gate of N-type material. In 
figure 3-46, schematic symbols for the two types of JFET are compared with those of the NPN and PNP 
bipolar transistors. Like the bipolar transistor types, the two types of JFET differ only in the configuration 
of bias voltages required and in the direction of the arrow within the symbol. Just as it does in transistor 
symbols, the arrow in a JFET symbol always points towards the N-type material. Thus the symbol of the 
N-channel JFET shows the arrow pointing toward the drain/source channel, whereas the P-channel 
symbol shows the arrow pointing away from the drain/source channel toward the gate.
