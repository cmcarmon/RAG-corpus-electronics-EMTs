voltage-transfer characteristic (vout versus vin) is plotted in Figure 9.3.1(c). By choosing the low
range to be 0 to 3 V (i.e., less than the threshold voltage) and the high range to be 5 to 7 V, we can
see that any input voltage in the low range gives an output of 7 V (high) and inputs in the high
range give outputs in the low range. Thus, the circuit is seen to be an inverter.
