A magnetic tape recorder’s harmonic-distortion specification is very important. It usually determines
where the record level of a recorder’s electronics should be set. The record level is also used to determine
the signal-to-noise ratio and frequency-response specifications. A typical harmonic-distortion
specification might read "1% third harmonic of a 100-kHz signal at 60 ips." This means that the magnetic
tape recorder has 1% third-harmonic distortion of a 100-kHz signal at 60 ips.
