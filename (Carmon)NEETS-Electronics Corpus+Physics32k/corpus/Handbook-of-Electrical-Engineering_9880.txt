At frequencies where both the minor-loop gain transfer and the major-loop gain are small we have Z(s)/D(s)
Â» 1, and over this range of frequencies neither minor-loop compensation nor series equalization is useful in
reducing the effect of a load disturbance. Thus, we have shown here that there are quite a number of advantages
to minor-loop compensation as compared to series equalization. Of course, there are limitations as well.
