Example 2.14 
 
A resistance of 50 $ rated at 2 W is required. What 
parallel  combination  of  preferred  value  resistors 
will  satisfy  this  requirement?  What  power  rating 
should each resistor have? 
 
Solution 
 
Two  100  $ resistors  may  be  wired  in  parallel  to 
provide a resistance of 50 $ as shown below:
