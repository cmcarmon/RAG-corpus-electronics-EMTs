Electronic circuit simulation programs include 
 National Instrument’s Multisim and New Wave Con-
cepts’ Circuit Wizard. These programs not only enable  
the user to create a schematic diagram but can simu-
late current through the circuit and allow the user 
to troubleshoot on the computer, using virtual	test	
equipment. Additionally, the computer program 
Circuit Wizard shows animated current flow through-
out the circuit represented by the schematic diagram.
