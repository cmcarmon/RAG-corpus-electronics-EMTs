The local-area network (LAN) is a communication network that interconnects computers and computer-based
devices,  such  as  ﬁle  servers,  printers,  and  graphics  terminals.  The  LAN  is  characterized  as  being  contained
completely  within  the  premises  of  a  single  business  entity—which  almost  always  owns  and  operates  the
network—and this distinguishes the LAN from public-domain networks such as metropolitan- or wide-area
networks. The LAN, then, is normally restricted to a few hundred stations (i.e., devices that attach directly to
the LAN) that span a limited geographical area, so that no two connected stations are separated by a distance
of more than a few kilometers. Moreover, the LAN can be distinguished from the computer or backplane bus,
which  interconnects  components,  boards,  or  devices  that  comprise  a  single  computer.  The  LAN  uses
serial—rather than parallel—transmission, which also differentiates it from the computer bus. In contrast to
today’s wide-area networks, information is transmitted over LANs at high speeds and with very low error rates.
The LAN often employs fully broadcast media, or physical media that allow each station’s transmissions to
be received by all other stations. Thus, a broadcast capability is often an integral feature of the LAN. Frequently,
the LAN also provides for multicasting, a generalization of broadcasting in which a speciﬁed subset of stations
receives a transmission.
