the waveguide, it is reﬂected from the sides of the waveguide
whenever it hits them. These various reﬂected waves interact
with each other to produce an inﬁnite number of discrete
characteristic patterns called modes. The existence of a discrete
mode depends on the shape of and size of the waveguide,
the medium in the waveguide, and the operating frequency.
Unlike the TEM, which can be excited at any frequency, the
transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) modes
can only propagate when the wave frequency is higher than a
certain frequency, called the cutoff frequency. The cutoff fre-
quency is different
for each mode. When the operating
frequency of the wave is lower than the cutoff frequency of
the lowest mode, the wave experiences exponential attenuation
and disappears after traveling a very short distance. On the
other hand, those modes with cutoff frequencies lower than
the operating frequency can exist simultaneously inside the
waveguide. To avoid existence of multiple modes, the wave-
guide is operated at a frequency that lies between the cutoff
frequencies of the lowest and the next lowest modes. Guided
waves can have different shapes and be made for different
materials, such as metal or dielectrics or a combination of
them. The shape and the type of waveguide used in a speciﬁc
application depends on the desired performance, geometrical
constraint, and cost.
