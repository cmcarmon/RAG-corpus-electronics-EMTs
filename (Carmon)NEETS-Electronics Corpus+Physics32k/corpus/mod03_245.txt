VOLTMETERS are used to measure voltage. They are always connected in parallel with the circuit
being measured. A voltmeter should have a high resistance compared to the circuit being measured to
minimize the loading effect. Since the resistance of a meter movement is constant, a voltmeter can be
made from a current-sensitive meter movement by the use of range resistors and an appropriate scale.
Voltmeter sensitivity is expressed in ohms per volt.
