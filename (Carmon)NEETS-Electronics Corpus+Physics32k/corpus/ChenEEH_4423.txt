For LTI systems, the state-space characterization of positive
real (PR) conditions results in the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov
(KYP) lemma. In Lozano-Leal and Joshi (1990), the KYP
lemma was extended to WSPR systems, in Joshi and Gupta
(1996), it was extended to MSPR systems. These extensions are
given next.
Let (A, B, C, D) denote an nth-order minimal realization of
the p  p transfer function matrix G(s). The following lemma
then gives the state-space characterization of WSPR system.
The Lozano-Leal and Joshi (1990) Lemma: The G(s) is
WSPR if and only if there exist real matrices: P Â¼ PT > 0,
P 2 Rnn, L 2 Rpn, and W 2 Rpp, such that:
