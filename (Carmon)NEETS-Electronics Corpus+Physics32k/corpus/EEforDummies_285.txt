The word potentiometer is often used to cat­
egorize all variable resistors, but another type 
of variable resistor, known as a rheostat, is 
different from a true potentiometer. Rheostats 
are two‐terminal devices, with one lead con­
nected to the wiper and the other lead con­
nected  to  one  end  of  the  resistance  track. 
Although a potentiometer is a three‐terminal 
device — its leads connect to the wiper and 
to both ends of the resistance track — you 
can use a potentiometer as a rheostat (as is 
quite common) by connecting only two of its 
leads, or you can connect all three leads in
