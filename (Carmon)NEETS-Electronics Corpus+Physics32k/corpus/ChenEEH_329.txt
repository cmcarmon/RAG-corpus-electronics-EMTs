The parameter S in the above equation is the MOSFET sub-
threshold swing, which is one of the most critical performance
Ô¨Ågures of MOSFETs in logic applications. It is highly desirable
to have a subthreshold swing as small as possible since this is
the parameter that determines the amount of voltage swing
necessary to switch a MOSFET from its off state to its on state.
This is especially important for modern MOSFETs with supply
voltages approaching 1.0 V.
