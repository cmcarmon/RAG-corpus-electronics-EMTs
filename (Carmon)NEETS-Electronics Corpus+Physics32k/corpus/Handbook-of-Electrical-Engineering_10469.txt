A key feature of TELEGRIP is a video overlay option that utilizes video to calibrate 3D computer models
with the actual environment. The video overlay technique is especially useful for on-line planning applica-
tions or teleoperations in remote, hazardous, or complex environments such as space, undersea, or nuclear
sites.
