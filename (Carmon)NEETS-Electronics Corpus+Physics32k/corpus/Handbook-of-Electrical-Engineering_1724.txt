. Image enhancement is the ad hoc application of various
processing algorithms to enhance the appearance of the image. Image restoration is the application of algorithms that use
knowledge of the degradation process to enhance or restore the image, i.e., deconvolution algorithms used to remove the
effect of the aperture point spread function in blurred images. A discussion of image restoration is beyond the scope of this
section.
