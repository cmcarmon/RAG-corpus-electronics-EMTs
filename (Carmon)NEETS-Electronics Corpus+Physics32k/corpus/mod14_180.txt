Computers and microprocessors both operate on a series of electrical pulses called words. A word
can be represented by a binary number such as 101100112. The word length is described by the number of
digits or BITS in the series. A series of four digits would be called a 4-bit word and so forth. The most
common are 4-, 8-, and 16-bit words. Quite often, these words must use binary-coded decimal inputs.
