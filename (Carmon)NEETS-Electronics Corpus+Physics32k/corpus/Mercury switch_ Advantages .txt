Mercury switches offer several advantages over other switch types:
The contacts are enclosed, so oxidation of the contact points is unlikely.
In hazardous locations, interrupting the circuit does not emit a spark that could ignite flammable gases.
Contacts stay clean, and even if an internal arc occurs, the contact surfaces renew on every operation, so they don't wear out.
Even a small drop of mercury has low resistance, so switches can carry useful amounts of current in a small size.
Sensitivity of the drop to gravity provides a unique sensing function, and lends itself to simple, low-force mechanisms for manual or automatic operation.
The switches are quiet, as no contacts abruptly snap together.
The mass of the moving mercury drop provides an over center effect to avoid chattering as the switch tilts.
The envelope can include contacts for two or more circuits.
