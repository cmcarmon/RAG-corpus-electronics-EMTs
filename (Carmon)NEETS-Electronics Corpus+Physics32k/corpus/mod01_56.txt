If there are roots to western science, they no doubt lie under the rubble that was once ancient Greece.
With the exception of the Greeks, ancient people had little interest in the structure of materials. They
accepted a solid as being just that a continuous, uninterrupted substance. One Greek school of thought
believed that if a piece of matter, such as copper, were subdivided, it could be done indefinitely and still
only that material would be found. Others reasoned that there must be a limit to the number of
subdivisions that could be made and have the material still retain its original characteristics. They held
fast to the idea that there must be a basic particle upon which all substances are built. Recent experiments
have revealed that there are, indeed, several basic particles, or building blocks within all substances.
