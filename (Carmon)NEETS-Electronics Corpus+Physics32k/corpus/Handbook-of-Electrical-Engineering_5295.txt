Hydro
Hydropower 
is a mature but neglected and one of the most promising renewable energy technologies. In the
context of DG, small (less than 15 MW), mini (less than 1 MW), and micro (less than 100 kW) hydroelectric
plants are of interest. The source of hydropower is the hydrologic cycle driven by the energy from the sun. Most
of the sites for DG hydro are either low-head (2 to 20 m) or medium-head (20 to 150 m). The global hydroelectric
potential is vast. One estimate puts it at 31 GW for Indonesia alone! The installed capacity of small hydro in
the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China was exceeding 7 GW by 1980.
