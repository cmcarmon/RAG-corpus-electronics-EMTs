g) When transmitting information over a noisy wire, buffers can be used to minimize
transmission errors by restoring signal values. Consider
the transmission of data
over a noisy wire that picks up a maximum of 80 mV symmetric peak-to-peak noise
per centimeter. How many buffers are needed to transmit a signal over a distance
of 2 meters in this noisy environment?
