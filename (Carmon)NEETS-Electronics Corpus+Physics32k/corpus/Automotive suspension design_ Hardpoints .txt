The hardpoints control the static settings and the kinematics of the suspension.
The static settings are
Toe
Camber
Caster
Roll center height at design load
Mechanical (or caster) trail
Anti-dive and anti-squat
Kingpin Inclination
Scrub radius
Spring and shock absorber motion ratios
The kinematics describe how important characteristics change as the suspension moves, typically in roll or steer. They include
Bump Steer
Roll Steer
Tractive Force Steer
Brake Force Steer
Camber gain in roll
Caster gain in roll
Roll centre height gain
Ackermann change with steering angle
Track gain in roll
The analysis for these parameters can be done graphically, or by CAD, or by the use of kinematics software.
