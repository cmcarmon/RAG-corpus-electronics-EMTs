Different objective clock schedule modiﬁcation
strategies can be used. The most effective strategy to
modify the objective clock schedule—resulting in the
fastest convergence toward a feasible schedule—is as
follows. All objective clock skews are slightly increased
or decreased depending on whether the respective cal-
culated clock skew is larger or smaller than the object-
ive one. Using this strategy, a feasible solution is
typically reached within a few iterations.
