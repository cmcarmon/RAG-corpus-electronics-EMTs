In any maintenance training program, one of your most important tasks is to learn the use of test
equipment in all types of maintenance work. To be effective in maintenance work, you must become
familiar not only with the common types of measuring instruments, but also with the more specialized
equipment. Some examples of common types of typical measuring instruments are the ammeter,
voltmeter, and ohmmeter; examples of specialized test equipment are the spectrum analyzer, dual-trace
oscilloscope, and power and frequency meters.
