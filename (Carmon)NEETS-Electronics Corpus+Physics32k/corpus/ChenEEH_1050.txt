Glitch Avoidance and Local Transformations
Spurious switching, as mentioned before, is due to the exis-
tence of unequal paths to outputs. Path equalization tech-
niques help in reducing these glitches, consequently resulting
in less power dissipation. Other logic-level power minimiza-
tion techniques involve local transformations, including refac-
toring, remapping, phase assignment, and pin swapping. All
the material in this section is from Benini et al. (2001). All
these techniques can be classiÔ¨Åed as local transformations.
They are applied on gate net-lists and focus on nets with
large switching capacitance. Most of these techniques replace
a gate or a small group of gates around the target net in an
effort to reduce capacitance and switching activity. Similarly to
resizing, local transformations must carefully balance short
circuit and output power consumption.
