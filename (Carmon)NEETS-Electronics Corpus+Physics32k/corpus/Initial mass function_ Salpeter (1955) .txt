The IMF of stars more massive than our sun was first quantified by Edwin Salpeter in 1955. His work favoured an exponent of



α
=
2.35


{\displaystyle \alpha =2.35}
. This form of the IMF is called the Salpeter function or a Salpeter IMF. It shows that the number of stars in each mass range decreases rapidly with increasing mass. The Salpeter Initial Mass Function is

is a constant relating to the local stellar density.
