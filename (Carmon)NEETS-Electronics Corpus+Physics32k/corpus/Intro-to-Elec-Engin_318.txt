Find the angular frequency at which H(ω) is 0 dB
and the angular frequency at which θ (ω) = −60°.
*3.4.12 The loop gain of an elementary feedback control
system (see Figure 3.4.12) is given by G(s)·H (s),
which is 10/(1+ s/2)(1+ s/6)(1+ s/50). Sketch
the asymptotic Bode plot of the loop-gain function.
Gain margin (GM) is deﬁned by [−20 log| ¯G(ωπ )
¯H (ωπ )|], which is the negative of the magnitude
of the loop gain at ω = ωπ , ωπ represents the
angular frequency at which the loop gain reaches
a phase of −π. If ωu represents the value of ω
