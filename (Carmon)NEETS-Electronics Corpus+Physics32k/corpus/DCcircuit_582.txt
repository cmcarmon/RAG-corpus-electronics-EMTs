If we are able to identify which parts of the circuit are series and which parts are parallel,
we can analyze it in stages, approaching each part one at a time, using the appropriate rules
to determine the relationships of voltage, current, and resistance. The rest of this chapter will
be devoted to showing you techniques for doing this.
