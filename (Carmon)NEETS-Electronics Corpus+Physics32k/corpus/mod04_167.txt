A time-controlled resistance soldering set (figure 2-32) is now used at many maintenance activities. 
The set consists of a transformer that supplies 3 or 6 volts at a high current to stainless steel or carbon 
tips. The transformer is turned ON by a foot switch and OFF by an electronic timer. The timer can be 
adjusted for as long as 3 seconds soldering time. This set is especially useful for soldering cables to plugs 
and similar connectors; even the smallest types.
