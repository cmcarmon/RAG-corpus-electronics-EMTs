You probably have noticed by now that feedback has not been mentioned in this discussion. 
Remember that regenerative feedback was a requirement for sustained oscillations. In the case of the 
pulsed oscillator, oscillations are only required for a very short period of time. You should understand, 
however, that as the width of the input gate (which cuts off the transistor) is increased, the amplitude of 
the sine wave begins to decrease (dampen) near the end of the gate period because of the lack of 
feedback. If a long period of oscillation is required for a particular application, a pulsed oscillator with 
regenerative feedback is used. The principle of operation remains the same except that the feedback 
network sustains the oscillation period for the desired amount of time.
