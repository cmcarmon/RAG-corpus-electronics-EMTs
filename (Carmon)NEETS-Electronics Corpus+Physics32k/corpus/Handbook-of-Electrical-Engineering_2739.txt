Primary Steps of VLSI ASIC Design
The VLSI IC design process consists of a sequence of well-deﬁned steps [Preas and Lorenzetti, 1988; Hill et al.,
1989; DeMicheli, 1994a and b] related to the deﬁnition of the functions to be designed; organization of the
circuit blocks implementing these logic functions within the area of the IC; veriﬁcation and simulation at several
stages of design (e.g., behavioral simulation, gate-level simulation, circuit simulation [White and Sangiovanni-
Vincentelli,  1987;  Lee  et  al.,  1993],  etc.);  routing  of  physical  interconnections  among  the  blocks,  and  ﬁnal
detailed placement and transistor-level layout of the VLSI circuit. This process can also be used hierarchically
to design one of the blocks making up the overall IC, representing that circuit block in terms of simpler blocks.
This establishes the “top-down” hierarchical approach, extendable to successively lower-level elements of the
overall design.
