While ECL is not compatible with any other logic family, interfacing buffers, called translators, are available.
In particular, the 10124 converts TTL output levels to ECL complementary levels, and the 10125 converts either
single-ended  or  differential  ECL  outputs  to  TTL  levels.  Among  other  applications  of  these  translators,  they
allow the use of ECL for the highest speed requirements of a system while the rest of the system uses the more
rugged TTL. Another translator is the 10177, which converts the ECL output levels to n-channel metal-oxide
semiconductor (NMOS) levels. This is designed for interfacing ECL with n-channel memory systems.
