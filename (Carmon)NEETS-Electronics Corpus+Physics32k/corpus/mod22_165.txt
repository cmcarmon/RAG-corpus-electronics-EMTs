The storage capacity of a disk depends on the bits per inch of track and the tracks per inch of surface. 
Using Winchester technology, the designers of disk drive units were able to increase the data density of a 
disk by increasing the number of tracks. Winchester was the code name used by IBM during the 
development of this technology. The designers originally planned to use dual disk drives to introduce the 
new concept. Each drive was to have a storage capacity of 30 million characters, and thus was expected to 
be a "30-30." Since that was the caliber of a famous rifle, the new product was nicknamed "Winchester." 
The designers found that data density could be improved and storage capacity increased by reducing the 
flying height, the distance of the read/write heads over the disk surfaces when reading and writing. By 
doing this, smaller magnetized spots could be precisely written and then read. The read/write heads were 
moved so close to the disk that a human hair looked like a mountain in the path of the flying head. 
Winchester technology reduces this potential problem by sealing the disks in a contamination-free 
container. This eliminates foreign objects from coming in contact with the read/write heads.
