The same result can also be obtained by differentiating Equation (13.2.12) with respect to S, or,
(cid:7)
2/S, and setting the result equal to zero. This calculation has
more conveniently, with respect to R
been left to the enterprising student. The slip corresponding to maximum torque Smax T is thus
given by
