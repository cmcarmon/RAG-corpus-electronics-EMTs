Each time a radar transmitter generates an rf pulse, it produces electromagnetic energy. You should 
recall from your study of NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles, that the square wave used to 
modulate the transmitter carrier wave has (1) the fundamental square-wave frequency and (2) an infinite 
number of odd harmonics of the fundamental square wave frequency. When this square wave is used to 
modulate the transmitter carrier frequency, both the fundamental and odd harmonic frequencies of the 
square wave heterodyne with the transmitter carrier frequency. The heterodyning process produces in 
each transmitted rf pulse the following frequencies:
