diode D1 is positive, and the anode of diode D2 is nega-
tive. Diode D1 is forward biased and conducts current, 
whereas diode D2 is reverse biased and does not con-
duct current. The current flows from the center tap of 
the transformer, through the load and diode D1, to the 
top of the secondary of the transformer. This permits 
the positive half of the cycle to be felt across the load. 
Figure 36-10 shows the full-wave rectifier dur-
ing the negative half of the cycle. The anode of diode 
D2 becomes positive, and the anode of diode D1 be-
comes negative. Diode D2 is now forward biased and 
conducts. Diode D1 is reverse-biased and does not 
conduct. The current flows from the center tap of the 
transformer, through the load and diode D2, to the 
bottom of the secondary of the transformer.
