Insulation Resistance
Insulation resistance is the resistance of the dielectric material and determines the time a capacitor, once charged,
will hold its charge. A discharged capacitor has a low insulation resistance; however once charged to its rated
value, it increases to megohms. The leakage in electrolytic capacitors should not exceed
