The five‑digit numbering system is similar to the 
three‑ and four‑digit systems. The first four digits 
 represent significant digits, and the last digit indicates 
the number of zeros to be added. For values of less than 
1000 ohms, the R is used to designate a decimal point.
Surface‑mount resistors are identified similar to 
the letter‑and‑number system. The part number of 
the  resistor is interpreted as follows; the number varies 
 between manufacturers. For example, RC0402J103T 
has the following meaning:
 Chip resistor
 Size (0. 04" 3 0.02")
 Tolerance (J 5 65%, F 5 61%, 
D 5 60.5%, B 5 60.1%)
 Resistance (three‑ or four‑digit code available)
