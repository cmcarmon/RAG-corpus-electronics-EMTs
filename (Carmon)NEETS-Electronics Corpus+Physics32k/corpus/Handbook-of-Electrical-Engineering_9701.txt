For many computer systems it is possible to deﬁne a 
 (MTTR). This will be a function of
a  number  of  things,  including  the  time  taken  to  detect  the  failure,  the  time  taken  to  isolate  and  replace  the
faulty component, and the time taken to verify that the system is operating correctly again. While the MTTF
is a function of the system design and the operating environment, the MTTR is often a function of unpredictable
human factors and, hence, is difﬁcult to quantify. Figures used for MTTR for a given system in a ﬁxed situation
could  be  predictions  based  on  the  experience  of  the  reliability  engineers  or  could  be  simply  the  maximum
response  time  given  in  the  maintenance  contract  for  a  computer.  In  either  case,  MTTR  predictions  may  be
subject to some ﬂuctuations. To take an extreme example, if the service engineer has a ﬂat tire while on the
way to effect the repair, then the repair time may be many times the predicted MTTR. For some systems no
MTTR can be predicted, as they are in situations that make repair impossible or uneconomic. Computers in
satellites are a good example. In these cases and all others where no errors in the output can be allowed, fault
tolerant approaches must be used in order to extend the MTTF beyond the desired system operational lifetime.
