Problem 3.30: Black-Box Circuit
You are given the circuit shown in Figure 3.70 that has two terminals for attaching circuit elements.
When you attach a voltage source equaling sin (t) to the terminals, the current through the source equals
4 sin (t + π/4) − 2 sin (4t). When no source is attached (open-circuited terminals), the voltage across the
terminals has the form A sin (4t + φ).
