The reversal potential (or equilibrium potential) of an ion is the value of transmembrane voltage at which diffusive and electrical forces counterbalance, so that there is no net ion flow across the membrane. This means that the transmembrane voltage exactly opposes the force of diffusion of the ion, such that the net current of the ion across the membrane is zero and unchanging. The reversal potential is important because it gives the voltage that acts on channels permeable to that ion—in other words, it gives the voltage that the ion concentration gradient generates when it acts as a battery.
The equilibrium potential of a particular ion is usually designated by the notation Eion.The equilibrium potential for any ion can be calculated using the Nernst equation. For example, reversal potential for potassium ions will be as follows:

{\displaystyle E_{eq,K^{+}}={\frac {RT}{zF}}\ln {\frac {[K^{+}]_{o}}{[K^{+}]_{i}}},}

where
Eeq,K+ is the equilibrium potential for potassium, measured in volts
R is the universal gas constant, equal to 8.314 joules·K−1·mol−1
T is the absolute temperature, measured in kelvins (= K = degrees Celsius + 273.15)
z is the number of elementary charges of the ion in question involved in the reaction
F is the Faraday constant, equal to 96,485 coulombs·mol−1 or J·V−1·mol−1
[K+]o is the extracellular concentration of potassium, measured in mol·m−3 or mmol·l−1
[K+]i is the intracellular concentration of potassium
Even if two different ions have the same charge (i.e., K+ and Na+), they can still have very different equilibrium potentials, provided their outside and/or inside concentrations differ. Take, for example, the equilibrium potentials of potassium and sodium in neurons. The potassium equilibrium potential EK is −84 mV with 5 mM potassium outside and 140 mM inside. On the other hand, the sodium equilibrium potential, ENa, is approximately +66 mV with approximately 12 mM sodium inside and 140 mM outside.
