Note that formally, the Lagrange multipliers l are not
required for the solution of problem QP-3 because the objec-
tive of the procedures described here is to determine a feasible
clock schedule s. Since the existence and uniqueness of a clock
schedule ^ss satisfying problem QP-3 have been established in
Section 4.4.3, this clock schedule can be directly computed by
evaluating the rightmost expression in equation 4.64:
