As previously stated, a high reverse-bias voltage 
 applied to a diode may create a high reverse current, 
which can generate excessive heat and cause a diode 
to break down. The applied reverse voltage at which 
the breakdown occurs is called the breakdown	
voltage	(eZ) or peak	reverse	voltage. A special 
diode called a zener	diode is connected to operate 
in the reverse-bias mode. It is designed to operate at 
those voltages that exceed the breakdown voltage. This 
breakdown region is called the zener	region.
