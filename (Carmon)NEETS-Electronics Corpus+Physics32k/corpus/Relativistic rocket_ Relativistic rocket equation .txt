As with the classical rocket equation, one wants to calculate the velocity change



Î”
v


{\displaystyle \Delta v}
that a rocket can achieve depending on the specific impulse




I

s
p




{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
and the mass ratio, i. e. the ratio of starting mass




m

0




{\displaystyle m_{0}}
and mass at the end of the acceleration phase (dry mass)




m

1




{\displaystyle m_{1}}
. Subsequently, specific impulse means the momentum produced by the exhaust of a small amount of rocket fuel divided by the mass of that small amount of rocket fuel, in an inertial reference frame where the rocket is at rest before using that small amount of fuel. Thus specific impulse is a velocity, as opposed to the common usage of the word as the ratio of momentum and weight (weight would not make much sense in this context).
