A push–pull amplifier that does not require a 
phase splitter is called a complementary push–
pull   amplifier. It uses an NPN transistor and a 
PNP transistor to accomplish the push–pull action 
 (Figure  38-9). The two transistors are connected in 
 series with their emitters together. When each tran-
sistor is properly biased, there is 0.7 volt between the
