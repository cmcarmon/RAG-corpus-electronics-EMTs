A passenger train from Mansoura passed a red signal and crashed into a stationary train that had come from Benha. Four passenger cars derailed in the accident, which closed the line in the country's Nile Delta region. The train was estimated to have been travelling at more than 50 mph (80 km/h) at the time of the collision. The driver of the Mansoura service was amongst the dead.
