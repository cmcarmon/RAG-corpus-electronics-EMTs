Gaudi's analogue method includes the main features of a computational of a parametric model (input parameters, equation, output):
The string length, birdshot weight and anchor point location all form independent input parameters
The vertex locations of the points on the strings being the outcomes of the model
The outcomes are derived by explicit functions, in this case gravity or Newtons law of motion.
By modifying individual parameters of these models Gaudi could generate different versions of his model while being certain the resulting structure would stand in pure compression. Instead of having to manually calculate the results of parametric equations he could automatically derive the shape of the catenary curves through the force of gravity acting on the strings.
