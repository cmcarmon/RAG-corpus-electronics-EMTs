Time-triggered architecture (abbreviated as TTA), also known as a time-triggered system, is a computer system that executes one or more sets of tasks according to a pre-determined task schedule. Implementation of a TT system will typically involve use of a single interrupt that is linked to the periodic overflow of a timer. This interrupt may drive a task scheduler (a restricted form of real-time operating system). The scheduler will‍—‌in turn‍—‌release the system tasks at predetermined points in time.
