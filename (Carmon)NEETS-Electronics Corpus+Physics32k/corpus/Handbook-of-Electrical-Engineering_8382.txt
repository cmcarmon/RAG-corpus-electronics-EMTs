since the organization of a computer memory bears little resemblance to what we know of the organization of
the human brain. For economic reasons, computer memories have been organized as a hierarchy of different
technologies, with decreasing cost per bit as well as increased access times as one moves away from the central
processor. The introduction of virtual memory in the Manchester Atlas project (c. 1964) was a major break-
through in removing memory management from the tasks of the programmer, but recently the availability of
vast quantities of semiconductor memory at ultralow prices has reduced the need for this technique.
