Variable Length Coding
The most well-known and widely used variable-length coding
(VLC) is the Huffman code. The coding part can be easily
implemented as a look-up table to achieve a high output rate.
On the other hand, its decoding end can be implemented in a
number of VLSI architectures to satisfy different input/output
data rates as surveyed by Chang and Messerchmitt (1992). The
VLSI architecture can be classiÔ¨Åed as tree-based and program-
mable logic array-based (PLA-based). The tree-based architec-
ture is a direct map of the Huffman binary tree. The average
decoding throughput of the pipelined version is in the range
of [Lmin, Lmax] bits/cycle, where Lmin and Lmax are minimum
and maximum code lengths, respectively. This rate is appar-
ently higher than a 1 bit/cycle of the sequential tree-based
architecture.
