Current FDTD and related space-grid time-domain algorithms
are fully explicit solvers employing highly vectorizable and
parallel schemes for time-marching the six components of
the electric and magnetic Ô¨Åeld vectors at each of the space
cells. The explicit nature of the solvers is usually maintained by
employing a leapfrog time-stepping scheme. Current methods
differ primarily in how the space lattice is set up. In fact,
gridding methods can be categorized according to the degree
of structure or regularity in the mesh cells.
