Do-loop or recurrent equation. The sampling rate of the
input signals inï¬‚uences the architectural style of algorithm-
to-hardware synthesis. As the sampling rate increases, more
parallellism/computation power is demanded from the hard-
ware architecture. Consequently, processing power can be
obtained from an implementation in either a network of inter-
connected execution units or a regular array of PEs.
