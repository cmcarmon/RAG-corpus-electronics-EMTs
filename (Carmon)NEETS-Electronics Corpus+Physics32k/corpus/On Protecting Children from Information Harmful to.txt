An amending law was enacted in July 2012. That law contained changes to other laws, introducing a "child-protecting" Internet blacklist not related to this law, so Russian Wikipedia protested the bill with a blackout.
The law prohibits the distribution of "harmful" material among minors, including material which "may elicit fear, horror, or panic in children", or depicts violence, unlawful activities, substance abuse, or self-harm. It has been amended twice; an amendment in 2012 instituted a mandatory content rating system for material distributed through an "information and telecommunication network" (covering television and the internet), and, in other laws, established a blacklist for censoring websites which describe suicide, glorify illegal drugs, or contain child pornography. A second amendment passed in 2013 added "propaganda" promoting "Non-traditional sexual relationships" as a class of harmful content under the law.
