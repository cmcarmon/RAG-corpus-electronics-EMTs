Most hard disk drives use more than one hard disk platter to store data. These are called disk packs. 
Some hard disk drives use removable hard disk platters. These can use just one platter, or they can use 
disk packs containing many platters. Most of the multi-platter removable hard disk drives in use today use 
14" hard disk platters. Figure 8-4 shows a hard disk-pack.
