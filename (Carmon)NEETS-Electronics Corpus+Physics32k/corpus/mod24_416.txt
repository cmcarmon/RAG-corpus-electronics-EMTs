Figure 4-22 shows one type of heavy-duty connector designed for use in harsh Navy environments.
This connector is described by the military specification MIL-C-28876. This connector comes in various
sizes capable of terminating 2, 4, 6, or 8 fibers. Each fiber termination, called a terminus, is of the
cylindrical ferrule type. Two slightly different termini are used to form a connection; a pin terminus and a
socket terminus. The pin terminus consists of a terminus body, which holds the terminus within the
connector shell and a ceramic ferrule. The socket terminus consists of a terminus body, a ceramic ferrule,
and an alignment sleeve, which attaches to the ceramic ferrule. Fiber alignment occurs when the pin
terminus slides into the alignment sleeve of the socket terminus. The termini are held within an insert in
the connector shell. When the connector halves are mated, the connector inserts align the mating termini,
which then align the mating fibers. The connector shell and backshell protect the termini from the
surrounding environment and provide strain relief for the multifiber cable.
