The minus sign associated with Faraday’s law in Equation (12.2.5) implies generator reference
directions, as explained earlier. Considering the right-hand side of Equation (12.2.5), the ﬁrst term
is a speed voltage caused by the relative motion of the ﬁeld and the stator coil. The second term
is a transformer voltage, which is negligible in most rotating machines under normal steady-state
operation because the amplitude of the air-gap ﬂux wave is fairly constant. The induced voltage
is then given by the speed voltage itself,
