Digital Block
The depth is determined in the digital part from data obtained
through pressure and temperature measurements and then
represented as electrical quantities. In the ﬁrst intermediate
step, the actual temperature is calculated using the temperature
data represented in 6-bit. This is followed by the calculation of
the actual pressure from the pressure data given in 12-bit. The
conversion of the speciﬁed pressure to a depth below the water
surface is obtained by means of following equation:
