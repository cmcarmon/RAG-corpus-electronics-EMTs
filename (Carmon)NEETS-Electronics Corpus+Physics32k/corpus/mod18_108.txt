The receiver accepts the weak echo signals from the antenna system, amplifies them, detects the
pulse envelope, amplifies the pulses, and then routes them to the indicator. One of the primary functions
of the radar receiver is to convert the frequency of the received echo signal to a lower frequency that is
easier to amplify. This is because radar frequencies are very high and difficult to amplify. This lower
frequency is called the INTERMEDIATE FREQUENCY (IF). The type of receiver that uses this
frequency conversion technique is the SUPER HETERODYNE RECEIVER. Superheterodyne receivers
used in radar systems must have good stability and extreme sensitivity. Stability is ensured by careful
design and the overall sensitivity is greatly increased by the use of many IF stages.
