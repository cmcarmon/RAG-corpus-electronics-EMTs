There are also approximate conservation laws. These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.
Conservation of rest mass
Conservation of baryon number (See chiral anomaly and sphaleron)
Conservation of lepton number (In the Standard Model)
Conservation of flavor (violated by the weak interaction)
Conservation of parity
Invariance under charge conjugation
Invariance under time reversal
CP symmetry, the combination of charge and parity conjugation (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)
