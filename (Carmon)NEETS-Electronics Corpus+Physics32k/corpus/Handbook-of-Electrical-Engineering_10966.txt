Figure 113.6 illustrates strength-duration curves derived from the myelinated nerve model described previ-
ously under the same conditions applying to Fig. 113.5. Three types of stimulus current apply to Fig. 113.6: a
monophasic constant current pulse, a symmetric biphasic rectangular current, and a single cycle of a sine wave.
The phase duration indicated on the horizontal axis applies to the initial cathodal half cycle for the two biphasic
waves. Stimulus magnitude is given in terms of peak current on the right vertical axis and in terms of the charge
in a single monophasic phase of the stimulus on the left vertical axis. The charge is computed by Q = Itp for
the rectangular waveforms and Q = (2/p)Itp for the sinusoidal waveforms (I is threshold current and tp is phase
duration).
