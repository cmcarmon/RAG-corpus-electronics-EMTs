Op-amp circuits themselves can be regarded as building blocks. These blocks are charac-
terized by their input resistance, output resistance, and open-circuit voltage ampliﬁcation. The
symbol for the op amp is shown in Figure 5.2.1. Two terminals labeled + and − are available
for inputs. The voltages of these terminals are labeled with respect to the common terminal,
