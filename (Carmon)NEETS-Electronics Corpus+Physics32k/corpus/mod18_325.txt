During the transmitting pulse, an arc appears across both spark gaps and causes the tr and atr circuits
to act as shorted (closed-end) quarter-wave stubs. The circuits then reflect an open circuit to the tr and atr
circuit connections to the main transmission line. None of the transmitted energy can pass through these
reflected opens into the atr stub or into the receiver. Therefore, all of the transmitted energy is directed to
the antenna.
