Error Detection and Recovery
Due to the transmission impairments, a message arriving at
the receiving station might be in error. The receiving station
will detect the error and might ask the sending station for a
retransmission. It is very rare that the receiving station would
correct errors. The approach for requesting a retransmission
when an error is detected is called forward correction. The
error detection is mostly done at the data link layer that is the
second layer of the network architecture although some error
detection schemes might be done at the Ô¨Årst layer, the physical
layer of the network architecture. The error detection schemes
that have been used are described below. The cyclic redun-
dancy check (CRC) is a most commonly used error detection
scheme at the data link layer.
