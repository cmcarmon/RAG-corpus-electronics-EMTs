In the course of learning about electricity, you will want to construct your own circuits using
resistors and batteries. Some options are available in this matter of circuit assembly, some
easier than others. In this section, I will explore a couple of fabrication techniques that will
not only help you build the circuits shown in this chapter, but also more advanced circuits.
