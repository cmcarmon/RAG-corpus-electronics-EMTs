{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \sigma }{\mathrm {d} (\cos \theta )}}={\frac {\pi \alpha ^{2}}{s}}\left(u^{2}\left({\frac {1}{s}}+{\frac {1}{t}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {t}{s}}\right)^{2}+\left({\frac {s}{t}}\right)^{2}\right)\,}


where s,t, and u are the Mandelstam variables,



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the fine-structure constant, and



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the scattering angle.
This cross section is calculated neglecting the electron mass relative to the collision energy and including only the contribution from photon exchange. This is a valid approximation at collision energies small compared to the mass scale of the Z boson, about 91 GeV; at higher energies the contribution from Z boson exchange also becomes important.
