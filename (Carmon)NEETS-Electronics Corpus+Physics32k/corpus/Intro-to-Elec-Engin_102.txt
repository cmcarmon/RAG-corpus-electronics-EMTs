An ideal transformer is one that has no losses (associated with iron or copper) and no
leakage ﬂuxes (i.e., all the ﬂux in the core links both the primary and the secondary windings).
The winding resistances are negligible. While these properties are never actually achieved in
practical transformers, they are, however, approached closely. When a time-varying voltage v1
is applied to the N1-turn primary winding (assumed to have zero resistance), a core ﬂux φ is
established and a counter emf e1 with the polarity shown in Figure 1.2.12 is developed such that
e1 is equal to v1. Because there is no leakage ﬂux with an ideal transformer, the ﬂux φ also links
all N2 turns of the secondary winding and produces an induced emf e2, according to Faraday’s
law of induction. Since v1 = e1 = dλ1/dt = N1 dφ/dt and v2 = e2 = dλ2/dt = N2 dφ/dt, it
follows from Figure 1.2.12 that
