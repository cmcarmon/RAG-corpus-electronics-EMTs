Sallen and Key Section
This is an early and simple example of a second-order section building block [Sallen and Key, 1955]. It remains
a commonly used Ô¨Ålter despite its age, and it will serve to illustrate some key stages in the design of all such
RC-active sections. The circuit is shown in Fig. 29.4. A straightforward analysis of this circuit yields a VTF
