Aside from such special cases, however, numerical evaluation of the direct-matrix coefﬁcients will involve
the  equivalent  of  point  sampling  of  whatever  order  is  needed  to  achieve  the  desired  accuracy  as  illustrated
below. Using a wirelike one-dimensional problem to illustrate this point, we observe that at its most elementary
level evaluation of the ijth matrix coefﬁcient then involves evaluating integrals of the form
