Integration of the right-hand side over all of space encom-
passes the volume containing the charge density and simply
gives the total charge enclosed. The result is Gauss’s Law
stating that
the total electric ﬂux crossing any surface
bounding the charge is equal to the total charge enclosed in
that surface, clearly a conservation law:
