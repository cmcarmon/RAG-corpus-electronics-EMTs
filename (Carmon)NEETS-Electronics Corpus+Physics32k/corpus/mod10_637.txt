Look at view B of figure 4-10 and assume that the center of the concentric circles is the Sun. Assume 
that a radius is drawn from the Sun (center of the circle) to position 0 of the circle. When you move to 
position 1, the radius moves to position 1; when you move to position 2, the radius also moves to position 
2, and so on.
