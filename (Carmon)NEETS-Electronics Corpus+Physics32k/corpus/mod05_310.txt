To understand how the synchronous motor works, assume that the application of three-phase ac
power to the stator causes a rotating magnetic field to be set up around the rotor. The rotor is energized
with dc (it acts like a bar magnet). The strong rotating magnetic field attracts the strong rotor field
activated by the dc. This results in a strong turning force on the rotor shaft. The rotor is therefore able to
turn a load as it rotates in step with the rotating magnetic field.
