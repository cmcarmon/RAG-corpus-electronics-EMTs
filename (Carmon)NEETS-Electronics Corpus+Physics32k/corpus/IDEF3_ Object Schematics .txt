IDEF offers a series of building blocks to express detailed object-centered process information; that is, information about how objects of various kinds are transformed into other kinds of things through a process, or how objects of a given kind change states through a process.
Objects : An object of a certain kind, like a chassis, will be represented simply by a circle containing an appropriate label.
Object States : A certain kind of object being in a certain state will be represented by a circle with a label that captures the kind itself and a corresponding state, representing thereby the type, or class, of objects that are in that state.
Object schematics : The construction of complex representations built from kind symbols and object state symbols.
Transition Schematics : The first and most basic construct is the basic state transition schematic or simply, transition schematic.
