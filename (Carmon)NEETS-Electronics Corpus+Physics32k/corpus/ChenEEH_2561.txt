openings only for input and/or output coupling of electromag-
netic energy. Cavity resonators are usually in the form of empty
or dielectric-Ô¨Ålled rectangular or circular waveguide bodies as
well as coaxial line sections. The Fabry-Perot cavity is a special
case of a quasioptical resonator. The resonance takes place
between two face-to-face mirrors while other boundaries are
open space. Therefore, it is sometimes called open or quasiop-
tical resonator and is useful at very high frequency.
