Force between charges 
 
Coulombâ€™s Law states that, if charged bodies exist 
at two points, the force of attraction (if the charges 
are of opposite polarity) or repulsion (if the charges 
have the same polarity) will be proportional to the 
product of the magnitude of the charges divided by 
the square of their distance apart. Thus:
