The highest occupied orbital energy level of dioxygen is a pair of degenerate π* orbitals. In the ground state of dioxygen, this energy level is occupied by two electrons of the same spin, as shown in the molecular orbital diagram. The molecule therefore has two unpaired electrons and is in a triplet state.
In contrast the first excited state of dioxygen has two electrons of opposite spin in the π* level so that there are no unpaired electrons. In consequence it is a singlet state and is known as singlet oxygen.
