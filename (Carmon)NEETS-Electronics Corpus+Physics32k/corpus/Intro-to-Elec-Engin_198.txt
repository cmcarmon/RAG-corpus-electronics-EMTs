The MATLAB environment consists of a command window, a ﬁgure window, and a platform-
dependent edit window, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.2. The command window, which is the main
window, is characterized by the MATLAB command prompt >>. All commands, including
those for running user-written programs, are typed in this window at the MATLAB prompt. The
graphics window or the ﬁgure window receives the output of all graphics commands typed in the
command window. The user can create as many ﬁgure windows as the system memory would
allow. The edit window is where one writes, edits, creates, and saves one’s own programs in ﬁles
called M-ﬁles. Most programs that are written in MATLAB are saved as M-ﬁles, and all built-in
functions in MATLAB are M-ﬁles.
