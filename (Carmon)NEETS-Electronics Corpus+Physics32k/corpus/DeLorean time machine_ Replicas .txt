A number of private auto customizers have built replicas of the DeLorean time machine. Starting with a stock DMC-12, they added most, if not all, the props used by the movie producers for the picture cars. In addition to the interior and exterior props, they feature working indicator lights and switches along with the actual sounds which duplicate the ones made by the movie car's controls when activated. These vehicles are, for the most part, roadworthy DeLoreans with stock drivetrains, and are frequently driven to car shows and Back to the Future-related events.
As of March 2017, some 87 DeLorean DMC-12s are known to be converted to Back to the Future Time Machines. A Listing of these can be found on the Texas DeLorean Club web site, which maintains a complete list of categorized DeLorean automobiles by VIN.
