One-half cycle later the polarity across the secondary of the transformer reverses, forward biasing D2 
and D4 and reverse biasing D1 and D3. Current flow will now be from point A through D4, up through 
RL, through D2, through the secondary of T1, and back to point A. This path is indicated by the broken 
arrows. Waveforms (3) and (4) can be observed across D2 and D4. You should have noted that the current 
flow through R L is always in the same direction. In flowing through R L this current develops a voltage 
corresponding to that shown in waveform (5). Since current flows through the load (RL) during both half 
cycles of the applied voltage, this bridge rectifier is a full-wave rectifier.
