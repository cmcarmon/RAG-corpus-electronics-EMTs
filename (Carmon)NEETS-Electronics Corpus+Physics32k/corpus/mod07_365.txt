The construction of an N-channel MOSFET is shown in figure 3-53. Heavily doped N-type regions 
(indicated by the N+) are diffused into a P-type substrate or base. A channel of regular N-type material is 
diffused between the heavily doped N-type regions. A metal oxide insulating layer is then formed over 
the channel, and a metal gate layer is deposited over the insulating layer. There is no electrical connection 
between the gate and the rest of the device. This construction method results in the extremely high input 
impedance of the MOSFET. Another common name for the device, derived from the construction 
method, is the insulated gate field effect transistor (IGFET).
