INPUT BIAS CURRENT IB
When operated at extremely low quiescent current values, the base bias currents will be low; but
they do have to be taken into consideration. The input bias current IB for an op amp is deﬁned as
the average of the two input currents with the inputs grounded (see Figure 5.3.5), i.e.,
