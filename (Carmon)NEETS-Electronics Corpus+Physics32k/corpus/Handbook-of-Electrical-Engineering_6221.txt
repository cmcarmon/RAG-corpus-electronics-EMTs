Transmitters
FM broadcast transmitters typically range in power output from 10 W to 50 kW. A block diagram of a dual
FM  transmitter  is  shown  in  Fig. 69.14.  This  system  consists  of  two  25-kW  transmitters  that  are  operated  in
parallel and that provide increased reliability in the event of a failure in either the exciter or transmitter power
ampliﬁer. The highest-powered solid-state transmitters are currently 10 kW, but manufacturers are developing
new devices that will make higher-power solid-state transmitters both cost-efﬁcient and reliable.
