The circuits to be used in testing are selected by a prepunched card. These cards are made of tough
vinyl plastic material. The tube numbers are printed in color on the tabs of the cards and also at the edge
of the card for convenience in filing. A special card is provided to use as a marker when a card is removed
for use. Blank cards are provided so that additional test cards may be punched for new tubes that are
developed or to replace cards that have become unserviceable.
