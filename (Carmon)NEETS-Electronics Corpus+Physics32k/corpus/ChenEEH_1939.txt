Under the NC approach, each logic cell u in the FPGA is
assigned a cover cell that can be reconﬁgured to replace the
logic cell in the event that cell u becomes faulty. Reconﬁgu-
ration around a faulty u is completed by a replacement
sequence in which u is replaced by one of its covers which in
turn is replaced by one of its covers, and so on until a spare cell
is conﬁgured in.
