The Q.931 signaling protocol is used for call setup and
teardown between two H.323 endpoints and is a lightweight
version of the Q.931 protocol deﬁned for PSTN/ISDN. The
H.245 media control protocol is used for negotiating media
processing capabilities, such as audio/video codec to be used
for each media type between two terminals, and determining
master–slave relationships.
