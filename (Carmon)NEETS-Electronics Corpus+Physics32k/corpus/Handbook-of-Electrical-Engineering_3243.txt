Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Drive
Permanent magnet (PM) machine drives are quite popular in the low-power range. A PM machine can have
sinusoidal or concentrated winding, giving the corresponding sinusoidal or trapezoidal induced stator voltage
wave.  Figure 30.50  shows  the  speed  control  system  using  a  trapezoidal  machine,  and  Fig. 30.51  explains  the
wave  forms.  The  power  MOSFET  inverter  supplies  variable-frequency,  variable-magnitude  six-step  current
wave to the stator. The inverter is self-controlled, that is, the ﬁring pulses are generated by the machine position
sensor through a decoder. It can be shown that such a drive has the features of dc drive and is normally deﬁned
as brushless dc drive. The speed control loop generates the dc current command, which is then controlled by
the hysteresis-band method to construct the six-step phase current waves in correct phase relation with the
induced voltage waves as shown in Fig. 30.51. The drive can easily operate in four-quadrant mode.
