Logic clips, as shown in figure 2-24, are spring-loaded devices that are designed to clip onto a dual-
in-line package IC while the IC is mounted in its circuit. It is a simple device that usually has 16 light
emitting diodes (LEDs) mounted at the top of the clips. The LEDs correspond to the individual pins of the
IC, and any lit LED represents a high logic state. An unlit LED represents a low logic state. Logic clips
require no external power connections, and they are small and lightweight. Their ability to simultaneously
monitor the input and output of an IC is very helpful when you are troubleshooting a logic circuit.
