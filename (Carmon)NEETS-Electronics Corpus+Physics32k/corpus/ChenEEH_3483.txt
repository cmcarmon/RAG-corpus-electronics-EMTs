Because power quality is often stated in terms of voltages and
currents, the main instrumentation needed to assess power
quality relates to bus voltages and line and load currents. In
terms of voltages, usually bus voltages are measured using
potential transformers because isolation from the power cir-
cuit is desirable and because power system voltages are usually
too high to measure directly. Typical potential transformers are
capable of bringing circuit voltages (e.g., in the 440–7200 V
range for distribution circuits and up to 40 kV for subtrans-
mission circuits) to about 110 V. These potential transformers
must have the proper bandwidth to ‘‘see’’ the desired voltages
to be instrumented (e.g., harmonic voltages), they must have
the proper dynamic range to allow measurement of the volt-
age, and they must have isolation suitable for safety. Some
voltage measurement instruments are listed in Table 10.3.
