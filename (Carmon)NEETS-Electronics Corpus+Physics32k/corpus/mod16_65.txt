When a specific instrument has been designed for multiple calibration intervals, such information is
provided in the applicable calibration procedure. The SPECIAL CALIBRATION label or tag is annotated
with the words MULTIPLE INTERVAL, and the type of calibration performed is indicated; for example,
partial 1 of 2, 2 of 2, complete calibration, and so forth. The calibration due date reflects the due date of
the next partial or complete calibration.
