A saros-inex panorama has been produced by Luca Quaglia and John Tilley. It shows 61775 solar eclipses from −11000 (11001 BC) to +15000.
Each column of the graph is a complete Saros series which progresses smoothly from partial eclipses into total or annular eclipses and back into partials. Each graph row represents an inex series.
The lifetime and form of each inex series is not simple due to long term period variations: the synodic, draconic and anomalistic months. One can see from the data file that in the future (around saros series 300) the graph is horizontal (meaning that an after interval of an inex the moon will be at the same latitude), whereas at the beginning of the panorama around 11,000 BC for the moon to come back to the same latitude at another eclipse required about one saros for every ten inex. This implies that back then 3580+223 or 3803 synodic months equaled 3885+242 or 4127 draconic months. So a synodic month was about 1.0851960 draconic months, as compared to 1.0851958 today. This decrease by about 0.2 ppm can be compared to the decrease in the length of a tropical year by about 1 ppm in the last 10,000 years (see Tropical year). (Note that if the lengthh of a sidereal month were constant, then a decrease in the length of a year would cause an increase in the length of a synodic month.)
From the data file we can see that eclipses recur with a period of a combination of 15 inex and 1 saros (5593 synodic months, 165164.58 days, or 452.2 tropical years) throughout the whole panorama (26,000 years), for example from the eclipse of saros series −290, inex series 2 (slightly off the panorama to the left) to the eclipse of saros series 580, inex series 60 on the right-side edge of the panorama. Similar cycles with more or less than 15 inex per saros also cover the whole panorama.
