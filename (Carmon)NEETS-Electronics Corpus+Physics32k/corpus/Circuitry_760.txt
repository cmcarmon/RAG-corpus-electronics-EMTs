Analogue sensors are sometimes used in situations 
where  it  is  only  necessary  to  respond  to  a  pre-
determined  threshold  value.  In  effect,  a  two-state 
digital  output  is  required.  In  such  cases  a  simple 
one-bit  analogue-to-digital  converter  based  on  a 
comparator can be used. Such an arrangement is, of 
course, very much simpler and more cost-effective 
than  making  use  of  a  conventional  analogue  input 
port!
