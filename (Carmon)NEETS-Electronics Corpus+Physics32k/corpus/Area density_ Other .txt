It is also an important quantity for the absorption of radiation.
When studying bodies falling through air, area density is important because resistance depends on area, and gravitational force is dependent on mass.
Bone density is often expressed in grams per square centimeter (g·cm−2) as measured by x-ray absorptiometry, as a proxy for the actual density.
The body mass index is expressed in units of kilograms per square meter, though the area figure is nominal, being simply the square of the height.
The total electron content in the ionosphere is a quantity of type columnar number density.
Snow water equivalent is a quantity of type columnar mass density.
