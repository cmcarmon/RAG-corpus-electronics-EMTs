Although the noninvasive PEMF treatment for nonunions (fractures that fail to heal) became—at least in
the United States—the most widely used clinical application of subradio frequency ﬁelds, several investigators
pursued  the  application  of  dc  electric  ﬁelds  through  implanted  electrodes  and  the  application  of  higher-
frequency  currents  through  electrode  contacts  placed  on  the  skin  surface  to  enhance  bone  repair  [Brighton
et al., 1979]. At the same time mostly laboratory investigations, in vitro and on animals, explored the application
of  all  three  modalities—PEMF,  implanted  dc  electrodes,  and  higher-frequency  coupling  through  skin  elec-
trodes—to produce blood vessel regeneration (angiogenesis), soft tissue healing, nerve repair or regeneration,
and regression of tumors. Claimed to be useful in edema and pain management and for acceleration of wound
repair is pulsed radio frequency (PRF), mainly the diathermy frequency of 27.12 MHz assigned by the FCC,
at  an  average  power  level  that  should  usually  produce  only  very  moderate  tissue  heating  [Kloth  and  Ziskin,
1996; Markov, 1995]. Motivated by the suggested clinical applications, a large number of basic science investi-
gations have been initiated, and are continuing today, with the object of understanding the mechanisms through
which low-intensity electric and magnetic ﬁelds affect cells and living tissue. Some of these are reviewed brieﬂy
in the subsection Mechanisms and Dosimetry.
