Field-Effect Transistors
A cross-sectional view of a microwave MESFET is shown in Fig. 39.13. The device is conceptionally very simple.
The MESFET has two ohmic contacts (the source and drain) separated by some distance, usually in the range
of 3 to 10 mm. A rectifying Schottky contact (the gate) is located between the two ohmic contacts. Typically,
the gate length is on the order of 0.1 to 2 mm for modern microwave devices. The width of the device scales
with frequency and typically ranges from about 1 to 10 mm for power microwave devices to 50 mm for millimeter-
wave devices. All three contacts are located on the surface of a thin conducting layer (the channel) which is
located on top of a high-resistivity, nonconductive substrate to form the device. The channel region is typically
very thin (on the order of 0.1–0.3 mm) and is fabricated by epitaxial growth or ion implantation. In operation,
the drain contact is biased at a speciﬁed potential (positive drain potential for an n-channel device) and the
source  is  grounded.  The  ﬂow  of  current  through  the  conducting  channel  is  controlled  by  negative  dc  and
superimposed RF potentials applied to the gate, which modulate the channel current and provide RF gain. The
current  ﬂow  is  composed  of  only  one  type  of  charge  carrier  (generally  electrons)  and  the  device  is  termed
unipolar.  The  MESFET  can  be  fabricated  from  a  variety  of  semiconductors,  but  is  generally  fabricated  from
GaAs. MESFETs fabricated from Si do not work at high frequencies as well as those fabricated from GaAs due
to lower electron mobility in Si (e.g., m
n ;6000 cm2/V-s for GaAs and 1450 cm2/V-s for Si). The lower electron
mobility in Si produces high source resistance, which seriously degrades the high-frequency gain possible from
the device.
