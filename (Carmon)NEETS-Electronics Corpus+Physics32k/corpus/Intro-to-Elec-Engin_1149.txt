induction motors are usually two-pole or four-pole, rated at 2 hp or less, while slower and larger
motors can be manufactured for special purposes. Single-phase induction motors are widely used
in domestic appliances and for a very large number of low-power drives in industry. The single-
phase induction machine resembles a small, three-phase, squirrel-cage motor, except that at full
speed only a single winding on the stator is usually excited.
