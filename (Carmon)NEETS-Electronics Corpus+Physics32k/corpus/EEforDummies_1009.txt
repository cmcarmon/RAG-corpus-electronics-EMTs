Some circuits accept inputs from and send outputs to other circuits or 
devices. Schematics often show what looks like a loose wire leading into or 
out of the circuit. Usually it’s labeled something like signal input, or input from 
doodad #1, or output so you know you’re supposed to connect something up 
to it. (You connect one wire of the signal to this input point and the other to 
signal ground.) Other schematics may show a symbol for a specific connec-
tor, such as a plug and jack pair, which connect an output signal from one 
device to the input of another device. (Chapter 12 provides a closer look.)
