The capacitor shown in figure 3-21 represents either a mica capacitor or a molded paper capacitor. To
determine the type and value of the capacitor, hold the capacitor so that the three arrows point left to right
(>). The first dot at the base of the arrow sequence (the left-most dot) represents the capacitor TYPE. This
dot is either black, white, silver, or the same color as the capacitor body. Mica is represented by a black or
white dot and paper by a silver dot or dot having the same color as the body of the capacitor. The two dots to
the immediate right of the type dot indicate the first and second digits of the capacitance value. The dot at
the bottom right represents the multiplier to be used. The multiplier represents picofarads. The dot in the
bottom center indicates the tolerance value of the capacitor.
