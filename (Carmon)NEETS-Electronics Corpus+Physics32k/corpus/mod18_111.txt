A SINGLE STATIONARY-LOBE SCANNING SYSTEM is the simplest type of scanning. This
method produces a single beam that is stationary in relation to the antenna. The antenna is then
mechanically rotated continuously to obtain complete 360-degree azimuth coverage. A stationary lobe,
however, cannot satisfactorily track a moving object because it does not provide enough information
about the objectâ€™s movement to operate automatic tracking circuits, such as those in fire-control tracking
