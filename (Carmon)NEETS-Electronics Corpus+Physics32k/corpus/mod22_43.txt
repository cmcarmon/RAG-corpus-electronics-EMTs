Computers are employed when repetitious calculations or the processing of large amounts of data are 
necessary. The most frequent applications are found in the military, scientific, and commercial fields. 
They are used in many varied projects, ranging from mail sorting, through engineering design, to the 
identification and destruction of enemy targets. The advantages of digital computers include speed, 
accuracy, reliability, and man-power savings. Frequently computers are able to take over routine jobs, 
releasing people for more important work; work that cannot be handled by a computer.
