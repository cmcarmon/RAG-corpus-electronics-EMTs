Basic  stuck-at  fault  testing  techniques  address  combinational  digital  systems.  Three  of  the  most  popular
stuck-at fault testing techniques are the D algorithm, the Path-Oriented Decision Making (Podem) algorithm,
and the Fan algorithm. These algorithms Ô¨Årst identify a circuit fault, e.g., stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1, and then
try to generate an input stimulus that detects the fault and makes the fault visible at an output. Detecting a
fault is called fault sensitization and making a fault visible is called fault propagation. To illustrate this process,
consider the simple combinational design in Fig. 34.18 [Goel, 1981; Fujiwara and Shimono, 1983].
