Figure 4.12: A signal which has a triangular shaped spectrum is shown in the top plot. Its highest
frequency — the largest frequency containing power — is W Hz. Once amplitude modulated, the resulting
spectrum has “lines” corresponding to the Fourier series components at ±fc and the original triangular
spectrum shifted to components at ±fc and scaled by 1
