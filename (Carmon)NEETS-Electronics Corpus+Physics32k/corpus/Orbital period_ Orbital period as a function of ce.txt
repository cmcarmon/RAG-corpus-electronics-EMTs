When a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density ρ (in kg/m3), the above equation simplifies to (since M = Vρ = 4/3πa3ρ)>:




T
=




3
π


G
ρ






{\displaystyle T={\sqrt {\frac {3\pi }{G\rho }}}}

So, for the Earth as the central body (or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density, about 5,515 kg/m3) we get:
T = 1.41 hours
and for a body made of water (ρ ≈ 1,000 kg/m3)
T = 3.30 hours
Thus, as an alternative for using a very small number like G, the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material, like water: the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes. Conversely, this can be used as a kind of "universal" unit of time if we have a unit of mass, a unit of length and a unit of density.
