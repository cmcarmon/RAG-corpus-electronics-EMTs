its plates,  creating a voltage across the plates 
(see  the  section  “Charging  and  Discharging 
Capacitors”). A battery’s electrical energy is the 
result of an energy conversion process originat-
ing from the chemicals stored inside the battery, 
whereas a capacitor’s electrical energy is sup-
plied by a source outside the capacitor.
