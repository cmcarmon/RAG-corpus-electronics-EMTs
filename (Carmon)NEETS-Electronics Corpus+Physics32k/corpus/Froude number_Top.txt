In continuum mechanics, the Froude number (Fr) is a dimensionless number defined as the ratio of the flow inertia to the external field (the latter in many applications simply due to gravity). Named after William Froude (;), the Froude number is based on the speedâ€“length ratio which he defined as:





F
r

=



u

0




g

0



l

0







{\displaystyle \mathrm {Fr} ={\frac {u_{0}}{\sqrt {g_{0}l_{0}}}}}

where u0 is a characteristic flow velocity, g0 is in general a characteristic external field, and l0 is a characteristic length. The Froude number has some analogy with the Mach number. In theoretical fluid dynamics the Froude number is not frequently considered since usually the equations are considered in the high Froude limit of negligible external field, leading to homogeneous equations that preserve the mathematical aspects. For example, homogeneous Euler equations are conservation equations.
However, in naval architecture the Froude number is a very significant figure used to determine the resistance of a partially submerged object moving through water. Dynamics of vessels that have the same Froude number are easily compared as they produce a similar wake, even if their size or geometry are otherwise different.
The Denny Ship Model Experiment tank in Dumbarton, Scotland, has a bust of Froude near the front door.
