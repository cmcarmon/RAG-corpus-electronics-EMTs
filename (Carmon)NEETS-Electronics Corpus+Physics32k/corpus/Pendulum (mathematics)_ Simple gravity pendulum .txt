A so-called "simple pendulum" is an idealization of a "real pendulum" but in an isolated system using the following assumptions:
The rod or cord on which the bob swings is massless, inextensible and always remains taut;
The bob is a point mass;
Motion occurs only in two dimensions, i.e. the bob does not trace an ellipse but an arc.
The motion does not lose energy to friction or air resistance.
The gravitational field is uniform.
The support does not move.
The differential equation which represents the motion of a simple pendulum is

where g is acceleration due to gravity, l is the length of the pendulum, and θ is the angular displacement.
