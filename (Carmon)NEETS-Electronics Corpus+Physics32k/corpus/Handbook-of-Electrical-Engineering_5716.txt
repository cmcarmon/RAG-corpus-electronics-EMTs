Dips with durations of less than half a cycle are regarded as transients.
A voltage dip may be caused by switching operations associated with temporary disconnection of supply,
the  ﬂow  of  heavy  current  associated  with  the  start  of  large  motor  loads  or  the  ﬂow  of  fault  currents.  These
events may emanate from customers’ systems or from the public supply network.
