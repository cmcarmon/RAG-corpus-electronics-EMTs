A further suggestion is that positive ions increase in abundance during a full Moon and that this should be expected to influence human behavior. However, this is a pseudo-scientific claim. Not only is the increase in frequency extremely slight (much smaller than that caused by air conditioning and air pollution), but ionic charge – positive or negative – has no effect on human behavior, and no physiological effect other than static electric shock.
Studies have shown that with regard to certain types of depression such as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), negative air ionization therapy has no statistically significant benefits beyond placebo. Moreover, such treatments require ionization many orders of magnitude greater than any differences produced by the lunar cycle, and there are superior effects found by using similar treatments with bright light instead of ion generators.
