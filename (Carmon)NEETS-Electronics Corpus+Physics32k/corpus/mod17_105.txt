FLEET BROADCASTS.â€”As the name implies, this service involves broadcast area coverage from 
shore-based transmitters to ships at sea. Messages to be sent to ships are delivered by various means to 
the proper broadcast station. They are then broadcast for shipboard reception. To overcome propagation 
problems, naval communicators send the messages on several frequencies at once. This is known as 
frequency-diversity transmission. This type of transmission allows the ship to choose the best frequency 
for reception. Space-diversity with physically separated receive antennas also helps to overcome this 
problem.
