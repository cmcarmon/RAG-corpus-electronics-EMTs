Digit serial: Processing of more than one but not all bits in one clock cycle. If the digit size is W1 and the
word length is W, then the word is processed in W/W1 clock cycles. If W1 = 1, then the system is referred
to  as  a  bit-serial  and  if W1  = W,  then  the  system  is  referred  to  as  a  bit-parallel  system.  In  general,  the
digit  size W1  need  not  be  a  divisor  of  the  word  length W,  since  the  least  and  most  signiÔ¨Åcant  bits  of
consecutive words can be overlapped and processed in the same clock cycle.
