The general problems of analyzing any given ampliﬁer to determine ωL or ωH , and of
designing ampliﬁers with speciﬁc values of ωL and ωH , are extremely complex and well beyond
the scope of this text. Speciﬁc ampliﬁer cases can, however, be considered in order to gain a sense
of what is involved in determining the frequency response. Toward that end let us consider the CS
JFET ampliﬁer shown in Figure 8.4.1(a). The small-signal ac equivalent circuit for low frequencies
near ωL is depicted in Figure 8.5.2(a), that for high frequencies near ωH in Figure 8.5.2(b).
