In Hindu tantrism there are five tattvas creating global energy cycles of tattvic tides beginning at dawn with Akasa and ending with Prithvi:
Akasa (Spirit tattva) – symbolized by a black egg
Vayu (Air tattva) – symbolized by a blue circle
Tejas (Fire tattva) – symbolized by a red triangle
Apas (Water tattva) – symbolized by a silver crescent
Prithvi (Earth tattva) – symbolized by a yellow square
Each complete cycle lasts two hours. This system of five tattvas which each can be combined with another, was also adapted by the Golden Dawn (→Tattva vision).
