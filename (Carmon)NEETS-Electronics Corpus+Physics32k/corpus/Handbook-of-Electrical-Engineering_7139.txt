The design for a constellation of satellites to serve communications needs, such as the number of satellites,
their orbital parameters, the satellite G/T and EIRP, etc. are topics related to mission analysis and design and
involve trades of many factors such as total communications capacity, link margins, space and earth segment
costs, reliability, interconnectivity, availability and cost of launch vehicles, mission lifetime, and system opera-
tions [Wertz and Larson, 1991].
