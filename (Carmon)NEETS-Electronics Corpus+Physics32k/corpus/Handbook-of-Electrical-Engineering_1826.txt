which is referred to as the wavenumber–frequency spectrum of s(x,t), and (k1,k2,k3) D k denotes the wavenum-
ber variables in radians per unit distance and w is the frequency variable in radians per second. If c denotes
the velocity of propagation of the plane wave, the following constraint must be satisﬁed
