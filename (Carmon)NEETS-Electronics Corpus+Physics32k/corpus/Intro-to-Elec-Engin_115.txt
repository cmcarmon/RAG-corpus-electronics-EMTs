PTs are employed to step down the voltage to a suitable level, whereas CTs (connected in
series with the line) are used to step down the current for metering purposes. Often the primary of
a CT is not an integral part of the transformer itself, but is a part of the line whose current is being
measured. In addition to providing a desirable low current in the metering circuit, the CT isolates
the meter from the line, which may be at a high potential. Note that the secondary terminals
of a CT should never be open-circuited under load. The student is encouraged to reason and
justify this precaution. One of the most useful instruments for measuring currents in the ampere
range is the clip-on ammeter combining the CT with one-turn primary and the measurement
functions.
