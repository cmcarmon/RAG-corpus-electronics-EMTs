An optical signal entering from the single-waveguide side of the junction is split into two optical signals with
the same relative phase but one-half the original intensity. Conversely, light incident on the two-waveguide side
of the junction will be combined into the single waveguide with a phase and intensity dependent on the original
inputs. Directional couplers consist of two or more waveguides fabricated in close proximity to each other so
that  the  optical  Ô¨Åelds  overlap  as  shown  in  Fig.  31.18.  As  a  result,  optical  power  is  transferred  between  the
waveguides.  The  extent  of  the  power  transfer  is  dependent  on  the  waveguide  characteristics,  the  waveguide
spacing, and the interaction length.
