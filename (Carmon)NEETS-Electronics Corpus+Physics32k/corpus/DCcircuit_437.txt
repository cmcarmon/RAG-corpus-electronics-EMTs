Looking at the ”total power dissipation” given to us by SPICE on this second simulation, we
see that it is 1.15E-01 watts, or 1.15 x 10−1 watts. The power of -1 corresponds to the metric
preﬁx ”deci,” but generally we limit our use of metric preﬁxes in electronics to those associated
with powers of ten that are multiples of three (ten to the power of . . . -12, -9, -6, -3, 3, 6, 9, 12,
etc.). So, if we want to follow this convention, we must express this power dissipation ﬁgure as
0.115 watts or 115 milliwatts (115 mW) rather than 1.15 deciwatts (1.15 dW).
