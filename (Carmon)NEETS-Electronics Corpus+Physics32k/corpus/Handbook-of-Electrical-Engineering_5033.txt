In  integrated  circuit  devices,  a  number  of  materials  are  suitable  for  thin-ﬁlm  capacitor  applications.  In
addition to Al2O3, tantalum pentoxide, Ta2O5, has been extensively utilized. It is characterized by high-temper-
ature stability and is resistant to acids with the exception of hydroﬂuoric acid (HF). The high dielectric constant
material hafnia (HfO2) has also been used in thin-ﬁlm capacitors.
Organic Solids
Solid organic dielectrics consist of large polymer molecules, which generally have molecular weights in excess
of 600. Primarily, with the exception of paper, which consists of cellulose that is comprised of a series of glucose
units, organic dielectric materials are synthetically derived.
