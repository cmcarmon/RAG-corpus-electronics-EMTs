RADIO FREQUENCY AMPLIFIER.â€”The rf amplifier unit is a two-stage linear power amplifier 
that produces an output of 1,000 watts with a nominal input of 100 milliwatts. Nineteen frequency bands 
are used to cover the operating frequency range. The operating band is automatically selected by digital 
coding generated by the transmitter. The code controls two motor-driven band switch assemblies. 
Automatic control circuits protect the unit against overload and compensate for variations in system gain, 
mode of operation, and loading.
