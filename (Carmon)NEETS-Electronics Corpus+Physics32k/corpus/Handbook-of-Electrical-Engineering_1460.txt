Dynamic Time Warping
Dynamic  time  warping  (DTW)  is  a  technique  for  nonlinear  time  alignment  of  pairs  of  spoken  utterances.
DTW-based  speech  recognition,  often  referred  to  as  “template  matching,”  involves  aligning  feature  vectors
extracted from an unknown utterance with those from a set of exemplars or templates obtained from training
data. Nonlinear feature alignment is necessitated by nonlinear time-scale warping associated with variations in
speaking rate.
