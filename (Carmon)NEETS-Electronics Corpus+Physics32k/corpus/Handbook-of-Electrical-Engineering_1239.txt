This theorem’s proof is a direct consequence of the fact that the Frobenius and Euclidean norm of the matrix
A and Q*AQ are equal for any unitary matrix Q. Upon setting Q equal to the n ·  n matrix whose columns are
equal  to  the n  orthonormal  eigenvectors  of  matrix A,  it  follows  that  the  Frobenius  (Euclidean)  norm  of  the
matrices A – B and Q*[A – B]Q are equal. From this equality the optimality of positive-deﬁnite matrix (14.107)
immediately  follows  since  Q*AQ  is  equal  to  the  diagonal  matrix  with  the  eigenvalues  of  A  as  its  diagonal
components. The closest positive-semideﬁnite matrix (14.107) is obtained by simply truncating the SVD to the
positive  singular  value  outer  products.  Similarly,  the  closest  orthogonal  projection  matrix  is  obtained  by
replacing each singular value by 1 if the singular value is greater than or equal to 0.5 and by 0 otherwise.
