P systems have such a wide data path (32 or 64 bits) that more than one
instruction  may  be  accessed  at  one  time.  These  machines  are  termed  very  long  instruction  word  (VLIW)
machines. They are able to execute more than one instruction per clock cycle, but they will be more complex
internally.  For  users,  both  the  simpler  RISC  and  the  complex  VLIW  machines  will  provide  increased
performance.
