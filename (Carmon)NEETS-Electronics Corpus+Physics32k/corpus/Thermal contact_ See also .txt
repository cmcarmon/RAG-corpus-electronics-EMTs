Thermal equilibrium - When two objects A and B are in thermal contact and there is no net transfer of thermal energy from A to B or from B to A, they are said to be in thermal equilibrium. The majority of objects experiencing thermal equilibrium still do exchange thermal energy but do so equally so that the net heat transfer is zero.
