Such observations are in contradiction with the scaling
theory. VLSI technology scaling has evolved at an amazingly
fast pace during the last 30 years; the minimum device size keeps
shrinking by a factor k ¼ 0:7 per technology generation. The
basic scaling theory, known as constant ﬁeld scaling mandates
the synergistic scaling of geometric features and silicon doping
levels to maintain a constant ﬁeld across the gate oxide of the
MOS transistor (Benini et al., 2001; Panasonic, 2000). According
to the constant ﬁeld scaling theory, power dissipation scales as k2
and power density (i.e., power dissipated per unit area) remains
constant while speed increases as k. Such contradiction between
the theory and conclusion from Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5 has
two causes. First, die size has been steadily increasing with
technology (Figure 5.6), causing an increase in total average
power, as shown in Figure 5.4. Second, supply voltage has scaled
much more slowly than device size because supply voltage levels
have been standardized and because faster transistor operation
can be obtained for higher supply voltage levels.
