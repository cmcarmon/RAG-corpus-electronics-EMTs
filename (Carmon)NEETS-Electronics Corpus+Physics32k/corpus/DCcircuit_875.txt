the voltmeterâ€™s copper leads will be a function of the difference in temperature between the
two junctions, and not the temperature at the measurement junction alone. Even for ther-
mocouple types where copper is not one of the dissimilar metals, the combination of the two
metals joining the copper leads of the measuring instrument forms a junction equivalent to the
measurement junction:
