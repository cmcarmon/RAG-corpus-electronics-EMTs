Polytetraﬂuoroethylene  (PTFE)  or  Teﬂon  is  a  fully  ﬂuorinated  version  of  PE,  having  a  repeat  unit  of
[–CF2–CF2–]. It is characterized by a low dielectric constant, extremely low losses, and has excellent temperature
stability  and  is  resistive  to  chemical  degradation.  It  has  been  extensively  used  in  specialized  applications  on
insulators, wires and cables, transformers, motors, and generators. Its relatively high cost is attributable to both
the higher cost of the ﬂuorinated monomers as well as the specialized fabrication techniques required.
