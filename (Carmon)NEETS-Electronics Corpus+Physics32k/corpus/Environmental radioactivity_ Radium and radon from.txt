Radium and radon are in the environment because they are decay products of uranium and thorium.
The radon (222Rn) released into the air decays to 210Pb and other radioisotopes, and the levels of 210Pb can be measured. The rate of deposition of this radioisotope is dependent on the weather. Below is a graph of the deposition rate observed in Japan.
