One example of a microcontroller-integrated cir-
cuit is the 8051, an 8-bit processor with ROM and 
RAM located on the chip as well as the I/O circuitry. 
The 8051 is a popular chip that is being produced and 
developed by several companies. Intelâ€™s version of the 
8051 chip is the MCS 251, which is 15 times faster 
than the MCS 51. A block diagram of the MCS 51 is 
shown in Figure 46-8.
