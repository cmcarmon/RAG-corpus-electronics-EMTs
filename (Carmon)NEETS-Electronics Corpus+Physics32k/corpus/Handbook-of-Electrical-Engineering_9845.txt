Now that we have illustrated the design computation with a very simple example, we are in a position to
state some general results. In the direct approach to design for a speciﬁed PM we assume a single lead network
equalizer such that the open-loop system to transfer function results. This approach to design results in the
following steps that are applicable for Bode diagram design to achieve maximum PM within an experientially
determined control system structure that comprises a ﬁxed plant and a compensation network with adjustable
parameters:
