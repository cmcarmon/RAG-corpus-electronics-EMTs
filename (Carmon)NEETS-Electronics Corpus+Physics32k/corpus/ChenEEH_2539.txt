the input signal at port 1 is divided into two parts. Some of the
power is combined at port 4 but out of phase by 1808. Thus, if
the signal amplitude is equal (depending on adequate choice of
branch-line admittance Ya1, Ya2, and Yb between both ports),
no signal appears at port 4, the signals at ports 2 and 3 may be
equal (3-dB) but out of phase by 908. In practice, the isolated
port 4 is terminated with a matched load. The power-dividing
ratio at ports 2 and 3 also depends on an appropriate choice of
the branch-line admittances. The direct and the coupling port
(2 and 3) may be connected to admittance Y02 that is different
from Y01 of the input port, which suggests that this type of
hybrid has impedance transformation properties.
