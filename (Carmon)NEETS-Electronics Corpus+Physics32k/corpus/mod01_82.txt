lacking only one or two electrons from its outer shell will easily gain electrons to complete its shell, but a
large amount of energy is required to free any of its electrons. An atom having a relatively small number
of electrons in its outer shell in comparison to the number of electrons required to fill the shell will easily
lose these valence electrons. The valence shell always refers to the outermost shell.
