Although avionics systems perform many functions, there are three elements common to most systems: data
buses, displays, and power. Data buses are the signal interfaces that lead to the high degree of integration found
today in many modern avionics systems. Displays are the primary form of crew interface with the aircraft and,
in an indirect sense, through the display of synoptic information also aid in the integration of systems. Power,
of course, is the life blood of all electronics.
