This chapter focuses on two major issues pertaining to multi-
media systems: (1) storage and encoding standards for image
and video data and (2) content-based indexing and retrieval of
multimedia data. First, the chapter brieï¬‚y outlines theoretical
foundations of image and video compression and then explores
some widely used compression and encoding standards for
multimedia. Content-based indexing and retrieval of multi-
media is an emerging research area that has received wide
attention from the research community over the past decade.
This chapter surveys the domain of content-based indexing and
retrieval for image and video data in depth. Issues, such as low-
level feature-based modeling, dimensionality reduction, and
relevance feedback, are discussed. Video is normally thought
of as a sequence of images, but the sheer size of the data yields an
altogether different set of problems to be addressed. In this
context, issues, such as temporal segmentation, video summar-
ization, and high-level semantic modeling, are discussed.
