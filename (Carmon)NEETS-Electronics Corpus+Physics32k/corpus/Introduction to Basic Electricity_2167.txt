The earth itself is a huge magnet (Figure 18-2). 
The earth’s magnetic north and south poles are situ-
ated close to the geographic North and South Poles. 
If a bar magnet is suspended, the magnet aligns in a 
north–south direction, with one end pointing toward 
the North Pole of the earth and the other toward the 
South Pole. This is the principle behind the compass. 
It is also the reason the two ends of the magnet are 
called the north pole and the south pole.
