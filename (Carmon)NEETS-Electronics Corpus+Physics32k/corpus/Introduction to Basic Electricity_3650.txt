Figure 36-12 shows the current flow during the 
 positive alternation of the input signal. Current flows 
from the bottom of the secondary side of the trans-
former,  up  through  diode  D4,  through  the  load, 
through diode D2, to the top of the secondary of the 
transformer. The entire voltage is dropped across the 
load.
