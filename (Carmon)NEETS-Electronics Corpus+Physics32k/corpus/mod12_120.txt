A simple, single-tube cw transmitter can be made by coupling the output of an oscillator directly to 
an antenna (figure 1-28). The primary purpose of the oscillator is to develop an rf voltage which has a 
constant frequency and is immune to outside factors which may cause its frequency to shift. The output of 
this simple transmitter is controlled by placing a telegraph key at point K in series with the voltage 
supply. Since the plate supply is interrupted when the key is open, the circuit oscillates only as long as the 
key is closed. Although the transmitter shown uses a Colpitts oscillator, any of the oscillators previously 
described in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits can be 
used.
