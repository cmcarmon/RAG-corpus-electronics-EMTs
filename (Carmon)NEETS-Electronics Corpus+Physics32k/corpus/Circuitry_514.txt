 
The  number  of  individual  lines  present  within  the 
address  bus  and  data  bus  depends  upon  the 
particular microprocessor employed. Signals on all 
lines, no matter whether they are used for address, 
data, or control, can exist in only two basic states: 
logic 0 (low) or logic 1 (high). Data and addresses 
are represented by binary numbers (a sequence of 
1s and 0s) that appear respectively on the data and 
address bus. 
  Many  microprocessors  designed  for  control  and 
instrumentation  applications  make  use  of  an  8-bit 
data bus and a 16-bit address bus. Others have data 
and address buses which can operate with as many 
as 128-bits at a time. 
  The largest binary number that can appear on an 
8-bit data bus corresponds to the condition when all 
eight  lines  are  at  logic  1.  Therefore  the  largest 
value of data that can be present on the bus at any 
instant  of  time  is  equivalent  to  the  binary  number 
11111111  (or  255).  Similarly,  most  the  highest 
address that can appear on a  16-bit address bus is 
1111111111111111  (or  65,535). The  full  range  of 
data  values
