If, for example, the RC time constant is chosen to be ten times the period of the
sine wave, the peak-to-peak ripple will be 10% of Vp, the peak of the input sine
wave. The DC voltage from the rectifier is the average value of vC. This can be
found by inspection of the vC waveform in Figure 16.12, again, assuming that
the transient continues for the complete period of the sine wave:
