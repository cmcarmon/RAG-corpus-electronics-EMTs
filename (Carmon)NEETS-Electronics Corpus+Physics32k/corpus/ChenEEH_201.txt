Circuit nonlinearity is often a desirable design feature. Many
electronic circuits are designed to employ the nonlinear behav-
ior of their components. The nonlinearity of the circuits’
elements is exploited to provide functionality that could not
be achieved with linear circuit elements. For example, non-
linear circuit elements are essential building blocks in many
well-known electronic circuits, such as bistable circuits, ﬂip-
ﬂops, static shift registers, static RAM cells,
latch circuits,
oscillators, and Schmitt triggers: they all require nonlinear
elements to function properly. The global behavior of these
circuits differs from the behavior of ampliﬁers or logic gates in
a fundamental way: they must possess multiple, yet isolated,
direct current (dc) operating points (also called equilibrium
points). This is possible only if a nonlinear element (such as a
transistor) is employed.
