The current to the respective destinations is I(A) = n(A)q, I(B) = n(B)q, where q is the charge of an electron,
so that I(A)/I(S) = p and I(B)/I(S) = 1 – p. Using the binomial model, the average numbers of successes are
E[n(A)] = n(S)p and E[n(B)] = n(S)(1 – p). The variance is Var(n(A)) = n(S)p(1 – p) = Var(n(B)) (from the
binomial formula for variance). Therefore, substitution yields
