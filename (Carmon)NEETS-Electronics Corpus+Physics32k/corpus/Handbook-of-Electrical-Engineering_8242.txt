In some data acquisition applications the data acquisition module is a plugged-in card in a computer, which
is installed far away from the process. In such cases, transducers—the process sensing elements—are connected
to the data acquisition module using transmission lines or a radio link. In the latter case a complete demodu-
lating unit is required at the input. When transmission lines are used in the interconnection, care must be taken
to minimize electromagnetic interference since transmission lines pick up noise easily. In the case of a single-
ended transducer output conﬁguration, a single wire is adequate for the signal transmission, but a common
ground must be established between the two ends as given in Fig. 84.3(a). For the transducers that have common
mode  outputs,  a  shielded  twisted  pair  of  wires  will  carry  the  signal.  In  this  case,  the  shield,  the  transducer’s
encasing chassis, and the data acquisition module’s reference may be connected to the same ground as shown
in Fig. 84.3(c). In high-speed applications the transmission line impedance should be matched with the output
impedance of the transducer in order to prevent reﬂected traveling waves. If the transducer output is not strong
enough to transmit for a long distance, then it is best to amplify it before transmission.
