Commercially Available Device Simulation Packages
The classical approach is the most commonly used procedure since it is the easiest to implement and, in most
cases, the fastest technique. Simulators based on the classical approach are available in two-dimensional forms
like FEDAS, HESPER, PISCES-II, PISCES-2B, MINIMOS, and BAMBI or three-dimensional forms like TRA-
NAL, SIERRA, FIELDAY, DAVINCI, and CADDETH.
