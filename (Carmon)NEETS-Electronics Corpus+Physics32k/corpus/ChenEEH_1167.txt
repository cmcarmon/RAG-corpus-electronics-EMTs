One of the most important attributes of any system is its
reliability. It is imperative to design reliability into complex
chips even more carefully as the chip functionality increases
almost without limit. This important issue was addressed by
Kang (2000) with emphasis on incorporating reliability from
early design phases rather than treating reliability assurance as
a back-end manufacturing process. As computer-aided design
(CAD) tools have played key roles in developing integrated
circuits and systems, new reliability analysis tools need to be
developed and used in SOC development. For more than a
decade, new CAD capabilities have been developed with reli-
ability focus, in particular to address reliability concerns about
hot carrier-induced degradation of circuits, electromigration,
electrostatic discharge (ESD), cross talk, leakage currents, and
high-power dissipation.
