{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}_{FK}}
is the Froude–Krylov force,

w




{\displaystyle S_{w}}
is the wetted surface of the floating body,




p


{\displaystyle p}
is the pressure in the undisturbed waves and







n

{\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
the body's normal vector pointing into the water.
In the simplest case the formula may be expressed as the product of the wetted surface area (A) of the floating body, and the dynamic pressure acting from the waves on the body:

ρ

{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to the earth’s gravity (9.81 m/s²)




H


{\displaystyle H}
is the wave height from crest to trough.
