Let's take another look at the circuit in figure 1-15(B). We found that the positive charge on the grid
caused more plate current to flow. However, when the grid becomes positive, it begins to act like a small
plate. It draws a few electrons from the space charge. These electrons flow from the cathode across the
gap to the positive grid, and back through the external grid circuit to the cathode. This flow is known as
grid current. In some tube applications, grid current is desired. In others it is relatively harmless, while in
some, grid current causes problems and must be eliminated.
