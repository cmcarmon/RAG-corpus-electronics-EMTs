Paramotor noise relative to an observer depends on distance, loudness, frequency and timbre of the power unit. Most noise comes from the propeller and slow rpm is perceived as the quietest. Pilots mitigate their sound impact by leaving a noise-sensitive area at low power, keeping the farthest practice distance away, and reducing time spent near the area.
