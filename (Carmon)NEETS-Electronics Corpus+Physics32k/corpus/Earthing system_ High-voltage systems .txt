In high-voltage networks (above 1 kV), which are far less accessible to the general public, the focus of earthing system design is less on safety and more on reliability of supply, reliability of protection, and impact on the equipment in presence of a short circuit. Only the magnitude of phase-to-ground short circuits, which are the most common, is significantly affected with the choice of earthing system, as the current path is mostly closed through the earth. Three-phase HV/MV power transformers, located in distribution substations, are the most common source of supply for distribution networks, and type of grounding of their neutral determines the earthing system.
There are five types of neutral earthing:
Solid-earthed neutral
Unearthed neutral
Resistance-earthed neutral
Low-resistance earthing
High-resistance earthing

Reactance-earthed neutral
Using earthing transformers (such as the Zigzag transformer)
