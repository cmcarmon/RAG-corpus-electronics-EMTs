The bearing to a target may be referenced to true north or to your own ship. Bearing referenced to
true north is TRUE BEARING and bearing referenced to your ship is RELATIVE BEARING, as shown
in the illustration. The bearing angle is obtained by moving the antenna to the point of maximum signal
return.
