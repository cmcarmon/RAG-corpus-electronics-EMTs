â€¢ Time-invariant versus time-varying systems. When the parameters of a control system are
stationary with respect to time during the operation of the system, the system is known
as a time-invariant system. Even though a time-varying system without nonlinearity is
still a linear system, the analysis and design of such a class of systems are generally
much more complex than that of linear time-invariant systems.
