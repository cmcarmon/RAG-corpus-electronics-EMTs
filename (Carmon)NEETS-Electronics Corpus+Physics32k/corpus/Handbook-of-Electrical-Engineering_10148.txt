Example.  Consider a planar arm with two degrees of freedom, shown in Fig. 101.15. For simplicity, we assume
that the masses m1 and m2 of the links are represented by point masses at the end of the links. The link lengths
are  l1  and  l2,  respectively.  The  variables q1  and q2  are  the  joint  angles. We  know  that  the  kinetic  energy  of  a
mass m  moving  at  a  linear  velocity  v  is  given  by  1/2 mv2  and  the  potential  energy  associated  with  a  mass m
located at a height h in a gravitational Ô¨Åeld is given by mgh, where g is the gravitational constant.
