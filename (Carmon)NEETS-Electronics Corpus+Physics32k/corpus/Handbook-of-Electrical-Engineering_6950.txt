Let both processes be ws with zero means, so the covariance coincides with the correlation function. We say
that two ws processes X(t) and Y(t) are jointly ws whenever RXY(t,t + t) = RXY(t). In case Y(t) is the output of
a ﬁlter with impulse response h(t),we can ﬁnd the cross-correlation RXY(t) between the input and output via
