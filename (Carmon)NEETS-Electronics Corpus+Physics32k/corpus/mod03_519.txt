The solenoid coil should then be checked for opens, shorts, and proper resistance with an ohmmeter.
If the solenoid coil is open, current cannot flow through it and the magnetic field is lost. A short results in
fewer turns and higher current in the coil. The net result of a short is a weak magnetic field. A high-
resistance coil will reduce coil current and also result in a weak magnetic field. A weak magnetic field
