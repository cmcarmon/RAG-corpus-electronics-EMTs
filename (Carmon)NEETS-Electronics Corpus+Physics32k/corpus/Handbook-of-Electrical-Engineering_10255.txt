Figure  102.3  is  a  top-level  view  of  the  U.S. Air  Force  F-22 Advanced  Tactical  Fighter  avionics.  Like  many
other aircraft, the F-22 architecture is hybrid, part federated and part integrated. The left side of the ﬁgure is
the highly integrated portion, dominated by the two Common Integrated Processors (CIPs) that process, fuse,
and distribute signals received from the various sensors on the far left. The keys to this portion of the architecture
are the Processor Interconnect (PI) buses within the CIPs and the High Speed Data Buses (HSDBs). (There
are provisions for a third CIP as the F-22 avionics grow in capability.) The right side of the ﬁgure shows the
federated systems including the Inertial Reference, Stores Management, Integrated Flight and Propulsion Con-
trol,  and  Vehicle  Management  systems  and  the  interface  of  the  latter  two  to  the  Integrated  Vehicle  System
Control. The keys to this portion of the architecture are the triple or quadruple redundant AS 15531 (formerly
MIL-STD-1553) command/response two-way data buses.
