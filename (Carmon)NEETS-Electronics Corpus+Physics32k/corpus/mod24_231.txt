Optical fibers are thin cylindrical dielectric (non-conductive) waveguides used to send light energy
for communication. Optical fibers consist of three parts: the core, the cladding, and the coating or buffer.
The choice of optical fiber materials and fiber design depends on operating conditions and intended
application. Optical fibers are protected from the environment by incorporating the fiber into some type of
cable structure. Cable strength members and outer jackets protect the fiber. Optical cable structure and
material composition depend on the conditions of operation and the intended application.
