By analogy, we can derive Ô¨Ånite-difference equations for
equations 9.9a to 9.9c to time-step Hx, Hy, and Hz. Here sH
represents a magnetic loss term on the right-hand side of each
equation, which is estimated using a semi-implicit procedure
analogous to equation 9.18. Referring again to Figures 9.1 and
