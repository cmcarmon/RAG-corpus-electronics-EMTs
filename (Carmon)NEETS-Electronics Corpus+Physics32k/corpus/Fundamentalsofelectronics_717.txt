Problem 5.29: Digital AM Receiver
Thinking that digital implementations are always better, our clever engineer wants to design a digital AM
receiver. The receiver would bandpass the received signal, pass the result through an A/D converter, perform
all the demodulation with digital signal processing systems, and end with a D/A converter to produce the
analog message signal. Assume in this problem that the carrier frequency is always a large even multiple of
the message signalâ€™s bandwidth W .
