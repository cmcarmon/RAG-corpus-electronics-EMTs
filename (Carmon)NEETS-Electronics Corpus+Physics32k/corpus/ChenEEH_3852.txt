We can see clearly that the energy is highly concentrated in
the low-frequency coefﬁcients. Therefore, it is natural to think
of a lossy image compression system in which only the coefﬁ-
cients having higher energies are encoded. To get a feeling of
this, one can look at Figure 4.22. There, the LENA image has
been divided into 8  8 blocks, and the DCT of each block was
