Electrical ﬁlters are circuits designed to shape the magnitude
and/or phase spectrum of an input signal to generate a desired
response at the output. Thus, a frequency range can be deﬁned
as the passband where the input signal should be transmitted
through the ﬁlter undistorted and unattenuated (or possibly
ampliﬁed); stopbands require transmission to be blocked or
the signal to be at least highly attenuated. In the frequency
domain, the transmission characteristic is described by the
transfer function:
