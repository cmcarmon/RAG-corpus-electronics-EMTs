A magnet may also become weakened from loss of flux. Thus when storing magnets, one should
always try to avoid excess leakage of magnetic flux. A horseshoe magnet should always be stored with a
keeper, a soft iron bar used to join the magnetic poles. By using the keeper while the magnet is being
stored, the magnetic flux will continuously circulate through the magnet and not leak off into space.
