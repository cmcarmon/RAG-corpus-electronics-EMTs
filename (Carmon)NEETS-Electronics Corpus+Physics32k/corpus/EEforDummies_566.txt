Rectifying AC
Figure 9­6 shows a circuit with a silicon diode, a resistor, and an AC power 
source. Note the orientation of the diode in the circuit: Its anode (positive 
end) is connected to the power source. The diode conducts current when 
it’s forward‐biased, but not if it’s reverse‐biased. When the AC source is posi­
tive (and provides at least 0.7 V to forward‐bias the silicon diode), the diode 
conducts current; when the AC source is less than 0.7 V, the diode does not 
conduct current. The output voltage is a clipped version of the input voltage; 
only the portion of the input signal that is greater than 0.7 V passes through 
to output.
