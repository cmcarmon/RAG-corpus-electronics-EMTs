A Wien-bridge	oscillator is a two-stage amplifier 
with a lead-lag network and voltage divider  (Figure 39-12).  
The lead-lag network consists of a  series RC network 
(R1C1) and a parallel network. It is called a lead-lag 
network because the output phase angle leads for 
some frequencies and lags for other frequencies. At 
the resonant frequency, the phase shift is 0°, and the 
output voltage is maximum. Resistors R2 and R4 form 
the voltage divider network, which is used to develop 
the degenerative feedback. Regenerative feedback is 
applied to the base, and degenerative feedback is ap-
plied to the emitter of oscillator transistor Q1. The out-
put of transistor Q1 is capacitively coupled to the base 
of transistor Q2, where it is amplified and shifted and 
rotated 180°. The output is coupled by capacitor C4 to 
the bridge network.
