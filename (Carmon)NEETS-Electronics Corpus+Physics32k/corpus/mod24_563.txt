Reflective and nonreflective faults occurring at distances other than fiber joint locations identify
fiber breaks, cracks, or microbends. A fiber break produces a reflective fault because fiber breaks result in
complete fiber separation. Fiber cracks and microbends generally produce nonreflective faults.
