Cache  sizes  have  been  steadily  increasing  on  personal  computers  and  workstations.  Intel  Pentium-based
personal  computers  come  with  8  Kbyte  each  of  instruction  and  data  caches.  Two  of  the  Pentium  chip  sets,
manufactured by Intel and OPTi, allow level-two caches ranging from 256 to 512 Kbyte and 64 Kbyte to 2 Mbyte,
respectively. The newer Pentium Pro systems also have 8 Kbyte, ﬁrst-level instruction and data caches, but they
also  have  either  a  256  Kbyte  or  a  512  Kbyte  second-level  cache  on  the  same  module  as  the  processor  chip.
Higher-end workstations—such as DEC Alpha 21164-based systems—are conﬁgured with substantially more
cache. The 21164 also has 8 Kbyte, ﬁrst-level instruction and data caches. Its second-level cache is entirely on-
chip, and is 96 Kbyte. The third-level cache is off-chip, and can have a size ranging from 1 to 64 Mbyte.
