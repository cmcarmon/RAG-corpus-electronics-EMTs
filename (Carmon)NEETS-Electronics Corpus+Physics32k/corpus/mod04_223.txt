Solderingâ€”The basic skills required to solder terminal lugs, splices, and electrical connectors are 
covered in this area. Prior to any soldering operation, the items to be soldered must be cleaned; they will 
not adhere to dirty, greasy, or oxidized surfaces. The next step is the "tinning" process. This process is 
accomplished by coating the material to be soldered with a bright coat of solder. The wire to be soldered 
must be stripped to 1/32 inch longer than the depth of the solder cup of the terminal, splice, or connector 
to which it is to be soldered. This is to prevent burning the insulation. It also allows the wire to flex at the 
stress point. When you tin the wire, it should be done to one-half of the stripped length. When soldering a 
connection, take precaution to prevent movement of the parts while the solder is cooling. A "fractured 
solder" joint will result if this precaution is not taken.
