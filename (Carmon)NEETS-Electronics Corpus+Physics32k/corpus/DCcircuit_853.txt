As the water tank level changes, the ﬂoat will move. As the ﬂoat moves, the potentiometer
wiper will correspondingly be moved, dividing a different proportion of the battery voltage to
go across the two-conductor cable and on to the level indicator. As a result, the voltage received
by the indicator will be representative of the level of water in the storage tank.
