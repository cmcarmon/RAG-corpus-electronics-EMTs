A bus is a common wire connecting various points in a circuit; examples are the ground bus
and power bus. The data bus carries digital information. A data bus is usually a group
of parallel wires connecting diﬀerent parts of a circuit with each individual wire carrying a
diﬀerent logic signal. The data bus is connected to the inputs of several gates and to the
outputs of several gates. You cannot connect directly the outputs of normal gates. For this
purpose three-state output logic is commonly used but will not be discussed here.
