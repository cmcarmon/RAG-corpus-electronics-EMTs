In contrast to INES, which comes with 200-page user manual, the definition of the NAMS scale is rather straightforward:
NAMS = log10(20 Ã— R)
with R being the radioactivity being released in terabecquerels, calculated as the equivalent dose of iodine-131. Furthermore, only the atmospheric release affecting the area outside the nuclear facility is considered for calculating the NAMS, giving a NAMS score of 0 to all incidents which do not affect the outside. The factor of 20 assures that both the INES and the NAMS scales reside in a similar range, aiding a comparison between accidents. It is noteworthy that an atmospheric release of any radioactivity will only occur in the INES categories 4 to 7, while the NAMS is does not have such a limitation.
