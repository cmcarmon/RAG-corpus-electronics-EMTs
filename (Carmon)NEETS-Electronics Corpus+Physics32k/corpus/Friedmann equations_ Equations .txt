There are two independent Friedmann equations for modeling a homogeneous, isotropic universe. The first is:

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\dot {a}}^{2}+kc^{2}}{a^{2}}}={\frac {8\pi G\rho +\Lambda c^{2}}{3}}}

which is derived from the 00 component of Einstein's field equations. The second is:

which is derived from the first together with the trace of Einstein's field equations.



a

a




{\displaystyle H\equiv {\frac {\dot {a}}{a}}}
is the Hubble parameter. G, Λ, and c are universal constants (G is Newton's gravitational constant, Λ is the cosmological constant, and c is the speed of light in vacuum). k is constant throughout a particular solution, but may vary from one solution to another. a, H, ρ, and p are functions of time. ρ, and p are the density and pressure, respectively.

{\displaystyle R={\frac {6}{c^{2}a^{2}}}({\ddot {a}}a+{\dot {a}}^{2}+kc^{2})}
in the Friedmann model. We see that in the Friedmann equations, a(t) depends only on ρ, p, Λ, and intrinsic curvature k. It does not depend on which coordinate system we chose for spatial slices. There are two commonly used choices for a and k which describe the same physics:
k = +1, 0 or −1 depending on whether the shape of the universe is a closed 3-sphere, flat (i.e. Euclidean space) or an open 3-hyperboloid, respectively. If k = +1, then



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the radius of curvature of the universe. If k = 0, then



a


{\displaystyle a}
may be fixed to any arbitrary positive number at one particular time. If k = −1, then (loosely speaking) one can say that



i

{\displaystyle a}

a is the scale factor which is taken to be 1 at the present time.



k


{\displaystyle k}
is the spatial curvature when



a

{\displaystyle a=1}
(i.e. today). If the shape of the universe is hyperspherical and




R

{\displaystyle R_{t}}
is the radius of curvature (




R

{\displaystyle R_{0}}
in the present-day), then



a

R

{\displaystyle a=R_{t}/R_{0}}

k


{\displaystyle k}

k

k


{\displaystyle k}

Using the first equation, the second equation can be re-expressed as

{\displaystyle {\dot {H}}+H^{2}={\frac {\ddot {a}}{a}}=-{\frac {4\pi G}{3}}\left(\rho +{\frac {3p}{c^{2}}}\right).}

The simplified form of the second equation is invariant under this transformation.
The Hubble parameter can change over time if other parts of the equation are time dependent (in particular the mass density, the vacuum energy, or the spatial curvature). Evaluating the Hubble parameter at the present time yields Hubble's constant which is the proportionality constant of Hubble's law. Applied to a fluid with a given equation of state, the Friedmann equations yield the time evolution and geometry of the universe as a function of the fluid density.
Some cosmologists call the second of these two equations the Friedmann acceleration equation and reserve the term Friedmann equation for only the first equation.
