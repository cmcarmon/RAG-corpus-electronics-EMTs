Small  e.m.f.  generated  at  the  junction  between  two 
dissimilar  metals  (e.g.  copper  and  constantan).  Requires 
reference  junction  and  compensated  cables  for  accurate 
measurement. 
Fine  wire  resistive  element  is  wound  around  a  circular 
former. Slider attached to the control shaft makes contact 
with the resistive  element.  A stable d.c. voltage source is 
connected  across  the  ends  of  the  potentiometer.  Voltage 
appearing at the slider will then be proportional to angular 
position.
