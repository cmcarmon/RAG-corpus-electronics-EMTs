**RG2] = 10 MW. If
the JFET gate current is speciﬁed as 1 nA (max), and for good bias stability the change in gate voltage due to
**RG2] is given by IG ·
the gate current should not exceed *VP
**RG2] < 0.4 V/1 nA = 0.4 GW = 400 MW. Therefore RG1 and RG2 can each be allowed
[RG1
to be as large as 800 MW, and very large values for Rin can thus be obtained. At higher frequencies the input
capacitance Cin must be considered, and Cin will ultimately limit the input impedance of the circuit. Since the
input capacitance of the FET will be comparable to that of the BJT, the advantage of the FET source follower
over the BJT emitter follower from the standpoint of input impedance will be obtained only at relatively low
frequencies.
