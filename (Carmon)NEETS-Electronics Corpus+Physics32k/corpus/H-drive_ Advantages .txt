Each wheel station has independent suspension.
Greater ground clearance than conventional axles, as there is no central housing for the differential and final drive.
Lower unsprung weight as only the halfshafts are carried, not the centre differential of an axle.
Only one differential is required; however, this also requires that final drive to transmit all of the vehicle's torque.
Losing traction with one wheel still retains traction for the other wheels on that side; in effect, a longitudinal differential lock is permanently engaged. This does have the downside of driveline windup.
H-drive is not commonly used for 4 wheel vehicles, as it is relatively complicated for small vehicles. It has been used most widely for military 6Ã—6 chassis in the West. Vehicles of the Warsaw Pact, such as the Tatra 813 and MAZ-535 series, were instead based on narrow backbone chassis with a central propeller shaft.
