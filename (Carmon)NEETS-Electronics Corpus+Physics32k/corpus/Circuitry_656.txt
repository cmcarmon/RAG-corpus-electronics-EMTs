Sensitivity 
 
The  sensitivity  of  an  analogue  meter  may  be 
expressed  in  several  ways.  One  is  to  specify  the 
basic  full-scale  deflection  (f.s.d.)  current  of  the 
moving coil meter. This is typically 50 µA or less. 
An alternative method is that of quoting an ohms-
per-volt  rating.  This  is,  in  effect,  the  resistance 
presented  by  the  meter  when  switched  to  the  1  V 
range. 
  The 
inversely 
proportional to the basic full-scale sensitivity of the 
meter movement and, to determine the resistance of 
a meter  on  a  particular  voltage  range,  it  is  only 
necessary  to  multiply  the  range  setting  by  the 
‘ohms-per-volt’  rating.  Table  14.2  shows  how 
meter  f.s.d.  and  ohms-per-volt  are  related.  From 
this we can conclude that: 
Meter f.s.d. =
