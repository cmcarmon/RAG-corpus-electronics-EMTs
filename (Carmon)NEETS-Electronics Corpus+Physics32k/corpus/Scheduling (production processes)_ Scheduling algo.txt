Production scheduling can take a significant amount of computing power if there are a large number of tasks. Therefore, a range of short-cut algorithms (heuristics) (a.k.a. dispatching rules) are used:
Stochastic Algorithms : Economic Lot Scheduling Problem and Economic production quantity
Heuristic Algorithms : Modified due date scheduling heuristic and Shifting bottleneck heuristic
