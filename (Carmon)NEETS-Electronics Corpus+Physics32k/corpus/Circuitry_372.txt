resistance,  R1.  The  result  of  this  potential  divider 
arrangement  is  that  the  a.c.  signal  component  is 
effectively bypassed to ground. 
  Figure 7.34 shows an improved form of transistor 
amplifier in which d.c. negative feedback is used to 
stabilize the stage and compensate for variations in 
transistor  parameters,  component  values  and 
temperature  changes.  R1 and  R2 form  a  potential 
divider that determines the d.c. base potential, VB.
The  base-emitter  voltage  (VBE) is  the  difference 
between the potentials present at the base (VB ) and 
emitter  (VE).  The  potential  at  the  emitter  is 
governed by the emitter current (IE). If this current 
increases,  the  emitter  voltage  (VE ) will  increase 
and,  as  a  consequence  VBE  will  fall.  This,  in  turn, 
produces  a  reduction  in  emitter  current  which 
largely  offsets  the  original  change.  Conversely,  if 
the  emitter  current  decreases,  the  emitter  voltage 
(VE) will decrease and VBE will increase (remember 
that  VB remains  constant).  The  increase  in  bias 
results 
in  emitter  current 
compensating for the original change.
