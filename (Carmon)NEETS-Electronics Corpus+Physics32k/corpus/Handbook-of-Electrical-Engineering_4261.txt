Tracking Filter Performance
Target tracking based on processing returns from multiple CPIs generally provides a target position and velocity
estimate of greater accuracy than the single-CPI measurement accuracy delineated in Table 41.5. In principle,
the error variance of the estimated target position with the target moving at a constant velocity is approximately
m where n is the number of independent measurements processed by the track ﬁlter and sm is the single
4/n · s 2
measurement accuracy. In practice, the variance reduction factor afforded by a track ﬁlter is often limited to
about an order of magnitude because of the reasons summarized in the following paragraphs.
