You will find the main difference between low-frequency and high-frequency transmitters is the
number of frequency-multiplying stages used. Figure 2-5 shows the block diagram of the frequency-
multiplying stages of a typical Navy uhf/vhf transmitter. The oscillator in this transmitter is tunable from
18 megahertz to 32 megahertz. You have multiplier stages that increase the oscillator frequency by a
factor of 12 through successive multiplications of 2, 2, and 3.
