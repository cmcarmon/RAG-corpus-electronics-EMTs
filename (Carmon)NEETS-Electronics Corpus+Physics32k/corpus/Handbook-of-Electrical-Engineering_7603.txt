Everything one needs to know about digital devices and their interconnection can be found somewhere
in  the  data  manuals,  design  handbooks,  and  application  notes  published  by  the  device  manufacturers.
Unfortunately,  no  single  publication  has  it  all,  so  the  serious  user  should  acquire  as  large  a  collection  of
these sources as possible.
