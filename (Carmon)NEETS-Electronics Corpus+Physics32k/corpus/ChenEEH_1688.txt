Temporal Segmentation
Video data can be viewed hierarchically. At the lowest level,
video data is made up of frames; a collection of frames that
result from single camera operation depicting one event is
called a shot, and a complete unit of narration that consists
of a series of shots or a single shot taking place in a single
location and dealing with a single action deÔ¨Ånes a scene
(Monaco, 1977). CBVIR systems rely on the visual content at
distinct hierarchical levels of the video data. Although the basic
representation of raw video is provided in terms of a sequence
of frames, the detection of distinct shots and scenes is a
complex task.
