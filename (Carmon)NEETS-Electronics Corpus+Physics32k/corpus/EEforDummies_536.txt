Sizing up semiconductors
The atoms of semiconductor materials align themselves in a structured way, 
forming a regular, three‐dimensional pattern — a crystal — as shown in 
Figure 9­2. Atoms in the crystal are held together by a special bond, called 
a covalent bond, with each atom sharing its outermost electrons (known as 
valence electrons) with its neighbors.
