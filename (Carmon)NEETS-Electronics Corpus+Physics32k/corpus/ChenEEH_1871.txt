Over the past decade, a phenomenal growth in the develop-
ment of cellular networks around the world has occurred.
Wireless communications technology has evolved over these
years, from a simple Ô¨Årst-generation (1G) analog system sup-
porting only voice (e.g., AMPS, NMT, TACS, etc.) to the
current second-generation (2G) digital systems (e.g., GSM,
IS-95, IS-136, etc.) supporting voice and low-rate data. We
are still evolving towards the third-generation (3G) digital
system (e.g., IMT-2000, cdma2000 etc.) supporting multi-
media (Garg, 1999).
