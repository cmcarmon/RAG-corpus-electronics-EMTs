Notice that the lumped circuit simplification is analogous to the point-mass
simplification in Newton’s laws. The lumped circuit abstraction represents the
relevant properties of lumped elements using algebraic symbols. For exam-
ple, we use R for the resistance of a resistor. Other values of interest, such
as currents I and voltages V, are related through simple functions. The
ease of using algebraic equations in place of Maxwell’s equations to design
and analyze complicated circuits will become much clearer in the following
chapters.
