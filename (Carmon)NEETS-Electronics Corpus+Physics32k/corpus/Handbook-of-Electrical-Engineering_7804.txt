FIGURE 80.22  Micrographs of several types of optical storage media. The tracks are straight and narrow (track pitch =
1.6 mm), with an orientation angle of . –45(cid:176). (A) Ablative, write-once tellurium alloy. (B) Ablative, write-once organic dye.
(C) Amorphous-to-crystalline, write-once phase-change alloy GaSb. (D) Erasable, amorphous magneto-optic alloy GdTbFe.
(E)  Erasable,  crystalline-to-amorphous  phase-change  tellurium  alloy.  (F)  Read-only  CD-audio,  injection-molded  from
polycarbonate with a nickel stamper. (Source: Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th ed., vol. A14, Weinheim:
