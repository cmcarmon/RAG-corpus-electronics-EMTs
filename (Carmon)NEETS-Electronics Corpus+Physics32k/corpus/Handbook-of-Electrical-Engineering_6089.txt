Economic dispatch uses optimization techniques to determine the level of power each generator (unit) must
supply  to  the  system  in  order  to  meet  the  demand.  Each  unit  must  have  its  generating  costs,  which  will  be
nonlinear functions of energy, deÔ¨Åned along with the units operational maximum and minimum power limits.
The transmission losses of the system must also be taken into account to ensure an overall minimum cost.
