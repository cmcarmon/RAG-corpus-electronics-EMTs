As mentioned at the beginning, the GHY term is required to ensure the path integral (a la Hawking et al.) for quantum gravity has the correct composition properties.
This older approach to path-integral quantum gravity had a number of difficulties and unsolved problems. The starting point in this approach is Feynman's idea that one can represent the amplitude

Σ

{\displaystyle \langle g_{2},\phi _{2},\Sigma _{2}|g_{1},\phi _{1},\Sigma _{1}\rangle }

to go from the state with metric




g

1




{\displaystyle g_{1}}
and matter fields




ϕ

1




{\displaystyle \phi _{1}}
on a surface




Σ

1




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
to a state with metric




g

2




{\displaystyle g_{2}}
and matter fields




ϕ

2




{\displaystyle \phi _{2}}
on a surface




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
, as a sum over all field configurations



g


{\displaystyle g}
and



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
which take the boundary values of the fields on the surfaces




Σ

1




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
and




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
. We write

)


{\displaystyle \langle g_{2},\phi _{2},\Sigma _{2}|g_{1},\phi _{1},\Sigma _{1}\rangle =\int {\mathcal {D}}[g,\phi ]\exp(iS[g,\phi ])}

where





D


[
g
,
ϕ
]


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {D}}[g,\phi ]}
is a measure on the space of all field configurations



g


{\displaystyle g}
and



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
,



S
[
g
,
ϕ
]


{\displaystyle S[g,\phi ]}
is the action of the fields, and the integral is taken over all fields which have the given values on




Σ

1




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
and




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
.
It is argued that one need only specify the three-dimensional induced metric



h


{\displaystyle h}
on the boundary.
Now consider the situation where one makes the transition from metric




h

1




{\displaystyle h_{1}}
, on a surface




Σ

1




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
, to a metric




h

2




{\displaystyle h_{2}}
, on a surface




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
and then on to a metric




h

3




{\displaystyle h_{3}}
on a later surface




Σ

3




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{3}}

One would like to have the usual composition rule




⟨

h

=

∑

{\displaystyle \langle h_{3},\Sigma _{3}|h_{1},\Sigma _{1}\rangle =\sum _{h_{2}}\langle h_{3},\Sigma _{3}|h_{2},\Sigma _{2}\rangle \langle h_{2},\Sigma _{2}|h_{1},\Sigma _{1}\rangle }

expressing that the amplitude to go from the initial to final state to be obtained by summing over all states on the intermediate surface




Σ

{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
.
Let




g

1




{\displaystyle g_{1}}
be the metric between




Σ

1




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{1}}
and




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
and




g

2




{\displaystyle g_{2}}
be the metric between




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
and




Σ

3




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{3}}
. Although the induced metric of




g

1




{\displaystyle g_{1}}
and




g

2




{\displaystyle g_{2}}
will agree on




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
, the normal derivative of




g

1




{\displaystyle g_{1}}
at




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
will not in general be equal to that of




g

2




{\displaystyle g_{2}}
at




Σ

2




{\displaystyle \Sigma _{2}}
. Taking the implications of this into account, it can then be shown that the composition rule will hold if and only if we include the GHY boundary term.
In the next section it is demonstrated how this path integral approach to quantum gravity leads to the concept of black hole temperature and intrinsic quantum mechanical entropy.
