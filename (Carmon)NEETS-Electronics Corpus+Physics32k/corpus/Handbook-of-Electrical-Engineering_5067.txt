Chemical measurands include ion concentration, chemical composition, rate of reactions, reduction-oxidation
potentials, and gas concentration. The last column of Table 56.1 lists some of the transduction mechanisms
that have been, or could be, employed in chemical sensing. Two examples of chemical sensors are described
