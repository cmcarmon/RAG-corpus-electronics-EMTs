Dislocation scattering in semiconductor materials is often ignored because it becomes signiﬁcant only for
dislocation densities Ndis > 108 cm–2 (note that this is an arreal, not volume, density). Such high densities are
rare in most semiconductor devices, such as those fabricated from Si or GaAs, but are indeed quite common
in  devices  based  on  GaN  or  other  materials  that  involve  mismatched  substrates.  In  GaN  grown  on  Al2O3
(sapphire),  vertical  threading  dislocations,  typically  of  concentration  1010  cm–2  or  higher,  emanate  from  the
interface up to the surface, and horizontally moving electrons or holes experience a scattering characterized by
