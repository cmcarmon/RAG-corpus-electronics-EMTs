The compressed air/nitrogen heating tool (figure 2-16) is a new tool in the fleet and was designed as 
a portable source of heat. This tool is safe for use around fueled aircraft because an open heating element 
is not required. The compressed air/nitrogen heating tool can be used on heat-shrinkable tubing.
