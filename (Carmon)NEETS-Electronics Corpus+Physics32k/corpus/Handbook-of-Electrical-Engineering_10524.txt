All major vehicle subsystems and many minor ones are now microprocessor-controlled. Embedded micropro-
cessors replace banks of relays and mechanical switches to perform functions on the vehicle and also to control
functions that did not exist prior to the advent of microprocessors. Some major vehicle subsystems have several
microprocessors handling different functions and coordinating analog and digital input and output signals.
