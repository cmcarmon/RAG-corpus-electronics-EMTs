The positive electrode of the first cell and negative electrode of the last cell then serve as the terminals of 
the battery. In this way, the voltage is 1.5 volts for each cell in the series line. There are four cells, so the 
output terminal voltage is 1.5 Ã— 4, or 6 volts. When connected to the load, 1/8 ampere flows through the 
load and each cell of the battery. This is within the capacity of each cell. Therefore, only four 
series-connected cells are needed to supply this particular load.
