In North America, starting around 1932, the ﬁrst instal-
lation of oil-ﬁlled pipe-type cables occurred. The pipe-type
cables proved to be more economical, and by 1954, the total
circuit mileage of installed pipe-type cable surpassed that of
the self-contained oil-ﬁlled cable in the United States. The ﬁrst
230-kV pipe-type cables were installed in 1956. With increas-
ing loads, neither increasing cooling nor operating voltage can
cope up with the increased dielectric losses in the oil-impreg-
nated paper dielectric. Thus, for higher operating voltage, syn-
thetic dielectrics, such as cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE)
and paper-polypropylene laminates (PPL), were introduced
and have inherently lower dielectric losses.
