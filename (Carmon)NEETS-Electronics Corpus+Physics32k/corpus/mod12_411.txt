The use of an af voltage in the detector aids the operator in distinguishing between various signals.
Since the carrier is unmodulated, the af voltage can be developed by using the heterodyne procedure
discussed in chapter 1. The procedure is to mix the incoming cw signal with locally generated
oscillations. This provides a convenient difference frequency in the af range, such as 1,000 hertz. The af
difference frequency then is rectified and smoothed by a detector. The af voltage is reproduced by a
telephone headset or a loudspeaker.
