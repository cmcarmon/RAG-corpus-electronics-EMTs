Figure 14.3.6(a), in block diagram form, illustrates a thermal noise source connected to
a matched two-port network having frequency response H (f ) and the output of the network
connected to a matched load. Figure 14.3.6(b) shows a thermal noise source represented by a
resistance R connected to an ampliﬁer with a matched input resistance. Presuming the ampliﬁer
to be noiseless, with power gain G and bandwidth B, the output noise power is
