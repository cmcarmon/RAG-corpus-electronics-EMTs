Glass fibers soon became the preferred medium for fiber optic research. Initially, the very large
losses in the optical fibers prevented coaxial cables from being replaced. Loss is the decrease in the
amount of light reaching the end of the fiber. Early fibers had losses around 1,000 dB/km making them
impractical for communications use. In 1969, several scientists concluded that impurities in the fiber
material caused the signal loss in optical fibers. The basic fiber material did not prevent the light signal
from reaching the end of the fiber. These researchers believed it was possible to reduce the losses in
optical fibers by removing the impurities. By removing the impurities, construction of low-loss optical
fibers was possible.
