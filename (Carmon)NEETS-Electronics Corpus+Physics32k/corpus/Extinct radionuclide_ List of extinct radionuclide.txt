A partial list of radionuclides not found on Earth, but for which decay products are present:
Notable isotopes with shorter lives still being produced on Earth include:
Manganese-53 and beryllium-10 are produced by cosmic ray spallation on dust in the upper atmosphere.
Uranium-236 is produced in uranium ores by neutrons from other radioisotopes.
Iodine-129 is produced from tellurium-130 by cosmic-ray muons and from cosmic ray spallation of stable xenon isotopes in the atmosphere.
Radioisotopes with half-lives shorter than one million years are also produced: for example, carbon-14 by cosmic ray production in the atmosphere (half-life 5730 years).
