Causes of hunger are related to poverty. There are inter-related issues causing hunger, which are related to economics and other factors that cause poverty. They include land rights and ownership, diversion of land use to non productive use, increasing emphasis on export oriented agriculture, inefficient agricultural practices, war, famine, drought, over fishing, poor crop yield, etc.

The basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations, which can include:
Medical reasons
Anorexia nervosa
Bulimia nervosa
Eating disorder, not otherwise specified
Celiac disease
Coma
Major depressive disorder
Diabetes mellitus
Digestive disease
Constant vomiting
Circumstantial causes
Child/ Elder/ Dependent Abuse
Famine â€“ for any reason, such as political strife and war
Excessive fasting
Poverty
The main causes of starvation are as follows:
Economy; poor people sometimes cannot buy enough foodstuffs and thereby fail to fulfill the caloric demands of the body.
Food scarcity in the society. This causes a decreased supply of food to the whole of the population, and thus mass starvation may occur.
Diseases that can cause rapid weight loss either due to the nature of the disease or the inability of the person to either eat or eat enough due to symptoms including fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The person may also be the host to a parasite such as an intestinal worm which may take a significant amount of the calories ingested by its host. This effect is exacerbated if the human host is already ingesting far less food than is required to meet their daily caloric intake needs.
Clinical conditions, such as recovering from surgery or burns, etc., in which the person may be too fatigued or incapacitated to eat enough during their period of convalescence.
