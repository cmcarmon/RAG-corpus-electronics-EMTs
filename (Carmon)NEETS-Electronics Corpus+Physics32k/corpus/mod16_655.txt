The oscilloscope you use may differ in some respects from the one just covered. Controls and
circuits may be identified by different names. Many of the circuits will be designed differently. However,
all the functions will be fundamentally the same. Before using an oscilloscope, you should carefully study
the operatorâ€™s manual that comes with it.
