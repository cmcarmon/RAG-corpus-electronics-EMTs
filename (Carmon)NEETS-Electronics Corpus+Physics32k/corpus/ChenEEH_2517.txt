In a practical design, the characteristic impedance of the
transformer and matching network depends on the type of
transmission line that dictates its achievable impedance range.
Further, the type of transmission line used gives preference to
either shunt (common voltage) or series (common current)
branch connection. In a microstrip line, for example, stubs are
best used in shuntâ€“parallel connections.
