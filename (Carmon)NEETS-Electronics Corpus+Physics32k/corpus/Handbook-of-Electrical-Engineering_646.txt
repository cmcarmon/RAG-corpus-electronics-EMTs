One way to improve the data rate is to use a multilevel modulation scheme such as those described in [8].
Alternatively,  one  can  solve  the  estimation  problem  directly  by  modifying  the  modulation  scheme  such  that
the transmitted energy for each symbol is kept constant. FM-DCSK is an example of the latter approach.
