4. Partitioning, mapping, placing, and routing (PMPR):
Partitioning is required for multichip design if it is also
necessary for multichip implementation. After design
is partitioned for an individual FPGA chip, logic for-
mulation is mapped to underlying logic cells and
placed according to the desired ﬂoor plan. Logic cells
are interconnected by an automatic routing tool. A
mapping, placing, and routing tool is provided by the
manufacturer or locally implemented and integrated to
the design ﬂow such as IRIS (Woods et al., 1997) for
faster execution time.
