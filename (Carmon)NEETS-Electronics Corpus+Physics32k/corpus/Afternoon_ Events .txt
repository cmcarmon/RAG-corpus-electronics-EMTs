Afternoon is a time when the sun is descending from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.
