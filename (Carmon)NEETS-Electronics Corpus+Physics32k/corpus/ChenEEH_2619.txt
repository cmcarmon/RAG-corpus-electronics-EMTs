Ferrite phase shifters are usually two-port devices that pro-
vide a variable phase shift of the transmission path by changing
the bias Ô¨Åeld of the ferrite. There are many types that are
characterized by their microwave performances, their switch-
ing characteristics, and their control characteristics. These
include waveguides and planar circuits, transverse and longi-
tudinal biasing, latching and continuous phase variation, and
reciprocal and nonreciprocal operations. Special devices are
also developed with the ferrite phase shifters, such as gyrators
that have a 1808 differential phase shift in the forward direc-
tion but no phase shift in the reverse direction.
