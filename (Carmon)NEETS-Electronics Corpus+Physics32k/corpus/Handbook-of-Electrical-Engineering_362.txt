One of the most ubiquitous of electrical instruments is the induction-type watthour meter, which measures
the energy delivered to a load. Every customer of an electrical utility has one, for example. In this instance the
pivoted coil is replaced by a rotating conducting (usually aluminum) disk as shown in Fig. 3.27. An induced
eddy current in the disk replaces the pivoted coil current interaction with the load-current-established magnetic
Ô¨Åeld. After compensating for the less-than-ideal nature of the electrical elements making up the meter as just
described,  the  result  is  that  the  disk  rotates  at  a  rate  proportional  to  the  average  power  to  the  load  and  the
rotational count is proportional to the energy delivered to the load.
