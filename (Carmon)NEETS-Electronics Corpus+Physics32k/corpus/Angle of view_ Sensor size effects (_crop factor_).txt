As noted above, a camera's angle of view depends not only on the lens, but also on the sensor used. Digital sensors are usually smaller than 35mm film, causing the lens to usually behave as a longer focal length lens would behave, and have a narrower angle of view than with 35mm film, by a constant factor for each sensor (called the crop factor). In everyday digital cameras, the crop factor can range from around 1 (professional digital SLRs), to 1.6 (mid-market SLRs), to around 3 to 6 for compact cameras. So a standard 50mm lens for 35mm photography acts like a 50mm standard "film" lens even on a professional digital SLR, but would act closer to an 75mm (1.5 x 50mm Nikon) or 80mm lens (1.6 x 50mm Canon) on many mid-market DSLRs, and the 40 degree angle of view of a standard 50mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to a 28-35mm lens on many digital SLRs.
The table below shows the horizontal, vertical and diagonal angles of view, in degrees, when used with 22.2 mm Ã— 14.8 mm format (that is the common mid-market DSLR APS-C frame size) and a diagonal of 26.7 mm.
