It is important to note that a logic variable (such 
as  A or  B) can  exist  in  only  two  states  variously 
(and  interchangeably)  described  as  true  or  false, 
asserted or non-asserted, 1 or 0, etc. The two states 
are  mutually  exclusive  and  there  are  no  ‘in 
between’ conditions.  
 
Truth tables 
 
We  often  use  tables  to  describe  logic  functions. 
These tables show all possible logical combinations 
and they are called truth tables. The columns in a 
truth table correspond to the input variables and an 
extra column is used to show the resulting output. 
The rows of the truth tables show all possible states 
of the input variables. Thus, if there are two input 
variables (A and B) there will be four possible input 
states, as follows: 
 
A = 0,  B = 0
A = 0,  B = 1
A = 1,  B = 0
A = 1,  B = 1
