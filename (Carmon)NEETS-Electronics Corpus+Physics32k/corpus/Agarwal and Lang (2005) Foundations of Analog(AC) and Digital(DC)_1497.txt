A common example of the use of memory involves the digital calculator.
Suppose we wish to compute the value of the expression (a × b) + (c × d).
We might first multiply a and b and store the result (a × b) in memory. We
might then multiple c and d, and add the resulting value (c × d) to (a × b) by
recalling the latter value from memory. Observe that the calculator contained
a key to explicitly store a given value into the memory. Observe further that
once a value was stored in memory, it could be read from memory any num-
ber of times, without affecting the value in memory. In fact, it remained valid
