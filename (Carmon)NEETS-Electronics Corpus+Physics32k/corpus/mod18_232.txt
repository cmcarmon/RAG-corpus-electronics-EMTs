There are two transistors in an astable multivibrator. The two output voltages are equal in amplitude,
but are 180 degrees out of phase. The output of the astable multivibrator consists of positive and negative
rectangular waves. Positive rectangular waves are applied to an RC differentiator and converted into
positive and negative trigger pulses. As in the sine-wave synchronizer, the negative trigger pulses are
removed by means of a negative-lobe limiter, and the positive pulses are applied to the transmitter.
