By 1988, nearly 11 MW of PV was interconnected to the utility system in the United States alone. Most were
in the 1- to 5-kW range. The two major exceptions are the 1-MW Hesperia-Lugo project installed in 1982 and
the 6.5-MW Carrisa Plains project installed in 1984, both in California. In Germany, a 340-kW system began
operation in 1988 as part of a large program. Switzerland had a plan to install 1 MW of PV in 333 roof-mounted
units of 3 kW each. By 1990, the installed capacity of PV in Italy exceeded 3 MW. Many nations have recognized
the vast potential of PV and have established their own PV programs within the past decade. A view of the
300 kW ï¬‚at-plate grid-connected PV system installed and operated by the city of Austin electric utility depart-
ment in Austin, Texas is shown in Figure 60.2.
