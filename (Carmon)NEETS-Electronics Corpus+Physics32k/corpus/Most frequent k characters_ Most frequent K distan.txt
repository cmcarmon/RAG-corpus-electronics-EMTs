The second step of algorithm works on two outputs from two different input strings and outputs the similarity coefficient (or distance metric).

Above function, simply gets two input strings, previously outputted from the MostFreqKHashing function. From the most frequent k hashing function, the characters and their frequencies are returned. So, the similarity function calculates the similarity based on characters and their frequencies by checking if the same character appears on both strings. The limit is usually taken to be 10 and in the end the function returns the result of the subtraction of the sum of similarities from limit.
In some implementations, the distance metric is required instead of similarity coefficient. In order to convert the output of above similarity coefficient to distance metric, the output can be subtracted from any constant value (like the maximum possible output value). For the case, it is also possible to implement a wrapper function over above two functions.
