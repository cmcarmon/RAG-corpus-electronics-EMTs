From US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 miles (237 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, airports, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.
Metropolitan areas are clear at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).
