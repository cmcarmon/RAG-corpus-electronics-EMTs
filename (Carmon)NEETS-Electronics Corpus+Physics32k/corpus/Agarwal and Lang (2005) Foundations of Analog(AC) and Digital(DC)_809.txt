These circuits provide us with the insight into implementing logic func-
tions using switches: Series connected switches implement the AND function
and parallel connected switches implement the OR function. Switches can be
combined in AND-OR configurations to implement more complicated func-
tions. As shown previously, the switches implement a form of digital logic
called steering logic. In this form, switches steer values (for example, a high
voltage) along various paths. As we continue our discussion, we shall also see
how switches can be used to build our familiar combinational logic gates.
