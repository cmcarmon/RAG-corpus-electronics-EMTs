The detector can be packaged two ways: ﬁrst with a ﬁber pigtail directly attached to the detector package;
or a more common package is to have a ﬁber connector molded in as part of the package so that a connectorized
ﬁber  can  be  plugged  in  to  it.  Many  LEDs  for  ﬁber  optics  are  now  packaged  with  electronic  drive  circuits  to
form a transmitter module ready to receive standard format data signals.
