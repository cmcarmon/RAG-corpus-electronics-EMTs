that	in	circuit	engineering,	it	is	more	about	actual	field	work.	Once	the	concepts
are	understood,	it’s	best	to	move	on	to	creating	functional	circuit	boards.
A	common	problem	that	is	encountered	by	beginners?	Sweaty	hands.	Even	in	an
air-conditioned	laboratory,	there	are	people	who	have	to	deal	with	sweaty	hands
when	handling	circuits.	Alongside,	they	have	to	deal	with	the	need	of	maintaining
a	strong	and	solid	grip	on	various	tools.	Although	this	may	be	a	concern,	it’s	one
that	requires	practice.
