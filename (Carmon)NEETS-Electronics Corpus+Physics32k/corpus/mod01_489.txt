The EFFICIENCY of an electrical device is the ratio of power converted to useful energy divided by
the power consumed by the device. This number will always be less than one (1.00) because of the losses
in any electrical device. If a device has an efficiency rating of .95, it effectively transforms 95 watts into
useful energy for every 100 watts of input power. The other 5 watts are lost to heat, or other losses which
cannot be used.
