The forces acting on the fluid at free surface should be in equilibrium, i.e. the momentum is conserved at the free surface. The normal forces on either side of the free surface are equal and opposite in direction and the forces in tangential direction should be equal in magnitude and direction.

Here σ is the surface tension, n, t and s are unit vectors in a local orthogonal coordinate system (n,t,s) at the free surface (n is outward normal to the free surface while the other two lie in the tangential plane and are mutually orthogonal). The indices 'l' and 'g' denote liquid and gas, respectively and K is the curvature of the free surface.

The surface tension σ is force per unit length of a surface element and acts tangential to the free surface.

For an infinitesimally small surface element dS, the tangential components of the surface tension forces cancel out when σ = constant, and the normal component can be expressed as a local force that results in a pressure jump across the surface.
