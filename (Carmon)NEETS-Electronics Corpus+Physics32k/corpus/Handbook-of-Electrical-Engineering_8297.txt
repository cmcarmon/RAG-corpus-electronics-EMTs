concerned with providing access points for testing (see controllability and observability in Section 85.2). As test
pattern generation becomes even more prohibitive, probabilistic solutions based on compaction and using fault
simulation are more widespread, especially if they are supported by DFT techniques and they can avoid the
major expense of dedicated external testers. However, any technique chosen must be incorporated within the
framework of a powerful CAD system providing semiautomatic analysis and feedback, such that the rule of ten
can be kept under control: if one does not Ô¨Ånd a failure at a particular stage, then detection at the next stage
will cost 10 times as much!
