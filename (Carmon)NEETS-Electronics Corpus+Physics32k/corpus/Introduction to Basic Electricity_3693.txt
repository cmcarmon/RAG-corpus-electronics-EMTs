a sample of the output voltage to the error- detection cir-
cuit. The voltage changes if the output voltage changes.
The error-detection circuit compares the sampled 
voltage with a reference voltage. In order to produce 
the reference voltage, a zener diode is used. The differ-
ence between the sample and reference voltages is the 
error voltage. An error amplifier amplifies the error 
voltage. The error amplifier controls the conduction of 
the series transistor. The transistor conducts more or 
less to compensate for changes in the output voltage.
