Spoking happens when magnetic tape is wound onto the tape reel with the tension increasing toward
the end of the winding. The higher tension on the outside of the tape pack causes the inner pack to buckle
and deform. Spoking is also caused by the uneven pressures created when a tape is wound on a reel that
has a distorted hub, or when the tape is wound over a small particle that is deposited on the hub. Figure
2-4 shows a spoked tape pack.
