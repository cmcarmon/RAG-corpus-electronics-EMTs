Especially when artificially produced, synchrotron radiation is notable for its:
High brilliance, many orders of magnitude more than with X-rays produced in conventional X-ray tubes: 3rd generation sources typically have a brilliance larger than 1018 photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW, where 0.1%BW denotes a bandwidth 10âˆ’3w centered around the frequency w.
High level of polarization (linear, elliptical or circular)
High collimation, i.e. small angular divergence of the beam
Low emittance, i.e. the product of source cross section and solid angle of emission is small
Wide tunability in energy/wavelength by monochromatization (sub-electronvolt up to the megaelectronvolt range)
Pulsed light emission (pulse durations at or below one nanosecond, or a billionth of a second).
