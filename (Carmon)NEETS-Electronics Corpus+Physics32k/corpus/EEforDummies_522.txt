A transformer is an electronic device that consists of two coils wound around 
the same core material in such a way that the mutual inductance is maxi-
mized. Current passing through one coil, known as the primary, induces a 
voltage in the other coil, known as the secondary. The job of a transformer is 
to transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another.
