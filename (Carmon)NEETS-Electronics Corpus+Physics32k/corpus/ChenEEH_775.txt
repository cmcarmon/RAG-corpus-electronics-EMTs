Intrasignal In-Place Mapping
In a ﬁrst phase, we optimize the internal organization of each
array separately, resulting in a partially ﬁxed storage order for
each array. The intrasignal in-place mapping phase comprises
calculation of the address reference window for-every array as
shown in Figure 2.27 (A) and identiﬁcation of an (optimal)
intra-array storage order as shown in Figure 2.27 (D) (Greef et
al., 1997; Catthoor et al., 1998). The address reference window
represents the maximum distance between two addresses being
occupied by the array at the same time.8 This is calculated
using the geometrical domains for each array referred to as
occupied address/time domains (OATD’s) as shown in Figure
2.27 (A) (Greef et al., 1997).
