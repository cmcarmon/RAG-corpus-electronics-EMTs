Next, the voltage between the two points where the load resistor used to be attached is
determined. Use whatever analysis methods are at your disposal to do this. In this case, the
original circuit with the load resistor removed is nothing more than a simple series circuit
with opposing batteries, and so we can determine the voltage across the open load terminals
by applying the rules of series circuits, Ohm’s Law, and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law:
