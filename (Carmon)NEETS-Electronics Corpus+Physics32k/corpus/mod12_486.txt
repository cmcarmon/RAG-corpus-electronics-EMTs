Pulse modulation is used in radar circuits as well as communications circuits, as discussed in chapter
2. A pulse-modulated signal in radar may be detected by a simple circuit that detects the presence of rf
energy. Circuits that are capable of this were covered in this chapter in the cw detection discussion;
therefore, the information will not be repeated here. A RADAR DETECTOR, in its simplest form, must
be capable of producing an output when rf energy (reflected from a target) is present at its input.
