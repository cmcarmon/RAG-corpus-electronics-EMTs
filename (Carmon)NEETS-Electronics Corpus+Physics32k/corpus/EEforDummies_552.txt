You usually don’t purposely reverse‐bias a diode (except if you’re using a 
Zener diode, which I describe in the section, “Regulating voltage with Zener 
diodes,” later in this chapter). You may accidentally reverse‐bias a diode by 
orienting it incorrectly in a circuit (see the section “Which end is up?” later in
