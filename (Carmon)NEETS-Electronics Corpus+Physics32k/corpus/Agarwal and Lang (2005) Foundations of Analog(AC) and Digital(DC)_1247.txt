A real capacitor can exhibit richer behavior than that described here. For
example, leakage current can flow through its dielectric. The practical signifi-
cance of dielectric leakage is that eventually the charge stored on a capacitor
can leak off. Thus, eventually a real capacitor will lose its memory. Fortu-
nately, capacitors can be made with very low leakage (in other words, with very
high resistance) in which case they are excellent long-term memory devices.
However, if the dielectric leakage is large enough to be significant, then it can
be modeled with a resistor in parallel with the capacitor.
