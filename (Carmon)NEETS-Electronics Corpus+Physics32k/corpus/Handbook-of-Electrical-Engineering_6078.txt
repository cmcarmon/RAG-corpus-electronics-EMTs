His improvements in methods of making cal-
culations  of  current  in  alternating  current  cir-
cuits revolutionized power engineering, and his
theory of electrical transients stood as another
important contribution. In the midst of his GE
career, Steinmetz was also a professor at Union
College and a vocal champion of civic and polit-
ical causes. (Courtesy of the IEEE Center for the
