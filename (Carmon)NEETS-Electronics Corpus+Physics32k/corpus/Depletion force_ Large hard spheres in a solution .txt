The final case described by Asakura and Oosawa describes two large, hard spheres of diameter



D


{\displaystyle D}
, in a solution of small, hard spheres of diameter



d


{\displaystyle d}
. If the distance between the center of the spheres,



h


{\displaystyle h}
, is less than



(
D
+
d
)


{\displaystyle (D+d)}
, then the small spheres are excluded from the space between the large spheres. This results in the area between the spheres having a reduced concentration of small spheres and therefore reduced entropy. This reduced entropy causes a force to act upon the large spheres pushing them together. This effect was convincingly demonstrated in experiments with vibrofluidized granular materials where attraction can be directly visualized.
