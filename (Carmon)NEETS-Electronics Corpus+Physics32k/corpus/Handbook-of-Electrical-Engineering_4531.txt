Sampling Functions
At the core of numerical analysis is the idea of polynomial approximation, an observation made by Arden and
Astill [1970] in facetiously using the subtitle “Numerical Analysis or 1001 Applications of Taylor’s Series.” The
basic idea is to approximate quantities of interest in terms of sampling functions, often polynomials, that are
then substituted for these quantities in various analytical operations. Thus, integral operators are replaced by
ﬁnite sums, and differential operators are similarly replaced by generalized ﬁnite differences. For example, use
of a ﬁrst-order difference to approximate a derivative of the function F(x) in terms of samples F(x+) and F(x–)
