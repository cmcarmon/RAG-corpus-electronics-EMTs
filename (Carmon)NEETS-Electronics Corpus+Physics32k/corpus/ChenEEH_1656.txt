As discussed in the previous sections, multimedia data poses
its distinct challenges for modeling and representation. The
huge amount of multimedia information now available makes
it all the more important to organize these multimedia reposi-
tories in a structured and coherent way to make it more
accessible to a large number of users. This section explores
the problem of storing multimedia information in a structured
form (indexing) and searching the multimedia repositories in
an efﬁcient manner (retrieval). Subsection 6.3.1 outlines an
image indexing and retrieval paradigm. The subsection ﬁrst
discusses the motivation for using content-based indexing and
retrieval for images and then explores several different issues
and research directions in this ﬁeld. Subsection 6.3.2 highlights
similar problems in the area of video indexing and retrieval. As
with any other emerging ﬁeld going through intellectual and
technical exploration, the domain of content-based access to
multimedia repositories causes a number of research issues to
surface; these issues cannot be summarized in a single concise
presentation. One such issue is query language design for
multimedia databases. The interested reader can refer to

Kaushik and Rundensteiner (1998), and Zhang et al. (1997).
