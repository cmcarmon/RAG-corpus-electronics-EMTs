The solder mask controls or indicates where the 
solder will be placed on the printed circuit board 
pads during a process called wave soldering. This sol-
der only connects the components to the solder pads. 
When making only one or two boards with a simple 
design, a solder mask may not be needed. Addition-
ally, the solder mask adds corrosion protection to the 
printed circuit board traces.
