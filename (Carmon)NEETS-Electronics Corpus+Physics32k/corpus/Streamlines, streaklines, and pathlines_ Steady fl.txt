In steady flow (when the velocity vector-field does not change with time), the streamlines, pathlines, and streaklines coincide. This is because when a particle on a streamline reaches a point,




a

0




{\displaystyle a_{0}}
, further on that streamline the equations governing the flow will send it in a certain direction






x
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}
. As the equations that govern the flow remain the same when another particle reaches




a

0




{\displaystyle a_{0}}
it will also go in the direction






x
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}
. If the flow is not steady then when the next particle reaches position




a

0




{\displaystyle a_{0}}
the flow would have changed and the particle will go in a different direction.
This is useful, because it is usually very difficult to look at streamlines in an experiment. However, if the flow is steady, one can use streaklines to describe the streamline pattern.
