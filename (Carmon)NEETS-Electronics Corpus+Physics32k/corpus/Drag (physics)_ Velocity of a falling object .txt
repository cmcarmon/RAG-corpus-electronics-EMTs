The velocity as a function of time for an object falling through a non-dense medium, and released at zero relative-velocity v = 0 at time t = 0, is roughly given by a function involving a hyperbolic tangent (tanh):




v

)

.



{\displaystyle v(t)={\sqrt {\frac {2mg}{\rho AC_{d}}}}\tanh \left(t{\sqrt {\frac {g\rho C_{d}A}{2m}}}\right).\,}


The hyperbolic tangent has a limit value of one, for large time t. In other words, velocity asymptotically approaches a maximum value called the terminal velocity vt:

{\displaystyle v_{t}={\sqrt {\frac {2mg}{\rho AC_{d}}}}.\,}


For a potato-shaped object of average diameter d and of density ρobj, terminal velocity is about

{\displaystyle v_{t}={\sqrt {gd{\frac {\rho _{obj}}{\rho }}}}.\,}


For objects of water-like density (raindrops, hail, live objects—mammals, birds, insects, etc.) falling in air near Earth's surface at sea level, the terminal velocity is roughly equal to

{\displaystyle v_{t}=90{\sqrt {d}},\,}


with d in metre and vt in m/s. For example, for a human body (






d


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} d}
~ 0.6 m)







v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v_{t}}
~ 70 m/s, for a small animal like a cat (






d


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} d}
~ 0.2 m)







v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v_{t}}
~ 40 m/s, for a small bird (






d


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} d}
~ 0.05 m)







v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v_{t}}
~ 20 m/s, for an insect (






d


{\displaystyle \mathbf {} d}
~ 0.01 m)







v

{\displaystyle \mathbf {} v_{t}}
~ 9 m/s, and so on. Terminal velocity for very small objects (pollen, etc.) at low Reynolds numbers is determined by Stokes law.
Terminal velocity is higher for larger creatures, and thus potentially more deadly. A creature such as a mouse falling at its terminal velocity is much more likely to survive impact with the ground than a human falling at its terminal velocity. A small animal such as a cricket impacting at its terminal velocity will probably be unharmed. This, combined with the relative ratio of limb cross-sectional area vs. body mass (commonly referred to as the Square-cube law), explains why very small animals can fall from a large height and not be harmed.
