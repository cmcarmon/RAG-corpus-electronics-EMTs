Unix time (also known as POSIX time or UNIX Epoch time) is a system for describing a point in time, defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, minus the number of leap seconds that have taken place since then. It is used widely in Unix-like and many other operating systems and file formats. Because the same timestamp can refer to two distinct instants of time around a leap second, it is neither a linear measure of time nor a true representation of UTC. Unix time may be checked on most Unix systems by typing date +%s on the command line.
On systems where the representation of Unix time is as a signed 32-bit number, the representation will end after the completion of 2,147,483,647 (231 - 1) seconds from 00:00:00 on 1 January 1970 minus the number of leap seconds that have taken place since then, which will happen on 19 January, 2038 03:14:08 UTC. This is referred to as the "Year 2038 problem" where the 32-bit signed Unix time will overflow and will take the actual count to negative.
