There are 19 natural satellites in the Solar System that are known to be massive enough to be close to hydrostatic equilibrium, which Alan Stern calls satellite planets. However, several of these were once in equilibrium but are no longer: these include all of the moons listed for Saturn apart from Titan and Rhea. Other moons that were once in equilibrium but are no longer very round, such as Saturn's Phoebe, are not included. Satellites are listed first in order from the Sun, and second in order from their parent body.
