resistor or LED).
Attach the black lead to one side of the component and attach the red 
lead to the other side of the component. This action places your multi-
meter in parallel with the voltage drop you want to measure.
If you attach the black lead to the more negative side of the component 
(that is, the side that is closer to the negative side of the battery pack) 
and the red lead to the more positive side of the component, your multi-
meter will register positive volts. If you attach your multimeter leads the 
other way, your multimeter will register negative volts.
