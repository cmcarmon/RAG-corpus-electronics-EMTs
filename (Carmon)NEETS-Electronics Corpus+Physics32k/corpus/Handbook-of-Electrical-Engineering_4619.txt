Magnetostriction
Some ferromagnetic materials become strained when subjected to a magnetic ﬁeld. The effect is quadratic in
the ﬁeld, so a bias ﬁeld or dc current is required for linear operation. Important magnetostrictive metals and
alloys include nickel and permendur. At one time, magnetostrictive transducers were used extensively in active
sonars  but  have  now  been  largely  replaced  by  ceramic  transducers.  Magnetostrictive  transducers  are  rugged
and  reliable  but  inefﬁcient  and  conﬁgurationally  awkward.  Recently,  it  has  been  discovered  that  certain  rare
earth  iron  alloys  such  as  terbium-dysprosium-iron  possess  extremely  large  magnetostrictions  (as  much  as
100 times that of nickel). They have relatively low eddy current losses but require large bias ﬁelds, are fragile,
and have yet to ﬁnd signiﬁcant applications. Metallic glasses have also recently been considered for magneto-
strictive transducers.
