Another use of the term steering ratio is for the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire behavior and the actual turning radius based on real tire behavior. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip is greater than the rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering.
