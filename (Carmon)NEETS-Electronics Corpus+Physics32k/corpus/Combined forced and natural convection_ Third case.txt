The third case is referred to as transverse flow. This occurs when the buoyant motion acts perpendicular to the forced motion. This enhances fluid mixing, and enhances the heat transfer. An example of this is air flowing horizontally over a hot or cold pipe. This can encourage phase changes, which often creates a very high heat transfer coefficient. For example, steam leaving a boiler can pass through a pipe that has a fan blowing over it, cooling the steam back to a saturated liquid.
