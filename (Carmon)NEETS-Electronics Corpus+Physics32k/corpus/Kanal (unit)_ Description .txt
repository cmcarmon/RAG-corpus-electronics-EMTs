A kanal is a traditional unit of land area. In India it is used in the northern states of Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir and North Eastern parts of Pakistan. Its use in India is in decline with urban land measurements standardizing on use of square feet, square meters and square yards.
Under British rule the marla and kanal were standardized so that the kanal equals exactly 605 square yards or ​1⁄8 acre; this is equivalent to about 505.857 square meters. A kanal is equal to 20 marlas.
