The UNIJUNCTION TRANSISTOR (UJT), originally called a double-based diode, is a three-
terminal, solid-state device that has several advantages over conventional transistors. It is very stable over 
a wide range of temperatures and allows a reduction of components when used in place of conventional 
transistors. A comparison is shown in figure 3-38. View A is a circuit using conventional transistors, and 
view B is the same circuit using the UJT. As you can see, the UJT circuit has fewer components. 
Reducing the number of components reduces the cost, size, and probability of failure.
