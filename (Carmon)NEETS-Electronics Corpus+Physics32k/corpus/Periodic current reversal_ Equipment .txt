The earliest (and simplest) PCR arrangements simply use an offset AC (sine wave) voltage where the potential will reverse for a time each cycle (e.g. a half wave rectifier with leaky diode). Modern PCR equipment uses electronic switching to do the reversal allowing a square wave form with precise control of the timing and currents for forward and reverse currents. Often PCR cycles will incorporate zero current phases as well (this could be seen as a variation on pulse charging adding the short reversals during rest periods).
