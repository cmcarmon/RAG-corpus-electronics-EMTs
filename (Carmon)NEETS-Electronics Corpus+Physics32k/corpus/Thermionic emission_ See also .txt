Space charge, work function — key physics concepts that influence thermionic emission.
Hot cathode — article describing construction and behaviour of practical thermionic cathodes.
Thermionic converter — a type of heat engine that directly produces electrical power via thermionic emission.
Vacuum tube, X-ray tube, fluorescent lamp, cathode ray tube — vacuum electronic devices that typically use a thermionic cathode as an electron source.
Thermoelectric effect — not to be confused with thermionic emission, thermoelectricity is the thermal generation of electric currents within solid conductors.
