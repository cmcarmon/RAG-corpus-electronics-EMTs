Other Components
There  are  a  number  of  other  ﬁber  components,  not  shown  in  Fig. 71.6,  that  can  be  found  in  some  systems.
These include passive couplers for tapping off some portion of the beam from the single ﬁber and wavelength-
division multiplexers for coupling different optical carriers onto the transmission ﬁber.
