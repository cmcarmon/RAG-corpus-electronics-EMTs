Si bipolar transistors is limited to frequencies less than about 40 GHz, the heterojunction bipolar transistors
(HBTs) can operate in excess of 100 GHz. They are useful in both low-noise and high RF power applications.
The heterostructure concept has recently been applied in Si-based devices using heterostructures using SiGe/Si
compounds.  These  devices  show  consider  promise  for  high-frequency  applications  and  the  transistors  have
demonstrated RF performance comparable to that obtained from the AlGaAs/GaAs HBTs.
