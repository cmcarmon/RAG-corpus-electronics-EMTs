frequency-dependent polynomial or other mathematical func-
tions. In general, the design of a ﬁlter requires three steps,
starting with the network synthesis of a low-pass LC prototype
(using normalized frequency, normalized bandwidth, and spe-
ciﬁed slope selectivity) as shown in Figure 7.34. The insertion–
loss method and the image–parameter method are most fre-
quently used to calculate network parameters of the prototype
transfer function. Then, the prototype network and parameters
are transformed or frequency-scaled to the actual frequency
speciﬁcations. Finally, the synthesized network is physically
designed and produced by either lumped LC elements, com-
mensurate line planar microstrip, waveguide sections, or other
building blocks. Special techniques to transform LC param-
