Mel Cepstrum
In the 1980s, the cepstrum began to supplant the direct use of
the LP parameters as the premier features in speech recogni-
tion because of two convenient enhancements that improve
performance (Davis and Mermelstein, 1980). The Ô¨Årst is the
ability to easily smooth the spectrum using the liftering process
described above. This process removes the inherent variability
of the LP-based spectrum due to the excitation. A second
improvement over direct use of the LP parameters can be
obtained by use of the so-called mel-cepstrum.
