Figure 3-56(A) is a schematic of a circuit that is not drawn in the box-like fashion used in previous
illustrations. To redraw this circuit, start at the voltage source and trace the path for current to the junction
marked (a). At this junction the current divides into three paths. If you were to stretch the wire to show
the three current paths, the circuit would appear as shown in figure 3-56(B).
