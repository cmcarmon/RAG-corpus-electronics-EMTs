Several  handbooks,  e.g.,  Electrical  Engineer’s  Reference  Book  and  Standard  Handbook  for  Electrical  Engineers,
give  more  details  on  the  machine  design.  [Bumby,  1983]  covers  the  subject  of  superconducting  generators.
Some textbooks in the area of rotating machines are listed as [Sarma, 1979; Chapman, 1991; McPherson, 1981].
The  quarterly  journal  IEEE  Transactions  on  Energy  Conversion  covers  the  ﬁeld  of  rotating  machinery  and
power generation. Another IEEE quarterly journal, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, is devoted to the general
aspects of power system engineering and power engineering education.
