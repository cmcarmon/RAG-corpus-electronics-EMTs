IS-95  has  also  incorporated  channel  aggregation  in  recent  revisions. As  mentioned  before,  IS-95  supports
two voice codec rates of 8 Kbps and 13 Kbps. As proposed in the recent IS-95-B wireless standard, a single user
can send or receive multiple trafÔ¨Åc channels, each of which either support 8 Kbps or 13 Kbps (but not both
rates mixed). The maximum number of such channels is eight in either the uplink or downlink, and only one
channel is variable rate.
