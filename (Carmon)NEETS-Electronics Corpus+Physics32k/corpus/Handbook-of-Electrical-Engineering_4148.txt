Of the many different processes that occur during the various phases of a negative cloud-to-ground lightning
(e.g., the in-cloud K processes, in-cloud J processes, and cloud to ground M components that occur between
strokes and after the ﬁnal stroke and are not discussed here), the electric and magnetic ﬁelds associated with
the return stroke described above generally are the largest and hence the most signiﬁcant in inducing unwanted
voltages in electronic and electric power systems. This is the case because the currents in all other lightning
processes are generally smaller than return stroke currents and the ground strike point of the return stroke can
be much closer to objects on the ground than are in-cloud discharges. Cloud discharges exhibit currents similar
to those of the in-cloud processes occurring in ground discharges and hence produce similar relatively small
ﬁelds at or near ground level.
