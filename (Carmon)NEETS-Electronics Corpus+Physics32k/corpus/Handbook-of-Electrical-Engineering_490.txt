There  is  an  extremely  important  difference  between  the  singly  terminated  (dc  gain  =  1)  and  the  doubly
terminated Ô¨Ålters (dc gain = 0.5). As was shown by John Orchard, the sensitivity in the passband (ideally at
equal terminations is zero. This is true regardless
maximum output) to all 
of the circuit.
