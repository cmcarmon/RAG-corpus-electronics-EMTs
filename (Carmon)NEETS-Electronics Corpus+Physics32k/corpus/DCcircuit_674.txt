With such a meter design, each resistor value is determined by the same technique, using
a known total voltage, movement full-scale deï¬‚ection rating, and movement resistance. For a
voltmeter with ranges of 1 volt, 10 volts, 100 volts, and 1000 volts, the multiplier resistances
would be as follows:
