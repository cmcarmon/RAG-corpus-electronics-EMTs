Returning to Figure 11.14, the microstrip feed is inset into
the antenna a distance x to obtain an input match. The
dimension b is chosen so that the cavity formed by the con-
ductor on the top plane of the structure is resonant. This
causes radiation at the two edges of the antenna, as shown by
the fringing ﬁelds in the diagram. A simple and intuitive
technique for modeling this antenna is the transmission line
model. This model provides a reasonable estimate for the
resonant frequency and a fairly accurate estimate of the input
impedance close to resonance. Due to the narrow bandwidth
of the patch antenna, it is typically not accurate enough to
guarantee ﬁrst-pass design success. The bandwidth, however,
does provide a useful starting point as well as useful insight
into the operation of the antenna.
