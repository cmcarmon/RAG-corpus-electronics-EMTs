The three coordinate axes are referred to as the principal axes of the crystal. For cubic crystals, 
 and
they are isotropic. In tetragonal, hexagonal, and rhombohedral crystals, two of the three parameters are equal.
  Here  there  is  a  two-dimensional  degeneracy;  the  principal  axis  that  exhibits  this

anisotropy is called the optic axis. For a uniaxial crystal with
