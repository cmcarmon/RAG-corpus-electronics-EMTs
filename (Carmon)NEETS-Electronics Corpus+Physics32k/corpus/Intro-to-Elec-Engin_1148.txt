or Is = 2.74 per unit, with Iﬂ taken as 1 per unit.
The applied voltage to the motor must reduce the current from 6 per unit to 2.74 per unit,
i.e., the tapping must be sufﬁcient to reduce the voltage to 2.74/6 = 0.456 of the full value.
The supply-source line current will then be 2.74 × 0.456 = 1.25 per unit, where 0.456 is the
secondary-to-primary turns ratio.
