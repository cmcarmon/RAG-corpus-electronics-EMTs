POLE CONSTRUCTION.â€”Note that the pole pieces in figures 3-2 and 3-3 have curved faces.
You can see the advantage of this type of construction if you remember that lines of force enter and leave
a magnetic field in the air gap at right angles to the coil, regardless of the angular position of the coil.
Because of this type of construction, a more linear scale is possible than if the pole faces were flat.
