Assume only moderate gain (say 100) for the Op Amp so you cannot assume v
.
How large does C2 have to be compared to C1 in order for the two circuits to behave
the same? The increase in the effective size of C1 because of the gain of the amplifier is
called the Miller Effect, and is used in Op Amp design.

rout zero, but including amplifier saturation effects).
