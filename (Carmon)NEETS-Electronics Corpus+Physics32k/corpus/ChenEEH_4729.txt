The ﬁeld of nonlinear adaptive control developed rapidly in
the 1990s. Work by Polycarpou and Ioannu (1991) and others
gave birth to an important branch of adaptive control theory:
the nonlinear online function approximation-based control,
which includes neural (Polycarpou, 1996) and fuzzy (Su and
Stepanenko, 1994) approaches (note that several other relevant
works are focused on neural and fuzzy control, many of them
cited in the references within the above publications). The
neural and fuzzy approaches are most of the time equivalent,
differing between each other only for the structure of the
approximator chosen (Spooner and Passino, 1996). Most of
these publications deal with indirect adaptive control, trying
ﬁrst to identify the dynamics of the systems and eventually
generating a control input according to the certainty equiva-
lence principle (with some modiﬁcation to add robustness to
the control
law), whereas very few authors (Spooner and
Passino, 1996; Rovithakis and Christodoulou, 1995) use the
direct approach in which the controller directly generates the
control input to guarantee stability.
