Here, open-loop MCV and full-state feedback MCV control
laws are discussed. An open-loop control law is a function
u: [0, tF ] ! u where u is some speciÔ¨Åed allowable set of con-
trol values. A closed-loop or feedback control law is a func-
tion that depends on time and the past evolution of the process
[i.e., u(t, x(s); 0  s  t) ].
