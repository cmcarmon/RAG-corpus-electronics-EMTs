â€¢ Servomechanisms. Their inputs are time-varying and their function consists in providing
a one-to-one correspondence between input and output. Position-control systems, includ-
ing automobile power steering, form good examples. Servomechanisms are usually type
1 or higher order systems. A type 1 system has no steady-state error with a constant
position input, but has a position error with a constant velocity input (the two shafts
running at the same velocity, but with an angular displacement between them).
