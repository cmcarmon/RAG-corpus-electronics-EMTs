One type of constrained information pattern that is of interest in a number of applications is a network consisting
of a number of distributed or local decision makers, each of which processes a subset of the measurements, and
a  fusion  center,  which  combines  the  outputs  of  the  distributed  decision  makers  to  produce  a  global  detection
decision. The communication between the distributed decision makers and the fusion center is constrained, so
that  each  local  decision  maker  must  reduce  its  subset  of  measurements  to  a  summarizing  local  decision  to  be
transmitted to the fusion center. Such structures arise in applications such as the testing of large-scale integrated
circuits, in which data collection is decentralized, or in detection problems involving very large data sets, in which
it is desirable to distribute the computational work of the detection algorithm. Such problems lie in the ﬁeld of
distributed  detection.  Except  in  some  trivial  special  cases,  the  constraints  imposed  by  distributing  the  detection
algorithm  introduce  a  further  level  of  difﬁculty  into  the  design  of  optimum  detection  systems.  Nevertheless,
considerable progress has been made on this problem, a survey of which can be found in Tsitsiklis [1993].
