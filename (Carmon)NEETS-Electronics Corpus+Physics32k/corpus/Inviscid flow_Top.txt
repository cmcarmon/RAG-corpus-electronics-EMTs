Inviscid flow is the flow of an inviscid fluid, in which the viscosity of the fluid is equal to zero. Though there are limited examples of inviscid fluids, known as superfluids, inviscid flow has many applications in fluid dynamics. The Reynolds number of inviscid flow approaches infinity, as the viscosity approaches zero. When viscous forces are neglected, such as the case of inviscid flow, the Navier-Stokes equation can be simplified to a form known as the Euler equation. This simplified equation is applicable to inviscid flow as well as flow with low viscosity and a Reynolds number much greater than one. Using the Euler equation, many fluid dynamics problems involving low viscosity are easily solved, however, the assumed negligible viscosity is no longer valid in the region of fluid near a solid boundary.
The fluid itself need not have zero viscosity for inviscid flow to occur. It is also possible to arrange the flow of a viscous fluid so that viscous forces vanish. Such a flow has no viscous resistance to its motion. These "inviscid flow arrangements" are vortex-like and may play a key role in the formation of the tornado, the tropical cyclone, and turbulence.
