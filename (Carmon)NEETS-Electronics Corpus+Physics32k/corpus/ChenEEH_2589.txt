eters into corresponding line dimensions or waveguide geom-
etries have been developed. Most of them are based on the
well-established impedance and admittance inverters tech-
nique (so-called K- and J-inverters) (Mattaei et al. 1980). In
practice, postfabrication tuning elements or other similar cor-
rective measures are required to account for interelement
coupling, inaccurate material parameters, mechanical toler-
ances, and parasitic effects.
