The simplifying step is the same regardless if the system was electromagnetic or linear mechanical. The steps are:
Remove Bond of zero power (due to ground or zero velocity)
Remove 0 and 1 junctions with less than three bonds
Simplify parallel power
Combine 0 junctions in series
Combine 1 junctions in series
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.
