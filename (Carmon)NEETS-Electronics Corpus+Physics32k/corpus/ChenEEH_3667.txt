The nasals are voiced consonants produced with the glottal
waveform exciting an open nasal cavity. Their waveforms
resemble vowels but are normally weaker in energy due to
limited ability of the nasal cavity to radiate sound. In forming
a nasal, a complete closure is made toward the front of the
vocal tract, either at the lips (=m= as in more), with the tongue
resting on the gum ridge (=n= as in noon), or by the tongue
pressing at the soft or hard palate (=G= as in sing).
