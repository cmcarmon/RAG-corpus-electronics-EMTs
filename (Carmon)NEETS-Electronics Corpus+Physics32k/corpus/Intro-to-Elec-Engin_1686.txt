The block diagram of Figure 16.3.10 illustrates a typical microprocessor system used to
implement the digital PI controller. It would be simple to include the derivative operation to
implement the PID controller. While an analog timer is shown in Figure 16.3.10 to determine
the start of the next sampling period, a software timing loop can be used to keep track of when
T seconds have elapsed. The output pulse, once every T seconds, is applied to the interrupt
line of the microprocessor. This will cause the processor to execute the interrupt routine to
output the next value of the control, u[(k + 1)T ], which is sent to the D/A converter, whose
output in turn controls the power ampliﬁer. The timing pulse from the timer is also sent to the
“sample” command line, thereby triggering the sample-and-hold circuitry; the motor velocity
ω(t) is sampled and held constant for one sampling period. The value of ω(kT) is then converted
to an N-bit binary number by the A/D circuitry. The microprocessor is signaled via “data ready”
line (which may be attached to the interrupt line of the microprocessor) that the sampled data
have been converted. The second interrupt will cause the processor to read in the value of
