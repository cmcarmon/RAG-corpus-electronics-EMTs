For  example,  a  typical  high-resolution  20-inch  diagonal  color  monitor  requires  70  W  from  the  main  ac
50/60-Hz power supply and generates a picture visible in any ofﬁce environment with a luminous efﬁciency of
6 to 8 lm/W. These two factors, high luminous efﬁciency and convenience of addressing, make the CRT difﬁcult
to replace by any other type of display for large image contents.
