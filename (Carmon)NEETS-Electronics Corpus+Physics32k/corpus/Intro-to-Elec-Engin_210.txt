Y(s). Note that both the impedance and the admittance are in general functions of the variable
s, and they are reciprocal of each other. Such expressions as Equations (3.1.11) through (3.1.16)
relate the amplitudes of the exponential voltages and currents, and are the frequency-domain
representations of the elements. Networks drawn using impedance or admittance symbols are
known as transformed networks, which play a signiﬁcant role in ﬁnding the network response, as
shown in the following examples.
