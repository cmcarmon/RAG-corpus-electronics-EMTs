A relaying concept widely used for protection of busses,
generators, power transformers, and transmission lines is the
current differential. It assumes that the currents entering and
leaving the power system component are measured and com-
pared to each other. If the input and output currents are the
same, then it means that the protected component is ‘‘healthy,’’
and no relaying action is taken. If the current comparison
indicates that there is a deference, which means that a differ-
ence is caused by a fault, the relay action is called upon. The
difference has to be signiﬁcant enough to be attributed to a
fault since some normal operating conditions and inaccuracies
in the instrument transformers may also indicate a difference
that is not attributed to a fault. More discussion about the
