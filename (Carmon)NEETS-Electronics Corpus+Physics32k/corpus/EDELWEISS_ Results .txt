The results from the first phase of the experiment (EDELWEISS I) were published in 2005, excluding WIMP dark matter with an interaction cross-section above ≈10−6 pb (at ≈85 GeV).
EDELWEISS-II ran 2009–10 with 4 kg of detectors (for a total effective exposure of 384 kg·d) limiting high mass and low mass WIMPs, and axions. A cross-section of 4.4×10−8 pb is excluded at 90% C.L. for WIMP mass of 85 GeV. (Just above projected CDMS results in Fig A.)
