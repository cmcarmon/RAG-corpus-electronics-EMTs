The monostable multivibrator (sometimes called a ONE-SHOT MULTIVIBRATOR) is a square- or 
rectangular-wave generator with just one stable condition. With no input signal (quiescent condition) one 
amplifier conducts and the other is in cutoff. The monostable multivibrator is basically used for pulse 
stretching. It is used in computer logic systems and communication navigation equipment.
