The deﬁnition of an electric ﬁeld as the negative gradient of the
electrostatic potential implies that the direction of the electric
ﬁeld at a given point in space is always perpendicular to the
local equipotential line (or surface) at that point in space.
When the electric ﬁeld vectors are drawn throughout an elec-
trostatic ﬁeld, they take on the character of streamlines in a
classic ﬂuid ﬂow ﬁeld. Those lines are called electric ﬁeld
lines, and the tube-like volumes formed by bundles of such
lines are called Faraday’s tubes of electric ﬂux or lines of force.
The intensity of the electric ﬁeld is represented by the density
of these lines, being greatest where they are closest to each
other. The lines of force and the equipotential surfaces form a
curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system with important
properties. Figure 2.6 illustrates such a system for the case of
two line charges.
