The figure shows that each stage of amplification has a 180ยบ phase shift. This means that the output 
signal of Q2 will be in phase with the input signal to Q1. A portion of the output signal of Q2 is coupled 
back to the input of Q1 through the feedback network of C3 and R3. R3 should have a large resistance to 
limit the amount of signal through the feedback network. C3 should have a large capacitance so the 
capacitive reactance is low and the capacitor will couple the signal easily.
