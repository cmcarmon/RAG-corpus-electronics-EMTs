When u1 > uc, the wave number k(2)
z will be purely imaginary,
of the form k(2)
. In this case, there is no power ﬂow
into the second region because the phase vector in region 2 has
no z component. In this case, 100% of the incident power is
reﬂected back from the interface. There are, however, ﬁelds still
present in region 2, decaying exponentially with distance z. In
region 2, the power ﬂow is in the horizontal direction only.
