Since small-signal S-parameters are almost always operated
in large-signal mode, they are typically not sufﬁcient to en-
sure an accurate design. Other techniques include load-pull
to determine optimal terminations or large-signal models,
which are often available from the manufacturer or built into
popular microwave CAD tools. The most common ﬁgure of
merit for a microwave power transistor is the 1-dB compres-
sion point, a measure of the power-handling capabilities of the
transistor. This is deﬁned as the power where the saturation of
the transistor reduces the power gain of the transistor by 1 dB
from the small-signal power gain. This is graphically illustrated
in Figure 11.9. The dynamic range is the range of linear
performance that the ampliﬁer provides measured from the
minimal detectable output signal at the noise power level to
the 1-dB compression point, P1 dB.
