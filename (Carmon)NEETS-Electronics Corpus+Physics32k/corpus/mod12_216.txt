while maintaining minimum distortion. The power to develop the modulation envelope comes from the rf 
amplifier. Because the rf amplifier has to be capable of supplying this additional power, it is biased for 
(and driven by the carrier frequency at) a much lower output level than its rating. This reduced efficiency 
is necessary during nonmodulated periods to provide the tube with the power to develop the sidebands.
