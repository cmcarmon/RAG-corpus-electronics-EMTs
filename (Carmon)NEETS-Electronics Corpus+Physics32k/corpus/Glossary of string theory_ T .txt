T-duality

A string duality relating theories on a large spacetime to theories on a small spacetime. In particular it exchanges type IIA and IIB superstring theory.
tachyon

A particle of imaginary mass moving faster than light.
ToE
TOE
Theory of everything
type I
type II
type IIA
type IIB

A type of superstring or the corresponding low-energy supergravity theory. The Roman numeral I or II refers to the number of d=10 supersymmetries, and types IIA or IIB are distinguished by whether the supersymmetries of left and right movers have opposite or identical chiralities.
