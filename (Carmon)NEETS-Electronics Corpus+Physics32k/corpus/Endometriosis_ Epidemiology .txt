One estimate is that 10.8 million people are affected globally as of 2015. Other sources estimate about 6â€“10% of women are affected. It may affect more than 11% of American women between 15 and 44. Endometriosis is most common in those in their thirties and forties; however, it can begin in girls as early as 8 years old.
It can affect any female, from premenarche to postmenopause, regardless of race or ethnicity or whether or not they have had children. It is primarily a disease of the reproductive years. Incidences of endometriosis have occurred in postmenopausal women, and in less common cases, girls may have endometriosis symptoms before they even reach menarche.
