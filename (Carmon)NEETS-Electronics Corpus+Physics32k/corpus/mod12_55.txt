The rate at which the vector rotates determines the FREQUENCY of the sine wave that is generated; 
that is, the faster the vector rotates, the more cycles completed in a given time period. The basic time 
period used is 1 second. If a vector completes one revolution per 1 second, the resultant sine wave has a 
frequency 1 cycle per second (1 hertz). If the rate of rotation is increased to 1,000 revolutions per second, 
the frequency of the sine wave generated will be 1,000 cycles per second (1 kilohertz).
