The device shown in the above photograph is a kind of transformer, with two concentric
wire coils. It is actually intended as a precision standard unit for mutual inductance, but for
the purposes of illustrating what the essence of a transformer is, it will sufﬁce. The two wire
coils can be distinguished from each other by color: the bulk of the tube’s length is wrapped in
green-insulated wire (the ﬁrst coil) while the second coil (wire with bronze-colored insulation)
stands in the middle of the tube’s length. The wire ends run down to connection terminals at
the bottom of the unit. Most transformer units are not built with their wire coils exposed like
this.
