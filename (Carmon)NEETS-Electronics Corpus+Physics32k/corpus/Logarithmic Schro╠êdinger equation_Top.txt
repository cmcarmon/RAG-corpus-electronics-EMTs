In theoretical physics, the logarithmic Schrödinger equation (sometimes abbreviated as LNSE or LogSE) is one of the nonlinear modifications of Schrödinger's equation. It is a classical wave equation with applications to extensions of quantum mechanics, quantum optics, nuclear physics, transport and diffusion phenomena, open quantum systems and information theory, effective quantum gravity and physical vacuum models and theory of superfluidity and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its relativistic version (with D'Alembertian instead of Laplacian and first-order time derivative) was first proposed by G. Rosen. It is an example of an integrable model.
