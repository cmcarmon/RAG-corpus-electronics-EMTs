The on-resistance of the MOSFET depends on several factors related to the
physical properties of the MOSFET, such as its geometry. Typical values for
the resistance range from a few milliohms for discrete MOSFET components
to several k for MOSFETs in VLSI technology. Let us take a quick look at
the physical structure of MOSFETs to obtain some insight into the relationship
between their on resistance and their geometry.
