At the usual radio frequencies, propagating electromagnetic energy does not follow the earth’s surface.
Line-of-sight communication has the transmitter and receiver antennas in visual contact with each other.
Assuming both antennas have height h above the earth’s surface, maximum line-of-sight distance is
