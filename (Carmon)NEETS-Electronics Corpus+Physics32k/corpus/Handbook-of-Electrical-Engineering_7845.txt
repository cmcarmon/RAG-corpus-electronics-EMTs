FIGURE 80.32  Schematic diagram describing the polar magneto-optical Kerr effect. Upon reï¬‚ection from the surface of
a perpendicularly magnetized medium, the polarization vector undergoes a rotation. The sense of rotation depends on the
direction of magnetization, M, and switches sign when M is reversed.
