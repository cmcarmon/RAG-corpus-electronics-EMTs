Use of the Tourniquet.Â—A tourniquet is a constricting band that is used to cut off the supply of 
blood to an injured limb. It cannot be used to control bleeding from the head, neck, or trunk, since its use 
in these locations would result in greater injury or death. A tourniquet should be used only if the control 
of hemorrhage by other means proves to be impossible.
