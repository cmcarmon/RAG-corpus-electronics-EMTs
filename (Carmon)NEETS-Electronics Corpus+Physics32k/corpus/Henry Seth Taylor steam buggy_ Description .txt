The Buggy was modeled after a US-built steam car Taylor had seen in 1864. It was designed by Taylor to have a coal-fired boiler for the carriage. Fully pressurized, the steam was used to move a piston attached to the rear axle, producing forward motion. The vehicle does not have a reverse gear or brakes. It was able to travel at a sustained 20 km/h (12 mph). The vehicle features thin strips of metal bent around the edge of the wheels in place of rubber tires. It is powered by a two-cylinder boiler mounted behind the driver. Steam is generated in the vertical coal-fired boiler, which is connected by rubber hoses to a six-gallon water tank located between the front wheels.  The vehicle lacks a coal box, but has a storage nook for lump coal or wood under the driverâ€™s perch.
The vehicle weighs 500 pounds (230 kg). The boiler (as designed) can withstand 60 pounds (27 kg) of pressure. It was the only example built, not having been meant for mass production; rather, it was exhibited as a curiosity at fairs around the area.
