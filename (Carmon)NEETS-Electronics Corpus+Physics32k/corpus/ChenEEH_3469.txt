The most common bus protection principle is the current
differential approach. All connections to the bus are moni-
tored through current transformers to detect current imbal-
ance. If an internal bus fault occurs, the balance between
incoming and outgoing currents is drastically disturbed, and
that becomes a criterion for tripping the bus breakers and
isolating the bus from the rest of the system. This relaying
principle would be very simple to implement if there were no
problems with CT saturation. Due to high-fault currents, one
of the CTs may see extraordinary high currents during a close-
in external fault. This may cause the CT to saturate, making it
very difÔ¨Åcult to distinguish if the CT was saturated due to high
currents from an internal or external fault. If air-gap or air-
core CTs are used, the saturation may not be an issue, and the
current differential relaying is easily applied. This solution is
more costly and is used far less frequently than the solu-
tion using standard iron-core CTs.
