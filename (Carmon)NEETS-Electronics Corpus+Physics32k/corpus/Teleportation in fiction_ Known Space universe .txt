In Larry Niven's Ringworld and in other novels from the Known Space universe, Earth's citizens travel instantaneously from point to point in glass "displacement" booths for a marginal fee. Destination is specified by dialling a destination number, much like we would dial a telephone today. Displacement actually occurs at light speed, but because any distance on earth is negligible at that speed, the trip is perceived as instantaneous.
