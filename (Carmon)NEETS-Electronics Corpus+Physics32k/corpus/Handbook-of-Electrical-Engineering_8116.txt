More  extensive  semiconductor  device  treatments  of  the  LED  are  contained  in  Semiconductor  Devices  and
Integrated Circuits by A. G. Milnes (Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York) and in Introduction to Optical Electronics
by K. A. Jones (Harper and Row, New York). E. Uiga provides more interfacing and design detail for the LED
as  a  circuit  element  in  optoelectronics  (Prentice-Hall,  Englewood  Cliffs,  NJ,  1995).  Wang  [1989]  considers
second-order effects extensively. In Semiconductor Optoelectronics by J. Singh (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1996),
the  emphasis  is  on  communications  applications,  but  the  temperature  dependence  and  frequency  response
issues covered there are also relevant to displays.
