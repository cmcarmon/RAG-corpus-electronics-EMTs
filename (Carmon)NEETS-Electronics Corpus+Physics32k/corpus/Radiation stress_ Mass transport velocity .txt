Propagating waves induce a – relatively small – mean mass transport in the wave propagation direction, also called the wave (pseudo) momentum. To lowest order, the wave momentum Mw is, per unit of horizontal area:






M


w


=


k

E

p




,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {M}}_{w}={\frac {\boldsymbol {k}}{k}}{\frac {E}{c_{p}}},}

which is exact for progressive waves of permanent form in irrotational flow. Above, cp is the phase speed relative to the mean flow:

{\displaystyle c_{p}={\frac {\sigma }{k}}\qquad {\text{with}}\qquad \sigma =\omega -{\boldsymbol {k}}\cdot {\overline {\boldsymbol {v}}},}

with σ the intrinsic angular frequency, as seen by an observer moving with the mean horizontal flow-velocity v while ω is the apparent angular frequency of an observer at rest (with respect to 'Earth'). The difference k⋅v is the Doppler shift.
The mean horizontal momentum M, also per unit of horizontal area, is the mean value of the integral of momentum over depth:

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {M}}={\overline {\int _{-h}^{\eta }\rho \,{\boldsymbol {v}}\;{\text{d}}z}}=\rho \,\left(h+{\overline {\eta }}\right){\overline {\boldsymbol {v}}}+{\boldsymbol {M}}_{w},}

with v(x,y,z,t) the total flow velocity at any point below the free surface z = η(x,y,t). The mean horizontal momentum M is also the mean of the depth-integrated horizontal mass flux, and consists of two contributions: one by the mean current and the other (Mw) is due to the waves.
Now the mass transport velocity u is defined as:

{\displaystyle {\overline {\boldsymbol {u}}}={\frac {\boldsymbol {M}}{\rho \,\left(h+{\overline {\eta }}\right)}}={\overline {\boldsymbol {v}}}+{\frac {{\boldsymbol {M}}_{w}}{\rho \,\left(h+{\overline {\eta }}\right)}}.}

Observe that first the depth-integrated horizontal momentum is averaged, before the division by the mean water depth (h+η) is made.
