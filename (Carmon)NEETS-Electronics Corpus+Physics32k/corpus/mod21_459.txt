STANDING WAVES are the result of an impedance mismatch between a transmission line and its
load. If a transmission line is not properly terminated, it will cause a percentage of the transmitter power
to be reflected back to the source. The reflected wave or standing wave will increase in magnitude as the
mismatch becomes greater.
