Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) (Schulzrinne et al.,
1998) is an out-of-band control protocol that allows the media
player to control the transmission of the media stream, includ-
ing functions like pause/resume and repositioning playback.
The use of the RTP above UDP provides for additional func-
tionality required for reordering and time stamping the UDP
packets. The inherent limitations of the UDP, however, are not
completely overcome by the use of RTP. Speciﬁcally, the unre-
liability of UDP persists and, consequently, there is no guaran-
tee of delivery of the transmitted packets at the receiver. On the
other hand, the error-free transmission guarantees provided by
the TCP pose severe time delays that render it useless for real-
time applications. Mulabegovic et al. (Mulabegovic et al.,
2002) have proposed an alternative to RTP provided by the
Lightweight Streaming Protocol (LSP). This protocol also re-
sides on top of the transport layer and relies on the UDP. LSP
provides sequence numbers and time stamps—as facilitated by
RTP—to reorder the packets and manage the buffer at the
receiver. However, unlike UDP and RTP, the LSP allows for
limited use of retransmissions to minimize the effects of error
over the communication network. This is accomplished by use
of negative acknowledgments in the event of lost packets and
satisfaction of timing delay constraints required to maintain
real-time communication capability.
