best prediction of x(tk) given x(tk–1), assuming that wk is a zero-mean random variable uncorrelated with x(tk–1).
Hence, the state vector prediction in the Kalman ﬁlter is intuitively exactly what one would expect. The state
vector update is also intuitively reasonable. In particular, it is a linear combination of the predicted value of x
and  the  latest  measurement  zk.  This  linear  combination  of  xk  and  zk  is  computed  as  a  compromise  between
prediction errors in xk and the measurement noise errors in zk. That is, the Kalman ﬁlter gain is computed to
optimally combine xk and zk, using the known models of system dynamics and measurements. More speciﬁcally,
the Kalman ﬁlter gain is computed to minimize the following error criterion at the time of the kth measurement:
