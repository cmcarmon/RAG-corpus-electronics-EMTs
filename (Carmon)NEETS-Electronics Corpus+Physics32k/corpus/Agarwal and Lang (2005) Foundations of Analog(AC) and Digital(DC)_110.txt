As an example, let us work out the numbers for a microprocessor. In a
microprocessor, the conductors are typically encased in insulators such as sil-
icon dioxide. These insulators have dielectric constants nearly four times that
of free space, and so electromagnetic waves travel only half as fast through
them. Electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of approximately 1 foot or
30 cm per nanosecond in vacuum, so they travel at roughly 6 inches or 15 cm
per nanosecond in the insulators. Since modern microprocessors (for exam-
ple, the Alpha microprocessor from Digital/Compaq) can approach 2.5 cm in
size, the propagation delay of electromagnetic waves across the chip is on the
order of 1/6 ns. These microprocessors are approaching a clock rate of 2 GHz
in 2001. Taking the reciprocal, this translates to a clock cycle time of 1/2 ns.
Thus, the wave propagation delay across the chip is about 33% of a clock
cycle. Although techniques such as pipelining attempt to reduce the number of
