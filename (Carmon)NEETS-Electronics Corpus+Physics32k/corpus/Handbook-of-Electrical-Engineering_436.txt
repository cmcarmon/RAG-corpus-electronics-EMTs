The  k-tree  topological  formulas  presented  in  this  section,  on  the  other  hand,  eliminate  completely  the
cancellation of terms. Also, they are particularly suited for digital computation when the size of the network
is  not  exceedingly  large.  All  of  the  terms  involved  in  the  formulas  can  be  computed  by  means  of  a  digital
compute using a single “tree-ﬁnding” program [Chan, 1969]. Thus, the application of topological formulas in
analyzing a network with the aid of a digital computer can mean a saving of a considerable amount of time
and  cost  to  the  circuit  designer,  especially  true  when  it  is  necessary  to  repeat  the  same  analysis  procedure  a
large number of times.
