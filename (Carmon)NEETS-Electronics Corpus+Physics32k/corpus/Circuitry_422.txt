remains constant (i.e. if it isnâ€™t changing) the output 
also remains constant. The faster the input voltage 
changes 
the  output  be.  In 
mathematics  this  is  equivalent  to  the  differential 
function.  
  Typical  input  and  output  waveforms  for  a 
differentiator  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.14.  Notice  how 
the  square  wave  input  is  converted  to  a  train  of 
short  duration  pulses  at  the  output.  Note  also  that 
the output waveform is inverted because the signal 
has  been  applied  to  the  inverting  input  of  the 
operational amplifier.
