Diodes are referred to as non-linear circuit elements because of the above characteristic
curve. For most applications the non-linear region can be avoided and the device can be
modeled by piece-wise linear circuit elements. Qualitatively we can just think of an ideal
diode has having two regions: a conduction region of zero resistance and an inÔ¨Ånite resistance
non-conduction region. For many circuit applications, this ideal diode model is an adequate
representation of an actual diode and simply requires that the circuit analysis be separated
into two parts: forward current and reverse current. Figure 4.4 shows a schematic symbol
for a diode and the current-voltage curve for an ideal diode.
