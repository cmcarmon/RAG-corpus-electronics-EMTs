B. As the name implies, bulk micromachining involves etch-
ing into the substrate to produce structures of interest. It can be
done with either wet or ‘‘dry’’ plasma processes, either of which
can attack the substrate in any direction (isotropically) or in
preferred directions (anisotropically). Bulk micromachining
has two primary variants. The ﬁrst depends on the remarkable
property of some wet chemical etches to attack single crystal
silicon as much as 600 times faster along some crystallographic
directions compared to others. This anisotropic process is called
orientation-dependent etching (ODE). It was known long
before the emergence of MEMS technologies and has become
