The term Minkowski diagram is used in both a generic and particular sense. In general, a Minkowski diagram is a two-dimensional graphical depiction of a portion of Minkowski space, usually where space has been curtailed to a single dimension. The units of measurement in these diagrams are taken such that the light cone at an event consists of the lines of slope plus or minus one through that event. The horizontal lines correspond to the usual notion of simultaneous events for a stationary observer at the origin.
A particular Minkowski diagram illustrates the result of a Lorentz transformation. The Lorentz transformation relates two inertial frames of reference, where an observer stationary at the event (0, 0) makes a change of velocity along the x-axis. The new time axis of the observer forms an angle α with the previous time axis, with α < π/4 (see the first figure on the right). In the new frame of reference the simultaneous events lie parallel to a line inclined by α to the previous lines of simultaneity. This is the new x-axis. Both the original set of axes and the primed set of axes have the property that they are orthogonal with respect to the Minkowski inner product or relativistic dot product.
Whatever the magnitude of α, the line t = x forms the universal bisector.
The space and time units of measurement on the axes may, for example, be taken as one of the following pairs:
Units of 30 centimetres length and nanoseconds
Astronomical units and intervals of 8 minutes and 20 seconds (500 seconds)
Light years and years
This way, light paths are represented by lines bisecting the axes.
