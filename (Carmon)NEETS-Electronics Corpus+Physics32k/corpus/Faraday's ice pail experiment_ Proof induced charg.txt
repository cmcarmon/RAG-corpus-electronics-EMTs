The result found in Procedure 5, that a charged object enclosed in a metal container induces an equal charge on the container, can be proved using Gauss's law. Assume the container A completely encloses the object C, without an opening (this assumption is explained below), and that C has a charge of Q coulombs. The electric field of the charge C will cause the charges in the volume of the metal to separate, creating regions of induced charge on the inside and outside surfaces of the shell. Now imagine a closed surface S inside the metal of the shell, between the inside and outside surfaces. Since S is in a conducting region (inside the volume of metal) where the electric field is zero, the electric field everywhere on the surface S is zero. Therefore, the total electric flux through the surface S must be zero. Therefore, from Gauss's law the total electric charge inside the surface S must be zero:

{\displaystyle \iint \limits _{S}\mathbf {E} \cdot d\mathbf {A} ={\frac {1}{\epsilon _{0}}}(Q+Q_{induced})=0\,}

The only charges inside S are the charge Q on the object C, and the induced charge Qinduced on the inside surface of the metal. Since the sum of these two charges is zero, the induced charge on the inside surface of the shell must have an equal but opposite value to the charge on C: Qinduced = −Q.
