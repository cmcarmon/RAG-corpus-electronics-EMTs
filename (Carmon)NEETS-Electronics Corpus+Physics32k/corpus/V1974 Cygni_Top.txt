V1974 Cygni or Nova Cygni 1992 was a relatively bright nova in the constellation Cygnus.
It was discovered on February 19, 1992, by Peter Collins. At that time it was magnitude 6, the maximum magnitude reached was 4.4. The hydrogen burning on the white dwarf ended two years later, in 1994. This nova was a neon nova. It is the first nova observed from onset to completion, and can be calculated to be 10,430 light years away from Earth.
It was also studied with the Hubble Space Telescope instrument the High Speed Photometer. The instrument recorded a short amount of ultraviolet photometry.
