One of the most widely used pieces of electronic test equipment is the OSCILLOSCOPE. An
oscilloscope is used to show the shape of a video pulse appearing at a selected equipment test point.
Although some oscilloscopes are better than others in accurately showing video pulses, all function in
fundamentally the same way. If you learn how one oscilloscope operates, you will be able to learn others.
