A more detailed treatment of this topic is found in Cadzow and Sun [1986]. This theorem must be carefully
interpreted in order not to inappropriately infer properties possessed by nonnegative sequences. For instance,
it is not true that the positive semideﬁniteness of a ﬁnite number of data matrices Xk implies that the underlying
time series is nonnegative. As an example, the length-three sequence with elements x(0) = 3, x(1) = x(–1) = 2
is  not  positive  although  the  data  matrix  X1  is  positive  deﬁnite.  In  a  similar  fashion,  this  theorem  does  not
indicate that the symmetric truncation of a nonnegative sequence is itself nonnegative.
