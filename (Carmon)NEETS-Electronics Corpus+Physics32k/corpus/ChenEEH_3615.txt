Example
Design FIR using some WLS-Chebyshev ﬁlters by satisfy-
ing the following speciﬁcations: Ap ¼ 0:02 dB, Ar ¼ 32 dB,
vp ¼ 2p  3400 rad=sec, vr ¼ 2p  4600 rad=sec, vs ¼ 2p
20, 000 rad=sec. These are speciﬁcations established by in-
dustry standards for preﬁltering speech signals before these
signals are subsampled to 8kHz.
