In atomic and nuclear physics, the Greek symbol Î¼ represents the magnitude of the magnetic moment, often measured in Bohr magnetons or nuclear magnetons, associated with the intrinsic spin of the particle and/or with the orbital motion of the particle in a system. Values of the intrinsic magnetic moments of some particles are given in the table below:

For relation between the notions of magnetic moment and magnetization see magnetization.
