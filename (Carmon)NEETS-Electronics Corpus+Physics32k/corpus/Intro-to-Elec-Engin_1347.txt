Figure 14.3.7(b) depicts the variation of noise temperature with frequency for a nonthermal
source. Several phenomena lumped together under the term one-over-f (1/f ) noise lead to the
pronounced low-frequency rise in Figure 14.3.7(b). Such 1/f noise is produced by transistors
and certain transducers, such as photodiodes and optical sensors.
