In ammeter designs, external resistors added to extend the usable range of the movement
are connected in parallel with the movement rather than in series as is the case for voltmeters.
This is because we want to divide the measured current, not the measured voltage, going to
the movement, and because current divider circuits are always formed by parallel resistances.
