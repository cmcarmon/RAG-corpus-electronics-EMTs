The  feedwater  enters  through  the  economizer  to  the  boiler,  which
consists of riser tubes that line the furnace wall. All the water is converted
to steam and fed directly to the superheater. The latter increases the steam
temperature  above  the  critical  temperature  of  the  water  and  drives  the
turbine.  The  construction  of  these  steam  generators  is  more  expensive
than the drum-type units but has a higher operating efﬁciency.
