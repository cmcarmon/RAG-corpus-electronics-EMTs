The controlled load service is described only using a Tspec.
Since the network does not give any quantitative guarantees,
Rspec is not required. The controlled load ﬂows not experi-
encing excess trafﬁc will get the contracted quality of service,
and the network elements will prevent excess controlled load
trafﬁc from unfairly impacting the handling of arriving best-
effort trafﬁc. The excess trafﬁc will be forwarded on a best-
effort basis.
