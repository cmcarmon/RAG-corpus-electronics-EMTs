You  might  like  to  compare  this  with  the  similar 
relationship  that  we  obtained  for  the  current 
flowing in a capacitor shown on page 33. 
 
Example 2.27 
 
A current  increases  at  a  uniform  rate  from  2  A  to  
6 A in a period of 250 ms. If this current is applied 
to  an  inductor  of  600  mH,  determine  the  voltage 
induced. 
 
Solution 
 
Now the induced voltage will be given by: 
 
e = (cid:1)L Ã— (rate of change of current) 
 
Thus
