When the input signals are not 180 degrees out of phase, the combined output signal taken across
output one and output two is similar to the output that you were shown for the two-input, single-output,
difference amplifier. The differential amplifier can have two outputs (180 degrees out of phase with each
other), or the outputs can be combined as shown in figure 3-9.
