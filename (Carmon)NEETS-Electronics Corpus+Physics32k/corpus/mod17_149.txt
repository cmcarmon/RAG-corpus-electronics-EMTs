The buffer stage or first intermediate power amplifier stage (referred to as the ipa) is a voltage
amplifier that increases the amplitude of the oscillator signal to a level that drives the power amplifier
(pa). You will find the signal delivered by the buffer varies with the type of transmitter and may be
hundreds or thousands of volts.
