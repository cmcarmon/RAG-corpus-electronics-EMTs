A linear system of equations can also be represented diagrammatically by a signal-ﬂow graph
(consisting of nodes and branches), which is used to describe a system schematically in terms of
its constituent parts. However, in view of the scope of this text, the topic of signal-ﬂow graph is
not presented.
