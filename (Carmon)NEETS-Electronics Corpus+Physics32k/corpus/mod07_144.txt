There are many known metal-semiconductor combinations that can be used for contact rectification.
Copper oxide and selenium devices are by far the most popular. Copper oxide and selenium are
frequently used over other types of metallic rectifiers because they have a large forward current per unit
contact area, low forward voltage drop, good stability, and a lower aging rate. In practical application, the
selenium rectifier is used where a relatively large amount of power is required. On the other hand,
copper-oxide rectifiers are generally used in small-current applications such as ac meter movements or for
delivering direct current to circuits requiring not more than 10 amperes.
