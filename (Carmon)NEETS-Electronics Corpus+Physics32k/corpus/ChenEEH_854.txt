In this section, a graphical model used to represent fully
synchronous digital systems is introduced. The purpose of this
model is twofold. First, the model provides a common abstract
framework for the automated analysis of circuits by com-
puters, and second, it permits a signiﬁcant reduction of the
size of the data that needs to be stored in the computer
memory when performing analysis and optimization proced-
ures on a circuit. This graph-based model can be arrived at in a
natural way by observing what constitutes relevant system
information (in terms of the clock skew scheduling problem).
For example, it is sufﬁcient to know that a pair of registers
hRi, Rji are sequentially adjacent, whereas knowing the speciﬁc
functional
logic
gates along the signal paths between Ri and Rj is not necessary.
Consider, for instance, the system shown in Figure 4.1. This
system is completely described (for the purpose of clock skew
scheduling) by the timing information describing the four
registers, four logic gates, ten wires (nets), and the connectivity
of these wires to the registers and logic gates. Consider next the
abstract representation of this system shown in Figure 4.3.
Note that the registers R1 through R4 are represented by the
vertices of the graph shown in Figure 4.3. However, the logic
gates and wires have been replaced in Figure 4.3 by arrows, or
arcs, representing the signal paths among the registers. The
four logic gates and ten nets in the original system have been
reduced to only six local data paths represented by the arcs. For
clarity, each arc, or edge, is labeled with the logic gates4 along
the signal path represented by this speciﬁc arc.
