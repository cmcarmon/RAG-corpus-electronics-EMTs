. Secondary memory is much larger in capacity and much
slower in access time than main memory. Secondary
memory stores information that is not currently used by
the CPU. In addition, it also absorbs from the main
memory when it is exceedingly used. Examples of second-
ary memory are a hard disk, a compact disk read-only
memory (CD-ROM) disk, a digital video disc (DVD),
now called a digital versatile disc, a digital audio tape
(DAT), a ﬂoppy disk, and a magnetic tape. For hard
drives, the typical capacity varies from 0.5 GB to several
GB (1 GB is 230 bytes), and the access time is measured in
milliseconds. For ﬂoppy drives, the capacity varies from
one to hundreds of MB (in case of Zip drives and Super
drives).
