A  computer  usually  consists  of  four  major  components:  the  arithmetic-logic  unit  (ALU),  the  main  memory
unit (MU), the input/output unit (I/O), and the control unit (CU). Such a computer is known as a uniprocessor
since  the  processing  is  achieved  by  operating  on  one  word  or  word  pair  at  a  time.  In  order  to  increase  the
computer  performance,  we  may  improve  the  device  technology  to  reduce  the  switching  (gate  delay)  time.
Indeed,  for  the  past  half  century  we  have  seen  switching  speeds  improve  from  200  to  300 ms  for  relays  to
present-day subnanosecond very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits. As the switching speeds of computer
devices approach a limit, however, any further signiﬁcant improvement in performance is more likely to be in
increasing the number of words or word pairs that can be processed simultaneously. For example, we may use
N
 times in a uniprocessor, or we may design a computer system with
one ALU to compute 
N
N
  sets  once.  Conceptually,  such  a  computer  system  may  still  consist  of  the  four  major

 ALUs. An organization with multiple ALUs under

(PE). Figure 95.1 shows a

block diagram of a parallel processor.
