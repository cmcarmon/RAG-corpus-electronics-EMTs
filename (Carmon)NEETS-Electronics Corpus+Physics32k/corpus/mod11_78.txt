The efficiency of conventional tubes is largely independent of frequency up to a certain limit. When 
frequency increases beyond that limit, several factors combine to rapidly decrease tube efficiency. Tubes 
that are efficient in the microwave range usually operate on the theory of VELOCITY MODULATION, a 
concept that avoids the problems encountered in conventional tubes. Velocity modulation is more easily 
understood if the factors that limit the frequency range of a conventional tube are thoroughly understood. 
Therefore, the frequency limitations of conventional tubes will be discussed before the concepts and 
applications of velocity modulation are explained. You may want to review NEETS, Module 6, 
Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes, and Power Supplies, Chapters 1 and 2, for a refresher on 
vacuum tubes before proceeding.
