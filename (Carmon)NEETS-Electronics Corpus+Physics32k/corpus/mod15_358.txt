To overcome this difficulty, the point where the torque is applied must be moved. The torque point is 
moved by causing the gimbal assembly to slowly and continuously rotate in the proper direction. This is 
done in the following manner. With a small mercury tube, the mercury will take nearly a second to find 
its level. At the same time the mercury is flowing, a small motor is rotating the gimbal supporting the 
gyro about 18 times a minute. Therefore, during the time that it takes the mercury to flow into the low 
tank, the entire gimbal assembly has rotated 90ยบ. The torque will now be applied at a point which causes 
the gyro to precess in the proper direction to maintain the gyro spin axis in a vertical position.
