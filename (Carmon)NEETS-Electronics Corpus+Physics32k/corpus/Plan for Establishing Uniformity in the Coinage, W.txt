The revolutionary system was quite similar to the metric system, except the difference of about 5.5 mm between the second pendulum at 45Â° and the 10,000th part of the distance from the north pole to the equator, which became the first definition of the metre. Also it didn't have the concept of prefixes. A very similar system was a base of discussion in France after the revolution of July 14, 1789, with Jefferson observing.
In distinguishing this from the less radical changes proposed in the first alternative, the report stated:
The transcript of the original document gives the value of a kental as 16 stones at one point and 10 stones in another point. 10 was presumably the intended value, given the otherwise consistent decimalization.
Depending on exactly which definition of the foot was to have been used, the actual values of the base units would have been:
Foot
331.4 mm or 298.3 mm (for comparison, the modern foot is 304.8 mm)
Bushel
36.43 L or 26.54 L (a modern US bushel is c. 35.24 L)
Ounce
36.43 g or 26.54 g (a modern Avoirdupois ounce is c. 28.35 g)
