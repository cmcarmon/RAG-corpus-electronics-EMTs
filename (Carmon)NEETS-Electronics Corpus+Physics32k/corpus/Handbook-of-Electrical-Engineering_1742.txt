The  Fourier  slice  theorem  may  be  used  to  develop  two  methods  for  inverting  the  Radon  transform  and
thereby  computing  the  image  f.  The  ﬁrst  method,  known  as  ﬁltered  back  projection,  computes  the  inverse
Fourier transform in polar coordinates using the transformed projection data.
