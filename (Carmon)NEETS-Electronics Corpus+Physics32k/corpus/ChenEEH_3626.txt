If magnitude truncation is used to quantize particular
signals in some ﬁlter structures,
it can be shown that it
is possible to eliminate zero-input limit cycles. As a conse-
quence, these digital ﬁlters are free of overﬂow limit cycles
when overﬂow nonlinearities, such as saturation arithmetic,
are used.
