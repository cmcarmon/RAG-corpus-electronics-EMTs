Maurice Allais proposed in 1959 an aether hypothesis involving a wind velocity of about 8 km/s, much lower than the standard value of 30 km/s supported by scientists of the nineteenth century, and compatible with the Michelsonâ€“Morley and the Dayton Miller experiments, as well as his own experiments regarding the controversial Allais effect unpredictable by general relativity. Despite advocating for the need of another theory of gravity, his hypothesis didn't gain significant traction amongst mainstream scientists.
