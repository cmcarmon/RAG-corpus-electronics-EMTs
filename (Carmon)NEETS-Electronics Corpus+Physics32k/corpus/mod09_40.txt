Many different signals reach the antenna of a radio receiver at the same time. To select a station, the 
listener adjusts the tuning dial on the radio receiver until the desired station is heard. Within the radio or 
TV receiver, the actual "selecting" of the desired signal and the rejecting of the unwanted signals are 
accomplished by what is called a TUNED CIRCUIT. A tuned circuit consists of a coil and a capacitor 
connected in series or parallel. Later in this chapter you will see the application and advantages of both 
series- and parallel-tuned circuits. Whenever the characteristics of inductance and capacitance are found 
in a tuned circuit, the phenomenon as RESONANCE takes place.
