test leads, but you can purchase higher‐quality coiled leads that stretch 
out to several feet and recoil to a manageable length when not in 
use. You may also want to purchase spring‐loaded clip leads (refer to 
Figure 16-2). Some multimeters with removable test leads provide more 
than two receptacles for the leads. You insert the black test lead into the 
receptacle labeled GROUND or COM, but the red lead may be inserted 
into a different receptacle depending on what function and range you 
dial up. Many meters provide additional input sockets for testing capaci-
tors and transistors, as shown in the photo on the left in Figure 16-5.
