An ordinary ohmmeter cannot be used for measuring resistance of multimillions of ohms, such as in
conductor insulation. To adequately test for insulation break down, it is necessary to use a much higher
potential than is furnished by the battery of an ohmmeter. This potential is placed between the conductor
and the outside surface of the insulation.
