The only difference in the setup of the meter is the placement of the selector switch: it is
now turned to AC ”V”. Since we’re still measuring voltage, the test leads will remain plugged
in the same sockets. In both of these examples, it is imperative that you not let the probe tips
come in contact with one another while they are both in contact with their respective points on
the circuit. If this happens, a short-circuit will be formed, creating a spark and perhaps even a
ball of ﬂame if the voltage source is capable of supplying enough current! The following image
illustrates the potential for hazard:
