As  with  the  Cartesian  robot,  the  cylindrical  robot  is  well  suited  for
straight-line vertical and horizontal motions, so it is useful for assembly
and  machine  loading  operations.  It  is  capable  of  higher  speeds  in  the
horizontal  plane  due  to  the  rotary  base.  However,  general  horizontal
straight-line motion is more complex and correspondingly more difÔ¨Å-
cult to coordinate. Additionally, the end-point resolution of the cylin-
drical  robot  is  not  constant  but  depends  on  the  extension  of  the
horizontal linkage. A cylindrical robot cannot reach around obstacles.
Additionally,  if  a  monomast  construction  is  used  on  the  horizontal
linkage, then there can be clearance problems behind the robot.
