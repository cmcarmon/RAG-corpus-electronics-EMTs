View (D) of figure 2-22. shows how the magnetron plate current varies under the influence of the 
varying magnetic field. In view (A), the electron flow reaches the plate, so a large amount of plate current 
is flowing. However, when the critical field value is reached, as shown in view (B), the electrons are 
deflected away from the plate and the plate current then drops quickly to a very small value. When the 
field strength is made still greater, as shown in view (C), the plate current drops to zero.
