Gantry robots have many advantageous properties. They are geometrically simple, like the Cartesian robot,
with the corresponding kinematic and dynamic simplicity. For the same reasons, the gantry robot has a constant
arm resolution throughout the workspace. The gantry robot has better dynamics than the pedestal-mounted
Cartesian  robot,  as  its  links  are  not  cantilevered.  One  major  advantage  over  revolute-base  robots  is  that  its
dynamics  vary  much  less  over  the  workspace.  This  leads  to  less  vibration  and  more  even  performance  than
typical pedestal-mounted robots in full extension. Gantry robots are much stiffer than other robot conﬁgura-
tions,  although  they  are  still  much  less  stiff  than  Numerical  Control  (NC)  machines.  The  gantry  robot  can
straddle a workstation, or several workstations for a large system, so that one gantry robot can perform the
work of several pedestal-mounted robots. As with the Cartesian robot, the gantry robot’s simple geometry is
similar to that of an NC machine, so technicians will be more familiar with the system and require less training
time. Also, there is no need for special path or trajectory computations. A gantry robot can be programmed
directly from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) system with the appropriate interface, and straight-line motions
are  particularly  simple  to  program.  Large  gantry  robots  have  a  very  high  payload  capacity.  Small,  table-top
systems  can  achieve  linear  speeds  of  up  to  40 in./s  (1.025 m/s),  with  a  payload  capacity  of  5.0 lb  (2.26 kg),
making them suitable for assembly operations. However, most gantry robot systems are not as precise as other
conﬁgurations, such as the SCARA conﬁguration. Additionally, it is sometimes more difﬁcult to apply a gantry
robot to an existing workstation, as the workpieces must be brought into the gantry’s work envelope, which
may be harder to do than for a pedestal-mounted manipulator.
