Transistor packages 
 
A wide  variety  of  packaging  styles  are  used  for 
transistors.  Small-signal  transistors  tend  to  have 
either  plastic  packages  (e.g.  TO92)  or  miniature 
metal cases (e.g. TO5 or TO18). Medium and high-
power devices may also be supplied in plastic cases 
but  these  are  normally  fitted  with  integral  metal 
heat-sinking tabs (e.g. TO126, TO218 or TO220) in 
order to conduct heat away from the junction. Some 
older power transistors are supplied in metal cases 
(either  TO3  or  TO3).  Several  popular  transistor 
case styles are shown in Fig. 5.34.
