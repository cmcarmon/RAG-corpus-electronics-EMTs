Multispeed synchro systems use more than one speed of data transmission. The speed of data 
transmission is, simply, the number of times a synchro transmitter rotor must turn to transmit a full range 
of values. For example, a system in which the rotors of synchro devices turn in unison with their input 
and output shafts is commonly called a 1-speed data transmission system. In this system, the transmitter's 
rotor is geared so that 1 revolution of the rotor corresponds to 1 revolution of the input. Until now, the 
discussion of synchro systems has dealt exclusively with this 1-speed system.
