The  rating  of  an  overhead  transmission  line  is  based  on  the  maximum  temperature  of  the  conductors.
Conductor  temperature  affects  the  conductor  sag  between  towers  and  the  loss  of  conductor  tensile  strength
due to annealing. If the temperature is too high, proscribed conductor-to-ground clearances [ANSI, 1993] may
not  be  met,  or  the  elastic  limit  of  the  conductor  may  be  exceeded  such  that  it  cannot  shrink  to  its  original
length when cooled. Conductor temperature depends on the current magnitude and its time duration, as well
as on ambient temperature, wind velocity, solar radiation, and conductor surface conditions. Standard assump-
tions  on  ambient  temperature,  wind  velocity,  etc.,  are  selected,  often  conservatively,  to  calculate  overhead
transmission line ratings [ANSI/IEEE Std. 738â€“85, 1985]. It is common practice to have summer and winter
normal line ratings, based on seasonal ambient temperature differences. Also, in locations with higher prevailing
winds, such as coastal areas, larger normal line ratings may be selected. Emergency line ratings typically vary
from 110 to 120% of normal ratings. Recently, real-time monitoring of actual conductor temperatures along
a transmission line has been used for on-line dynamic transmission line ratings [Henke and Sciacca, 1989].
