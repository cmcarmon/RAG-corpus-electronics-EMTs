Soldering	is	a	process	that	involves	(at	least)	2	metals	(or	any	conductive
material);	the	2	metals	are	joined	by	flowing	and	melting.	In	the	industry	of
circuitry,	it	is	one	of	the	most	fundamental	methods	in	circuit	creation;	it
allows	independent	components	to	work	as	one.
A	technique	of	good	soldering	revolves	around	the	knowledge	of	the	amount	of
heat	that	is	applied.	For	basic	soldering,	361F	is	the	temperature	to	consider
and	for	advanced	soldering,	the	goal	is	to	arrive	at	a	temperature	of	somewhere
between	361F	to	419F.
