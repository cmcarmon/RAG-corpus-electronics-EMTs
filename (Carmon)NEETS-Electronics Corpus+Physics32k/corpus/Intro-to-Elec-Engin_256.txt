Note that in all three cases [see Equations (3.2.34), (3.2.35), and (3.2.38)] with nonzero α‘s
the transient solution will eventually decay to zero as time progresses. The transient solution is
said to be overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped, corresponding to Cases 1, 2, and
3, respectively. Justiﬁcation of the statement can be found from the solution of the following
example.
