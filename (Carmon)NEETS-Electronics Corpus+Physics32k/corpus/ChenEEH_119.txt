The ﬁrst step in circuit analysis is formulation of equations.
This section modiﬁes the nodal analysis method described in
Chapter 1 of this book’s Section 1 to include different types of
elements in the formulation. Recall that in nodal analysis,
Kirchhoff ’s current law (KCL) is used to write equations at
each node in terms of the nodal voltages and element values.
The equations are written for one node at a time, and the node
voltages are unknown variables. In CAD, it is useful to consider
