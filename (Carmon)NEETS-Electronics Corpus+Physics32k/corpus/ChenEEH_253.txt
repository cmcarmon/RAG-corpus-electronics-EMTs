the
ventional buck and synchronous buck topologies,
output ﬁlter inductance is reduced signiﬁcantly. At a 13-A
load and a 300-kHz switching frequency, the QSW circuit
needs only a 160-nH inductor, as compared with the
2  4 mH inductor needed in the conventional design. This
small inductance makes the VRM transient response much
faster. Figure 1.14 shows the transient response of the QSW
topology. The third spike of the output voltage becomes insig-
niﬁcant, and the second spike is reduced signiﬁcantly.
