Lastly, letâ€™s look at the top portion of the curve. The plate current plotted here is produced by the
higher plate voltages. However, the amount of current change for a given voltage change is greatly
reduced. The reason for this again involves the space charge. At about 300 volts, almost all of the
electrons in the space charge are flowing to the plate. A higher voltage cannot attract more electrons
because the cathode cannot produce any more. The point where all (or almost all) available electrons are
being drawn to the plate is called PLATE SATURATION or just SATURATION. This is one of the
limiting factors of every tube.
