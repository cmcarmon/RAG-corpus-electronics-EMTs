Vectorscope: An oscilloscope-type device used to display the color parameters of a video signal. A vectorscope
decodes color information into R-Y and B-Y components, which are then used to drive the X and Y axis
of the scope. The total lack of color in a video signal is displayed as a dot in the center of the vectorscope.
The angle, distance around the circle, magnitude, and distance away from the center indicate the phase
and amplitude of the color signal.
