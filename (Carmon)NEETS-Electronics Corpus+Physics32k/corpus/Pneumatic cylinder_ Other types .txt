Although SACs and DACs are the most common types of pneumatic cylinder, the following types are not particularly rare:
Through rod air cylinders: piston rod extends through both sides of the cylinder, allowing for equal forces and speeds on either side.
Cushion end air cylinders: cylinders with regulated air exhaust to avoid impacts between the piston rod and the cylinder end cover.
Rotary air cylinders: actuators that use air to impart a rotary motion.
Rodless air cylinders: These have no piston rod. They are actuators that use a mechanical or magnetic coupling to impart force, typically to a table or other body that moves along the length of the cylinder body, but does not extend beyond it.
Tandem air cylinder: two cylinders assembled in series
Impact air cylinder: high velocity cylinders with specially designed end covers that withstand the impact of extending or retracting piston rods.
