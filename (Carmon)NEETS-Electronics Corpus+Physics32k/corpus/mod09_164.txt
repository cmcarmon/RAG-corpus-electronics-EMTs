In such applications where the current has different frequency components, it is usually necessary for 
the filter either to accept or reject one frequency or a group of frequencies. The electronic filter that can 
pass on the higher-frequency components to a load or to the next circuit is known as a HIGH-PASS filter. 
A LOW-PASS filter can be used to pass on lower-frequency components.
