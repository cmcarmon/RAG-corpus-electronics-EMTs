Serial and parallel are terms used to describe the method in which data or information is moved from
one place to another. SERIAL TRANSFER means that the data is moved along a single line one bit at a
time. A control pulse is required to move each bit. PARALLEL TRANSFER means that each bit of data
is moved on its own line and that all bits transfer simultaneously as they did in the parallel register. A
single control pulse is required to move all bits.
