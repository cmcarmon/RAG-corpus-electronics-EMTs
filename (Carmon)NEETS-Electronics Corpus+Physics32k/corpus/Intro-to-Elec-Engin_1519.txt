Time-division multiple access (TDMA) is an important means by which each station on earth
timeshares the communication satellite in the sky, and broadcasts to all other stations during its
assigned time. Figure 15.3.13 shows the communication links of several (N) earth stations that
communicate with each other through satellite. All stations use the same up-link frequency, and
all receive a single down-link frequency from the satellite.
