If the voltage on the line is 5 V, how much energy is stored in its capacitance per 10 cm
of length? If the current through the line is 1 A, how much energy is stored in its
inductance per 10 cm of length?
e x e r c i s e 9.4 A current source drives a capacitor as shown in Figure 9.57. The
source current is as shown in Figure 9.58 for 0 ≤ t ≤ T. If the capacitor voltage is V◦ at
t = T, what was it at t = 0?
