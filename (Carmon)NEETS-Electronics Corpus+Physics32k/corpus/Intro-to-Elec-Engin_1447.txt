Frequency Modulation
So far we have considered AM of the carrier as a means for transmitting the message signal.
AM methods are also known as linear modulation methods, although conventional AM is not
linear in the strict sense. Other classes of modulation methods are frequency modulation (FM)
and phase modulation (PM). In FM systems the frequency of the carrier fc is changed by the
message signal, and in PM systems the phase of the carrier is changed according to the variations
of the message signal. FM and PM, which are quite nonlinear, are referred to as angle-modulation
methods. Angle modulation is more complex to implement and much more difﬁcult to analyze
because of its inherent nonlinearity. FM and PM systems generally expand the bandwidth such
that the effective bandwidth of the modulated signal is usually many times the bandwidth of the
message signal. The major beneﬁt of these systems is their high degree of noise immunity. Trading
off bandwidth for high-noise immunity, the FM systems are widely used in high-ﬁdelity music
broadcasting and point-to-point communication systems where the transmitter power is rather
limited.
