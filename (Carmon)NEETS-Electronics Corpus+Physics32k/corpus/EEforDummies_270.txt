Circuit designs usually tell you the safe 
resistor tolerance to use, whether for 
each individual resistor or for all the 
resistors in the circuit. Look for a nota­
tion in the parts list or as a footnote in the circuit diagram. If the schematic 
doesn’t state a tolerance, you can assume it’s okay to use standard‐tolerance 
resistors (±5% or ±10%).
