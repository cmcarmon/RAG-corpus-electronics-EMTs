Linear Region
With a small positive voltage on the drain and no bias on the
gate (i.e., VDS > 0 and VGS ¼ 0), the drain is a reverse-biased
pn junction. Conduction band electrons in the source region
encounter a potential barrier determined by the built-in
potential of the source junction. As a result, electrons cannot
enter the channel region and, hence, no current ﬂows from the
source to the drain. This is referred to as the off state. With a
small positive bias on the gate, band bending in the channel
region (cs > 0) brings the conduction band in the channel
region closer to the conduction band in the source region, thus
reducing the height of the potential barrier to electrons. Elec-
trons can now enter the channel and a current ﬂow from
source to drain is established.
