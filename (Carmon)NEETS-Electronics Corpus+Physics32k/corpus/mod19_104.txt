PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SHOCK.Â—You should begin treatment for shock as 
soon as possible. Prompt treatment may prevent the occurrence of shock or, if it has already developed, 
prevent its reaching a critical point. Keep the victim lying down and warm. If conscious, the victim 
should be encouraged and assured that expert medical help will arrive soon.
