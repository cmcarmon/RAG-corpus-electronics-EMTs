Two bit slices of a 6-bit FT Wallace tree multiplier are
obtained using the ‘‘bit-slice-and-add’’ approach, shown in
Figure 8.4. A 16-bit version was also laid out. Table 8.2 com-
pares the area and time overheads of REMOD multipliers
to those of other FT multipliers. Of the error-correcting
multipliers, error-correcting RESO has the lowest area over-
head, but its time overhead of up to 300% is extremely high.
