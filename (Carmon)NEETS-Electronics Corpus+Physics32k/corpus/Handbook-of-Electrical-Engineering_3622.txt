A  feature  of  the  present
invention resides in the use of photoelec-
tric  or  photoconductive  materials  for
photographic purposes.  In its preferred
form  the  invention  involves  the  use  of
materials  which  are  insulators  in  the
dark  but  become  partial  conductors
when  illuminated.    These  materials
respond  to  light,  being  slightly  conduc-
tive whenever they are illuminated and
again  becoming  insulating  when  the
light is cut off.  They can be called pho-
toconductive insulating materials.
