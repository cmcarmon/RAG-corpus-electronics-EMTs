This is considered a good playoff system, as while it allows fifth place to take part, it is incredibly difficult for them to be crowned champions as they must beat every team from above them at some point.
In elite Australian Rules Football, the only team to win from fifth under this system was Norwood in the SANFL in 1984. No AFL/VFL team won from fifth under this format (1972â€“1990), and no WAFL team has won under this format as of 2016.
