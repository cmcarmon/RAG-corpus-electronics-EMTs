Resistance is usually measured with direct current for maximum accuracy. The model 250DE bridge
can be used to measure resistance with alternating current, but external reactance compensation is usually
required. On high-resistance ranges, care should be taken to avoid leakage across a resistor under test.
Insulation with a resistance of 109 ohms, which is adequate for most purposes, will cause a measurement
