(a) Express each as a sum of complex exponentials. Also, re-express each as the real and imaginary parts
of a complex exponential. What is the frequency (in Hz) of each? In general, are your answers unique?
If so, prove it; if not, Ô¨Ånd an alternative answer for the complex exponential representation.
