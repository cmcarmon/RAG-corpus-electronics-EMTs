Rings of superconducting material have been experimentally proven to sustain continuous
current for years with no applied voltage. So far as anyone knows, there is no theoretical
time limit to how long an unaided current could be sustained in a superconducting circuit.
If you’re thinking this appears to be a form of perpetual motion, you’re correct! Contrary to
popular belief, there is no law of physics prohibiting perpetual motion; rather, the prohibi-
tion stands against any machine or system generating more energy than it consumes (what
would be referred to as an over-unity device). At best, all a perpetual motion machine (like the
superconducting ring) would be good for is to store energy, not generate it freely!
