Statements  of  a  language  can  be  both  syntactically  and  semantically  correct  and  still  be  unsuitable  for
computer languages. For example, the phrase “. . . time ﬂies . . .” has two meanings: one as an expression of
clock speed, and the other as a reference to a species of insects. Therefore, we add one other requirement for
computer languages: there must be only one meaning attached to each syntactically correct statement of the
language. That is, the language must be unambiguous.
