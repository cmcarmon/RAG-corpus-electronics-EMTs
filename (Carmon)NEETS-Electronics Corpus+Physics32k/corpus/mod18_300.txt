SYNTHESIZER to produce the transmitted frequency rather than the heterodyning mixer. The frequency
synthesizer allows the transmitter to radiate a large number of discrete frequencies over a relatively wide
band. Such a system is commonly used with frequency-scan search radars that must transmit many
different frequencies to achieve elevation coverage and to compensate for the roll and pitch of a ship.
