This  section  summarizes  the  design  process,  the  gate-level  physical  design,  and  several  issues  which  have
become  particularly  important  with  todayâ€™s  VLSI  technologies,  with  a  focus  on  ASICs.  An  important  and
growing issue is that of testing, including built-in testing, design for testability, and related topics (see e.g., Jha
and Kundu [1990] and Parker [1992]). This is a broad topic, beyond the scope of this section.
