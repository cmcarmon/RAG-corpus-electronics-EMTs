6.8   The  following  data  were  obtained  during  a 
 
load test carried out on a d.c. power supply: 
Output voltage (no-load) = 8.5 V 
 
Output voltage (800 mA load) = 8.1V 
 
Determine the output resistance of the power 
 
 
supply  and  estimate  the  output  voltage  at  a 
 
load current of 400 mA. 
6.9   The  following  data  were  obtained  during  a 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.10  Figure  6.38  shows  a  switching  regulator 
circuit that produces an output of 9 V for an 
 
input  of    4.5  V.  What  type  of    regulator  is 
 
this?  Between  which  pins  of  IC1  is  the 
 
 
switching 
transistor  connected?  Which 
pin on IC1 is used to feed back a proportion 
 
of 
 
internal 
 
comparator stage?
