Sounding off with buzzers
Like speakers, buzzers generate sound — but unlike speakers, buzzers indis-
criminately produce the same obnoxious sound no matter what voltage you 
apply (within reason). With speakers, “Mozart in” creates “Mozart out”; with 
buzzers, “Mozart in” creates nothin’ but noise.
