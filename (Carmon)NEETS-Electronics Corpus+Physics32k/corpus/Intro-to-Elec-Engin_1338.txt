Any conductive two-terminal device is characterized generally as lossy, with some resistance
R. A resistor, which is at a temperature τ above absolute zero, contains free electrons that exhibit
random motion and, thus, result in a noise voltage across the terminals of the resistor. Such a noise
voltage is known as thermal noise. If the noise is introduced primarily by electronic components
and ampliﬁers at the receiver, it may be characterized as thermal noise.
