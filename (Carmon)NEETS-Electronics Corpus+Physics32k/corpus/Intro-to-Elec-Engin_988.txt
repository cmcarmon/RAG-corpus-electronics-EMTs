A loudspeaker is a common electrochemical transducer in which vibration is caused by changes in
the input current to a coil which, in turn, is coupled to a magnetic structure that can produce time-
varying forces on the loudspeaker diaphragm. Figure E12.1.3(a) shows the schematic diagram of
a loudspeaker, Figure E12.1.3(b) is a simpliÔ¨Åed model, Figure E12.1.3(c) is a free-body diagram
of the forces acting on the loudspeaker diaphragm, and Figure E12.1.3(d) is the electrical model.
The force exerted on the coil is also exerted on the mass of the loudspeaker diaphragm.
