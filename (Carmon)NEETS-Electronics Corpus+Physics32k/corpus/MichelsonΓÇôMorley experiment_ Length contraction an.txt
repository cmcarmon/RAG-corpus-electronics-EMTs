A first step to explaining the Michelson and Morley experiment's null result was found in the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis, now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Lorentz (1892). According to this law all objects physically contract by



L

/

γ


{\displaystyle L/\gamma }
along the line of motion (originally thought to be relative to the aether),



γ
=
1

/

v

/


c

{\displaystyle \gamma =1/{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}
being the Lorentz factor. This hypothesis was partly motivated by Oliver Heaviside's discovery in 1888, that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion. But since there was no reason at that time to assume that binding forces in matter are of electric origin, length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an Ad hoc hypothesis.
If length contraction of



L


{\displaystyle L}
is inserted into the above formula for




T

l




{\displaystyle T_{l}}
, then the light propagation time in the longitudinal direction becomes equal to that in the transverse direction:

However, length contraction is only a special case of the more general relation, according to which the transverse length is larger than the longitudinal length by the ratio



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
. This can be achieved in many ways. If




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}
is the moving longitudinal length and




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}
the moving transverse length,




L

1

′

=

L

2

{\displaystyle L'_{1}=L'_{2}}
being the rest lengths, then it is given:

{\displaystyle {\frac {L_{2}}{L_{1}}}={\frac {L'_{2}}{\phi }}\left/{\frac {L'_{1}}{\gamma \phi }}\right.=\gamma .}





ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
can be arbitrarily chosen, so there are infinitely many combinations to explain the Michelson–Morley null result. For instance, if



ϕ
=
1


{\displaystyle \phi =1}
the relativistic value of length contraction of




L

1




{\displaystyle L_{1}}
occurs, but if



ϕ
=
1

/

γ


{\displaystyle \phi =1/\gamma }
then no length contraction but an elongation of




L

2




{\displaystyle L_{2}}
occurs. This hypothesis was later extended by Joseph Larmor (1897), Lorentz (1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), who developed the complete Lorentz transformation including time dilation in order to explain the Trouton–Noble experiment, the Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace, and Kaufmann's experiments. It has the form





x

)



{\displaystyle x'=\gamma \phi (x-vt),\ y'=\phi y,\ z'=\phi z,\ t'=\gamma \phi \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)}

It remained to define the value of



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
, which was shown by Lorentz (1904) to be unity. In general, Poincaré (1905) demonstrated that only



ϕ
=
1


{\displaystyle \phi =1}
allows this transformation to form a group, so it is the only choice compatible with the principle of relativity, i.e. making the stationary aether undetectable. Given this, length contraction and time dilation obtain their exact relativistic values.
