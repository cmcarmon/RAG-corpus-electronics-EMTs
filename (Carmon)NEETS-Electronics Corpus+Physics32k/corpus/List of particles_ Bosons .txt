Bosons are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being fermions. Bosons are characterized by Boseâ€“Einstein statistics and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.
According to the Standard Model the elementary bosons are:

Elementary bosons responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). Strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons, and it is sometimes hypothetized that gravitation is mediated by the graviton, although it is not predicted by the Standard Model but by other theories in the framework of quantum field theory.
The Higgs boson is postulated by the electroweak theory primarily to explain the origin of particle masses. In a process known as the "Higgs mechanism", the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry. The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. A new particle expected to be the Higgs boson was observed at the CERN/LHC on March 14, 2013, around the energy of 126.5 GeV with an accuracy of close to five sigma (99.9999%, which is accepted as definitive). The Higgs mechanism giving mass to other particles has not been observed yet.
