However, because of transistor action, the dynamic resistance from collector to emitter, rce, will be smaller
than rb¢c and will typically be below a megohm. This “transistor action” may be represented by a current source
from collector to emitter that is dependent upon either ib or vb¢e. That is, it will be either hfeib or gmvb¢e . The
latter leads to the well-known hybrid-p model, and it is this which is shown in Fig. 24.31.
