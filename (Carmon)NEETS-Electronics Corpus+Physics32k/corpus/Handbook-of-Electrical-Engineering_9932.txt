It is seen from Fig. 100.30 that the phase-lead compensator increases the high-frequency gain of the open-
loop function relative to its low-frequency gain. Hence, the system has a larger bandwidth, with the advantages
listed above. The pole and zero of the compensator are generally difÔ¨Åcult to place, since the increased gain of
the open-loop function tends to destabilize the system, while the phase lead of the compensator tends to stabilize
the  system.  The  pole-zero  placement  for  the  phase-lead  compensator  is  much  more  critical  than  that  of  the
phase-lag compensator.
