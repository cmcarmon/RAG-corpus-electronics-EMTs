A typical f T*(t) is shown in Fig. 110.4. The time scale is divided into equal intervals of TM each. The function
in each segment is a scaled-down version of the one in the previous segment, the scaling factor being equal to
R(TM).  Irrespective  of  the  nature  of  the  original  failure  density  function,  scheduled  maintenance  gives  it  an
exponential tendency. This is another justiÔ¨Åcation for the widespread use of exponential distribution in system
reliability evaluations.
