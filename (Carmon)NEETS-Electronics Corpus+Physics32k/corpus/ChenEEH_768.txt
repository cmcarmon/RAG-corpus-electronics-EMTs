consumption of data-dominated multimedia applications.
The main objective of these strategies is to reuse memory as
much as possible by obtaining an optimal storage order for
each of the arrays present in a program by means of data layout
transformations that we have called ‘‘inplace data mapping.’’
We assume that the arrays are already assigned to memories in
the preceding MAA step of Section 2.6.
