By now you should be well aware of the correlation between electrical conductivity and cer-
tain types of materials. Those materials allowing for easy passage of free electrons are called
conductors, while those materials impeding the passage of free electrons are called insulators.
Unfortunately, the scientiﬁc theories explaining why certain materials conduct and others
don’t are quite complex, rooted in quantum mechanical explanations in how electrons are ar-
ranged around the nuclei of atoms. Contrary to the well-known ”planetary” model of electrons
whirling around an atom’s nucleus as well-deﬁned chunks of matter in circular or elliptical
orbits, electrons in ”orbit” don’t really act like pieces of matter at all. Rather, they exhibit
the characteristics of both particle and wave, their behavior constrained by placement within
distinct zones around the nucleus referred to as ”shells” and ”subshells.” Electrons can occupy
