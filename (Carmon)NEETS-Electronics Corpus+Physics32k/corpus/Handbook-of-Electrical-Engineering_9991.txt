For a stable case, it is possible to use the gain and phase margin to judge the relative stability of the system.
However,  a  gain  and  phase  margin  can  be  found  for  every  amplitude  a on  the  C(a)  locus,  so  it  is  usually
appropriate to use the minimum values of the quantities [Atherton, 1982]. When the nonlinear block includes
dynamics so that its response is both amplitude and frequency dependent, that is N(a, w), then a limit cycle
will exist if
