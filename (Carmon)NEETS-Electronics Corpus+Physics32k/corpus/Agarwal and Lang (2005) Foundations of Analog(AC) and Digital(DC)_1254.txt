respectively, with the latter being the element law for a linear time-invariant
inductor. This text will focus primarily on linear time-invariant inductors.
Nonetheless, many interesting transducers such as motors, generators, and
other magnetic sensors and actuators, are appropriately modeled with time-
varying inductors.
