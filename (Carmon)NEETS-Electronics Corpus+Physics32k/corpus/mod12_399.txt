PULSE-POSITION MODULATION (ppm) has the advantage of requiring constant transmitter
power. The amplitude and width of the pulses are kept constant. At the same time, the position of each
pulse, in relation to the position of a recurrent reference pulse, is varied by each instantaneous sampled
value of the modulating wave.
