The Bohr model, introduced in 1913, was an attempt to provide a theoretical basis for the Balmer series. The assumptions of the model are:
The orbiting electrons existed in circular orbits that had discrete quantized energies. That is, not every orbit is possible but only certain specific ones.
The laws of classical mechanics do not apply when electrons make the jump from one allowed orbit to another.
When an electron makes a jump from one orbit to another the energy difference is carried off (or supplied) by a single quantum of light (called a photon) which has an energy equal to the energy difference between the two orbitals.
The allowed orbits depend on quantized (discrete) values of orbital angular momentum, L according to the equation




L

=
n
ℏ


{\displaystyle {L}=n\hbar }

Where n = 1,2,3,… and is called the principal quantum number.
