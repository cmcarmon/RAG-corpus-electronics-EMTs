Until 2017, daylight saving time (DST; Portuguese: horário de verão) started on the third Sunday of October and ended on the third Sunday of February. Beginning in 2018, DST will start on the first Sunday of November, while still ending on the third Sunday of February. Therefore, DST will become two or three weeks shorter. On December 15, 2017, President Michel Temer signed a decree instituting the change, because the usual Brazilian election calendar made runoff elections and their vote tallying occur after the switch to DST, causing anomalies and distortions between states with and without DST.
Occasionally, in years when the Carnival celebrations fall on the third Sunday of February, DST's ending is postponed to the following Sunday.
It is observed by Southern, Southeast and Central-Western Brazil (i.e. the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, plus the Federal District). This means that approximately 64% of the Brazilian population live in areas that observe daylight saving time.
During the 2011-12 summer, the Northeastern state of Bahia also observed daylight saving time as an experiment. In the 2012-13 summer, the Northern state of Tocantins observed it, also as a test. Neither state had observed DST since the 2002-03 summer, and did not observe it anymore after these tests.
The clock is moved forward by one hour between the start and end dates, moving Brasília Official Time from UTC-03 to UTC-02; the other states that do not follow summer time observe a change of the offset to Brasília time.
