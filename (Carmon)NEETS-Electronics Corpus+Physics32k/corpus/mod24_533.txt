Insertion loss is composed of the connection coupling loss and additional fiber losses in the fiber
following the connection. In multimode fiber, fiber joints can increase fiber attenuation following the
joint by disturbing the fiber's mode power distribution (MPD). Fiber joints may increase fiber attenuation
because disturbing the MPD may excite radiative modes. Radiative modes are unbound modes that
radiate out of the fiber contributing to joint loss. In single mode fibers, fiber joints can cause the
second-order mode to propagate in the fiber following the joint. As long as the coupling loss of the
connection is small, neither radiative modes (multimode fiber) or the second-order mode (single mode
fiber) are excited.
