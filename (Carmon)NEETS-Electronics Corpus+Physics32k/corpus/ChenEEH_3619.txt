where b0 is the sign bit and where b1b2b3 . . . bb represent the
modulus using a binary code. For digital ﬁltering, the most
widely used binary code is the two’s complement representa-
tion, where for positive numbers b0 ¼ 0 and for negative
numbers b0 ¼ 1. The fractionary part of the number, called
x2 here, is represented as:
