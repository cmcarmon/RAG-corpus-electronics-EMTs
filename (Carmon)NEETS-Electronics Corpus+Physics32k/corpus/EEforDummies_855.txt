DC motors have two wires (or terminals that you solder wires to), one each 
for the positive and negative supply voltage. You run the motor by simply 
supplying a DC voltage that generates the speed that you want, and you 
switch off the voltage when you want the motor to stop. For many DC motors, 
changing the polarity of the supply voltage changes the direction of the axle 
rotation.
