Let (k, l, b)–LNS denote an LNS of integer and fractional
word lengths k and l, respectively, and of base b. These three
parameters determine the properties of the LNS and can be
computed so that the LNS meets certain speciﬁcations. For
example, for a (k, l, b)–LNS to be considered as equivalent to
an n-bit linear ﬁxed-point system, the following two restric-
tions may be posed:
