Technological advances and miniaturization led to integrated
circuits, with the attempt to get complete ﬁlters on a chip. Here
it turned out that using resistors was not convenient, and a new
idea emerged of switched capacitor networks. In these net-
works, the resistors are replaced by rapidly switched capacitors
that act approximately as resistors. In such networks, we have
only capacitors and transistors work as ampliﬁers or switches.
Capacitors and transistors are suitable for integration.
