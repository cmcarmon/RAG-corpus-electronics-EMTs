A Pâ€“N junction photodiode operates on the same 
principles as a photovoltaic cell except that it is used 
to control current flow, not generate it. A reverse-bias 
voltage is applied across the photodiode, forming a 
wide depletion region. When light energy strikes the 
photodiode, it enters the depletion region, creating 
free electrons. The electrons are drawn toward the 
positive side of the bias source. A small current flows 
through the photodiode in the reverse direction. As 
the light energy increases, more free electrons are gen-
erated, creating more current flow.
