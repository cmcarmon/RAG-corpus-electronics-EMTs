If you are not already familiar with storing structures in memory, look at the string (sentence) and ask how
those letters get in memory. To begin with, every typeable symbol and all of the unprintable actions such as
tabbing and carriage returns have been assigned a numerical value from the ASCII code. Each assignment is a
byte-long number. What “This” really looks like (HEX, left to right) is 54 68 69 73. The spaces are HEX 20;
the period 2E. With the alignment null byte at the end, this list of characters forms a proper C string. It is a
structure of 20 bytes. A structure of any number of bytes can be stored, but from the assembly point of view,
