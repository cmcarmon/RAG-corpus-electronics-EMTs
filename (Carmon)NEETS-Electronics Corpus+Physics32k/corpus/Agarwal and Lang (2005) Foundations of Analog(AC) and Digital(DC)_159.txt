While Figure 1.20 is quite simple, it nonetheless makes several important
points. First, the two terminals of the element in Figure 1.20 form a single port
through which the element is addressed. Second, the current i circulates through
that port. That is, the current that enters one terminal is instantaneously equal
to the current that exits the other terminal. Thus, according to the lumped
matter discipline, net charge cannot accumulate within the element. Third, the
voltage v of the element is defined across the port. Thus, the element is assumed
to respond only to the difference of the electrical potentials at its two terminals,
