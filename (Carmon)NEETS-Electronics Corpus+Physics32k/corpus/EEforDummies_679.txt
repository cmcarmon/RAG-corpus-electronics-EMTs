A byte, which youâ€™ve probably heard about quite a bit, is a grouping of eight 
bits used as a basic unit of information for storage in computer systems. 
Computer memory, such as random access memory (RAM), and storage 
devices such as CDs and flash drives, use bytes to organize gobs of data. Just 
as banks pack 40 quarters into a quarter roll, 50 dimes into a dime roll, and 
so forth to simplify the process of supplying merchants with change for their 
cash registers, so computer systems pack data bits together in bytes to sim-
plify the storage of information.
