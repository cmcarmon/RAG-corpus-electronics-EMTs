where  IT is  threshold  current,  QT is  threshold  charge, Io is  the  minimum  threshold  current  for  long-duration
stimuli, Qo is the minimum threshold charge for short-duration stimuli, and t
e is an experimentally determined
strength-duration time constant. It is readily shown that chronaxie = t
