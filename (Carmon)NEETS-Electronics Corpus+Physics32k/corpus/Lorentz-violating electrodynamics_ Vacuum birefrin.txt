Birefringence of light occurs when the solutions to the modified Lorentz-violating Maxwell equations give rise to polarization-dependent speeds. Light propagates as the combination of two orthogonal polarizations that propagate at slightly different phase velocities. A gradual change in the relative phase results as one of the polarizations outpaces the other. The total polarization (the sum of the two) evolves as the light propagates, in contrast to the Lorentz-invariant case where the polarization of light remains fixed when propagating in a vacuum. In the CPT-odd case (d = odd), birefringence causes a simple rotation of the polarization. The CPT-even case (d = even) gives more complicated behavior as linearly polarized light evolves into elliptically polarizations.
The quantity determining the size of the effect is the change in relative phase,
