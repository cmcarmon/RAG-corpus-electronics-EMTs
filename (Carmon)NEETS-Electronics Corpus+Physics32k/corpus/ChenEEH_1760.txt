We divide these requirements into two categories (Wolf et
al., 1997): trafﬁc requirements and functional requirements.
The trafﬁc requirements include limits on real-time param-
eters (e.g., delay and jitter), bandwidth, and reliability; func-
tional requirements include support for multimedia services,
such as multicasting, security, mobility, and session manage-
ment. The trafﬁc requirements can be met only by enhance-
ments to the basic Internet architecture, whereas the functional
requirements can be met by introducing newer protocols over
the TCP/IP networking stack. The functional requirements are
not an absolute necessity in the sense that a distributed multi-
media application can still operate with high performance by
incorporating the necessary functions into the application
itself. They represent, however, the most common functional-
ity required among distributed multimedia applications, and it
would only help to have standardized protocols operating over
the networking protocol stack to satisfy them.
