The free surface should be a sharp boundary separating the two fluids. There should be no flow through this boundary, i.e.,




[
(
v
−

v

b


)
⋅
n

]

f
s


=
0
,


{\displaystyle [(v-v_{b})\cdot n]_{fs}=0,}
or








m
˙




f
s


=
0


{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}_{fs}=0}

where ‘fs’ stands for free surface. This implies that the normal component of the velocity of the fluid at the surface is equal to the normal component of the velocity of the free surface.
