RADIATION PATTERN OF A DIPOLE.â€”The radiation pattern of a dipole (fig. 4-15) is similar 
to that of the doublet (fig. 4-14). Increasing the length of the doublet to 1/2 wavelength has the effect of 
flattening out the radiation pattern. The radiation pattern in the horizontal plane of a dipole is a larger 
circle than that of the doublet. The vertical-radiation pattern lobes are no longer circular. They are 
flattened out and the radiation intensity is greater.
