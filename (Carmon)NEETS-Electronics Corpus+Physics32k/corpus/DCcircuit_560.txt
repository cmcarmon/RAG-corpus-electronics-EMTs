To make the problem simpler, Iâ€™ve omitted resistance values and simply given voltage drops
across each resistor. The two series circuits share a common wire between them (wire 7-8-9-10),
making voltage measurements between the two circuits possible. If we wanted to determine
the voltage between points 4 and 3, we could set up a KVL equation with the voltage between
those points as the unknown:
