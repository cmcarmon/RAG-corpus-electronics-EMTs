Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  the  operation  of  a  555  monostable 
timer circuit. 
 
Simulator 
Breadboard,  5  V  d.c.  power  supply,  555  timer, 
resistors of 10 kG (two required), 220 G, 100 kG,
and  1  MG 5%  0.25  W,  capacitors  of  10  µF  and  
100 µF 16 V, LED, two normally open (NO) push-
button  switches,  stopwatch  or  wristwatch  with 
seconds display. 
 
Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.12 with C =
10  µF  and  R = 100  kG. Connect  the  supply  and 
press  the  ‘stop’  button.  The  LED  should  be  off 
(indicating that the output is at 0 V).  
  Observe  the  time  display  and,  at  a  convenient 
point,  press  the  ‘start’  button.  The  LED  should 
become illuminated after a period of about 1 s (this 
will  probably  be  too  short  an  interval  to  be 
measured accurately). Record the monostable time 
period  (i.e.  the  time  between  pressing  the  ‘start’ 
button and the LED becoming illuminated) in Table 
12.2.  
  Repeat  the  procedure  for  each  of  the  remaining 
C–R values shown in Table 12.2. Note that you can 
interrupt the timing period at any time by pressing 
the ‘stop’ button. 
 
Calculations and graph 
 
Record your results in Table 12.2. For each pair of 
C–R values calculate the product of C (in µF) and R
(in  MG).  Plot  a  graph  showing  corresponding 
values  of  monostable 
time  plotted  against 
corresponding  values  of  C×R using  the  graph 
layout shown in Fig. 12.13. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Comment  on  the  shape  of  the  graph.  Is  this  what 
you would expect? Measure the slope of the graph 
and  use  this  to  confirm  the  relationship  for  the  
monostable  timing  period  quoted  on  page  219.  If 
the graph is not linear can you suggest any reasons 
for this?
