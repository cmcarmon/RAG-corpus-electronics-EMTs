deﬁned as an immediate, thermally induced, total loss of
electronic  function,  must  be  viewed  as  the  primary  and  foremost  aim  of  electronics  thermal  control.  Cata-
strophic  failure  may  result  from  a  signiﬁcant  deterioration  in  the  performance  of  the  component/system  or
from  a  loss  of  structural  integrity  at  one  of  the  relevant  packaging  levels.  In  early  microelectronic  systems,
thermal
catastrophic failure was primarily 
 produced by regenerative heating, and dopant migration, all occurring at elevated transistor junction
runaway
temperatures.  While  these  failure  modes  may  still  occur  during  the  device  development  process,  improved
silicon simulation tools and thermally compensated integrated circuits have largely quieted these concerns and
substantially broadened the operating temperature range of today’s silicon-based logic and memory devices.
Similar  concerns  do  still  exist  in  the  use  of  CMOS  devices  for  high-performance  systems.  Because  of  the
dependence of CMOS circuit speed on temperature, it may be necessary to limit the maximum chip temperature
to achieve a desired cycle time and/or to maintain timing margins in the system.
