If not properly stripped, some of the smaller gauge, thin-wall wire insulation 
can be inadvertently inserted and crimped in the terminal wire barrels. This will 
cause a bad electrical connection. Do not use any connection that is found defective 
as a result of a visual inspection. Cut off the defective connection and remake using 
a new terminal lug.
