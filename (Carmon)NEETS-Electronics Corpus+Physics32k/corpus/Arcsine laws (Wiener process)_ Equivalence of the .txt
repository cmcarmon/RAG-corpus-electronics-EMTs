Defining the running maximum process Mt of the Wiener process





M

t


=
sup
{

W

s



:

s
∈
[
0
,
t
]
}
,


{\displaystyle M_{t}=\sup\{W_{s}\,\colon \,s\in [0,t]\},}

then the law of Xt = Mt − Wt has the same law as a reflected Wiener process |Bt| (where Bt is a Wiener process independent of Wt).
Since the zeros of B and |B| coincide, the last zero of X has the same distribution as L, the last zero of the Wiener process. The last zero of X occurs exactly when W achieves its maximum. It follows that the second and third laws are equivalent.
