4.7(C). Assume5 for the following discussion that a ¼ b ¼ 0
in the circuit in Figure 4.17(B). We observe then that gm1
converts the input voltage Vin into a current that ﬂows through
C1 and the resistor6 1=gm2. In parallel with the capacitor, C1, is
the inductor L ¼ C2=(gm3gm4). The parallel RLC connection of
1=gm2, C1, and L ¼ C2=(gm3gm4) is driven by the current
gm1Vin. The OTA-based grounded inductor can be used in
any ﬁlter application in the same way as the GIC-based in-
ductor of Figure 4.10(A), except that the OTA-based circuit
can be employed at much higher frequencies.
