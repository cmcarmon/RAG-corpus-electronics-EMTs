1An ac power generator consists of (a) a rotor, which produces a magnetic ﬁeld and which is rotated by a prime mover
(say a turbine), and (b) a stator on which are wound one or more coils of wire. In three-phase systems, the number of coils
is three. The rotating magnetic ﬁeld induces a voltage in each of the coils. The 120(cid:176) leading and lagging phase relationships
among these voltages are obtained by distributing the conductors of the coils around the circumference of the stator so that
they are separated geometrically by 120(cid:176). Thus, the three sources described in the text are in reality a single physical device,
a single generator. Similarly, the three loads might be the three windings on a three-phase motor, again a single physical device.
