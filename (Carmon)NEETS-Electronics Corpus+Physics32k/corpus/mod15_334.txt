A simple hand rule will help you determine the direction of the SPIN VECTOR. (See fig. 3-9.) 
Curve the fingers of your fight hand in the direction in which the rotor is turning as if you intended to 
grasp the rotor. Your thumb will point in the direction of the spin vector. Similar rules will give you the 
direction of the TORQUE VECTOR and the PRECESSION VECTOR. With the fingers of your right 
hand wrapped in the direction of the applied torque (die direction the gyro would rotate if the rotor were 
not spinning), your thumb points in the direction of the torque vector. Placing your curved fingers in the 
direction of precession will place your thumb pointing in the direction of the precession vector.
