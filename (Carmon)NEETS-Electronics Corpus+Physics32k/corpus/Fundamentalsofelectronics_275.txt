Creating a speciﬁc transfer function with op-amps does not have a unique answer. As opposed to design
with passive circuits, electronics is more ﬂexible (a cascade of circuits can be built so that each has little
eﬀect on the others; see Problem 3.43) and gain (increase in power and amplitude) can result. To complete
our example, let’s assume we want a lowpass ﬁlter that emulates what the telephone companies do. Signals
transmitted over the telephone have an upper frequency limit of about 3 kHz. For the second design choice,
we require RF C = 5.3 × 10−5. Thus, many choices for resistance and capacitance values are possible. A
1 µF capacitor and a 330 Ω resistor, 10 nF and 33 kΩ, and 10 pF and 33 MΩ would all theoretically work.
Let’s also desire a voltage gain of ten: RF
. Recall that we must have R < Rin.
R
As the op-amp’s input impedance is about 1 MΩ, we don’t want R too large, and this requirement means
that the last choice for resistor/capacitor values won’t work. We also need to ask for less gain than the
op-amp can provide itself. Because the feedback “element” is an impedance (a parallel resistor capacitor
combination), we need to examine the gain requirement more carefully. We must have
< 105 for all
