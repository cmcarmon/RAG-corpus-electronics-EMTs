Second-order circuits are amenable to a quick, intuitive analysis when they are
driven by simple inputs such a step or an impulse, much like first-order circuits
(see Section 10.3). To illustrate, we will show how vC, the voltage across the
capacitor, in the series RLC circuit in Figure 12.55 can be plotted by inspection.
We will assume the following element values:
L = 100 µH
C = 100 µF
R = 0.2 .
