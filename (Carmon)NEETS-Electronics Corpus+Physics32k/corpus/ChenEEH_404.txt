where V2k and I2k are the vectors of the input voltages and
currents, respectively, identiﬁed in Figure 4.10(D) and R is the
resistance matrix describing the network and linking the two
vectors. By equation 4.25, we have from the GICs the relation-
ships V1k ¼ V2k and I2k ¼ sT I1k so that with equation 4.28,
we obtain the result:
