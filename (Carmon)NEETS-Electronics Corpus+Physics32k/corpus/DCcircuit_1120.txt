Unfortunately, mercury cells were rather intolerant of any current drain and could not
even be measured with an analog voltmeter without compromising accuracy. Manufacturers
typically called for no more than 0.1 mA of current through the cell, and even that Ô¨Ågure
was considered a momentary, or surge maximum! Consequently, standard cells could only
be measured with a potentiometric (null-balance) device where current drain is almost zero.
Short-circuiting a mercury cell was prohibited, and once short-circuited, the cell could never
be relied upon again as a standard device.
