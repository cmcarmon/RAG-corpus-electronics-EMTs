Direct Current Power Flow Algorithm
A further simpliﬁcation of the fast decoupled algorithm is the
highly approximate dc power ﬂow algorithm, which com-
pletely transforms the nonlinear power ﬂow equations into
linear equations by using drastic assumptions. In addition to
the assumptions used in deriving the fast decoupled method,
we also assume that all the voltage magnitudes are at 1 pu and
all the transmission lines are lossless.
