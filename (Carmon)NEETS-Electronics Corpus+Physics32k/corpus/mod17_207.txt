sidebands that must be transmitted to obtain the desired fidelity is related to the deviation (change in
carrierâ€™ frequency) divided by the highest audio frequency to be used. At this point you may want to
review chapter 2 of NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles. For example, if the deviation is 40
kilohertz and the highest audio frequency is 10 kilohertz, the modulation index is figured as shown below:
