The Ô¨Åeld of signal detection and estimation is concerned with the processing of information-bearing signals
for  the  purpose  of  extracting  the  information  they  contain.  The  applications  of  this  methodology  are  quite
broad, ranging from areas of electrical engineering such as automatic control, digital communications, image
processing,  and  remote  sensing,  into  other  engineering  disciplines  and  the  physical,  biological,  and  social
sciences.
