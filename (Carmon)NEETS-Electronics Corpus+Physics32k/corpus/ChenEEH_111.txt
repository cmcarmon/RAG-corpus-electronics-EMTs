In deriving the loop system, the loop transformation is used
in place of KCL in this case, the loop variables (chord currents)
serve as independent variables. In deriving the cutset system,
the cutset transformation is used in place of KVL, and the
cutset variables (tree branch voltages) serve as the independent
