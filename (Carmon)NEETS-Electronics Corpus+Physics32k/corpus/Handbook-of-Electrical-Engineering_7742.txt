If SSDs are to be used to replace magnetic disks, then they must be made nonvolatile, and herein lies their
greatest weakness. This can be achieved through battery back-up, but the technique is controversial. First, it is
difﬁcult  to  verify  that  the  batteries  will  be  fully  charged  when  needed,  i.e.,  when  conventional  power  fails.
Second, it is difﬁcult to determine how long is long enough when powering the SSD with batteries. This should
probably  be  long  enough  to  off-load  the  disk’s  contents  to  magnetic  media.  Fortunately,  low-power  DRAM
and wafer scale integration technology are making feasible longer battery hold times.
