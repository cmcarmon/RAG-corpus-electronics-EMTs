In the case fluid is not pure, i.e. is a mixture of substances (technically contains a number of component substances), the mass fluxes must be considered separately for each component of the mixture.
When describing fluid flow (i.e. flow of matter), mass flux is appropriate. When describing particle transport (movement of a large number of particles), it is useful to use an analogous quantity, called the molar flux.
Using mass, the mass flux of component i is:

i


=

u


i




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {j} }_{{\rm {m}},\,i}=\rho _{i}\mathbf {u} _{i}}

The barycentric mass flux of component i is

)



{\displaystyle {\mathbf {j} }_{{\rm {m}},\,i}=\rho \left(\mathbf {u} _{i}-\langle \mathbf {u} \rangle \right)}

where



⟨

u

⟩


{\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {u} \rangle }
is the average mass velocity of all the components in the mixture, given by:

{\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {u} \rangle ={\frac {1}{\rho }}\sum _{i}\rho _{i}\mathbf {u} _{i}={\frac {1}{\rho }}\sum _{i}\mathbf {j} _{{\rm {m}},\,i}}

where :
ρ = mass density of the entire mixture,
ρi = mass density of component i,
u i = velocity of component i.
The average is taken over the velocities of the components.
