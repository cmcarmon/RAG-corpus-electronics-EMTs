Thévenin’s theorem: At a pair of terminals a linear electrical network can be replaced with a voltage source
in series with an impedance. The voltage source is equal to the voltage at the terminals when the terminals
are  open-circuited.  The  impedance  is  equal  to  the  impedance  at  the  terminals  with  all  independent
sources set equal to zero.
