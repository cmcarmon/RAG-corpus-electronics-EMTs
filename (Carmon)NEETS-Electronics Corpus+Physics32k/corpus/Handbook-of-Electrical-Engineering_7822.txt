Thus for a wavelength of l = 700 nm and NA = 0.6, the depth of focus is about –1 mm. As the disk spins
under the optical head at the rate of several thousand rpm, the objective lens must stay within a distance of
f  – d from the active layer if proper focus is to be maintained. Given the conditions under which drives usually
operate, it is impossible to make rigid enough mechanical systems to yield the required positioning tolerances.
On the other hand, it is fairly simple to mount the objective lens in an actuator capable of adjusting its position
with the aid of closed-loop feedback control. We shall discuss the technique of automatic focusing in the next
section. For now, let us emphasize that by going to shorter wavelengths and/or larger numerical apertures (as
is required for attaining higher data densities) one will have to face a much stricter regime as far as automatic
focusing  is  concerned.  Increasing  the  numerical  aperture  is  particularly  worrisome,  since  d  drops  with  the
square of NA.
