It can also be shown that equation 9.33 reduces to equation
9.34 if the Courant factor S and the wave-propagation direc-
tion are suitably chosen. For example, reduction to the ideal
dispersion case can be demonstrated for a numerical plane

wave propagating along a diagonal of a three-dimensional
cubic lattice (~kkx ¼ ~kky ¼ ~kkz ¼ ~kk=

. Similarly,
ideal dispersion results for a numerical plane wave propa-

ideal dispersion
results for any numerical wave in a one-dimensional grid if
S ¼ 1. These reductions to the ideal case have little practical
value for two- and three-dimensional simulations, occurring
only for diagonal propagation. However, the reduction to
ideal dispersion in one dimension is very interesting, since it
implies that the Yee algorithm (based on numerical ﬁnite-
difference approximations) yields an exact solution for wave
propagation.
