To run a program, you type its name and arguments into the
shell. The shell then forks off a child, passes the arguments to
the child, and keeps quiet until the child has Ô¨Ånished executing
and exists. It is not possible to put an ampersand (&) at the
end of the command line to start the command off in the
background.
