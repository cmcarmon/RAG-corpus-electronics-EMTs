Of the different Markov models available, the discrete-state continuous-time Markov process has found many
applications in system reliability evaluation, including the modeling of repairable systems. The model consists
of  a  set  of  discrete  states,  called  the  state  space,  in  which  the  system  can  reside  and  a  set  of  transition  rates
between appropriate states. Using these, a set of Ô¨Årst order differential equations are derived in the standard
vector-matrix  form  for  the  time-dependent  probabilities  of  the  various  states.  Solution  of  these  equations
incorporating  proper  initial  conditions  gives  the  probabilities  of  the  system  residing  in  different  states  as
functions of time. Several useful results can be gleaned from these functions.
