A TTL NAND gate is very similar to the inverter circuit, with the exception that the input coupling transistor
Q1 is constructed with multiple emitter-base junctions and each input to the NAND is connected to a separate
emitter terminal. Any of the transistorâ€™s multiple emitters can be used to turn on Q1. The TTL NAND gate
thus functions in the same manner as the inverter in that if any of the NAND gate inputs are low, the same
circuit action will take place as with a low input to the inverter. Therefore, any time a low input is applied to
the NAND gate it will produce a high ouput. Only if all of the NAND gate inputs are simultaneously high will
it then produce the same circuit action as the inverter with its single input high, and the resultant output will
be low. Input coupling transistors with up to eight emitter-base junctions, and therefore, eight input NAND
gates, are constructed.
