A  signal  typical  for  some  PEMF  (A,  C,  D)  devices  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 113.32.  Part  A  shows  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  versus  time  and  Part  B  the
corresponding electric ﬁeld induced into a linear, isotropic medium. The
waveform  shown  on  Part  B  can  be  measured  by  a  probe  coil  having  a
sufﬁciently large number of turns. The frequency spectrum of the electric
ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 113.33. Signals used by the different manufacturers
are protected by patents, and FDA approval is for particular signal param-
eters within speciﬁed tolerances on time and amplitude. The pseudoarthro-
sis signal used by Electrobiology, Inc. (EBI) (B in Table 113.2) consists of
single  pulses  repeated  at  a  rate  of  72  pps  rather  than  the  pulse  bursts
illustrated in Figs. 113.32 and 113.33. Each magnetic ﬁeld pulse increases
from zero to 3.5 mT in 380 ms and then decreases slowly to zero in approx-
imately 4.5 ms. The signals that are now in use have evolved considerably
from those employed in the initial studies, and some have little resemblance
to the endogenous electrical signals elicited by mechanical stress.
