Stability Theorem: The closed-loop system consisting of the
negative feedback interconnection of Gp(s) and Gc(s) is inter-
nally stable if and only if nLoþ ¼ nGpþ þ nGcþ and the Nyquist
plot of jI þ Lo(s)j encircles the origin nLoþ times in the anti-
clockwise direction and does not pass through the origin.
