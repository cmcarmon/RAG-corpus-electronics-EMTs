Torsional vibration can be introduced into a drive train by the power source. But even a drive train with a very smooth rotational input can develop torsional vibrations through internal components. Common sources are:
Internal combustion engine: The torsional vibrations of the not continuous combustion and the crank shaft geometry itself cause torsional vibrations
Reciprocating compressor: The pistons experience discontinuous forces from the compression.
Universal joint: The geometry of this joint causes torsional vibrations if the shafts are not parallel.
Stick slip: During the engagement of a friction element, stick slip situations create torsional vibrations.
Lash: Lash in a drive train can cause torsional vibrations if the direction of rotation is changed.
