The parameters of the equivalent circuit shown in Figure 13.2.6 for a three-phase, wye-connected,
220-V, 10-hp, 60-Hz, six-pole induction motor are given in ohms per phase referred to the stator:
= 0.2, and Xm = 15. The total friction, windage, and core
R1 = 0.3, R
losses can be assumed to be constant at 400 W, independent of load. For a per-unit slip of 0.02,
when the motor is operated at rated voltage and frequency, calculate the stator input current, the
power factor at the stator terminals, the rotor speed, output power, output torque, and efÔ¨Åciency.
