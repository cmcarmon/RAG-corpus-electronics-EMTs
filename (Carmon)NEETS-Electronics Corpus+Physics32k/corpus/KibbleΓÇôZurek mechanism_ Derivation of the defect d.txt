Let us consider a system that undergoes a continuous phase transition at the critical value

of a control parameter. The theory of critical phenomena states that, as the control parameter is tuned closer and closer to its critical value, the correlation length and the relaxation time of the system tend to diverge as  respectively. If the control parameter varies linearly in time,

{\displaystyle \lambda (t)=vt}
, equating the time to the critical point to the relaxation time, we obtain the freeze out time
