Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) Control
It can be shown that the Kalman ﬁlter is the optimal estimator for the state of system Eq. (100.156) or (100.164)
in the sense that it minimizes the squared error due to the noise input terms. Therefore, it becomes a likely candidate
for  combination  with  the  LQR  of  the  previous  section.  Together,  the  combination  of  LQR  and  Kalman  ﬁlter  is
known  as  the  LQG  (linear-quadratic-Gaussian)  controller,  and  is  a  useful  controller  in  many  situations.  This
controller is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the expected root-mean-square value of the optimization criterion
