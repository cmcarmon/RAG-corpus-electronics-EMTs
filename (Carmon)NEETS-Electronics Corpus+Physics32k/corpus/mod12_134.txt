A MICROPHONE is an energy converter that changes sound energy into electrical energy. A 
diaphragm in the microphone moves in and out in accordance with the compression and rarefaction of the 
atmosphere caused by sound waves. The diaphragm is connected to a device that causes current flow in 
proportion to the instantaneous pressure delivered to it. Many devices can perform this function. The 
particular device used in a given application depends on the characteristics desired, such as sensitivity, 
frequency response, impedance matching, power requirements, and ruggedness.
