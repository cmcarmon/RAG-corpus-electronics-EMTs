The D FF is a two-input FF. The inputs are the data (D) input and a clock (CLK) input. The clock is
a timing pulse generated by the equipment to control operations. The D FF is used to store data at a
predetermined time and hold it until it is needed. This circuit is sometimes called a delay FF. In other
words, the data input is delayed up to one clock pulse before it is seen in the output.
