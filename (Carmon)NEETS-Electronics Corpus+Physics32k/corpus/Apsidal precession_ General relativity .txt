An apsidal precession of the planet Mercury was noted by Urbain Le Verrier in the mid-19th century and accounted for by Einstein's general theory of relativity.
Einstein showed that for a planet, the major semi-axis of its orbit being

{\displaystyle \alpha }

where c is the speed of light. In the case of Mercury, half of the greater axis is circa 5.79×1010 m, the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.206 and the period of revolution 87.97 days or 7.6×106 s. From these and the speed of light (which is ~3×108 m/s), it can be calculated that the apsidial precession during one period of revolution is

{\displaystyle \epsilon }
= 5.028×10−7 radians (2.88×10−5 degrees or 0.104 arcseconds). In one hundred years, Mercury makes approximately 415 revolutions around the Sun, and thus in that time, the apsidal perihelion due to relativistic effects is approximately 43 arcseconds, which corresponds almost exactly to the previously unexplained part of the measured value.
