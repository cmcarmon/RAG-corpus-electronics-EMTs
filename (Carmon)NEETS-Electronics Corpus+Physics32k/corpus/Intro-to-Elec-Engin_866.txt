10.2.5 A three-phase power system consists of a wye-
connected ideal generator, supplying a wye-con-
nected balanced load through a three-phase
¯ZL = 20(cid:2) 30°/
feeder. The load has
phase, and the feeder has an impedance ¯Zfdr =
1.5(cid:2) 75° /phase. If the terminal voltage of the
load is 4.16 kV, determine:
(a) The terminal voltage of the generator.
(b) The line current supplied by the generator.
