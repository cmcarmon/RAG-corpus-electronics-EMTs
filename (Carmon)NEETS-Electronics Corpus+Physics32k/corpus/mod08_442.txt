Another approach to solving the problem of load flux affecting control flux is shown in figure 3-37.
Figure 3-37 shows a toroidal saturable-core reactor. The shape of these cores is a toroid (donut shape).
The windings are wound around the cores so that the load flux aids the control flux in one core and
opposes the control flux in the other core.
