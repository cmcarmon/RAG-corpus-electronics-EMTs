The Transformed Circuit
Instead of writing the describing circuit equations, transforming the results, and solving for the transform of
the circuit current or voltage, we may go directly to a transformed circuit, which is the original circuit with
the currents, voltages, sources, and passive elements replaced by transformed equivalents. The current or voltage
transforms are then found using ordinary circuit theory and the results inverted to the time-domain answers.
