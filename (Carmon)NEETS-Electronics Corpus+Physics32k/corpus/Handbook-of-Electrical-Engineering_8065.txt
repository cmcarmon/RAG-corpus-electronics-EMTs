Perhaps more important are the safety hazards that may be engendered by replacing analog control systems
with digital control systems. Most analog systems are based on physical properties with continuous behavior.
Digital systems, on the other hand, are discrete and are thus much more prone to problems where small errors
can result in large changes in behavior due to the digital representation of value; a single bit change can result
in  a  large  change  in  magnitude.  Digital  control  systems  are  becoming  more  and  more  prevalent  in  systems
controlling aircraft, automobiles, nuclear power plants, and other safety-critical systems. Engineers who design
