Common Emitter Ampliﬁer
The most commonly used canonic cell of linear BJT ampliﬁers is the common emitter ampliﬁer, whose basic
circuit  schematic  diagram  is  depicted  in  Fig.  28.14(a).  In  this  diagram,  RST  is  the  Thévenin  resistance  of  the
applied  signal  source, VST,  and  RLT  is  the  effective,  or  Thévenin,  load  resistance  driven  by  the  ampliﬁer.  The
signal source has zero average, or dc, value. Although requisite biasing is not shown in the ﬁgure, it is tacitly
assumed that the transistor is biased for linear operation. Hence, the diagram at hand is actually the ac schematic
diagram; that is, it delineates only the signal paths of the circuit. Note that in the common emitter orientation,
the input signal is applied to the base of the transistor, while the resultant small signal voltage response, VOS,
is extracted at the transistor collector.
