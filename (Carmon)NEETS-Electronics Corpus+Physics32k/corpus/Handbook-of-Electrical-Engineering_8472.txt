Addition and Subtraction in Sign and Magnitude System
In the SM number system addition/subtraction is performed on pairs (us, um) and (ws, wm) resulting in a sum
(ss, sm), where us and ws are sign bits and um and wm are magnitudes. The algorithm is relatively complex because
it  requires  comparisons  of  the  signs  and  magnitudes  as  well.  Extending  the  addition  algorithm  in  order  to
perform subtraction is relatively easy because it only involves change of the sign of the operand being subtracted.
Therefore, we will consider only the addition algorithm.
