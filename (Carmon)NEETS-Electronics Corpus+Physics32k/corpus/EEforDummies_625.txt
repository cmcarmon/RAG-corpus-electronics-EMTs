▶✓ Transistor amplifier: If you want to use the transistor as an amplifier 
(active mode), you select supply voltages and resistors to connect to 
the transistor so that you forward‐bias the base‐emitter junction and 
allow just enough base current to flow — but not so much that the tran-
sistor becomes saturated. This selection process is known as biasing the 
transistor.
