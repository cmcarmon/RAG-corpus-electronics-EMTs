Telescopes and radars, in terms of locating objects in space, have many common problems. Both 
have a limited field of view and both require a geographic reference system to describe the position of an 
object (target). The position of an object viewed with a telescope is usually described by relating it to a 
familiar object with a known position. Radar uses a standard system of reference coordinates to describe 
the position of an object in relation to the position of the radar. Normally ANGULAR measurements are 
made from true north in an imaginary flat plane called the HORIZONTAL PLANE. All angles in the UP 
direction are measured in a second imaginary plane perpendicular to the horizontal plane called the 
VERTICAL PLANE. The center of the coordinate system is the radar location. As shown in figure 3-1, 
the target position with respect to the radar is defined as 60 degrees true, 10 degrees up, and 10 miles 
distant. The line directly from the radar to the target is called the LINE OF SIGHT. The distance from 
point 1 to point 2, measured along the line of sight, is called TARGET RANGE. The angle between the 
horizontal plane and the line of sight is known as the ELEVATION ANGLE. The angle measured in a 
clockwise direction in the horizontal plane between true north and the line of sight is known as 
BEARING (sometimes referred to as AZIMUTH). These three coordinates of range, bearing, and 
elevation determine the location of the target with respect to the radar.
