A flow is termed critical if the bulk velocity of the flow



V


{\displaystyle V}
is equal to the propagation velocity of a shallow gravity wave

. At critical flow, the specific energy and the specific momentum (force) are at a minimum for a given discharge. Figure 4 shows this relationship by showing a specific energy curve (E-y diagram) side-by-side to its corresponding specific momentum curve (M-y diagram) for a unit discharge q = 10 ft2/s. The green line on these figures intersects the curves at the minimum x-axis value that each curve exhibits. As noted, both of these intersections occur at a depth of approximately 1.46 ft, which is the critical flow depth for the specific conditions in the given channel. This critical depth represents the transition depth in the channel where the flow switches from supercritical flow to subcritical flow or vice versa.

In a rectangular channel, critical depth (yc) can also be found mathematically using the following equation:

Where:
g = gravitational constant (L/t2)
q = unit flowrate or discharge â€“ for a rectangular channel, discharge per unit channel width (L2/t)
