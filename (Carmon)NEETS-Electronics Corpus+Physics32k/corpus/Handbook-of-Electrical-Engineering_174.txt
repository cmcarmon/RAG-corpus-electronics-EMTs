Selective Coordination
In  any  power  distribution  system,  selective  coordination  exists  when  the  fuse  immediately  upstream  from  a
fault operates, leaving all other fuses further upstream unaffected. This increases system reliability by isolating
the faulted branch while maintaining power to all other branches. Selective coordination is easily assessed by
