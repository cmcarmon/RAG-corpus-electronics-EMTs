Steam Turbine Governing is the procedure of monitoring and controlling the flow rate of steam into the turbine with the objective of maintaining its speed of rotation as constant. The flow rate of steam is monitored and controlled by interposing valves between the boiler and the turbine. Depending upon the particular method adopted for control of steam flow rate, different types of governing methods are being practiced. The principal methods used for governing are described below.
==Thrott In throttle governing now the pressure of steam is reduced at the turbine entry thereby decreasing the availability of energy. In this method steam is passed through a restricted passage thereby reducing its pressure across the governing valve. The flow rate is controlled using a partially opened steam control valve. The reduction in pressure leads to a throttling process in which the enthalpy of steam remains constant.
