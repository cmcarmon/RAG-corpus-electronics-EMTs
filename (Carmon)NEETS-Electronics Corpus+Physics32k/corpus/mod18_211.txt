The synchronizer is often referred to as the "heart" of the radar system because it controls and
provides timing for the operation of the entire system. Other names for the synchronizer are the TIMER
and the KEYER. We will use the term synchronizer in our discussion. In some complex systems the
synchronizer is part of a system computer that performs many functions other than system timing.
