State-of-the-Art Recognition Systems
Dictation-oriented recognizers which accommodate isolated word vocabularies of many thousands of words
in speaker-adaptive manner are currently available commercially. So too are speaker-independent, continuous
speech recognizers for small vocabularies, such as the digits; similar products for larger (1000-word) vocabu-
laries with constrained grammars are imminent. Speech recognition research is aimed, in part, at the develop-
ment of more robust pattern classiÔ¨Åcation techniques, including some based on neural networks [Lippmann,
1989] and on the development of systems which accommodate more natural spoken language dialogs between
human and machine.
