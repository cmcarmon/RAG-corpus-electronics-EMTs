Voltage and ground lines must be properly sized to prevent the peak current density exceeding the level at
which the power lines will be physically “blown out,” leading to rapid and catastrophic failure of the circuit.
An equally serious problem is gradual deterioration of a voltage or ground line, eventually leading to failure
as a result of electromigration. Electromigration failure affects both signal and power lines, but is particularly
important in power lines because of the constant direction of the current. As current ﬂows through an aluminum
interconnection,  the  average  force  exerted  on  the  metal  atoms  by  the  electrons  leads  to  a  slow  migration  of
those  atoms  in  the  direction  of  electron  ﬂow,  causing  the  line  to  migrate  in  the  direction  of  the  electrons
(opposite to the current ﬂow). In regions of the metal line where discontinuities occur (e.g., at the naturally
occurring grain boundaries), a void can develop, creating an open in the line. Fortunately, there is a current
density  threshold  level  (about  1 mA/mm)  below  which  electromigration  is  insigniﬁcant.  Notably,  copper,  in
addition  to  having  a  lower  resistivity  than  aluminum,  has  greater  resistance  to  electromigration.  Accurate
estimates of power dissipation due to logic switching within logic blocks of the ASIC are also necessary to assess
thermal heating within the IC.
