of the circuit, as discussed
We are familiar with the natural response 
in  Section  7.2. 
is  known  as  the  forced response  because  it  is  pro-
duced by the circuit when an external “force’’ (a voltage source in this
case)  is  applied.  It  represents  what  the  circuit  is  forced  to  do  by  the
input  excitation.  The  natural  response  eventually  dies  out  along  with
the transient component of the forced response, leaving only the steady-
state component of the forced response.
