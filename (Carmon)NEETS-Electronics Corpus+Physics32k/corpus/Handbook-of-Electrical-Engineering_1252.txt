In this expression, mean [dk] designates the arithmetic mean of vector dk whose components correspond to
the elements of matrix A along its kth diagonal. In particular, vector do has as its components the elements of
the  main  diagonal  [i.e,  elements  A(1,1),  A(2,2),  etc.],  vector  d1  has  as  its  components  the  elements  of  the
diagonal immediately below the main diagonal, vector dâ€“1 has as its components the elements of the diagonal
immediately above the main diagonal, and so forth. The projection operator PT that maps A into AT as governed
by relationship (14.119) is designated by
