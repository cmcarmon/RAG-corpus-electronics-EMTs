When the armature is in its resting position (midway between the two poles), the magnetic flux is 
established across the air gap. However, no resultant flux is established in the armature. When a 
compression wave strikes the diaphragm, the armature is deflected to the right. Most of the flux continues 
to move in the direction of the arrows. However, some flux now flows from the north pole of the magnet 
across the reduced gap at the upper right, down through the armature, and around to the south pole of the 
magnet.
