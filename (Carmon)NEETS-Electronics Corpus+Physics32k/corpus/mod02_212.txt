A MICA CAPACITOR is made of metal foil plates that are separated by sheets of mica (the dielectric).
The whole assembly is encased in molded plastic. Figure 3-16(A) shows a cut-away view of a mica
capacitor. Because the capacitor parts are molded into a plastic case, corrosion and damage to the plates and
dielectric are prevented. In addition, the molded plastic case makes the capacitor mechanically stronger.
Various types of terminals are used on mica capacitors to connect them into circuits. These terminals are
also molded into the plastic case.
