Since most CDMA detectors are correlation receivers, it is important when deploying such a system to have
a set of spreading sequences that have relatively low-pairwise cross-correlation between any two sequences in
the set. Further, there are two fundamental types of operation in CDMA, synchronous and asynchronous. In
the former case, the symbol transition times of all of the users are aligned; this allows for orthogonal sequences
to be used as the spreading sequences and, thus, eliminates interference from one user to another. Alternatively,
if no effort is made to align the sequences, the system operates asynchronously; in this latter mode, multiple
access interference limits the ultimate channel capacity, but the system design exhibits much more ï¬‚exibility.
CDMA has been of particular interest recently for applications in wireless communications. These applica-
tions include cellular communications, personal communications services (PCS), and wireless local area net-
works.  The  reason  for  this  popularity  is  primarily  due  to  the  performance  that  spread  spectrum  waveforms
display when transmitted over a multipath fading channel.
