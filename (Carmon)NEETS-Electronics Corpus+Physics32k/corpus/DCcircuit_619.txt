Fundamentally, what we’re doing here with a qualitative usage of Ohm’s Law and the rules
of series and parallel circuits is no different from what we’ve done before with numerical ﬁg-
ures. In fact, its a lot easier because you don’t have to worry about making an arithmetic or
calculator keystroke error in a calculation. Instead, you’re just focusing on the principles be-
hind the equations. From our table above, we can see that Ohm’s Law should be applicable to
the R1//R2 and R3//R4 columns. For R3//R4, we ﬁgure what happens to the voltage, given an
increase in current and no change in resistance. Intuitively, we can see that this must result
in an increase in voltage across the parallel combination of R3//R4:
