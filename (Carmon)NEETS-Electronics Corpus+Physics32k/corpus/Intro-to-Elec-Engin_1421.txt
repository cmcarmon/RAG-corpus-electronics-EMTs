Both conical-horn and pyramidal-horn (aperture-type) antennas are mainly used as illumi-
nators for large-aperture paraboloidal antennas, which are capable of generating very narrow
beamwidth patterns (with even less than 1° in angle-tracking radars). When a parabola is rotated
about the z-axis [see Figure 15.1.17(g)], a surface of revolution known as a paraboloid results.
With the source at the focus called the feed, the radiation pattern is mainly a dominant lobe in
the z-direction with smaller side lobes. Paraboloidal antennas have found wide use as antennas
for radar and communications. The Cassegrain antenna [shown in section in Figure 15.1.17(h)]
is a variation of the paraboloid that gives improved system performance. The feed in this case
is moved to the rear of the antenna, and it illuminates a conducting surface (subreﬂector in the
shape of a hyperboloid) placed near the focus.
