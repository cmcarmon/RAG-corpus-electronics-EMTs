to disconnect at least two transistor leads from the associated circuit for this test. Exercise caution during
this test to make certain that current during the forward resistance tests does not exceed the rating of the
transistor — ohmmeter ranges requiring a current of more than 1 milliampere should not be used for
testing transistors. Many ohmmeters are designed such that on the R ·  1 range, 100 milliamperes or more
can flow through the electronic part under test. For this reason, you should use a digital multimeter. Be
sure you select a digital multimeter that produces enough voltage to properly bias the transistor junctions.
