The TGA instrument continuously weighs a sample as it is heated to temperatures of up to 2000 Â°C for coupling with FTIR and Mass spectrometry gas analysis. As the temperature increases, various components of the sample are decomposed and the weight percentage of each resulting mass change can be measured.
Thermogravimetric analysis is often combined with other process or used in conjunction with other analytical methods. For example a TGA is sometimes attached in line with a mass spectrometer.
