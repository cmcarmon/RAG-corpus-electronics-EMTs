Two journals, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology and IEEE Micro â€” provide up-
to-date information on developments in video processing. A number of conferences cover this area, including
the International Solid State Circuits Conference (ISCCC) and the Silicon Signal Processing (SiSP) Workshop.
