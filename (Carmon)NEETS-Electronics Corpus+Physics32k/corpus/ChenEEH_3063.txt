ﬂux density in tesla, E as the rms-induced voltage, f as the
frequency in hertz, and N as the numbers of turns in the
winding. With no load on the secondary circuit, a small excit-
ing current ﬂows in the primary, which produces the alternat-
ing ﬂux in the core. This ﬂux links both windings and induces
essentially the same volts per turn in each winding. To a close
approximation:
