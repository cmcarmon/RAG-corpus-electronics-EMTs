Fortunately, there exist better approaches to the organization of circuit
analysis, and these approaches are the subject of this chapter. In this chap-
ter, we develop a number of network theorems, all based on the fundamental
methods of Chapter 2, which greatly simplify circuit analysis, and provide
substantial insight about how circuits behave. These theorems also provide
us with additional circuit vocabulary and a little more abstraction.
