The control of the refractive index proﬁle along the cross section of the deposited portion of the preform is
achieved through a vapor delivery system. In this system, liquids are vaporized by passing a carrier gas (pure
O2 ) through the bubblers, made of fused silica. Accurate ﬂows are achieved with precision ﬂow controllers that
maintain accurate carrier gas ﬂows and extremely accurate temperatures within the bubblers. Microprocessors
are  used  to  automate  the  complete  deposition  process,  including  the  torch  travel  and  composition  changes
throughout the process. Impurities are reduced to very low levels by starting with pure chemicals, and there is
further  reducing  of  the  impurities  with  in-house  puriﬁcation  of  these  chemicals.  Ultra-pure  oxygen  and  a
completely sealed vapor-delivery system are used to avoid chemical contamination. Transition-metal ion impu-
rities of well below 1 ppb and OH– ion impurities of less than 1 ppm are typically maintained to produce high-
quality ﬁber.
