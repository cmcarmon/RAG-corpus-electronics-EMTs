carries glass fragments of the envelope with it. Once these fragments reach the center of the tube, they
continue outward with considerable velocity. The result is similar to an explosion, in that the immediate
area surrounding the electron tube is filled with fast-moving glass fragments. You, as a nearby object,
may find yourself the target for many of these glass fragments. For this reason you should handle all
electron tubes with care.
