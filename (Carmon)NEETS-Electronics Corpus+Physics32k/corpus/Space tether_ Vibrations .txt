Computer models frequently show tethers can snap due to vibration.
Mechanical tether-handling equipment is often surprisingly heavy, with complex controls to damp vibrations. The one ton climber proposed by Dr. Brad Edwards for his Space Elevator may detect and suppress most vibrations by changing speed and direction. The climber can also repair or augment a tether by spinning more strands.
The vibration modes that may be a problem include skipping rope, transverse, longitudinal, and pendulum.
Tethers are nearly always tapered, and this can greatly amplify the movement at the thinnest tip in whip-like ways.
