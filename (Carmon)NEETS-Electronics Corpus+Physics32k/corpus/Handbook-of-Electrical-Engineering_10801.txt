The study of industrial ecology will, in the long run, provide the means by which the human species can
deliberately and rationally approach a desirable long-term global carrying capacity. Oversimplifying, it can be
thought of as “the science of sustainability”. The approach is “deliberate” and “rational”, to differentiate it from
other, unplanned paths that might result, for example, in global pandemics, or economic and cultural collapse.
The endpoint is “desirable”, to differentiate it from other conceivable states such as a Malthusian subsistence
world, which could involve much lower population levels, or oscillating population levels that depend on death
rates  to  maintain  a  balance  between  resources  and  population  levels.  Figure 111.1  illustrates  how  industrial
ecology provides a framework for operationalizing the vision of sustainable development.
