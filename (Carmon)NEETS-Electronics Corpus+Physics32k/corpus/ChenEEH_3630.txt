Another implementation alternative is to employ program-
mable logic devices (PLD) that include a large number of logic
functions on a single chip. An advanced version of PLD is the
ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA). An FPGA is an array of
logic macro-cells that are interconnected through a number of
communication channels conﬁgured in horizontal and vertical
directions. The FPGAs allow the system designer to conﬁgure
very complex digital logic that can implement digital signal
processing tasks at low cost with reduced power consumption.
Usually, high-level software tools are available for the design of
digital systems using FPGAs.
