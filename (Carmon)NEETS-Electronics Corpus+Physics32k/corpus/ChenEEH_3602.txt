There are three basic approximation methods for FIR ﬁlters
satisfying given speciﬁcations. The ﬁrst one, the window
method, is very simple and well established but generally
leads to transfer functions that normally have a higher order
than those obtained by optimization methods. The second
method, known as minimax method, calculates a transfer
function that has minimum order to satisfy prescribed speciﬁ-
cations. The minimax method is an iterative method and is
available in most ﬁlter design packages. The third method,
known as weighted least squares-Chebyshev3 (WLS-Cheby-
shev) is a reliable but not widely known method. The WLS-
Chebyshev method is particularly suitable for multirate
systems because the resulting transfer functions might have
decreasing energy at a prescribed range of frequencies.
