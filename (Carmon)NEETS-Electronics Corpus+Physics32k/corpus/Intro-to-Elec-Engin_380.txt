4.2.15 (a) A balanced wye-connected load with per-
phase impedance of 20+j10  is connected to
a balanced 415-V, three-phase supply through
three conductors, each of which has a series
impedance of 2+ j4 . Find the line current,
the voltage across the load, the power deliv-
ered to the load, and the power lost in the line
conductors.
