The motion is singular if at some point, the swinging mass passes through the origin. Since the system is invariant under time reversal and translation, it is equivalent to say that the pendulum starts at the origin and is fired outwards:




r
(
0
)
=
0


{\displaystyle r(0)=0}

The region close to the pivot is singular, since



r


{\displaystyle r}
is close to zero and the equations of motion require dividing by



r


{\displaystyle r}
. As such, special techniques must be used to rigorously analyze these cases.
The following are plots of arbitrarily selected singular orbits.
