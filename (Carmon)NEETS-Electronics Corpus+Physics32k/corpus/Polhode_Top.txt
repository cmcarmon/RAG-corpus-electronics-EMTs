The details of a spinning body may impose restrictions on the motion of its angular velocity vector, Ï‰. The curve produced by the angular velocity vector on the inertia ellipsoid, is known as the polhode, coined from Greek meaning "path of the pole". The surface created by the angular velocity vector is termed the body cone.
