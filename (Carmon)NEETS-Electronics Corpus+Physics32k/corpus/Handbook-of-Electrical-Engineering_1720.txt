It is possible to compute a nonlinear function of the pixels in the window. One of the more powerful nonlinear
.  In  this  operation  all  the  pixels  in  the  window  are  listed  in
 pixel is obtained. The median pixel then is used to replace
. The median Ô¨Ålter is used to remove noise from an image and at the same time preserve the edge structure
. These are also
