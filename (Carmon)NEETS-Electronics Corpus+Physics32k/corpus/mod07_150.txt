Semiconductor diodes have properties that enable them to perform many different electronic
functions. To do their jobs, engineers and technicians must be supplied with data on these different types
of diodes. The information presented for this purpose is called DIODE CHARACTERISTICS. These
characteristics are supplied by manufacturers either in their manuals or on specification sheets (data
sheets). Because of the scores of manufacturers and numerous diode types, it is not practical to put before
you a specification sheet and call it typical. Aside from the difference between manufacturers, a single
manufacturer may even supply specification sheets that differ both in format and content. Despite these
differences, certain performance and design information is normally required. We will discuss this
information in the next few paragraphs.
