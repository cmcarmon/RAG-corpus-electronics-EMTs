Figure 7.29 presents four different uses of the dielectric res-
onator, including two applications for millimeter-wave circuit
applications (for a nonradiative dielectric waveguide [NRD]
resonator and for a planar dielectric resonator (Ishikawa
et al., 1996). A cylindrical dielectric resonator as shown in
Figure 7.29(A) is probably the most commonly used structure
in which the low-permittivity dielectric substrate may be used
to keep the resonator in place. In this resonator structure, the
dominant resonant modes are usually the HE11d and TE01d
modes, respectively. The subscript d denotes the number of
resonating waves in the longitudinal direction of the resonator.
The lowest number is d ¼ 1. A complete ﬁeld solution for the
resonance properties of cylindrical resonators can be obtained
through ﬁeld modeling and matching the boundary conditions
at the air–dielectric interfaces.
