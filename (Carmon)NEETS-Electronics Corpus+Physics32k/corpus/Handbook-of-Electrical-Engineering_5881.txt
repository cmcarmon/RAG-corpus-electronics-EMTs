• Excitation  control  system.  Modern  excitation  systems  are  very  fast  and  quite  efﬁcient.  An  excitation
control system is a feedback loop that aims at keeping the voltage at machine terminals at a set level. To
explain  the  main  feature  of  the  excitation  system,  it  is  sufﬁcient  to  consider  Fig.  66.4. Assume  that  a
disturbance occurs in the system, and as a result, the machine’s terminal voltage Vt drops. The excitation
system boosts the internal voltage EF ; this action can increase the voltage Vt and also tends to increase
the reactive power output.
