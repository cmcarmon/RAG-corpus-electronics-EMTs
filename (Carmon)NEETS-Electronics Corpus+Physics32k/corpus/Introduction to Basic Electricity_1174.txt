OSHAâ€™s mission is twofold: one is to prevent work-
related illnesses, injuries, and death by issuing and 
enforcing workplace safety and health standards. The 
second is to create a better work environment for the 
workforce ensuring the safety of everyone. OSHA 
 accomplished this mission by making and enforcing 
certain standards to protect workers.
