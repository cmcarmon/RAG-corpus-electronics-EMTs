Consider a heat engine working between two temperatures TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle it may also be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs which are supposed to have a very large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the hot reservoir and Qa is added to the lower reservoir. Under normal operation TH > Ta and QH, Qa, and W are all positive.
As our thermodynamical system we take a big system which includes the engine and the two reservoirs. It is indicated in Fig.3 by the dotted rectangle. It is inhomogeneous, closed (no exchange of matter with its surroundings), and adiabatic (no exchange of heat with its surroundings). It is not isolated since per cycle a certain amount of work W is produced by the system given by the First law of thermodynamics

{\displaystyle W=Q_{H}-Q_{a}.}

We used the fact that the engine itself is periodic, so its internal energy has not changed after one cycle. The same is true for its entropy, so the entropy increase S2 - S1 of our system after one cycle is given by the reduction of entropy of the hot source and the increase of the cold sink. The entropy increase of the total system S2 - S1 is equal to the entropy production Si due to irreversible processes in the engine so

The Second law demands that Si ≥ 0. Eliminating Qa from the two relations gives

This equation tells us that the production of work is reduced by the generation of entropy. The term TaSi gives the lost work, or dissipated energy, by the machine.
Correspondingly, the amount of heat, discarded to the cold sink, is increased by the entropy generation

These important relations can also be obtained without the inclusion of the heat reservoirs. See the Article on entropy production.
