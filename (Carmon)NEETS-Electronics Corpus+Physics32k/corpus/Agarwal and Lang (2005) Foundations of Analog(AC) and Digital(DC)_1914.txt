Frequency response plots are commonly plotted using log scales. As we will
see shortly, log scales make the magnitudes of the responses due to capacitors
and inductors appear as straight lines in the graph. Log scales also allow us to
observe the response over many orders of magnitude variation in the frequency
without necessarily compressing the low frequency behavior of the response
(near zero rad/s) into the magnitude and phase axes. The frequency responses
for the resistor, inductor, and the capacitor can be sketched on log scales by
