The SMARAGD rocket (emerald in Danish) is a 5.7 meter two-stage rocket weighing 160 kg, intended to reach an altitude of 8 km, that was used for testing various technological aspects of the operation. On July 27, 2012, the team set out from Nex√∏ towards the launch site, intending to launch the SMARAGD rocket. After some initial problems with the remote launch control, the rocket launched successfully just after 1 pm and reached the maximum altitude of 8.2 km. It was evident shortly after take off that the nosecone, containing electronics, broke off during launch, possibly due to the large acceleration of estimated 20 g.
