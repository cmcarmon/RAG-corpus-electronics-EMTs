National Instrument’s Multisim (Figure 6-1) is an elec-
tronic schematic capture and simulation program that 
is part of a suite of electronic circuit design programs. 
Multisim uses the original Berkeley SPICE–based soft-
ware simulation. It includes a microcontroller simula-
tion as well as integrated import and export features 
to the printed circuit board layout software Ultiboard.
Multisim is widely used in education and indus-
try to provide education on circuit design, electronic 
schematic design, and SPICE simulation. National 
Instruments (NI) has maintained this educational 
component, with a specific version of Multisim that 
includes features developed for teaching electronics.
