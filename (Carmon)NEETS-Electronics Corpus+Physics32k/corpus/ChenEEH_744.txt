Many designs of VLSI systems assume a default organization
of background memories. In contrast, with a customized
memory organization, huge reductions are possible in the
cost of the data storage. It is no trivial task, however, to achieve
this cost reduction. This section ﬁrst shows the cost reduction
potential on the BTPC demonstrator. Then it explains the
difﬁculties to achieve this reduction. Finally, a methodological
approach to solve these problems is proposed.
