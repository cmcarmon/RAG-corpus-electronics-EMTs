An impulse J occurs when a force F acts over an interval of time Δt, and it is given by





J

=

∫

Δ
t



F



d

t
.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\int _{\Delta t}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} t.}

Since force is the time derivative of momentum, it follows that





J

=
Δ

p

=
m
Δ

v

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\Delta \mathbf {p} =m\Delta \mathbf {v} .}

This relation between impulse and momentum is closer to Newton's wording of the second law.
Impulse is a concept frequently used in the analysis of collisions and impacts.
