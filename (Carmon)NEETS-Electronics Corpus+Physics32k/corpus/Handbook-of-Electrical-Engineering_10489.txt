Effects of Divided Attention
Human operators in man-machine systems are, in general, involved in two types of operations—control tasks
and a diverse combination of monitoring/supervising/communicating/data-gathering/decision making activi-
ties  referred  to  as  “managerial  tasks.”  While  the  operator’s  attention  is  “divided”  between  the  control  and
managerial tasks, these are often performed nearly simultaneously as parallel processing operations.
