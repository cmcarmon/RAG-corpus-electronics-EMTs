Combinational Logic Circuits
The block diagram in Fig. 81.16 illustrates the model for combinational logic circuits. The logic elements inside
the block entitled combinational logic circuit can be any conﬁguration of two-state logic elements such that the
output signals are totally dependent on the input signals to the circuit as indicated by the functional relationships
in the ﬁgure.
