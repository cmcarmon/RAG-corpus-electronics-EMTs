The voltages induced in the two sides of the coil at position D are in the reverse direction to that of 
the voltages shown at position B. Note that the current is flowing from the black side to the white side in 
position B and from the white side to the black side in position D. However, because the segments of the 
commutator have rotated with the loop and are contacted by opposite brushes, the direction of current 
flow through the brushes and the meter remains the same as at position B. The voltage developed across 
the brushes is pulsating and unidirectional (in one direction only). It varies twice during each revolution 
between zero and maximum. This variation is called RIPPLE.
