input/output combinations involved. When using positive logic, the logic state of the inputs and outputs of
a digital IC can only be represented as either a high (also referred to as a 1 state) or as a low (also referred
to as a 0 state). In most digital circuitry, a high is a steady 5-vdc level, and a low is a 0-vdc level. You can
readily determine the logic state of an IC by using high-input-impedence measuring devices, such as an
oscilloscope. Because of the increased use of ICs in recent years, numerous pieces of test equipment have
been designed specifically for testing ICs. They are described in the following paragraphs.
