Amplifiers are classified by FUNCTION and FREQUENCY RESPONSE. Function refers to an 
amplifier being a VOLTAGE AMPLIFIER or a POWER AMPLIFIER. Voltage amplifiers provide 
voltage amplification and power amplifiers provide power amplification. The frequency response of an 
amplifier can be described by classifying the amplifier as an AUDIO AMPLIFIER, RF AMPLIFIER, or 
VIDEO (WIDE-BAND) AMPLIFIER. Audio amplifiers have frequency response in the range of 15 Hz to 
20 kHz. An rf amplifier has a frequency response in the range of 10 kHz to 100,000 MHz. A video 
(wide-band) amplifier has a frequency response of 10 Hz to 6 MHz.
