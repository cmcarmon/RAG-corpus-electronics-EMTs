Nonuniqueness
There is not a unique correct model of a given system for several reasons. The selection of idealized elements
to represent the system requires judgment based upon the intended purpose. For example, a satellite might be
modeled as a point mass in a study of its gross motion through space. A detailed ï¬‚exible structure model might
be required if the goal is to control vibration of a crucial on-board sensor. In empirical modeling, the assumed
starting form, Eq. (100.1), can vary.
