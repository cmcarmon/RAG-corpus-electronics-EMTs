In residential areas, the most commonly used is the single-phase three-wire 120/240-V radial system, where
the lighting loads are supplied by the 120 V and the larger household appliances (air conditioner, range, oven,
and  heating)  are  connected  to  the  240-V  lines.  Depending  on  the  location,  either  underground  cables  or
overhead lines are used for this system.
