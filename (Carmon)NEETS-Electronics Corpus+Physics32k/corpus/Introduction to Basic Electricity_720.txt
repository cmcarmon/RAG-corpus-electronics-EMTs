Solderless breadboards were developed to allow 
circuits to be assembled and altered quickly without 
soldering. The circuit is constructed using the actual 
components that would be used in assembling the 
 circuit on a PCB. A PCB is not easy to modify once the 
circuits are assembled. PCBs only allow minor altera-
tions following final assembly, such as changing resis-
tor or capacitor values or replacing integrated circuits 
with the same type of devices.
