Scan Path. The scan-path [Funatsu et al., 1975] approach can be seen as a generalization of the LSSD approach
since it follows the same principles but uses standard D-type ﬂip-ﬂops as the storage elements instead of the
SRLs. The scannable ﬂip-ﬂops can be implemented using dual-ported latches (similar to the L1 latch in the
SRL) or using a multiplexor to select between the scan-in and system data-in signals to feed the D input of a
standard D-type ﬂip-ﬂop, as shown in Fig. 85.14.
