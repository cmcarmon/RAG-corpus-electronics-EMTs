This  reaction  involves  the  reduction  of  molecular  oxygen  that  diffuses  into  the  cell  through  the  oxygen-
permeable membrane. Since the other components of the reaction are in abundance, the rate of the reaction
is limited by the amount of oxygen available. Thus, the rate of electrons used at the cathode is directly related
to the available oxygen. In other words, the cathode current is proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen
in the specimen being measured.
