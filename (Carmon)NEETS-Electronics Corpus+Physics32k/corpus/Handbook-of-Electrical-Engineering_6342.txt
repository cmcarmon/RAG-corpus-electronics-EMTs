DAB System Design Goals
DAB systems are being designed with several technical goals in mind. The Ô¨Årst goal is to create a service that
delivers compact disc quality stereo sound for broadcast to consumers. The second is to overcome the inter-
ference problems of current AM and FM broadcasts, especially under portable and mobile reception conditions.
