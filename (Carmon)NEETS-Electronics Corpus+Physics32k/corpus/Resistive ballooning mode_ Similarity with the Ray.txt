The RBM instability is similar to the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (RT), with Earth gravity






g

{\displaystyle {\vec {g}}}
replaced by the effective gravity







g

f




{\displaystyle {\vec {g}}_{eff}}
, except that for the RT instability,






g

{\displaystyle {\vec {g}}}
acts on the mass density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
of the fluid, whereas for the RBM instability,

e
f
f




{\displaystyle {\vec {g}}_{eff}}
acts on the pressure



p

of the plasma.
