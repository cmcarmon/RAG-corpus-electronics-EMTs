The slot antenna consists of a radiator formed by cutting a narrow slot in a large metal surface. Such 
an antenna is shown in figure 3-18. The slot length is a half wavelength at the desired frequency and the 
width is a small fraction of a wavelength. The antenna is frequently compared to a conventional half-
wave dipole consisting of two flat metal strips. The physical dimensions of the metal strips are such that 
they would just fit into the slot cut out of the large metal sheet.
