Obviously, the very best way to evaluate Kalman Ô¨Ålter performance is to conduct extensive real-world testing.
Unfortunately, the cost and practicality of this approach is often prohibitive or is deemed to be not cost-effective.
A judicious combination of extensive Monte Carlo simulation and limited real-world testing is often the most
practical approach to performance evaluation.
