Anamnesis
Injuries to the TFCC may be preceded by a fall on a pronated outstretched arm; a rotational injury to the forearm; an axial load trauma to the wrist; or a distraction injury of the wrist in ulnar direction. However, not all patients can recall a preceding trauma occurred.
Physical examination
Palpation: the best place to palpate the TFCC is between the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU), distal to the ulnar styloid and proximal to the pisiform bone. Tenderness in this area may be consistent with a TFCC lesion.
Piano key sign: dorsal DRUJ instability can cause a protruding ulna head, which can be pressed down. When you release the pressure, it will spring back in position again, just like a piano key.
DRUJ stress test: with this provocation manoeuver the wrist is held in pronated or supinated position, while the physician attempts to manipulate the distal ulna in dorsal and volar direction. Painful laxity indicates DRUJ instability and suggests RUL pathology.
Ulnar grind test: the forearm is fixated and the wrist is held in dorsiflexion. The physician then applies axial load, while he rotates and deviates the wrist in ulnar direction. Pain and crepitations during this provocation manoeuvre suggest DRUJ instability or arthritis.
Wendy Medeiros, OTR, CHT(ret) has designed a weight-bearing test to objectively analyze the stability of the wrist. This test has defined stability based on age, height and bone density. She has also developed a conservative management protocol for the treatment of TFCC tears after 12 years of research around the globe.
