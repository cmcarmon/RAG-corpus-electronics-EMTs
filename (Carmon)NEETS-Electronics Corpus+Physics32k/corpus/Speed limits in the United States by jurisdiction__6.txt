The maximum speed limit in Michigan is 75 mph (121 km/h). Michigan uses a formula based on the number of driveways and streets, or on the 85th percentile of free-flowing traffic, and if none those methods are used a 55 mph (89 km/h) default applies. In rural areas, speed limits are as follows:
Freeway speeds for passenger vehicles range from 70 mph (110 km/h) 75 mph (121 km/h).
Freeway speeds for trucks and military vehicles is 65 mph (105 km/h).
Non-freeway speeds for passenger vehicles and trucks range from 55 mph (89 km/h) to 65 mph (105 km/h).
Freeways in Michigan are usually signed with both minimum and maximum speeds. By default, the freeway speed limit is 70 mph (110 km/h), with a minimum speed of 55 mph (89 km/h) for all vehicles, despite a truck speed limit of 65 mph (105 km/h)â€”effectively permitting trucks only a 10 mph (16 km/h) range of legal speeds. The Mackinac Bridge, due to its substandard design, has a speed limit of 45 mph (72 km/h) for passenger vehicles and 20 mph (32 km/h) for trucks. The Michigan Department of Transportation and the Michigan State Police may raise the speed limit to 75 mph (121 km/h) after it is deemed safe to do so.  MDOT and the MSP announced on April 26, 2017 that the speed limit was increased to 75 mph on several Michigan freeways, including I-75 from Bay City to Sault Ste. Marie (excluding the Mackinac Bridge), I-69 from Business Loop 69 in Clinton County to I-94 in St. Clair County (excluding the section in and around Flint, which remains at 70 mph (110 km/h)), US 127 from I-69 in Clinton County to I-75 in Crawford County (excluding the 15-mile stretch between St. Johns and Ithaca, which is not freeway standard), and US 131 from M-57 in Kent County to the end of the freeway north of Manton. These increases commenced on May 1, 2017 and were completed by May 15, 2017. Speed limits in freeway work zones are statutorily limited to 60 mph (97 km/h) 24 hours per day. If workers are present (and not behind a barrier wall), drivers must slow to 45 mph (72 km/h) for the workers' safety.
Michigan's speed limits on urban Interstates are typically higher than its neighboring states. For example, in the Detroit metro area, I-75 southbound enters Detroit at M-102 (8 Mile Road, exit 59) and maintains a 70 mph (110 km/h) limit all the way until the interchange with I-94 (exit 53), where the speed limit drops to 55 mph (89 km/h). Other freeways in Detroit such as I-94 and I-96 also have 55 mph (89 km/h) speed limits in and around the city's downtown area, but rise to 70 mph (110 km/h) relatively soon after leaving the downtown area. In Downtown Grand Rapids, I-196 has a speed limit of 65 mph (105 km/h), the only other urban Interstate Highway to have a reduced speed limit. US 131 in Grand Rapids is one of the only non-Interstate urban freeways in Michigan with a 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) speed limit, which was raised from 55 miles per hour (89 km/h) since 2013. Furthermore, speed limits in smaller cities, such as Kalamazoo, Ann Arbor, and Lansing (the state capital) remain at 70 mph (110 km/h).
The default speed on all other highways, whether two or four lanes, is 55 mph (89 km/h). However, Michigan permits speed limits of up to 65 mph (105 km/h) after a safety study concludes the higher limit is safe to implement. Until 2016, this provision only applied to four-lane divided non-limited access highways. A 20-mile (32 km) stretch of US 127 between St. Johns and Ithaca was posted at 65 mph (105 km/h), as a compromise to allow a freer flow of traffic due to insufficient funds to improve the section to freeway standards. The speed limit on US 2 between Rapid River and Gladstone in the Upper Peninsula was also raised to 65 mph (105 km/h). In Summer 2017 Speed limits began increasing to 65 mph on several select two-lane roads in both the Lower and Upper Peninsulas of Michigan, including US 2 from St. Ignace to Rapid River and M-28 from I-75 to Munising.
