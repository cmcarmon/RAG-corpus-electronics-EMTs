When designing to a speciÔ¨Åc power, both IB and VL can be determined. This allows the selection of the value
of R2 and the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 28.10 can be developed. Using this equivalent circuit, both the
input resistance and the current gain can be shown. Rf  is the forward resistance of the diodes.
