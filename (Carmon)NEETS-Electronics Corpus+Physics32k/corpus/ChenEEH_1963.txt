The control ﬂow of a program can be represented by a
control ﬂow graph (CFG) in which the nodes represent
some program unit, and edges represent the syntactically
allowed ﬂow of control. A node can be a single statement or
a block of statements. Formally, a node of the CFG is a block of
the program with exactly one entry point at the top of the
block and exactly one exit point at the bottom of the block.
The last instruction in a block may be a branch or
jump
instruction, although this is not necessary. There is an arc in
the CFG from node i to node j if the program execution can
correctly ﬂow from the last instruction of block i to the ﬁrst
instruction of block j. An example of CFG extraction from a
program is shown in Figure 8.11.
