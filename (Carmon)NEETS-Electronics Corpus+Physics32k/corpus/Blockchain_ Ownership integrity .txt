To make sure only the owner of an account is able draw from it, one needs a way to verify ownership using only the ledger itself. To this end a transaction in the ledger consists of three things. A public key of the account from which money is drawn, a public key of the account to which money is sent and an encoded message approving the transaction. This encoded message is encoded by the private key of the account owner and can be decoded by anyone using the public key that was registered as the sender in the ledger. This verification procedure is called a digital signature and is comparable to the authentication step of the https protocol. Note that the public key plays a dual role, it is both the account number itself as well as a way to verify the digital signature.
Due to the fact that encoding can only be done by the owner with his/her private key and decoding can be done by anyone using the public key everyone can check for him or herself that the one who drew upon an account with a certain public key has the corresponding private key.
