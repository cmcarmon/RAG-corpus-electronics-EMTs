When we speak, pitch and the vocal tract’s transfer function are not static; they change according to their
control signals to produce speech. Engineers typically display how the speech spectrum changes over time
with what is known as a spectrogram (detailed in Section 5.10), an example of which is shown in Figure 4.17.
Note how the line spectrum, which indicates how the pitch changes, is visible during the vowels, but not
during the consonants (like the ce in “Rice”).
