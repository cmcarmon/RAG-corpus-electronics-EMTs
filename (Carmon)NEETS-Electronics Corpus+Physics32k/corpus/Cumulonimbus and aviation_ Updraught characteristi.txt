The updraughts under a cumulonimbus can be extremely laminar, extensive, and uniform, this is particularly true during the buildup of the thunderstorm. They can last more than one hour and correspond to a steady state of the cumulonimbus.
The updraught under the cloud is mostly due to buoyancy, but there is also a large pressure difference between the base and the top of the cumulonimbus (larger than would be found in this height range outside the cloud) and local low-level mechanical lifting such as the lifting generated by a downburst. The two last phenomena can overcome a stable air zone close to the surface by lifting cooler air parcels to a level where they are eventually warmer than the surrounding air. This can happen if these mechanical phenomena lift the parcel above the lifted condensation level (LCL), above which height the parcel's temperature Tp(z) decreases less with height (due to the release of latent heat and at approximately 6.5 K/km) than the surrounding air temperature Ts(z) decreases with height in the case of a conditionally unstable lapse rate aloft. In other words, the parcel can be lifted to a height where

, where the former is the cooling rate of the parcel and the latter is the ambient lapse rate. In these conditions, the rising parcel may eventually become warmer than the surrounding air; in other words, there may exist a level above which

. This scenario's conditionally unstable lapse rate aloft is relatively common when thunderstorms exist. In effect, at low level, such air parcels are sucked into the cloud as if by a vacuum cleaner. Soaring pilots refer to this near-base sucking as "cloud suck", a phenomenon known to generally be more intense the taller the cumulus cloud - and to thus be at maximum intensity with a cumulonimbus. Since the dynamic updraught is wide, the updraught velocity varies little laterally and thus the turbulence is minimised. So, it is said:

The observations reported by Marwitz (1973), Grandia and Marwitz (1975), and Ellrod and Marwitz (1976) indicate that the updraft air entering the base of cumulonimbi is smooth and relatively free of turbulence and remains so through a significant depth of the WER.

In fact, Ellrod and Marwitz's paper is more general. These authors state that in general, the buoyancy beneath the cumulonimbus cloud base is often negative. This explains why updraughts underneath the base of a cumulonimbus are often laminar. This phenomenon is well known by glider pilots. (see below). The phenomenon is enhanced under the weak echo region of a supercell thunderstorm that is extremely dangerous. At approximately 4 kilometres (13,000 ft) these smooth updraughts become suddenly very turbulent.
In general, updraughts reach their maximum intensity at 6 kilometres (20,000 ft) above the ground. At this altitude, a phase change occurs where water droplets become ice crystals and therefore release energy in the form of latent heat and thus the updraught strength increases. Supercell thunderstorms or derechos can have gigantic updraughts at this altitude, updraughts with speeds that can exceed 40 metres per second (78 kn). Such an updraught speed corresponds to the wind speed of a small hurricane. The speed can even exceed 50 metres per second (97 kn). The maximum number in the Beaufort scale is 12 ("hurricane force" wind) and is assigned to wind speeds of 64 knots or greater. If the Beaufort scale were extended, these updraughts would have a Beaufort number of 14 in the vertical direction. The turbulence is then extreme at this altitude.
Moreover, the diameters of the updraught columns vary between 2 km (air mass thunderstorm) and 10 km (supercell thunderstorm). The height of the cumulonimbus base is extremely variable. It varies from a few tens of metres above the ground to 4000 m above the ground. In the latter case, the updraughts can originate either from the ground (if the air is very dry - typical of deserts) or from aloft (when altocumulus castellanus degenerates into cumulonimbus). When the updraught originates from aloft, this is considered elevated convection.
