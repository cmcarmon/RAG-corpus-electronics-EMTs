4.3.2 When the two-wattmeter method for measuring
three-phase power is used on a certain balanced
load, readings of 1200 W and 400 W are obtained
(without any reversals). Determine the delta-
connected load impedances if the system voltage
is 440 V. With the information given, is it possible
to Ô¨Ånd whether the load impedance is capacitive
or inductive in nature?
