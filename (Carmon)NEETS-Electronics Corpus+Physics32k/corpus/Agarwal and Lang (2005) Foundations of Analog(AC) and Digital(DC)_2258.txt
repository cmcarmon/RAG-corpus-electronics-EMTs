It is somewhat messy to calculate the exact voltages or times at which the
diode switches state. But frequently in nonlinear circuit design the fundamental
design constraints of the circuit make exact calculations of this sort unneces-
sary. For example, for rectifier applications, it is desirable to have the RC time
constant much longer than the sine wave period, as we shall see. In this case
the diode switches to the OFF state only a few degrees beyond the peak of the
wave. Hence the starting amplitude for vC in the diode OFF state is roughly
the peak of the input sine wave, and the OFF state waveform is
