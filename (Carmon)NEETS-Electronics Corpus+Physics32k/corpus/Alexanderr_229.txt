Career in Electronic Instrumentation
Engineering involves applying physical principles to design devices for
the  beneﬁt  of  humanity.  But  physical  principles  cannot  be  understood
without  measurement.  In  fact,  physicists  often  say  that  physics  is  the
science that measures reality. Just as measurements are a tool for under-
standing  the  physical  world,  instruments  are  tools  for  measurement.
The operational ampliﬁer introduced in this chapter is a building block
of modern electronic instrumentation. Therefore, mastery of operational
ampliﬁer  fundamentals  is  paramount  to  any  practical  application  of
electronic circuits.
