The computers of this generation (1964-1970), many of which are still in use, are characterized by 
miniaturized circuits. This reduces the physical size of computers even more and increases their durability 
and internal processing speeds. One design employs solid-state logic microcircuits (fig. 1-8) for which 
conductors, resistors, diodes, and transistors have been miniaturized and combined on half-inch ceramic 
squares. Another smaller design uses silicon wafers on which the circuit and its components are etched. 
The smaller circuits allow for faster internal processing speeds resulting in faster execution of 
instructions. Internal processing speeds are measured in billionths of a second (nanoseconds). The faster 
computers make it possible to run jobs that were considered impractical or impossible on first or second 
generation equipment. Because the miniature components are more reliable, maintenance is reduced. New 
mass storage, such as the data cell, was introduced during this generation, giving a storage capacity of 
over 100 million characters. Drum and disk capacities and speed have been increased, the portable disk 
pack has been developed, and faster, higher density magnetic tapes have come into use. Considerable 
improvements were made to card readers and printers, while the overall cost has been greatly reduced. 
Applications using online processing, real-time processing, time sharing, multiprogramming, 
multiprocessing, and teleprocessing have become widely accepted. More on this in later chapters.
