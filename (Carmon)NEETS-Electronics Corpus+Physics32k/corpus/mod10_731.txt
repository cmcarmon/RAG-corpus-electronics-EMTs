OPERATION.â€”When a parasitic element is placed a fraction of a wavelength away from the 
driven element and is of approximately resonant length, it will re-radiate the energy it intercepts. The 
parasitic element is effectively a tuned circuit coupled to the driven element, much as the two windings of 
a transformer are coupled together. The radiated energy from the driven element causes a voltage to be 
developed in the parasitic element, which, in turn, sets up a magnetic field. This magnetic field extends 
over to the driven element, which then has a voltage induced in it. The magnitude and phase of the 
induced voltage depend on the length of the parasitic element and the spacing between the elements. In 
actual practice the length and spacing are arranged so that the phase and magnitude of the induced voltage 
cause a unidirectional, horizontal-radiation pattern and an increase in gain.
