Professor Zoom appears in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), voiced by C. Thomas Howell. He hires the Rogues to ambush the Flash (Barry Allen) at the Flash Museum before betraying them by placing explosives on their belts to destroy the museum. However, the Justice League arrive to disarm the bombs and apprehend Thawne. When Barry travels back in time to prevent Nora Allen's murder, all of reality is altered, and Aquaman's Atlantean army is at war with Wonder Woman's Amazonian forces. Zoom enters this reality via the Speed Force and saves Lois Lane from the Amazonians to alert Barry of his presence. While Cyborg's metahuman team tries to put an end to the war, Zoom appears and beats Barry. As the Atlanteans' doomsday device destroys the world, Zoom is shot in the head by this reality's Batman. The Flash then taps into the Speed Force once more to stop his past self from altering time, effectively creating a new reality similar to the original.
Professor Zoom will appear in Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay (2018), voiced again by C. Thomas Howell.
