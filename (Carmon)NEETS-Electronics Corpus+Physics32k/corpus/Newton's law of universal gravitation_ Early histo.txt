A recent assessment (by Ofer Gal) about the early history of the inverse square law is "by the late 1670s", the assumption of an "inverse proportion between gravity and the square of distance was rather common and had been advanced by a number of different people for different reasons".
The same author does credit Hooke with a significant and even seminal contribution, but he treats Hooke's claim of priority on the inverse square point as uninteresting since several individuals besides Newton and Hooke had at least suggested it, and he points instead to the idea of "compounding the celestial motions" and the conversion of Newton's thinking away from "centrifugal" and towards "centripetal" force as Hooke's significant contributions.
Newton himself gave credit in his Principia to two persons: Bullialdus (he wrote without proof that there was a force on the earth towards the sun), and Borelli (wrote that all planets were attracted towards the sun). Whiteside wrote that the main influence was Borelli, because Newton had a copy of his book.
