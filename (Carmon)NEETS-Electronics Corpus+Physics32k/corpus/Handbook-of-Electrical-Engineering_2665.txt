Technology Perspective
A  solid  state  IC  is  a  group  of  interconnected  circuit  elements  formed  on  or  within  a  continuous  substrate.
While an integrated circuit may be based on many different material systems, silicon is by far the dominant
material. More than 98% of contemporary electronic devices are based on silicon technology. On the order of
85% of silicon ICs are complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices.
