Conclusions
Each of the six standard conﬁgurations has speciﬁc advantages and disadvantages. When choosing a manipulator
for  a  task,  the  properties  of  the  manipulator  geometry  are  one  of  the  most  important  considerations.  If  the
manipulator will be used for a wide variety of tasks, one may need to trade off performance for any given task
for the ﬂexibility that will allow the manipulator to work for the various tasks. In such a case, a more ﬂexible
geometry should be considered. The future of robotics will be interesting. With the steady increase in compu-
tational capabilities, the more complex geometries, including redundant and multiple robots, are beginning to
see increased applications in industry.
