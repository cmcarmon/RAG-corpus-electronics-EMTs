Our alternative analysis of the circuit in Figure 2.51a follows the two basic
moves suggested earlier
first collapse, then expand. Accordingly, our anal-
ysis begins by collapsing the circuit using the equivalence of parallel and series
resistors. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.51. Note that all branch variables
that can be preserved during this collapse are shown in Figure 2.51. First, the
series resistors R3 and R4 are combined to yield the circuit in Figure 2.51b.
Next, R2 is combined in parallel with the series equivalent of R3 and R4 to
yield the circuit in Figure 2.51c. Finally, the two remaining series resistors are
combined in series to yield the circuit in Figure 2.51d.
