A PAPER CAPACITOR is made of flat thin strips of metal foil conductors that are separated by waxed
paper (the dielectric material). Paper capacitors usually range in value from about 300 picofarads to about 4
microfarads. The working voltage of a paper capacitor rarely exceeds 600 volts. Paper capacitors are sealed
with wax to prevent the harmful effects of moisture and to prevent corrosion and leakage.
