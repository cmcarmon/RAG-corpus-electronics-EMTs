A function generator is a type of signal genera-
tor and is a common piece of electronic test equip-
ment. The function generator is capable of generating 
fundamental waveforms such as sine waves, triangular 
waveforms, and square waveforms. The voltage, sym-
metry, and time characteristics of a waveform can be 
adjusted to meet a specific application.
