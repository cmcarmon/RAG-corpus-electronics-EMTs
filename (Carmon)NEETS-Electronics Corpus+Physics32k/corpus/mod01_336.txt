As stated before, the differences between primary and secondary cells are, the secondary cell can be 
recharged and the electrodes are made of different materials. The secondary cell shown in figure 2-3 uses 
sponge lead as the cathode and lead peroxide as the anode. This is the lead-acid type cell and will be used 
to explain the general chemistry of the secondary cell. Later in the chapter when other types of secondary 
cells are discussed, you will see that the materials which make up the parts of a cell are different, but that 
the chemical action is essentially the same.
