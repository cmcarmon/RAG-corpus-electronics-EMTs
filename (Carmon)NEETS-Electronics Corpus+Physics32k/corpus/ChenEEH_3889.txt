Figure 5.5 shows the transcoding of the image without using
transcoding hints. In this case, the original image is adapted to
the screen sizes by globally rescaling the image to ﬁt the screen.
The drawback of this type of adaptation is that the image
details are lost when the size of the output image is small.
For example, it is difﬁcult to discern any details from the image
displayed on the PDA screen (far right). The result is an equal
loss of detail for all regions including those important regions,
which results in a lower overall content value of the image for a
display size.
