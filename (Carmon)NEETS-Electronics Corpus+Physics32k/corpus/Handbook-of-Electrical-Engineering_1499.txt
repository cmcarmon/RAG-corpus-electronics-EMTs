Consider a ﬁrst-order N-state Markov chain as illustrated for N = 3 in Fig. 15.21. Such a random process has
the simplest memory: the value at time t depends only on the value at the preceding time and on nothing that
went on before. However, it has a very useful property that leads to its application to speech recognition problem:
the states of the chain generate observation sequences while the state sequence itself is hidden from the observer.
The system can be described as being one of the N distinct states, S1, S2, …, SN, at any discrete time instant t.
We use the state variable qt as the state of the system at time t. Assume that the Markov chain is time invariant
(homogeneous), so the transition probabilities do not depend on time. The Markov chain is then described by
a state transition probability matrix A = [aij], where
