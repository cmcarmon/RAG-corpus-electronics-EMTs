Comparing LSR to Ls, authors ﬁnd values of LSR between 1.17 and 1.23 Ls.
Brightness
Brightness is measured as area brightness (raster luminance) LR or peak line brightness Lp. Peak line brightness
is an inverse function of the writing speed, a direct function of the refresh rate of the displayed line and, of
course,  of  the  beam  current.  Raster  luminance  LR  is  related  to  the  raster  emitting  surface  (S),  to  the  beam
current (I), to the screen efﬁciency (e), transmission (T) of the faceplate, and to the screen voltage (Vs) by the
formula
