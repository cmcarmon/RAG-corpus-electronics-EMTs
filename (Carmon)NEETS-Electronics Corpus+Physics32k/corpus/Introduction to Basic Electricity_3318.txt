The forward and reverse resistance should be checked 
with a low-voltage ohmmeter on its highest scale. 
MOSFETs  have  extremely  high  input  resistance 
 because of the insulated gate. The meter should reg-
ister an infinite resistance in both the forward- and 
reverse-resistance tests between the gate and source or 
drain. A lower reading indicates a breakdown of the 
insulation between the gate and source or drain.
