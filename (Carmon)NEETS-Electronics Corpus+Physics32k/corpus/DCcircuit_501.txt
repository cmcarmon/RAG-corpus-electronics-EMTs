Notice that in this parallel circuit, an open branch only affects the current through that
branch and the circuit’s total current. Total voltage – being shared equally across all compo-
nents in a parallel circuit, will be the same for all resistors. Due to the fact that the voltage
source’s tendency is to hold voltage constant, its voltage will not change, and being in parallel
with all the resistors, it will hold all the resistors’ voltages the same as they were before: 9
volts. Being that voltage is the only common parameter in a parallel circuit, and the other re-
sistors haven’t changed resistance value, their respective branch currents remain unchanged.
This is what happens in a household lamp circuit: all lamps get their operating voltage
from power wiring arranged in a parallel fashion. Turning one lamp on and off (one branch
in that parallel circuit closing and opening) doesn’t affect the operation of other lamps in the
room, only the current in that one lamp (branch circuit) and the total current powering all the
lamps in the room:
