Color Signal Encoding
To facilitate an orderly introduction of color television broadcasting in the United States and other countries
with existing monochrome services, it was essential that the new transmissions be compatible. In other words,
color pictures would provide acceptable quality on unmodiﬁed monochrome receivers. In addition, because of
the limited availability of the RF spectrum, another related requirement was the need to ﬁt approximately 2-
MHz bandwidth of color information into the 4.2-MHz video bandwidth of the existing 6-MHz broadcasting
channels with little or no modiﬁcation of existing transmitters. This is accomplished by using the band-sharing
color signal system developed by the NTSC and by taking advantage of the fundamental characteristics of the
eye regarding color sensitivity and resolution.
