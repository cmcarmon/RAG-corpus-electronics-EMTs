Let G = (V, E) and G′ = (V′, E′) be two graphs. Graph G′ is a sub-graph of graph G (written as G′ ⊆ G) if V′ ⊆ V and E′ ⊆ E ∩ (V′ × V′). If G′ ⊆ G and G′ contains all of the edges ‹u, v› ∈ E with u, v ∈ V′, then G′ is an induced sub-graph of G. We call G′ and G isomorphic (written as G′ ↔ G), if there exists a bijection (one-to-one) f:V′ → V with ‹u, v› ∈ E′ ⇔ ‹f(u), f(v)› ∈ E for all u, v ∈ V′. The mapping f is called an isomorphism between G and G′.
When G″ ⊂ G and there exists an isomorphism between the sub-graph G″ and a graph G′, this mapping represents an appearance of G′ in G. The number of appearances of graph G′ in G is called the frequency FG of G′ in G. A graph is called recurrent (or frequent) in G, when its frequency FG(G′) is above a predefined threshold or cut-off value. We use terms pattern and frequent sub-graph in this review interchangeably. There is an ensemble Ω(G) of random graphs corresponding to the null-model associated to G. We should choose N random graphs uniformly from Ω(G) and calculate the frequency for a particular frequent sub-graph G′ in G. If the frequency of G′ in G is higher than its arithmetic mean frequency in N random graphs Ri, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N, we call this recurrent pattern significant and hence treat G′ as a network motif for G. For a small graph G′, the network G and a set of randomized networks R(G) ⊆ Ω(R), where R(G) = N, the Z-Score that has been defined by the following formula:

{\displaystyle Z(G^{\prime })={\frac {F_{G}(G^{\prime })-\mu _{R}(G^{\prime })}{\sigma _{R}(G^{\prime })}}}

where μR(G′) and σR(G′) stand for mean and standard deviation frequency in set R(G), respectively. The larger the Z(G′), the more significant is the sub-graph G′ as a motif. Alternatively, another measurement in statistical hypothesis testing that can be considered in motif detection is the P-Value, given as the probability of FR(G′) ≥ FG(G′) (as its null-hypothesis), where FR(G′) indicates the frequency of G' in a randomized network. A sub-graph with P-value less than a threshold (commonly 0.01 or 0.05) will be treated as a significant pattern. The P-value is defined as

Where N indicates number of randomized networks, i is defined over an ensemble of randomized networks and the Kronecker delta function δ(c(i)) is one if the condition c(i) holds. The concentration  of a particular n-size sub-graph G′ in network G refers to the ratio of the sub-graph appearance in the network to the total n-size non-isomorphic sub-graphs’ frequencies, which is formulated by

where index i is defined over the set of all non-isomorphic n-size graphs. Another statistical measurement is defined for evaluating network motifs, but it is rarely used in known algorithms. This measurement is introduced by Picard et al. in 2008 and used the Poisson distribution, rather than the Gaussian normal distribution that is implicitly being used above.
In addition, three specific concepts of sub-graph frequency have been proposed. As figure illustrates, the first frequency concept F1 considers all matches of a graph in original network. This definition is similar to what we have introduced above. The second concept F2 is defined as the maximum number of edge-disjoint instances of a given graph in original network. And finally, the frequency concept F3 entails matches with disjoint edges and nodes. Therefore, the two concepts F2 and F3 restrict the usage of elements of the graph, and as can be inferred, the frequency of a sub-graph declines by imposing restrictions on network element usage. As a result, a network motif detection algorithm would pass over more candidate sub-graphs if we insist on frequency concepts F2 and F3.
