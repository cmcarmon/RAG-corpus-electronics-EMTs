Two types of capacitors are associated with a pn-diode: the junction capacitance CJ (also
known as depletion capacitance or space-charge capacitance), which is dominant for a reverse-
bias diode; and the diffusion capacitance CD, which is most signiÔ¨Åcant for the forward-bias
condition and is usually negligible for a reverse-biased diode. For applications where the diode
capacitance is important, the small-signal equivalent circuit under back (reverse)-biased operation
includes Rr in parallel with CJ, and the parallel combination of Rf, CJ, and CD for forward-biased
operation.
