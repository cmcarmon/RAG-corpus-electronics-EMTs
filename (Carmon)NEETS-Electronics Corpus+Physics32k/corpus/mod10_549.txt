If you try different values of RL in the preceding equation, you will find that the reflected voltage is
equal to the incident voltage only when RL equals 0 or is infinitely large. When RL equals Z0, no reflected
voltage occurs. When RL is greater than Z0, ER is positive, but less than Ei. As RL increases and
