NumberCount( )
We enter the program at the top with one pointer passed from the calling routine and a set of local variables
comprising two integers and eight Boolean variables. Most of the Boolean variables will be used in pairs. The

ﬁrst element of a pair, for instance,

 a number. Were you to limit your numbers to integers, these two are the only Booleans which would be
needed.  At  the  top  of  the  program,  all  Booleans  are  reset  (made  FALSE).  Then  we  step  through  the  block
looking for numbers. The search stops when we encounter the ﬁrst null [char(0)] marking the end of the block.
Try running through the routine with text containing the three forms of number. You will quickly convince
yourself that the routine works with all normal numbers. If someone writes “3..14” or “3.14ee6”, the program
will count 2 numbers. That is probably right in the ﬁrst two cases. Who knows in the third?
