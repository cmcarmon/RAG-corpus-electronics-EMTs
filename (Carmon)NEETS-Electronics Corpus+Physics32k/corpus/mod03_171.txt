The ohmmeter described to this point is known as a series ohmmeter, because the resistance to be
measured is in series with the internal resistors and the meter movement of the ohmmeter. Another type of
ohmmeter is the SHUNT OHMMETER. In the shunt ohmmeter, the resistance to be measured shunts (is
in parallel with) the meter movement of the ohmmeter. The most obvious way to tell the difference
between the series and shunt ohmmeters is by the scale of the meter. Figure 1-34 shows the scale of a
series ohmmeter and the scale of a shunt ohmmeter.
