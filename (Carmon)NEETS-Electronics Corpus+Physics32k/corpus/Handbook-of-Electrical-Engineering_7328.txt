The  sample-and-hold  phase  detector  is  widely  used  where  optimum  noise  performance  is  required.  This
circuit operates by using one of the phase detector inputs to sample the voltage on the other input. This latter
input is usually converted to a triangle wave to give a linear phase detector characteristic. Once the input is
sampled, its voltage is held using a capacitor. The good noise performance is achieved since most of the time
the phase detector output is simply a stored charge on this capacitor. The phase range of the sample-and-hold
phase detector depends on the type of waveform shaping used and can range from
