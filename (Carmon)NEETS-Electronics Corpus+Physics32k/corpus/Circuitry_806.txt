The  PIC16F  family  is  very  large  and 
includes  devices  in  14-,  18-,  28-  and 
40-pin  packages.  The  chips  vary  in 
terms  of  the  amount  of  memory  they 
provide  and  also  in  their  I/O  features. 
Some devices worth noting include the 
PIC16F630,  PIC16F676,  PIC16F684 
and  PIC16F688,  which  are  14-pin 
the  PIC12F  devices 
equivalents 
mentioned  above, 
the  PIC16F84A, 
which is the most current equivalent to 
the  popular  PIC16C84,  and 
the 
PIC16F877A,  which  is  a  powerful  40-
pin  device  that  has  become  extremely 
popular.  The  PIC16F877A  features 
8192  Ã—  14-bit  Flash  program  memory, 
368  bytes  of  RAM  data  memory,  256 
bytes  of  EEPROM  data  memory,  33 
digital  I/O  lines,  eight  10-bit  A/D 
channels,  three  counter/timers  and  a 
serial port (USART). 
The  PIC18F  devices  form  the  new 
high-end  range.  One  feature  that  they 
all  share  is  that  their  instruction  set  is 
optimized  for  C  compilers.  Many 
feature  large  amounts  of  memory  and 
special I/O features including Universal 
Serial  Bus  (USB)  and  Controller  Area 
interfaces.  One 
Network  (CAN) 
interesting  device 
the  40-pin 
PIC18F452,  which  is  similar  in  many 
respects  and  pin-compatible  with  the 
PIC16F877A.  It  is  also  worth  noting 
that some PIC18F devices are supplied 
in  80-pin  packages  and  provide  more 
than  70  digital  I/O  lines.  However, 
these  are  in  surface-mount  packages 
and so are difficult to experiment with!
