Limiting current through the LED
Resistor R3 is there to keep you from frying your LED. This lowly resistor 
performs the important job of limiting the current passing through the LED. 
The output voltage at pin 3 of the 555 timer varies between 9 V (the positive 
power supply) when the pulse is on and 0 V when the pulse is off.
