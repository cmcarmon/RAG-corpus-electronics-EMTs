Practical Sources
The preceding ideal independent sources constrain the terminal voltage or current to a known function of time
independent of the circuit that may be placed across its terminals. Practical sources, such as batteries, have their
terminal voltage (current) dependent upon the terminal current (voltage) caused by the circuit attached to the
source terminals. A simple example of this is an automobile storage battery. The battery’s terminal voltage is
approximately  12 V  when  no  load  is  connected  across  its  terminals.  When  the  battery  is  applied  across  the
terminals of the starter by activating the ignition switch, a large current is drawn from its terminals. During
starting, its terminal voltage drops as illustrated in Fig. 2.9(a). How shall we construct a circuit model using the
ideal elements discussed thus far to model this nonideal behavior? A model is shown in Fig. 2.9(b) and consists
of the series connection of an ideal resistor, RS, and an ideal independent voltage source, VS = 12 V. To determine
the terminal voltage–current relation, we sum Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the loop to give
