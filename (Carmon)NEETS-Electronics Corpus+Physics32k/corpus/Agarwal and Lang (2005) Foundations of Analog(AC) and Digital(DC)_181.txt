We will see two types of voltage sources: independent and dependent. An
independent voltage source supplies a voltage independent of the rest of the
circuit. Accordingly, independent sources are a means through which inputs
can be made to a circuit. Power supplies, signal generators, and microphones
are examples of independent voltage sources. The circle symbol in Figure 1.26b
represents an independent voltage source. In contrast to an independent voltage
source, a dependent voltage source supplies a voltage as commanded by a signal
from within the circuit of which the source is a part. Dependent sources are
most commonly used to model elements having more than two terminals. They
are represented with a diamond symbol; we shall see examples of these in future
chapters.
