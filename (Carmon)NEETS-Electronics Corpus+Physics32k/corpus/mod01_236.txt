EFFECT OF CONDUCTOR LENGTH.â€”The length of a conductor is also a factor which
determines the resistance of a conductor. If the length of a conductor is increased, the amount of energy
given up increases. As free electrons move from atom to atom some energy is given off as heat. The
longer a conductor is, the more energy is lost to heat. The additional energy loss subtracts from the energy
being transferred through the conductor, resulting in a decrease in current flow for a given applied
voltage. A decrease in current flow indicates an increase in resistance, since voltage was held constant.
Therefore, if the length of a conductor is increased, the resistance increases. THE RESISTANCE OF A
CONDUCTOR IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS LENGTH.
