The major difference between the monopulse receiver and the conventional receiver is the
requirement for a dc error voltage output from the bearing and elevation channels. The range channel of a
monopulse receiver is sent to a conventional ranging circuit for presentation are on an indicator or for use
by a range-tracking circuit. However, since most monopulse radars are automatic tracking radars, the
outputs of the bearing and elevation channels must be converted to dc error signals for use by automatic
bearing and elevation tracking systems. The dc error voltages are applied to the antenna bearing and
elevation positioning servos. These servos reposition the antenna until the errors are nulled.
