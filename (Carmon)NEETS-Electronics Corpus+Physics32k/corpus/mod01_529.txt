Since the current obtained in the above calculations is a positive 2 amps, the assumed direction of
current was correct. To show what happens if the incorrect direction of current is assumed, the problem
will be solved as before, but with the opposite direction of current. The circuit is redrawn showing the
new direction of current and new polarities in figure 3-25. Starting at point A the loop equation is:
