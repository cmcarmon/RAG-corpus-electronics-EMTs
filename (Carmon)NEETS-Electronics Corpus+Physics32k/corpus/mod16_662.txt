If, for example, three cycles of the waveform were to be displayed on the screen, the sweep
frequency would be set to one-third the frequency of the input signal. If the input frequency were 12,000
hertz, the sweep frequency would be set at 4,000 hertz for a three-cycle scope presentation. For two
cycles, the sweep frequency would be set at 6,000 hertz. If a single cycle were desired, the setting would
be the same as the input frequency, 12,000 hertz.
