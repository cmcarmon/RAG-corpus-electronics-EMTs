Now suppose we have a sequence of parameters to send. We have exploited all of the sinusoid’s two
parameters. What we can do is modulate them for a limited time (say T seconds), and send two parameters
every T . This simple notion corresponds to how a modem works. Here, typed characters are encoded into
eight bits, and the individual bits are encoded into a sinusoid’s amplitude and frequency. We’ll learn how
this is done in subsequent modules, and more importantly, we’ll learn what the limits are on such digital
communication schemes.
