Cellular systems employed cells with a radius in the range of 5–18 km. The base station
usually transmitted at a power level of 35 W or less, and the mobile users transmitted at a power
level of about 3 W, so that signals did not propagate beyond immediately adjacent cells. By
making the cells smaller and reducing the radiated power, frequency reuse, bandwidth efﬁciency,
and the number of mobile users have been increased. With the advent of small and powerful
integrated circuits (which consume very little power and are relatively inexpensive), the cellular
radio concept has been extended to various types of personal communication services using
low-power hand-held sets (radio transmitter and receivers).
