give	up	on	you	the	other	night;	although	it’s	an	old	lamp,	you	still	believe	it	can	work	fine.
You	suspect	that	the	problem	is	in	the	switching	board.	Instead	of	just	letting	it	be	and
since	you’re	interested	in	how	it	works,	you	choose	to	study	its	components.
As	you	open	its	internal	system,	you	see	that	connected	to	some	sort	of	panel	are	2	wires;
one	wire	is	red,	the	other	is	black.	As	far	as	your	knowledge	in	circuits	can	tell	you,	the	2
wires	in	your	hands	are:	(1)	a	live	wire	or	the	wire	that	is	connected	to	a	switch,	and	(2)	a
neutral	wire	or	the	wire	that	carries	the	load.
As	the	universal	rule	in	circuit	engineering	goes,	red	is	the	color	that	indicates	a	live	wire,
black,	on	the	other	hand,	is	a	neutral	wire.	For	a	chance	to	know	why	your	lamp	gave	up
on	you	other	than	old	age,	checking	the	red	wire	would	be	a	good	start.
