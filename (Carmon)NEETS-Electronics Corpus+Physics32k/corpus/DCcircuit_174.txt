For instance, our previous circuit example with the 3 Ω lamp, we calculated current through
the circuit by dividing voltage by resistance (I=E/R). With an 18 volt battery, our circuit current
was 6 amps. Doubling the battery voltage to 36 volts resulted in a doubled current of 12 amps.
All of this makes sense, of course, so long as the lamp continues to provide exactly the same
amount of friction (resistance) to the ﬂow of electrons through it: 3 Ω.
