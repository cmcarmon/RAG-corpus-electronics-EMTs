For most digital applications the designs of the digital fiber optic receivers are similar. For low-data-
rate applications, PIN diodes and high impedance amplifiers are generally used. Receiver sensitivities are
maximized by using large load resistors in the photodiode circuit. For moderate-data-rate applications,
PIN diodes and either high impedance amplifiers with smaller load resistances or transimpedance
amplifiers are used. For high-data-rate applications, PINs or APDs are used with transimpedance
amplifiers. APDs are rarely used in low- or moderate-data-rate applications unless receivers with
extremely low sensitivities are required.
