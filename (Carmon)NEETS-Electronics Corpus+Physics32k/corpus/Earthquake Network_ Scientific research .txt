Earthquake warning systems are intended to rapidly detect earthquakes in order to alert the population in advance. When an earthquake is detected, a potentially large amount of people who will be affected in locations not too close to the epicenter can receive the warning several seconds (5 to 60) before damaging shaking occurs. This is possible since the warning can be delivered at a higher speed than the speed of the earthquake waves. The Earthquake Network project focuses on developing an earthquake warning system using smartphones rather than professional seismometers.
