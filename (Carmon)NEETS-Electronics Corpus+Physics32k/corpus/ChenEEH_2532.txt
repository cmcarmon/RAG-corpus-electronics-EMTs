geometry but have a narrow operating bandwidth (Ô¨Ålter be-
havior). On the other hand, the double-Y baluns may be used
for broadband design. They are based on a six-port double-Y
junction that consists of three balanced and three unbalanced
lines placed alternatively around the center of the junction.
The input and output lines are usually aligned along the same
axes, and the other four branch lines are short- or open-
circuited and perform in-phase and out-of-phase signal divid-
ing/combining procedures. This is very similar to the well-
known low-frequency electrical bridge transformer.
