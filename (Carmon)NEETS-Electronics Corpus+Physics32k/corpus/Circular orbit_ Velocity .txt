The relative velocity is constant:




v
=




G
M



r




=



μ

r






{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {GM\! \over {r}}}={\sqrt {\mu  \over {r}}}}

where:
G is the gravitational constant
M is the mass of both orbiting bodies (M1+M2), although in common practice, if the greater mass if significantly larger, the lesser mass is often neglected, with minimal change in the result.





μ
=
G
M




{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \mu =GM\,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
