Because or their low loss and wide bandwidth capabilities, optical ﬁbers have the potential for being used
wherever twisted wire pairs or coaxial cables are used as the transmission medium in a communication system.
If an engineer were interested in choosing a transmission medium for a given transmission objective, he or she
would tabulate the required and desired features of alternate technologies that may be available for use in the
applications. With  that  process  in  mind,  a  summary  of  the  attractive  features  and  the  advantages  of  optical
ﬁber transmission will be given. Some of these advantages include (a) low loss and high bandwidth; (b) small
size and bending radius; (c) nonconductive, nonradiative, and noninductive; (d) light weight; and (e) providing
natural growth capability.
