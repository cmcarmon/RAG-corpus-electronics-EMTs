The  system  noise  temperature,  T,  incorporates  contributions  to  the  noise  power  radiated  into  the  receiving
antenna  from  the  sky,  ground,  and  galaxy,  as  well  as  the  noise  temperature  due  to  circuit  and  propagation
losses,  and  the  noise  ﬁgure  of  the  receiver.  The  clear  sky  antenna  temperature  for  a  directive  earth  antenna
depends on the elevation angle since the antenna’s sidelobes will receive a small fraction of the thermal noise
power  radiated  by  the  earth  which  has  a  noise  temperature  Tearth »  290K. At  11  GHz,  the  clear  sky  antenna
noise temperature, Taclear , ranges from 5 to 10 K at zenith (el = 90(cid:176)) to more than 50 K at el = 5(cid:176) [Pratt and
Bostian, 1986].
