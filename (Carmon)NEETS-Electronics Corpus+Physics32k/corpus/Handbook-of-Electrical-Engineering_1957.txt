where the term a(n) is typically 1 for transversal least mean square (LMS) adaptive ﬁlters and of the form (1
– e(n)) for lattice LMS adaptive digital ﬁlters, and  f(n) = me(n)u(n) where m is a constant,  e(n) is the error,
and u(n) is the input. The use of look-ahead transforms the above recursion to
