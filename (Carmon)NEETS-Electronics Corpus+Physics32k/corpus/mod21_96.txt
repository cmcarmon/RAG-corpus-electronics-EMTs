The reactance type of capacitance measuring equipment makes use of the following principle: If an
ac voltage (usually 6.3 volts) at a fixed frequency is applied across a capacitor and resistor in series, the
voltage drop produced across the reactance of the capacitor by the resulting current flow is inversely
proportional to the capacitance. The voltage drop is used to actuate a meter that is calibrated in
capacitance values. This test equipment gives approximate values only and, like the ohmmeter, is used
mostly when portability and speed are more important than precision. The accuracy of the reactance-type
measurement is less for capacitors that have a high power factor. In capacitors with high power factors,
the losses incurred effectively place a certain amount of resistance in series with the capacitive reactance.
The effect of this resistance, when the capacitor is measured, is to cause a greater voltage drop across the
capacitor. This drop is not because of the reactance above, but is the result of the impedance, which of
