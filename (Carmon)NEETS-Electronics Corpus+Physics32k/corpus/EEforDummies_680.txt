In the decimal (base 10) system, if you want to 
express a number greater than 9, you need to 
use more than one digit. Each position, or place, 
in a decimal number represents a power of ten 
(100, 101, 102, 103, and so forth), and the value of 
the digit (0–9) sitting in that position is a multi-
plier for that power of ten. With powers of ten, 
the exponent (that tiny number raised up next 
to the 10) tells you how many times to multiply 
10 times itself, so 101 equals 10, 102 equals 10 × 
10 which is 100, 103 equals 10 × 10 × 10 which 
is 1,000, and so on. As for 100, it just equals 1 
because any number raised to the zeroth power 
equals 1. So the positions in a decimal number, 
starting from the rightmost position, represent 
1, 10, 100, 1,000, and so forth. These are also 
known as place values (ones or units, tens, hun-
dreds, thousands, and so forth). The digit (0–9) 
sitting in that position (or place) tells you how 
many ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, and so 
forth are contained in that decimal number.
For example, the number 9,452 can be written in 
expanded notation as
