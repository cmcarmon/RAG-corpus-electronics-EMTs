Edge-Triggered Flip-Flops
Two types of edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂops are predominantly used in modern designs. These are the D type and J-
K type. The D type is perhaps the most used because its circuitry generally takes up less real estate on an IC
chip and because most engineers consider it an easier device with which to design. An example of a positive
edge-triggered D ﬂip-ﬂop circuit is shown in Fig. 79.20. The reduced characteristic table illustrating the oper-
ation of this ﬂip-ﬂop is shown in Table 79.13.
