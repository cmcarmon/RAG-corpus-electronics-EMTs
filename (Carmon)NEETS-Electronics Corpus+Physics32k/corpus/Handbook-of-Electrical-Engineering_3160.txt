power switch is on, the inductor is connected to the dc source and the energy from the supply is stored in it.
When  the  device  is  off,  the  inductor  current  is  forced  to  ï¬‚ow  through  the  diode  and  the  load.  The  induced
voltage across the inductor is negative. The inductor adds to the source voltage to force the inductor current
into the load. The output voltage is given by
