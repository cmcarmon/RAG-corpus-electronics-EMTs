The chapter on information theory uses that term in a broad sense to describe mathematical models and
techniques for describing and simplifying both deterministic and random signals. These techniques can be used
for efÔ¨Åcient communication by removing inessential information and by showing how a receiver can distinguish
useful information from noise disturbances.
