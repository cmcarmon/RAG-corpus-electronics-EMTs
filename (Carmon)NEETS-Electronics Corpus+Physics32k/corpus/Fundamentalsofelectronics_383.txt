4.5 Fourier Series Approximation of Signals9
It is interesting to consider the sequence of signals that we obtain as we incorporate more terms into the
Fourier series approximation of the half-wave rectiﬁed sine wave (Example 4.2). Deﬁne sK (t) to be the
signal containing only those terms up to and including the Kth harmonic.
