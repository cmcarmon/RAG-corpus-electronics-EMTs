low-pass pulses
having clock rates below 3 GHz. Typical circuits in-
clude densely packed, multiple planes of metal traces
providing ï¬‚ow paths for the signals, dc power feeds,
and ground returns. Via pins provide electrical
connections between the planes. Circuit operation is
nominally not based on electromagnetic wave effects.
