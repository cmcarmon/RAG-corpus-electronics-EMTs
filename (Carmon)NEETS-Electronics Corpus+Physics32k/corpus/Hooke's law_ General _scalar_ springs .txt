Hooke's spring law usually applies to any elastic object, of arbitrary complexity, as long as both the deformation and the stress can be expressed by a single number that can be both positive and negative.
For example, when a block of rubber attached to two parallel plates is deformed by shearing, rather than stretching or compression, the shearing force F and the sideways displacement of the plates X obey Hooke's law (for small enough deformations).
Hooke's law also applies when a straight steel bar or concrete beam, supported at both ends, is bent by a weight F placed at some intermediate point. The displacement X in this case is the deviation of the beam, measured in the transversal direction, relative to its unloaded shape.
The law also applies when a stretched steel wire is twisted by pulling on a lever attached to one end. In this case the stress F can be taken as the force applied to the lever, and X as the distance traveled by it along its circular path. Or, equivalently, one can let F be the torque applied by the lever to the end of the wire, and X be the angle by which that end turns. In either case F is proportional to X (although the constant k is different in each case.)
