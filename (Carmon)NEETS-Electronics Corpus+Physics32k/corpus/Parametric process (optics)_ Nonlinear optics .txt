In a nonlinear media, the dielectric polarization P responds nonlinearly to the electric field E of the light. As a parametric process is in general coherent, many parametric nonlinear processes will depend on phase matching and will usually be polarization dependent.
Sample parametric nonlinear processes:
Second harmonic generation (SHG), or frequency doubling, generation of light with a doubled frequency (half the wavelength)
Third harmonic generation (THG), generation of light with a tripled frequency (one-third the wavelength) (usually done in two steps: SHG followed by SFG of original and frequency-doubled waves)
High harmonic generation (HHG), generation of light with frequencies much greater than the original (typically 100 to 1000 times greater)
Sum frequency generation (SFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the sum of two other frequencies (SHG is a special case of this)
Difference frequency generation (DFG), generation of light with a frequency that is the difference between two other frequencies
Optical parametric amplification (OPA), amplification of a signal input in the presence of a higher-frequency pump wave, at the same time generating an idler wave (can be considered as DFG)
Optical parametric oscillation (OPO), generation of a signal and idler wave using a parametric amplifier in a resonator (with no signal input)
Optical parametric generation (OPG), like parametric oscillation but without a resonator, using a very high gain instead
Spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the low gain regime
