Since practical values of C1 and RL ensure a more or less gradual decrease of the discharge voltage, 
a substantial charge remains on the capacitor at the time of the next half cycle of operation. As a result, no 
current can flow through the diode until the rising ac input voltage at the anode of the diode exceeds the 
voltage on the charge remaining on C1. The charge on C1 is the cathode potential of the diode. When the 
potential on the anode exceeds the potential on the cathode (the charge on C1), the diode again conducts, 
and C1 begins to charge to approximately the peak value of the applied voltage.
