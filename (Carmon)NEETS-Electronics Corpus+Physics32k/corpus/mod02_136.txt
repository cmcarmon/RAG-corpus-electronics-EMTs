 MUTUAL INDUCTANCEâ€”When two coils are located so that the flux from one coil cuts the 
turns of the other coil, the coils have mutual inductance. The amount of mutual inductance depends upon 
several factors: the relative position of the axes of the two coils; the permeability of the cores; the 
physical dimensions of the two coils; the number of turns in each coil, and the distance between the coils. 
The coefficient of coupling K specifies the amount of coupling between the coils. If all of the flux from 
one coil cuts all of the turns of the other coil, the coefficient of coupling K is 1 or unity. If none of the 
flux from one coil cuts the turns of the other coil, the coefficient of coupling is zero. The mutual 
inductance between two coils (L1 and L2) may be expressed mathematically as:
