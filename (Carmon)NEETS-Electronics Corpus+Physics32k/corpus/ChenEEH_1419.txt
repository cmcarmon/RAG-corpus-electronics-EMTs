The FPGA board used in Figure 3.5’s hardware platform has
been also used to implement an image interpolation engine by
Hudson et al. (1998). They used run-time reconﬁguration to
reduce the size of their interpolation engine by four times. To
reduce reconﬁguration time, they used a tool for incorporating
partial reconﬁguration into their design (Shirazi et al., 2000).
A further application has been developed for this FPGA
board by Singh et al. (1998) that involves accelerating Adobe
Photoshop computations in a software plug-in framework. As
different ﬁlters are selected in the application, a new design is
downloaded into the platform. The applications implemented
include a color to gray scale ﬁlter and 1-D and 2-D image
convolvers. Partial reconﬁguration is not performed when
switching between these image processing tasks. By using
the same method as Hudson et al. (1998), they reduced the
time required to reconﬁgure to a new image processing task.
The signiﬁcance of using this FPGA platform with a main-
stream application is that users do not need to know details
about the enabling technology to reap its beneﬁts. MacVicar
and Singh (1998) have also been able to accelerate the
rendering of Bezier curves, a core function in desktop publish-
ing applications.
