Solution to Exercise 5.33 (p. 178)
The delay is not computational delay here–the plot shows the ﬁrst output value is aligned with the ﬁlter’s ﬁrst
input–although in real systems this is an important consideration. Rather, the delay is due to the ﬁlter’s phase
shift: A phase-shifted sinusoid is equivalent to a time-delayed one: cos (2πf n − φ) = cos
.
All ﬁlters have phase shifts. This delay could be removed if the ﬁlter introduced no phase shift. Such ﬁlters
do not exist in analog form, but digital ones can be programmed, but not in real time. Doing so would
require the output to emerge before the input arrives!
Solution to Exercise 5.34 (p. 179)
We have p + q + 1 multiplications and p + q − 1 additions. Thus, the total number of arithmetic operations
equals 2 (p + q).
