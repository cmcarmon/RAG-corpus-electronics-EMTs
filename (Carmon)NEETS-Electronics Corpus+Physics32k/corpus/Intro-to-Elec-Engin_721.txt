The subject of ampliﬁer frequency response has to do with the behavior of an ampliﬁer as
a function of signal frequency. Circuit capacitances and effects internal to the transistors impose
limits on the frequency response of an ampliﬁer. Minimization of capacitive effects is a topic of
great interest in circuit design.
