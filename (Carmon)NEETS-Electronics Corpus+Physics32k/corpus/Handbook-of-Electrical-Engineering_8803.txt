With sets A and B, the expression A ﬁ B denotes the set of all functions that have the domain A and the
codomain B. Functions f ˛ A ﬁ B (traditionally denoted by f: A ﬁ B) are said to have the functionality A ﬁ B.
The collection of basic operations does not need to be minimal. It should, however, be rich enough so that
all other operations that one might wish to perform on the objects of the carrier set can be expressed exclusively
by these basic operations. The type Boolean, for example, consists of the set of Boolean values, Boolean = {true,
false}, with, e.g., the operations not, and, and or.
