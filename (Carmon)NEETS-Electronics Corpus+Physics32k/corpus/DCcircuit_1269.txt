If we were to move the potentiometer wiper in the ”down” direction, the capacitor voltage
would decrease rather than increase. Again, the capacitor will react to this change of voltage
by producing a current, but this time the current will be in the opposite direction. A decreas-
ing capacitor voltage requires that the charge differential between the capacitor’s plates be
reduced, and the only way that can happen is if the electrons reverse their direction of ﬂow, the
capacitor discharging rather than charging. In this condition, with electrons exiting the nega-
tive plate and entering the positive, the capacitor will act as a source, like a battery, releasing
its stored energy to the rest of the circuit.
