Thus, γ depends on frequency, and we express it in terms of real and imaginary parts as indicated. The
quantities V+ and V− are constants determined by the source and physical considerations. For example,
let the spatial origin be the middle of the transmission line model Figure 6.2. Because the circuit model
contains simple circuit elements, physically possible solutions for voltage amplitude cannot increase with
