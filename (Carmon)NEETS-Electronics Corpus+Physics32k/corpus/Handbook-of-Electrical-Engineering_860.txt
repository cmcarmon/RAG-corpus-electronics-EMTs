In Example 12.3 we showed that this system is stable but not asymptotically stable. This means that if we leave
it  alone  in  its  equilibrium  state,  it  will  remain  stationary,  but  if  we  jerk  on  the  mass  it  will  oscillate  forever.
There  is  no  damping  term  to  remove  the  energy,  so  the  energy  will  be  transferred  back  and  forth  between
potential energy in the spring and kinetic energy in the moving mass. A good approximation of such a harmonic
oscillator is a pendulum clock. The more expensive it is (i.e., the smaller the damping), the less often we have
to wind it (i.e., add energy).
