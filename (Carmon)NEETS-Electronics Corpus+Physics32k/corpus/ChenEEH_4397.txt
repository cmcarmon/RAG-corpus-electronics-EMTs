Zero steady-state error is possible for step inputs by appro-
priately including an exogenous model of the exosystem in the
feedback loop (Gonzalez and Antsaklis, 1991). If zero steady-
state error is not needed, then it will be necessary to make
the mappings from the four exogenous inputs to the tracking
error in equation 3.14 small. Three ways to determine the size
of a transfer function matrix are presented in the following
subsection.
To simplify the presentation, assume from now on that the
plant is square with p ¼ m. In addition, since the physical units
used for input and output signals may lead to errors of different
orders of magnitude, it is useful to normalize or scale the
magnitudes of the plant’s inputs and outputs. Procedures to
perform scaling of MIMO systems are presented in, for example,
Skogestad and Postlethwaite (1996). One approach is to nor-
malize the plant’s inputs and outputs so that the magnitude of
each error is less than one. An alternative and common choice
is to include the normalization in the frequency-dependent
weights to be introduced for control system design.
