Conﬁgurable computing, or reconﬁgurable computing, refers
to the use of conﬁgurable hardware for computing purposes.
The root of conﬁgurable computing can be traced back to the
early 1960s, when the idea of a ‘‘restructurable computer’’ was
ﬁrst proposed by Estrin et al. (1963). The recent interest in
conﬁgurable computing is mainly due to the rapid advance in
technology of ﬁeld-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), devices
containing a collection of programmable elements connected
together by a network that may also be programmable by users.
In short, FPGAs combine the ﬂexibility of software with a
performance approaching that of custom-developed hardware.
This chapter is intended to provide the reader with a ﬂavor
of conﬁgurable computing and its current and future trends.
Conﬁgurable computing covers a wide range of topics and is
rapidly growing, so our discussion will focus mainly on the
promising technology of run-time reconﬁguration. Useful
reviews of conﬁgurable computing and FPGAs
include
