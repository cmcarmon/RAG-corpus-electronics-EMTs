There are three basic classes of bullets:
Those designed for maximum accuracy at varying ranges.
Those designed to maximize damage to a target by penetrating as deeply as possible.
Those designed to avoid over-penetration of a target, by deforming to control the depth to which the bullet penetrates, which as a by-product, deals more damage inside the wound.
The third class may limit penetration by expanding or fragmenting.
