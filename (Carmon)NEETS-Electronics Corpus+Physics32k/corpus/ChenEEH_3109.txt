svs. Applying Faraday’s law to the rotor winding, the EMF is
multiplied by the slip for a given mutual ﬂux. The secondary
parameters are then r2 and sX2. The rotor reactance per phase
has been corrected by s due to the frequency change. Call the
effective turns ratio between the rotor and the stator n. Using
this value, ﬁrst reﬂect the rotor quantities to the stator. Having
done this, we connect the rotor and stator as is done in a
normal transformer equivalent circuit if it were not for the
frequency difference. The rotor current is then:
