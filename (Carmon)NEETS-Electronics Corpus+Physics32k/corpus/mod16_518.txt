Adjust the METER ZERO control for a zero meter indication. Plug the transistor to be tested into the
jack, or connect the test leads to the device. Set the PNP/NPN switch to correspond with the type of
transistor under test. Set the function switch to ICO and the RANGE switch to X0.1, X1.0, or X10, as
specified by the transistor data book for allowable leakage. Read leakage on the bottom scale and
multiply by the range setting figure as required.
