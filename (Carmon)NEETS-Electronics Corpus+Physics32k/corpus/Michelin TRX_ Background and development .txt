As passenger car performance increased during the 1970s, the need arose for improved tire capability. One of the possibilities was to reduce sidewall height, low sidewalls being common at the time on crossply racing tires, but not usual for the better-performing radial tire. The problem was that reducing sidewall height compromised tire comfort, in part due to the roadwheel rim profile used.
Michelin therefore decided to introduce the world's first tire and roadwheel system, where the two were designed together. This would enable both lower sidewall height, (for better roadholding) whilst retaining comfort due to better stress distribution within the tire, enabled by the redesigned wheel rim and tire bead.
The "TR" was for "tension r√©partie", since tire stresses were better balanced in the new design, whilst the "X" was a reference to previous Michelin products such as the famous "X" radial.
TRX tires thus require the use of wheels that were specially designed for them; standard tires do not fit TRX wheels and vice versa.
To avoid potentially dangerous confusion, Michelin used metric sizes for TRX roadwheels instead of the standard imperial wheel size (normally stated in inches).
