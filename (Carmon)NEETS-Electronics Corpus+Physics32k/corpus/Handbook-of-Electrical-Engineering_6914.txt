Strategies for minimizing intrinsic noise are (a) small bandwidth B, (b) small resistances R, (c) low temperature
T  (higher  temperatures  can  be  devastating),  (d)  low  voltage  and  currents  (CMOS  transistors),  (e)  modern
materials of high purity, (f) wrapped wire resistors (thermal noise is the same, but other noise will be less),
(g)  fewer  and  better  connections  (of  gold),  (h)  smaller  circuits  of  lower  power,  and  (i)  shunt  capacitors  to
reduce noise bandwidth. Greater purity of integrated circuit materials nowadays essentially reduces intrinsic
noise to thermal noise. Better design and materials are the keys to lower noise.
