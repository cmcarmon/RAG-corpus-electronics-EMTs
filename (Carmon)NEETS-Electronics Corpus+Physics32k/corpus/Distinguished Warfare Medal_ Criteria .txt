The intention of the Distinguished Warfare Medal involved recognizing - in the name of the Secretary of Defense - extraordinary achievement by members of the United States Armed Forces. Such achievement would have taken place after 11 September 2001, and need not have involved acts of valor. The criteria required that the qualifying achievement must have had a direct impact, through any domain, on combat or other military operations. These operations must have occurred under one of the following circumstances:
engaged in military operations against enemies of the United States
engaged in operations in conflict against an opposing foreign force
while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in operations with an opposing armed force where the United States is not a belligerent party
The achievement would need to be of such an outstanding or exceptional nature as to set the individual apart from peers serving in similar duties or situations. The medal was only to be awarded for single exemplary acts and would not have been awarded for sustained operational service. The Distinguished Warfare Medal could have been awarded posthumously.
Additional awards of the Distinguished Warfare Medal would be shown with oak leaf clusters for U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force awardees, and with 5/16 inch stars for U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard awardees.
Prior to cancellation, the service secretaries had not completed developing the criteria for the medal for each of their military services. The awarding criteria would have been included in the next Manual of Military Decorations and Awards.
