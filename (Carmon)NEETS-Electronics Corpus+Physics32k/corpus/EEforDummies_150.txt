Early experimenters believed that electric current was the flow of positive 
charges, so they described electric current as the flow of a positive charge 
from a positive terminal to a negative terminal. Much later, experimenters 
discovered electrons and determined that they flow from a negative terminal 
to a positive terminal. That original convention is still with us today â€” so 
the standard is to depict the direction of electric current in diagrams with an 
arrow that points opposite the direction of actual electron flow.
