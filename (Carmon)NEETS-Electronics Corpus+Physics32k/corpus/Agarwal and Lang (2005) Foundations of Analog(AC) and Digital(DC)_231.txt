In contrast to the continuous representation of analog signals, we can quan-
tize signals into discrete or lumped signal values. Value discretization forms
the basis of the digital abstraction, which yields a number of advantages
such as better noise immunity compared to an analog signal representation.
Although most physical signals are analog in nature, it is worth noting that
there are a few physical signals that are naturally quantized, and so would have
