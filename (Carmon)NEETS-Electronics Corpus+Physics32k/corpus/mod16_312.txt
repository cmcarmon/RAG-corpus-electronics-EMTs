indicated in the figure (away from you on the right-hand side and toward you on the left-hand side). If we
apply the right-hand motor rule, the direction of force is upward on the left-hand side and downward on
the right-hand side; therefore, the direction of motion of the coil and pointer is clockwise. If the current
were reversed in the wire, the direction of motion of the coil and pointer would be reversed. For a review
of the right-hand rule for motors, refer to NEETS, Module 5, Introduction to Generators and Motors.
