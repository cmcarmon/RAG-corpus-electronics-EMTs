The connection between the main memory and the processor that allows for the transfer of instructions and
operands is called the bus, as shown in Fig. 86.7. A bus consists of a set of address, data, and control lines. The
bus also allows program and data ﬁles to be transferred from their long-term location on magnetic disk storage
to the main memory. Long distance digital communication with other computers is also enabled by transfers
over the bus to the Communication Line Interface, as shown in the ﬁgure. The bus interconnects a number of
devices,  but  only  two  devices  (a  sender  and  a  receiver)  can  use  it  at  any  one  time.  Therefore,  some  control
circuitry is needed to manage the orderly use of the bus when a number of devices wish to use it.
