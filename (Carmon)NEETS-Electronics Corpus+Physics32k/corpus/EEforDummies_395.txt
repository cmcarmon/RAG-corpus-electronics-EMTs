Think about being in your car, stopped at a red light. When the light turns 
green, you get your car moving again, building speed until you reach the 
speed limit. It takes time to get to that speed, just like it takes time for 
a capacitor to get to a certain voltage level. If you switch on a battery 
across a resistor, however, the voltage across the resistor changes almost 
 instantaneously.
