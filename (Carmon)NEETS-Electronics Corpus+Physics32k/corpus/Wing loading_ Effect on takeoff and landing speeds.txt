Quantitatively, the lift force L on a wing of area A, traveling at speed v is given by

{\displaystyle \textstyle {\frac {L}{A}}={\tfrac {1}{2}}v^{2}\rho C_{L}}
,

where ρ is the density of air and CL is the lift coefficient. The latter is a dimensionless number of order unity which depends on the wing cross-sectional profile and the angle of attack. At take-off or in steady flight, neither climbing nor diving, the lift force and the weight are equal. With L/A = Mg/A =WSg, where M is the aircraft mass, WS = M/A the wing loading (in mass/area units, i.e. lb/ft2 or kg/m2, not force/area) and g the acceleration due to gravity, that equation gives the speed v through

.
As a consequence, aircraft with the same CL at takeoff under the same atmospheric conditions will have takeoff speeds proportional to

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {W_{S}}}}
. So if an aircraft's wing area is increased by 10% and nothing else changed, the takeoff speed will fall by about 5%. Likewise, if an aircraft designed to take off at 150 mph grows in weight during development by 40%, its takeoff speed increases to

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle 150{\sqrt {1.4}}}
= 177 mph.
Some flyers rely on their muscle power to gain speed for takeoff over land or water. Ground nesting and water birds have to be able to run or paddle at their takeoff speed and the same is so for a hang glider pilot, though he or she may get an assist from a downhill run. For all these a low WS is critical, whereas passerines and cliff dwelling birds can get airborne with higher wing loadings.
