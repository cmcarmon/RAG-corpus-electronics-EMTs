A typical fixed, spark-gap modulator circuit is shown in figure 2-38. Between trigger pulses the
spark gap is an open circuit. Current flows through the pulse transformer (T1), the pulse-forming network
(C1, C2, C3, C4, and L2), the diode (V1), and the inductor (L1) to the plate supply voltage (Eb). These
components form the charging circuit for the pulse-forming network.
