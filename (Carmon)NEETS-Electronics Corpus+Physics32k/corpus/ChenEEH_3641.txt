2 The term vocal tract is often used in imprecise ways by engineers. Sometimes
it is used to refer to the combination of all three cavities and even more often
to the entire speech production system. We will be careful in this chapter not to
use vocal tract when we mean speech production system, but, as is convention-
ally done in the literature, we will sometimes use the term vocal tract when we
actually mean vocal tract plus nasal tract. Whether vocal tract implicitly
includes the nasal tract will be clear from context, or explicitly stated.
