You may be familiar with piezoelectric guitar pickups, which use crystals to 
convert the mechanical vibrations generated by guitar strings into electrical 
signals, which are then amplified. And if you predate compact disc (CD) tech-
nology, you may be interested to know that phonograph needles relied on 
the piezoelectric effect to convert the ups and downs of a vinyl record track 
into electrical energy.
