Desoldering when necessary
At some point in your work with electronics, you’re bound to run into a 
cold solder joint, a backward‐oriented component, or some other solder-
ing mishap. To correct these mistakes, you have to remove the solder at 
the joint, and then apply new solder. You can use a desoldering pump (also 
known as a solder sucker and described shortly), a solder wick, or both to 
remove solder from the joint.
