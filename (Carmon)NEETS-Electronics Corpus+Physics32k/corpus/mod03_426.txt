SELECTIVE TRIPPING is used to cause the circuit breaker closest to the faulty circuit to trip,
isolating the faulty circuit without affecting other nonfaulty circuits. This is accomplished by using an
instantaneous circuit breaker close to the load, a short time delay circuit breaker at the next junction, and a
long time delay circuit breaker at the main junction box.
