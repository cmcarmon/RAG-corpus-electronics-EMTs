The desire for more extensive reusability of software than is
provided by OOP gave rise to a new concept in the late 1990s
termed software components, which are software modules
that are designed to be reused in different software applica-
tions (Szyperski, 1998). The term arises from the engineering
term component, referring to the pieces of equipment (prefer-
ably COTS equipment) that an engineer integrates together to
form a larger application. The idea is that software for large
applications could also be composed of individual software
modules that may be available as COTS. A software compo-
nent can be an object, a group of objects, or a non-object-
oriented software module. In this chapter, the term compo-
nent will be used to represent a generic, reusable module in a
control system that may be composed entirely of software,
hardware, or a combination of both. The term distributed
components is often used to describe components that are
linked via a communication network.
