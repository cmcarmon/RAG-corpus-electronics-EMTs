higher Vdd and partly at a lower Vdd, or similarly assume two
parallel units with different Vdds over which all the operations
can be distributed (see Figure 2.18). This duplication will
require some extra area, but on the entire chip this will involve
a (very) small overhead, and for energy reasons this can be
motivated. The high Vdd unit will clearly allow a higher speed.
In the simple example of Figure 2.18, 110 million instructions
need to be executed for the entire algorithm. Most instructions
can be executed in the low energy functional unit in a very
loose data path schedule (in total 1.0 s results in consuming
850 mJ). The same functionality, executed 25% faster, con-
sumes twice as much energy due to the requirement to execute
more on the high-speed functional unit (in total 0.75 s results
in 1600 mJ). The assignment of cycles to memory accesses and
to the data path is important for the overall energy consump-
tion. Obviously,
the contributions of both functions are
summed. This motivates a trade-off between the memory
system and the data path itself.
