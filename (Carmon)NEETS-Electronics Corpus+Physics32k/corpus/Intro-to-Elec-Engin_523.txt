Flip-ﬂops can be constructed using combinations of logic blocks. The realization of an SRFF
can be achieved from two NAND gates (plus two inverters), as shown in Figure 6.1.18. Because
of the feedback in this circuit it is not possible to simply write its truth table, as we can do for a
combinational circuit. However, a modiﬁed truth-table method can be used, in which we guess
