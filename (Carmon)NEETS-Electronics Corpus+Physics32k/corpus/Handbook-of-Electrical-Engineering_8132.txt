Interfacing
LCDs  can  be  organized  in  all  the  ways  available  to  competing  technologies,  e.g.,  LEDs  (see  Section  83.1),
including seven-segment, alphanumeric, and dot matrix. The LCD differs from LED displays, where each pixel
or  segment  must  be  a  separate  device,  because  the  LCD  segment  or  pixel  areas  are  deﬁned  by  transparent
electrodes separated from a common overlapping backplane by a single liquid crystal [Fig. 83.16(a)]. In a large
matrix array, it may take a signiﬁcant period to scan all pixels, and the simple addressing scheme of Fig. 83.16(b)
may lead to noticeable ﬂicker. The high off resistance of the MOSFETs of Fig. 83.16(c) can reduce this problem
by increasing the discharge time to hold the LCD on after the address pulse has gone. The MOSFETs in this
active matrix technology are implemented in practice in the form of polysilicon or hydrogenated amorphous
silicon (a-Si:H) thin ﬁlm transistors (TFT) [Shur, 1990; Braithwaite and Weaver, 1990].
