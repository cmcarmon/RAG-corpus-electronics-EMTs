DIACs are most commonly used as a triggering 
device for TRIACs. Each time the DIAC turns on, 
it allows current to flow through the TRIAC gate, 
thus turning the TRIAC on. The DIAC is used in 
 conjunction with the TRIAC to provide full-wave 
control of AC signals. Figure 33-18 shows a variable 
 full-wave phase-control circuit. Variable resistor R1 
and  capacitor C1 form a phase-shift network. When 
the  voltage across C1 reaches the breakover voltage of 
the DIAC, C1 partially discharges through the DIAC 
into the gate of the TRIAC. This discharge creates a 
pulse that  triggers the TRIAC into conduction. This 
circuit is useful for controlling lamps, heaters, and 
speeds of small electrical motors.
