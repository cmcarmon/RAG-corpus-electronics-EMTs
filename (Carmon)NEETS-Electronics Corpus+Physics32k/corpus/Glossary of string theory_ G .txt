G₂

The exceptional Lie algebra of rank 2 and dimension 14, or a G2 manifold with G₂ holonomy.
gaugino
A spin 1/2 supersymmetric partner of a gauge boson.
gh
Abbreviation for ghost; for example, Sgh is the ghost action.
ghost
A vector of negative norm.
GKO
Short for Goddard–Kent–Olive. The GKO construction, also called the coset construction, is a way of constructing unitary discrete series representations of the Virasoro algebra.
GL
A general linear group.
gluino

GMSB
Gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking.
goldstino

A massless spin 1/2 particle associated with spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry, analogous to the Goldstone boson.
GR
General relativity
graviton

A conjectural spin 2 massless particle responsible for gravity.
gravitino

A supersymmetric partner of the graviton.
Green
Named for Michael Green.
GS
Green–Schwarz formalism, a way of incorporating supersymmetry into string theory that is supersymmetric in 10-dimensional spacetime.
GSO
Short for Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joël Scherk, and David A. Olive, as in the GSO projection, a projection in superstring theory that eliminates tachyons.
GSW
The 2-volume work on superstring theory by Green, Schwarz, and Witten.
GUT
Grand unified theory, a hypothetical theory unifying the strong and electroweak forces.
GWS
Glashow–Weinberg–Salem theory of the electroweak force.
GZK
