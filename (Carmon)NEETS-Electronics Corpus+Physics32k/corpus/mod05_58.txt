From previous study, you know that all current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields. The 
magnetic field produced by current in the armature of a dc generator affects the flux pattern and distorts 
the main field. This distortion causes a shift in the neutral plane, which affects commutation. This change 
in the neutral plane and the reaction of the magnetic field is called ARMATURE REACTION.
