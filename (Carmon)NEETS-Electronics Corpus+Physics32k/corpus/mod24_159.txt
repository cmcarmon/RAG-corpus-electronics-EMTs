A large core size and a higher NA have several advantages. Light is launched into a multimode fiber
with more ease. The higher NA and the larger core size make it easier to make fiber connections. During
fiber splicing, core-to-core alignment becomes less critical. Another advantage is that multimode fibers
permit the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Single mode fibers typically must use laser diodes. LEDs
are cheaper, less complex, and last longer. LEDs are preferred for most applications.
