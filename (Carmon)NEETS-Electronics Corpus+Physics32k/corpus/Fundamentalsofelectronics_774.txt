Exercise 6.6
(Solution on p. 255.)
In addition to delay, the propagation attenuation encountered in satellite communication far exceeds
what occurs in ionospheric-mirror based communication. Calculate the attenuation incurred by
radiation going to the satellite (one-way loss) with that encountered by Marconi (total going up
and down). Note that the attenuation calculation in the ionospheric case, assuming the ionosphere
acts like a perfect mirror, is not a straightforward application of the propagation loss formula
(p. 201).
