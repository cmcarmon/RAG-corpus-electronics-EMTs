More generally, real-world function generators are seldom made from closed-loop feedback control systems
with 180 degrees of phase shift, because (1) it would be difﬁcult to get a broad range of frequencies and several
waveforms from such systems, (2) precise frequency selection would require expensive high-precision compo-
nents, and (3) it would be difﬁcult to maintain a constant frequency in such circuits in the face of changing
temperatures and power supply variations. Likewise, closed-loop feedback control systems with 180 degrees of
phase  shift  are  not  good  models  for  oscillating  biological  systems,  because  most  biological  systems  oscillate
because of nonlinear network properties.
