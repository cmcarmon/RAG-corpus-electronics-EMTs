OIL CAPACITORS are often used in high-power electronic equipment. An oil-filled capacitor is
nothing more than a paper capacitor that is immersed in oil. Since oil impregnated paper has a high
dielectric constant, it can be used in the production of capacitors having a high capacitance value. Many
capacitors will use oil with another dielectric material to prevent arcing between the plates. If arcing should
occur between the plates of an oil-filled capacitor, the oil will tend to reseal the hole caused by the arcing.
Such a capacitor is referred to as a SELF-HEALING capacitor.
