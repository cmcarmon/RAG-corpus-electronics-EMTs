The degree to which electrical shock can harm you depends on a lot of fac-
tors, including your age, your general health, the voltage, and the current. If 
you’re well over 50 or in poor health, you probably won’t stand up to injury 
as well as if you’re 14 and as healthy as an Olympic athlete. But no matter 
how young and healthy you may be, voltage and current can pack a wallop, 
so it’s important that you understand how much they can harm you.
