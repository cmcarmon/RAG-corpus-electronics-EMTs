With the advancement in MOS technology, ruggedized MOSFETs are replacing the conventional MOSFETs.
The  need  to  ruggedize  power  MOSFETs  is  related  to  device  reliability.  If  a  MOSFET  is  operating  within  its
speciﬁcation  range  at  all  times,  its  chances  for  failing  catastrophically  are  minimal.  However,  if  its  absolute
maximum rating is exceeded, failure probability increases dramatically. Under actual operating conditions, a
MOSFET may be subjected to transients — either externally from the power bus supplying the circuit or from
the  circuit  itself  due,  for  example,  to  inductive  kicks  going  beyond  the  absolute  maximum  ratings.  Such
conditions  are  likely  in  almost  every  application,  and  in  most  cases  are  beyond  a  designer’s  control.  Rugged
devices  are  made  to  be  more  tolerant  for  over-voltage  transients.  Ruggedness  is  the  ability  of  a  MOSFET  to
operate in an environment of dynamic electrical stresses, without activating any of the parasitic bipolar junction
transistors. The rugged device can withstand higher levels of diode recovery
