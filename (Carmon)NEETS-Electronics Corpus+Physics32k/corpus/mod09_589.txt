Look at view (B) as we continue. The input signal is a square-wave pulse type signal that varies in 
amplitude. Without an input signal, Q1 conducts and provides current through R1. This develops the 
output (collector to ground) potential which is assumed to be approximately −5 volts (VCC − ER1) for this 
discussion.
