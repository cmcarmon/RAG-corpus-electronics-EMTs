The  hybrid-pi  model  of  Fig.  28.11  forms  the  basis  for  the  small  signal  equivalent  circuit  of  the  common
emitter cell, which is given in Fig. 28.14(b). In this conÔ¨Åguration, the capacitance, Co, represents an effective
output port capacitance that accounts for both substrate loading of the collector port (if the BJT is a monolithic
device) and the net effective shunt capacitance associated with the load.
