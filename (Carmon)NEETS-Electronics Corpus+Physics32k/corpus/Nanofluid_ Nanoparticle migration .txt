In nanofluids, it is recognized that nanoparticles do not follow the fluid streamlines passively. In fact, there are some reasons that induce a slip velocity between the nanoparticles and the base fluid. Movements of nanoparticles has significant impact on rheological and thermophysical properties of the nanofluids. Therefore, investigating the nanoparticles motion is critical for evaluating the performance of nanoparticles inclusion to the base fluid as a heat transfer medium. Since the nanoparticles are very small ( 100 nm), Brownian and thermophoretic diffusivities are the main slip mechanisms in nanofluids, as Buongiorno declared. Brownian diffusion is due to random drifting of suspended nanoparticles in the base fluid which originates from continuous collisions among the nanoparticles and liquid molecules. Thermophoresis induces nanoparticle migration from warmer to colder region (in opposite direction of the temperature gradient), making a non-uniform nanoparticle volume fraction distribution.
In fact, theoretical models estimated that nanoparticles are non-homogeneously distributed. The level of non-uniformity is completely depend on thermal boundary conditions, the nanoparticle size, shape, and material. Rigorous readers encouraged to find more interesting results in open literature.
