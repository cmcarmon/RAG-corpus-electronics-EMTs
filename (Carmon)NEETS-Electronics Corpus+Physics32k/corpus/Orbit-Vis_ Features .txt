The program features two major parts - the input and numerical display window, in which the user can enter a desired Apogee and Perigee and press the 'Launch!' button to begin the simulation, and which displays the numerical properties of the orbit in real time, and also the visual display, which consists of a sizeable window displaying the Earth and the orbiting object to scale. Also featured is a control panel which allows the user to manipulate the display window in real time.
The graphical display features double-buffering and the ability to update the inputs while the simulation is running, along with a moveable viewpoint and the ability to pause the simulation.
Version 2.0 also fixed various bugs and cleared up the interface.
