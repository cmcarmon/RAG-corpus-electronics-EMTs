The sample average approach was Ô¨Årst applied for enhancing speech signals by Porter and Boll in 1984 [Boll,
1992]. They, however, considered a simpler situation in which the noise true pdf was assumed known. In this
case, enhanced signals with residual noise characterized as being a blend of wideband noise and musical noise
were obtained. The balance between the two types of residual noise depended on the functional of the clean
signal which was estimated.
