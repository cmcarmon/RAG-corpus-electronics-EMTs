Radar is constructed from the words radio detection and
ranging. The early purpose of a radar was to detect the presence
of a target and measure its range by transmitting radio waves.
Modern radars not only detect target and measure distances,
but they also have the capability of locating, imaging, and
identifying targets. A typical radar consists of a transmitter, an
antenna, a receiver, a signal processor, and a display.
