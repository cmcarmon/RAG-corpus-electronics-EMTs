Thermal Noise as Gaussian White Noise
Brown observed in 1828 that pollen and dust particles moved randomly when suspended in liquid. In 1906,
Einstein analyzed such motion based on the random walk model. Perrin conﬁrmed in 1908 that the thermal
activity of molecules in a liquid caused irregular bombardment of the much larger particles. It was predicted
that  charges  bound  to  thermally  vibrating  molecules  would  generate  electromotive  force  (emf)  at  the  open
terminals of a conductor, and that this placed a limit on the sensitivity of galvanometers. Thermal noise (also
called Johnson noise) was ﬁrst observed by J. B. Johnson at Bell Laboratories in 1927. Figure 73.5 displays white
noise as seen in the laboratory on an oscilloscope.
