Figure 35-1 shows some typical photocells. The 
light-sensitive material is deposited on an insulating 
substrate of glass or ceramic in an S-shape to allow 
greater contact length. The photocell is more sensi-
tive to light than any other device. The resistance can 
vary from several hundred ohms to several hundred 
million ohms. The photocell is useful for low-light 
 applications. It can withstand high operating voltages 
of 200 to 300 volts, with a low-power consumption of 
up to 300 milliwatts. A disadvantage of the photocell is 
its slow response to light change.
