Figure 2-3 is a simple picture of an E field detaching itself from an antenna. (The H field will not be 
considered, although it is present.) In view A the voltage is maximum and the electric field has maximum 
intensity. The lines of force begin at the end of the antenna that is positively charged and extend to the 
end of the antenna that is negatively charged. Note that the outer E lines are stretched away from the inner 
lines. This is because of the repelling force that takes place between lines of force in the same direction. 
As the voltage drops (view B), the separated charges come together, and the ends of the lines move 
toward the center of the antenna. But, since lines of force in the same direction repel each other, the 
centers of the lines are still being held out.
