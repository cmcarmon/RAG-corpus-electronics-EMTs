The goal is now to design a system that produces an estimated state ˆx(t) for Eq. (100.156) while rejecting
the inﬂuence of the signals v(t) and w(t). To do this, we need the further assumptions that the system’s initial
state is guessed to be x(t0) = x0 and that this guess is uncorrelated with the plant and measurement noise:
