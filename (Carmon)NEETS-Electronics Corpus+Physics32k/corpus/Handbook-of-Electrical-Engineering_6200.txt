adjacent channel interference may occur. To improve the high-frequency performance of transmission and to
compensate for the high-frequency roll-off of many consumer receivers, FCC rules require that stations boost
the  high-frequency  amplitude  of  transmitted  audio  using  preemphasis  techniques.  In  addition  stations  may
also  use  multiplexing  to  transmit  stereophonic  programming.  The  FCC  adopted  Motorolaâ€™s  C-QUAM  com-
patible quadrature amplitude modulation in 1994. Approximately 700 AM stations transmit in stereo.
