Several different forms of spacetime jutsu (technique) appear in the Naruto Shippuden manga. Those include teleporting one's self, teleporting objects or humans, and adjusting time to teleport. Those techniques have names such as Kamui for teleporting objects/humans, Summoning when teleporting an animal to one's location, and Flying Thunder God when teleporting one self to where a teleporting seal is located (mainly used by the "Yellow Flash").
