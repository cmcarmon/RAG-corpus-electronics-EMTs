In a system consisting of a collection of  n identical components with a probability p that a component is
defective, the probability of Ô¨Ånding r defects out of n is given by the Pr in Eq. (110.10). If p is the probability
of success of one component and if at least r of them must be good for system success, then the system reliability
(probability of system success) is given by
