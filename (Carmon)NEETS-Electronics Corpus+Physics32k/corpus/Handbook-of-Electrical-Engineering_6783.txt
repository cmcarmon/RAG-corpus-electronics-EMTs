The CCS7 Network
A general architecture for a regional signaling network is shown in Fig. 72.13. The network is made up of signal
transfer  points  (STPs),  which  are  very  reliable,  high-capacity  packet  switches  that  route  signaling  messages
between network access nodes such as switches and SCPs. To perform these routing functions, the STPs each
possess a large routing database containing translation data.
