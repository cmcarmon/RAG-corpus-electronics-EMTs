Ouillon and Sornette have developed a pure statistical physics model of earthquake interaction and triggering, aiming at giving more flesh to the purely empirical ETAS linear model. The basic assumption of this "Multifractal stress activated" model is that, at any place and time, the local failure rate depends exponentially on the applied stress. The second key ingredient is to recognize that, In the Earth crust, the local stress field is the sum of the large scale, far-field stress due to plate motion, plus all stress fluctuations due to past earthquakes. As elastic stresses add up, the exponentiation thus makes this model nonlinear. Solving it analytically allowed them to predict that each event triggers some aftershocks with a rate decaying in time according to the Omori law, i.e. as 1/tp, but with a special twist that had not been recognized heretofore. The unique prediction of the MSA model is that the exponent p is not constant (close to 1) but increases linearly with the magnitude of the mainshock. Statistical analyses of various catalogs (California, Japan, Taiwan, Harvard CMT) have been carried out to test this prediction, which confirmed it using different statistical techniques (stacks to improve signal to noise ratio, specifically devised wavelets for a multiscale analysis, extreme magnitude distributions, etc.). This result thus shows that small events may trigger a smaller number of aftershocks than large ones, but that their cumulative effect may be more long-lasting in the Earth crust. A new technique has also recently introduced, called the barycentric fixed mass method, to improve considerably the estimation of multifractal structures of spatio-temporal seismicity expected from the MSA model.
