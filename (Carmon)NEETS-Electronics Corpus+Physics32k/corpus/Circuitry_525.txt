Address bus (A0 to A15) 
 
The address bus provides a highway for addresses 
that links with all of the system components (such 
as random access memory, read-only memory, and 
input/output  devices).  In  a  system  with  a  16-bit 
address bus, there are sixteen address lines, labelled 
A0  (the  least  significant  bit)  to  A15  (the  most 
significant  bit).  In  a  system  with  a  32-bit  address 
bus there are 32 address lines, labelled A0 to A31, 
and so on.
