phase difference between the two windings is obtained by connecting the auxiliary winding in series with
a capacitor and starting switch. When the motor is first energized, the starting switch is closed. This
places the capacitor in series with the auxiliary winding. The capacitor is of such value that the auxiliary
circuit is effectively a resistive-capacitive circuit (referred to as capacitive reactance and expressed as
XC). In this circuit the current leads the line voltage by about 45ยบ  (because X C about equals R). The main
winding has enough resistance-inductance (referred to as inductive reactance and expressed as XL) to
cause the current to lag the line voltage by about 45ยบ  (because X
