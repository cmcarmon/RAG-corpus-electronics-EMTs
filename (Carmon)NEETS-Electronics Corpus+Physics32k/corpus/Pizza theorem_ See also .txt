Other mathematical results related to pizza slicing involve the lazy caterer's sequence, a sequence of integers that counts the maximum number of pieces of pizza that one can obtain by a given number of straight slices, and the ham sandwich theorem, a result about slicing three-dimensional objects whose two-dimensional version implies that any pizza, no matter how misshapen, can have its area and its crust length simultaneously bisected by a single carefully chosen straight-line cut, and three dimensional version implies a plane cut exists that equally shares base, tomato and cheese.
