Many industrial loads have lagging power factors. Electric utilities may assess penalties for
the delivery of reactive power when the power factor of the customerâ€™s load is below a minimum
level, such as 90%. Capacitors are often used in conjunction with such loads for the purpose
of power factor correction or improvement. An appropriate capacitor connected in parallel with
an inductive load cancels out the reactive power and the combined load may have unity power
factor, thereby minimizing the current drawn from the source. For problems and examples on this
subject, one may also refer to Sections 3.1 and 4.2.
