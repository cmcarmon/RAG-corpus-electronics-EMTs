JFET Biasing
Voltage Source Biasing
Now we will consider the biasing of JFETs for operation in the active region. The
simplest  biasing  method  is  shown  in  Fig.  24.7,  in  which  a  voltage  source VGG  is
used to provide the quiescent gate-to-source bias voltage VGSQ . In the active region
the transfer equation for the JFET has been given as IDS = IDSS[1 – (VGS / VP)]2, so
for a quiescent drain current of IDSQ the corresponding gate voltage will be given
by VGSQ = VP (1 – 
. For a Q point in the middle of the active region,
we have that IDSQ = IDSS/2, so VGSQ = VP (1 –
