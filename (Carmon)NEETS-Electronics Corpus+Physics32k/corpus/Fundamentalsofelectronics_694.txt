(b) How fast would you need to sample for the amplitude estimate to be within 5% of the true value?
(c) Another issue in sampling is the inherent amplitude quantization produced by A/D converters. Assume
the maximum voltage allowed by the converter is Vmax volts and that it quantizes amplitudes to
b bits. We can express the quantized sample Q (s (nTs)) as s (nTs) +  (t), where  (t) represents
the quantization error at the nth sample. Assuming the converter rounds, how large is maximum
quantization error?
