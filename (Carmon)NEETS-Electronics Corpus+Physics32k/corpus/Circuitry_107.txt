Capacitor markings 
 
The  vast  majority  of  capacitors  employ  written 
markings  which  indicate  their  values,  working 
voltages, and tolerance. The most usual method of 
marking resin dipped polyester (and other) types of 
capacitor involves quoting the value (ÂµF, nF or pF), 
the  tolerance  (often  either  10%  or  20%),  and  the 
working  voltage  (often  using  _  and  ~  to  indicate 
d.c.  and  a.c.  respectively).  Several  manufacturers 
use two separate lines for their capacitor markings 
and these have the following meanings:
