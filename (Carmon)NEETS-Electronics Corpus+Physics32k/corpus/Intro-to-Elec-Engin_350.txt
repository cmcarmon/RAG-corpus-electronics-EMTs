When the load power factor is unity, corresponding to a purely resistive load, both wattmeters
will indicate the same wattage. In fact, both of them should read positive; if one of the wattmeters
has a below-zero indication in the laboratory, an upscale deï¬‚ection can be obtained by simply
reversing the leads of either the current or the potential coil of the wattmeter. The sum of the
wattmeter readings gives the total power absorbed by the load.
