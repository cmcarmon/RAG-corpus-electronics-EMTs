SCARA Conﬁguration
The SCARA (Selectively Compliant Assembly Robot Arm) conﬁguration consists of two revolute joints and a
linear  joint  (RRP),  as  shown  in  Fig. 101.9.  This  conﬁguration  is  signiﬁcantly  different  from  the  spherical
degrees of freedom
conﬁguration, since the axes for all joints are always vertical. In addition to the ﬁrst three 
(DOF), the SCARA robot will often include an additional rotation about the last vertical link to aid in orientation
of parts. The work envelope of the SCARA robot is illustrated in Fig. 101.10. The SCARA conﬁguration is the
newest  of  the  conﬁgurations  discussed  here,  and  was  developed  by  Professor  Hiroshi  Makino  of Yamanashi
University, Japan.
