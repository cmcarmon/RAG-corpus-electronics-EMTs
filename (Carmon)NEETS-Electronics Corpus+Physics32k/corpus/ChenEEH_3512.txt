The independent variable of a signal can be either continu-
ous or discrete, depending on the set of values for which the
function is deﬁned. In the ﬁrst case, the signal is continuous-
time, and the function is deﬁned over a continuum of values of
the independent variable; in the second case, the signal is
discrete-time, and the function is deﬁned over a countable
set of values of the independent variable.
