A mathematical model describes the behavior of a physical system or device in terms of a set of equations,
together with a schematic diagram of the device containing the symbols of its elements, their connections, and
numerical values. As an example, a physical electrical system can be represented graphically by a network which
includes resistors, inductors, and capacitors, etc. as its components. Such an illustration, together with a set of
linear differential equations, is referred to as a model system.
