The large ”Helipot” unit is a laboratory potentiometer designed for quick and easy connec-
tion to a circuit. The unit in the lower-left corner of the photograph is the same type of poten-
tiometer, just without a case or 10-turn counting dial. Both of these potentiometers are preci-
sion units, using multi-turn helical-track resistance strips and wiper mechanisms for making
small adjustments. The unit on the lower-right is a panel-mount potentiometer, designed for
rough service in industrial applications.
