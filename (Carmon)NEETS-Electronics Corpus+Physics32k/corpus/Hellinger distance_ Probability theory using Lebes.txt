To define the Hellinger distance in terms of elementary probability theory, we take λ to be Lebesgue measure, so that dP / dλ and dQ / dλ are simply probability density functions. If we denote the densities as f and g, respectively, the squared Hellinger distance can be expressed as a standard calculus integral

where the second form can be obtained by expanding the square and using the fact that the integral of a probability density over its domain equals 1.
The Hellinger distance H(P, Q) satisfies the property (derivable from the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality)
