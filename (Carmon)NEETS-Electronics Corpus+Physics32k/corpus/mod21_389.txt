There are two methods of measuring high speeds. The first method is to obtain a single stationary 
image of the rotating object at a subharmonic speed relationship and to record that value as A. Then 
obtain a second single stationary image at the next lower subharmonic speed relationship, and record this 
value as B. The unknown speed may then be computed from the following formula:
