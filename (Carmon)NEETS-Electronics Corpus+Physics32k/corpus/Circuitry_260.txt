Example 5.6 
 
An  NPN  transistor  is  to  be  used  in  a  regulator 
circuit in which a collector current of 1.5 A is to be 
controlled by a base current of 50 mA. What value 
of hFE  will be required?  
If  the  device  is  to  be  operated  with  VCE  = 6 V, 
 
which transistor selected from Table 5.10 would be 
appropriate for this application and why? 
 
Solution 
 
The required current gain can be found from: 
 
hFE = IC /IB = 1.5 A / 50 mA = 1.5 / 0.05 = 30 
 
The most appropriate device would be the BD131. 
The  only  other  device  capable  of  operating  at  a 
collector current of 1.5 A would be a 2N3055.  
  The collector power dissipation will be given by:  
 
PC = IC × VCE = 1.5 A × 6 V = 9 W
However, the 2N3055 is rated at 115 W maximum 
total  power  dissipation  and  this  is  more  than  ten 
times the power required.
