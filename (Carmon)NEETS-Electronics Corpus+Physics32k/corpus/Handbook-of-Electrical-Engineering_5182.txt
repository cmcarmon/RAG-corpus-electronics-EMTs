Although the scheme illustrated in Fig. 58.4 refers to vibration control (or damping) in structures, judicious
choice  of  subsystems  and  materials  will  permit  adaptive  control  over  other  structural  aspects  also,  namely,
strain, bending moment, and redistribution of load path in response to failures.
