Results are shown in Fig. 64.8(d). Observe that the Y–D winding connections had no impact on the calculations.
Another detail deserves mention. Although the real and reactive parts of the short-circuit impedances (–Z12,
–Z23, ––Z31) will always be positive, this is not true for the transformer impedances (––Z1, ––Z2, ––Z3). One or
more of these can be, and frequently is, negative for actual short-circuit data. Negative values underscore that
the circuit of Fig. 64.7 is a port equivalent circuit, producing correct values at the winding terminals.
