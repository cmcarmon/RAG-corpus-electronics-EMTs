It employs the principle of feedback .. the incoming water pushes the buoy upwards , outgoing water lowers it, adjusting "conic needle" to let pass the same amount of water that enters into the container, this way.. "inked needle" records, on the drum's sheet, the amount of water flowing through the "conic hole" at every moment -in mm of rainfall per square-meter

Jardi's pluviometer consists of a drum that rotates at constant speed. The drum moves a graduated sheet of cardboard (the cardboard sheet is usually for one day) that records the time at the abscissa while the y axis indicates the height of rainfall in mm. A pen moves vertically as the cardboard moves below it. The pen is driven by a buoy, marking the paper with the instantaneous rainfall rate over a period of time.
When rain falls, it is collected by an external funnel. It passes into the cylindrical reservoir and raises the buoy... that raises the pen along the vertical axis, marking the cardboard accordingly. If the rainfall does not vary, the water level in the container remains constant, and the pen's mark is approximately a horizontal line, proportional to the amount of water that is falling. If the rain is heavy enough, it can exceed the device's capacity. At that level, the regulating hole is uncovered, discarding the excess water. If the rain decreases, the buoy drops at the same speed -as the cylindrical reservoir empties.
The pluviometer recorded precipitation in Barcelona for 95 years and in places such as Hong-Kong).
To measure the average intensity of rainfall in a certain interval of time, the Pluviometer of intensities uses the formula:

{\textstyle {\frac {h(\Delta {\mathit {T}})}{\Delta {\mathit {T}}}}={\mathit {i}}\,}

Intensity varies over time. The pluviometer records instantaneous rain intensity (as its name defines):
