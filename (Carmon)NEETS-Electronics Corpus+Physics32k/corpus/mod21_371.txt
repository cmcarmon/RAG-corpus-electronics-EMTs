True calorimetric measurements contain appreciable error, because of nonuniformity of flow rate, air 
bubbles, flow-rate measurement inaccuracies, and temperature rise. Flow regulators, bubble traps, and 
good thermal insulation are required to eliminate the majority of these errors. Substitution methods do not 
involve direct heat dissipation measurement of moving fluid. Greater accuracy is obtained because known 
low-frequency power is substituted for the unknown rf power, with all other measurement parameters 
remaining constant. The accuracy depends on the exactness of the low-frequency power determination 
and the degree to which factors remain fixed during the substitution of one type of power with another.
