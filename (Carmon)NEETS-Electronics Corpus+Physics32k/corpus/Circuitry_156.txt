The capacitor voltage will rise to approximately 
63%  of  the  supply  voltage,  Vs, in  a  time  interval 
equal to the time constant.  
  At  the  end  of  the  next  interval  of  time  equal  to 
the time constant (i.e. after an elapsed time equal to 
2CR) the  voltage  will  have  risen  by  63%  of  the 
remainder, and so on. In theory, the capacitor will 
never  become  fully  charged.  However,  after  a 
period of time equal to 5CR, the capacitor voltage 
will  to  all  intents  and  purposes  be  equal  to  the 
supply voltage.  At  this point  the capacitor voltage 
will have risen to 99.3% of its final value and  we 
can consider it to be fully charged.
