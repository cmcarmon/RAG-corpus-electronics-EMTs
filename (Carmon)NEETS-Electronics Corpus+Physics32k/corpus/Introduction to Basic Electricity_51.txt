Differential	resistance	–	it	is	the	resistance	derivative	of	voltage	in	light
with	the	electric	current;	also	referred	to	as	incremental	resistance,	small
signal	resistance,	or		dynamic	resistance,	its	concept	is	responsible	for
oscillators	and	amplifiers
Static	resistance	–	it	is	the	resistance	that	corresponds	to	the	typical
definition	of	resistance;	it	is	also	called	chordal	resistance	or	DC	resistance
