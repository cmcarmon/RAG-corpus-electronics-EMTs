Leakage current is the direct current that passes through a capacitor when a correctly polarized dc voltage
is  applied  to  its  terminals.  It  is  proportional  to  temperature,  becoming  increasingly  important  at  elevated
ambient temperatures. Leakage current decreases slowly after voltage is applied, reaching steady-state condi-
tions in about 10 min.
