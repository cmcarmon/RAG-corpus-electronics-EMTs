One accepted theory proposes the existence of light as tiny packets of energy called PHOTONS.
Photons can contain various quantities of energy. The amount depends upon the color of the light
involved. Should a photon of sufficient energy collide with an orbital electron, the electron will absorb the
photonâ€™s energy, as shown in figure 1-2. The electron, which now has a greater than normal amount of
energy, will jump to a new orbit farther from the nucleus. The first new orbit to which the electron can
jump has a radius four times as large as the radius of the original orbit. Had the electron received a greater
amount of energy, the next possible orbit to which it could jump would have a radius nine times the
original. Thus, each orbit may be considered to represent one of a large number of energy levels that the
electron may attain. It must be emphasized that the electron cannot jump to just any orbit. The electron
will remain in its lowest orbit until a sufficient amount of energy is available, at which time the electron
will accept the energy and jump to one of a series of permissible orbits. An electron cannot exist in the
space between energy levels. This indicates that the electron will not accept a photon of energy unless it
contains enough energy to elevate itself to one of the higher energy levels. Heat energy and collisions
with other particles can also cause the electron to jump orbits.
