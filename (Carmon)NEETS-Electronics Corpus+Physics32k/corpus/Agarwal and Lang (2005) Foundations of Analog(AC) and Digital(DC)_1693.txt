A close look at Equations 12.21 and 12.22 shows that, for all choices of
initial condition, iL and vC are sinusoidal functions that are a quarter cycle out
of phase with each other. The initial conditions affect only their amplitudes and
their common absolute phase. Therefore, we can illustrate the behavior of the
circuit without loss of understanding by considering the special case of
