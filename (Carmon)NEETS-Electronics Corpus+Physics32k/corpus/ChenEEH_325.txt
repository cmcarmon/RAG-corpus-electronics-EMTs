disappears near the drain. This condition is called pinch-off,
and the channel conductance becomes zero. As shown in
Figure 3.9, VD, sat increases with gate bias. This results because
a larger gate bias requires a larger drain bias to reduce the
voltage drop across the oxide near the drain end. As given in
equation 3.22, VD, sat increases linearly with VGS.
