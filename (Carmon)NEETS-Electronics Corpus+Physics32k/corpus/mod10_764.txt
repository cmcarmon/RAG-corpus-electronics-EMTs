When a unidirectional radiation pattern is desired, it can be obtained by the use of a corner reflector 
with a half-wave dipole. A CORNER-REFLECTOR ANTENNA is a half-wave radiator with a reflector. 
The reflector consists of two flat metal surfaces meeting at an angle immediately behind the radiator. In 
other words, the radiator is set in the plane of a line bisecting the corner angle formed by the reflector
