Suppose that we are interested in solving for the current iL. As before, we
can use the node method to obtain an equation involving the unknown node
voltage vL, and then use the constituent relation for an inductor from Equa-
tion 9.28 to substitute for vL in terms of the variable of interest to us, namely
iL. For variety, however, we will derive the same differential equation in iL by
applying KVL:
