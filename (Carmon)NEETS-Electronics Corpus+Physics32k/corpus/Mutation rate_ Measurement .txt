An organism's mutation rates can be measured by a number of techniques.
One way to measure the mutation rate is by the fluctuation test, also known as the Luria–Delbrück experiment. This experiment exhibits in bacteria mutations occur in the absence of selection instead of the presence of selection.
This is very important to mutation rates because it proves experimentally mutations can occur without selection being a component. Therefore, mutations occur at random in bacteria (and other organisms.)
