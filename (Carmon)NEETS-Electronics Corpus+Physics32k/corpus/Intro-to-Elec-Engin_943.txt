*11.2.7 Consider the magnetic circuit shown in Figure
P11.2.7. Assume the relative permeability of the
magnetic material to be 1000 and the cross-sec-
tional area to be the same throughout. Determine
the current needed in the coil to produce a ï¬‚ux
density of 1 T in the center limb, if the excitation
coil has 500 turns.
