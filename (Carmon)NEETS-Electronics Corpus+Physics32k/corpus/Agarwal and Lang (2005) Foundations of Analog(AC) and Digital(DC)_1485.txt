Now suppose we did not use a clock. As we saw previously, RC delays
cause signals to go through invalid signal levels for a finite period of time when
they transition from one value to another. Without some mechanism such as a
clock and an associated discipline, there would be no way in which the second
digital circuit could tell when it was receiving a valid signal. As we shall see in a
later chapter, telling apart a valid signal from a transitional value is particularly
difficult when signals display oscillatory or ringing behavior.
