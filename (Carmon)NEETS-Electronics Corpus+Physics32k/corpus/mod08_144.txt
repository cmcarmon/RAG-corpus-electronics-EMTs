C1 is the input signal coupling capacitor and couples the input signal to the base of Q1. R1 develops 
the input signal. R2 and R3 develop the output signals. R2 and R3 are equal resistances to provide equal 
amplitude output signals. C2 and C3 couple the output signals to the next stage. R4 is used to provide 
proper bias for the base of Q1.
