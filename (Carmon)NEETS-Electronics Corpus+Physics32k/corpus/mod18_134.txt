When radio-frequency energy transmitted from a fixed point continuously strikes an object that is
either moving toward or away from the source of the energy, the frequency of the reflected energy is
changed. This shift in frequency is known as the DOPPLER EFFECT. The difference in frequency
between the transmitted and reflected energy indicates both the presence and the speed of a moving
target.
