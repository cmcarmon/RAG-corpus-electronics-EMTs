Stator-impedance starting may be employed if the starting-torque requirement is not severe.
Series resistances (or impedances) are inserted in the lines to limit the starting current. These
resistances are short-circuited out when the motor gains speed. This method has the obvious
disadvantage of inefﬁciency caused by the extra losses in the external resistances.
