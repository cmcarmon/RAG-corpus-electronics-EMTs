In this chapter, I show you various ways to connect 
electronic components together into circuits that 
push electrons around at your command. First, I 
describe how to make flexible, temporary circuits 
using plug‐and‐play solderless breadboards, which 
provide the ideal platform for testing and tweaking 
your designs. Next, I give you the lowdown on how 
to safely fuse components together using a molten 
substance called solder (what fun!). Finally, I outline 
your options for creating permanent circuits using an 
assortment of today’s most popular circuit boards.
