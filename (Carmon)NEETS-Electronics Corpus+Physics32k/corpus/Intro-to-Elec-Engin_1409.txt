Antennas do not radiate power equally in all directions in space. The radiation intensity
pattern describes the power intensity (which is power per unit solid angle, expressed in units of
watts per steradian) in any spatial direction. Conceptually it is convenient to deﬁne an isotropic
antenna as a lossless antenna that radiates its power uniformly in all directions. Although an
isotropic antenna cannot be realized in practice, it serves as a reference for comparison with real
antennas. The radiation intensity for such an antenna, with input power P, is a constant in any
direction, given by P /4π. The power gain G of a realistic antenna is a measure of the maximum
radiation intensity of the antenna as compared with the intensity that would result from an isotropic
antenna, with the same power input. G is then expressed as
