Pulse-Code Modulation
PCM  is  essentially  analog-to-digital  conversion  of  a  special  type,  where  the  information  contained  in  the
instantaneous samples of an analog signal is represented by digital words in a serial bit stream. The PCM signal
is  generated  by  carrying  out  three  basic  operations:  sampling,  quantizing,  and  encoding  (see  Fig. 69.5).  The
sampling  operation  generates  a  ï¬‚at-top  pulse  amplitude  modulation  (PAM)  signal.  The  quantizing  converts
the  actual  sampled  value  into  the  nearest  of  the  M  amplitude  levels.  The  PCM  signal  is  obtained  from  the
quantized PAM signal by encoding each quantized sample value into a digital word.
