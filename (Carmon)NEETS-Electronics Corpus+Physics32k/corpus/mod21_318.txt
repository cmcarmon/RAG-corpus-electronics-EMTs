Resistance values ranging from 1 ohm to 1 megohm can be measured with an accuracy of 
approximately 0.1%. However, difficulties are encountered when very high and very low resistances are 
measured. Resistances less than 1 ohm are difficult to measure accurately because of uncertainty arising 
from the contact resistance present between the resistor to be measured and the binding posts of the 
bridge. Measurement of resistances greater than 1 megohm becomes difficult because of two factors: (1) 
The ratio of standard resistances RA and RB involve a ratio on the order of 1,000 to 1, and (2) the voltage 
applied to the bridge must be substantially increased to obtain definite galvanometer action. The result is 
that an increase in the supply voltage increases the power dissipation (heat) of the bridge resistors. The 
change in resistance RB, because of the heat, is sufficient to produce an appreciable error. A Kelvin bridge 
is recommended for measuring resistances lower than 1 ohm. An electronic multimeter is recommended 
for the indicating device in bridges used for the measurement of very high resistances.
