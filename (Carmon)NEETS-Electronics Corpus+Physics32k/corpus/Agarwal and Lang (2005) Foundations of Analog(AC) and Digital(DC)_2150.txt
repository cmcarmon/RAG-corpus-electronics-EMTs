In the two circuits already discussed, the feedback network sends a signal
back to the negative input terminal that is proportional to the output voltage
vo. Thus the circuit tends to stabilize this variable, thereby creating a voltage
source. By analogy, to make a current source, we must arrange to feed back
a signal proportional to the output current flowing in the circuit being driven
by the Op Amp. One possible topology is shown in Figure 15.15a. The circuit
looks, at first glance, like the non-inverting connection shown in Figure 15.15b,
