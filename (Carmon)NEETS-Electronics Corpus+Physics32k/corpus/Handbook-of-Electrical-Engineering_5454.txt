Standard Voltages
In  the  United  States,  the  underground  transmission  cables  are  rated  69  to  345  kV  (refer  to  Table 61.2  in
Section 61.1). Cables rated 550 kV are used commercially in Japan. In the United States, cables installed at the
550-kV level are used in relatively short distances, for example, at the Grand Coulee Dam.
