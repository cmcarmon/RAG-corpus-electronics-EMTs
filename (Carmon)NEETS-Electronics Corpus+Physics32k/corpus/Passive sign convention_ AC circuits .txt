Since the sign convention only deals with the directions of the variables and not with the direction of the actual current, it also applies to alternating current (AC) circuits, in which the direction of the voltage and current periodically reverses. In AC circuits, even though the voltage and current reverse direction, a "formal" direction of current flow and voltage polarity are defined by considering the voltage and current direction in the first half of the cycle "positive". During the second half of the AC cycle, in a resistive AC circuit, both the voltage and current in the device reverse direction, so the sign of the voltage and current reverse. Since the power is the product of voltage and current, the two sign reversals cancel each other, and the sign of the power flow is unchanged.
