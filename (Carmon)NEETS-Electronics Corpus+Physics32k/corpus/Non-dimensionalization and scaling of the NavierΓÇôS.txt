{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\nu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} +\mathbf {g} .}

where ρ is the density, p is the pressure, ν is the kinematic viscosity, u is the flow velocity, and g is the body acceleration field.
The above equation can be non-dimensionalized through selection of appropriate scales as follows:

Substituting the scales the non-dimensionalized equation obtained is:

where Fr is the Froude number and Re is the Reynolds number.
