The program is based on the equations governing voltage and current wave propagation along a lossless line.
Attenuation is then included using suitable lumped resistances. A major feature of the method is that inductance
and capacitance can both be represented by resistance in parallel with a current source. This allows a purely
resistive network to be formed.
