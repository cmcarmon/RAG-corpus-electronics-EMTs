where e is the square root of the ratio of the heat source area to the substrate area, k the thermal conductivity
of the substrate, and Ac the area of the heat source. For relatively thin layers on thicker substrates, Eq. (33.15)
cannot provide an acceptable prediction of Rc. Instead, use can be made of the numerical results plotted in Fig.
33.6 to obtain the requisite value of the spreading resistance.
