The  conductance  is  a  measure  of  how  well  an  element  will  con-
duct electric current. The unit of conductance is the mho (ohm spelled
backward)  or  reciprocal  ohm,  with  symbol 
,  the  inverted  omega.
Although  engineers  often  use  the  mho,  in  this  book  we  prefer  to  use
the siemens (S), the SI unit of conductance:
â«½ 1 A /  V
