The segregation problem is the problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to discrete "objects".
Smythies defined BP1 in these terms: "How is the representation of information built up in the neural networks that there is one single object 'out there' and not a mere collection of separate shapes, colours and movements?" Revonsuo refers to this as the problem of "stimulus-related binding" â€“ of sorting stimuli. Although usually referred to as a problem of binding, the computational problem is arguably one of discrimination. Thus, in the words of Canales et al.: "to bind together all the features of one object and segregate them from features of other objects and the background". Bartels and Zeki describe it as "determining that it is the same (or a different) stimulus which is activating different cells in a given visual area or in different visual areas".
