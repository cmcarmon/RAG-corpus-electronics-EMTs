We can use the transfer function to Ô¨Ånd the output when the input voltage is a sinusoid for two reasons.
First of all, a sinusoid is the sum of two complex exponentials, each having a frequency equal to the negative
of the other. Secondly, because the circuit is linear, superposition applies. If the source is a sine wave, we
know that
