Conclusions
The  ECG  is  one  of  the  oldest  instrument-bound  measurements  in  medicine.  It  has  faithfully  followed  the
progression  of  instrumentation  technology.  Its  most  recent  evolutionary  step,  to  the  microprocessor-based
system, has allowed for an enhanced, high-resolution ECG which has opened new vistas of ECG analysis and
interpretation.
