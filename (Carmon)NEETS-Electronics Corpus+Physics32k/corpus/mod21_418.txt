Today's ELECTRONIC FREQUENCY COUNTERS are capable of measuring frequencies from 
dc to 40 GHz. Most have added features that enable period averaging, time-interval measurements, and 
scaling. Frequency counter accuracy can be extended by using an external frequency standard in lieu of 
its internal frequency standard.
