By employing psychoacoustic noise-masking properties of the human ear, perceptual encoding evolved from
early work of the 1970s and where high-quality speech coders were employed. Music quality bit-rate reduction
schemes  such  as  MPEG  (Motion  Picture  Expert  Group),  PASC  (Precision  Adaptive  Subband  Coding),  and
ATRAC (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding) have been developed. Further reﬁnements to the technology
will focus attention on novel approaches such as wavelet-based coding and the use of entropy coding schemes.
However, recent progress has been signiﬁcant, and the various audio coding schemes that have been demon-
strated publicly over the time period from 1990 to 1995 have shown steady increases in compression ratios at
given audio quality levels.
