TRANSISTOR AMPLIFIER GAIN.â€”You have seen how a dc voltage that is obtained at the
output of the agc network is proportional to, and will reflect, the average variations of the average signal
level. Now all we have to do is use this agc voltage to control the amplification of one or more of the
preceding amplifiers. Figure 2-17 illustrates a common-emitter amplifier with agc applied to the base
element. A change in the agc voltage will change the operating point of the transistor and the dc emitter
current. In this circuit, R1 and R4 form a voltage divider and establish no-signal (forward) bias on the
base. Since a pnp transistor is used, the base has a negative potential. The agc voltage from the detector is
positive with respect to ground and is fed to the base through dropping resistor R2. You will find when
the dc output of the detector increases (because of an increase in the average signal level) the agc voltage
will become more positive. This increased positive potential is applied to the base of Q1, which decreases
the forward bias of Q1 and decreases the gain of the amplifier. Agc, in this application, works with
