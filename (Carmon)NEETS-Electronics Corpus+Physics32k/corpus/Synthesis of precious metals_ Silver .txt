Silver is produced as result of nuclear fission in small amounts (approximately 0.1%). Because of this, extraction of silver from highly radioactive fission products would be uneconomical, but when recovered with ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium (price of silver in 2011: about 880 €/kg; rhodium; and ruthenium: about 30,000 €/kg) the economics change substantially; silver becomes a byproduct of platinoid metal recovery from fission waste.
