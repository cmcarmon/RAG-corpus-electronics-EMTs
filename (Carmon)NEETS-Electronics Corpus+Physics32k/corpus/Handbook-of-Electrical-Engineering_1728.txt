Image compression algorithms depend for their success on two separate factors: redundancy and irrelevancy.
Redundancy  refers  to  the  fact  that  each  pixel  in  an  image  does  not  take  on  all  possible  values  with  equal
probability, and the value that it does take on is not independent of that of the other pixels in the image. If
this were not true, the image would appear as a white noise pattern such as that seen when a television receiver
is  tuned  to  an  unused  channel.  From  an  information-theoretic  point  of  view,  such  an  image  contains  the
