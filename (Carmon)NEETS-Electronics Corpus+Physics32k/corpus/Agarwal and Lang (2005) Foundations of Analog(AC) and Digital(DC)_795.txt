p r o b l e m 5.14 Many manufacturing flaws in digital circuits can be modeled as
stuck-at faults. The output of a gate is said to suffer from a stuck-at-1 fault if the output
is a 1 irrespective of its input values. Similarly, a stuck-at-0 fault at an output causes the
output to produce a 0 at all times.
