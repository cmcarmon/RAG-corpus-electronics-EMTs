Conservation laws have to be enforced independently of
a user-deﬁned partitioning of the entire model into design
entities. This implies that the interface description of en-
tities requires an enhancement. The connection pins of an
entity, denoted as ports in VHDL terminology, may now
carry waveforms of different qualities: digital signals and con-
tinuous quantities of some physical domain with or without
conservation requirements as given in Table 3.3. The new
interface description syntax of VHDL–AMS is given here;
note that the compatability for VHDL 1076 is accomplished
by a blank PortAttribute, which is interpreted as the signal
attribute:
