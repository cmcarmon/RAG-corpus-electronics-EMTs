A  weakly  stationary  Gaussian  process  is  strongly  stationary  to  all  orders  n:  all  Gaussian  joint  pdf’s  are
completely determined by their ﬁrst and second moments by Eq. (73.45), and those moments are time inde-
pendent by weak stationarity, and so all joint pdf’s are also. Every second-order strongly stationary stochastic
process X(t) is also weakly stationary because the time translation independence of the joint pdf’s determines
the ﬁrst and second moments to have the same property. However, non-Gaussian weakly stationary processes
need not be strongly second-order stationary.
