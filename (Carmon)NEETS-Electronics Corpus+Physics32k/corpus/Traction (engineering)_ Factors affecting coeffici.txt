Traction between two surfaces depends on several factors:
Material composition of each surface.
Macroscopic and microscopic shape (texture; macrotexture and microtexture)
Normal force pressing contact surfaces together.
Contaminants at the material boundary including lubricants and adhesives.
Relative motion of tractive surfaces - a sliding object (one in kinetic friction) has less traction than a non-sliding object (one in static friction).
Direction of traction relative to some coordinate system - e.g., the available traction of a tire often differs between cornering, accelerating, and braking.
For low-friction surfaces, such as off-road or ice, traction can be increased by using traction devices that partially penetrate the surface; these devices use the shear strength of the underlying surface rather than relying solely on dry friction (e.g., aggressive off-road tread or snow chains)....
