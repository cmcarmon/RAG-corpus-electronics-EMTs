General Lighting.
It should be designed to provide the desired level of illumination uniformly over the
entire area. The variation of light level from point to point within the area should be within 17% of the
selected  level.  A  good  general  lighting  system  makes  it  possible  to  change  the  location  of  machinery
without rearranging the lighting and also permits full utilization of ﬂoor space.
Localized  General  Lighting.
Within  a  general  area  there  may  be  a  few  areas  where  tasks  performed
require a greater quantity of light and a different quality of light. When applied, care must be exercised
to eliminate direct or reﬂected glare from the task and from other workers.
Supplementary  lighting  is  speciﬁed  for  different  seeing  tasks  that  require  a

speciﬁc amount or quality of light not readily obtained by standard general lighting methods. Supple-
mentary  lighting  is  a  valuable  industrial  lighting  tool.  Typical  problems  arise  where  work  is  shielded
from  the  general  lighting  system  by  an  obstruction  or  its  brightness  is  otherwise  lowered  where  low
contrast,  such  as  scribe  marks  on  steel,  may  lead  to  visual  errors,  and  where  the  product  moves  too
rapidly to be seen clearly by the unaided eye. To attain a good balance, it is important to coordinate the
design of supplementary and general lighting with great care.
