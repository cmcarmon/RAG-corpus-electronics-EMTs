The schematic diagram of this circuit is shown in figure 3-33. L1 is the schematic symbol for a
saturable-core reactor. The control winding is shown with five loops, and the load winding is shown with
three loops. The double bar between the inductors stands for an iron core, and the symbol that cuts across
the two windings is a saturable-core symbol indicating that the two windings share a saturable core.
