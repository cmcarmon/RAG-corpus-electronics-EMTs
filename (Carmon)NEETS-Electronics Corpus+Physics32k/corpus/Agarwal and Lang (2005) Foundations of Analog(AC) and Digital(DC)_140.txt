A thin poly-crystalline silicon resistor is 1 µm thick, 10 µm wide, and 100 µm long,
−6 m. If the resistivity of its poly-crystalline silicon ranges from
where 1 µm is 10
−6 m to 102 m, what is the range of its resistance?
10
The cross-sectional area of the resistor is A = 10
Thus l/A = 107 m
resistance satisfies 10  ≤ R ≤ 109 .
