The basic relationship for heat transfer by convection is:

{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}=hA(T_{a}-T_{b})}

where






Q

{\displaystyle {\dot {Q}}}
is the heat transferred per unit time, A is the area of the object, h is the heat transfer coefficient, Ta is the object's surface temperature and Tb is the fluid temperature.
The convective heat transfer coefficient is dependent upon the physical properties of the fluid and the physical situation. Values of h have been measured and tabulated for commonly encountered fluids and flow situations.
