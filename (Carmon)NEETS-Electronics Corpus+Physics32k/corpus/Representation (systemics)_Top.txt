Representation, from the most general and abstract systemic perspective, relates to a role or function or a property of an abstract or real object, relation or changes.
For example,
an ambassador or a sport team may represent its nation.
graphical figures or written symbolic text may represent some abstract ideas or physical objects.
In the case of humans or human-made objects, a representation can be:
formal or informal, i.e. "legal" or actually realized with a consensus of interested community.
on the behalf of (or approved by) represented subject or without his/her/their permission.
