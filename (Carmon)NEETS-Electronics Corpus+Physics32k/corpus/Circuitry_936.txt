where Ap, Av or Ai is the power, voltage or current 
gain (or loss) expressed as a ratio, Pin and Pout are 
the  input  and  output  powers,  Vin  and  Vout  are  the 
input  and  output  voltages,  and  Iin  and  Iout  are  the 
input  and  output  currents.  Note,  however,  that  the 
powers, voltages or currents should be expressed in 
the  same  units/multiples  (e.g.  Pin  and  Pout  should 
both be expressed in W, mW, ÂµW or nW). 
 
It  is  often  more  convenient  to  express  gain  in 
decibels  (rather  than  as  a  simple  ratio)  using  the 
following relationships:
