(15.2.13)
for wide-band FM with ω >> Wf , where Wf is the spectral extent of f (t); i.e., the message
signal has a low-pass bandwidth Wf. For example, commercial FM broadcasting utilizes Wf =
2π(15 × 103) rad/s (corresponding to 15 kHz) and ω = 5Wf such that ωFM = 14Wf . Because
the performance of narrow-band FM with noise is roughly equivalent to that of AM systems, only
wide-band FM that exhibits a marked improvement will be considered here.
