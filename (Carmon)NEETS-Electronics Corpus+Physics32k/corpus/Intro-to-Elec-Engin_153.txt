Besides representing complete one-ports (or two-terminal networks), Th√©venin and Norton
equivalents can be applied to portions of a network (with respect to any two terminals) to
simplify intermediate calculations. Moreover, successive conversions back and forth between the
two equivalents often save considerable labor in circuit analysis with multiple sources. Source
transformations can be used effectively by replacing the voltage source V with a series resistance
R by an equivalent current source I (= V /R) in parallel with the same resistance R, or vice versa.
