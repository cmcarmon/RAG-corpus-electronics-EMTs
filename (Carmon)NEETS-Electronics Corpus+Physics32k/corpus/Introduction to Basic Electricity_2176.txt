Ferromagnetic	materials are materials that 
 respond to magnetic fields. In ferromagnetic materials, 
the atoms combine into domains, or groups of  atoms 
arranged in the form of magnets. In an unmagnetized 
material, the magnetic domains are randomly arranged, 
and the net magnetic effect is zero (Figure 18-3).  
When the material becomes magnetized, the domains 
align in a common direction and the material becomes 
a magnet (Figure 18-4). If the magnetized material 
is divided into smaller pieces, each piece becomes a 
magnet with its own poles.
