The magnitude of stagnation pressure can be derived from a simplified form of Bernoulli Equation. For incompressible flow,





P

P

static




{\displaystyle P_{\text{stagnation}}={\tfrac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}+P_{\text{static}}}

where:





P

stagnation




{\displaystyle P_{\text{stagnation}}}
is the stagnation pressure




ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \;}
is the fluid density




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the speed of fluid





P

static




{\displaystyle P_{\text{static}}}
is the static pressure at any point.
At a stagnation point, the velocity of the fluid is zero. If the gravity head of the fluid at a particular point in a fluid flow is zero, then the stagnation pressure at that particular point is equal to total pressure. However, in general, total pressure differs from stagnation pressure in that total pressure equals the sum of stagnation pressure and gravity head.

{\displaystyle P_{\text{total}}=0+P_{\text{stagnation}}\;}

In compressible flow the stagnation pressure is equal to total pressure only if the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically. For many purposes in compressible flow, the stagnation enthalpy or stagnation temperature plays a role similar to the stagnation pressure in incompressible flow.
