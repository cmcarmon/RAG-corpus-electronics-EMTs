• Velocity control systems.
• Regulators. Their function consists in keeping the output or controlled variable constant
in spite of load variations and parameter changes. Speed control of a motor forms a good
example. Feedback control systems used as regulators are said to be type 0 systems,
which have a steady-state position error with a constant position input.
