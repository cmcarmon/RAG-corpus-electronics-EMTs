By definition, lift is perpendicular to the oncoming flow. As the left wing moves up, its effective angle of attack is decreased, so its lift vector tilts back. Conversely, as the right wing descends, its lift vector tilts forward. The result is an adverse yaw moment to the left, opposite to the intended right turn.
