The following is similar to that of Einstein. As in the Galilean transformation, the Lorentz transformation is linear since the relative velocity of the reference frames is constant as a vector; otherwise, inertial forces would appear. They are called inertial or Galilean reference frames. According to relativity no Galilean reference frame is privileged. Another condition is that the speed of light must be independent of the reference frame, in practice of the velocity of the light source.
Consider two inertial frames of reference O and O′, assuming O to be at rest while O′ is moving with a velocity v with respect to O in the positive x-direction. The origins of O and O′ initially coincide with each other. A light signal is emitted from the common origin and travels as a spherical wave front. Consider a point P on a spherical wavefront at a distance r and r′ from the origins of O and O′ respectively. According to the second postulate of the special theory of relativity the speed of light is the same in both frames, so for the point P:








r



=
c
t





r
′




=
c

t
′

.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}r&=ct\\r'&=ct'.\end{aligned}}}

The equation of a sphere in frame O is given by





x

2


+

y

2


+

z

2


=

r

2


.


{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=r^{2}.}

For the spherical wavefront that becomes





x

2


+

y

2


+

z

2


=

c

2



t

2


.


{\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=c^{2}t^{2}.}

Similarly, the equation of a sphere in frame O′ is given by





x

′

2



+

y

′

2



+

z

′

2



=

r

′

2



,


{\displaystyle x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}=r'^{2},}

so the spherical wavefront satisfies





x

′

2



+

y

′

2



+

z

′

2



=

c

2



t

′

2



.


{\displaystyle x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}=c^{2}t'^{2}.}

The origin O′ is moving along x-axis. Therefore,









y
′




=
y





z
′




=
z
.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}y'&=y\\z'&=z.\end{aligned}}}

x′ must vary linearly with x and t. Therefore, the transformation has the form





x
′

=
γ
x
+
σ
t
.


{\displaystyle x'=\gamma x+\sigma t.}

For the origin of O′ x' and x are given by









x
′




=
0




x



=
v
t
,






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=0\\x&=vt,\end{aligned}}}

so, for all t,




0
=
γ
v
t
+
σ
t


{\displaystyle 0=\gamma vt+\sigma t}

and thus




σ
=
−
γ
v
.


{\displaystyle \sigma =-\gamma v.}

This simplifies the transformation to





x
′

=
γ

(

x
−
v
t

)



{\displaystyle x'=\gamma \left(x-vt\right)}

where γ is to be determined. At this point γ is not necessarily a constant, but is required to reduce to 1 for v ≪ c.
The inverse transformation is the same except that the sign of v is reversed:




x
=
γ

(


x
′

+
v

t
′


)

.


{\displaystyle x=\gamma \left(x'+vt'\right).}

The above two equations give the relation between t and t′ as:




x
=
γ

[

γ

(

x
−
v
t

)

+
v

t
′


]



{\displaystyle x=\gamma \left[\gamma \left(x-vt\right)+vt'\right]}

or





t
′

=

t
+




(

1
−


γ

2




)

x


γ
v



.


{\displaystyle t'=\gamma t+{\frac {\left(1-{\gamma ^{2}}\right)x}{\gamma v}}.}

Replacing x′, y′, z′ and t′ in the spherical wavefront equation in the O′ frame,





x

′

2



+

y

′

2



+

z

′

2



=

c

2



t

′

2



,


{\displaystyle x'^{2}+y'^{2}+z'^{2}=c^{2}t'^{2},}

with their expressions in terms of x, y, z and t produces:

{\displaystyle {\gamma ^{2}}\left(x-vt\right)^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=c^{2}\left[\gamma t+{\frac {\left(1-{\gamma ^{2}}\right)x}{\gamma v}}\right]^{2}}

and therefore,

Comparing the coefficient of t2 in the above equation with the coefficient of t2 in the spherical wavefront equation for frame O produces:

γ

{\displaystyle c^{2}{\gamma ^{2}}-v^{2}{\gamma ^{2}}=c^{2}}

Equivalent expressions for γ can be obtained by matching the x2 coefficients or setting the tx coefficient to zero. Rearranging:






γ

=

v

c

{\displaystyle {\gamma ^{2}}={\frac {1}{1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}

or, choosing the positive root to ensure that the x and x' axes and the time axes point in the same direction,





γ

v

c

{\displaystyle {\gamma }={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}

which is called the Lorentz factor. This produces the Lorentz transformation from the above expression. It is given by









x

=

(

x

)






t

=

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'&=\gamma \left(x-vt\right)\\t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\y'&=y\\z'&=z\end{aligned}}}

The Lorentz transformation is not the only transformation leaving invariant the shape of spherical waves, as there is a wider set of spherical wave transformations in the context of conformal geometry, leaving invariant the expression



λ

δ

)



{\displaystyle \lambda \left(\delta x^{2}+\delta y^{2}+\delta z^{2}-c^{2}\delta t^{2}\right)}
. However, scale changing conformal transformations cannot be used to symmetrically describe all laws of nature including mechanics, whereas the Lorentz transformations (the only one implying



λ
=
1


{\displaystyle \lambda =1}
) represent a symmetry of all laws of nature and reduce to Galilean transformations at



v
≪
c


{\displaystyle v\ll c}
.
