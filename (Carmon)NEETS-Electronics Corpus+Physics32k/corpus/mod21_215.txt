One convenient method of testing a diode requires only your ohmmeter. The forward and back
resistances can be measured at a voltage determined by the battery potential of the ohmmeter and the
resistance range at which the meter is set. When the test leads of the ohmmeter are connected to the diode,
a resistance will be measured that is different from the resistance indicated if the leads are reversed. The
smaller value is called the forward resistance, and the larger value is called the back resistance. If the ratio
of back-to-forward resistance is greater than 10 to 1, the diode should be capable of functioning as a
rectifier. This is a very limited test, which does not take into account the action of the diode at voltages of
