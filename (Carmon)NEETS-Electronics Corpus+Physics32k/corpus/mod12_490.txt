The peak detector circuit may also be used for pdm. To detect pdm, you must modify view (A) of
figure 3-21 so that the time constant for charging C1 through CR1 is at least 10 times the maximum
received pulse width. This may be done by adding a resistor in series with the cathode or anode circuit of
CR1. The amplitude of the voltage to which C1 charges, before being discharged by the negative pulse,
will be directly proportional to the input pulse width. A longer pulse width allows C1 to charge to a
higher potential than a short pulse. This charge is held, because of the long time constant of R1 and C1,
until the discharge pulse is applied to diodes CR2 and CR3 just prior to the next incoming pulse. These
charges across C1 result in a wave shape similar to the output shown for pam detection in view (C) of
figure 3-21.
