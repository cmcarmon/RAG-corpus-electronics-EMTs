If we join a section of N-type semiconductor material with a similar section of P-type semiconductor
material, we obtain a device known as a PN JUNCTION. (The area where the N and P regions meet is
appropriately called the junction.) The usual characteristics of this device make it extremely useful in
electronics as a diode rectifier. The diode rectifier or PN junction diode performs the same function as its
counterpart in electron tubes but in a different way. The diode is nothing more than a two-element
semiconductor device that makes use of the rectifying properties of a PN junction to convert alternating
current into direct current by permitting current flow in only one direction. The schematic symbol of a PN
junction diode is shown in figure 1-12. The vertical bar represents the cathode (N-type material) since it is
the source of electrons and the arrow represents the anode. (P-type material) since it is the destination of
the electrons. The label "CR1" is an alphanumerical code used to identify the diode. In this figure, we
have only one diode so it is labeled CR1 (crystal rectifier number one). If there were four diodes shown in
the diagram, the last diode would be labeled CR4. The heavy dark line shows electron flow. Notice it is
against the arrow. For further clarification, a pictorial diagram of a PN junction and an actual
semiconductor (one of many types) are also illustrated.
