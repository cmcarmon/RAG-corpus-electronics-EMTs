The electric potential energy of a system of point charges is defined as the work required assembling this system of charges by bringing them close together, as in the system from an infinite distance.
The electrostatic potential energy, UE, of one point charge q at position r in the presence of an electric field E is defined as the negative of the work W done by the electrostatic force to bring it from the reference position rref to that position r.

where E is the electrostatic field and dr' is the displacement vector in a curve from the reference position rref to the final position r.
The electrostatic potential energy can also be defined from the electric potential as follows:
The electrostatic potential energy, UE, of one point charge q at position r in the presence of an electric potential




Φ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \Phi }
is defined as the product of the charge and the electric potential.

where




Φ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \Phi }
is the electric potential generated by the charges, which is a function of position r.
