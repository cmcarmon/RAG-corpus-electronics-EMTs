While  PZT  and  other  ferroelectric  (FE)  bulk  materials  have  had  major  commercial  importance,  thin  ﬁlms
prepared from these materials have only recently been the focus of signiﬁcant research efforts. In this section
the material properties and process issues will be discussed. Because of the potentially large payoff, major efforts
have been directed at developing the technologies for depositing thin ﬁlms of ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric
but high epsilon (high dielectric constant) thin ﬁlms.
