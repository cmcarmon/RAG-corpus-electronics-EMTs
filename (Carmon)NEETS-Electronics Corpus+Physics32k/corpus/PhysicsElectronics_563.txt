A similar circuit result can be obtained with the Sziklai connection of Ô¨Ågure 5.20b.
Because it uses one transistor of each polarity (NPN and PNP), this connection is also
known as the complementary Darlington. The combination again results in a three-terminal
device that behaves like a single high-current-gain transistor. The overall circuit behaves
like a transistor of the same polarity as Q1.
