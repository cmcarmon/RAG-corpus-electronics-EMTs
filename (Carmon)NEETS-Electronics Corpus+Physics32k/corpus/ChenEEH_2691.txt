numerical dispersion artifacts generated by the basic grid-
based solution of the curl equations. Fortunately, by the end
of the 1990s, this problem was being attacked by a new gener-
ation of
low-dispersion algorithms. Examples include the
wavelet-based multiresolution time-domain (MRTD) tech-
nique introduced by Krumpholz and Katehi (1996) and the
pseudo-spectral time-domain (PSTD) technique introduced
by Liu, (1996, 1997). As a result of these advances, there is
the possible emergence of FDTD and related space-grid time-
domain methods, demonstrating predictive dynamic ranges of
80 dB or more in the Ô¨Årst decade of the 21st century.
