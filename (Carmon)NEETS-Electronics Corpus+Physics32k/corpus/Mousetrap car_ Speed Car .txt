Making a speed mousetrap car, involves extracting the most energy you can from the mousetraps spring in a short distance. For the lever arm it needs to be shorter than compared to the distance car because the shorter the arm is the quicker the spring will snap and the more torque you will get from the spring. Then make sure that most of the weight of the car is distributed tot he back where the drive axle is located. That way the car will not have much drag in the front, slowing it down. For this car the wheels don't need to be that big but the axle should be larger in relation to the wheel. Make sure that the wheels have good traction, with out the right amount of friction the wheels attached to the drive axle will slip due to all the torque.
