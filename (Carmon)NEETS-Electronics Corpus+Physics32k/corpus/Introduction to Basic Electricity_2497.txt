The clamp-on	meter is based on the principle 
that an AC current flowing in a conductor causes a 
magnetic field to expand and collapse as the current 
increases and decreases in value (Figure 22-5). Each 
time the AC current changes polarity, the magnetic field 
changes  direction. The clamp-on AC meter uses a split-
core transformer that allows the core to be opened and 
placed around the conductor. At the end of the core is 
a coil, which is cut by the magnetic lines of force. This 
induces a voltage into the coil, creating a flow of alter-
nating current. This AC current must be rectified before 
being sent to the meter movement, generally a moving 
coil. This type of meter is used for measuring high val-
ues of AC current. The current in the conductor must be 
large in order to produce a magnetic field strong enough 
to induce a current flow in the core of the meter.
