. Minor disturbances such as normal random load ï¬‚uctu-
ations, are denoted small-disturbances, and the ability of
the power system to damp out such small disturbances is
called small-signal stability. In the next section, we will
learn that small-signal stability can be understood by
computing the eigenvalues of the system Jacobian matrix
that is evaluated at an equilibrium point.
