lowered by several orders of magnitude and are even further
lowered in the presence of ionic contaminants on the surface.
For dielectric materials that do not contain large voids or
impurities, which is typical of a well-made insulator, the elec-
tric stress required for failure via the surrounding air medium
is much lower than for bulk failure. Such failures are called
ﬂashovers. The arc produced by the ﬂashover is usually away
from the surface of the dielectric. Therefore, as far as ﬂashovers
are concerned, porcelain, glass, and composite insulators are
self-restoring types of insulation.
