In principle, all reactions are reversible however in practice reactions often effectively occur in only one direction. This may be due to significantly higher concentration of reactants compared to the concentration of the products of the reaction. But more often it happens because the products of a reaction have a much lower free energy than the reactants and therefore the forward direction of a reaction is favored more.

For certain reactions a thermodynamic constraint can be applied implying direction (in this case forward)

Realistically the flux through a reaction cannot be infinite (given that enzymes in the real system are finite) which implies that,
