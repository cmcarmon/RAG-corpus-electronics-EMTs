of interest and effort between them. For example, biomedical engineers engaged in the development of bio-
sensors may interact with those interested in prosthetic devices to develop a means to detect and use the same
bioelectric signal to power a prosthetic device. Those engaged in automating the clinical chemistry laboratory
may  collaborate  with  those  developing  expert  systems  to  assist  clinicians  in  making  clinical  decisions  based
upon speciÔ¨Åc laboratory data. The possibilities are endless.
