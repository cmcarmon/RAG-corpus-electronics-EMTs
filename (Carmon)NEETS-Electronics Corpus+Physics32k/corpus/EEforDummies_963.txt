Grounding your tools
The tools you use when building electronics projects can also build up static 
electricity — a lot of it. If your soldering iron operates from AC current, 
ground it to defend against ESD. There’s a double benefit here: A grounded 
soldering iron not only helps prevent damage from ESD but also lessens the 
chance of a bad shock if you accidentally touch a live wire with the iron.
