Besides measuring individual cables, test personnel measure the transmission loss of installed fiber
optic cable plants. The transmission loss of fiber optic cable plants is measured using EIA/TIA-526-14
method B (multimode fiber) or EIA/TIA-526-7 (single mode fiber). The procedure measures the internal
loss of the cable plant between points A and B, plus two connection losses. Figure 5-18 (A) illustrates the
method described in EIA/TIA-526-14 method B for measuring the reference power (P1). Figure 5-18 (B)
shows the final test configuration for measuring the cable plant test power (P2).
