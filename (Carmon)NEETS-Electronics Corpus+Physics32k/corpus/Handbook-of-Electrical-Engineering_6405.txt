If we let the number of coefﬁcients of a ZF equalizer increase without bound, we would obtain an inﬁnite-
length equalizer with zero ISI at its output. An inﬁnite-length zero-ISI equalizer is simply an inverse ﬁlter, which
inverts  the  folded  frequency  response  of  the  channel.  Clearly,  the  ZF  criterion  neglects  the  effect  of  noise
altogether. A ﬁnite-length ZF equalizer is approximately inverse to the folded frequency response of the channel.
Also, a ﬁnite-length ZF equalizer is guaranteed to minimize the peak distortion or worst-case ISI only if the
peak distortion before equalization is less than 100% [Lucky, 1965].
