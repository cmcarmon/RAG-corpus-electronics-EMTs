Examples of dynamic systems that are controlled in such a closed-loop digital fashion are ï¬‚ight control of
civilian and military aircraft, control of process variables in chemical processing plants, and position and force
control in industrial robot manipulators. The simplest form of feedback control strategy provides an on-off
control  to  the  controlling  variables  based  on  measured  values  of  the  process  variables.  This  strategy  will  be
illustrated by a simple example in a following subsection.
