A complete architecture for intelligent fault diagnosis and
accommodation has also been presented by incorporating the
proposed intelligent fault-tolerant control technique with a
cost-effective fault-detection scheme and a multiple model-
based failure diagnosis process to efÔ¨Åciently handle the false
