functions. Current ﬂow is dominated by majority carriers. The
Schottky diode has a negligible stored charge in the drift region
because of a lack of minority carriers. The switching transients
do not include forward and reverse recovery. A ﬁnite transient
recovery is observed because of the capacitance associated with
the depletion region. However, the reverse leakage current is
considerably higher than for P-i-N diodes. Furthermore, at
higher voltage rating, the Schottky diode has a considerable
voltage drop in the drift region, expressed as:
