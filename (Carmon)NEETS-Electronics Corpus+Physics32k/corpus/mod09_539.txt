exceeds −4 volts (T1). D1 becomes reverse biased as the anode becomes more negative than the cathode. 
While the input signal is more negative than the −4 volts of the bias battery (T1 to T2), the diode is 
reverse biased and remains cut off. The output follows the input signal from T1 to T2. At all other times 
during that cycle, the diode is forward biased and limiting occurs. This circuit is called a parallel-positive 
limiter with negative bias because the positive output is limited and the bias in the circuit is negative with 
reference to ground. Limiting takes place at all points more positive than −4 volts.
