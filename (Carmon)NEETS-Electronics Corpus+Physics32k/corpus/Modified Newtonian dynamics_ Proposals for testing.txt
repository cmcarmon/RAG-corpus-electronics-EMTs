Several observational and experimental tests have been proposed to help distinguish between MOND and dark matter-based models:
The detection of particles suitable for constituting cosmological dark matter would strongly suggest that Î›CDM is correct and no modification to Newton's laws is required.
MOND predicts the existence of anomalous accelerations on the Earth at particular places and times of the year. These could be detected in a precision experiment.
It has been suggested that MOND could be tested in the Solar System using the LISA Pathfinder mission (launched in 2015). In particular, it may be possible to detect the anomalous tidal stresses predicted by MOND to exist at the Earth-Sun saddlepoint of the Newtonian gravitational potential. It may also be possible to measure MOND corrections to the perihelion precession of the planets in the Solar System, or a purpose-built spacecraft.
One potential astrophysical test of MOND is to investigate whether isolated galaxies behave differently from otherwise-identical galaxies that are under the influence of a strong external field. Another is to search for non-Newtonian behaviour in the motion of binary star systems where the stars are sufficiently separated for their accelerations to be below a0.
Testing modified gravity with black hole shadows - John Moffat calculates that the black hole shadow should appear larger by a factor of about ten in MOG as compared to general relativity.
