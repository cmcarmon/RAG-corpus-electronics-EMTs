To clarify these points, figure 3-61 illustrates a series parallel circuit. First the effect of an open in
the series portion of this circuit will be examined. Figure 3-61(A) shows the normal circuit, RT = 40 ohms
and IT = 3 amps. In figure 3-61(B) an open is shown in the series portion of the circuit, there is no
complete path for current and the resistance of the circuit is considered to be infinite.
