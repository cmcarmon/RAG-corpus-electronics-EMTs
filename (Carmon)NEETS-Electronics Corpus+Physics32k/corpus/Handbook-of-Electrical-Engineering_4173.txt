No  charge  is  removed  by  the  transmission  line  return  stroke  current  along  the  channel  since  the  charge
entering the bottom of any section of the channel leaves the top when the current reaches it. All the charge is
therefore transferred from the bottom to the top of the channel, an unrealistic situation given our knowledge
of lightning physics.
