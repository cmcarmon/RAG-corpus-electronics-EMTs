The body adiposity index (BAI) is a method of measuring the amount of body fat in humans. The BAI is calculated without using body weight, unlike the body mass index (BMI). Instead, it uses the size of the hips compared to the person's height.
Based on population studies, the BAI is approximately equal to the percentage of body fat for adult men and women of differing ethnicities.
