Different  FPGA  manufacturers  have  developed  different  basic  cells,  seeking  to  provide  the  most  useful
functionality in the cells for generation of overall FPGA functions. Cells range from ﬁne-grained cells consisting
of basic gates through medium-grained cells providing more complex programmable functions to large-grained
cells. Different FPGA manufacturers also provide different approaches to the programming step. FPGA pro-
gramming technologies include one-time programming or multiple-time programming capabilities with the
programming  either  nonvolatile  (i.e.,  programming  is  retained  when  power  is  turned  off)  or  volatile  (i.e.,
programming is lost when power is turned off). Physical programming includes antifuse (fuse) approaches in
which  the  programming  nodes  are  normally  off  (on)  and  are  “blown”  into  a  permanently  on  (off)  state,
providing one-time, nonvolatile programming. Electrical switches also can be used for programming, with an
electrical control signal setting the state of the switch. The state control signal can be provided by an EPROM
(one-time, nonvolatile), an EEPROM (multiple-time, nonvolatile), or an SRAM (multiple-time, volatile), with
different approaches having different advantages and disadvantages.
