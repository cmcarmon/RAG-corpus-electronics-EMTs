• Signal Set Choice — The diﬀerence between the signal-dependent terms in the integrators’ outputs
(equations (6.45)) deﬁnes how large the noise term must be for an incorrect receiver decision to result.
What aﬀects the probability of such errors occurring is the energy in the diﬀerence of the received
signals in comparison to the noise term’s variability. The signal-diﬀerence energy equals
