where λ = (ε
0kT/e2n)1/2. For high-quality GaN/Al2O3, Ndis ≈ 108 cm–2; in the case of a sample discussed later in
this  chapter  section,  this  value  of  Ndis  drops  the  300-K  Hall  mobility  only  a  minor  amount,  from  915  to
885 cm2/V s.  However,  if  this  same  sample  contained  the  usual  concentration  of  dislocations  found  in  GaN
(about 1010 cm–2), the mobility would drop to less than 100 cm2/V s, a typical value found in many other samples.
H, which avoids the integrations
