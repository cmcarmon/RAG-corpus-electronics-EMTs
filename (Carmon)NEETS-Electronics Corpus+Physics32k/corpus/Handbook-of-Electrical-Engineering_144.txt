Principle of Transformation
The actual process of transfer of electrical power from a voltage of V1 to a voltage of V2 is explained with the
aid of the simpliﬁed transformer representation shown in Fig. 1.23. Application of voltage across the primary
winding of the transformer results in a magnetic ﬁeld of f1 Wb in the magnetic core, which in turn induces
a voltage of  V2 at the secondary terminals. V1 and  V2 are related by the expression V1/V2 = N1/N2, where N1
and N2 are the number of turns in the primary and secondary windings, respectively. If a load current of  I2 A
is drawn from the secondary terminals, the load current establishes a magnetic ﬁeld of f2 Wb in the core and
in the direction shown. Since the effect of load current is to reduce the amount of primary magnetic ﬁeld, the
reduction in f1 results in an increase in the primary current I1 so that the net magnetic ﬁeld is almost restored
to the initial value and the slight reduction in the ﬁeld is due to leakage magnetic ﬂux. The currents in the
two windings are related by the expression I1/I2 =  N2/N1. Since V1/V2 =  N1/N2 =  I2/I1, we have the expression
V1 · I1 = V2 ·  I2. Therefore, the voltamperes in the two windings are equal in theory. In reality, there is a slight
loss  of  power  during  transformation  that  is  due  to  the  energy  necessary  to  set  up  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  and  to
overcome the losses in the transformer core and windings. Transformers are static power conversion devices
and  are  therefore  highly  efﬁcient.  Transformer  efﬁciencies  are  about  95%  for  small  units  (15  kVA  and  less),
and the efﬁciency can be higher than 99% for units rated above 5 MVA.
