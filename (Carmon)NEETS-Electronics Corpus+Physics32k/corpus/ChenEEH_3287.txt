Loads
Modeling power system loads remains a difﬁcult problem. The
large number of different devices that could be connected to
the network at any given time renders precise modeling in-
tractable. Broadly speaking, loads may vary with voltage and
frequency. In the steady-state, frequency is constant, so the
only concern is voltage. For most steady-state analysis, a ﬁxed
(i.e., constant over an allowable voltage range) power con-
sumption model can be used. Still, some analysis requires
consideration of voltage effects to be useful, and then the
traditional exponential model can be used to represent real
power consumption P and reactive power consumption Q as:
