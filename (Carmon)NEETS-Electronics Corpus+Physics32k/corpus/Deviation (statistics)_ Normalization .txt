Deviations have units of the measurement scale (for instance, meters if measuring lengths). One can nondimensionalize in two ways.
One way is by dividing by a measure of scale (statistical dispersion), most often either the population standard deviation, in standardizing, or the sample standard deviation, in studentizing (e.g., Studentized residual).
One can scale instead by location, not dispersion: the formula for a percent deviation is the observed value minus accepted value divided by the accepted value multiplied by 100%.
