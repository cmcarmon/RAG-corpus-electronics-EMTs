TDMA relies on the fact that the audio signal has been digi-
tized (i.e., divided into a number of millisecond-long packets).
It allocates a single frequency channel for a short period of
time and then moves to another channel. The digital samples
from a single transmitter occupy different time slots in several
bands at the same time, as shown in Figure 7.2.
