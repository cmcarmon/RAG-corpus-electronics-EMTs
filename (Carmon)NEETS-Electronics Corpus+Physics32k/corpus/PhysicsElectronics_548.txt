The common drain FET ampliﬁer is similar to the common collector conﬁguration of the
bipolar transistor. A general common drain JFET ampliﬁer, self-biased, is shown in ﬁg-
ure 5.18. This conﬁguration, which is sometimes known as a source follower, is characterized
by a voltage gain of less than unity, and features a large current gain as a result of having a
very large input impedance and a small output impedance.
