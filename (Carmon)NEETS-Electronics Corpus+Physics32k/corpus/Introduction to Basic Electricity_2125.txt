The values of resistors indicated by a 
computer simulation will not precisely match 
calculated values. In the real-world the 
 resistorsâ€™ values are not carried past 1 ohm.
A real-world ammeter has some in-
ternal resistance associated with it, and 
a real-world voltmeter has some current 
flowing through it. Both of these devices 
cause the displayed values to be slightly 
different from those calculated.
