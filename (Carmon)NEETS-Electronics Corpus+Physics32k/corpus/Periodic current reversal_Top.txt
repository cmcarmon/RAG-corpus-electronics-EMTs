Periodic current reversal (PCR) is a current modulation technique that can be used in various electrochemical processes. In the most basic sense PCR simply means that the electric current applied to the cell is reversed periodically - but unlike pure AC the average (nett) current is still biased in one direction (otherwise there is no net electrochemical action).
