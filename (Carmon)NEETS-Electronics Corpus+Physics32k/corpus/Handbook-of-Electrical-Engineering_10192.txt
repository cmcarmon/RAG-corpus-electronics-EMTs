Material Handling and Machine Loading/Unloading
Applications in this category pertain to the grasping and movement of a workpart or item from one location
to another. General considerations for such applications pertain to the gripper design, distances moved, robot
weight  capacity,  the  POSE,  and  robot-dependent  issues  pertaining  to  the  conÔ¨Åguration,  degrees  of  freedom,
accuracy and precision, the controller, and programming features. POSE information is particularly important
if  there  are  no  sensors  (e.g.  vision)  to  provide  such  information  prior  to  pick-up.  Specialized  grippers  have
been designed for various applications in all three of the listed categories [Engelberger, 1980]. Quick-change
wrists enabling the robot to change grippers (or tools in processing applications) during the production cycle
have also become more common since their introduction [Vranich, 1984], as have multiple grippers mounted
turret-like  at  the  end  of  a  robotic  arm. Various  factors  need  to  be  considered  in  the  selection  and  design  of
grippers. One such checklist of factors can be found in Groover et al. [1986]. It should be noted that certain
applications may require a high degree of accuracy and precision whereas others do not. Higher requirements
result in more sophisticated drive mechanisms and controllers with associated increased costs.
