The glider design is based on a twin fuselage. NASA engineers plan to suspend the rocket stage below the center section of the glider wing. The glider will carry its own small rocket motor which will light for about 20 seconds after release from the tow plane to maintain velocity while climbing. The glider will then glide at a 70-degree angle.
