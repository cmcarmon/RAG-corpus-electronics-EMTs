In addition, in salient pole machines, there are solid con-
ducting bars in the pole faces called damper windings, or
amortisseurs windings, that inﬂuence the effective inductance.
These windings serve to damp out higher frequency oscilla-
tions. Similar effects are also seen in the cylindrical case
through eddy current ﬂows in the rotor even though damper
windings may not be present. These details are not pursued
further here.
