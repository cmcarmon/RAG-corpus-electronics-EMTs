One way of "broadening" the bandpass of a tuned circuit is to use a swamping resistor. This is
similar to the use of the swamping resistor that was shown with the series peaking coil in a video
amplifier. A swamping resistor connected in parallel with the tuned circuit will cause a much broader
bandpass. (This technique and the theory behind it are discussed in more detail in NEETS, Module 9.)
