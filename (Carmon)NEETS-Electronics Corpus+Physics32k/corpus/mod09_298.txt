If the capacitance is a fixed value, a change in the resistance value will change the phase angle. If the 
resistance could be changed to zero, we could get a maximum phase angle of 90 degrees. But since a 
voltage cannot be developed across zero resistance, a 90-degree phase shift is not possible.
