dependent  upon 
its  shape,  values  are  only 
meaningful  when  dealing  with  a  waveform  of 
known  shape.  Where  the  shape  of  a  waveform  is 
not specified, r.m.s. values are normally assumed to 
refer to sinusoidal conditions. 
  For  a  given  waveform,  a  set  of 
fixed 
relationships  exist  between  average,  peak,  peak-
peak,  and  r.m.s.  values.  The  required  multiplying 
factors are summarized for sinusoidal voltages and 
currents in Table 4.1. 
 
Example 4.4 
 
A sinusoidal voltage has an r.m.s. value of 240 V. 
What is the peak value of the voltage? 
 
Solution 
 
The  corresponding  multiplying  factor  (found  from 
Table 4.1) is 1.414. Hence: 
 
Vpk = 1.414 × Vr.m.s. = 1.414 × 240 = 339.4 V 
 
Example 4.5 
 
An alternating current has a peak-peak value of 50 
mA. What is its r.m.s. value? 
 
Solution 
 
The  corresponding  multiplying  factor  (found  from
