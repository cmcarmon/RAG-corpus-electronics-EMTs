Many perfboards come with mounting holes at the corners so that you can 
secure the board inside whatever enclosure your project provides (such as 
the chassis of a robot). If your perfboard does not have mounting holes, you 
may want to leave space at the edges of the board so you can drill holes. 
Alternatively, you can secure the board to a frame or within an enclosure 
by using double‚Äêsided foam tape. The tape cushions the board and prevents 
breakage, and the thickness of the foam prevents the underside of the board 
from touching the chassis.
