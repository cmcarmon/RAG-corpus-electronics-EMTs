A ferrite  cored  inductor  can  be  made  variable  by 
moving its core in or out of the former onto which 
the  coil  is  wound.  Many  small  inductors  have 
threaded  ferrite  cores  to  make  this  possible  (see 
Fig.  2.43).  Such  inductors  are  often  used  in  radio 
and  high-frequency  applications  where  precise 
tuning is required.
