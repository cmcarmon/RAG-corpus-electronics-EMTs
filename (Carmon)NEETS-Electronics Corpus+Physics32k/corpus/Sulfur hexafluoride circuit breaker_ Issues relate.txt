The following issues are associated with SF6 circuit breakers:
Toxic lower order gases
When an arc is formed in SF6 gas small quantities of lower order gases are formed. Some of these byproducts are toxic and can cause irritation to eyes and respiratory systems. This is a concern if the interrupters are opened for maintenance or at disposal of the interrupters.
Oxygen displacement
SF6 is heavier than air, so care must be taken when entering low confined spaces due to the risk of oxygen displacement.
Greenhouse gas

SF6 is the most potent greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has evaluated. It has a global warming potential that is 23,900 times worse than CO2.
Some governments have implemented systems to monitor and control the emission of SF6 to the atmosphere.
