Mercury switches have several disadvantages:
Their relatively slow operating rate (due to the inertia of the mercury drop) makes them unsuitable for applications that require many operating cycles per second.
Glass envelopes and wire electrodes may be fragile and require flexible leads to prevent damage to the envelope.
The mercury drop forms a common electrode, so circuits are not isolated from each other in a multi-pole switch.
Their sensitivity to gravity may make them unsuitable in portable or mobile devices that can change orientation or vibrate.
Mercury compounds are highly toxic and accumulate in any food chain, so safety codes exclude mercury in many new designs.
