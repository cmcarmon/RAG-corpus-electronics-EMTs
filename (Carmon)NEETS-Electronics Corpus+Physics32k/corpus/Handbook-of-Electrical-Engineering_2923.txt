Although the digital computer has now largely supplanted the analog computer in mathematically intensive
applications, the use of inexpensive operational ampliﬁers in instrumentation applications, in pulse shaping,
in ﬁltering, and in signal processing applications in general has continued to grow. There are currently many
commercial manufacturers whose main products are high-quality op amps. This competitiveness has ensured
a marketplace featuring a wide range of relatively inexpensive devices suitable for use by electronic engineers,
physicists, chemists, biologists, and almost any discipline that requires obtaining quantitative analog data from
instrumented experiments.
