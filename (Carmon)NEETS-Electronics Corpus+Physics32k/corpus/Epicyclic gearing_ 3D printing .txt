Planetary gears have become popular in 3D printing for a few different reasons. Planetary gear boxes can provide a large gear ratio in a small, light-weight package. Some people install such gearboxes to get more accurate 3D prints by gearing-down the movement of their stepper motors.
A geared-down motor must turn farther and faster in order to produce the same output movement in the 3D printerâ€”and that is a good thing. If the stepper motor has to turn farther then it also has to take more steps to move the printer a given distance; therefore, the geared-down stepper motor has a smaller minimum step-size than the same stepper motor without a gearbox. While there are many involved factors, planetary gearboxes may help produce very high quality 3D prints.
One popular use of 3D printed planetary gear systems is as toys for children. Since herringbone gears are easy to 3D print, it has become very popular to 3D print a moving herringbone planetary gear system for teaching children how gears work. An advantage of herringbone gears is that they don't fall out of the ring and don't need a mounting plate.
