invention of the vacuum tube was particularly instrumental in the development of radio commu-
nication systems. Amplitude modulation (AM) broadcast was initiated in 1920, while frequency
modulation (FM) broadcast was developed commercially by the end of World War II. Commercial
television broadcasting began in 1936 by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation), and the
FCC (Federal Communications Commission) authorized television broadcasting Ô¨Åve years later
in the United States.
