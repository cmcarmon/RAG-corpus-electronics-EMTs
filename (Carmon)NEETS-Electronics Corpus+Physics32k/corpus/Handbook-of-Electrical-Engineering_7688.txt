Flash EEPROMs describe a family of single-transistor cell EPPROMs. Cell sizes are about half that of two-
transistor  EEPROMs,  an  important  economic  consideration.  Care  must  be  taken  that  these  cells  are  not
programmed into the depletion mode. An array of depletion mode cells would confound the read operation
by providing multiple signal paths. Programming to enhancement only thresholds can be accomplished by a
sequence  of  partial  program  and  then  monitor  subcycles,  until  the  threshold  is  brought  to  compliance  with
speciÔ¨Åcation limits. Flash EEPROMs require bulk erasure of large portions of the array.
