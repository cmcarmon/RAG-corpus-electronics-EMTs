where K and all of the T are constants, the exponent of s, i.e., q, in the denominator represents
the number of integrations in the open loop, and the exponent q deﬁnes the system type. With q
= 0, 1, or 2, the system is classiﬁed as position, velocity, or acceleration system, respectively.
Table 16.2.2 summarizes the error response for different unit inputs and three system types. The
development of these results is left as Problem 16.2.32 at the end of this chapter.
