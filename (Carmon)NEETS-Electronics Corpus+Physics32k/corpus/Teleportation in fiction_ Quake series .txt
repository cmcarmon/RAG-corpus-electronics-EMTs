In Quake 1 teleportation is used to bridge between levels. The teleporters resemble a door frame and are filled with a surface of wobbling stars. They are called 'Slipgates'. In Quake III Arena teleporters are used casually as shortcuts and gameplay element. The target of a teleporter being a specific and marked place elsewhere in the map. In the occurrence of a player standing on this very spot when another player uses the teleporter, the player occupying the 'landing zone' explodes into parts when the unwilling aggressor emerges. Indeed, it is through this mechanic that the player defeats the final boss of the first Quake. Additionally a player also has to be careful when using a teleporter, since the target zone can be ridden with anticipatory projectiles. In Quake 4 the teleporter mechanic can also be used to transport projectiles, allowing for greater attack and defense options.
