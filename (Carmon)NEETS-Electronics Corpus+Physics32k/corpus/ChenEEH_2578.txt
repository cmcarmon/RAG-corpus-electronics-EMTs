Figure 7.30 shows some ﬁeld proﬁles of the principal modes
for the cylindrical dielectric resonator suspended between two
metallic plates and surrounded by air. In this ﬁgure, two classes
of hybrid modes are illustrated: the HEnm and EHnm modes.
The former describes a mode in which the Hl component of
the mode is dominant, whereas in the latter case, it is the Ez
component. Figure 7.31 depicts three practical techniques
commonly used to achieve magnetic coupling between a
microstrip line and a TE01d mode dielectric resonator.
