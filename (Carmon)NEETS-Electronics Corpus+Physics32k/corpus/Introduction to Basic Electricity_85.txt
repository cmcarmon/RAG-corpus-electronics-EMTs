A	circuit	analysis	technique	that	can	be	used	for	the	simplification	of	a
complicated	problem	is	the	Extra	Element	Theory;	it	was	proposed	by	R.D.
Middlebrook.	The	idea	behind	it	is	to	take	a	complex	matter,	then	divide	it	into
small	portions;	each	of	the	small	portions	will	be	addressed.
It	follows	that	every	circuit	has	a	transfer	function	and	driving	point;	the	process	of
analyzing	a	circuit,	therefore,	can	become	easier	if	the	aforementioned	elements
are	first	identified.
In	the	Extra	Element	Theory,	unlike	in	other	circuitry	theorems,	an	element	such	as
a	capacitor	or	resistor	can	be	temporarily	removed	so	the	transfer	function	or
driving	point	can	be	determined.	Since	there	are	circuit	components	that	can
complicate	an	equation	(regardless	of	how	integral	they	are	to	a	circuit),	it	is
practical	to	set	them	aside	for	a	while;	although	they	may	be	of	value	to	a	circuit	as
a	whole,	it	was	proven	that	they	donâ€™t	affect	calculations.	Once	the	initial	goal	is
achieved,	the	elements	can	be	returned.
Impedance	is	a	familiar	term	in	discussions	of	the	Extra	Element	Theory;	it	can	be
analyzed	with	the	employment	of	the	theory.	In	certain	cases,	its	input	can	be
determined	in	network	granted	that	an	extra	element	joins	in.
