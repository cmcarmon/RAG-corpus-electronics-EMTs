A 
  occurs  when  a  system  or  component  does  not  perform  as  expected.  Examples  of  failures  at  the
component level could be a base-emitter short in a transistor somewhere within a large integrated circuit or a
solder joint going open circuit because of vibrations. If a component experiences a failure, it may cause a fault,
leading to an error, which may lead to a system failure.
