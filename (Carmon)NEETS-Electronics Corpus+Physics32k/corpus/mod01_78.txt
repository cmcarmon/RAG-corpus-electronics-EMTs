The difference between the atoms, insofar as their chemical activity and stability are concerned, is
dependent upon the number and position of the electrons included within the atom. How are these
electrons positioned within the atom? In general, the electrons reside in groups of orbits called shells.
These shells are elliptically shaped and are assumed to be located at fixed intervals. Thus, the shells are
arranged in steps that correspond to fixed energy levels. The shells, and the number of electrons required
to fill them, may be predicted by the employment of Pauliâ€™s exclusion principle. Simply stated, this
principle specifies that each shell will contain a maximum of 2n2electrons, where n corresponds to the
shell number starting with the one closest to the nucleus. By this principle, the second shell, for example,
would contain 2(2) 2 or 8 electrons when full.
