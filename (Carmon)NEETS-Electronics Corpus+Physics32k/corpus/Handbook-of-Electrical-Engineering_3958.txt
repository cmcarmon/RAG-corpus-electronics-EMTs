Attenuators
Attenuators reduce the level of a signal traveling along a transmission line. The basic construction is to make
the line lossy but with a characteristic impedance approximating that of the connecting lines so as to reduce
reï¬‚ections.  The  line  is  made  lossy  by  introducing  a  resistive  vane  in  the  case  of  a  waveguide  [Fig. 39.5(d)],
replacing part of the outer conductor of a coaxial line by resistive material [Fig. 39.5(e)], or covering the line
by resistive material in the case of a microstrip line [Fig. 39.5(f)]. If the amount of lossy material introduced
into the transmission line is controlled, a variable attenuator is achieved, e.g., Fig. 39.5(d).
