Proprietary Models. A number of other models are available from commercial circuit simulator vendors, the
literature, etc. Some circuit simulators also offer the ability to add a researcher’s own models. In general, we
caution against using proprietary models, especially those which are supplied without source code and complete
documentation. Without an intimate knowledge of the model equations, it is very difﬁcult to develop a good
device characterization strategy. Also, incorporating such models into device characterization software is almost
impossible.  To  circumvent  this  problem,  many  characterization  programs  have  the  ability  to  call  the  entire
circuit simulator as a subroutine in order to exercise the proprietary model subroutines. This can slow program
execution by a factor of 20 or more, seriously impacting the time required to characterize a technology. Also,
if proprietary models are used without source code, the circuit simulator results can never be checked against
other circuit simulators. Therefore, we want to stress the importance of using standard models. If these do not
meet the individual requirements, the next best approach is to incorporate a proprietary model whose source
code one has access to. This requires being able to add the individual model not only to circuit simulators, but
also to device characterization programs; it can become a very large task.
