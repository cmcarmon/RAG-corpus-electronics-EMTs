The Boltzmann equation can be used to derive the fluid dynamic conservation laws for mass, charge, momentum and energy. For a fluid consisting of only one kind of particle, the number density n is given by




n
=
∫
f


d

3


p
.


{\displaystyle n=\int f\,d^{3}p.}

The average value of any function A is




⟨
A
⟩
=


1
n


∫
A
f


d

3


p
.


{\displaystyle \langle A\rangle ={\frac {1}{n}}\int Af\,d^{3}p.}

Since the conservation equations involve tensors, the Einstein summation convention will be used where repeated indices in a product indicate summation over those indices. Thus




x

↦

x

i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \mapsto x_{i}}
and




p

↦

p

i


=
m

w

i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \mapsto p_{i}=mw_{i}}
, where




w

i




{\displaystyle w_{i}}
is the particle velocity vector. Define



g
(

p

i


)


{\displaystyle g(p_{i})}
as some function of momentum




p

i




{\displaystyle p_{i}}
only, which is conserved in a collision. Assume also that the force




F

i




{\displaystyle F_{i}}
is a function of position only, and that f is zero for




p

i


→
±
∞


{\displaystyle p_{i}\to \pm \infty }
. Multiplying the Boltzmann equation by g and integrating over momentum yields four terms, which, using integration by parts, can be expressed as
