Spatial  and  Temporal  Coherence.
Spatial  coherence  describes  the  phase  front  properties  of  light.  A  beam
from a single-mode laser which has one well-deﬁned phase front is fully spatially coherent. A collection of light
waves from a number of light emitters is incoherent because the resulting phase front has a randomly indeﬁnable
form. Temporal coherence describes the frequency properties of light. A single-frequency laser output is fully
temporally  coherent. White  light,  which  contains  many  frequency  components,  is  incoherent,  and  a  narrow
band of frequencies is partially coherent.
