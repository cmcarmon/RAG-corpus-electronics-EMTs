Dispersion and Pulse Spreading
Dispersion refers to the variation of velocity with frequency or wavelength. Dispersion causes pulse spreading,
but other nonwavelength-dependent mechanisms also contribute to pulse spreading in optical waveguides. The
mechanisms  responsible  for  pulse  spreading  in  optical  waveguides  include  material  dispersion,  waveguide
dispersion, and multimode pulse spreading.
