The cost models can be based on area or power. Using both
the models provides a clear trade-off in the power, area, and
performance design space. In this section, we focus on the
(cost) consideration and optimization freedom of all the
three axes (Subsection 2.5.1). Moreover, the effective use of
the trade-off is shown in Subsection 2.5.2. These trade-offs will
be illustrated with real examples.
