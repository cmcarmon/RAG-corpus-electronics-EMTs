Abstraction releases the HLL designer from the bounds of a physical machine. A HLL can adopt a metaphor
or  arbitrary  model  of  the  world.  Such  unfettered  languages  provide  a  new  interface  between  human  and
computer, allowing the human to use the machine in novel and powerful ways. Abstractions rooted in logic,
symbolic manipulation, database processing, or operating systems, instead of the instruction set of a central
processing unit (CPU), open the engineering world to new horizons. Thus, the power of computers depends
on the expressiveness of HLLs.
