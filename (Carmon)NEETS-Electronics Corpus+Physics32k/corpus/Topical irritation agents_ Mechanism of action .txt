Revulsive action – in CNS interfere 2 flows of excitation: from affected viscera and from the surface of the skin; and visceral afferences decrease in intensity.
Amelioration of trophic status – due to cutaneo-visceral reflexes and histamine release the skin becomes hyperemic (reflectory dilation of arterioles and capillaries due to axon reflexes) and edematous (vasodilation and increase of permeability due to histamine release).
