For the prediction of mixture properties it is in most cases not sufficient to use a purely additive method. Instead the property is determined from group interaction parameters.




P

=

f
(

G

i
j


)


{\displaystyle P\,=\,f(G_{ij})}

where P stands for property and Gij for group interaction value.
A typical group contribution method using group interaction values is the UNIFAC method which estimates activity coefficients. A big disadvantage of the group interaction model is the need for many more model parameters. Where a simple additive model only needs ten parameters for ten groups a group interaction model needs already 45 parameters. Therefore, a group interaction model has normally not parameter for all possible combinations.
