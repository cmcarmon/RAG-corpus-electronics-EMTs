Pulse modulation has many applications in the transmission of intelligence information. In telemetry,
for example, the width of successive pulses may tell us humidity; the changing of the rest time may tell us
pressure. In other applications, as you will see later in this text, the changing of the average power can
provide us with intelligence information.
