To determine the remaining bias voltages in the amplifier, we set vin = 0 V, which
results in v IN = 0 V. From the results of Example 7.12, we can then determine the bias
voltages VOUT = 6.4 V and VGS = 1.6 V.
Next, following the method of Section 8.2, we construct the small-signal circuit model
shown in Figure 8.41. Analyzing the small-signal circuit model, we obtain
