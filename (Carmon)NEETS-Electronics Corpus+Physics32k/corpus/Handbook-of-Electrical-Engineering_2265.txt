a-Si can also be affected by light and strong ﬁeld effects. The a-Si is used in applications that require deposition
of  thin-ﬁlm  semiconductors  over  large  areas  [xerography,  solar  cells,  thin-ﬁlm  transistors  (TFT)  for  liquid-
crystal displays]. The a-Si device performance degrades with time under electric stress (TFTs) or under illu-
mination (Staebler–Wronski effect) because of the creation of new localized states.
