In equation (2) for hyperbolic motion, the expression



x


{\displaystyle x}
was constant, whereas the rapidity



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
was variable. However, as pointed out by Sommerfeld, one can define



x


{\displaystyle x}
as a variable, while making



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
constant. This means, that the equations become transformations indicating the simultaneous rest shape of an accelerated body with hyperbolic coordinates

By means of this transformation, the proper time becomes the time of the hyperbolically accelerated frame. These coordinates, which are commonly called Rindler coordinates (similar variants are called Kottler-Møller coordinates or Lass coordinates), can be seen as a special case of Fermi coordinates or Proper coordinates, and are often used in connection with the Unruh effect. Using these coordinates, it turns out that an observer in hyperbolic motion possesses an apparent event horizon, beyond which no signal can reach him.
