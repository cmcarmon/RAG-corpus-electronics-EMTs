Because the surface of the material is now electrically charged, either negatively or positively, any contact with an uncharged conductive object or with an object having substantially different charge may cause an electrical discharge of the built-up static electricity: a spark. A person simply walking across a carpet, removing a nylon shirt or rubbing against a car seat can also create a potential difference of many thousands of volts, which is enough to cause a spark one centimeter long or more.
Electrostatic discharge may not be evident in humid climates because surface condensation normally prevents triboelectric charging, while increased humidity increases the electrical conductivity of the air.
Electrostatic discharges (other than lightning which comes from triboelectric charging or ice and water droplets within clouds) cause minimal harm because the energy (1/2V2C) of the spark is very small, being typically several tens of micro joules in cold dry weather, and much less than that in humid conditions; however, such sparks can ignite flammable vapors, see risks and counter-measures. This is not the case when the capacitance of one of the objects is very large.
