Figure 24.25(c) gives the standard symbol for the npn transistor, and diagram (d) deﬁnes the direction of
current ﬂow and the voltage polarities observed when the device is in operation. Finally, diagram (e) shows
that for the pnp transistor, all these directions are reversed and the polarities are inverted.
