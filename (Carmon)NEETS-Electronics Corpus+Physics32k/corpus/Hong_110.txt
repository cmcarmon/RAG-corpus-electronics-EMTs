Figure 8.6 shows how the voltage offset can be accomplished using an inverting 
amplifier. The positive input is now connected to a reference voltage instead of ground. 
The  transfer  function  will  now  need  to  be  re-evaluated  with  the  non-zero  reference 
voltage factored in. The output is
