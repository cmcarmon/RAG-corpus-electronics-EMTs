The conservation equations for vertical momentum, heat and salinity equations (under Boussinesq’s approximation) have following form for double diffusive salt fingers:

Where, U and W are velocity components in horizontal (x axis) and vertical (z axis) direction; k is the unit vector in the Z-direction, kT is molecular diffusivity of heat, ks is molecular diffusivity of salt, α is coefficient of thermal expansion at constant pressure and salinity and β is the coefficient of saline expansion at constant pressure and temperature. The above set of conservation equations governing the two-dimensional finger-convection system is non-dimensionalised using the following scaling: the depth of the total layer height H is chosen as the characteristic length, velocity (U, W), salinity (S), temperature (T) and time (t) are non-dimensionalised as

Where, (TT, ST) and (TB, SB) are the temperature and concentration of the top and bottom layers respectively. On introducing the above non-dimensional variables, the above governing equations reduce to the following form:

Figure 1(a-d) shows the evolution of salt fingers in heat-salt system for different Rayleigh numbers at a fixed Rρ. It can be noticed that thin and thick fingers form at different RaT. Fingers flux ratio, growth rate, kinetic energy, evolution pattern, finger width etc. are found to be the function of Rayleigh numbers and Rρ.Where, flux ratio is another important non-dimensional parameter. It is the ratio of heat and salinity fluxes, defined as,
