You read in this chapter that an antenna is able to both transmit and receive electromagnetic energy. 
This is known as RECIPROCITY. Antenna reciprocity is possible because antenna characteristics are 
essentially the same regardless of whether an antenna is transmitting or receiving electromagnetic energy. 
Reciprocity allows most radar and communications systems to operate with only one antenna. An 
automatic switch, called a DUPLEXER, connects either the transmitter or the receiver to the antenna at 
the proper time. Duplexer operation will be explained in later NEETS modules dealing with radar and 
communications systems. Because of the reciprocity of antennas, this chapter will discuss antennas from 
the viewpoint of the transmitting cycle. However, you should understand that the same principles apply 
on the receiving cycle.
