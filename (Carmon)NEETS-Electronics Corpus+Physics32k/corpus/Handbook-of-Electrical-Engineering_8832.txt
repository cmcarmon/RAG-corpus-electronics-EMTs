An  implementation  based  on  these  axioms  amounts  to  representing  a  function  as  a  list  of  those  of  its
individual  mappings  that  differ  from  default  and  leads  to  an  O(1)  performance  for  update  and  an  O(n)
performance of apply. Better is an implementation by binary searchtrees with a performance of O(log(n)) for
both apply and update.
