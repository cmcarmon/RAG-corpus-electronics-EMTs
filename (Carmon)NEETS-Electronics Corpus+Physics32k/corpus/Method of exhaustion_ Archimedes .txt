Archimedes used the method of exhaustion as a way to compute the area inside a circle by filling the circle with a polygon of a greater area and greater number of sides. The quotient formed by the area of this polygon divided by the square of the circle radius can be made arbitrarily close to π as the number of polygon sides becomes large, proving that the area inside the circle of radius r is πr2, π being defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter (C/d) or of the area of the circle to the square of its radius (A/r²).
He also provided the bounds 3 + 10/71 < π < 3 + 10/70, (giving a range of 1/497) by comparing the perimeters of the circle with the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed 96-sided regular polygons.
Other results he obtained with the method of exhaustion included
The area bounded by the intersection of a line and a parabola is 4/3 that of the triangle having the same base and height;
The area of an ellipse is proportional to a rectangle having sides equal to its major and minor axes;
The volume of a sphere is 4 times that of a cone having a base of the same radius and height equal to this radius;
The volume of a cylinder having a height equal to its diameter is 3/2 that of a sphere having the same diameter;
The area bounded by one spiral rotation and a line is 1/3 that of the circle having a radius equal to the line segment length;
Use of the method of exhaustion also led to the successful evaluation of an infinite geometric series (for the first time).
