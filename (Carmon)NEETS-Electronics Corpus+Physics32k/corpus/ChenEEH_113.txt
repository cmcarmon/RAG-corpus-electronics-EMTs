This completes the cutset method of network analysis.
The following discussion illustrates the loop and cutset
methods of analysis on the network shown in Figure 2.9(A).
The graph of
shown in Figure 2.9(B).
The chosen spanning tree T consists of edges 4, 5 and 6.
Note that T contains the voltage source and has no current
source. The fundamental circuit and the fundamental cutset
matrices with respect to T are given below in the required
partioned form:
