As the temperature increases, the valence  electrons 
become agitated. Some of the electrons break the 
 covalent bonds and drift randomly from one atom to 
the next. These free electrons are able to carry a small 
amount of electrical current if an electrical voltage is 
applied. At room temperature, enough heat energy is 
available to produce a small number of free electrons  
and to support a small amount of current. As the tem-
perature increases, the material begins to acquire the 
characteristics of a conductor. Only at extremely high 
temperatures does silicon conduct current as ordinary 
conductors do. Typically, such high temperatures are 
not encountered under normal usage.
