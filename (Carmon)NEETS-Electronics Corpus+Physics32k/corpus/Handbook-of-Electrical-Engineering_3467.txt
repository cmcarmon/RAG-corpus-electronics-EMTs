In the thermal design of electronic equipment, frequent use is made of heat sinks, involving ﬁnned or extended
surfaces (Kraus and Bar-Cohen, 1995). While such ﬁnning can substantially increase the surface area in contact
with the coolant, conduction in the thermal ﬁn reduces the average temperature of the exposed surface relative
