Although the capacitance value may be printed on the body of a capacitor, it may also be indicated by a
color code. The color code used to represent capacitance values is similar to that used to represent resistance
values. The color codes currently in use are the Joint Army-Navy (JAN) code and the Radio Manufacturersâ€™
Association (RMA) code.
