with  the  A’s  accounting  for  computation  of  the  time-domain  terms  equivalent  to  their  frequency-domain
counterparts (with different numerical values), and r accounting for the RHS dependency. Although a direct
matrix may require solution initially before time-stepping the model, that is normally avoided by using dt £
