Beta decay generally causes isotopes to decay toward the isobar with the lowest mass (highest binding energy) with the same mass number, those not in italics in the table above. Thus, those with lower atomic number and higher neutron number than the minimum-mass isobar undergo beta-minus decay, while those with higher atomic number and lower neutron number undergo beta-plus decay or electron capture. However, there are four nuclides that are exceptions, in that the majority of their decays are in the opposite direction:
