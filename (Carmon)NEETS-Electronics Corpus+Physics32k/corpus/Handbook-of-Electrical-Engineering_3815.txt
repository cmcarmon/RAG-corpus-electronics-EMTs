Waveguides  are  also  available  in  a  number  of  constructions,  including  rigid,  semirigid,  and  ﬂexible.  In
applications where it is not necessary for the waveguide to bend, rigid construction is always the best since it
exhibits the lowest loss. In general, the more ﬂexible the waveguide construction, the higher the loss.
