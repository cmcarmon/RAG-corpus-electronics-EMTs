Bode diagrams are graphical representations of the frequency
responses and are used in solving design problems. Magnitude
and phase functions are shown on separate graphs using
logarithmic frequency scale along the x-axis. Logarithm of
the frequency to base 10 is used for the x-axis of a graph.
Zero frequency will correspond to negative inÔ¨Ånity on the
logarithmic scale and will not show on the plots. The x-axis
is graduated in log10 v and so every decade of frequency
(e.g., . . . 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, . . . ) is equally spaced on
the x-axis.
