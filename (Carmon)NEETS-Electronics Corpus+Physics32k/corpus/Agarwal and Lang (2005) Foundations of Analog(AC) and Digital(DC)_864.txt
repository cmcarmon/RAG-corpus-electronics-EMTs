In any VLSI technology, there is a minimum fabricatable value for the MOSFET
channel length. Clearly, smaller dimensions mean that a VLSI chip of a given
size can hold more logic. As we shall see later, smaller dimensions also result in
higher speeds of operation. VLSI technologies are characterized by this mini-
mum channel length. For example, a 0.2-µm process yields gate lengths in the
vicinity of L = 0.2 µm. Historically, technologists have been able to decrease
gate lengths by about a factor of two every four years over the past two decades.
See Table 6.2 for the scaling factors observed by the authors in projects in which
they were involved, and Figure 6.38 for a cross-sectional view of Intel’s 0.13 µm
