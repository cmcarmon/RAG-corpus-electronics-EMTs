Waveguide modes are most easily determined by ﬁrst computing the longitudinal ﬁeld components, Ez and
Hz , that can be supported by the waveguide. From these, the transverse components (such as Ex and Ey) can
easily be found simply by taking spatial derivatives of the longitudinal ﬁelds [Collin, 1992].
