Often a circuit requires a power supply that provides negative voltage as well as positive
voltage. By reversing the direction of the diode and the capacitor (if it is polarized), the
half-wave rectiﬁcation circuit with low-pass ﬁlter provides a negative voltage. Similarly,
reversing the direction of the diodes and capacitor in the full-wave rectiﬁed supply produces
a negative voltage supply. A split power supply is shown in ﬁgure 4.9.
