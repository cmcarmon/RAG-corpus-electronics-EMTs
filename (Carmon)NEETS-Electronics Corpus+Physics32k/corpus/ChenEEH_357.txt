built-in potential of the junction. The depletion regions are
wider at the drain end due to the large positive bias applied to
the drain terminal. Figure 3.20(A) corresponds to the linear
region of the JFET. Even though the channel depth is reduced
at the drain end, the n-type channel extends from the source to
the drain. The channel resembles a resistor, and the current is a
linear function of the drain bias. The depth and, hence, the
resistance of the channel is modulated by the gate bias. The
drain current in the linear region can be expressed as:
