Method 1
For the expansion of F(z) into a series, the theory of functions of a complex variable provides a practical basis
for  developing  our  inverse  transform  techniques.  As  we  have  seen,  the  general  region  of  convergence  for  a
transform function F(z) is of the form a < * z* < b, i.e., an annulus centered at the origin of the z-plane. This
ﬁrst method is to obtain a series expression of the form
