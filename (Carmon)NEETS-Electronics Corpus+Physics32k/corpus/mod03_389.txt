Selective tripping would have CB1 rated as long time delay, CB2 and CB3 rated as short time delay,
and CB4 through CB10 rated as instantaneous. With this arrangement, if load 5 had an overload, only
CB8 would trip. CB8 would remove the power from load 5 before CB1 or CB3 could react to the
overload. In this way, only load 5 would be affected and the other circuits would continue to operate.
