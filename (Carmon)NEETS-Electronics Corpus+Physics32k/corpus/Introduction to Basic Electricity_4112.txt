A shunt clipping circuit performs the same func-
tion as the series clipper (Figure 40-21). The difference 
is that the output is taken across the diode. This cir-
cuit clips off the negative portion of the input signal. 
Figure 40-22 shows the effect of reversing the diode. A 
shunt clipper can also be biased to change the clipping 
level, as shown in Figure 40-23 and Figure 40-24.
