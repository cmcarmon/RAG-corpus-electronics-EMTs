Where  analogue  quantities  (rather  than  simple 
digital on/off operation) are required at the output a 
digital-to-analogue  converter 
(DAC)  will  be 
needed. All of the functions associated with a DAC 
can  be  provided  by  a  single  integrated  circuit.  As 
with  an  ADC,  the  output  resolution  of  a  DAC 
depends on the  number of bits and 8, 10, and 12-
bits are common in control applications.

Finally,  where  input  and  output  signals  are  not 
logic  compatible  (i.e.  when  they  are  outside  the 
range  of  signals  that  can  be  connected  directly  to
