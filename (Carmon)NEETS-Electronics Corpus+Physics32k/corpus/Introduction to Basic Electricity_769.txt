Electronic engineers and researchers use Multi-
sim for schematic capture, SPICE simulation, and 
circuit design. Multisim is used to identify errors, 
confirm circuit designs, and build faster prototypes. 
Schematics are then transferred to NI ultiboard lay-
out to prototype completed PCBs. Ultiboard enables 
engineers to integrate design and test with a single, 
unified software platform that includes NI Multisim 
and NI LabVIEW. Design engineers can now easily 
compare simulated and real-world measurements to 
benchmark performance, resulting in fewer design 
problems.
