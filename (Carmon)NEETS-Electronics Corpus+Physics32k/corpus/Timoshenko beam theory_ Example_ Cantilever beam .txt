For a cantilever beam, one boundary is clamped while the other is free. Let us use a right handed coordinate system where the



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction is positive towards right and the



z


{\displaystyle z}
direction is positive upward. Following normal convention, we assume that positive forces act in the positive directions of the



x


{\displaystyle x}
and



z


{\displaystyle z}
axes and positive moments act in the clockwise direction. We also assume that the sign convention of the stress resultants (




M

x
x




{\displaystyle M_{xx}}
and




Q

x




{\displaystyle Q_{x}}
) is such that positive bending moments compress the material at the bottom of the beam (lower



z


{\displaystyle z}
coordinates) and positive shear forces rotate the beam in a counterclockwise direction.
Let us assume that the clamped end is at



x
=
L


{\displaystyle x=L}
and the free end is at



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}
. If a point load



P


{\displaystyle P}
is applied to the free end in the positive



z


{\displaystyle z}
direction, a free body diagram of the beam gives us

{\displaystyle P+Q_{x}=0\implies Q_{x}=-P\,.}

Therefore, from the expressions for the bending moment and shear force, we have

{\displaystyle Px=EI\,{\frac {d\varphi }{dx}}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad -P=\kappa AG\left(-\varphi +{\frac {dw}{dx}}\right)\,.}

Integration of the first equation, and application of the boundary condition



φ
=
0


{\displaystyle \varphi =0}
at



x
=

{\displaystyle x=L}
, leads to

{\displaystyle w=0}
at



x

{\displaystyle x=L}
gives
