To  solve  this  problem  and  retain  the  advantage  of  the  method,  a  new  algorithm  is  presented  [21].  It  is  to
precluster  the  training  speakers  acoustically  into  clusters.  For  each  cluster,  an  HMM  system  (called  a  cluster-
dependent system) is trained using speech data from the speakers who belong to the cluster. When a test speaker’s
data is available, we rank these cluster-dependent systems according to the distances between the test speaker
and each cluster, and a subset of these clusters, acoustically closest to the test speaker, is chosen. Then the model
for each of the selected clusters is transformed further to bring the model closer to the test speaker’s acoustic
space. Finally, these adapted cluster models are combined to form a speaker-adapted system. Hence, compared
to  [22],  we  now  choose  clusters  that  are  acoustically  close  to  the  test  speaker,  rather  than  individual  training
speakers.
