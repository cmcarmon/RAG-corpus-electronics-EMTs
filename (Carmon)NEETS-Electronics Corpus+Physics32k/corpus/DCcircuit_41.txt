The electrons of different types of atoms have different degrees of freedom to move around.
With some types of materials, such as metals, the outermost electrons in the atoms are so
loosely bound that they chaotically move in the space between the atoms of that material by
nothing more than the inﬂuence of room-temperature heat energy. Because these virtually un-
bound electrons are free to leave their respective atoms and ﬂoat around in the space between
adjacent atoms, they are often called free electrons.
