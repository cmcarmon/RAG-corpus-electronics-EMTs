At zero VAR demand, the capacitive and reactive VARs cancel out, but the capacitor bank’s current is circulated
through the reactor bank via the thyristor switch. As a result, this conﬁguration suffers from no load (standby)
losses. The losses decrease with increasing the capacitive VAR output and, conversely, increase with increasing
the inductive VAR output.
