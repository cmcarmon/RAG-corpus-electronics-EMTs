A  simpliﬁed  torque-speed  curve  is  shown  in  Fig.  66.12.  The  torque  capability  is  constant  up  to  the  base
speed of the motor while the armature and ﬁeld currents are held constant. The speed is controlled by armature
voltage in this range. Operation above base speed is accomplished by reducing the ﬁeld current. This is called
ﬁeld weakening. The motor operates at constant power in this range, and the torque reduces with increasing
speed.
