According to Thevenin’s theorem, the linear circuit in Fig. 4.23(a)
can be replaced by that in Fig. 4.23(b). (The load in Fig. 4.23 may be
a  single  resistor  or  another  circuit.)  The  circuit  to  the  left  of  the  ter-
minals 
in Fig. 4.23(b) is known as the Thevenin equivalent circuit;
it was developed in 1883 by M. Leon Thevenin (1857–1926), a French
telegraph engineer.
