North  American  low-voltage  distribution  fuses  can  be  classiﬁed  under  two  types:  Standard  or  Class  H,  as
referred to in the United States, and HRC (high rupturing capacity) or current-limiting fuses, as referred to
in Canada. It is the interrupting rating that essentially differentiates one type from the other.
