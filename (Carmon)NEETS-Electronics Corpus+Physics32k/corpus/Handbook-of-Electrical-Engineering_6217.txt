Frequency Allocations
The 100 carrier frequencies for FM broadcast range from 88.1 to 107.9 MHz and are equally spaced every 200
kHz. The channels from 88.1 to 91.9 MHz are reserved for educational and noncommercial broadcasting and
those  from  92.1  to  107.9 MHz  for  commercial  broadcasting.  Each  channel  has  a  200-kHz  bandwidth.  The
maximum frequency swing under normal conditions is –75 kHz. Stations operating with an SCA may under
certain conditions exceed this level, but in no event may exceed a frequency swing of –82.5 kHz. The carrier
frequency is required to be maintained within –2000 Hz. The frequencies used for FM broadcasting generally
limit the coverage to the line-of-sight or a slightly greater distance. The actual coverage area is determined by
the ERP of the station and the height of the transmitting antenna above the average terrain in the area. Either
increasing the power or raising the antenna will increase the coverage area.
