The BBO equation, in the formulation as given by Zhu & Fan (1998, pp. 18–27) and Soo (1990), pertains to a small spherical particle of diameter

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {u}}_{f}.}
For very small particle diameter the latter is locally a constant whose value is given by the undisturbed Eulerian field evaluated at the location of the particle center,

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {U}}_{f}(t)={\boldsymbol {u}}_{f}({\boldsymbol {X}}_{p}(t),t)}
. The small particle size also implies that the disturbed flow can be found in the limit of very small Reynolds number, leading to a drag force given by Stokes' drag. Unsteadiness of the flow relative to the particle results in force contributions by added mass and the Basset force. The BBO equation states:

This is Newton's second law, in which the left-hand side is the rate of change of the particle's linear momentum, and the right-hand side is the summation of forces acting on the particle. The terms on the right-hand side are, respectively, the:
Stokes' drag,
Froude–Krylov force due to the pressure gradient in the undisturbed flow, with
