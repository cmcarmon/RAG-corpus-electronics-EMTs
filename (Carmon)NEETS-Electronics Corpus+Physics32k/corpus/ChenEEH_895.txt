To gain additional insight into problem LCSS–SAFE, con-
sider again the circuit example used in Table 4.1. Two solutions
of problem LCSS–SAFE are listed in Table 4.2 for two different
values of the clock period, TCP ¼ 6:5 and TCP ¼ 6, respect-
ively. These results are shown—denoted by t 2
cd, respect-
ively—in columns 2 through 5 and 6 through 9 for TCP ¼ 6:5
(clock schedule t 2
cd), respect-
ively. For the speciﬁc value of TCP, the permissible range is
listed in columns 2 and 6, respectively, and the clock skew
solution is listed in columns 3 and 7, respectively.
