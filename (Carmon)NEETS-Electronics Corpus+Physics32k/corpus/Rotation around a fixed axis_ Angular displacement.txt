A particle moves in a circle of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
. Having moved an arc length



s


{\displaystyle s}
, its angular position is



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
relative to its original position, where



θ
=


s
r




{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {s}{r}}}
.
In mathematics and physics it is usual to use the natural unit radians rather than degrees or revolutions. Units are converted as follows:








1

rev




=

360

∘


=
2
π

rad, and





1

rad




=



180

∘


π


≈

57.3

∘


.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1{\text{ rev}}&=360^{\circ }=2\pi {\text{ rad, and}}\\1{\text{ rad}}&={\frac {180^{\circ }}{\pi }}\approx 57.3^{\circ }.\end{aligned}}}

An angular displacement is a change in angular position:




Δ
θ
=

θ

2


−

θ

1


,



{\displaystyle \Delta \theta =\theta _{2}-\theta _{1},\!}

where



Δ
θ


{\displaystyle \Delta \theta }
is the angular displacement,




θ

1




{\displaystyle \theta _{1}}
is the initial angular position and




θ

2




{\displaystyle \theta _{2}}
is the final angular position.
