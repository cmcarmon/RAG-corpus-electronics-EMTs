Contact clearances or gap settings must be maintained in accordance with the operational
specifications of the relay. When a relay has bent contacts, you should use a point bender (shown in figure
3-27) to straighten the contacts. The use of any other tool could cause further damage and the entire relay
would have to be replaced.
