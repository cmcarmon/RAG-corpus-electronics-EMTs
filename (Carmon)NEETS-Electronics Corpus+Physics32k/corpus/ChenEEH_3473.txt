The requirements may be divided in three categories: protect-
ing the motor from faults, avoiding thermal damage, and
sustaining abnormal operating conditions. The protection
from faults has to detect both phase and ground faults. The
thermal damage may come from an overload or locked rotor
and has to be detected by correlating the rise in the tempera-
ture to the occurrence of the excessive currents. The abnormal
operating conditions that need to be detected are unbalanced
operation, under voltage or overvoltage, reversed phases, high-
speed reclosing, unusual ambient temperature, voltage and
incomplete starting sequence.
