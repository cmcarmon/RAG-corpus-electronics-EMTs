Constant acceleration is notable for several reasons:
It is a fast form of travel. When ergonomics are considered, they are the fastest form of interplanetary and interstellar travel.
Constant acceleration creates its own artificial gravity to the benefit of passengers, who may thus be spared from having to deal with the effects of microgravity.
However, constant acceleration is an inefficient use of fuel and energy, and is not used in existing spaceflight systems.
