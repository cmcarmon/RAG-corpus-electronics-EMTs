The 3DS port of Tales of the Abyss was first announced in September 2010 during Nintendo of Japan's "Nintendo Conference" press event, along with a tentative release date of spring 2011. The following April, Namco Bandai announced that the 3DS port for Japan had been delayed and would miss its originally intended deadline, with a commercial release eventually coming the following June. In May 2011, Namco Bandai confirmed a North American release alongside Tales of Graces F for some time later that year. A European release was confirmed a few days later for a spring 2012 time-frame, which also marked the first official release of the game in the region. Namco's European branch would later feature the game at the 2011 Gamescom event in Germany.
The port made use of the handheld's 3D and dual screen capabilities, including the ability to register combat skills on the bottom screen for quick access, which is replaced by a world map while outside battle. Artist Kousuke Fujishima, who had worked on the previous version of the game, provided a new title logo graphic and promotional character art for the release. In addition, the Japanese version includes the new Mystic Arte attacks added to the original North American PlayStation 2 version.
