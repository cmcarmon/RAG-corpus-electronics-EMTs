The models are subdivided in two ways. The whole system is
partitioned into smaller entities that are modeled as a unit;
furthermore, there are several models (i.e., entities, which are
each modeled as a unit; furthermore, there are several models
(i.e., architectures) for each unit. These architectures differ in
terms of abstraction levels and exactness or represent differ-
ent implementation approaches. The architectures suited for
system simulation are presented in the following.
