The most common materials used for crystals are 
Rochelle salt, tourmaline, and quartz. Rochelle salt 
has the most electrical activity, but it fractures easily. 
Tourmaline has the least electrical activity, but it is the 
strongest. Quartz is a compromise: It has good elec-
trical activity and is strong. Quartz is the most com-
monly used crystal in oscillator circuits.
