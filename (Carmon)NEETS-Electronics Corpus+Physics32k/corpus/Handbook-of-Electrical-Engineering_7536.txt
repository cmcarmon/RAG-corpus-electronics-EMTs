A low value of speed-power product is desirable to implement high-speed (and, therefore, low propagation
delay time) switching devices that consume low amounts of power. Because of the nature of transistor switching
circuits, it is difÔ¨Åcult to attain high-speed switching with low power dissipation. The continued development
of  new  IC  logic  families  and  subfamilies  is  largely  due  to  the  trade-offs  between  these  two  device  switching
parameters. The speed-power product for various subfamilies is also compared in Table 79.5.
