Note that the RHS of (Banerjee, 1986) is obtained almost for
free from the Ô¨Çoating point computations aT
computed as part of the entire Ô¨Çoating point vector matrix
product aT
integer column checksum test.
The Ô¨Çoating point additions have to be tested by applying
the Ô¨Çoating point checksum tests to rowsum hB(u):¬º fB(u)
(i.e., to the Ô¨Ånal matrix product A  B) to give rise to the hybrid
test for matrix multiplication.
