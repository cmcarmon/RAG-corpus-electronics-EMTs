In general, the various properties of an antenna apply equally, regardless of whether you use the 
antenna for transmitting or receiving. The more efficient a certain antenna is for transmitting, the more 
efficient it will be for receiving on the same frequency. Likewise, the directive properties of a given 
antenna also will be the same whether it is used for transmitting or receiving.
