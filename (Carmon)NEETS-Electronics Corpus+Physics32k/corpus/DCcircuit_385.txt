The answer is to check between all combinations of those three points. As you can see,
the points are labeled ”A”, ”B”, and ”C” in the illustration, so you would need to take your
multimeter (set in the voltmeter mode) and check between points A & B, B & C, and A & C. If
you ﬁnd voltage between any of those pairs, the circuit is not in a Zero Energy State. But wait!
Remember that a multimeter will not register DC voltage when its in the AC voltage mode
and vice versa, so you need to check those three pairs of points in each mode for a total of six
voltage checks in order to be complete!
