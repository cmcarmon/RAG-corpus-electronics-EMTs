Managing various objects, such as information in disks, dis-
play monitors, and keyboards,
is an important operating
system function. To hide peculiarities of these objects, the
operating system presents the programmer with a nice, clean
abstract model of device-independent ﬁles. A ﬁle must be
opened before it can be read, written, and closed. Therefore,
system calls are needed to create, remove, open, read, write,
and close ﬁles.
