as in the case of the Y/Y transformer. However, harmonics of order 5, 7, 17, 19, etc. are in phase opposition,
whereas harmonics of order 11, 13, 23, 25, etc. are in phase with the Y/Y transformer case. Hence harmonics
of order 5, 7, 17, 19, etc. will be canceled in a 12-pulse converter and do not appear in the ac system. In practice
they will not be canceled completely because of imbalances in converter and transformer parameters.
