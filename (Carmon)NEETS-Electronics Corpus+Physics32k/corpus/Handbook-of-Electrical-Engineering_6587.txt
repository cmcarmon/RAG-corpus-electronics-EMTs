where D is the propagation delay, c/n is the (group) velocity of bits on the transmission line, and c is the velocity
of light, optical ﬁber may be preferable to copper. For optical ﬁbers, with refractive index n = 1.5, the delay is
n/c = 5 · 10–9 s/m = 5 ms/km. Thus, with BL = 100 Mb/ s·km, M is 500 bits, i.e., there are 500 bits in transit on
the transmission line between transmitter and receiver.
