Some fuses and fuseholders have built-in indicators to show when a fuse is open. Examples of these
open-fuse indicators are shown in figure 2-13. Figure 2-13, view A, shows a cartridge-type fuse with an
open-fuse indicator. The indicator is spring loaded and held by the fuse link. If the fuse link opens, the
spring forces the indicator out. Some manufacturers color the indicator so it is easier to see in the
open-fuse position.
