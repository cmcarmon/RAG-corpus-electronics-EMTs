If you want to explore further, try replacing R1 and R2 with different resis-
tances or use a different capacitor. Then calculate the charge/discharge times 
you expect to see and measure the actual times as you charge and discharge 
the capacitor. You’ll find that the RC time constant doesn’t disappoint!
