1995) have emerged for their control. Publications of Polycar-
pou (1996) and Polycarpou and Mears (1998) present an
extension of the tuning functions approach in which the non-
linearities of the strict feedback system are not assumed to be
parametric uncertainties but are rather completely unknown
nonlinearities to be approximated online with nonlinearly
parameterized function approximators. Both the adaptive
methods in Krstic et al. (1995) and in Polycarpou (1996) and
Polycarpou and Mears (1998) attempt to approximate the
dynamics of the plant online, so they may be classiÔ¨Åed as
indirect adaptive schemes.
