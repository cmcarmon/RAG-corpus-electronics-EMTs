Sliding Surface Construction
An appropriate sliding surface on which the system has de-
sired behavior must be constructed. Because (Ac, Bc) is con-
trollable, one can ﬁnd a feedback gain matrix K 2 RmnN such
that Ac þ Bc K is asymptotically stable. Denote As ¼ Ac þ Bc K .
Then there exists a positive deﬁnite matrix P satisfying the
Ricatti inequality:
