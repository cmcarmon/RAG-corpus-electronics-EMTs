Electronic circuits have become so intimately integrated with mechanical systems that a new term,
mechatronics, has been coined for the combination. Various subjects related to mechatronics are
being developed at a number of universities in the United States, supported by major industrial
sponsors. Too many engineers, at present, are not well equipped and trained to design mechatronic
