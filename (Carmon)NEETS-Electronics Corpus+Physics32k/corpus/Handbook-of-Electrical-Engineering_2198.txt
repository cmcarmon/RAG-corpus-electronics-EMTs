Assume that we are going to analyze the dial tones from a telephone network that uses dual-tone multifre-
quency  (DTMF)  signaling.  In  this  system,  pairs  of  tones  are  used  to  signal  each  character  on  the  telephone
keypad. For example, the digit 1 is represented by tones at 697 Hz and 1209 Hz. All of the tones are between
697 Hz and 1633 Hz. Thus, before analyzing the signal to determine the two tones that it contains, we might
want to ﬁlter out all signals outside of the band that contains all possible tones in order to increase the signal-
to-noise  ratio.  In  this  example,  we  design  a  bandpass  ﬁlter  with  a  passband  between  500  Hz  and  1800  Hz.
Designs  are  compared  using  an  elliptic  IIR  ﬁlter  of  order  8  and  a  causal  FIR  ﬁlter  of  order  70.  Figure 21.5
contains magnitude plots of the two ﬁlters, and clearly shows the characteristics of the ﬁlters. The elliptic ﬁlter
has sharp transitions with ripple in the passband and in the stopband, while the FIR ﬁlter (which also uses a
Hamming window) is ﬂat in the passband and the stopband, but has wider transition bands. Figure 21.6 contains
the group delays for the two ﬁlters. The FIR ﬁlter has a linear phase response, and thus the group delay is a
ﬁxed value of 35 samples; the IIR ﬁlter has a nonlinear phase, but has a relatively constant delay in the passband.
Figure 21.7 contains the corresponding impulse responses, illustrating the ﬁnite impulse response of the FIR
ﬁlter  and  the  inﬁnite  impulse  response  of  the  IIR  ﬁlter.  Figure 21.8  contains  the  pole/zero  plot  for  the  IIR
solution. The code for performing the designs and generating all the plots is shown in Fig. 21.9.
