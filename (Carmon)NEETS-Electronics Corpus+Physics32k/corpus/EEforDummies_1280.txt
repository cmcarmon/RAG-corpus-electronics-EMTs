Many circuit simulators are based on an industry‐standard algorithm called 
SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis); you can use 
them to simulate and analyze various circuits — analog, digital, and mixed 
signal (that is, incorporating both analog and digital). You can download a 
free evaluation copy of one such simulator, Multisym, and try it out yourself 
by visiting www.ni.com/multisim/try/.
