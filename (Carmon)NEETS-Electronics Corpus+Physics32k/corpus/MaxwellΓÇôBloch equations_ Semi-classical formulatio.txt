The derivation of the semi-classical optical Bloch equations is nearly identical to solving the two-state quantum system (see the discussion there). However, usually one casts these equations into a density matrix form. The system we are dealing with can be described by the wave function:




ψ

{\displaystyle \psi =c_{g}\psi _{g}+c_{e}\psi _{e}}

{\displaystyle \left|c_{g}\right|^{2}+\left|c_{e}\right|^{2}=1}

The density matrix is

{\displaystyle \rho ={\begin{bmatrix}\rho _{ee}&\rho _{eg}\\\rho _{ge}&\rho _{gg}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}c_{e}c_{e}^{*}&c_{e}c_{g}^{*}\\c_{g}c_{e}^{*}&c_{g}c_{g}^{*}\end{bmatrix}}}

(other conventions are possible; this follows the derivation in Metcalf (1999)). One can now solve the Heisenberg equation of motion, or translate the results from solving the Schrödinger equation into density matrix form. One arrives at the following equations, including spontaneous emission:
