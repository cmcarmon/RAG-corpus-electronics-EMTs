In string theory, tachyons have the same interpretation as in quantum field theory. However, string theory can, at least, in principle, not only describe the physics of tachyonic fields, but also predict whether such fields appear.
Tachyonic fields indeed arise in many versions of string theory. In general, string theory states that what we see as "particles" (electrons, photons, gravitons and so forth) are actually different vibrational states of the same underlying string. The mass of the particle can be deduced from the vibrations which the string exhibits; roughly speaking, the mass depends upon the "note" which the string sounds. Tachyons frequently appear in the spectrum of permissible string states, in the sense that some states have negative mass-squared, and therefore, imaginary mass. If the tachyon appears as a vibrational mode of an open string, this signals an instability of the underlying D-brane system to which the string is attached. The system will then decay to a state of closed strings and/or stable D-branes. If the tachyon is a closed string vibrational mode, this indicates an instability in spacetime itself. Generally, it is not known (or theorized) what this system will decay to. However, if the closed string tachyon is localized around a spacetime singularity, the endpoint of the decay process will often have the singularity resolved.
