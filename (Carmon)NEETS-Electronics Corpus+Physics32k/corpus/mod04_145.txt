Copper wires are usually tinned by dipping them into flux (view A of figure 2-25) and then into a 
solder bath (pot) (view B of the figure). In the field, copper wires can be tinned with a soldering iron and 
rosin-core solder. Tin the conductor for about half its exposed length. Tinning or solder on the wire above 
the barrel causes the wire to be stiff at the point where flexing takes place. This will result in the wire 
breaking.
