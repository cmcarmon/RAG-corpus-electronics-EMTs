22c MAX HOLD When activated, the digital storage memory retains the maximum signal amplitude
at each memory location. This permits visual monitoring of signal frequency and
amplitude at each memory location over an indefinite period of time. This feature
is used to measure drift, stability, and record peak amplitude.
