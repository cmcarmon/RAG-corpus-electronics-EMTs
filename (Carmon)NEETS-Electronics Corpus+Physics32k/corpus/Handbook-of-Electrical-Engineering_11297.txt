Pulse Generator
The primary function of the pulse generator is to interpret the information gained from the atrial and ventricular
electrodes  and  other  sensors  to  determine  if  the  patient  requires  pacing  and  to  deliver  the  pacing  pulses,  if
necessary. A  number  of  sophisticated  algorithms  are  applied  by  the  pacemaker  to  determine  when  pacing  is
necessary. The pulse generator also performs several secondary functions, such as telemetry and diagnostics.
A hermetically sealed titanium shell is used to house the electronics of the pulse generator because titanium is
a strong, lightweight metal that is biocompatible with human tissue and does not corrode. Figure 115.13 shows
a block diagram of a typical pacemaker pulse generator. A battery supplies the power for the electronics as well
as for the pacing pulses. The sensing circuitry is used to amplify the electrical signals that are present on the
heart in order to determine the heart rate. If rate-adaptive sensors are used (discussed below), additional sensing
circuitry is needed. The output circuitry generates the pacing pulses by storing a charge on a capacitor so it
can be delivered to the heart on demand. The backup pacing circuit is capable of asynchronously pacing either
the atria or the ventricles at a preprogrammed rate in the event of excess noise. It also serves as a rate-limiting
protection circuit to prevent the heart from being paced at an excessive rate due to a main system failure. The
pacing control consists of timing circuitry and logic sections; it is responsible for interpreting sensed data and
reacting with an appropriate pacing response. A microprocessor can be integrated with the pacing control and
is often utilized as an overall system control to allow for ï¬‚exibility of design. Memory in the form of RAM and
ROM  is  required  to  store  the  microprocessor  program,  pacing  parameters,  and  diagnostics.  The  telemetry
