For nonceramic insulators, there is actually less risk than
with the porcelain or glass insulators from the ï¬‚ashover event
itself due to the elastic nature of the material. But it is from the
surface discharge activity that the exposed insulation can be
subjected to degradation, and this can be a major concern. In
addition, the organic nature of the insulating materials can
make them vulnerable to degradation from natural elements,
such as heat, UV from sunlight, moisture, and chemicals. A
permanent reduction of their desirable properties under ser-
vice conditions can occur with time, referred to as aging. It is
also important to note that some degradation modes may
actually occur even in clean conditions, such as from exposure
to corona activity. In fact, mechanical failure of nonceramic
insulators from a mode of failure called brittle fracture has
been experienced in relatively benign outdoor conditions.
Users should be aware of all these possibilities.
