Different receiving systems may vary in the type of coupling between stages, the type of mixer, the
detector, the local oscillator, and the number of stages of amplification at the different frequencies.
However, the receiver is always designed to have as little noise as possible. It is also designed to have
sufficient gain so that noise, rather than lack of gain, limits the smallest visible signal.
