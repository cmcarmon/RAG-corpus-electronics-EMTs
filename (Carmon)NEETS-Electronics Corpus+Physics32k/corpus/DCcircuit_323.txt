Even with a good lock-out/tag-out safety program in place, there is still need for diligence
and common-sense precaution. This is especially true in industrial settings where a multitude
of people may be working on a device or system at once. Some of those people might not know
about proper lock-out/tag-out procedure, or might know about it but are too complacent to
follow it. Donâ€™t assume that everyone has followed the safety rules!
