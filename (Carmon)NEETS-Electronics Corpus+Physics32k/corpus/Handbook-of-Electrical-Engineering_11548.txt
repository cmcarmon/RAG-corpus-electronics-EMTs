Depending on the application, human body models may be crude approximations or detailed meshes based
on actual anatomy. A popular source of anatomical data suitable as the basis for an FDTD biological mesh is
the Visible Human Project of the National Library of Medicine. Various types of data are available, with the
most useful perhaps being the cross-sections. These are 1-mm slices for the male and 0.33-mm slices for the
female.  Both  have  a  cross-sectional  resolution  of  0.33  mm.  The  FDTD  meshing  of  this  data  still  requires
considerable effort, especially in assigning the colors of the slices to particular tissue types.
