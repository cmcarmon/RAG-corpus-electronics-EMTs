inability of a relay to correctly decide if it should operate in
zone 1 or zone 2 for a fault that occurs in the region close to
the set point between the zones. In this case, the relay oper-
ation may be termed as ‘‘overreaching’’ or ‘‘underreaching,’’
depending if the relay has mistaken that the fault was inside of
the selected zone while it was actually outside and vice versa.
