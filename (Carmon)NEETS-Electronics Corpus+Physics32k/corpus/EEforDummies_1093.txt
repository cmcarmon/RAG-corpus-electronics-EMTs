If you design a small circuit, you can use just half a perfboard. Before trans-
ferring the components, cut the board with a hacksaw while wearing a pro-
tective mask to avoid breathing in the dust produced by the saw. Clean the 
portion of the board that you want to use and solder away. Some preprinted 
PCBs are scored so you can simply snap the board to create two or four 
smaller boards.
