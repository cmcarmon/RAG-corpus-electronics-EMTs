The Italian Society on General Relativity and Gravitation (SIGRAV), founded in 1990 , is a non-profit association whose purpose is that of bringing together members belonging to the Italian scientific community who are interested in the various aspects of general relativity and in gravitation physics.
SIGRAV therefore brings together experts and researchers involved in classical and quantum gravity, astrophysics, relativistic cosmology and experimental gravity, organizing biennial national congresses.
Other relevant activities are managing the SIGRAV School and the Virgo School. At the time of the national congress it awards the SIGRAV prizes and the Amaldi medal.
