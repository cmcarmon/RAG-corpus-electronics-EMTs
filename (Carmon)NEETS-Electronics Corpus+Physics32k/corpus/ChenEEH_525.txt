The tnp is an average time between random collisions inter-
rupting these free electron ﬂights. The average distance that an
electron travels between two collisions is called the mean free
path. In relatively weak electric ﬁelds when the electron drift
velocity is much smaller than the thermal velocity, the mean
free path is given by:
