, the cell list algorithm listed above still has some inefficiencies.
Consider a computational cell with edge length equal to the cut-off radius




r

c




{\displaystyle r_{c}}
. The pairwise distance between all particles in the cell and in one of the neighbouring cells is computed. The cell has 26 neighbours: 6 sharing a common face, 12 sharing a common edge and 8 sharing a common corner. Of all the pairwise distances computed, only about 16% will actually be less than or equal to




r

c




{\displaystyle r_{c}}
. In other words, 84% of all pairwise distance computations are spurious.
One way of overcoming this inefficiency is to partition the domain into cells of edge length smaller than




r

c




{\displaystyle r_{c}}
. The pairwise interactions are then not just computed between neighboring cells, but between all cells within

{\displaystyle r_{c}}
of each other (first suggested in  and implemented and analysed in  and ). This approach can be taken to the limit wherein each cell holds at most one single particle, therefore reducing the number of spurious pairwise distance evaluations to zero. This gain in efficiency, however, is quickly offset by the number of cells

that need to be inspected for every interaction with a cell

, however, already reduces the number of spurious distance evaluations to 63%.
Another approach is outlined and tested in Gonnet, in which the particles are first sorted along the axis connecting the cell centers. This approach generates only about 40% spurious pairwise distance computations, yet carries an additional cost due to sorting the particles.
