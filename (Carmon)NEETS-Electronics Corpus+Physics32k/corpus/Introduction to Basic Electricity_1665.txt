A series circuit contains two or more resistors and proâ€‘
vides one path for current to flow. The current flows 
from the negative side of the voltage source through 
each resistor to the positive side of the voltage source. 
If there is only one path for current to flow between 
two points in a circuit, the circuit is a series circuit.
