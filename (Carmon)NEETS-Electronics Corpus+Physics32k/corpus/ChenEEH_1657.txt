extremely challenging task indeed. For example, a remote
sensing satellite, which generates seven band images including
three visible and four infrared spectrum regions, produces
around 5000 images per week. Each single spectral image,
which corresponds to a 170 km  185 km of the earth’s region,
requires 200 mB of storage. The amount of data originated
from satellite systems is already reaching a terabyte level per
day. Storing, indexing, and retrieving such a huge amount of
data by their contents is a very challenging task. Generally
speaking, data representation and feature-based content mod-
eling are two basic components required by the management
of any multimedia database. As far as the image database is
concerned, data representation focuses on image storage,
whereas feature-based content modeling is related to image
indexing and retrieval. Depending on the background of the
research teams, different levels of abstractions have been as-
sumed to model the data. As shown in Figure 6.6, these
abstractions can be classiﬁed into three categories based on
the gradient model of human visual perception. This ﬁgure,
also captures the mutual interaction of some disciplines of
engineering, computer science, and cognitive sciences.
