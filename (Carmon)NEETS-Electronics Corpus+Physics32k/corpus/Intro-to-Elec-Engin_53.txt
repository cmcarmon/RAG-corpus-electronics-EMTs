Although the term resistance will be formally deﬁned later, one can say qualitatively that
a conductor has a very low resistance to the ﬂow of charge, whereas an insulator has a very
high resistance to the ﬂow of charge. Charge-conducting abilities of various materials vary in
a wide range. Semiconductors fall in the middle between conductors and insulators, and have
a moderate resistance to the ﬂow of charge. Examples include silicon, germanium, and gallium
arsenide.
