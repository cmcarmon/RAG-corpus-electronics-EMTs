We will abandon the straightforward approach, and instead, cast off in a
slightly different direction. Clearly, with the given values of the drive, this is
a case where the diode is being operated only over a very restricted region of
its nonlinear v i characteristics: the diode will always have a large positive DC
offset voltage across it (given by VI), and the diode current will vary only by a
small amount around ID (as depicted in the graphical sketch in Figure 4.37) due
to the small signal vI superimposed on the DC input voltage. Thus a sensible
approach is to model the diode characteristic accurately in the vicinity of ID (as
depicted by the small straight line segment tangent to the curve at the VI, ID
point, as shown in Figure 4.37) and disregard the rest of the curve. The Taylor
Series expansion is the appropriate tool to employ for this task:
