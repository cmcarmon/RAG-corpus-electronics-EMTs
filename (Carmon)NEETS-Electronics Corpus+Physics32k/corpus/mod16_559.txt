LOW RANGE.The low range is designed to test for resistance values between 1Ω and 1K. Figure 
5-30 shows the effect of resistance on the angle of rotation in low range. A 1Ω resistor causes almost 90º  
of rotation, and a 50Ω resistor produces a 45º  rotation. A 400Ω resistor causes a very small rotation 
angle. Resistors lower than 1Ω will appear as a short circuit (vertical trace), and resistance values above 
400Ω will look like an open circuit (horizontal trace).
