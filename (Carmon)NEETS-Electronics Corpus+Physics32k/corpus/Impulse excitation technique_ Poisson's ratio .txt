The Poisson’s ratio is a measure in which a material tends to expand in directions perpendicular to the direction of compression. After measuring the Young's modulus and the shear modulus, dedicated software determines the Poisson’s ratio using Hooke’s law which can only be applied to isotropic materials according to the different standards.
