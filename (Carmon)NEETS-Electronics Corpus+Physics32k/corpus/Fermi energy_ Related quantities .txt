Using this definition of Fermi Energy, various related quantities can be useful. The Fermi temperature is defined as:





T

F


=



E

F



k

B






{\displaystyle T_{F}={\frac {E_{F}}{k_{B}}}}

where




k

B




{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is the Boltzmann constant and




E

F




{\displaystyle E_{F}}
the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics. The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature.
Other quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum and Fermi velocity:





p

F


=


2

m

e



E

F






{\displaystyle p_{F}={\sqrt {2m_{e}E_{F}}}}






v

F


=



p

F



m

e






{\displaystyle v_{F}={\frac {p_{F}}{m_{e}}}}

where




m

e




{\displaystyle m_{e}}
is the mass of the electron. These quantities are the momentum and group velocity, respectively, of a fermion at the Fermi surface. The Fermi momentum can also be described as




p

F


=
‚Ñè

k

F




{\displaystyle p_{F}=\hbar k_{F}}
, where




k

F




{\displaystyle k_{F}}
is the radius of the Fermi sphere and is called the Fermi wave vector.
These quantities are not well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical. In the case of the quadratic dispersion relations given above, they are given by:
