Channel: The  conducting  region  in  a  MOSFET  between  source  and  drain.  In  an  enhancement-mode  (or
normally off) MOSFET, the channel is an inversion layer formed by attraction of minority carriers toward
the gate. These carriers form a thin conducting layer that is prevented from reaching the gate by a thin
gate-oxide isulating layer when the gate bias exceeds threshold. In a buried-channel, or depletion-mode (or
normally on) MOSFET, the channel is present even at zero gate bias, and the gate serves to increase the
channel resistance when its bias is nonzero. Thus, this device is based on majority-carrier modulation,
like a MESFET.
