The defense special security communications system (DSSCS) was established for the purpose of 
integrating the critical intelligence communications (CRITICOMM) and the special intelligence 
communications (SPINTCOMM) networks into a single automated communications network. In effect, 
the integration of DSSCS subscribers into AUTODIN provides two separate systems within AUTODIN-
one system for special intelligence (SI) message traffic and the other for the AUTODIN regular message 
traffic.
