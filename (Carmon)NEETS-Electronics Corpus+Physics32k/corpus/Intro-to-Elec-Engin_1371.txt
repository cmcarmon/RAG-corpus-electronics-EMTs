If an ampliﬁer is designed having three identical
states, each of which has a gain of Gi = 5 and a
noise ﬁgure of Fi = 6, i = 1, 2, 3, determine
the overall noise ﬁgure of the cascade of the
three stages. Looking at the result, justify the
statement that the front end of a receiver should
have a low noise ﬁgure and a high gain. (Note
that the noise ﬁgure of an ampliﬁer is F =
1 + Ta/T0.)
