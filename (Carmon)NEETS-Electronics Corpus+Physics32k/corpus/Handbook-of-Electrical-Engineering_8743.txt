The  functional  form  will  seem  strange  to  a  procedural  programmer  because  it  is  higher  level,  e.g.,  more
abstract. It hides more details and uses functional operators HEAD (for returning the ﬁrst element of XList),
TAIL  (for  returning  the  N–1  tail  elements  of  XList),  and  is  for  binding  a  value  to  a  name.  Also,  notice  the
disappearance  of  the  loop.  Recursion  on  SUM  is  used  to  run  through  the  entire  list,  one  element  at  a  time.
Finally, the guard N>0 prevents further recursion when N reaches zero.
