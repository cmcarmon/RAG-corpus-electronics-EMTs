A Brief Historical Review
Probably the ﬁrst recorded storage device, developed by Schickard in 1623, used mechanical positions of cogs
and gears to work a semi-automatic calculator. Then came Pascal’s calculating machine based on 10 digits per
wheel. In 1812 punched cards were used in weaving looms to store patterns for woven material. Since that time
there have been many mechanical and, latterly, electromechanical devices developed for memory and storage.
In 1948 at Manchester University in England the cathode ray tube (Williams) and the magnetic drum were
developed. These consisted of 1024 bits and 1280 bits and a magnetic drum capacity of 120K bits. Cambridge
University  developed  the  mercury  delay  line  in  1949,  which  represented  the  ﬁrst  fully  operational  delay  line
memory, consisting of 576 bits per tube with a total capacity of 18K bits and a circulation time of 1.1 ms.
