The quasi-harmonic approximation is a phonon-based model of solid-state physics used to describe volume-dependent thermal effects, such as the thermal expansion. It is based on the assumption that the harmonic approximation holds for every value of the lattice constant, which is to be viewed as an adjustable parameter.
