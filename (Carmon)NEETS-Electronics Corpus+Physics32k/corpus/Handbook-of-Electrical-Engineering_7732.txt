Fixed-Head Disk
The concept of a Ô¨Åxed-head disk is to place a read/write head at every track position. The need for positioning
the  heads  is  eliminated,  thus  eliminating  the  seek  time  altogether.  The  approach  does  not  assist  in  reducing
rotational latencies, nor does it lessen the transfer time. Fixed-head disks were often used in the early days of
computing  systems  as  a  back-end  store  for  virtual  memory.  However,  since  modern  disks  have  hundreds  of
tracks per surface, placing a head at every position is no longer viewed as an economical solution.
