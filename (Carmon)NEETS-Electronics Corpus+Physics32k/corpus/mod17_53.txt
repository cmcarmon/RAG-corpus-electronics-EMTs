Teletypewriter (tty) signals may be transmitted by either landline (wire), cable, or radio. The landline 
tty is used both by the military services and by commercial communication companies. The Navy uses 
radio teletypewriter (rtty) mainly for high-speed automatic communications across ocean areas. The tty 
unit is equipped with a keyboard similar to a typewriter. When the operator presses a key, a sequence of 
signals is transmitted. At receiving stations, the signals are fed into terminal equipment that translates the 
sequences of signals into letters, figures, and symbols and types the messages automatically.
