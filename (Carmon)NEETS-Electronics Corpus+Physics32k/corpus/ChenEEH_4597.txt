control
technique incorporates a separate fault detection
scheme, a failure diagnosis mechanism, and postfailure control
actions to form a more sophisticated and complete FDA
methodology. An intelligent control regulator is parallel with
the postfailure control actions and the nominal controller
to emphasize that, in online situations, the effective control
actions that may come from one of the three sources [the
nominal controller (corresponding to fault-free situations),
the post-failure control actions (corresponding to expected
failure modes), and the intelligent control regulator (corres-
ponding to the unanticipated failure scenarios)] are decided
based on system behavior or health. The intelligent fault
accommodation technique will be applied only when it is
necessary for control purposes. Under this framework, the
unnecessary computational waste for anticipated failures and
false alarms could be avoided. A clearer picture of how this
idea works is depicted in a ﬂow chart shown in Figure 8.6.
The system ‘‘health’’ is continuously monitored by the fault-
detection scheme with the knowledge of the nominal system
behavior every certain period of time. Any abnormal behavior
