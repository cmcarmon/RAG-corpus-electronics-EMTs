To CHARGE the capacitor, the switch must be thrown to position 2, which places the capacitor across
the terminals of the battery. Under the assumed perfect conditions, the capacitor would reach full charge
instantaneously. However, the charging action is spread out over a period of time in the following
discussion so that a step-by-step analysis can be made.
