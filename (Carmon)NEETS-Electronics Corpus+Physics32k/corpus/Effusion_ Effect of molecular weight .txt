At constant pressure and temperature, the root-mean-square speed and therefore the effusion rate are inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight. Gases with a lower molecular weight effuse more rapidly than gases with a higher molecular weight, so that the number of lighter molecules passing through the hole per unit time is greater. This is why a balloon filled with low molecular weight helium (M = 4) deflates faster than an equivalent balloon full of higher molecular weight oxygen (M = 32). However the total mass of the escaping molecules is directly proportional to the square root of the molecular weight and is less for lighter molecules.
