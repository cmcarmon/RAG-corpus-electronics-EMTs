Termination in Z0 (characteristic impedance) will cause a constant reading on an ac meter when it is
moved along the length of the line. As illustrated in figure 3-34, view A, the curve, provided there are no
losses in the line, will be a straight line. If there are losses in the line, the amplitude of the voltage and
current will diminish as they move down the line (view B). The losses are due to dc resistance in the line
itself.
