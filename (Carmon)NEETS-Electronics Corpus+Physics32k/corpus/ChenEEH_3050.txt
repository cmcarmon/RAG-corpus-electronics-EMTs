The main difference between transmission and distribution
lines is the voltage level. They always have three wires for the
three phases insulated for the voltage level and can be with or
without a fourth grounded (uninsulated) wire. They can be
strung overhead on wooden or steel towers, or they can be laid
underground in conduits. Overhead lines are bare and are
hung from a string of insulators that can insulate the high
voltage from the tower. Underground cables have to be
covered in insulation throughout.
