In the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation
0 = (m•d′)x0 + (d×d′)•x ,
where x = (x1,x2,x3).
The slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.
