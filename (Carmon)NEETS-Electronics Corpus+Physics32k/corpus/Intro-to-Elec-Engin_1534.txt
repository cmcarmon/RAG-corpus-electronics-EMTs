A global positioning system (GPS) is a modern and sophisticated system in which signals are
broadcast from a network of 24 satellites. A receiver, which contains a special-purpose computer
to process the received signals and compare their phases, can establish its position quite accurately.
Such receivers are used by ï¬‚yers, boaters, and bikers. Various radio systems that utilize phase
relationships among signals received from several radio transmitters have been employed in
navigation, surveying, and accurate time determination. An early system of this type, known as
LORAN, was developed so that the receivers could determine their latitudes and longitudes.
