. FDDI MAC uses the Time-Token Protocol (TTP) for both
synchronous and asynchronous services to all stations. If
a token arrives earlier based on the rotation timer, a
station can optionally send the asynchronous data. If
the token is late, only the synchronous data can be sent.
In IEEE 802.5, MAC protocol is based on explicit priority
reservation. Both protocols allow the network to respond
to changes in trafﬁc load, but FDDI supports more steady
load because lower-priority trafﬁc may have more oppor-
tunity to send when a token arrives early.
