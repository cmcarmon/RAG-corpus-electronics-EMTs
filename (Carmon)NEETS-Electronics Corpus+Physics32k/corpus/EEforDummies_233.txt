By adding a 470 Ω resistor and an LED between the center terminal of the 
switch and the negative power rail, you create an indicator light for your on/
off switch. (See Figure 4-15.) If the switch is in the off position, the battery is 
not connected to the LED, so the LED is off. If the switch is in the on position, 
the battery is connected to the LED, so the LED is on.
