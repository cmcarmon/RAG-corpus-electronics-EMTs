One of the most serious troubles that can occur in a circuit is a DIRECT SHORT. Another term used
to describe this condition is a SHORT CIRCUIT. The two terms mean the same thing and, in this chapter,
the term direct short will be used. This term is used to describe a situation in which some point in the
circuit, where full system voltage is present, comes in direct contact with the ground or return side of the
circuit. This establishes a path for current flow that contains only the very small resistance present in the
wires carrying the current.
