The key element of a microcomputer is the LSI microprocessor chip, whose circuitry can
acquire, interpret, and execute a sequence of logical and arithmetic instructions. Although
most computer programming is done in a high level language, the processor itself deals only
with binary numbers that represent operation codes (move data, add, subtract, compare,
jump, etc.) and addresses (routing information for the data ï¬‚ow) of registers, memory
locations or input/output data ports.
