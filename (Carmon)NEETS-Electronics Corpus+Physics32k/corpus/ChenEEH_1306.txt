asynchronous receiver transmitters (UARTs), and parallel
input/outputs (PIOs). A video graphics adapter (VGA) inter-
face is used to send signals to a monitor; a parallel port is used
to communicate with a printer; and a serial port is used to
communicate with a mouse, and so on. First, an interface takes
signals from busses according to an I/O addresses. For
example, a UART chip can read a byte from the data bus and
output it in a serial format with parity check. It can be conﬁg-
ured as various transmission speeds from 1200 bps to 115,200
bps. Different interfaces have their own speciﬁcations and
transmission protocols. The following subsections give a brief
introduction.
