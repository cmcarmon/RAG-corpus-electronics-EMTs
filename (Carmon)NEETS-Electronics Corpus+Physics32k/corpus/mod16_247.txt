In some instruments, the reeds are the same length; but they are weighted by different amounts at the
top so they will have different natural rates of vibration. An end view of the reeds in the indicator is
shown in view C. If the energizing current has a frequency of 60 hertz, the reed marked 60 will vibrate the
greatest amount, as shown. View D shows a hand-held vibrating-reed frequency meter mounted on the
casing of a motor-generator.
