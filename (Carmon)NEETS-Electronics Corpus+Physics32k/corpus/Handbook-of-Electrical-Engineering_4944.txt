It was known over 2000 years ago that certain minerals such as tourmaline would attract small objects when
heated.  It  was  understood  over  200  years  ago  that  this  attraction  was  a  manifestation  of  the  appearance  of
pyroelectric
electrical charges on the surface as a consequence of the temperature change. This is called the 
effect and over the last 15 years has become the basis of a major worldwide industry manufacturing detectors
of infrared radiation. These are exploited in such devices as “people detectors” for intruder alarms and energy
conservation systems, ﬁre and ﬂame detectors, spectroscopic gas analyzers—especially looking for pollutants
from  car  exhausts—and,  more  recently,  devices  for  thermal  imaging.  Such  thermal  imagers  can  be  used  for
night  vision  and,  by  exploiting  the  smoke-penetrating  properties  of  long-wavelength  infrared  radiation,  in
devices to assist ﬁreﬁghters in smoke-ﬁlled spaces. The major advantages of the devices in comparison with
the competing infrared detectors that exploit narrow bandgap semiconductors are that no cooling is necessary
and that they are cheap and consume little power.
