b) Now find a simple equation to describe the operation of Op Amp 1, that is, find an
expression for V1 in terms of V2, Vin, and V3. (Note that in all of our impedance
calculations, we have been implicitly assuming that the relation among Vâ€™s for such
a circuit is the same as the relation among the time variables v(t).)
