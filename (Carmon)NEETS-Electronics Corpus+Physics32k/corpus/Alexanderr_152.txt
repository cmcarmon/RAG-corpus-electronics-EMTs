Solution:
The  Ô¨Årst  step  is  to  draw  the  given  circuit  using  Schematics.  If  one
follows  the  instructions  given  in Appendix  sections  D.2  and  D.3,  the
schematic in Fig. 3.32 is produced. Since this is a dc analysis, we use
voltage  source  VDC  and  current  source  IDC.  The  pseudocomponent
VIEWPOINTS are added to display the required node voltages. Once
the  circuit  is  drawn  and  saved  as  exam310.sch,  we  run  PSpice by
selecting  Analysis/Simulate.  The  circuit  is  simulated  and  the  results
