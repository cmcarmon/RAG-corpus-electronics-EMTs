For this topology, the maximum amplitude does not occur at the resonant frequency
ω0 (prove this, but don’t work out all the math). However, this is a small effect for all
but very low Q. Find expressions for the resonant frequency (defined as the frequency
where the s2 and the s0 terms cancel in the denominator) and the Q.

a) Draw the Bode plot of |Z(w)| for R = L = C = 1. What is the resonant
