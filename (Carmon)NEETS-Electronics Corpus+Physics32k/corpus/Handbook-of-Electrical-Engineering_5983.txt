where  Tem  is  the  electromagnetic  torque  developed  by  the  machine;  Tloss,  the  equivalent  torque  representing
friction and windage and stray load losses; and Tmech, the externally applied mechanical torque on the shaft in
the direction of rotation. As shown in Fig. 66.30, Tem is positive for  motoring and negative for generating; Tmech
is negative for motoring and positive for generating.
