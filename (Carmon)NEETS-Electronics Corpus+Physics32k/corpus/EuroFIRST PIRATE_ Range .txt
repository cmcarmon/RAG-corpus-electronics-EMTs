The range of the sensor is a closely guarded secret by the EuroFirst consortium but confirmed to be more than 74 km .The RAND Corporation reports ranges of 50 nm (93 km) to a subsonic target from the front and up to 90 nm from the rear of a subsonic target.  However, the weather conditions will affect the performance of the infrared-based target search and target tracking significantly.  In 2013, the detection range of PIRATE was said to be further increased by software updates.
