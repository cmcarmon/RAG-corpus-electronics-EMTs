A typical rf impedance bridge circuit is shown in figure 3-9. Rf impedance bridge measurements 
require an rf signal generator, a detector, and a calibrated rf bridge to determine transmission-line 
impedance. The bridge compares the parallel resistive-reactive combination with the series combination 
and can typically measure impedance over a frequency range of 500 kHz to 60 MHz.
