To meet future requirements, a number of critical issues
must be addressed. For example, advanced power devices and
control technologies are needed for high-efﬁciency and high-
frequency operations. Today’s vertical power device technology
cannot provide acceptable levels of conversion efﬁciency at a
multimegahertz level due to its high conduction and switching
and gate drive losses. This chapter addresses important issues
of advanced VRM topologies for fast transient responses and
low ripple voltages as well as advanced packaging technologies
for improving power density and thermal management. In
addition, this discussion covers the limitations of today’s tech-
