At higher voltages, partial discharges were found to occur in
voids in the insulation. This problem was solved by the use of a
low-viscosity oil-impregnated paper insulation system. Volt-
ages as high as 132 kV could be reached. Present day self-
contained oil-ﬁlled cables have not changed much from this
design that was ﬁrst introduced in 1917. Self-contained oil-
ﬁlled cables are in operation in Canada and the United States
at 230 kV, 315 kV, and 500 kV.
