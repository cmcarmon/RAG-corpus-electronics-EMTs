There is one other problem with our representations illustrated in
Figures 5.6 and 5.5: They do not offer any immunity to noise. To illustrate,
consider our representation in Figure 5.5 with a high and low voltage thresh-
old bounding a forbidden region. In that representation, recall that senders can
output voltages above VH and below 5 V for logical 1’s and voltages below VL
and above 0 V for logical 0’s. Receivers must correspondingly interpret output
voltages above VH as logical 1’s and voltages below VL as logical 0’s.
