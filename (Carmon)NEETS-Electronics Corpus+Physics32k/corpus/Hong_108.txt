This amplifier is sometimes called current-summing amplifier because all current 
sourced into the negative input will be drain via the feedback resistor. This property can 
be used to amplify current based signal sources such as photodiodes as shown in Figure 
###.  In  this  case  the  output  voltage  is  simply 
.  A  much  more  extensive 
discussion on photodiode amplifiers can be found in section 17.3.2
