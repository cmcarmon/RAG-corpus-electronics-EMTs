A periodic  waveform is one with the same 
waveform for all cycles. According to the frequency 
 domain concept, all periodic waveforms are made up 
of sine waves. In other words, superimposing a number 
of sine waves having different amplitudes, phases, and 
frequencies can form any periodic wave. Sine waves 
are important because they are the only waveform that 
cannot be distorted by RC, RL, or LC circuits.
