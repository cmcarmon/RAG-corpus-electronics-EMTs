Remember from Section 1.8.1, this is exactly one half of the power delivered
by the DC voltage of the same amplitude. Recall, also from Section 1.8.1, the
voltage unit called the root-mean-square voltage, abbreviated rms, which is
related to the peak amplitude of the sinewave by the square root of two
