In both cases, the physical quantity of interest, either the information or
the energy, is represented in the circuit by an electrical signal, namely a current
or a voltage, and circuit networks are used to process these signals. Thus, the
manner in which a circuit fulfills its purpose is effectively the manner in which
it treats the signals that are its terminal currents and voltages.
