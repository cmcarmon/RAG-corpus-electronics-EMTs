Dynamic Models
Two of the most popular methods used to obtain dynamic models of the robot are the Newton-Euler method
and the Lagrange-Euler method. The equations obtained using Lagrangian formulation are more suitable for
the  application  of  modern  control  theory  than  the  recursive  equations  obtained  using  the  Newton-Euler
method. In the Lagrangian formulation, the dynamic models are obtained using kinetic and potential energies
associated with the rigid bodies in motion. The derivation is systematic and conceptually simple. This method
yields closed-form dynamic equations that explicitly express joint variables in terms of joint torques. To arrive
