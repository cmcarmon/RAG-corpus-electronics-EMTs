Since Tc is chosen so that Tb @ Tc, then relative to the bandwidth of the BPSK information signal, the bandwidth
of  the  DS/BPSK  signal2  is  effectively  increased  by  the  ratio Tb/Tc  = Wss/2Rb,  which  is  one-half  the  spreading
factor  or  processing  gain  of  the  system. At  the  receiver,  the  sum  of  the  transmitted  DS/BPSK  signal  and  the
channel interference I(t) (as discussed before, we ignore the presence of the additive thermal noise) are ideally
multiplied by the identical DS modulation (this operation is known as despreading), which returns the DS/BPSK
signal to its original BPSK form whereas the real interference signal is now the real wideband signal Re{(t)c(t)}.
In the previous sentence, we used the word ideally, which implies that the PN waveform used for despreading
at  the  receiver  is  identical  to  that  used  for  spreading  at  the  transmitter.  This  simple  implication  covers  up  a
