Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  measure 
response of an inverting operational amplifier.  
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  AF  signal  generator  (with  variable 
frequency sine wave output), two AF voltmeters (or 
a dual beam oscilloscope), Â±9 V d.c. power supply 
(or 
two  9  V  batteries),  TL081  (or  similar 
operational  amplifier),  22  pF,  2.2  nF,  47  nF  and 
220  nF  capacitors,  resistors  of  10  kG and  
100 kG 5% 0.25 W, test leads, connecting  wire.
