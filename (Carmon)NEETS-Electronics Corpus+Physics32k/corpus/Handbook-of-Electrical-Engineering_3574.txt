Coding  test  techniques  encode  signal  information  so  that  errors  can  be  detected  and  possibly  corrected.
Although often implemented in software, coding techniques can also be implemented in hardware. For example,
a  simple  coding  technique  called  parity  checking  is  often  implemented  in  hardware.  Parity  checking  adds  an
extra bit to multibit data. The parity bit is set such that the total number of logic 1s in the multibit data and
parity bit is either an even number (even parity) or an odd number (odd parity). An error has occurred if an
even-parity-encoded signal contains an odd number of logic 1s or if an odd-parity-encoded signal contains an
even number of logic 1s. Coding techniques are used extensively to detect and correct transmission errors on
system buses and networks, storage errors in system memory, and computational errors in processors [Peterson
and Weldon, 1972].
