Short range order refers to the regular and predictable arrangement of atoms over a short distance, usually with one or two atom spacings. However, this regularity does not persist over a long distance.
Examples of materials with short range order include amorphous materials such as wax, glass and liquids as well as the collagen fibrils of the stroma in the cornea.
