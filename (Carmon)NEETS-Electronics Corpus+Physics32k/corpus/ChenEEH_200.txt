Nonlinearity plays a crucial role in many systems and qualita-
tively affects their behavior. For example, most circuits ema-
nating from the designs of integrated electronic circuits and
systems are nonlinear. It is not an overstatement to say that
the majority of interesting electronic circuits and systems are
nonlinear.
