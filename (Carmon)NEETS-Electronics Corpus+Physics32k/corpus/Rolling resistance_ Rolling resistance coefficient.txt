The "rolling resistance coefficient" is defined by the following equation:





F
=

C

r
r


N


{\displaystyle \ F=C_{rr}N}

where




F


{\displaystyle F}
is the rolling resistance force (shown in figure 1),





C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is the dimensionless rolling resistance coefficient or coefficient of rolling friction (CRF), and




N


{\displaystyle N}
is the normal force, the force perpendicular to the surface on which the wheel is rolling.





C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is the force needed to push (or tow) a wheeled vehicle forward (at constant speed on a level surface, or zero grade, with zero air resistance) per unit force of weight. It is assumed that all wheels are the same and bear identical weight. Thus:





C

r
r


=
0.01


{\displaystyle \ C_{rr}=0.01}
means that it would only take 0.01 pounds to tow a vehicle weighing one pound. For a 1000-pound vehicle, it would take 1000 times more tow force, i.e. 10 pounds. One could say that




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is in lb(tow-force)/lb(vehicle weight). Since this lb/lb is force divided by force,




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is dimensionless. Multiply it by 100 and you get the percent (%) of the weight of the vehicle required to maintain slow steady speed.




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is often multiplied by 1000 to get the parts per thousand, which is the same as kilograms (kg force) per metric ton (tonne = 1000 kg ), which is the same as pounds of resistance per 1000 pounds of load or Newtons/kilo-Newton, etc. For the US railroads, lb/ton has been traditionally used; this is just

r
r




{\displaystyle 2000C_{rr}}
. Thus, they are all just measures of resistance per unit vehicle weight. While they are all "specific resistances", sometimes they are just called "resistance" although they are really a coefficient (ratio)or a multiple thereof. If using pounds or kilograms as force units, mass is equal to weight (in earth's gravity a kilogram a mass weighs a kilogram and exerts a kilogram of force) so one could claim that




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
is also the force per unit mass in such units. The SI system would use N/tonne (N/T, N/t), which is



1000
g

C

r
r




{\displaystyle 1000gC_{rr}}
and is force per unit mass, where g is the acceleration of gravity in SI units (meters per second square).
The above shows resistance proportional to




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
but does not explicitly show any variation with speed, loads, torque, surface roughness, diameter, tire inflation/wear, etc. because




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
itself varies with those factors. It might seem from the above definition of




C

r
r




{\displaystyle C_{rr}}
that the rolling resistance is directly proportional to vehicle weight but it is not.
