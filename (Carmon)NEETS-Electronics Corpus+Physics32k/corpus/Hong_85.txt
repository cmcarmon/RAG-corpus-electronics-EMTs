The amount of diffusion current is approximately proportional to the amount of 
base-emitter current. The proportionality constant, typically denoted as β, is the current 
gain of the transistor. The value of β depends on geometry of the device and the doping 
concentrations of the collector, base, and emitter. For most commercial transistors, β is 
between 100 and 1000. A much more detailed explanation of the physics and design of 
transistors can be found in texts such as [Ref].
