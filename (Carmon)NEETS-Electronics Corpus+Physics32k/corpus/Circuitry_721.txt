indications  for  silicon  PNP 
transistors are shown in Fig.  15.9 (forward bias is 
applied in Fig. 15.9(a) and reverse bias is applied in 
Fig. 
transistors, 
corresponding indications for germanium PNP will 
be  somewhat 
the  ×100 
resistance  range  should  be  used  for  measurements 
below 20 kH, and the ×1k resistance range should 
be used for measurements above 20 kH.
