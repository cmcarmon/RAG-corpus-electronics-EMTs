Problems 
 
6.1   A  half-wave  rectifier  is  fitted  with  an  R–C
smoothing filter comprising R = 200 G and
 
 
C = 50 µF. If 2 V of 400 Hz ripple appear at
the input of the circuit, determine the  mount 
 
 
of ripple appearing at the output. 
6.2   The  L–C  smoothing  filter  fitted  to  a  50  Hz
mains  operated  full-wave  rectifier  circuit
 
consists of L = 4 H and C = 500 µF. If 4 V
 
of  ripple  appear  at  the  input  of  the  circuit,
 
determine the amount of ripple appearing at
 
the output. 
 
6.3  
If a 9 V zener diode is to be used in a simple
shunt  regulator  circuit  to  supply  a  load 
 
having  a  nominal  resistance  of  300  G,
 
determine  the  maximum  value  of  series 
resistor  for  operation  in  conjunction  with  a 
supply of 15 V.
