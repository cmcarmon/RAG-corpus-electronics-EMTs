Linear Position Sensors
Large-area photodiodes can be made into single axis and two axis position sensors. The single axis device is a
long strip detector, and the two axis is normally square. In the single axis device the common terminal is in
the middle and there are two signal terminals, one at each end. When a light beam is directed onto the detector,
the relative output current from each signal terminal depends on how close the beam is to the terminal. The
sum of the output currents from both terminals is proportional to the light intensity.
