(note that this is similar to the expression for hfe). 
  Now, suppose that we apply a steady bias current 
of,  say,  240  µA  and  superimpose  on  this  a  signal 
that  varies  above  and  below  this  value,  swinging 
through a total change of 220 µA (i.e. from 120 µA 
to 360 µA). Figure 7.28 shows that this produces a 
collector current swing of 10 mA.  
  The small-signal a.c. current gain is given by:
