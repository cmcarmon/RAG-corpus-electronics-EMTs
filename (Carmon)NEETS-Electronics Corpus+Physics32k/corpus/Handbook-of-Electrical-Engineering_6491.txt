The need for such systems in cable television distribution systems has motivated the development of suitable
high-performance lasers. Before the availability of lightwave AM-VSB systems, cable systems used long (up to
20 km) trunks of coaxial cable with dozens of cascaded electronic ampliÔ¨Åers to overcome cable loss. Accumu-
lations of distortion and noise, as well as inherent reliability problems with long cascades, were serious limi-
tations.
