The color signal consists of two chrominance components, I and Q, transmitted as amplitude-modulated
sidebands  of  two  3.579545-MHz  subcarriers  in  quadrature.  The  subcarriers  are  suppressed,  leaving  only  the
sidebands  in  the  color  signal.  Suppression  of  the  carriers  permits  demodulation  of  the  color  signal  as  two
separate color signals in a receiver by reinsertion of a carrier of the phase corresponding to the desired color
signal (synchronous demodulation).
