View B shows the next half cycle of secondary voltage. Now the polarities across W1 and W2 are 
reversed. During this alternation, the anode of D1 is driven negative and D1 cannot conduct. For the 
period of time that the anode of D1 is negative, the anode of D2 is positive, permitting D2 to conduct. 
Notice that the anode current of D2 passes through the load resistor in the same direction as the current of 
D1 did. In this circuit arrangement, a pulse of load current flows during each alternation of the input 
cycle. Since both alternations of the input voltage cycle are used, the circuit is called a FULL-WAVE 
RECTIFIER.
