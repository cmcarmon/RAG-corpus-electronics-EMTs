An  N750  temperature-compensated  capacitor  is  used  when  accurate  capacitance  is  required  over  a  large
temperature range. The 750 indicates a 750-ppm decrease in capacitance with a 1(cid:176)C increase in temperature
(750 ppm/(cid:176)C). This equates to a 1.5% decrease in capacitance for a 20(cid:176)C temperature increase. N750 capacitors
come in values between 4.0 and 680 pF.
