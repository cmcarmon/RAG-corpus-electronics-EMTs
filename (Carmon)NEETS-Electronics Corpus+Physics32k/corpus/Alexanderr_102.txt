for the single-range volt-
for  the  multiple-range
meter  in  Fig.  2.60(a),  or 
to be
voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b). We need to determine the value of 
connected in series with the internal resistance 
of the voltmeter. In
any  design,  we  consider  the  worst-case  condition.  In  this  case,  the
worst  case  occurs  when  the  full-scale  current 
ï¬‚ows  through
the meter. This should also correspond to the maximum voltage read-
ing or the full-scale voltage 
is in
series with the internal resistance
