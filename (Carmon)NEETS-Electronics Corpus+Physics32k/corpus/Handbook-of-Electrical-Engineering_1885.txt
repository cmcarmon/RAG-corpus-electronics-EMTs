The major difference between VLIW architectures and the superscalar architectures found in modern micro-
processors is that VLIW machines have statically scheduled operations. A superscalar machine has hardware that
examines the instruction stream to determine what operations can be performed in parallel; for example, when
two independent operations appear in consecutive instructions, those instructions can be executed in parallel.
A VLIW machine relies on a compiler to identify parallelism in the program and to pack those operations into
instruction words. This requires sophisticated compilers that can extract parallelism and effectively make use of
it when generating instructions. Video is especially well-suited to VLIW because video programs have a great
deal of parallelism that is relatively easy to identify and take advantage of in a VLIW machine.
