An ohmmeter is the device used to check for shorts. You can use the ohmmeter to detect a short
between two conductors by measuring the resistance between them (be sure electrical power has been
disconnected). A low resistance reading indicates a short. You can test the circuit in figure 3-20 for a
short by first removing the jumper and disconnecting both plugs; you then measure the resistance between
the two suspended conductors.
