shunt resistor and measure the calibration signal voltage developed across it with an accurate voltmeter.
The calibration signal current can then be calculated by means of Ohmâ€™s law. Since the oscilloscope
merely indicates the voltage developed across the shunt resistor, the measurements for alternating or
direct current will be similar to voltage measurements using an oscilloscope.
