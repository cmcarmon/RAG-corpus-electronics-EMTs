During the optimization process, power minimization is never
the only optimization objective. Performance is always impli-
citly of ultimate importance in the design of any digital system.
Unfortunately, meeting both requirements is very hard if not
impossible. Major techniques that target one objective have
side effects with respect to the other. For this reason, several
metrics for joint power performance have been proposed in
the past. In many designs, the power-delay product (PDP, or
the energy) is an acceptable metric. Energy minimization rules
outdesign choices that heavily compromise performance to
reduce power consumption. When performance has priority
over power consumption, the energy-delay product (EDP) can
be adopted to tightly control performance degradation (Burd
and Brodersen, 1996).
