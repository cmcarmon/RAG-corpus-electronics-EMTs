Making all kinds of components possible
Transistors can be combined in all sorts of ways to make lots of incredible 
things happen. Because the semiconductor material that makes up a transis-
tor is so small, itâ€™s possible to create a circuit containing hundreds or thou-
sands of transistors (along with resistors and other components) and plop 
the entire circuit into a single component that fits easily into the palm of your
