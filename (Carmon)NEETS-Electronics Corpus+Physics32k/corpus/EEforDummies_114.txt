Many electronic components can help control the electrical 
energy in  circuits. Among the most popular components 
are resistors, which restrict current flow, and capacitors, 
which store electrical energy. Inductors and transform-
ers are devices that store electrical energy in mag-
netic fields. Diodes are used to restrict current flow in 
one direction, much like valves, while  transistors are 
versatile components that can be used to switch cir-
cuits on and off, or amplify current. Integrated circuits 
(ICs) contain multiple discrete (that is, individual) 
components in a single package and are able to con-
trol current in many ways, depending on the particu-
lar IC. Sensors, switches, and other parts also play 
important roles in circuits.
