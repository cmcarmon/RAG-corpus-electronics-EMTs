The IEEE 802.5 token ring standard speciﬁes a token-timing service discipline that requires transmissions to
be completed within a ﬁxed time after the token is seized, but implementations sometimes use the simpler one-
shot  service  discipline.  The  ANSI  X3T9.5  ﬁber  distributed  data  interface  (FDDI)  standard  uses  an  adaptive
token-timing service discipline that is intended to guarantee a minimum amount of (synchronous) bandwidth
to each station.
