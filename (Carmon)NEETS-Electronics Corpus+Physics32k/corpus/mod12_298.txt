Notice the simplicity of operation of the circuit in figure 2-16. An af signal that is applied to the
input results in the following actions: (1) On the positive alternation, reverse bias increases and the
dielectric (depletion region) width increases. This decreases capacitance which increases the frequency of
the oscillator. (2) On the negative alternation, the reverse bias decreases, which results in a decrease in
oscillator frequency.
