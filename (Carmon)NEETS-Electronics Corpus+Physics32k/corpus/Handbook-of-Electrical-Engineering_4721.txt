Rather than substituting Eq. (48.7) and Eq. (48.2) into Eq. (48.6) to obtain a set of four equations similar
to Eq. (48.3), it is frequently more convenient to substitute Eq. (48.7) into the fourth equation in the set of Eq.
(48.6). Because there are no time derivatives involved, this substitution gives the potential as a linear combi-
nation of the components of the mechanical displacement:
