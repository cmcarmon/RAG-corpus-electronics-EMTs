The basic idea of a ”parallel” connection, on the other hand, is that all components are
connected across each other’s leads. In a purely parallel circuit, there are never more than two
sets of electrically common points, no matter how many components are connected. There are
many paths for electrons to ﬂow, but only one voltage across all components:
