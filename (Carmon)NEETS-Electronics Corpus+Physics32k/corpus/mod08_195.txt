In addition to the other circuit components, an amplifying device (transistor or electronic tube),
itself, reacts differently to high frequencies than it does to low frequencies. In earlier NEETS modules you
were told that transistors and electronic tubes have interelectrode capacitance. Figure 2-5 shows a portion
of the interelectrode capacitance of a transistor and the way in which this affects high- and low-frequency
signals.
