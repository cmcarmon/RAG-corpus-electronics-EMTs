Keep in mind that these voltage drops have a physical meaning. The electri-
cal energy supplied by the battery is absorbed by the resistor and the LED. 
The battery will keep supplying electrical energy, and the resistor and LED 
will keep absorbing that energy, until the battery dies (runs out of energy). 
That happens when all the chemicals inside the battery have been consumed 
in the chemical reactions that produced the positive and negative charges. 
In effect, all the chemical energy supplied by the battery has been converted 
into electrical energy â€” and absorbed by the circuit.
