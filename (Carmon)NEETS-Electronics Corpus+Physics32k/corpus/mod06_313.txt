In view C, the negative potential of the grid has been raised to -20 volts, which drives the tube into
cutoff. All of the electrostatic lines of force terminate at the negatively charged grid, instead of continuing
on to the cathode. The electrons emitted by the cathode will not feel the electrostatic attractive force of
the positively charged plate. Under these conditions, current cannot flow through the tube.
