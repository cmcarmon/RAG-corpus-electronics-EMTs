{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}}}{\frac {e^{2}}{\hbar c}}={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}{\frac {e^{2}c}{\hbar }}={\frac {k_{\text{e}}e^{2}}{\hbar c}}={\frac {c\mu _{0}}{2R_{\text{K}}}}={\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi }}{\frac {Z_{0}}{\hbar }}}

where:
e is the elementary charge;
π is the mathematical constant pi;
ħ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant;
c is the speed of light in vacuum;
ε0 is the electric constant or permittivity of free space;
µ0 is the magnetic constant or permeability of free space;
ke is the Coulomb constant;
RK is the von Klitzing constant;
Z0 is the vacuum impedance or impedance of free space.
The definition reflects the relationship between α and the elementary charge e, which equals √4παε0ħc.
