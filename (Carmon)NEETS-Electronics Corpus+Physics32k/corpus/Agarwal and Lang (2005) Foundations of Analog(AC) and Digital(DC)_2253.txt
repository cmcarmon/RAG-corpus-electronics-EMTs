and for the OFF state, vr = 0.
The regions of validity for these waveforms can be found from the constraint equations
for the ideal diode, Equations 16.2 and 16.3. The ON subcircuit only applies for iD
positive, hence the valid regions of vra are the positive segments. The OFF subcircuit
must therefore fill in the gaps. More formally, the OFF circuit applies when the voltage
across the ideal diode is negative, hence for vi less than 0.6 V. The composite solution is
shown in Figure 16.10d.
