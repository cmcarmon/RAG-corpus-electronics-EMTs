DIODE RECTIFIERS take advantage of the fact that diodes will conduct in only one direction.
When ac voltages are applied to diodes, conduction occurs only on the alternation that makes the plate
positive relative to the cathode. Because of this, the output current consists of one polarity. Because it
flows in pulses rather than continuously, it is called pulsating dc.
