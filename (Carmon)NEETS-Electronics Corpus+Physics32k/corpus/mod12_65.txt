In the modulation process, waves from the information source are impressed onto a radio-frequency 
sine wave called a CARRIER. This carrier is sufficiently high in frequency to have a wavelength short 
enough to be radiated from an antenna of practical dimensions. For example, a carrier frequency of 10 
megahertz has a wavelength of 30 meters, as shown below:
