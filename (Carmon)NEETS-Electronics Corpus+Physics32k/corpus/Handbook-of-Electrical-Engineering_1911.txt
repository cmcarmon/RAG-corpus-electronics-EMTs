In light of the situation, a change of direction was called to refocus on new or improved functionalities and
applications  that  are  not  addressed  by  existing  and  emerging  standards.  Examples  include  object-oriented
features  for  content-based  multimedia  database,  error-robust  communications  in  wireless  networks,  hybrid
nature  and  synthetic  image  authoring  and  rendering.  With  the  technological  convergence  of  digital  video,
computer  graphics,  and  Internet,  MPEG-4  aims  at  providing  an  audiovisual  coding  standard  allowing  for
interactivity, high compression, and/or universal accessibility, with a high degree of ﬂexibility and extensibility.
In  particular,  MPEG-4  intends  to  establish  a  ﬂexible  content-based  audio-visual  environment  that  can  be
customized for speciﬁc applications and that can be adapted in the future to take advantage of new technological
advances. It is foreseen that this environment will be capable of addressing new application areas ranging from
conventional storage and transmission of audio and video to truly interactive AV services requiring content-
based AV database access, e.g., video games or AV content creation. Efﬁcient coding, manipulation, and delivery
of AV information over Internet will be key features of the standard.
