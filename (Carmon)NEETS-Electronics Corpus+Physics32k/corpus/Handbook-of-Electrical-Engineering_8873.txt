consistency
The cache exploits spatial locality by loading an entire cache line after a miss. This tends to result in bursty
trafﬁc to the main memory, since most accesses are ﬁltered out by the cache. After a miss, however, the memory
system must provide an entire line at once. Cache memory nicely complements an interleaved, high-bandwidth
main  memory  (described  in  the  next  section),  since  a  cache  line  can  be  interleaved  across  many  banks  in  a
regular manner, thus avoiding memory conﬂicts, and thus can be loaded rapidly into the cache. The example
main memory shown in Fig. 88.3 can provide an entire cache line with two parallel memory accesses.
