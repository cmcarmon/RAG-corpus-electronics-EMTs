In a graph G, a path P connecting vertices vi and vj is an
alternating sequence of vertices and edges starting at vi and
ending at vj, with all vertices except vi and vj being distinct. In
a directed graph, a path P connecting vertices vi and vj
is
called a directed path from vi to vj if all the edges in P are
oriented in the same direction when traversing P from vi
toward vj.
