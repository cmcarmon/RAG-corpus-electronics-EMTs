Test personnel can connect the test fiber directly to the OTDR or to a dead-zone fiber. This dead-
zone fiber is placed between the test fiber and OTDR to reduce the effect of the initial reflection at the
OTDR on the fiber measurement. The dead-zone fiber is inserted because minimizing the reflection at a
fiber joint is easier than reducing the reflection at the OTDR connection.
