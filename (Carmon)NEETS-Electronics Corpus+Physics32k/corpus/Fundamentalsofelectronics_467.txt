(a) Find this ﬁlter’s transfer function.
(b) Find the magnitude and phase of this transfer function. How would you characterize this circuit?
(c) Let vin (t) be a square-wave of period T . What is the Fourier series for the output voltage?
(d) Use Matlab to ﬁnd the output’s waveform for the cases T = 0.01 and T = 2. What value of T delineates
