Here's a rule that applies to all spinning gyros: THE GYRO WILL ALWAYS PRECESS AT RIGHT 
ANGLES TO THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLIED FORCE. Look at view A again. If we keep pushing 
down on the gimbal ring at point (A), the gyro case will keep turning until the spin axis of the gyro wheel 
is horizontal. Then there will be no further precession. At this point the gyro wheel will be spinning in the 
same direction in which the applied force is pushing.
