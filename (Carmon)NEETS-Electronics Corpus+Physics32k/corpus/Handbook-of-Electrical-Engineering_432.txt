From the above discussions and Example 3.7 we see that the Mason approach is the best from the systems
viewpoint, especially when a single source is involved. It gives an excellent physical insight to the system and
reveals the cause-effect relationships at various stages when graph reduction technique is employed. While the
Coates approach enables one to compute the output directly regardless of the number of inputs involved in
the system, thus overcoming one of the difﬁculties associated with Mason’s approach, it does not allow one to
reduce the graph step-by-step toward the ﬁnal solution as Mason’s does. However, it is interesting to note that
in  the  modiﬁed  Coates  technique  the  introduction  of  the  loop-sets  (analogous  to  trees)  and  the  2-loop-sets
(analogous  to  2-trees)  brings  together  the  two  different  concepts—the  ﬂowgraph  approach  and  the  k-tree
approach.
