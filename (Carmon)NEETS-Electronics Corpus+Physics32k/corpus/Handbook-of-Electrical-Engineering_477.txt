T¢ parameters:
Transmission (inverse transmission) parameters: That set of two-port parameters, such as the T(T¢) param-
eters, where the dependent variables are the input (output) variables of the network and the independent
variables are the output (input) variables. The parenthetical expressions refer to the inverse transmission
parameters. See Table 3.2 for speciﬁc deﬁnitions.
