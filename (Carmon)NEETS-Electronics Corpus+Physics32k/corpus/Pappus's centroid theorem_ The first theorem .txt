The first theorem states that the surface area A of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a plane curve C about an axis external to C and on the same plane is equal to the product of the arc length s of C and the distance d traveled by its geometric centroid.

{\displaystyle A=sd.}

For example, the surface area of the torus with minor radius r and major radius R is
