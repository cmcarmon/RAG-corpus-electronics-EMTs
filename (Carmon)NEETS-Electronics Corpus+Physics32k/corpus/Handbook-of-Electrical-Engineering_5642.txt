The  actual  construction  of  a  major  transmission  facility  requires  three  to  ﬁve  years  or  more,  depending
largely on the siting and certiﬁcation process. As such, the planning process requires up to ten years prior to
operation of these facilities to ensure that they are available when required. The long lead times, environmental
impacts, and high costs required for new transmission facilities require careful, near-optimal planning. Future
changes in system operating conditions, such as changes in spatial load and generation patterns, create uncer-
tainties that challenge the transmission planning engineer to select the best technical solution among several
alternatives  with  due  consideration  of  nontechnical  factors.  Transmission  planning  strives  to  maintain  an
optimal balance between system reliability, environmental impacts, and cost under future uncertainties.
