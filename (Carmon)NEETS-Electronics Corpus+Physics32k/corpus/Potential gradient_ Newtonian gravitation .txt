In the case of the gravitational field g, which can be shown to be conservative, it is equal to the gradient in gravitational potential Φ:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =-\nabla \Phi .\,\!}

There are opposite signs between gravitational field and potential, because the potential gradient and field are opposite in direction: as the potential increases, the gravitational field strength decreases and vice versa.
