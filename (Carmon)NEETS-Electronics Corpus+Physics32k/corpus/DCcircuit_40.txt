Michael Faraday proved (1832) that static electricity was the same as that produced by a
battery or a generator. Static electricity is, for the most part, a nuisance. Black powder and
smokeless powder have graphite added to prevent ignition due to static electricity. It causes
damage to sensitive semiconductor circuitry. While it is possible to produce motors powered
by high voltage and low current characteristic of static electricity, this is not economic. The
few practical applications of static electricity include xerographic printing, the electrostatic air
Ô¨Ålter, and the high voltage Van de Graaff generator.
