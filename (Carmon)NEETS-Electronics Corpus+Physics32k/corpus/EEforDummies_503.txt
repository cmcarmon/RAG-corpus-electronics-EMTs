Inductors can be either fixed or variable. With either type, a length of wire is 
wound around a core. The number of turns of the wire, the core material, the 
wireâ€™s diameter, and length of the coil all determine the numerical value of 
the inductor. Fixed inductors have a constant value; variable inductors have 
adjustable values. The core of an inductor can be made of air, iron ferrite, or
