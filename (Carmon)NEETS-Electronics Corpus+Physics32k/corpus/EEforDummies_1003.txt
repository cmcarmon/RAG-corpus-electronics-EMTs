The circuit symbol for an op amp represents the interconnection of dozens 
of individual components in a nearly complete circuit (power is external to 
the op amp). Schematics always use a single symbol to represent the entire 
circuit, which is packaged as an integrated circuit (IC). The circuit symbol for 
an op amp is commonly used to represent many other amplifiers, such as an 
LM386 audio power amplifier.
