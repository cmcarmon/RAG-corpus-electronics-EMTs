A special kind of block diagram has been adopted as a standard symbol for the flip-flop and is shown 
in figures 3-25 and 3-26. The two inputs are represented by the lines on the left and the outputs by the 
lines on the right. INPUTS to a flip-flop are S (SET) and C (CLEAR) and OUTPUTS from a flip-flop are 
"1" and "0." A trigger pulse applied to the SET input causes the "1" output to be a positive or negative 
voltage, depending on the type of transistor. At the same time, the "0" output equals 0 volts. This 
condition is called the SET STATE.
