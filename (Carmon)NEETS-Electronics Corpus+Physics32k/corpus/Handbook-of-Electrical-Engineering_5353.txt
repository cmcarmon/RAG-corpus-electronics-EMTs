Treatments of the multi- and polycrystalline Si with hydrogen, lithium, aluminum, arsenic, and phosphorus
have been used with varying degrees of success to minimize the effects of active defects and boundary surfaces.
There is considerable effort on identifying treatment processes that beneﬁt commercially produced polycrys-
talline  Si  products  and  to  implement  them  into  manufacturing.  The  best  bulk  multicrystalline  Si  cells  have
reported 18.6% efﬁciency.
