After the loop has turned far enough so that its north pole is exactly opposite the south field pole, the 
brushes advance to the next segments. This changes the direction of current flow through the armature 
loop. Also, it changes the polarity of the armature field, as shown in figure 2-2 (view C). The magnetic 
fields again repel and attract each other, and the armature continues to turn.
