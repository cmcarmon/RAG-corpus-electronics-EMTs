The digital_algorithmic architecture makes use of the re-
source sharing and scheduling features of the synthesis prod-
ucts from Synopsys, which results in a relatively small circuit
design. The synthesized code consists of one multiplication
unit, one division unit, and some glue logic. The code given
in the following (algorithmic level) code and is fully synthesiz-
able by the Behavioral Compiler.
