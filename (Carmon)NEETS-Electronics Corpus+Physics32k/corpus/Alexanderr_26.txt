Current  direction  and  voltage  polarity  play  a  major  role  in  deter-
mining  the  sign  of  power.  It  is  therefore  important  that  we  pay  atten-
tion to the relationship between current i and voltage v in Fig. 1.8(a).
The  voltage  polarity  and  current  direction  must  conform  with  those
shown  in  Fig.  1.8(a)  in  order  for  the  power  to  have  a  positive  sign.
This is known as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign con-
vention,  current  enters  through  the  positive  polarity  of  the  voltage.  In

is releasing or supplying power.
