• Silicon feedstock (materials availability, solar-grade Si, competitiveness with electronic technologies)
• Manufacturing costs (yields, complexity)
• Manufacturing capacity (current output, demands, plans for increased capacity)
• Research (materials production, processing, solar cell design, thin ﬁlms)
