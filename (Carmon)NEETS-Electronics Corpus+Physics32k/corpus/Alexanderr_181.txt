Source transformation also applies to dependent sources, provided
we  carefully  handle  the  dependent  variable. As  shown  in  Fig.  4.16,  a
dependent  voltage  source  in  series  with  a  resistor  can  be  transformed
to a dependent current source in parallel with the resistor or vice versa
where we make sure that Eq. (4.5) is satisﬁed.
