If you put a gyroscope in place of the stake, you will see a different action. Imagine a gyroscope 
mounted at the Equator with its spin axis aligned with the E/W axis of the Earth. The gyro is spinning and 
has rigidity in space. Now look at view B. At 1200 the spinning axis is horizontal with respect to the 
Earth's surface. At 1800 the spinning axis is vertical with respect to the Earth's surface; but the gyro is 
still spinning in the same plane as before, and the black end is pointing away from the Earth's surface. At 
2400, the spinning axis is again horizontal. At 0600 the spinning axis is again vertical, and the black end 
points toward the Earth. Finally, at 1200 the next day, the gyro is in the same position as when it started. 
The plane of spin of the gyro wheel did not change direction in space while the gyro rotated with the 
Earth. This is because the gyro is rigid in space.
