If the applied Ô¨Åelds become strong enough, the domains
rotate and the material leaves the initial linear region of oper-
ation and enters the nonlinear and multivalued region indi-
cated by the hysteresis curve in Figure 1.6. The ratio B/H at
any point on the curves is the permeability m. Around point O,
the slope is nearly constant, whereas on the hysteresis curve it
is not; this indicates that the ferromagnetic material has
become nonlinear.
