MAC scheme was proposed by Harlow and Welch in 1965. In this method, a massless particle is introduced at the initial time at the free surface. The motion of this massless particle is followed with the passage of time.
Benefit: This scheme can treat complex phenomena like wave breaking.
Drawback: In three dimensional flow solving the equations governing fluid flow and also following the motion of a large number of markers both simultaneously demands high computational power.
