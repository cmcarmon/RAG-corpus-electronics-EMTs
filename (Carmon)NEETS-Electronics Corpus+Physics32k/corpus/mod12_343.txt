In pulse modulation you will need to know the percentage of time the system is actually producing
rf. For example, letâ€™s say that a pulse system is transmitting 25 percent of the time. This would mean that
the pw is 1/4 the prt. For every 60 minutes we operate the pulse system, we actually transmit a total of
only 15 minutes.
