The value of an investment is doubled if the return



r


{\displaystyle r}
= +100%, that is, if




r


l
o
g





{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {log} }}
= ln($200 / $100) = ln(2) = 69.3%. The value falls to zero when



r


{\displaystyle r}
= -100%. The ordinary return can be calculated for any non-zero initial investment value, and any final value, positive or negative, but the logarithmic return can only be calculated when

{\displaystyle V_{f}/V_{i}>0}
.
Ordinary returns and logarithmic returns are only equal when they are zero, but they are approximately equal when they are small. The difference between them is large only when percent changes are high. For example, an arithmetic return of +50% is equivalent to a logarithmic return of 40.55%, while an arithmetic return of -50% is equivalent to a logarithmic return of -69.31%.
