The circuit in the previous section is not a very practical one. In fact, it can be quite dangerous
to build (directly connecting the poles of a voltage source together with a single piece of wire).
The reason it is dangerous is because the magnitude of electric current may be very large
in such a short circuit, and the release of energy very dramatic (usually in the form of heat).
Usually, electric circuits are constructed in such a way as to make practical use of that released
energy, in as safe a manner as possible.
