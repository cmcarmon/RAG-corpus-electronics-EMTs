Photovoltaic Power Systems
The photovoltaic module is the power generating component of a power system. Systems can be generically
divided into stand-alone and grid-connected. A stand-alone system provides power directly to a load and usually
includes  storage.  Stand-alone  systems  can  vary  greatly  in  complexity. A  relatively  simple  system  is  a  lighting
system  that  includes  a  battery,  battery  charge  regulator,  the  photovoltaic  module(s),  and  the  lights.  More
complex stand-alone systems include a range of battery charging systems, provide power for a whole house,
provide  power  to  a  telecommunications  repeater,  or  provide  power  to  a  satellite.  All  of  these  systems  have
battery and the battery charge control electronics in common. The simplest stand-alone system is a water pump
that can be directly connected to the photovoltaic module. In this case, no electricity storage is required because
the pumped water can be stored if it is not immediately used.
