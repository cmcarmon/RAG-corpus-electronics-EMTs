One form of energy is that which is contained by an object in motion. When a hammer is set in
motion in the direction of a nail, it possesses energy of motion. As the hammer strikes the nail, the energy
of motion is converted into work as the nail is driven into the wood. The distance the nail is driven into
the wood depends on the velocity of the hammer at the time it strikes the nail. Energy contained by an
object due to its motion is called KINETIC ENERGY. Assume that the hammer is suspended by a string
in a position one meter above a nail. As a result of gravitational attraction, the hammer will experience a
force pulling it downward. If the string is suddenly cut, the force of gravity will pull the hammer
downward against the nail, driving it into the wood. While the hammer is suspended above the nail it has
ability to do work because of its elevated position in the earthâ€™s gravitational field. Since energy is the
ability to do work, the hammer contains energy.
