A ring sabot uses the rear fins on a long rod projectile to help center the projectile and ride the bore, and the multi-petal sabot forms only a single bulkhead ring around the projectile near the front, with an obturator sealing gases from escaping past it, and centering the front of the projectile. The former Soviet Union favored armor-piercing sabot projectiles using ring sabots, which performed acceptably for that era, manufactured from high strength steel for both the long rod penetrator and ring sabot. The strength of the steel ring was sufficient to withstand launch accelerations without the need for sabot ramps to also support the steel flight projectile.
