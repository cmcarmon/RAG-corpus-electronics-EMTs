where  Xc
is  the 
frequency  (in  Hertz),  and  C is  the  capacitance  (in 
Farads).  
  Capacitive reactance falls as frequency increases, 
as shown in Fig. 4.5. The applied voltage, Vc, and 
current,  Ic, flowing  in  a  pure  capacitive  reactance 
will  differ  in  phase  by  an  angle  of  90Â°  or  0/2
radians  (the  current  leads  the  voltage).  This 
relationship is illustrated in the current and voltage 
waveforms (drawn to a common time scale) shown 
in Fig. 4.6 and as a phasor diagram shown in Fig. 
4.7.
