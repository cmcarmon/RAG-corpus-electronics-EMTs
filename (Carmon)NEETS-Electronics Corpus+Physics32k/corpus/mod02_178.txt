A capacitor is capable of storing or holding a charge of electrons. When uncharged, both plates of the
capacitor contain essentially the same number of free electrons. When charged, one plate contains more free
electrons than the other plate. The difference in the number of electrons is a measure of the charge on the
capacitor. The accumulation of this charge builds up a voltage across the terminals of the capacitor, and the
charge continues to increase until this voltage equals the applied voltage. The charge in a capacitor is related
to the capacitance and voltage as follows:
