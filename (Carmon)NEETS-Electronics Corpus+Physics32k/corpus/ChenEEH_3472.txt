Induction motors are a very common type of load. The main
behavioral patterns of the induction motor are representative
of the patterns of many loads; their operation depends on the
conditions of the network that is supplying the power as well
as the loading conditions. This section gives a brief discussion
on the most important relaying requirements as well as the
most common relaying principles that apply to the induction
motor protection. Further details can be found in (Horowitz
and Phadke, 1992; Blackburn, 1998; Ungrad et al., 1995).
