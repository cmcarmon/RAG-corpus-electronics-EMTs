A shunt is a physically large, low-resistance conductor connected in parallel (shunt) with the meter
terminals. It is used to carry the majority of the load current. Such a shunt is designed with the correct
amount of resistance so that only a small portion of the total current flows through the meter coil. The
meter current is proportional to the total load current. If the shunt is of such a value that the meter is
calibrated in milliamperes, the instrument is called a MILLIAMMETER. If the shunt has such a value that
the meter must be calibrated in terms of amperes, it is called an AMMETER.
