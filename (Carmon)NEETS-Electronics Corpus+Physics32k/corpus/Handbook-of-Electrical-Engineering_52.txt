Ion-implanted  resistors  are  formed  by  implanting  ions  on  the  semiconductor  surface  by  bombarding  the
silicon lattice with high-energy ions. The implanted ions lie in a very shallow layer along the surface (0.1 to
0.8 mm). For similar thicknesses ion-implanted resistors yield sheet resistivities 20 times greater than diffused
resistors.  Table  1.3  shows  typical  properties  of  diffused,  bulk,  pinched,  and  ion-implanted  resistors.  Typical
sheet resistance values range from 80 to 250 W/square.
