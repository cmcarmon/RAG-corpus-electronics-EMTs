Instrumentation required for EEG recordings can be simple or elaborate [Kondraski, 1986]. (Note: Although
the  discussion  presented  in  this  section  is  for  a  single-channel  system  it  can  be  extended  to  simultaneous
multichannel recordings simply by multiplying the hardware by the number of channels required. In cases that
do not require true simultaneous recordings, special electrode selector panels can minimize hardware require-
ments.) Any EEG system consists of electrodes, ampliﬁers (with appropriate ﬁlters) and a recording device.
