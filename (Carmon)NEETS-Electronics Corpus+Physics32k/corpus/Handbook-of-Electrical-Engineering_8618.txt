In Table 87.2, formats 1.4 and 1.5 and the entries in 4 require some expansion. The others will be clear in
the  examples  we  will  present.  Base-index  addressing  is  the  mechanism  for  dealing  with  subscripts.  The  base
points at the starting point of a data structure, such as a string or a vector; the index measures the offset from
the start of the structure to the element in question. For most machines, the index is simply a separate register
which counts the bytes from the base to the item in question. If the items in the list are 4 bytes long, then to
increment the index, you add 4. While that is not hard to remember, the VAX does its multiplication by the
item length for you. Furthermore, it allows you to index any form of address that you can write. To show you
what that means, consider expanding numbers stored in words into numbers stored in longwords. The extension
is to preserve sign. The VAX provides speciÔ¨Åc instructions for conversions. If we were moving these words in
one array to longwords in another array, we would write:
