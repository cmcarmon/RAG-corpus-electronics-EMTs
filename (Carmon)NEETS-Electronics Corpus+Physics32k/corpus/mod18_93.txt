REFRACTION is the bending of electromagnetic waves caused by a change in the density of the
medium through which the waves are passing. A visible example of electromagnetic refraction is the
apparent displacement of underwater objects caused by the bending of light as it passes from the
atmosphere into the water. An INDEX OF REFRACTION has been established which indicates the
degree of refraction, or bending, caused by different substances. Because the density of the atmosphere
changes with altitude, the index of refraction changes gradually with height.
