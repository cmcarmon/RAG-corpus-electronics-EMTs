A simple free body diagram, shown above, of a block on a ramp illustrates this.
All external supports and structures have been replaced by the forces they generate. These include:
mg: the product of the mass of the block and the constant of gravitation acceleration: its weight.
N: the normal force of the ramp.
Ff: the friction force of the ramp.

The force vectors show direction and point of application and are labeled with their magnitude.
It contains a coordinate system that can be used when describing the vectors.
Some care is needed in interpreting the diagram.
The normal force has been shown to act at the midpoint of the base, but if the block is in static equilibrium its true location is directly below the center of mass, where the weight acts, because that is necessary to compensate for the moment of the friction.
Unlike the weight and normal force, which are expected to act at the tip of the arrow, the friction force is a sliding vector and thus the point of application is not relevant, and the friction acts all along the whole base.
