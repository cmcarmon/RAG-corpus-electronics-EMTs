3. If the wires offer nonzero resistance, then, as described in Section 1.6, we can separate each wire
into an ideal wire connected in series with a resistor.
4. In general, the voltage and current can be time varying and can be represented in a more general
form as V(t) and I(t). For devices with more than two terminals, the voltages are defined for any
terminal with respect to any other reference terminal, and the currents are defined flowing into
each of the terminals.
