where L is the maximum value of the mutual in-
ductance, and θ is the angle between the magnetic
axes of the stator a-phase winding and the rotor
ﬁeld winding.
(a) Let the instantaneous currents be ia, ib, and if
in the respective windings. Obtain a general
expression for the electromagnetic torque Te
in terms of these currents, angle θ, and L.
(b) Let the stator windings carry balanced two-
phase currents given by ia = Ia cos ωt, and
ib = Ia sin ωt, and let the rotor winding be
excited by a constant direct current If. Let the
rotor revolve at synchronous speed so that its
instantaneous angular position θ is given by
θ = ωt+δ. Derive the torque expression un-
der these conditions and describe its nature.
(c) For conditions of part (b), neglect the re-
sistance of the stator windings. Obtain the
volt–ampere equations at the terminals of
stator phases a and b, and identify the speed–
voltage terms.
