with the terms in (13.8) representing generalized Early voltages for channel length modulation (CLM), drain-
induced barrier lowering (DIBL), and hot carrier effects (HCE). This formulation is more physically appealing
than the one used in BSIM2, making it easier to ﬁt 1/Gds vs. Vds curves with BSIM2. Figures 13.17 and 13.18
show how BSIM3 typically ﬁts Ids vs. Vds and 1/Gds vs. Vds .
