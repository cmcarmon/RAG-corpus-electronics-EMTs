Once a codeword has been chosen by the encoder, the channel probabilistic mechanisms govern the distortion
suffered by the transmitted signal. The role of the decoder is to recover the transmitted binary string (message)
upon reception of the channel-distorted version of the transmitted codeword. To that end, the decoder knows
the codebook used by the encoder. For most channels (including those above) there is a nonzero probability
that the best decoder (maximum likelihood decoder) selects the wrong message. Thus, for a given channel the
two ﬁgures of merit and of interest are the rate and the probability of error. The higher the tolerated probability
of error, the higher the allowed rate; however, computing the exact tradeoff is a formidable task unless the code
size either is very small or tends to inﬁnity. The latter case was the one considered by Shannon and treated in
the following section.
