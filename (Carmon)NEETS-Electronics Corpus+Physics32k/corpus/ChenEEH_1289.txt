. DVD-rewritable (DVD-RAM) is new type of rewritable
DVD that provides much greater data storage than today’s
CD-RW systems. A single-sided, single-layer DVD-RAM
has a capacity of 2.6 GB, and a single-sided, single-layer
DVD-RAM has a capacity of 5.2 GB. This allows an hour of
MPEG-2 video, which is not very practical for home en-
tertainment use when videotapes can have a capacity of up
to 5 hr (standard play). This DVD-RAM speciﬁcation is
therefore aimed at the computer market where it can be
used to store large amounts of data.
