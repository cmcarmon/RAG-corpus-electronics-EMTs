It is worth dwelling on a couple of the ‘‘key moves’’ of our intuitive method.
The basic approach is to first collapse, then expand. Notice that our first move
was to collapse a set of resistances into a single equivalent resistance. Then, we
found the current into the equivalent resistance. Finally, we took an expanded
view of the two resistances to determine the specific voltage of interest.
