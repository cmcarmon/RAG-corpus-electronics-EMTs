Clever design can reduce CD. For example, various raised-drain designs reduce the drain-to-body capacitance
by  separating  much  of  the  drain  area  from  the  body  using  a  thick  oxide  layer.  The  contribution  to  drain
capacitance stemming from the sidewall depletion-layer width next to the channel region is more difﬁcult to
handle, because the sidewall depletion layer is deliberately reduced during miniaturization to avoid short-channel
effects,  that  is,  drain  inﬂuence  upon  the  channel  in  competition  with  gate  control.  As  a  result  this  sidewall
contribution  to  the  drain  capacitance  tends  to  increase  with  miniaturization  unless  junction  depth  can  be
shrunk.
