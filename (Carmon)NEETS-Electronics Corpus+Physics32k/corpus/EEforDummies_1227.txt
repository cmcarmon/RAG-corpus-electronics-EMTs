Whether the transistor is on (conducting) or off (nonconducting) depends 
on what’s happening at the base (left terminal) of the transistor. The base 
voltage is controlled by a voltage divider (see Chapter 6 for details), which 
consists of the potentiometer (R1) and the photoresistor. To turn Q1 on, the 
voltage at its base must go low (see Chapter 11 for details of PNP transistor 
operation). With little or no light present, the resistance of the photoresistor 
is very high, so the voltage at the base of transistor Q1 is high and Q1 is off. 
When light hits the photoresistor, its resistance decreases, the voltage at the 
base of Q1 goes low, and the transistor is on.
