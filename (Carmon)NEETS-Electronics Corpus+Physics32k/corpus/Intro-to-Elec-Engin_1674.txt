(a) Assuming the system to be initially at rest, for e = u(t), Ô¨Ånd the complete solution for
(b) With the feedback loop connected and with a forcing function of a unit step, i.e., R(s) =
1/s, describe the nature of the dynamic response of the controlled variable by working
with the differential equation for the closed-loop system, without obtaining a formal
solution for c(t).
