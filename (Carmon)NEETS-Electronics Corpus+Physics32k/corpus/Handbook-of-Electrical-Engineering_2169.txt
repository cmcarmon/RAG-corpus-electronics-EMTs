As we know in engineering, the size of the memory is fundamental to identify, for instance, an unknown
plant  or  to  perform  prediction  with  a  small  error.  But  note  now  that  with  the  focused  TLN  the  models  for
system identiﬁcation become nonlinear (i.e., nonlinear moving average — NMA).
