To establish a standard convention to describe attitudes, it is required to establish at least the axes of the reference system and the axes of the rigid body or vehicle. When an ambiguous notation system is used (such as Euler angles) also the used convention should be stated. Nevertheless, most used notations (matrices and quaternions) are unambiguous.

Tait–Bryan angles are often used to describe a vehicle's attitude with respect to a chosen reference frame, though any other notation can be used. The positive x-axis in vehicles points always in the direction of movement. For positive y- and z-axis, we have to face two different conventions:
In case of land vehicles like cars, tanks etc., which use the ENU-system (East-North-Up) as external reference (world frame), the vehicle's positive y- or pitch axis always points to its left, and the positive z- or yaw axis always points up.
By contrast, in case of air and sea vehicles like submarines, ships, airplanes etc., which use the NED-system (North-East-Down) as external reference (world frame), the vehicle's positive y- or pitch axis always points to its right, and its positive z- or yaw axis always points down.
Finally, in case of space vehicles like space shuttles etc., a modification of the latter convention is used, where the vehicle's positive y- or pitch axis again always points to its right, and its positive z- or yaw axis always points down, but “down” now may have two different meanings: If a so-called local frame is used as external reference, its positive z-axis points “down” to the center of the earth as it does in case of the earlier mentioned NED-system, but if the inertial frame is used as reference, its positive z-axis will point now to the North Celestial Pole, and its positive x-axis to the Vernal Equinox or some other reference meridian.
