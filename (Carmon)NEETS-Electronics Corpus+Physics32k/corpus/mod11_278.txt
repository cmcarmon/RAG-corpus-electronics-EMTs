The effectiveness of an antenna depends upon its ability to couple or radiate energy into the air. An 
efficient antenna is one which wastes very little energy during the radiation process. The efficiency of an 
antenna is usually referred to as the POWER GAIN or POWER RATIO as compared to a standard 
reference antenna. The power gain of an antenna is a ratio of the radiated power to that of the reference 
antenna, which is usually a basic dipole. Both antennas must be fed rf energy in the same manner and 
must be in the same position when the energy is radiated. The power gain of a single dipole without a 
reflector is unity (one). An array of several dipoles in the same position as the single dipole, and fed with 
the same line, has a power gain of more than one.
