Two primary standard audio-frequency tones (440 Hz and 600 Hz) are broadcast on all WWV and 
WWVH carrier frequencies. In the absence of a message, a 500-Hz tone is broadcast during the message 
interval. The 440-Hz signal that denotes the 1-hour mark is the standard musical pitch, A above middle C. 
The 600-Hz tone provides a frequency standard for checking the 60-Hz power-line frequency.
