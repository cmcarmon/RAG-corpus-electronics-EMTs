Yet another paradigm used as the basis of modern languages such as C++ and Object Pascal is the object-
oriented  programming  (OOP)  paradigm  [Budd,  1991].  OOP  merges  data  and  procedural  abstractions  into  a
single concept. In OOP, an object has both storage capacity and algorithmic functionality. These two abstractions
are encapsulated in a construct called a class. One or more objects can be created by cloning the class. Thus,
an object is deÔ¨Åned as an instance of a class [Lewis, 1991].
