thus available for conduction eﬀectively limits the power-handling capability of MOSFET
devices to less than 1 W. More recently, new designs and manufacturing techniques have
been developed to produce a more complicated, three-dimensional gate structure. These
transistors are identiﬁed by various manufactures as HEXFET, VMOS, or DMOS, depend-
ing on the geometry of the gate structure: respectively hexagonal, V-shaped, or D-shaped.
They feature power dissipations exceeding 100 W and excellent high-frequency operation.
In contrast to the normal MOSFET, these devices have a much larger forward transconduc-
tance. These devices thus feature very high current gain at both high frequency and high
power, a combination that is hard to obtain with traditional bipolar power transistors.
