A scanned grid approach is used to determine the location of the cursor. As in the electromagnetic tablet,
  grid  of  conductors  is  embedded  in  the  tablet,  with  semiconductor  switches  on  each  line  providing
X–Y
an 
contact on a scanned basis. The charge ﬂowing from each capacitance is summed through a summing ampliﬁer
 lines, as they are
as shown in Fig. 89.5(b). The resultant voltage peaks twice, once for the 
scanned. The peak positions are digitized by means of a counter that starts at the beginning of the scan, and
runs at some multiple of the scan rate. The digital values represent the coordinates of the cursor location.
