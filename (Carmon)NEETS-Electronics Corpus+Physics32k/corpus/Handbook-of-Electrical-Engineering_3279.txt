Thermal Sources
Objects  emit  and  absorb  radiation,  and  as  their  temperature  is  increased  the  amount  of  radiation  emitted
increases. In addition, the spectral distribution changes, with proportionally more radiation emitted at shorter
wavelengths. A blackbody is deﬁned as a surface which absorbs all radiation incident upon it, and Kirchhoff ’s
law of radiation is given by
