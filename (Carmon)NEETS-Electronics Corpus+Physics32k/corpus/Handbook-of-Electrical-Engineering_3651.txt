Ferromagnetism and Ferrimagnetism
To  develop  technologically  useful  materials,  we  need  an  additional  force  that  ensures  that  the  spins  of  the
outermost (or almost outermost) electrons are mutually parallel. Slater showed that in iron, cobalt, and nickel
this could happen if the distance apart of the atoms (D) was more than 1.5 times the diameter of the 3d electron
shell (d). (These are the electrons, near the outside of atoms of iron, cobalt, and nickel, that are responsible for
the  strong  paramagnetic  moment  of  the  atoms.  Paramagnetism  of  the  atoms  is  an  essential  prerequisite  for
ferro- or ferrimagnetism in a material.)
