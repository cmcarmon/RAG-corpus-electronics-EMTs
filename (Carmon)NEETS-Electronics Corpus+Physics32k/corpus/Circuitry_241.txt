(typically less than 6 V). A similar effect occurs in 
less heavily doped diodes. These avalanche diodes 
also  exhibit  a  rapid  breakdown  with  negligible 
current flowing below the avalanche voltage and an 
increasingly 
the 
avalanche voltage has been reached. For avalanche 
diodes,  this  breakdown  voltage  usually  occurs  at 
voltages  above  6  V.  In  practice,  however,  both 
types  of  diode  are  referred  to  as  zener  diodes.  A 
typical  characteristic  for  a  12  V  zener  diode  is 
shown in Fig. 5.10.  
  Whereas 
is  a  highly 
undesirable effect in circuits  that use conventional 
diodes,  it  can  be  extremely  useful  in  the  case  of 
zener  diodes  where  the  breakdown  voltage  is 
precisely  known.  When  a  diode  is  undergoing 
reverse  breakdown  and  provided  its  maximum 
ratings  are  not  exceeded  the  voltage  appearing 
across it will remain substantially constant (equal to 
the nominal zener voltage) regardless of the current 
flowing. This property makes the zener diode ideal 
for use as a voltage regulator (see Chapter 6). 
  Zener  diodes  are  available  in  various  families 
(according 
characteristics, 
encapsulation  and  power  ratings)  with  reverse 
breakdown  (zener)  voltages  in  the  E12  and  E24 
series  (ranging  from  2.4  V  to  91  V).  Table  5.2 
summarizes  the  characteristics  of  common  zener 
diodes. 
  Figure  5.11  shows  a  test  circuit  for  obtaining 
zener  diode  characteristics.  The  circuit  is  shown 
with  the  diode  connected  in  the  forward  direction 
and it must be reverse connected in order to obtain 
the reverse characteristic. Finally, it is important to 
note  that,  when  used  as  a  voltage  regulator,  the 
cathode connection is the more positive terminal.
