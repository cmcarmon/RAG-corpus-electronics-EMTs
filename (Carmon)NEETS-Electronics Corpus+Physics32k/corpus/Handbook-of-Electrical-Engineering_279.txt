The circuits examined thus far have contained only current
sources and resistors. In order to expand our capabilities, we
next examine a circuit containing voltage sources. The circuit
shown in Fig. 3.5 has three nonreference nodes labeled V1, V2,
and V3. However, we do not have three unknown node volt-
ages. Since known voltage sources exist between the reference
node and nodes V1 and V3, these two node voltages are known, i.e., V1 = 12 V and V3 = â€“4 V. Therefore, we
have only one unknown node voltage, V2. The equations for this network are then
