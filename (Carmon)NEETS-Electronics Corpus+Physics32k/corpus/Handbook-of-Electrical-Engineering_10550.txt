Illumination Computational Methods
Zonal Cavity Method.
Introduced in 1964, the zonal cavity method of performing lighting computations has
gained  rapid  acceptance  as  the  preferred  way  to  calculate  number  and  placement  of  luminaires  required  to
satisfy a speciÔ¨Åed illuminance level requirement. Zonal cavity provides a higher degree of accuracy than does
the old lumen method, because it gives individual consideration to factors that are glossed over empirically in
the lumen method.
