As you may have guessed, the turbine-driven rotor shown in figure 3-4, view A, is used when the
prime mover is a high-speed turbine. The windings in the turbine-driven rotor are arranged to form two or
four distinct poles. The windings are firmly embedded in slots to withstand the tremendous centrifugal
forces encountered at high speeds.
