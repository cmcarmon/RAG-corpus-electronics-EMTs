The FM method of encoding digital data onto a disk uses two pulse periods to represent each bit of 
data (a pulse period is the time span of one pulse). The first pulse period always contains a clock pulse. 
The second pulse-period may, or may not, contain a data pulse. If the digital data is a "1," a data pulse 
will be present in the second pulse-period. But, if the digital data is a "0," then there's no pulse present. 
Figure 8-7 shows this. The clock pulse, which is always present, tells the disk drive's interface that the 
next pulse is a data pulse. It is used to compensate for changes in the disk's rotation speed.
