In theory, quadrature (or offset quadrature) phase shift
keying systems can improve the spectral efﬁciency of mobile
communication. They do, however, require a coherent de-
tector, and in a multipath fading environment, the use of
coherent detection is difﬁcult and often results in poor per-
formance over noncoherently based systems. The coherent
detection problem can be overcome by using a differential
detector, but then OQPSK is subject to intersymbol interfer-
ence that results in poor system performance. The spectrum of
offset QPSK (OQPSK) is the following (Proakis, 1989):
