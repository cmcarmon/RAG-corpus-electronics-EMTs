Given a signal that has been collected or computed using a process that eliminates or minimizes aliasing from
components above the Nyquist frequency (one-half the sampling frequency), we have a great deal of ﬂexibility
in  modifying  the  sampling  rate.  For  example,  if  the  frequency  content  of  the  signal  is  much  lower  than  the
Nyquist  frequency,  then  the  sampling  rate  can  be  reduced  without  losing  any  of  the  signal  content.  This
“decimation” process allows us to compress the signal into a form that requires less memory requirements. An
“interpolation” process can be used to interpolate new data points between points of the decimated signal in
such  a  way  that  the  frequency  content  of  the  new  signal  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  original  signal.  The
  such  as  a  factor  of  3.  The
decimation  process  requires  a  reduction  of  data  points  by  an  integer  factor,
