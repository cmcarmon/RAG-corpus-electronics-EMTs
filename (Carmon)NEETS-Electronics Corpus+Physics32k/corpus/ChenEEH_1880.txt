The RAB is realized by a radio bearer service and an Iu-
bearer service. The role of the radio bearer service is to cover all
the aspects of the radio interface transport. This bearer service
uses the UTRA frequency/time–division duplex (FDD/TDD).
The Iu bearer service provides the transport between the
UTRAN and CN. Iu bearer services for packet trafﬁc provide
different bearer services for different levels of QoS.
