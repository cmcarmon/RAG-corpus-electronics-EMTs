in a system upon a change in direction. Anyone who’s ever driven an old automobile with
”loose” steering knows what hysteresis is: to change from turning left to turning right (or vice
versa), you have to rotate the steering wheel an additional amount to overcome the built-in
”lag” in the mechanical linkage system between the steering wheel and the front wheels of the
car. In a magnetic system, hysteresis is seen in a ferromagnetic material that tends to stay
magnetized after an applied ﬁeld force has been removed (see ”retentivity” in the ﬁrst section
of this chapter), if the force is reversed in polarity.
