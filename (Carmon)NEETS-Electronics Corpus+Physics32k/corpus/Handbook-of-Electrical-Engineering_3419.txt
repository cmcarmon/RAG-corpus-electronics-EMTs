A/D converter ICs produce digital codes in a serial or parallel format, and some ICs offer the designer both
formats. The digital outputs are compatible with standard logic families to facilitate interfacing to other digital
systems. In addition, some A/D converter ICs have a built-in analog multiplexer and therefore can accept more
than one analog input signal.
