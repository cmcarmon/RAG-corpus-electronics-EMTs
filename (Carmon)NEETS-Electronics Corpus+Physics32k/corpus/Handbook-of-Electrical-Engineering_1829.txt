where l = (2p/k) is the wavelength of the propagating plane wave and u is the angle of arrival at array site as
shown in Fig. 17.23. Note that u is explicitly admitted as a variable in S(k,u) to allow for the possibility that
for a Ô¨Åxed wavenumber, the beam pattern could be plotted as a function of the angle of arrival. In that case,
when u is zero, the wave impinges the array broadside and the normalized beam pattern evaluates to unity.
