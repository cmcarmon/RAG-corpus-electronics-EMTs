Responsivity is the ratio of the optical detector's output photocurrent in amperes to the incident
optical power in watts. The responsivity of a detector is a function of the wavelength of the incident light
and the efficiency of the device in responding to that wavelength. For a particular material, only photons
of certain wavelengths will generate a photocurrent when they are absorbed. Additionally, the detector
material absorbs some wavelengths better than others. These two properties cause the wavelength
dependence in the detector responsivity. Responsivity is a useful parameter for characterizing detector
performance because it relates the photocurrent generated to the incident optical power.
