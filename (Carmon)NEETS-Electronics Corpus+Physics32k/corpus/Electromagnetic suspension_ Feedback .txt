The position of the suspended object can be detected optically or magnetically, other schemes may sometimes be used.
The feedback circuit controls the electromagnet to try to keep the suspended object at the correct position.
However, simply controlling the position usually leads to instability, due to the small time delays in the inductance of the coil and in sensing the position. In practice then, the feedback circuitry must use the change of position over time to determine and damp the speed.
