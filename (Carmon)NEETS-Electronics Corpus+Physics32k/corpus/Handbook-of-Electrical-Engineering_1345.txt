The standardization efforts of the U.S. Federal Government for secure voice channels and military applica-
tions have a historically signiÔ¨Åcant impact on the evolution of speech coder technology. In particular, the recent
re-standardization of the DoD 2400 bits/s vocoder algorithm has produced some competing algorithms worthy
of mention here. Of the classes of speech coders represented among the algorithms competing to replace LPC-10,
several implementations utilized STC or MBE architectures, some used CELP architectures, and others were
novel  combinations  of  multiband-excitation  with  LPC  modeling  [McCree  and  Barnwell,  1995]  or  pitch-
synchronous prototype waveform interpolation techniques [Kleijn, 1991].
