Use of the large-signal or small-signal model depends on the magnitude of the driving source. In applications
where the driving currents or the driving voltages have large amplitudes, large-signal models are used. In circuits
where the signal does not deviate much from the dc biasing point, small-signal models are more suitable. For
dc  conditions  and  very-low-frequency  applications,  dc  equivalent  circuit  models  are  used.  For  dc  and  very-
low-frequency  analysis,  the  circuit  element  values  can  be  assumed  to  be  lumped,  whereas  in  high-frequency
analysis, incremental element values give much more precise results.
