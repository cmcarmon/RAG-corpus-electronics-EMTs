Example 1.2 
 
The  unit  of  electrical  potential,  the  Volt  (V),  is 
defined as the difference in potential between two 
points  in  a  conductor  which,  when  carrying  a 
current of one Amp (A), dissipates a power of one 
Watt (W). Express the Volt (V) in terms of Joules 
(J) and Coulombs (C). 
 
Solution 
 
In terms of the derived units:
