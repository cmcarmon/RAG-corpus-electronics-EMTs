(c) How is such a ROM described?
(d) If each location requires its own word line
emanating from a decoder AND gate, how
many gates would the decoder for 1K-byte
ROM have to contain?
(e) Develop a two-dimensional addressing sys-
tem using a 6-to-64 decoder, a 64-word√ó 128-
bit matrix, and 16-input multiplexers. How
many gates would such a system require?
