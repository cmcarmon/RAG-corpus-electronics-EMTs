If this is the case, what is the use of the emitter follower? The answer is that because the signal current gain
is unchanged at ie/ib = (hfe + 1) . hf e, then the power gain must also be about hf e. This means in turn that the
output  resistance  must  be  the  resistance “looking  into”  the  transistor  from  the  emitter,  divided  by hfe.  If  the
parallel combination of Rg and the bias resistors is RG, then
