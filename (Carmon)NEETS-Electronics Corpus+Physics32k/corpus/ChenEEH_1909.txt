Error-correcting RESO (Laha and Patel, 1983) is essentially
triple-time redundancy. The circuit and its operands are divided
into at least three partitions. Successive recomputations are
performed while shifting the operand portions such that each
portion is recomputed into three different circuit partitions. In
a circuit with dependent partitions, such as an adder, an erro-
neous carry may propagate an error between partitions, making
it impossible for a given portion of the result to be computed
correctly. To avoid this problem, comparison of intermediate
results produces error syndromes that can identify the faulty
partition and allow correct carries to be saved and then rerouted
in successive recomputations. Variations on the technique trade
off additional hardware with a fourth computation. Finally,
correct result portions are located and assembled into a
