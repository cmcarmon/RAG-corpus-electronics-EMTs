When optimum resolution is required, electromagnetic focus is used instead of the electrostatic focus systems
described previously. Because this magnetic focus lens just bends the electron trajectories without changing the
electronâ€™s speed, and because of its large diameter, the spherical aberration is reduced and the spot size is optimized.
