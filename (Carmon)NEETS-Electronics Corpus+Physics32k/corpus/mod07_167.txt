Diodes are rugged and efficient. They are also expected to be relatively trouble free. Protective
encapsulation processes and special coating techniques have even further increased their life
expectancies. In theory, a diode should last indefinitely. However, if diodes are subjected to current
overloads, their junctions will be damaged or destroyed. In addition, the application of excessively high
operating voltages can damage or destroy junctions through arc-over, or excessive reverse currents. One
of the greatest dangers to the diode is heat. Heat causes more electron-hole pairs to be generated, which in
turn increases current flow. This increase in current generates more heat and the cycle repeats itself until
