A Hartley configuration is used for the local oscillator. The oscillator output is equal to the tuned 
frequency plus 2.215 megahertz. Two voltage-variable capacitors are used in the local oscillator to 
stabilize small frequency variations. A phase splitter is used to drive the mixer diodes into conduction 
during half of the local oscillator cycle.
