EXAMPLE 3.1.1
Consider an RLC series circuit excited by v(t) = Vest in the time domain. Assume no initial
capacitor voltage or inductive current at t = 0. Draw the transformed network in the s-domain
and solve for the frequency-domain forced response of the resultant current. Then Ô¨Ånd the t-
domain forced response i(t).
