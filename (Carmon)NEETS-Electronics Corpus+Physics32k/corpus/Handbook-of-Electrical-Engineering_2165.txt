Memory Structures
The  simplest  memory  structure  is  built  from  a  tap  delay  line  (Fig. 20.10).  The  memory  by  delays  is  a  single-
input,  multiple-output  system  that  has  no  free  parameters  except  its  size  K.  The  tap  delay  memory  is  the
memory  utilized  in  the  time-delay  neural  network  (TDNN)  which  has  been  utilized  successfully  in  speech
recognition and system identiÔ¨Åcation [Kung, 1993].
