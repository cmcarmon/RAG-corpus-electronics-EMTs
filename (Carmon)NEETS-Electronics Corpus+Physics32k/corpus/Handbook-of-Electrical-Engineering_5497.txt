It  should  be  noted  that  a  two-terminal
dc system does not need a dc breaker since
the  fast  converter  control  response  can
bring the current quickly to zero. In multi-
terminal  systems,  dc  breakers  can  provide  additional  ï¬‚exibility  of  operation.  The  multiterminal  dc  systems
commissioned so far have not employed dc breakers.
