A transistor model, having the same number of terminals as the transistor, is a collection of
ideal linear elements designed to approximate the relationships between the transistor small-
signal variables. While the small-signal model cannot be used to obtain information about
biasing, the ac device model considered in this chapter deals only with the response of the
circuit to small signals about the operating point. The transistor model is then substituted for
the transistor in the circuit in order to analyze an ampliÔ¨Åer circuit. Under the assumption of
small-signal linear operation, the technique of superposition can be used effectively to simplify
the analysis.
