Path-delay test patterns become much easier to generate and also apply to a circuit if the circuit is designed
using scannable ﬂip-ﬂops that are additionally capable of storing two arbitrarily selected values in them. This
can  be  done  in  such  a  fashion  that  the  initial  value  available  at  the  ﬂip-ﬂop  output  will  be  replaced  by  the
second value when a ﬁrst clock pulse is applied, and the ﬂip-ﬂop will revert to its normal mode of operation
before the second clock pulse is applied. This way the pair of test patterns that form a path-delay test are ﬁrst
loaded into the ﬂip-ﬂops (using scan) and then two clock pulses are applied at speed. The ﬁnal result captured
by the second clock pulse is then scanned out and examined to determine pass/fail status. It is also possible to
get an actual measurement of the path delays by repeating the same test over and over again while systematically
reducing  the  time  distance  between  the  two  clock  pulses  to  determine  the  minimum  separation  of  the  two
clock pulses required for proper operation.
