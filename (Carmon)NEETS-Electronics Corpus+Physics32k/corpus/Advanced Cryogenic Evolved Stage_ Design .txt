The ACES vehicle is "based on a simple modular design" where the "use of multiple barrel panels, similar to Centaur, provides a straightforward means to building multiple-length (propellant load) stages that are otherwise common. The common equipment shelf accommodates one, two, or four RL10 engines. While ACES can start with existing Centaur and Delta pneumatic, avionics and propulsion systems it is intended to transition to lower-cost and higher capability systems founded on the Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF) system concept.
With the addition of a solar power system, the vehicle can remain in space and operate indefinitely.
In August 2016 ULA's President and CEO Tory Bruno said they intend to human rate both the Vulcan and ACES.
