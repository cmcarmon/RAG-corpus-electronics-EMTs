Assume a collection of measured data, m1, . . ., mn. For simplicity, let these measured data values be functions
of a single variable, v, which was varied from v1 through vn, measuring each mi data point at each variable value
vi, i running from 1 to n. For example, the mi data points might be drain current of an MOS transistor, and
the vi might be the corresponding values of gate voltage. Assume that we have a model for calculating simulated
values of the measured data points, and let these simulated values be denoted by s1, . . ., sn. We deÔ¨Åne the least-
squares, root mean square (RMS) error as
