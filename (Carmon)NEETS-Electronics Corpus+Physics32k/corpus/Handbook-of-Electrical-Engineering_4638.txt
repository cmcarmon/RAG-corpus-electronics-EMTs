De equals unity for q = 0 and 1/2 when ka sin q = 2.2. For small values of ka, De is near unity for all angles.
Some  transducers  respond  to  the  gradient  of  the  acoustic  pressure  rather  than  pressure,  for  example,  the
ribbon microphone which works by detecting the motion of a thin conducting strip orthogonal to a magnetic
Ô¨Åeld. Such transducers have a directivity which is dipole in nature, i.e.,
