These two properties enable us to construct a simple algorithm to ﬁnd a “good” quantizer: we start with a
set  of  reconstruction  points,  ﬁnd  the  optimal  set  of  reconstruction  regions  (which  are  the  nearest  neighbor
regions with respect to the distortion measure), then ﬁnd the optimal reconstruction points for these regions
(the centroids of these regions if the distortion measure is squared error), and then repeat the iteration for this
new set of reconstruction points. The expected distortion is decreased at each stage in the algorithm, so the
algorithm  will  converge  to  a  local  minimum  of  the  distortion.  This  algorithm  is  called  the  Lloyd  algorithm
[Gersho and Gray, 1992].
