When  normal  metals  freeze,  crystallization  begins  at  a  ﬁxed  temperature,  the  liquidus,  Te.  In  amorphous
alloys  conﬁgurational  freezing  occurs  at  a  lower  temperature,  the  glass  temperature,  Tg,  which  is  not  as  well
deﬁned as Te. There is an abrupt increase in the time required for the rearrangement of the atoms, from 10–12
s for liquids to 105 s (a day) for glasses. Not surprisingly, this increase in atomic rearrangement time is associated
with an abrupt increase in viscosity, from 10–2 poise for liquids, e.g., water or mercury, to 1015 poise for glasses.
The principal difference between magnetic glasses and ferromagnetic alloys is that the glasses are completely
isotropic  (all  directions  of  magnetization  are  very  easy  directions),  and  consequently,  considering  only  the
magnetic properties, soft amorphous alloys are almost ideally suited for use in the core of power transformers
