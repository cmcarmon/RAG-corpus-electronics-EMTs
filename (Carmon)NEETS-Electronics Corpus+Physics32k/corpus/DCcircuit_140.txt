The power of a mechanical engine is a function of both the engine’s speed and its torque
provided at the output shaft. Speed of an engine’s output shaft is measured in revolutions
per minute, or RPM. Torque is the amount of twisting force produced by the engine, and it is
usually measured in pound-feet, or lb-ft (not to be confused with foot-pounds or ft-lbs, which is
the unit for work). Neither speed nor torque alone is a measure of an engine’s power.
