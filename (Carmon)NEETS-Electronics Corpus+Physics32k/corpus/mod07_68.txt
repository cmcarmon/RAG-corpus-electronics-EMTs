As we work our way down the size scale, we come to the atom, the smallest particle into which an
element can be broken down and still retain all its original properties. The atoms of one element,
however, differ from the atoms of all other elements. Since there are over 100 known elements, there
must be over 100 different atoms, or a different atom for each element.
