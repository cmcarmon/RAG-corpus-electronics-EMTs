function not only of temperature but also of frequency. The familiar  L/R time constant, here equal  to Ls~
o ,
delineates  the  frequency  regimes  where  most  of  the  total  current  is  carried  by  Jn  (if  vLs~
o >>  1) or  Js  (if
vLs~
o << 1). This same result can also be obtained by comparing the skin depth associated with the normal
channel, d  = 
, to the penetration depth to see which channel provides more ﬁeld screening. In
addition,  it  is  straightforward  to  use  Eq.  (53.12)  to  rederive  Poynting’s  theorem  for  systems  that  involve
superconducting materials:
