5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy. You now thoroughly
evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptable
solution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.
6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solu-
tion;  if  not,  then  return  to  step  3  and  continue  through  the  process
again. Now  you  need  to  present  your  solution  or  try  another  alterna-
tive. At  this  point,  presenting  your  solution  may  bring  closure  to  the
process.  Often,  however,  presentation  of  a  solution  leads  to  further
reﬁnement  of  the  problem  deﬁnition,  and  the  process  continues.  Fol-
lowing this process will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.
