A bistable multivibrator is a multivibrator hav-
ing two stable states (bi-, meaning “two”). This circuit 
requires two inputs to complete one cycle. A pulse at 
one input sets the circuit to one of its stable states. A 
pulse at the other input resets it to its other stable state. 
This circuit is often called a flip-flop because of its 
mode of operation (Figure 40-29).
