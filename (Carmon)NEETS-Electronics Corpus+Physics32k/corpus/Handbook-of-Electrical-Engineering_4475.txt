Finite Elements
This increasing use of computer-based solutions has come about largely because of the generality of the ﬁnite
element  method  (FEM).  In  this  method,  the  problem  space  is  subdivided  (discretized)  into  ﬁnite  regions
(elements)  over  which  the  solution  is  assumed  to  follow  a  simple  local  approximating  trial  function  (shape
functions). In the simplest situation, a particular element could be a plane hexahedra deﬁned by its eight vertices
or nodes and a solution of Eq. (44.3) may be approximated by
