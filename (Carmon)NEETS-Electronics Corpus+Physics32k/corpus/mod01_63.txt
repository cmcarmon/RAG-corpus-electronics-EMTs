Consider water, for example. Water is matter, since it occupies space and has weight. Depending on
the temperature, it may exist as a liquid (water), a solid (ice), or a gas (steam). Regardless of the
temperature, it will still have the same composition. If we start with a quantity of water, divide this and
pour out one half, and continue this process a sufficient number of times, we will eventually end up with a
quantity of water which cannot be further divided without ceasing to be water. This quantity is called a
molecule of water. If this molecule of water divided, instead of two parts of water, there will be one part
of oxygen and two parts of hydrogen (H
