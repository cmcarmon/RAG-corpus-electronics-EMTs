Inertial-quality  gyroscopes  measure  vehicle  orientation  within  0.1  degree  for  steering  and  pointing.  Most
accelerometers consist of a gram-sized proof-mass mounted on ﬂexure pivots. The newest accelerometers, not
yet  of  inertial  grade,  are  etched  into  silicon  chips.  Older  gyroscopes  contained  metal  wheels  rotating  in  ball
bearings  or  gas  bearings.  The  newest  gyroscopes  are  evacuated  cavities  or  optical  ﬁbers  in  which  counter-
inertial space
rotating laser beams are compared in phase to measure the sensor’s angular velocity relative to 
about  an  axis  normal  to  the  plane  of  the  beams. Vibrating  hemispheres  and  rotating  vibrating  tines  are  the
basis of some navigation-quality gyroscopes (drift rates less than 0.1 deg/h).
