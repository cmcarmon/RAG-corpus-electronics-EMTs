Linear deformations of elastic materials can be approximated as adiabatic. Under these conditions and for quasistatic processes the first law of thermodynamics for a deformed body can be expressed as




δ
W
=
δ
U


{\displaystyle \delta W=\delta U}

where δU is the increase in internal energy and δW is the work done by external forces. The work can be split into two terms




δ

W


b





{\displaystyle \delta W=\delta W_{\mathrm {s} }+\delta W_{\mathrm {b} }}

where δWs is the work done by surface forces while δWb is the work done by body forces. If δu is a variation of the displacement field u in the body, then the two external work terms can be expressed as

where t is the surface traction vector, b is the body force vector, Ω represents the body and ∂Ω represents its surface. Using the relation between the Cauchy stress and the surface traction, t = n · σ (where n is the unit outward normal to ∂Ω), we have

Hence we can write

{\displaystyle \delta U_{0}={\boldsymbol {\sigma }}:\delta {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\,.}

An elastic material is defined as one in which the total internal energy is equal to the potential energy of the internal forces (also called the elastic strain energy). Therefore, the internal energy density is a function of the strains, U0 = U0(ε) and the variation of the internal energy can be expressed as

{\displaystyle \delta U_{0}={\frac {\partial U_{0}}{\partial {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}}}:\delta {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}\,.}

Since the variation of strain is arbitrary, the stress–strain relation of an elastic material is given by

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}={\frac {\partial U_{0}}{\partial {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}}}\,.}

For a linear elastic material, the quantity ∂U0/∂ε is a linear function of ε, and can therefore be expressed as





σ

=


c


:

ε



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}={\mathsf {c}}:{\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}}

where c is a fourth-rank tensor of material constants, also called the stiffness tensor. We can see why c must be a fourth-rank tensor by noting that, for a linear elastic material,

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial {\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }}}}{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}({\boldsymbol {\varepsilon }})={\text{constant}}={\mathsf {c}}\,.}

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \sigma _{ij}}{\partial \varepsilon _{kl}}}={\text{constant}}=c_{ijkl}\,.}

The right-hand side constant requires four indices and is a fourth-rank quantity. We can also see that this quantity must be a tensor because it is a linear transformation that takes the strain tensor to the stress tensor. We can also show that the constant obeys the tensor transformation rules for fourth-rank tensors.
