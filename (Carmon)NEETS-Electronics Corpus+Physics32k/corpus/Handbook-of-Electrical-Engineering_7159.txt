Time-division multiple access (TDMA) users share a common frequency band and are each assigned a unique
time slot for their digital transmissions. At any instant the DC-RF efﬁciency is high because there is only one
carrier in the transmit ampliﬁer, which may be operated near saturation. A drawback is the system complexity
required to synchronize widely dispersed users in order to avoid intersymbol interference caused by more than
one signal appearing in a given time slot. Also, the total transmission rate in a TDMA satellite channel must
be  essentially  the  sum  of  the  users’  rates,  including  overhead  bits  such  as  for  framing,  synchronization  and
clock recovery, and source coding. Earth terminal hardware costs for TDMA have been higher than for FDMA.
Nevertheless, TDMA systems have gained acceptance for some applications as their costs decreased.
