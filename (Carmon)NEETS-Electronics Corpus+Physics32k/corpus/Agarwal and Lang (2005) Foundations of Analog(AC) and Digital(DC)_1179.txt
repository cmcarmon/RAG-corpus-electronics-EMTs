4. This step is not strictly necessary in our example because all the elements are linear (including the
BJT, since we are given that it always operates in its active region). For linear elements, the small-
signal model relationships are independent of their operating points. Compare, for example, the
small-signal relations for the BJT and the MOSFET shown in Equations 8.62 and 8.10, respectively.
