The spark gap is actually triggered (ionized) by the combined action of the charging voltage across
the pulse-forming network and the trigger pulse. (Ionization was discussed in NEETS, Module 6,
Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes and Power Supplies.) The air between the trigger pulse
injection point and ground is ionized by the trigger voltage. This, in turn, initiates the ionization of the
complete gap by the charging voltage. This ionization allows conduction from the charged pulse-forming
network through pulse transformer T1. The output pulse is then applied to an oscillating device, such as a
magnetron.
