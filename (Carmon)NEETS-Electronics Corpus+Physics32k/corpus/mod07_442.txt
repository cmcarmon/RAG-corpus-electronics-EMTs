Operation of the simple capacitor filter using a full-wave rectifier is basically the same as that 
discussed for the half-wave rectifier. Referring to figure 4-18, you should notice that because one of the 
diodes is always conducting on. either alternation, the filter capacitor charges and discharges during each 
half cycle. (Note that each diode conducts only for that portion of time when the peak secondary voltage 
is greater than the charge across the capacitor.)
