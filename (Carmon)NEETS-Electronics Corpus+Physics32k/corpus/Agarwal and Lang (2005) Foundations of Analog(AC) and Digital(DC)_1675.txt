from Figure 12.4 for the case of a low-level input at vIN1. The circuit shown
in Figure 12.5 contains the series combination of the resistor RL, the capacitor
CGS2, and the inductor LI. It is the interaction of these three elements that
leads to the oscillatory waveform observed in Figure 12.3. We shall study this
second-order circuit in more detail in Section 12.5.
