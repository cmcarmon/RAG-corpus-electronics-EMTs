The breakdown process in liquids is perhaps the least understood due to a lack of a satisfactory theory on
the liquid state. The avalanche theory has been applied with limited success to explain the breakdown in liquids,
by assuming that electrons injected from an electrode surface exchange energy with the atoms or molecules of
the  liquid,  ultimately  causing  the  atoms  and  molecules  to  ionize  and  thus  precipitating  breakdown.  Recent
investigations, utilizing electro-optical techniques, have demonstrated that breakdown involves steamers with
tree-  or  bushlike  structures  that  propagate  from  the  electrodes  [Bartnikas,  1994].  The  negative  streamers
emerging from the cathode form due to electron emission, while positive steamers originating at the anode are
due to free electrons in the liquid itself. The breakdown of liquids is noticeably affected by electrolytic impurities
as well as water and oxygen content; also, macroscopic particles may form bridges between the electrodes along
which  electrons  may  hop  with  relative  ease,  resulting  in  a  lower  breakdown.  As  in  solids,  there  is  a  volume
effect and breakdown strength decreases with thickness; a slight increase in breakdown voltage is also observed
with viscosity.
