If the drum-wound armature were cut in half, an end view at the cut would resemble the drawing in 
figure 2-7, (view A), Figure 2-7, (view B) is a side view of the armature and pole pieces. Notice that the 
length of each conductor is positioned parallel to the faces of the pole pieces. Therefore, each conductor 
of the armature can cut the maximum flux of the motor field. The inefficiency of the Gramme-ring 
armature is overcome by this positioning.
