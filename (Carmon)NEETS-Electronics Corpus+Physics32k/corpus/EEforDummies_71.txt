As you begin to get excited about harnessing electrical energy, remember 
that over 250 years ago, Ben Franklin knew enough to be careful around the 
electrical forces of nature — and so should you. Even tiny amounts of electric 
current can be dangerous — even fatal — if you’re not careful. In Chapter 13, 
I explain more about the harm that current can inflict and the precautions 
you can (and must) take to stay safe when working with electronics.
