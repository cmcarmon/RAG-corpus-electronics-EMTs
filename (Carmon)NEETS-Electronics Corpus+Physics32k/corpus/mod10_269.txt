SURFACE WAVE.â€”The surface wave reaches the receiving site by traveling along the surface of 
the ground as shown in figure 2-12. A surface wave can follow the contours of the Earth because of the 
process of diffraction. When a surface wave meets an object and the dimensions of the object do not 
exceed its wavelength, the wave tends to curve or bend around the object. The smaller the object, the 
more pronounced the diffractive action will be.
