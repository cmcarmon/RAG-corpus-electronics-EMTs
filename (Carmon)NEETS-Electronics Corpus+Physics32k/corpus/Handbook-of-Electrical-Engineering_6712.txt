Figure 72.8 shows an example of how an ISO/OSI host might connect to an ATM network. Below the data
link layer is the ATM adaption layer (AAL), which provides for call control across the ATM network and for
segmentation  and  reassembly  of  frames  from  the  data  link  layer.  The  current  estimate  for  the  amount  of
overhead needed per cell for AAL purposes is 4 octets, leaving 44 octets for user information.
