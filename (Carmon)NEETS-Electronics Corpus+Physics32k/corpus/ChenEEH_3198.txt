The use of nonceramic and composite insulators in place of
traditional porcelain and glass insulators for line insulation has
become widespread in the last 20 years. Such insulators have
several advantages over porcelain and glass insulators, such as
lighter weight, easier handling, better resistance to damage
from vandals, lower cost (in some countries), and superior
contamination performance. Different material families have
been used for the exposed part of the insulator (hereafter called
the housing). High temperature vulcanized (HTV) silicone
rubber, ethylene propylene rubber
(EPR), cycloaliphatic
epoxy, and EVA are among the materials proven suitable for
outdoor use, with the Ô¨Årst two varieties dominating for trans-
mission voltages.
