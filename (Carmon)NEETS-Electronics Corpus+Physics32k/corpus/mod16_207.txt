The decibel (dB) cannot be used to represent actual power; only the ratio of one power compared to
another. To say that an amplifier has a 3 dB gain means that the output power is twice the input power.
This gives no indication of the actual power represented. You must be able to state the input power for it
to be meaningful. In many applications, a mathematical expression represents the actual power, not a
power ratio. One standard reference is the dBm.
