Detectability:  A system is detectable if all its unstable modes are observable.
Observability: A property that in the linear system case depends upon the A,C matrix pair which ensures
the  ability  to  determine  the  initial  values  of  all  states  by  observing  the  system  outputs  for  some  Ô¨Ånite
time interval.
