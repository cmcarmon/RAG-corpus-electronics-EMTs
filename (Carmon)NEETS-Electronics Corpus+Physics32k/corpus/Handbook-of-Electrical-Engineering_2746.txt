E. Veriﬁcation/Simulation of Function Performance: Given the ﬂoorplan, it is possible to estimate the average
length of interconnections among the blocks (with the actual length not known until after interconnec-
tion routing in step F below. Signal timing throughout the IC is estimated, allowing veriﬁcation that the
various circuit blocks interact within timing margins.
