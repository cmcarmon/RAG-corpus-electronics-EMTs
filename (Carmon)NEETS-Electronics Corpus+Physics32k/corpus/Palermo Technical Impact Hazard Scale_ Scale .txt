The scale compares the likelihood of the detected potential impact with the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. This average risk from random impacts is known as the background risk. The Palermo Scale value, P, is defined by the equation:




P

T





{\displaystyle P\equiv \log _{10}{\frac {p_{i}}{f_{B}T}}}

where

pi is the impact probability
T is the time interval over which pi is considered
fB is the background impact frequency

The background impact frequency is defined for this purpose as:

{\displaystyle f_{B}={\frac {3}{100}}E^{-{\frac {4}{5}}}{\text{ yr}}^{-1}\;}

where the energy threshold E is measured in megatons, yr is the unit of T divided by one year.
