In optical recording it is desired to achieve the smallest
possible spot, since the size of the spot is directly related
to  the  size  of  marks  recorded  on  the  medium.  Also,  in
readout,  the  spot  size  determines  the  resolution  of  the
system.  According  to  Eq.  (80.10)  there  are  two  ways  to
achieve a small spot: ﬁrst by reducing the wavelength and,
second, by increasing the numerical aperture of the objec-
tive. The wavelengths currently available from GaAs lasers
are  in  the  range  of  670–840 nm.  It  is  possible  to  use  a
nonlinear optical device to double the frequency of these
diode  lasers,  thus  achieving  blue  light.  Good  efﬁciencies
have  been  demonstrated  by  frequency  doubling.  Also
recent developments in II–VI materials have improved the
prospects for obtaining green and blue light directly from
semiconductor lasers. Consequently, there is hope that in
the near future optical storage systems will operate in the
wavelength  range  of  400–500 nm.  As  for  the  numerical
aperture,  current  practice  is  to  use  a  lens  with  NA
.0.5–0.6.  Although  this  value  might  increase  slightly  in
the  coming  years,  much  higher  numerical  apertures  are
unlikely,  since  they  put  strict  constraints  on  the  other
characteristics of the system and limit the tolerances. For
instance, the working distance at high numerical aperture
is  relatively  short,  making  access  to  the  recording  layer
through the substrate more difﬁcult. The smaller depth of
focus of a high numerical aperture lens will make attain-
ing/maintaining  proper  focus  more  of  a  problem,  while
the limited ﬁeld of view might restrict automatic track-following procedures. A small ﬁeld of view also places
constraints on the possibility of read/write/erase operations involving multiple beams.
