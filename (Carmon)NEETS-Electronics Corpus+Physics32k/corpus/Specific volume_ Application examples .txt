If one sets out to determine the specific volume of an ideal gas, such as super heated steam, using the equation




v
=



R
T

P




{\displaystyle \ v={\frac {RT}{P}}}
where pressure is 2500 lbf/in2, R is 0.596, temperature is 1960 Rankin. In that case, the specific volume would equal 0.4672 in3/lb. However, if the temperature is changed to 1160 Rankin, the specific volume of the super heated steam would have changed to 0.2765 in3/lb, which is a 59% overall change.
Knowing the specific volumes of two or more substances allows one to find useful information for certain applications. For a substance X with a specific volume of 0.657 cm3/g and a substance Y with a specific volume 0.374 cm3/g, the density of each substance can be found by taking the inverse of the specific volume; therefore, substance X has a density of 1.522 g/cm3 and substance Y has a density of 2.673 g/cm3. With this information, the specific gravities of each substance relative to one another can be found. The specific gravity of substance X with respect to Y is 0.569, while the specific gravity of Y with respect to X is 1.756. Therefore, substance X will not sink if placed on Y.
