Parallel-Series System
Assuming that the reliability of each subsystem is identical, then the overall reliability can be calculated thus.
The reliability of one unit is r; hence the reliability of the series path is rn. The probability of failure of each
path is then q = 1 â€“ rn. Hence, the probability of failure of all m paths is (1 - rn)m, and the reliability of the
complete system is
