Essentially, a wavelet transform is an octave band decom-
position in which each band is subsampled according to its
bandwidth (Mallat, 1998; Vetterli and Kovac˘evic´, 1995). A way
of achieving this is to ﬁrst divide a signal into low- and high-
pass bands, with each band being subsampled by two. Then,
only the low-pass channel is again low- and high-pass ﬁltered,
and each band is subsampled by two. This process is recur-
sively repeated until a predetermined number of stages is
reached. For an image, the same process is performed for
