Team Fortress 2's engineer class can build a teleporter that enables his team to travel faster and less conspicuously to the frontlines. It can be upgraded through three levels, with each upgrade decreasing the amount of time needed to recharge between uses.
The teleporter consists of an entrance pad and an exit pad placed flat on the ground, meaning that teleportation is a one-way ride (although during Mann Vs Machine matches, the engineer can purchase a 2-way teleporter from an upgrade station). The teleportation itself happens instantly, with the teleporting person disappearing and reappearing in a flash of yellow light bursting from the teleport pads. If the person can see the entrance from where the exit lies, they will be able to view a silhouette of themselves dissolve into colored sparks that drop to the ground and disappear.
The teleport devices are capable of functioning perfectly even when severely damaged, but destroying either of them completely will break the teleportation link. If a person passes through the teleport when someone else is already standing on the exit, the latter will be killed instantly ("telefragged") by the other materializing inside them. The teleporting person is not harmed by this.
