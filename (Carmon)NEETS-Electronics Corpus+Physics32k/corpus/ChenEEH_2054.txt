Rigid Variables, Rigid Function, and Predicate Symbols
Rigid variables are individual variables that do not change
their meanings during the executions of N. All rigid variables
occurring in our temporal logic formulas are bound (quanti-
ﬁed), and they are the only variables that can be quantiﬁed.
Rigid variables are variables appearing in the label expressions
and constraints of N.
