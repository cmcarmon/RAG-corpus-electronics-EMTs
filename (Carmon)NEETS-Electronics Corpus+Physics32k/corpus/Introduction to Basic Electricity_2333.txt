Because a capacitor can be removed from a volt-
age source and holds the potential of the voltage 
source indefinitely, treat all capacitors as though 
they were charged. Never touch both leads of 
a capacitor with your hand until you have dis-
charged it by shorting both leads together or using 
a shorting stick. A capacitor in a circuit can hold 
a potential indefinitely if it does not have a dis-
charge path.
