At a given time the right side of the generator is positive and the left side negative. Remember that 
like charges repel. Because of this, electrons will flow away from the negative terminal as far as possible, 
but will be attracted to the positive terminal. View B shows the direction and distribution of electron flow. 
The distribution curve shows that most current flows in the center and none flows at the ends. The current 
distribution over the antenna will always be the same no matter how much or how little current is flowing. 
However, current at any given point on the antenna will vary directly with the amount of voltage 
developed by the generator.
