To physically implement the connections shown in a schematic, you typically 
use insulated wires or thin traces of copper on a circuit board. Most sche-
matics don’t make a distinction about how you connect the components; that 
connection is wholly dependent on how you choose to build the circuit. The 
schematic’s representation of the wiring merely shows you the connections 
that must be made between components.
