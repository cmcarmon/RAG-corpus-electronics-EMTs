For hypervalent molecules with lone pairs, the bonding scheme can be split into a hypervalent component and a component consisting of isovalent bonding hybrids. The hypervalent component consists of resonating bonds using p orbitals. The table below shows how each shape is related to the two components and their respective descriptions.
