The voltage follower circuit functions in the follow way: if the negative terminal 
(also the output) is lower than the positive terminal, the gain of the amplifier will make 
the output more positive and thereby bringing the negative terminal closer to the positive 
terminal. If the negative terminal is above the positive terminal, the gain of the amplifier 
will make the output more negative and thereby bringing the negative terminal closer to 
the positive terminal. From this crude analysis, it is possible to see that regardless of the 
output starts higher or lower than the input, the feedback mechanism will make the output 
approach the input voltage. The exact nature of the errors between output and input and 
the dynamic properties of the voltage signals will be discussed in detail in Section 10 - 
Feedback.
