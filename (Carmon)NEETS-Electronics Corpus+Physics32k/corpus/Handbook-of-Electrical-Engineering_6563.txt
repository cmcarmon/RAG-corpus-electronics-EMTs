Many repeaters may be placed in a ﬁber network, extending the total path length to thousands of kilometers.
The advantage of the optical ampliﬁer over the regenerator is its lower cost and improved efﬁciency. The greater
cost of the regenerator arises from the complexity of conversion between the optical and electrical domains.
The regenerator does have the advantage of restoring the signal pulse shape, which increases the system bandwidth.
This advantage is negated by a system propagating soliton pulses, which do not degrade with propagation.
