In most cases, a computer program is used to numerically
solve nonlinear differential-algebraic circuit equations. The
most popular circuits analysis program is SPICE (Massobrio
and Antognetti, 1993; Quarles et al., 1994; Vladimirescu,
1994). The original SPICE code has been modiﬁed and en-
hanced in numerous electronic design automation tools that
employ computer programs to analyze complex integrated
circuits containing thousands of nonlinear elements, such as
bipolar junction and ﬁeld-effect transistors.
