The



P


{\displaystyle P}
-upper approximation is the union of all equivalence classes in



[
x

]

P




{\displaystyle [x]_{P}}
which have non-empty intersection with the target set – in the example,





P

X
=
{

∪

{\displaystyle {\overline {P}}X=\{O_{1},O_{2}\}\cup \{O_{4}\}\cup \{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}}
, the union of the three equivalence classes in



[
x

]

P




{\displaystyle [x]_{P}}
that have non-empty intersection with the target set. The upper approximation is the complete set of objects that in




U


/

P


{\displaystyle \mathbb {U} /P}
that cannot be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to the complement (





X
¯




{\displaystyle {\overline {X}}}
) of the target set



X


{\displaystyle X}
. In other words, the upper approximation is the complete set of objects that are possibly members of the target set



X


{\displaystyle X}
.
The set

X


{\displaystyle \mathbb {U} -{\overline {P}}X}
therefore represents the negative region, containing the set of objects that can be definitely ruled out as members of the target set.
