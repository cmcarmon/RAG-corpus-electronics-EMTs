This equation reveals how the Hall effect can be used to determine whether the majority current carriers in
a  sample  of  a  semiconductor  are  (negatively  charged)  electrons  ﬂowing,  say,  in  the  negative  direction  or
(positively charged) holes ﬂowing in the positive direction. The (transverse) force (Fig. 36.2) will be in the same
direction in either case, but the sign of the charge transported to the voltage probe will be positive for holes
and negative for electrons.
