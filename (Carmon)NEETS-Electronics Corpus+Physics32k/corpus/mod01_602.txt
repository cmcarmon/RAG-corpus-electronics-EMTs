There are several ways to approach this problem. With the values you have been given, you could
first solve for RT, the power used by R1, or the voltage across R1, which you know is equal to the source
voltage and the voltage across each of the other resistors. Solving for RT or the power used by R1 will not
help in solving for the other unknown values.
