The  back-and-forth  tuning  action  needed  to  locate  the  resonance  is  provided  by  an  auxiliary  tuning
device,  which  includes  a  hollow  metal  rod  that  is  mounted  on  a  loudspeaker  outside  the  cavity  and  that
protrudes into the cavity, preferably at a position of maximum electric ﬁeld. An audio oscillator drives the
loudspeaker at a convenient frequency between 30 and 100 Hz, causing the rod to vibrate and thereby impose
a slight modulation on the microwave ﬁeld in the cavity. A diode across the cavity from the vibrating rod
detects the amplitude modulation on the electric ﬁeld.
