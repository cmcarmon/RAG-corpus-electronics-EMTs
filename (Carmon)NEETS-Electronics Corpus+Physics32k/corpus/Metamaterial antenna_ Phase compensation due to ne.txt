DNG can provide phase compensation due to their negative index of refraction. This is accomplished by combining a slab of conventional lossless DPS material with a slab of lossless DNG metamaterial.
DPS has a conventional positive index of refraction, while the DNG has a negative refractive index. Both slabs are impedance-matched to the outside region (e.g., free space). The desired monochromatic plane wave is radiated on this configuration. As this wave propagates through the first slab of material a phase difference emerges between the exit and entrance faces. As the wave propagates through the second slab the phase difference is significantly decreased and even compensated for. Therefore, as the wave exits the second slab the total phase difference is equal to zero.
With this system a phase-compensated, waveguiding system could be produced. By stacking slabs of this configuration, the phase compensation (beam translation effects) would occur throughout the entire system. Furthermore, by changing the index of any of the DPS-DNG pairs, the speed at which the beam enters the front face, and exits the back face of the entire stack-system changes. In this manner, a volumetric, low loss, time delay transmission line could be realized for a given system.
Furthermore, this phase compensation can lead to a set of applications, which are miniaturized, subwavelength, cavity resonators, and waveguides with applications below diffraction limits.
