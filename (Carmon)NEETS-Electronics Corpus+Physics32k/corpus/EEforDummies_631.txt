Transistors are commonly used to amplify sig-
nals. An electrical signal is the pattern over time 
of an electrical current. Often, the way an elec-
trical signal changes its shape conveys infor-
mation about something physical, such as the 
intensity of light, heat, or sound, or the position 
of an object, such as the diaphragm in a micro-
phone or the shaft of a motor. Think of an elec-
trical signal as a code, somewhat like Morse 
code, sending and receiving secret messages 
that you can figure out — if you know the key.
An analog electrical signal, or simply analog 
signal, is so named because it is an analog, or 
one‐to‐one mapping, of the physical quantity it 
represents. For instance, when a sound studio 
records  a  song,  fluctuations  in  air  pressure
