Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit as shown in Fig. 1.21 and Fig. 
1.22.  Before  switching  on  the  d.c.  supply  or 
connecting the battery, check that the meter is set to 
the  200  mA  d.c.  current  range.  Switch  on  (or 
connect the battery), switch the multimeter on and 
read the current. Note down the current in the table 
below  and  repeat  for  resistance  values  of  220  <,
330  <, 470  <, 680  < and  1k  <, switching  off  or 
disconnecting 
each 
measurement. Plot corresponding values of current 
(on  the  vertical  axis)  against  resistance  (on  the 
horizontal axis) using the graph sheet shown in Fig. 
1.23.
