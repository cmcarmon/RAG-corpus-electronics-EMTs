where dm0, m1 is the distance between colors m0 and m1
normalized with respect to the maximum distance. Color
moments have also been applied in image retrieval. The math-
ematical foundation of this approach is that any color distri-
bution can be characterized by its moments. Furthermore,
since most of the information is concentrated in the low-
order moments, only the ﬁrst moment (mean) and the second
and third central moments (variance and skewness) can be
used for robust and compact color content representation.
Weighted Euclidean distance is then used to compute color
similarity. To facilitate fast search over large-scale image col-
lections, color sets have also been used as approximations to
color histograms. The color model used is HSV, and the
histograms are further quantized into bins. A color set is
deﬁned as a selection of the colors from quantized color
space. Because color set feature vectors are binary, a binary
search tree is contructed to allow fast search (Smith and
Chang, 1996a).
