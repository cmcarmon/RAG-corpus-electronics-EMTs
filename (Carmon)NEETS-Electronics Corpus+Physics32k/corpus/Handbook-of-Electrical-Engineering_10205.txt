Assembly Applications
Automated assembly has become a major application for robotics. Assembly applications consider two basic
categories: parts mating and parts joining. Parts mating refers to peg-in-hole or hole-on-peg operations, whereas
joining  operations  are  concerned  not  only  with  mating  but  also  a  fastening  procedure  for  the  parts.  Typical
fastening procedures could include powered screwdrivers with self-tapping screws, glues, or similar adhesives.
In  parts-mating  applications,  remote  center  compliance  (RCC)  devices  have  proven  to  be  an  excellent
solution. In general, compliance is necessary for avoiding or minimizing impact forces, for correcting position-
ing error, and for allowing relaxation of part tolerances. In choosing an RCC device, the following parameters
need to be determined prior to an application:
