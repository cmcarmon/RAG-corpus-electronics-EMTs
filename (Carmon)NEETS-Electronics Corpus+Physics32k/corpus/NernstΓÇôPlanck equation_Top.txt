The time dependent form of the Nernstâ€“Planck equation is a conservation of mass equation used to describe the motion of a charged chemical species in a fluid medium. It extends Fick's law of diffusion for the case where the diffusing particles are also moved with respect to the fluid by electrostatic forces: It is named after Walther Nernst and Max Planck.
