When the geocentric ecliptic longitude of Venus coincides with that of the Sun it is in conjunction with the Sun, inferior if Venus is nearer and superior if farther. Its conjunction distances vary from about 42 to 258 Gm, and the average time between them is the synodic year of 584 days. Five synodic years is almost exactly 13 sidereal Venus years and 8 Earth ones, and consequently the longitudes and distances almost repeat.
The 3.4Â° inclination of Venus's orbit is large enough so that the vast majority of inferior conjunctions do not lead to it appearing to cross the Sun. Occasionally it does so, and with great predictability and interest.
