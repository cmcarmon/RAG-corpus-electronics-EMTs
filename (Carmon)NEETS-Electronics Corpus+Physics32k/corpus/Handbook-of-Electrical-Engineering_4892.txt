imperfections,  and  lattice  vibrations,  respectively.  In  semiconductors,  the  much  longer  relaxation  time  and
smaller  effective  mass  of  the  electrons  makes  it  much  easier  to  achieve  the  high  Ô¨Åeld  limit.  In  this  limit  the
result analogous to Eq. (52.15) is [Blatt, 1968, p. 290]
