The purpose of any magnetic tape unit (drive or device) is to write data on or read data from a 
magnetic tape (fig. 2-17). Tape stores data in a sequential manner. In sequential processing, the computer 
must begin searching at the beginning and check each record until the desired data is found. Like a tape 
cassette with recorded music, to play the fifth song recorded, you must play or fast forward the tape past 
the first four songs before you can play the fifth.
