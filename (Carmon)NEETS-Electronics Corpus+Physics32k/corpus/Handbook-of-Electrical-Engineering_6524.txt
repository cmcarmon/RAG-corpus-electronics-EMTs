Clipping
Even if all nonlinear processes were eliminated, the allowable modulation would be limited by the fact that the
minimum  output  power  is  zero.  Typical  operating  conditions  with,  for  example,  60  channels,  each  with  an
average modulation depth (m) near 4%, result in a peak modulation of 240%. Although improbable, modu-
lations of more than 100% result in clipping.
