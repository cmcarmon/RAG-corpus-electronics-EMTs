where x2/me is nearly equal to 1. Tellegen considered that the model of the medium had elements possessing
permanent electric and magnetic dipoles parallel or antiparallel to each other, so that an applied electric ﬁeld
that aligns the electric dipoles simultaneously aligns the magnetic dipoles, and a magnetic ﬁeld that aligns the
magnetic dipoles simultaneously aligns the electric dipoles. Tellegen also wrote general constitutive relations
Eq. (35.10) and examined the symmetry properties by energy conservation.
