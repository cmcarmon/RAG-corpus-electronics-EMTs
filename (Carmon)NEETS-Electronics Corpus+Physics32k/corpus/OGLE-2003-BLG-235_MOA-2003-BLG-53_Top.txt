OGLE-2003-BLG-235/MOA 2003-BLG-53 was a gravitational microlensing event which occurred in the constellation of Sagittarius during July 2003. The event was observed both as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) and by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics group (MOA), hence the double designation. The source star in the gravitational lens is a main sequence star of spectral type G located around 8.8 kiloparsecs (29,000 light years) away in the galactic bulge. The lens star is an orange dwarf star of spectral type K, which is accompanied by a giant planet.
