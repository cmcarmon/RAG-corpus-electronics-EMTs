The previous subsection presented the most crucial factors
inﬂuencing the data transfer and storage (‘‘memory’’) related
cost. Cost clearly increases when a higher memory bandwidth
is needed. In most cases, designers of real-time systems assume
that the time for executing a given (concurrently executed)
task is predeﬁned by ‘‘some’’
initial system decision step.
Usually, this is only seemingly the case. When several commu-
nicating tasks or threads are co-operating concurrently, then
trade-offs can be made between the cycle budget and timing
constraints assigned to each of them, which makes the overall
problem much more complex (see Subsection 2.5.3). More-
over, in data-dominated applications, the memory subsystem
is not the only cost for the complete system. In particular, after
our DTSE optimization steps, the data path is typically not
negligible anymore, especially for instruction-set processor
realization (see Subsection 2.5.3).
