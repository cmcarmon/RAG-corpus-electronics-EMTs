If you start working on projects involving higher voltage or current than the 
ones described in this book, consult the instructions for your project or an 
authoritative reference to determine the appropriate wire gauge. For exam-
ple, the National Electrical Code lists the required wire gauges for each type 
of wiring that you use in a house. Make sure that you also have the right skills 
and sufficient knowledge of safety procedures to work on such a project.
