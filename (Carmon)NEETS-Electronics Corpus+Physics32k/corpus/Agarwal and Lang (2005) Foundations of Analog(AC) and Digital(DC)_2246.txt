Recall from the graphical construction illustrated in Figure 16.6 (as well as
from the original definition of the ideal diode outlined in Equations 16.2 and
16.3), that the ideal diode has two mutually exclusive states: the ON state, for
which the diode voltage vD is zero (the diode is a short circuit), and the OFF state,
