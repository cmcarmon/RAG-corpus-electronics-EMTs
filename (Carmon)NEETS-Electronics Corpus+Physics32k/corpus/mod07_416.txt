One advantage of a bridge rectifier over a conventional full-wave rectifier is that with a given 
transformer the bridge rectifier produces a voltage output that is nearly twice that of the conventional full-
wave circuit. This may be shown by assigning values to some of the components shown in views A and B 
of figure 4-9. Assume that the same transformer is used in both circuits. The peak voltage developed 
between points X and Y is 1000 volts in both circuits. In the conventional full-wave circuit shown in view 
A, the peak voltage from the center tap to either X or Y is 500 volts. Since only one diode can conduct at 
any instant, the maximum voltage that can be rectified at any instant is 500 volts. Therefore, the 
maximum voltage that appears across the load resistor is nearly — but never exceeds — 500 volts, as a 
result of the small voltage drop across the diode. In the bridge rectifier shown in view B, the maximum 
voltage that can be rectified is the full secondary voltage, which is 1000 volts. Therefore, the peak output
