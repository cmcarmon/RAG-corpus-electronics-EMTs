Connect the positive side to the side of the resistor not connected to the 
switch by inserting the cap lead into a hole in the same row as the resis-
tor lead. Connect the negative side of the cap to a hole in the right‐of‐
center section of the breadboard. Be sure to check the orientation of the 
capacitor because if you insert it the wrong way, you may damage — or 
even blow up — the capacitor.
