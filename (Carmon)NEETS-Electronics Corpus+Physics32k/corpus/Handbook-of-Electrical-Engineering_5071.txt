The  ISE  consists  of  a  glass  tube  with  the  ion-selective  membrane  closing  that  end  of  the  tube  which  is
immersed into the test solution. The Nernst potential is measured by making electrical contact to each side of
the membrane. This is done by placing a ﬁxed concentration of conductive ﬁlling solution inside of the tube
and  placing  a  wire  into  the  solution.  The  other  side  of  the  membrane  is  contacted  by  a  reference  electrode
placed inside of the same solution under test. The reference electrode is constructed in the same manner as the
ISE but it has a porous membrane which creates a liquid junction between its inner ﬁlling solution and the
test solution. That junction is designed to have a potential which is invariant with changes in concentration of
any ion in the test solution. The reference electrode, solution under test, and the ISE form an electrochemical
cell. The reference electrode potential acts like the ground reference in electric circuits, and the ISE potential
is measured between the two wires emerging from the respective two electrodes. The details of the mechanisms
of transduction in ISEs are beyond the scope of this chapter. The reader is referred to Bard and Faulkner [1980]
