The numbers below the uppermost scale are used with the uppermost scale for dc voltage and direct
current, and the same numbers are used with the scale just below the numbers for ac voltage and
alternating current. Notice the difference in the dc and ac scales. This is because the ac scale must indicate
effective ac voltage and current. The third scale from the top and the numbers just below the scale are
used for the 2.5-volt ac function only. The lowest scale (labeled DB) will not be discussed. The
manufacturerâ€™s technical manual will explain the use of this scale.
