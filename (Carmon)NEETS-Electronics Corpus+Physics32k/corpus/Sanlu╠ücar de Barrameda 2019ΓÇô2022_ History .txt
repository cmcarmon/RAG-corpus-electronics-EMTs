Although the idea of this initiative comes from Sanlúcar de Barrameda in 2003, is rooted a century earlier, in 1913, when Genaro Cavestany, land register, promoted and called for this city the celebration of the fourth centenary of that first circumnavigation, as it was the starting point and return of that expedition.
At the time, that celebration did not take place in Sanlúcar de Barrameda, but in other Spanish cities. Since 2003, a group of people from Sanlúcar have been working on getting this time which was not possible then, and now, with more preparation and support, that will be possible. There are a large number of historical studies which prove that the expedition left and ended in Sanlúcar de Barrameda. It was the departure and arrival port of the voyages of exploration, discovery and colonization the Spanish had made by sea since the discovery of the Americas and therefore it was called "the door of America".
In September 2004 this group started working in the draft of this V centenary celebration, presented it to the City Hall and began to draw up a roadmap. In June 2007, with the support from the City Hall and the Círculo de Artesanos the project Sanlúcar 2019–2022 is presented. Between 2008 and 2010 the first acts to claim this event are held.
In 2010, Fundaciónn Eduardo Domínguez Lobato and Círculo de Artesanos, in collaboration with the City Council and the promoters of the idea, grant the first Circumnavigation to Culture and History Awards, being first winners the cities of Sabrosa (birthplace of Ferdinand Magellan in Portugal), Getaria (birthplace of Juan Sebastián Elcano) and Sanlúcar de Barrameda itself (start and end of the expedition trip). Prizes will be awarded on an annual basis to countries, cities and people who had such a significant relationship with that epic.
