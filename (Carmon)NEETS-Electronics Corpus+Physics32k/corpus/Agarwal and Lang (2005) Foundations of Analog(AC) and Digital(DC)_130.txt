If one wishes to increase the current capacity of a battery without increas-
ing the voltage at the terminals, individual cells can be connected in parallel,
as shown in Figure 1.11. It is important that cells to be connected in paral-
lel be nearly identical in voltage to prevent one cell from destroying another.
For example, a 2-V lead-acid cell connected in parallel with a 1.5 V flashlight
cell will surely destroy the flashlight cell by driving a huge current through it.
