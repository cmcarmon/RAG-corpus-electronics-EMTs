In chapters 1 and 2 you studied how to apply intelligence (modulation) to an rf-carrier wave. Carrier
modulation allows the transmission of modulating frequencies without the use of transmission wire as a
medium. However, for the communication process to be completed or to be useful, the intelligence must
be recovered in its original form at the receiving site. The process of re-creating original modulating
frequencies (intelligence) from the rf carrier is referred to as DEMODULATION or DETECTION. Each
type of modulation is different and requires different techniques to recover (demodulate) the intelligence.
In this chapter we will discuss ways of demodulating AM, cw, fm, phase, and pulse modulation.
