In figure 3-27, the flip-flop is in the SET state prior to T0 (negative voltage on the "1" output). Now 
compare the changes in output voltage at each point in time (T0, T1, T2, and T3) with the input pulse. 
Studying this figure should help you understand how the flip-flop works. The positive pulse at T0 on the 
CLEAR input shifts the f/f to the CLEAR state (negative voltage at the "0" output). At T1 a positive pulse 
on the SET input drives the "1" output to the SET state. At T2 a positive pulse on the CLEAR input drives 
the "0" output to a CLEAR state. At T3 another positive pulse is applied to the CLEAR input. This input 
has no effect since the f/f is already in the CLEAR state.
