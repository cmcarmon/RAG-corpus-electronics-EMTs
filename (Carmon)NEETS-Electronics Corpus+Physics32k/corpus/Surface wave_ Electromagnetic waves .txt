Ground wave refers to the propagation of radio waves parallel to and adjacent to the surface of the Earth, following the curvature of the Earth. This radiative ground wave is known as the Norton surface wave. Other types of surface wave are the non-radiative Zenneck surface wave or Zenneckâ€“Sommerfeld surface wave, the trapped surface wave and the gliding wave. See also Dyakonov surface waves (DSW) propagating at the interface of transparent materials with different symmetry.
