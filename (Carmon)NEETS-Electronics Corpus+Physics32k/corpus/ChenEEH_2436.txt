low frequency range (such as a short-wave radio), where the
wavelength of radiation is quite long, a whip antenna of any
reasonable length can be safely approximated as a small dipole
antenna. The metal wire or rod is ideally made of a perfect
metal when the ohmic loss in the metal is zero. In practical
