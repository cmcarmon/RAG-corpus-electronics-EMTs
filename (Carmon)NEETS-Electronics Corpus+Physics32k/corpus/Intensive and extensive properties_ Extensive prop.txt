The IUPAC Gold Book defines an extensive property as a physical quantity whose magnitude is additive for subsystems. The value of such an additive property is proportional to the size of the system it describes, or to the quantity of matter in the system. For example, the amount of heat required to melt ice at constant temperature and pressure is an extensive property, known as the enthalpy of fusion. The amount of heat required to melt one ice cube would be much less than the amount of heat required to melt an iceberg, so it is dependent on the quantity.
Extensive properties are not just dependent on the amount of material in a system; the relation must be additive. If, say, a property depended on the square of the mass, it would not be an extensive property. (Consider a system consisting of two 1 gram weights. The total mass is 2 g, squaring that gives 4 g2. Squaring and summing the individual masses gives 2 g2. This property is not additive for the two subsystems.)
Dividing one extensive property by another extensive property generally gives an intensive valueâ€”for example: mass (extensive) divided by volume (extensive) gives density (intensive).
