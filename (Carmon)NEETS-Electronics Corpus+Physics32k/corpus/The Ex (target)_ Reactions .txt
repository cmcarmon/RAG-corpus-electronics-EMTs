The target became known after another one of Zombie Industries' targets was criticized for resembling the then President Barack Obama. The company had displayed their bleeding targets at the 2013 conference of the National Rifle Association (NRA). Groups opposed to domestic violence criticized the target and started a campaign against its manufacturer. Zombie Industries said that they included women as targets because doing otherwise would be sexist. The company said that it did not wish to discriminate against or promote violence against women. Amid criticism, Zombie Industries renamed the doll Alexa Zombie and promised to redesign the target to make it look distinct from a human woman. The company denied reports that they had displayed the target in their booth at the NRA convention.
