is bias-independent at low-current densities. Employing the
effective emitter dimensions in all geometry-dependent equa-
tions of the internal transistor deﬁnes a procedure for con-
structing a consistent one-transistor model (Schro¨ter and
Walkey, 1996). Merging ITi and ITp together with the corres-
ponding minority charges into single elements IT and CdE
requires a modiﬁcation also of rBi into r
Bi to obtain the correct
time constants (Koldehoff et al., 1993).
