High damping. The ratio between damping and elastic torques can be between 0.2 and 0.7, considerably higher than for an elastomeric coupling.
Wide range of stiffness variation. Stiffness and damping are adjustable independent to each other. These can also be adjusted by swapping spring packs, without needing to replace an entire coupling.
No aging. Unlike elastomer couplings, the materials do not change or wear out over time. Stiffness and damping remain constant in service.
High permissible torques (up to 6,500 kNm) and high resistance to vibratory torques
Unaffected by hot and oily environment
The coupling may continue in service, even with broken spring plates.
Compact design
