Notice that the preceding step is actually two substeps bundled into one:
(1) writing KCL in terms of currents and (2) substituting immediately node
voltages and element parameters for the currents by using KVL and element
laws. By doing these two substeps together, we have eliminated the need to
define branch currents.
