Under the proposals to redefine the ampere as a fixed number of elementary charges per second, the electric constant would no longer have an exact fixed value. The value of the electron charge would become a defined number, not measured, making μ0 a measured quantity. Consequently, ε0 also would not be exact. As before, it would be defined by the equation ε0 = 1/(μ0c2), but now with a measurement error related to the error in μ0, the magnetic constant. This measurement error can be related to that in the fine-structure constant α:

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}={\frac {e^{2}}{2\alpha hc}}\ ,}

with e the exact elementary charge, h the exact Planck constant, and c the exact speed of light in vacuum. Here use is made of the relation for the fine-structure constant:

{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\mu _{0}ce^{2}}{2h}}\ .}

The relative uncertainty in the value of ε0 therefore would be the same as that for the fine-structure constant, currently 6.8×10−10.
