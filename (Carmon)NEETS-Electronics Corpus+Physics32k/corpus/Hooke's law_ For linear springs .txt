Consider a simple helical spring that has one end attached to some fixed object, while the free end is being pulled by a force whose magnitude is F. Suppose that the spring has reached a state of equilibrium, where its length is not changing anymore. Let X be the amount by which the free end of the spring was displaced from its "relaxed" position (when it is not being stretched). Hooke's law states that




F
=
k
X


{\displaystyle F=kX}

or, equivalently,




X
=


F
k




{\displaystyle X={\frac {F}{k}}}

where k is a positive real number, characteristic of the spring. Moreover, the same formula holds when the spring is compressed, with F and X both negative in that case. According to this formula, the graph of the applied force F as a function of the displacement X will be a straight line passing through the origin, whose slope is k.
Hooke's law for a spring is often stated under the convention that F is the restoring force exerted by the spring on whatever is pulling its free end. In that case, the equation becomes




F
=
âˆ’
k
X


{\displaystyle F=-kX}

since the direction of the restoring force is opposite to that of the displacement.
