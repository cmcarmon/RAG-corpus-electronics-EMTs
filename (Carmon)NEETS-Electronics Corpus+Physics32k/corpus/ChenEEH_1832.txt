MPLS also supports label stacking, which can be very useful
for performing tunneling operations. In label stacking, labels
are stacked in a FILO order. In any particular domain, only the
topmost label can be used to make forwarding decisions. This
functionality can be very useful for providing mobility: a home
agent can push another label on incoming packets and forward
the packet to a foreign agent that pops it off and Ô¨Ånally
forwards the packet to the destination mobile host.
