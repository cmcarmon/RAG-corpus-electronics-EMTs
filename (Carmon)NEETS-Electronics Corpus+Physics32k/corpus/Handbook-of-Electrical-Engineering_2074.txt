Underwater acoustic signals to be processed for detection, classiÔ¨Åcation, and localization can be characterized
from a statistical point of view. When time averages of each waveform are the same as the ensemble average of
waveforms,  the  signals  are  ergodic.  When  the  statistics  do  not  change  with  time,  the  signals  are  said  to  be
stationary.  The  spatial  equivalent  to  stationary  is  homogeneous.  For  many  introductory  problems,  only  sta-
tionary signals and homogeneous noise are considered; more complex problems involve nonstationary, inho-
mogeneous environments.
