Theorem 10. Let CT and CH designate the set of all Toeplitz and Hankel matrices contained in the space C m · n,
respectively. It follows that CT  and CH are each complex (m + n – 1)-dimensional subspaces of C n · n. Further-
more, the Toeplitz matrix A T which best approximates A ˛ C m · n in the Frobenius norm sense has the constant
element along its kth diagonal speciﬁed by
