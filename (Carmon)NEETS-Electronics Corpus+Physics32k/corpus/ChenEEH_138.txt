which is a nonlinear equation with the unknown value
v(t þ h). It can be written in the form x(v(t þ h)) ¼ 0 and
solved using the Newton–Raphson method given previously.
Experience has shown that this method works well with small
step sizes; however, large step sizes give results that diverge
from the true solution of the network. Such methods are called
unstable and are generally not used in integration of differen-
tial equations. A better solution method is to use the Euler
backward method for which the derivative is approximated by
a Taylor series expansion around the time point v(t þ h):
