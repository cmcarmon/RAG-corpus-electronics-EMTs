Problem 4.22: Sammy Falls Asleep...
While sitting in ELEC 241 class, he falls asleep during a critical time when an AM receiver is being described.
message signal is m (t); it has a bandwidth of W Hz and a magnitude less than 1 (|m (t)| < 1). The phase Ï†
is unknown. The instructor drew a diagram (Figure 4.30) for a receiver on the board; Sammy slept through
the description of what the unknown systems where.
