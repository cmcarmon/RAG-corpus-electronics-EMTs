Feedback  analysis  uses  a  block  diagram  representation  of  the  system  based 
around the path of signal flow. In this representation, the signal can be voltage, current, 
or  any  other  physical  quantity.  All  physical  mechanisms  and  circuit  networks  are 
abstracted  as  linear  operations  on  the  signal,  which  consists  of  either  multiplying  the 
signal by a constant factor or summing two or more signals together. It is important to 
remember that these linear operations are complex and that means both the amplitude and 
phase of the signal may be modified.
