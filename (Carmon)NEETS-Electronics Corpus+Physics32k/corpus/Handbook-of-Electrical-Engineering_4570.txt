impressive, as illustrated by Fig. 45.3. The curves on this graph demonstrate emphatically the need for Ô¨Ånding
faster ways of performing the model computations, a point further emphasized by the results shown in Fig. 45.4
where the computer time required to solve a reference problem using various standard models is plotted as a
function of frequency.
