The patch has a length L along the x-axis, and width W along the y-axis. The dielectric substrate has a thickness
d and a dielectric constant er, and is backed with a conducting ground plane. With a coaxial probe feed, the
outer conductor of the coaxial line is connected to the ground plane, and the inner conductor is attached to
the patch element. The position of the feed point relative to the edge of the patch controls the input impedance
level  of  the  antenna.  In  operation,  the  length  of  the  patch  element  is  approximately lg/2,  forming  an  open-
circuit resonator. Because the patch is relatively wide, the patch edges at x = â€“L/2 and L/2 effectively form slot
apertures which radiate in phase to form a broadside radiation pattern.
