Recall from NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles, that the DUPLEXER alternately switches
the antenna between the transmitter and receiver so that only one antenna need be used. This switching is
necessary because the high-power pulses of the transmitter would destroy the receiver if energy were
allowed to enter the receiver. As you probably already realize, timing of this switching action is critical to
the operation of the radar system. What you may not realize is that the minimum range ability of the radar
system is also affected by this timing. The two most important times in this action are PULSE WIDTH
and RECOVERY TIME.
