[a] ^ Makeup inexact due to non-zero quark masses.[b] ^ PDG reports the resonance width (Γ). Here the conversion τ = ​ħ⁄Γ is given instead.[c] ^ Strong eigenstate. No definite lifetime (see kaon notes below)[d] ^ The mass of the K0L and K0S are given as that of the K0. However, it is known that a difference between the masses of the K0L and K0S on the order of 2.2×10−11 MeV/c2 exists.[e] ^ Weak eigenstate. Makeup is missing small CP–violating term (see notes on neutral kaons below).
