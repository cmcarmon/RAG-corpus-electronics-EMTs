For periodic waves in nondispersive media (that is, media in which the wave speed is independent of frequency), frequency has an inverse relationship to the wavelength, λ (lambda). Even in dispersive media, the frequency f of a sinusoidal wave is equal to the phase velocity v of the wave divided by the wavelength λ of the wave:




f
=


v
λ


.


{\displaystyle f={\frac {v}{\lambda }}.}

In the special case of electromagnetic waves moving through a vacuum, then v = c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, and this expression becomes:




f
=


c
λ


.


{\displaystyle f={\frac {c}{\lambda }}.}

When waves from a monochrome source travel from one medium to another, their frequency remains the same—only their wavelength and speed change.
