As electrons accumulate on the top plate of the capacitor and others depart from the bottom plate, a
difference of potential develops across the capacitor. Each electron forced onto the top plate makes that
plate more negative, while each electron removed from the bottom causes the bottom plate to become more
positive. Notice that the polarity of the voltage which builds up across the capacitor is such as to oppose the
source voltage. The source voltage (emf) forces current around the circuit of figure 3-7 in a clockwise
direction. The emf developed across the capacitor, however, has a tendency to force the current in a
counterclockwise direction, opposing the source emf. As the capacitor continues to charge, the voltage
across the capacitor rises until it is equal to the source voltage. Once the capacitor voltage equals the source
voltage, the two voltages balance one another and current ceases to flow in the circuit.
