In two-body, Keplerian orbital mechanics, the equation of the center is the angular difference between the actual position of a body in its elliptical orbit and the position it would occupy if its motion were uniform, in a circular orbit of the same period. It is defined as the difference true anomaly, Î½, minus mean anomaly, M, and is typically expressed a function of mean anomaly, M, and orbital eccentricity, e.
