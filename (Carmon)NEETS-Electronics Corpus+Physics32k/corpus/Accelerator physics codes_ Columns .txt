Spin Tracking
Tracking of a particle's spin.
Taylor Maps
Construction of Taylor series maps that can be used for simulating particle motion and also can be used for such things as extracting single particle resonance strengths.
Collective effects
The interactions between the particles in the beam can have important effects on the behavior, control and dynamics. Collective effects take different forms from Intrabeam Scattering (IBS) which is a direct particle-particle interaction to wakefields which are mediated by the vacuum chamber wall of the machine the particles are traveling in. In general, the effect of direct particle-particle interactions is less with higher energy particle beams. At very low energies, space charge has a large effect on a particle beam and thus becomes hard to calculate. The above simulation codes do not handle low energy space charge effects. See below for a list of programs that can handle low energy space charge forces.
Extensible
Object oriented coding to make it relatively easy to extend the capabilities.
