Subgrain rotation is also known as in-situ recrystallization without considerable grain growth. This process happens steadily over the strain history, thus the change in orientation is progressive but not abrupt as grain boundary bulging.
Therefore, grain boundary bulging and subgrain rotation are differentiated as discontinuous and continuous dynamic recrystallization respectively.
