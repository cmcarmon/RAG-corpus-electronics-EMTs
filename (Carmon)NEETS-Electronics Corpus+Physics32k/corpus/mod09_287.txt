A version of a SHUNT-FED HARTLEY OSCILLATOR is shown in figure 2-14. The parts in this 
circuit perform the same basic functions as do their counterparts in the series-fed Hartley oscillator. The 
difference between the series-fed and the shunt-fed circuit is that dc does not flow through the tank 
circuit. The shunt-fed circuit operation is essentially the same as the series-fed Hartley oscillator. When 
voltage is applied to the circuit, Q1 starts conducting. As the collector current of Q1 increases, the change 
(increase) is coupled through capacitor C3 to the tank circuit, causing it to oscillate. C3 also acts as an 
isolation capacitor to prevent dc from flowing through the feedback coil. The oscillations at the collector 
will be coupled through C3 (feedback) to supply energy lost within the tank.
