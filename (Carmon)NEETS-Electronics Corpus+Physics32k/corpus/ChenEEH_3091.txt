The right-hand side of equation 4.1 represents the current
enclosed by the integration path and is called the magnetomo-
tive force (MMF). In electric machines, currents are frequently
placed in slots surrounded by ferromagnetic teeth. An example
illustrating the determination of the MMF is shown in Figure
4.3, where different integration paths are shown by dotted
lines. The MMF corresponding to each path is the total cur-
rent enclosed by the path. If the slots contain currents that
are approximately sinusoidally distributed in space, then the
MMF will be cosinusoidally distributed. In this way, the mag-
netic ﬁeld or ﬂux density in the air gaps of the machine will
often have a sinusoidal or cosinusoidal distribution.
