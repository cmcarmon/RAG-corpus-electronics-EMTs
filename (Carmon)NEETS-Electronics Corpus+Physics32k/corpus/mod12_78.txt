As the applied voltage is varied, ammeter readings which correspond with the various voltages can 
be recorded. For example, assume that 50 volts yields 0.4 milliampere (point a), 100 volts produces 1 
milliampere (point b), and 150 volts causes 2.2 milliamperes (point c). Current through the nonlinear 
impedance does not vary proportionally with the voltage; the chart is not a straight line. Therefore, Z is a 
nonlinear impedance; that is, the current through the impedance does not faithfully follow the change in 
voltage. Various combinations of voltage and current for this particular nonlinear impedance may be 
obtained by use of this voltage-current curve.
