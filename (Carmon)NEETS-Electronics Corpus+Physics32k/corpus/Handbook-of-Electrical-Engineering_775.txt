 in certain frequency ranges and does not attenuate sinusoidal inputs whose frequencies are outside these
for 
ranges. There are four basic types of ideal ﬁlters: low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and bandstop. The magnitude
functions of these four types of ﬁlters are displayed in Fig. 10.1. Mathematical expressions for these magnitude
functions are as follows:
