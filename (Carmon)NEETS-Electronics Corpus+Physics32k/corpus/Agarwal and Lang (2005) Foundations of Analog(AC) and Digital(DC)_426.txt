Let us illustrate the method with an example. Suppose we wish to find
the voltage across and the current through resistor R1 in the circuit shown
in Figure 3.10. Notice that the circuit in the figure is identical to the one we
analyzed in Figure 2.56 using the basic method, and therefore node analysis of
it must yield the results in Equations 2.151 and 2.147 for the branch voltage
and current corresponding to R1. For node analysis, instead of defining voltage
and current variables for each element in the network, we will choose node
voltages as our variables.
