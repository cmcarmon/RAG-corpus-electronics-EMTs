*13.1.13 A dc shunt motor runs off a constant 200-V
supply. The armature winding resistance is 0.4 ,
and the Ô¨Åeld winding resistance is 100 . When
the motor develops rated torque, it draws a total
line current of 17.0 A.
(a) Determine the electromagnetic power devel-
oped by the armature under these conditions,
in watts and in horsepower.
