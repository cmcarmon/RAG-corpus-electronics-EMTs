The ﬁrst etalon-based optical logic device was in the form of a non-
linear interference ﬁlter (NLIF). A simple interference ﬁlter has a general
form similar to a Fabry-Perot etalon, being constructed by depositing a
series of thin layers of transparent material of various refractive indices
on a transparent substrate. The ﬁrst several layers deposited form a stack
of alternating high and low refractive indices, all of optical thickness equal
to one quarter of the operating wavelength. The next layer is a low integer
(1–20)  number  of  half  wavelengths  thick  and  ﬁnally  a  further  stack  is
deposited  to  form  the  ﬁlter.  The  two  outer  stacks  have  the  property  of
high reﬂectivity at one wavelength, thus playing the role of mirrors forming a cavity. A high ﬁnesse cavity is
usually formed when both mirrors are identical, i.e., of equal reﬂectivity. However, unlike a Fabry-Perot etalon
with a nonabsorptive material in the cavity, matched (equal) stack reﬂectivities do not give the optimum cavity
design to minimize switch power because of the absorption in the spacer (which may be necessary to induce
nonlinearity). A balanced design which takes into account the effective decrease in back mirror reﬂectivity due
to the double pass through the absorbing cavity is preferable and also results in greater contrast between bistable
states.  The  balanced  design  is  easily  achieved  by  varying  one  or  all  of  the  available  parameters:  number  of
periods, thickness and refractive index of each layer within either stack.
