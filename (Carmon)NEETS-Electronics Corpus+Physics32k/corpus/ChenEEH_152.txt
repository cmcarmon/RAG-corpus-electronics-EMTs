The passive elements are inductors (L), capacitors (C), and
resistors (R). Resistance of the resistor is measured in ohms. Its
inverse value is a conductance, G ¼ 1=R. For inductors and
capacitors, we use the Laplace transform; in such a case, we
these elements: ZL ¼ sL and
speak about
ZC ¼ 1=sC. The inverse of the impedance is the admittance,
YC ¼ sC and YL ¼ 1=sL. The subscripts used here are for
clariﬁcation only and are usually not used. Symbols for these
elements are in Figure 4.1. Such networks have two terminals,
sometimes called a port. Notice the voltage signs and positive
directions of the currents. This is an important convention
because it is also valid for independent voltage and current
sources, shown in Figure 4.2. We use the letter E for the
independent voltage source and the letter J for the independent
current source to distinguish them from voltages and currents
anywhere inside the network.
