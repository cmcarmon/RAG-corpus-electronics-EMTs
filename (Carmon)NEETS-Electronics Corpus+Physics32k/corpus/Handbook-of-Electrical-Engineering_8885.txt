A  typical  use  of  a  complex  interleaved  memory  system  is  in  a  vector  processor.  In  a  vector  processor,  the
processing units operate on a vector, for example a portion of a row or a column of a matrix. If consecutive
elements of a vector are present in different memory banks, then the memory system can sustain a bandwidth
of one element per clock cycle. By arranging the data suitably in memory and using standard interleaving (for
example, storing the matrix in row-major order will place consecutive elements in consecutive memory banks),
the vector can be accessed at the rate of one element per clock cycle as long as the number of banks is greater
than the bank busy time.
