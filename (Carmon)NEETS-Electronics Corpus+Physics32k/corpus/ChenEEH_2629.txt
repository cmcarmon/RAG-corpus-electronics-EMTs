The micromachining process was developed in the study of the
micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) in the 1960s for the
miniaturization of mechanical machines for sensors and other
applications. It can be used to fabricate a number of high-
quality microwave components with the existing silicon (Si) or
GaAs-based process. The Si-based micromachined compo-
nents are attractive because they are relatively low cost. There
are two basic micromachining techniques: bulky and surface
micromachining. In certain microwave designs, nearly lossless
SiO2 or Si3N4-based membranes with low dielectric constant
are used. Micromachined passive components offer attractive
performance, namely ultrabroadband nonuniform line cou-
plers, high-quality Ô¨Ålters, and ultra-rapid MEMS switches.
