Thermal stress is stress created by any change in temperature to a material. These stresses can lead to fracture or plastic deformation depending on the other variables of heating, which include material types and contraints. Temperature gradients, thermal expansion or contraction and thermal shocks are things that can lead to thermal stress. This type of stress is highly dependent on the thermal expansion coefficient which varies from material to material. In general the larger the temperature change, the higher the level of stress that can occur.
