Other Modern Design Procedures
Other  modern  design  procedures  exist;  for  example,  self-tuning  control  systems  continually  estimate  certain
plant  parameters  and  adjust  the  compensator  based  on  this  estimation.  These  control  systems  are  a  type  of
adaptive control systems and usually require that the control algorithms be implemented using a digital computer.
These control systems are beyond the scope of this book (see, for example, Astrom and Wittenmark, 1984).
