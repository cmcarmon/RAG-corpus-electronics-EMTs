Hamiltonian simulation is used to transform the Hermitian matrix



A


{\displaystyle A}
into a unitary operator, which can then be applied at will. This is possible if A is s-sparse and efficiently row computable, meaning it has at most s nonzero entries per row and given a row index these entries can be computed in time O(s). Under these assumptions, quantum Hamiltonian simulation allows
