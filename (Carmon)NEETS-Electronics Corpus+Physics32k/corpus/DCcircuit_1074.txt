Maximum power transfer does not coincide with the goal of lowest noise. For example, the
low-level radio frequency ampliﬁer between the antenna and a radio receiver is often designed
for lowest possible noise. This often requires a mismatch of the ampliﬁer input impedance to
the antenna as compared with that dictated by the maximum power transfer theorem.
