Ladder Transformation
The  other  main  approach  to  the  RC-active  simulation  of  passive  ladders  involves  the  transformation  of  a
prototype ladder into a form suitable for active realization. A most effective method of this class is based on
the  use  of  the  Bruton  transformation  [Bruton,  1969],  which  involves  the  complex  impedance  scaling  of  a
prototype passive LCR ladder network. All prototype circuit impedances Z(s) are transformed to ZT(s) with
