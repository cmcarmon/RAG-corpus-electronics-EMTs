It is common for a manufacturer of through-hole boards to convert Ô¨Årst to a Type II or Type III substrate
design before going to an all-SMD Type I design. This is especially true if amortization of through-hole insertion
and wave-soldering equipment is necessary. Many factors contribute to the reality that most boards are mixed-
technology Type II or Type III boards. While most components are available in SMT packages, through-hole
connectors are still commonly used for the additional strength the through-hole soldering process provides,
and high-power devices such as three-terminal regulators are still commonly through-hole due to off-board
heat-sinking demands. Both of these issues are actively being addressed by manufacturers and solutions exist
which allow Type I boards with connectors and power devices [Holmes, 1993].
