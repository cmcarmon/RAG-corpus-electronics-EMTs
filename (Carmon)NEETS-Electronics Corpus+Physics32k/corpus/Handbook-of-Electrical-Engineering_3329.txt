Image Orthicon Tube (TV Camera)
There are two basic types of television (TV) camera tubes, the orthicon and the vidicon. The orthicon uses
the photoemissive effect. A light image is focused onto the photocathode, and the electrons emitted are attracted
toward a positively based target (see Fig. 31.15). The target is a wire mesh, and the electrons pass through it
to be collected on a glass electron target screen. This also causes secondary electrons to be emitted, and they
also  collect  on  the  screen.  This  results  in  a  positive  charge  image  which  replicates  the  light  image  on  the
photocathode.
