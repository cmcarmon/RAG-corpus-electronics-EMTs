Figure 3.23 shows the simpliﬁed schematic of a self-aligned
MODFET. The current conduction takes place in the undoped
GaAs layer. The n-type AlGaAs layer located under the metal
(Schottky barrier) gate is separated from the undoped GaAs by
a thin undoped AlGaAs that acts as a buffer layer. A two-
dimensional (2-D) electron gas is formed in GaAs immediately
under the AlGaAs. High mobility results from the absence of
ionized impurity scattering in the undoped layer. The thick-
ness of the undoped AlGaAs buffer layer is critical. The buffer
layer must be sufﬁciently thin to allow electrons to diffuse
from the n-type AlGaAs into GaAs. At the same time, it must
be sufﬁciently thick to place the 2-D electron gas sufﬁciently
