which d is the inside diameter of the waveguide.
Beamwidths for the main beam directed along the
z-axis are given by θB
yz-plane, and by φB
plane. Let the circular waveguide, with a 2.5-cm
inside diameter, be expanded by adding a conical
ﬂare to have an aperture with an inside diameter
of 5.771λ at 8 GHz. For L1 = 10λ, ﬁnd:
(a) The horn length L.
(b) The directive gain.
(c) The principal-plane beamwidths.
*15.1.35 A paraboloidal antenna [Figure 15.1.7(g)] has an
aperture efﬁciency of 0.6 and a diameter D =
100λ at 6 GHz. Illumination by the feed is such
that the beamwidths of the principal-plane sec-
ondary patterns are equal. Determine the antenna’s
power gain and beamwidth. (Note that the ra-
diation pattern of the feed is called the primary
pattern, whereas that of the overall antenna is the
secondary pattern.)
