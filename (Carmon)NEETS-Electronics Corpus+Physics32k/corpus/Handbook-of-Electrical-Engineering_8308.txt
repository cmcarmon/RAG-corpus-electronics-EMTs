It should be evident from the simple example of a combinational circuit described above that test pattern
generation for digital circuits can be very difﬁcult and involved. The problem becomes much more complex
when dealing with sequential circuits, where the internal state variables (i.e., bistable memory storage elements
such as latches and ﬂip-ﬂops) must be treated as pseudo-inputs and pseudo-outputs that must be controlled and
observed using the external pins of the component. In this case test patterns become test sequences that must
be applied in precise order, and outputs must be observed only at prescribed times. Thus, the testing of sequential
