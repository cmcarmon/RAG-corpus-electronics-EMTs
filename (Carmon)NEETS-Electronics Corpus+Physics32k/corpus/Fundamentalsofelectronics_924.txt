Exercise 6.34
(Solution on p. 259.)
The ﬁrst deﬁnition of capacity applies only for binary symmetric channels, and represents the
number of bits/transmission. The second result states capacity more generally, having units of
bits/second. How would you convert the ﬁrst deﬁnition’s result into units of bits/second?
Example 6.5
The telephone channel has a bandwidth of 3 kHz and a signal-to-noise ratio exceeding 30 dB (at
least they promise this much). The maximum data rate a modem can produce for this wireline
channel and hope that errors will not become rampant is the capacity.
