Although the FEM is widely used by industry for electromagnetic problems covering the entire frequency
range, there are many situations where special methods are more effective. This is particularly the case for high-
frequency  problems,  e.g.,  millimeter  and  microwave  integrated  circuit  structures  where  integral  equation
techniques and such procedures as transmission line modeling (TLM), spectral domain approach, method of
lines, and wire grid methods are often preferred [Itoh, 1989] (see Chapter 43).
