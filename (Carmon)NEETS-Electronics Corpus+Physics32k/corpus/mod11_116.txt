The reflex klystron operates in a different mode for each additional cycle that the electrons remain in 
the repeller field. Mode 1 is obtained when the repeller voltage produces an electron transit time of 3/4 
cycle. Additional modes follow in sequence. Mode 2 has an electron transit time of 1 3/4 cycles; mode 3 
has an electron transit time of 2 3/4 cycles; etc. The physical design of the tube limits the number of 
modes possible in practical applications. A range of four modes of operation are normally available. The 
actual mode used (1 3/4 cycles through 4 3/4 cycles, 2 3/4 cycles through 6 3/4 cycles, etc.) depends upon 
the application. The choice of mode is determined by the difference in power available from each mode 
and the band of frequencies over which the circuit can be tuned.
