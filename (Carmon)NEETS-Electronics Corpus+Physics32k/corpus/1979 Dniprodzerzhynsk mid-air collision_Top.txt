The 1979 Dniprodzerzhynsk mid-air collision occurred on 11 August 1979 over the Ukrainian SSR, near the city formerly named Dniprodzerzhynsk. The aircraft involved were both Tupolev Tu-134A's on scheduled domestic passenger flights, operated by Aeroflot.
The crash killed all 178 people on board both airliners, making it the world's second deadliest mid-air collision.
The Soviet aviation board investigating the accident concluded that the crash was caused by "mistakes and violations" made by air traffic controllers.
