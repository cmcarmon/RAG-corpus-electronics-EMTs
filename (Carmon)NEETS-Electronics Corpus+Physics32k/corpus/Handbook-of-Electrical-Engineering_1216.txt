To provide a viable method for approximating a solution to the signal restoration problem for nonconvex
attribute sets, we shall now broaden the approach taken. The signals are again assumed to lie in a metric space
X  with  distance  metric  d(x,y).  Furthermore,  it  is  assumed  that  it  is  possible  to  solve  each  of  the  individual
projection operator problems as deÔ¨Åned by
