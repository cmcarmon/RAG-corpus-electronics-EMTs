In Figure 6.44, notice that to obey the static discipline, the buffer must
convert the 1.6-V signal at its input to a 1-V value at its output. In fact, the
buffer must restore any voltage up to 2 V at its input to voltage of 1 V or lower
at its output. Similarly, corresponding to a logical high, it must restore any
voltage above 3 V at its input to 4 V or higher at its output. This restoration
property is key to our being able to compose multiple logic devices together.
Because each level of logic restores or cleans up signals, we can decouple the
noise introduced between each pair of levels. This noise decoupling benefit of
restoring logic enables us to build complicated multistage logic systems.
