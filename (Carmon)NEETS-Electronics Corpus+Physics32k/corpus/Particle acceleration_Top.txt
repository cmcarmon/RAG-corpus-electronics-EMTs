In a compressible sound transmission medium - mainly air - air particles get an accelerated motion: the particle acceleration or sound acceleration with the symbol a in metre/second2. In acoustics or physics, acceleration (symbol: a) is defined as the rate of change (or time derivative) of velocity. It is thus a vector quantity with dimension length/time2. In SI units, this is m/s2.
To accelerate an object (air particle) is to change its velocity over a period. Acceleration is defined technically as "the rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time" and is given by the equation





a

=



d

v



d
t





{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ={d\mathbf {v}  \over dt}}

where
a is the acceleration vector
v is the velocity vector expressed in m/s
t is time expressed in seconds.
This equation gives a the units of m/(s·s), or m/s2 (read as "metres per second per second", or "metres per second squared").
An alternative equation is:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\bar {a}} ={\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {u}  \over t}}

where







a

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\bar {a}} }
is the average acceleration (m/s2)





u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
is the initial velocity (m/s)





v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the final velocity (m/s)




t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time interval (s)
Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, we get a circular motion. For this centripetal acceleration we have

One common unit of acceleration is g-force, one g being the acceleration caused by the gravity of Earth.
In classical mechanics, acceleration
