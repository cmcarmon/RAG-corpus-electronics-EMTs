First, establish the zero or reference position for the unit whose position the system transmits. Then, 
zero the most significant synchro in the system first, working down to the least significant. For example, 
zero the coarse synchro, then the medium synchro, and finally the fine synchro. When you zero those 
synchros, consider each synchro as an individual unit and zero it accordingly.
