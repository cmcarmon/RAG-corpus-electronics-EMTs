FIGURE 24.43 A high-performance n-channel MOSFET. The device is isolated from its neighbors by a surrounding thick
ﬁeld oxide under which is a heavily doped channel stop implant intended to suppress accidental channel formation that could
couple the device to its neighbors. The drain contacts are placed over the ﬁeld oxide to reduce the capacitance to the body,
a parasitic that slows response times. These structural details are described later. (Source: After Brews, 1990.)
