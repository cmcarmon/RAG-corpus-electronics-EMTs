Direct application of the steady-state error for various inputs yields Table 100.2. Note u(t) is the unit step
function. This table can be extended to an mth-order input in a straightforward manner. Note that for eSS(t)
to go to zero with a reference signal Ctmu(t), the term G(s)H(s) must have at least m poles at the origin (a type
m system).
