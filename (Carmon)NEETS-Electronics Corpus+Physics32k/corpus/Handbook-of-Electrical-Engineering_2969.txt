where 
 is the sum of series resistors in that loop with all the capacitors shorted. The load lines then can be
constructed on the characteristic curves as shown in Fig. 28.5. From this it can be seen that to get the maximum
 point, should be located in the middle of the ac load line. To
output voltage swing, the quiescent point, or 
place the
