A typical TBE specification might read "+ / -  100 microseconds over a 10-millisecond time interval
at a tape speed of 60 inches per second, referenced to a control tone." This means that the time-base error
could cause a signal to jitter +/ -  100 microseconds over a 10-millisecond period at a tape speed of 60
inches per second.
