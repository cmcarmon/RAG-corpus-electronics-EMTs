Piezoelectric.  The piezoelectric technology uses pressure-sensitive transducers as the means for determining
the location of the touch, as shown in Fig. 89.15. The sensor is a glass plate with transducers connected to the
four corners. Pressure on the plate causes readings to occur at each of the transducers, which depend on the
location of the pressure. Thus, the controller can measure the readings and obtain the coordinates by means
of a proper algorithm. This technique allows a high-transmissivity plate to be used that can be curved to follow
the CRT face plate curvature, but it allows only a limited number of touch points to be used.
