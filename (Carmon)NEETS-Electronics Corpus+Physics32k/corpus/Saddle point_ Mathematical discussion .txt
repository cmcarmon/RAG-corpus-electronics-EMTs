A simple criterion for checking if a given stationary point of a real-valued function F(x,y) of two real variables is a saddle point is to compute the function's Hessian matrix at that point: if the Hessian is indefinite, then that point is a saddle point. For example, the Hessian matrix of the function



z
=

x

2


−

y

2




{\displaystyle z=x^{2}-y^{2}}
at the stationary point



(
x
,
y
,
z
)
=
(
0
,
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (x,y,z)=(0,0,0)}
is the matrix






[



2


0




0


−
2



]




{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}2&0\\0&-2\\\end{bmatrix}}}

which is indefinite. Therefore, this point is a saddle point. This criterion gives only a sufficient condition. For example, the point



(
0
,
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (0,0,0)}
is a saddle point for the function



z
=

x

4


−

y

4


,


{\displaystyle z=x^{4}-y^{4},}
but the Hessian matrix of this function at the origin is the null matrix, which is not indefinite.
In the most general terms, a saddle point for a smooth function (whose graph is a curve, surface or hypersurface) is a stationary point such that the curve/surface/etc. in the neighborhood of that point is not entirely on any side of the tangent space at that point.

In a domain of one dimension, a saddle point is a point which is both a stationary point and a point of inflection. Since it is a point of inflection, it is not a local extremum.
