Spectral ‘‘valleys’’ (antiresonances) in speech spectra are not
nearly as prevalent or prominent (i.e., they tend to be of wider
bandwidth) as spectral peaks (resonances). Nevertheless, there
are speech sounds for which zeros in the production model
seem warranted both empirically (by spectral analysis) and
physically (by analysis of the anatomy and physiology). The
degree to which the nasal cavity is coupled to the vocal tract (as
a ‘‘side cavity’’) determines, in part, the antiresonance struc-
ture. Generally, any component of the vocal and/or nasal tract
systems that creates a cavity with the potential to ‘‘trap’’ energy
(which is nominally on a direct path from ‘‘lungs to lips’’) will
manifest some degree of antiresonant spectral character. The
spectral dip will appear in the frequency region of the reson-
ance of the trapping cavity.
