The motion of sliding friction can be modeled (in simple systems of motion) by Newton's Second Law

Where

{\displaystyle F_{E}}
is the external force.
Acceleration occurs when the external force is greater than the force of kinetic friction
Slowing Down (or Stopping) occurs when the force of kinetic friction is greater than that of the external force
This is also follows Newton's first law of motion as there exists a net force on the object

Constant Velocity occurs when there is no net force on the object, that is the external force is equal to force of kinetic friction.
