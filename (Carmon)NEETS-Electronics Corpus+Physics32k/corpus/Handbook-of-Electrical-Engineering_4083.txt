All  electrical  devices  create  some  form  of  electromagnetic  energy  that  may  potentially  interfere  with  the
operation of other electrical devices outside the system (inter-system) or within the system (intra-system). Due
to the increasing man-made EMI generated around the globe, allowable limits as well as measurement tech-
niques on RF noise/interference have been set at national and international levels. The Federal Communications
Commission  and  the  Military  are  the  two  governing  bodies  in  the  United  States  setting  standards  on  EMI,
whereas the International Electrotechnical Commission is the ruling body in Europe. These ruling bodies are
concerned with only a fraction of the total electromagnetic spectrum.
