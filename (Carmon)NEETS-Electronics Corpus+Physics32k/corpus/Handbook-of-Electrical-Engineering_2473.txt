Let’s consider an example of a JFET with IDSS = 10 mA and VP =  –4 V. Let VDD = +20 V and IDSQ = IDSS /2 =
5 mA. For IDS = IDSS /2 the value of VGS is –1.17 V. To bias the JFET in the middle of the active region, we will
let  VGQ  =  VDD/2  =  +10  V,  so  VSQ  =  VGQ  –  VGS  =  +10  V  –  (–1.17  V)  =  +11.17 V.  Thus  RS  =  VS Q /IDSQ  =
11.17 V/5 mA = 2.23 kW.
