dures in fabricating a printed circuit board from 
a schematic diagram. It takes a lot of planning on 
the front end to make it look effortless on the output. 
Issues arise on such things as copyright, building 
the first prototype, determining whether the project 
is cost effective, and so on. In the design phase, many 
references are available to help an electronics techni-
cian. Keep in mind that this book is aimed at develop-
ing a background in electronics, not in designing and 
building a circuit from scratch.
