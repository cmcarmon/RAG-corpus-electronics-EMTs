The truncated paraboloid may be used in target height-finding systems if the reflector is rotated 90 
degrees, as shown in figure 3-5B. Since the reflector is now parabolic in the vertical plane, the energy is 
focused vertically into a narrow beam. If the reflector is truncated, or cut, so that it is shortened 
horizontally, the beam will spread out horizontally instead of being focused. Such a fan-shaped beam is 
used to accurately determine elevation.
