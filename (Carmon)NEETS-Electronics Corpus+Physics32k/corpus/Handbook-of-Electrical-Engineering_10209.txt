Inspection
Inspection involves checking of parts, products, and assemblies as a veriﬁcation of conformation to the spec-
iﬁcation of the engineering design. With the emphasis on product quality, there is a growing emphasis for 100%
inspection. Machine vision systems, robot-manipulated active sensing for inspection, and automatic test equip-
ment  are  being  integrated  into  total  inspection  systems.  Robot  application  of  vision  systems  include  part
location,  part  identiﬁcation,  and  bin  picking.  Machine  vision  systems  for  inspection  typically  perform  tasks
which include dimensional accuracy checks, ﬂaw detection, and correctness and completeness of an assembled
product. Current vision inspection systems are predominantly two-dimensional systems capable of extracting
