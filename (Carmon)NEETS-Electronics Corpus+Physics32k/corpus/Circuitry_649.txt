 
The circuit of a simple ohmmeter is shown in Fig. 
14.4.  The  battery  is  used  to  supply  a  current  that 
will  flow  in  the  unknown  resistor,  Rx, which  is 
indicated on the moving coil meter. Before use, the 
variable resistor, RV, must be adjusted in order to 
produce  full-scale  deflection  (corresponding  to 
zero  on  the  ohms  scale).  Zero  resistance  thus 
corresponds 
Infinite 
resistance  (i.e.  when  the  two  terminals  are  left 
open-circuit)  corresponds  to  minimum  indication. 
The  ohms  scale  is  thus  reversed  when  compared 
with  a  voltage  or  current  scale.  The  scale  is  also 
non-linear, as shown in Fig. 14.5.
