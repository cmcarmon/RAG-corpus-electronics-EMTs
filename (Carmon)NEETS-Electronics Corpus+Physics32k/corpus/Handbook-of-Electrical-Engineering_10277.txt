Phase  I  of  the  HSR  program,  which  began  in  1990,  focused  on  environmental  challenges:  engine
emission effects on the atmosphere, airport noise, and sonic boom. Phase II, initiated in 1994, focuses
on the technology advances needed for economic viability, principally weight reductions in every aspect
of  the  baseline  conﬁguration.  In  materials,  the  HSR  team  is  developing,  analyzing,  and  verifying  the
technology for trimming the baseline airframe by 30 to 40%. In aerodynamics, a major goal is to minimize
air drag to enable a substantial increase in range. Phase II also includes computational and wind tunnel
analyses  of  the  baseline  HSCT  and  alternative  designs. Additional  research  involves  ground  and  ﬂight
simulations aimed at development of advanced control systems, ﬂight deck instrumentation, and displays.
