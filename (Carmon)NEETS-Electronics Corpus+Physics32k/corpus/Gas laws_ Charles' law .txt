Charles's law, or the law of volumes, was found in 1787 by Jacques Charles. It states that, for a given mass of an ideal gas at constant pressure, the volume is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, assuming in a closed system.
The statement of Charles' law is as follows: the volume (V) of a given mass of a gas, at constant pressure (Pa), is directly proportional to its temperature (K). As a mathematical equation, Charles's law is written as either:




V
‚àù
T



{\displaystyle V\propto T\,}
, or




V

/

T
=

k

2




{\displaystyle V/T=k_{2}}
, or





V

/


T

=

V

/


T

2




{\displaystyle V_{1}/T_{1}=V_{2}/T_{2}}
,
where V is the volume of a gas, T is the absolute temperature and k2 is a proportionality constant (which is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations in this article).
