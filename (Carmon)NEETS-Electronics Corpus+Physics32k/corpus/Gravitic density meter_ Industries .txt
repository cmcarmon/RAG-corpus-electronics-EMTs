Gravitic density meters have many uses in many different industries. Mining, dredging, wastewater, paper, and oil and gas all make use of gravitic density meters. All these industries need to measure the amount of solids moving through its respective process.
Mining industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of ore being transported.
Dredging industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of debris being moved and carried by the dredge.
Wastewater industries use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of sewage that needs to be treated.
Paper production uses gravitic density meters to measure the amount of pulp currently being used in the process.
Oil and gas use gravitic density meters to measure the amount of oil and gas in the system. This case exemplifies the versatility of gravitic density meters because oil and gas are lighter than water.
