In order to explain the temporal behavior of circuit responses such as that
shown in Figure 9.3, we must introduce two new elements, namely capacitors
and inductors. For example, we shall see that it is a capacitance internal to
the MOSFET that is responsible for the non-ideal inverter response shown in
Figure 9.3. For simplicity, we did not model that characteristic of the MOSFET
in earlier chapters, but we will begin to do so now in Section 9.3.1.
