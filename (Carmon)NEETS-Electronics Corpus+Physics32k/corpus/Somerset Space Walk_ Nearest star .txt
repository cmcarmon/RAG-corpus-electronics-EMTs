The installation does not include a model of the nearest star for comparison, as this would be impossible. On the same scale as the other models, the nearest star (Proxima Centauri, which is about one-seventh the size of the Sun) would need to be a red ball 37.5 centimetres (14.8 in) in diameter sited 76,000 km (47,000 mi) away (roughly twice the circumference of Earth).
