Sometimes it is desirable to change the DC refer-
ence level of a waveform. The dC reference level is 
the starting point from which measurements are made. 
A clamping circuit can be used to clamp the top or 
bottom of the waveform to a given DC voltage. Unlike 
a clipper, or limiter, circuit, a clamping circuit does not 
change the shape of the waveform. A diode clamper 
(Figure 40-27) is also called a DC restorer. This circuit 
is commonly used in radar, television, telecommuni-
cations, and computers. In the circuit shown, a square 
wave is applied to an input signal. The purpose of the 
circuit is to clamp the top of the square wave to 0 volts, 
without changing the shape of the waveform.
