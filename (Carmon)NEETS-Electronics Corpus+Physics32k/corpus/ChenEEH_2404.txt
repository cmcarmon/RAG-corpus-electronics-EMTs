How well an antenna directs the radiation in a particular angle
is quantiﬁed by comparing the radiation intensity with that of
an ideal isotropic radiator. An isotropic radiator is deﬁned as
an antenna that radiates uniformly in all angles. Let the total
radiated power from a given antenna, Prad, also be radiated
