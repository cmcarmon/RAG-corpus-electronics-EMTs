As we discussed earlier, the higher the frequency of a radio wave, the lower the rate of refraction by 
an ionized layer. Therefore, for a given angle of incidence and time of day, there is a maximum frequency 
that can be used for communications between two given locations. This frequency is known as the 
MAXIMUM USABLE FREQUENCY (muf).
