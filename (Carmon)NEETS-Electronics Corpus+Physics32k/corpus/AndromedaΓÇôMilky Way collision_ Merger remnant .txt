The galaxy product of the collision has been nicknamed Milkomeda or Milkdromeda. According to simulations, this object will look like a giant elliptical galaxy, but with a center showing less stellar density than current elliptical galaxies. It is, however, possible the resulting object will be a large disk galaxy, depending on the amount of remaining gas in the Milky Way and Andromeda.
In the far future, roughly 150 billion years from now, the remaining galaxies of the Local Group will coalesce into this object, that being the next evolutionary stage of the local group of galaxies.
