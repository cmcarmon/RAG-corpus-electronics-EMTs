Musical instruments produce complex sound waves containing a great number of frequencies. The 
frequencies produced by a piano, for example, range from approximately 27 to 4,200 hertz with harmonic 
frequencies extending beyond 10 kilohertz. Modulating frequencies of up to 15 kilohertz must be 
included in the signal to transmit a musical passage with a high degree of fidelity. This requires a 
bandwidth of at least 30 kilohertz to prevent attenuation of higher-order harmonic frequencies.
