All substances that are not light sources are visible only because they reflect all or some part of the
light reaching them from some luminous source. Examples of luminous sources include the sun, a gas
flame, and an electric light filament, because they are sources of light energy. If light is neither
transmitted nor reflected, it is absorbed or taken up by the medium. When light strikes a substance, some
absorption and some reflection always take place. No substance completely transmits, reflects, or absorbs
all the light rays that reach its surface.
