Whether a particular material falls into the low-loss or
highly lossy categories may depend on frequency. For example,
consider typical seawater, which has roughly er ¼ 78 (ignoring
polarization losses) and s ¼ 4:0 S=m. (In actuality, polariza-
tion loss also becomes important at microwave and higher
frequencies.) Table 3.2 shows the loss tangent versus frequency.
The loss tangent is on the order of unity at microwave frequen-
cies. For much lower frequencies the seawater is highly lossy;
for much higher frequencies, it is a low-loss media. Note that
the depth of penetration continues to decrease as the frequency
is raised, even though the medium becomes more of a low-loss
material at higher frequencies according to the deﬁnition used
(a low-loss tangent). At low frequencies, the penetration depth
is
frequency
according to equation 3.48. At high frequencies, the penetra-
tion depth approaches a constant according to equation 3.46.
