Here's another rule: A GYRO ALWAYS PRECESSES IN A DIRECTION TENDING TO LINE 
ITSELF UP SO THAT ITS ROTOR SPINS IN THE SAME DIRECTION THAT THE APPLIED 
FORCE IS TRYING TO TURN IT. In other words, the direction of spin chases the applied force. When 
the direction of spin and the applied force are in the same direction, precession stops.
