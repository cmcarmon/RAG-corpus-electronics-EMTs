However, the NA for graded-index fibers varies as a function of the radial distance (r). NA varies
because of the refractive index grading in the fiber's core. The NA decreases from the maximum, NA(0),
to zero at distances greater than the core-cladding boundary distance (r>a). The NA, relative refractive
index difference ( D ), profile parameter ( a ), and normalized frequency (V) determine the number of
propagating modes in multimode graded-index fibers. A multimode graded-index fiber with the same
normalized frequency as a multimode step-index fiber will have approximately one-half as many
propagating modes. However, multimode graded-index fibers typically have over one-hundred
propagating modes.
