Impulse J produced from time t1 to t2 is defined to be

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \,\mathrm {d} t}

where F is the resultant force applied from t1 to t2.
From Newton's second law, force is related to momentum p by





F

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {p} }{\mathrm {d} t}}}

Therefore,

where Δp is the change in linear momentum from time t1 to t2. This is often called the impulse-momentum theorem.
As a result, an impulse may also be regarded as the change in momentum of an object to which a resultant force is applied. The impulse may be expressed in a simpler form when the mass is constant:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} =\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\mathbf {F} \,dt=\Delta \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v_{2}} -m\mathbf {v_{1}} }

where
F is the resultant force applied,
t1 and t2 are times when the impulse begins and ends, respectively,
m is the mass of the object,
v2 is the final velocity of the object at the end of the time interval, and
v1 is the initial velocity of the object when the time interval begins.
Impulse has the same units and dimensions (M L T−1) as momentum. In the International System of Units, these are kg⋅m/s = N⋅s. In English engineering units, they are slug⋅ft/s = lbf⋅s.

The term "impulse" is also used to refer to a fast-acting force or impact. This type of impulse is often idealized so that the change in momentum produced by the force happens with no change in time. This sort of change is a step change, and is not physically possible. However, this is a useful model for computing the effects of ideal collisions (such as in game physics engines).
