Assume you want to find the impedance of a series combination of 8 ohms resistance and 5 ohms 
inductive reactance. Start by drawing a horizontal line, R, representing 8 ohms resistance, as the base of 
the triangle. Then, since the effect of the reactance is always at right angles, or 90 degrees, to that of the 
resistance, draw the line XL, representing 5 ohms inductive reactance, as the altitude of the triangle. This 
is shown in figure 4-5. Now, complete the hypotenuse (longest side) of the triangle. Then, the hypotenuse 
represents the impedance of the circuit.
