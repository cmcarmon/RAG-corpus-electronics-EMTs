Digital computers perform arithmetic and logic functions on separate discrete data, like numbers, or 
combinations of discrete data, such as name, rate, and division. This makes them different from analog 
computers that operate on continuous data, like measuring temperature changes. We generally use digital 
computers for business and scientific data processing. The following are examples:
