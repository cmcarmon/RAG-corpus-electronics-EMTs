with a space between them. The two movable coils are also positioned coaxially and are connected in
series. The two pairs of coils (fixed pair and movable pair) are also connected in series with each other.
The movable coil is pivot-mounted between the fixed coils. The main shaft on which the movable coils
are mounted is restrained by spiral springs that restore the pointer to zero when no current is flowing
through the coil. These springs also act as conductors for delivering current to the movable coils. Since
these conducting springs are very small, the meter cannot carry a high value of current.
