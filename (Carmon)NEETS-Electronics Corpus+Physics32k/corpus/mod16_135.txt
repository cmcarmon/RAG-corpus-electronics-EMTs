â€¢ Keep clothing, hands, and feet dry if at all possible. When you must work in wet or damp
locations, place a rubber mat or other nonconductive material on top of a dry, wooden platform or
stool; then use the platform or stool to sit and stand on. Use insulated tools and insulated
flashlights of the molded type when you are required to work on exposed parts.
