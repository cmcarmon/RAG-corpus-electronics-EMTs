Figure 41-2 shows octal numbers with their deci-
mal and binary equivalents. The advantage is that octal 
numbers are converted directly from 3 bits of binary 
numbers. The octal number system is referred to 
as base 8. There are only eight digits (0–7) and then 
it recycles like the decimal system (0–9).
