is  less  than 
customary to assume that the capacitor is fully discharged (or charged)
after  ﬁve  time  constants.  In  other  words,  it  takes 
for  the  circuit  to
reach  its  ﬁnal  state  or  steady  state  when  no  changes  take  place  with
time.  Notice  that  for  every  time  interval  of 
the  voltage  is  reduced
v(t ⫹ t) ⫽ v(t)兾e ⫽ 0.368v(t),
by 36.8  percent  of  its  previous  value, 
regardless of the value of t.
