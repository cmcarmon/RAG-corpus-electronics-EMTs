where dfS is the small change in surface potential that corresponds to our incremental change in gate charge,
qNinv  is  the  inversion-layer  charge/unit  area,  and  QD  is  the  depletion-layer  charge/unit  area.  According  to
Eq. (24.32), the two types of response are equal at threshold, so one is larger than the other on either side of
this condition. To be more quantitative, the rate of increase in qNinv is exponential; that is, its rate of change
is proportional to qNinv, so as qNinv increases, so does the left side of Eq. (24.32). On the other hand, QD has a
square-root dependence on fS, which means its rate of change becomes smaller as QD increases. Thus, as surface
potential is increased, the left side of Eq. (24.32) increases proportional to qNinv until, at threshold, Eq. (24.32)
is satisÔ¨Åed. Then, beyond threshold, the exponential increase in qNinv with fS swamps QD, making change in
qNinv the dominant response. Likewise, below threshold, the exponential decrease in qNinv with decreasing fS
makes qNinv negligible and change in QD becomes the dominant response. The abruptness of this change in
behavior is the reason for the term threshold to describe MOSFET switching.
