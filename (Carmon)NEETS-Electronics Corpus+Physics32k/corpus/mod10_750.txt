The V is formed at such an angle that the main lobes reinforce along the line bisecting the V and 
make a very effective directional antenna (see figure 4-35). Connecting the two-wire feed line to the apex 
of the V and exciting the two sides of the V 180 degrees out of phase cause the lobes to add along the line 
of the bisector and to cancel in other directions, as shown in figure 4-36. The lobes are designated 1, 2, 3, 
and 4 on leg AA', and 5, 6, 7, and 8 on leg BB'. When the proper angle between AA' and BB' is chosen, 
lobes 1 and 4 have the same direction and combine with lobes 7 and 6, respectively. This combination of 
two major lobes from each leg results in the formation of two stronger lobes, which lie along an 
imaginary line bisecting the enclosed angle. Lobes 2, 3, 5, and 8 tend to cancel each other, as do the 
smaller lobes, which are approximately at right angles to the wire legs of the V. The resultant waveform 
pattern is shown at the right of the V antenna in figure 4-36.
