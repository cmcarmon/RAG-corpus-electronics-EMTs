The lap winding is illustrated in figure 1-14, view A This type of winding is used in dc generators 
designed for high-current applications. The windings are connected to provide several parallel paths for 
current in the armature. For this reason, lap-wound armatures used in dc generators require several pairs 
of poles and brushes.
