DC Motor Analysis
The separately excited dc motor is the simplest of all dc motors
and is the one most commonly found in industrial applications.
The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 66.11. An adjustable dc
voltage  V  is  applied  to  the  motor  terminals.  This  voltage  is
impressed across the series combination of the armature resis-
tance Ra and the back emf Va generated by the armature. The
Ô¨Åeld  is  energized  with  a  separate  dc  power  supply,  usually  at
300 or 500 V dc.
