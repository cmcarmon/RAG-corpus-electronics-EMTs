(d) In another case, the input sequence is zero for n < 0, then becomes nonzero. Sammy measures the
output to be y (n) = δ (n) + δ (n − 1). Can his measurement be correct? In other words, is there an
input that can yield this output? If so, ﬁnd the input x (n) that gives rise to this output. If not, why
not?
