Comparing the two v-i relations, we ﬁnd that they have the same form. In this case the Thévenin equiva-
lent resistance is Req = (R1 (cid:107) R2) and the Thévenin equivalent source has voltage veq =
vin.
Thus, from viewpoint of the terminals, you cannot distinguish the two circuits. Because the equivalent
circuit has fewer elements, it is easier to analyze and understand than any other alternative.
