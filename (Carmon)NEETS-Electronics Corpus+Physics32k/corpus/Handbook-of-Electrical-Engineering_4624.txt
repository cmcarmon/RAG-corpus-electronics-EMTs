Fiber Optic
An acoustic ﬁeld acting on an optical ﬁber will change the optical path length by changing the length and index
of  refraction  of  the  ﬁber.  Extremely  sensitive  hydrophones  and  microphones  can  be  made  by  using  a  ﬁber
exposed to an acoustic ﬁeld as one leg of an optical interferometer. Path length changes of the order of 10
–6
optical wavelengths can be detected. The principal advantages of such sensors are their conﬁgurational ﬂexibility,
