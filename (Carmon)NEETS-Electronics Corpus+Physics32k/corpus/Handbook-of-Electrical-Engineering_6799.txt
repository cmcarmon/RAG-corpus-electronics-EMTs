The SCP in the intelligent network can support a vast number of services ranging from Calling Name Delivery
service to messaging service. With Calling Name Delivery, a switch sends a query to the SCP with the ten-digit
calling party number; the response is the calling party name which is then forwarded by the switch to a display
unit attached to the called party station set. In support of messaging services, the address translation capability
of the SCP can be used to translate a person’s telephone number to an electronic-mail address. As a result, the
sender of electronic mail need only know a person’s telephone number.
