Representation of Signed Integers
The  two  most  common  representations  of  signed  integers  are  sign  and  magnitude  (SM)  representation  and
true and complement (TC) representation. While SM representation might be easier to understand and convert
to and from, it has its own problems. Therefore, we will Ô¨Ånd TC representation to be more commonly used.
