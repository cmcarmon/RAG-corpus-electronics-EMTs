All receivers generate a certain amount of noise, which you must take into account when measuring
sensitivity. Receiver noise may originate from the atmosphere (lightning) or from internal components
(transistors, tubes). Noise is the limiting factor of sensitivity. You will find sensitivity is the value of input
carrier voltage (in microvolts) that must be applied from the signal generator to the receiver input to
develop a specified output power.
