State Estimation
In  general,  modern  design  procedures  require  that  the  state  vector  x(t)  be  fed  back,  as  in  (100.71).  The
measurement of all state variables is difﬁcult to implement for high-order systems. The usual procedure is to
estimate the states of the system from the measurement of the output y(t), with the estimated states then fed
back.
