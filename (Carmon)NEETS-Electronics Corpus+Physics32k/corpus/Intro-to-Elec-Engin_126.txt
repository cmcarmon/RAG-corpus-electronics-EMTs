Mechanical and civil engineers routinely employ the dependence of resistance on the physical
dimensions of a conductor to measure strain. A strain gauge is a device that is bonded to the
surface of an object, and whose resistance varies as a function of the surface strain experienced
by the object. Strain gauges can be used to measure strain, stress, force, torque, and pressure.
