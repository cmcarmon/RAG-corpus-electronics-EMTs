As current enters the positive terminal of the capacitor, it transports the
electric charge q onto the corresponding plate; the unit of charge is the Coulomb
[C]. Simultaneously, an identical current exits the negative terminal and trans-
ports an equal charge off the other plate. Thus, although charge is separated
within the capacitor, no net charge accumulates within it, as is required for
lumped circuit elements by the lumped matter discipline discussed in Chapter 1.
The charge q on the positive plate and its image charge −q on the negative
plate produce an electric field within the dielectric. It follows from Maxwell’s
Equations and the properties of linear dielectrics that the strength E of this
field is
