Fixed resistors often come in a cylindrical package with two leads sticking 
out (refer to Figure 5­1) so you can connect them to other circuit elements. 
(see the “Identifying resistors on circuit boards” sidebar for exceptions.) Feel 
free to insert fixed resistors either way in your circuits — there’s no left or 
right, up or down, or to or from when it comes to these little two‐terminal 
devices.
