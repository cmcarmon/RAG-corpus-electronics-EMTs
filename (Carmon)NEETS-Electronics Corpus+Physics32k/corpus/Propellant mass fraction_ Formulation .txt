The propellant mass fraction is given by:




ζ
=



m

p



m

0






{\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {m_{p}}{m_{0}}}}

And because,





m

0


=

m

f


+

m

p




{\displaystyle m_{0}=m_{f}+m_{p}}

it follows that:




ζ
=




m

−

m

=

{\displaystyle \zeta ={\frac {m_{0}-m_{f}}{m_{0}}}={\frac {m_{p}}{m_{p}+m_{f}}}=1-{\frac {m_{f}}{m_{0}}}}

Where:




ζ


{\displaystyle \zeta }
is the propellant mass fraction





m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
is the propellant mass





m

0




{\displaystyle m_{0}}
is the initial mass of the vehicle





m

f




{\displaystyle m_{f}}
is the final mass of the vehicle
