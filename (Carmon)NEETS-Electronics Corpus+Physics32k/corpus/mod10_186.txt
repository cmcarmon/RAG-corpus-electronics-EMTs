The magnetic fields that are set up around two parallel rods, as shown in figure 1-28 view A, are in
maximum opposition. Rod 1 contains a current flowing from the generator, while rod 2 contains a current
flowing toward the generator. As a result, the direction of the magnetic field surrounding rod 1 is opposite
the direction of the magnetic field surrounding rod 2. This will cause cancellation of part or all of both
magnetic fields with a resultant decrease in radiation of the electromagnetic energy. View B illustrates the
fact that if the far ends of rods 1 and 2 are separated from each other while the rods are still connected to
the generator at the near ends, more space, and consequently less opposition, will occur between the
magnetic fields of the two rods. View C illustrates the fact that placing the rods in line makes the currents
through both rods flow in the same direction. Therefore, the two magnetic fields are in the same direction;
thus, maximum electromagnetic radiation into space can be obtained.
