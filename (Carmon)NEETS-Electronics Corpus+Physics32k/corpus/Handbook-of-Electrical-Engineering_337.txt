This result can be recast if the sources are separated from the other branches and one of the references of
each source (current reference for each v-source and voltage reference for each i-source) is reversed. Then the
vi product for each source, with new references, will enter Eq. (3.3) with a negative sign and will represent the
power supplied by this source. When these terms are transposed to the right side of the equation, their signs
are changed. The new equation will state in mathematical form that
