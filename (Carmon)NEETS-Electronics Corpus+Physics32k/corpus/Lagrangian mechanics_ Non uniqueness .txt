The Lagrangian of a given system is not unique. A Lagrangian L can be multiplied by a nonzero constant a, an arbitrary constant b can be added, and the new Lagrangian aL + b will describe exactly the same motion as L. A less obvious result is that two Lagrangians describing the same system can differ by the total derivative (not partial) of some function f(q, t) with respect to time;

{\displaystyle L'=L+{\frac {\mathrm {d} f(\mathbf {q} ,t)}{\mathrm {d} t}}\,.}

Each Lagrangian will obtain exactly the same equations of motion.
