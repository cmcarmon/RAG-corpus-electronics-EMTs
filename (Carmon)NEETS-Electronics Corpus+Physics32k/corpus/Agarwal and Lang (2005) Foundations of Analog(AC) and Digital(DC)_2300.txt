We fix the problem created by the finite propagation speeds of electro-
magnetic waves by adding a third constraint. We include the constraint that
the timescale of interest in our problem be much larger than electromagnetic
propagation delays through our elements. Put another way, the size of our
lumped elements must be much smaller than the wavelength associated with
the V and I signals.5
