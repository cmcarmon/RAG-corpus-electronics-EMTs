FIGURE 36.2 Hall effect. A magnetic ﬁeld B applied to a block of semiconducting material through which a current I is
ﬂowing exerts a force F = V · B on the current carriers (electrons or holes) and produces an electric charge on the right
face of the block. The charge is positive if the carriers are holes and negative if the carriers are electrons.
