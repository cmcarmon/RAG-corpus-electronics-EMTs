In power supply applications it is common to use a transformer to isolate the power
supply from the 110 V AC line. A rectiÔ¨Åer can be connected to the transformer secondary
to generate a DC voltage with little AC ripple. The object of any power supply is to reduce
the ripple which is the periodic variation in voltage about the steady value.
