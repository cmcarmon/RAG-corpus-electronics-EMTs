Since iC is typically 100 times larger than iB we can make the approximation iE ≈ iC.
An ideal transistor is deﬁned such that hie = 0 and hence vB = vE. When the eﬀects of hie
cannot be ignored, we can use the perfect transistor model as described by the two equations
above. On a circuit diagram hie can be added directly to the ideal transistor symbol.
