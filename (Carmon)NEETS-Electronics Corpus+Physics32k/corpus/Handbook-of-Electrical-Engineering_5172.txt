Piezoelectric-Based Sensors
The most conventional form of sensing technology is that of piezoelectric materials, which generate an electrical
response to a stimulus. In recent times piezoelectric materials have been greatly improved in mechanical strength
and sensitivity. Pressure and vibration can be directly sensed as a one-to-one transduction effect resulting from
the elastic-to-piezoelectric effect. Bending, on the other hand, can be sensed via piezoabsorption characteristics.
