Threshold braking and Cadence braking are two manual techniques used to extract maximum deceleration from a vehicle. Threshold braking maintains a steady braking force with slight (10-20%) slip, around or just below the point of maximum tire grip force. Cadence braking accepts that holding the threshold braking limit is exceptionally hard, and relies on manual manipulation of braking force to rapidly go just above and below the skid point, essentially oscillating between unlocked rolling and locked skidding around the point at which threshold braking would be done. This technique is less effective than threshold braking but much easier to learn.
