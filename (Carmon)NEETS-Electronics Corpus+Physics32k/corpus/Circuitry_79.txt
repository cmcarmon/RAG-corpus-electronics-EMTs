Resistor markings 
 
Carbon  and  metal  oxide  resistors  are  normally 
marked  with  colour  codes  which  indicate  their 
value and tolerance. Two methods of colour coding 
are  in  common  use;  one  involves  four  coloured 
bands (see Fig. 2.4) while the other uses five colour 
bands (see Fig. 2.5).
