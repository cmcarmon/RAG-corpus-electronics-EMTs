In addition to the kinematic analysis of a quick return mechanism, there is a dynamic analysis present. At certain lengths and attachments, the arm of the mechanism can be evaluated and then adjusted to certain preferences. For example, the differences in the forces acting upon the system at an instant can be represented by D'Alembert's principle. Depending on the structural design of the quick return mechanism, the law of cosines can be used to determine the angles and displacements of the arm. The ratio between the working stroke (engine) and the return stroke can be simplified through the manipulation of these concepts.
Despite similarities between quick return mechanisms, there are many different possibilities for the outline of all forces, speeds, lengths, motions, functions, and vectors in a mechanism.
