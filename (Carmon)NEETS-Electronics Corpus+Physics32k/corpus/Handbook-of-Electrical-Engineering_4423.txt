The ﬁnal step in cabling is the sheathing operation. After the ﬁbers have been made into identiﬁable units,
one or more of the units (as discussed earlier) form a core which is then covered with a combination of sheathing
layers. The number and combination of the sheathing layers depend on the intended use. Typically, a polyeth-
ylene sheath is extruded over the ﬁlled cable core. In a typical cross-ply design, metallic or nonmetallic strength
members are applied over the ﬁrst sheath layer, followed by another polyethylene sheath, over which another
layer of strength members is applied. The direction of lay of the two layers of the strength members is opposite
to each other. A ﬁnal sheath is applied and the cable is ready for the ﬁnal inspection, preconnectorization, and
shipment.  Metallic  vapor  barriers  and  lightning-  and  rodent-protection  sheath  options  are  also  available.
Further armoring is applied to cables made for submarine application.
