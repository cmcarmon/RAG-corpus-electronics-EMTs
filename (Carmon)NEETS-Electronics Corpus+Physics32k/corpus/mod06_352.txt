Examine figure 2-16. Here you see a cold-cathode tube connected to a variable voltage source. The
variable resistor rkp does not exist as a physical component, but is used to represent the resistance
between the cathode and the plate. Most cold-cathode tubes have a firing point (ionizing voltage) at about
115 volts. Thus, the tube in view A of the figure is below the firing point. Because the tube lacks
thermionic emission capabilities, no current will flow and the tube will have a resistance (rkp) near
infinity. The potential difference between the plate and ground under these conditions will be equal to the
source (Ebb) voltage, as shown on the voltmeter.
