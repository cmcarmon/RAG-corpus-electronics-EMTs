For longer devices the current-voltage curves saturate for a different reason. Consider the potential along
the insulator-channel interface, the surface potential. Whatever the surface potential is at the source end of the
channel, it varies from the source end to a value larger at the drain end by VD because the drain potential is
VD higher than the source. The gate, on the other hand, is at the same potential everywhere. Thus, the difference
in potential between the gate and the source is larger than that between the gate and the drain. Correspondingly,
the oxide ﬁeld at the source is larger than that at the drain, and as a result less charge can be supported at the
drain. This reduction in attractive power of the gate reduces the number of carriers in the channel at the drain
end, increasing channel resistance. In short, we have ID »VD /Rch, but the channel resistance Rch = Rch (VD) is
increasing with VD. As a result, the current-voltage curves do not continue along the initial straight line, but
bend over and saturate.
