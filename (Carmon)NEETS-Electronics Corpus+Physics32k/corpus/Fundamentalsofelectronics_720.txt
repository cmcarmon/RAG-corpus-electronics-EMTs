Problem 5.32: Echoes
Echoes not only occur in canyons, but also in auditoriums and telephone circuits. In one situation where
the echoed signal has been sampled, the input signal x (n) emerges as x (n) + a1x (n − n1) + a2x (n − n2).
(a) Find the diﬀerence equation of the system that models the production of echoes.
(b) To simulate this echo system, ELEC 241 students are asked to write the most eﬃcient (quickest)
program that has the same input-output relationship. Suppose the duration of x (n) is 1,000 and that
5, and n2 = 25. Half the class votes to just program the diﬀerence equation
a1 = 1
while the other half votes to program a frequency domain approach that exploits the speed of the FFT.
Because of the undecided vote, you must break the tie. Which approach is more eﬃcient and why?
