The most dangerous part of a hydraulic torque wrench is the reaction member, often called reaction arm. When torque is applied to the bolt or nut, the reaction member abuts against a stationary object to stop the wrench from turning around the fastener. This reaction force is tremendous and accidents (for example pinched fingers) have happened more than once.
Since 2014 it is possible to torque tighten bolts without the use of a reaction arm, and thus without pinch point. This is a great break-through in the industry. Reaction arm free torqueing is possible due to the usage of a reaction washer. The knurled side of the washer hold on to the construction/flange and the bolt or nut turn over a smooth and through-hardened surface. The reaction washer will become a stationary object underneath the nut, eliminating the use of reaction arms.
