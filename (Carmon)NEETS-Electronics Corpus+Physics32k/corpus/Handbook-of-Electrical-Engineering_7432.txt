There  is  another  important  reason  for  the  current  popularity  of  computer-aided  analysis  and  simulation
techniques. It is now practical to make extensive use of these techniques. The computing power of many personal
computers  and  workstations  available  today  exceeds  the  capabilities  of  many  large  mainframe  computers  of
only a decade ago. The low cost of these computing resources make them widely available. As a result, signiﬁcant
computing resources are available to the communications engineer within the ofﬁce or even the home environment.
