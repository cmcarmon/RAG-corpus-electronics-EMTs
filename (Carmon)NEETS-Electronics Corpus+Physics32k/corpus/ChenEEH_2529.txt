This is a special class of microwave passive components that
converts the fundamental guided mode from balanced to un-
balanced or vice versa. This is why it is called balun (balance-
to-unbalance). In this case, the characteristic impedance may
also be transformed in this line-to-line modal conversion.
Usually, a balun structure deals with two different types of
transmission line geometry that are used as input and output
of the circuit.
