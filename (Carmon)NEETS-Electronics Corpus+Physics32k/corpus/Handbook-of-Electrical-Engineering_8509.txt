In  the  mid-1920s,  MIT  electrical  engineer Vannevar  Bush  devised  the “product  integraph”,  a  semi-
automatic machine for solving problems in determining the characteristics of complex electrical systems.
This  was  followed  a  few  years  later  by  the  “differential  analyzer”,  the  ﬁrst  general  equation-solving
machine. These machines were mechanical, analog devices, but at the same time that they were being
built and copied, the principles of electrical, digital machines were being laid out.
