In most situations, the user does not want to just capture an arbitrary time that an event occurs, but wants to measure a time interval, the time between a start event and a stop event.
That can be done by measuring an arbitrary time both the start and stop events and subtracting. The measurement can be off by two counts.
The subtraction can be avoided if the counter is held at zero until the start event, counts during the interval, and then stops counting after the stop event.
Coarse counters base on a reference clock with signals generated at a stable frequency




f

0




{\displaystyle f_{0}}
. When the start signal is detected the counter starts counting clock signals and terminates counting after the stop signal is detected. The time interval



T


{\displaystyle T}
between start and stop is then
