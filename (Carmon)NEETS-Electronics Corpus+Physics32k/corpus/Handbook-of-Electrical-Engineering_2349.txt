For general purposes, even with these assumptions and limitations, the models based on the classical approach
give fairly accurate results. The model assumes that the driving force for the carriers is the quasi-Fermi potential
gradient, which is also dependent upon the electric Ô¨Åeld value. Therefore, in some simulators, the quasi-Fermi
level distributions are computed and the carrier distribution is estimated from this information.
