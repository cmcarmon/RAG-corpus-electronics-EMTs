11.1.4 A sample of iron having a volume of 20 cm3
is subjected to a magnetizing force varying sinu-
soidally at a frequency of 400 Hz. The area of the
hysteresis loop is found to be 80 cm2 with the ï¬‚ux
density plotted in Wb/m2 and the magnetizing
force in At/m. The scale factors used are 1 cm =
0.03 T and 1 cm = 200 At/m. Find the hysteresis
loss in watts.
