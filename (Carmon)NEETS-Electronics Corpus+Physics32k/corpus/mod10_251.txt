The position of the antenna in space is important because it affects the polarization of the 
electromagnetic wave. When the transmitting antenna is close to the ground, vertically polarized waves 
cause a greater signal strength along the Earth's surface. On the other hand, antennas high above the 
ground should be horizontally polarized to get the greatest possible signal strength to the Earth's surface. 
Vertically and horizontally polarized antennas will be discussed in more detail in chapter 4.
