In a digital inverter, a lower ro widens the voltage swing needed to cause a transition in output voltage. This
widening  increases  power  loss  due  to  current  spiking  during  the  transition,  and  reduces  noise  margins
[Annaratone, 1986]. It is not, however, a Ô¨Årst-order concern in device miniaturization for digital applications.
Because small-signal circuits are more sensitive to ro than digital circuits, MOSFETs designed for small-signal
applications cannot be made as small as those for digital applications.
