The important specifications for a battery are its nominal voltage, its total
store of energy, and its internal resistance. In this section, we will assume
that the internal resistance of a battery is zero. The voltage measured at the
terminals of a single cell
is fundamentally related to the chemical reaction
releasing the energy. In a flashlight battery, for example, the carbon central
rod is approximately 1.5 V positive with respect to the zinc case, as noted
in Figure 1.9a. In a circuit diagram, such a single-cell battery is usually rep-
resented schematically by the symbol shown in Figure 1.9b. Of course, to
obtain a larger voltage, several cells can be connected in series: the positive
terminal of the first cell connected to the negative terminal of the second cell,
and so forth, as suggested pictorially in Figure 1.10. Multiple-cell batteries are
usually represented by the symbol in Figure 1.10b, (with no particular cor-
respondence between the number of lines and the actual number of cells in
series).
