The two aircraft collided at approximately 18:13 over eastern Senegal. It is believed that the air ambulance suffered a decompression event as a result of the collision, disabling everyone on board, continuing on autopilot past Dakar, until it is presumed to have run out of fuel and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 110 kilometers (68 miles) off the coast of Dakar. The 737 received little damage in the collision, a small part of the left winglet was sheared off. As the aircraft was nearing Cotonou, the captain announced that they had to continue on to Malabo due to 'technical and security reasons'.
