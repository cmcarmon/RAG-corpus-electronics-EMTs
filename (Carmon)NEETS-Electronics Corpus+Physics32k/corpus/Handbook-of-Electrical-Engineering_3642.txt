Time-Varying Magnetic Fields
In 1831, 11 years after Oersted demonstrated that a current produced a magnetic ﬁeld which could deﬂect a
compass  needle,  Faraday  succeeded  in  showing  the  converse  effect—that  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  could  produce  a
current.  The  reason  for  the  delay  between  the  two  discoveries  was  that  it  is  only  when  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  is
changing that an emf is produced.
