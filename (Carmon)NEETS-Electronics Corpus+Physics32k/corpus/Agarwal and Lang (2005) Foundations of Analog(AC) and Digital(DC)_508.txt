To find v in terms of i, we need to apply some form of excitation, and
measure the response. The derivation is simplest if we use either a voltage
source or a current source, rather than a complicated excitation network. In
Figure 3.55b, we have chosen to apply a test current source to the terminals. To
calculate the response vt by superposition, first set all the internal independent
sources to zero, as in Figure 3.55c, and calculate the voltage va. As discussed
in Section 3.5.1, dependent sources are left as is. Then set itest to zero, as in
Figure 3.55d, and calculate vb. The desired value of vt is the sum va + vb. From
Figure 3.55c,
