Flow calorimeters provide the primary standards for the measurement of high power levels; and, in 
conjunction with calibrated directional couplers, attenuators, power dividers, or other similar devices 
serve to standardize medium- and low-power measuring instruments. The measurement time depends on 
the required time for the entering fluid to reach the outlet, where the rise in temperature is measured. The 
circulating fluid may serve in a dual capacity as the dissipative medium and coolant, using the direct 
heating method, or solely as a coolant, using the indirect heating method. Because of its excellent thermal 
properties and high dielectric losses at 1 GHz or higher, water is normally used in both heating methods. 
Water is rarely used as the fluid at frequencies lower than 100 MHz, because of insufficient dielectric 
losses. The indirect heating method offers a wider frequency and power-range coverage and can be used 
in substitution-type measurements.
