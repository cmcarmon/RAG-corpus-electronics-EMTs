In the Federal Republic of Germany, the Ladenschlussgesetz or "Shop Closing Law" (abbreviated: LadSchlG) is the federal law regulating at which times retail stores were forced to be closed to the public. The Ladenschlussgesetz in its current form was first enacted on 28 November 1956 following pressure from Germany's trade unions; in its last revision (of 2 June 2003), points of sale (Verkaufsstellen) must be closed at any of the following times:
On Sundays and public holidays;
On working days (Monday through Saturday) before 06:00 and after 20:00;
On December 24 before 06:00 and after 14:00 if that date falls on a working day
The law provides differing regulations for pharmacies, petrol stations, shops at train stations and airports, etc.
On 30 June 2006, as part of the FÃ¶deralismusreform ("Federalism Reform"), the regulatory responsibility for this area was devolved to the German states. The net effect, although the Federal law technically remains in force, the states are free to determine the opening hours of retail stores in their areas. Meanwhile, all states - with the exception of the more conservative Bavaria - made use of that option.
