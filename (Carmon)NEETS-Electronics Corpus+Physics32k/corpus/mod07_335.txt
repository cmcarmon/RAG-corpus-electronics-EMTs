When it is necessary to block the voltage between one electronic circuit and another, and transfer the 
signal at the same time, an amplifier coupling capacitor is often used as shown in figure 3-36. Although 
this method of coupling does block dc between the circuits, voltage isolation is not complete. A newer 
method, making use of optoelectronic devices to achieve electrical isolation, is the optical coupler, shown 
in figure 3-37. The coupler is composed of an LED and a photodiode contained in a light-conducting 
medium. As the polarity signs in figure 3-37 show, the LED is forward biased, while the photodiode is 
reverse biased. When the input signal causes current through the LED to increase, the light produce by the 
LED increases. This increased light intensity causes current flow through the photodiode to increase. In 
this way, changes in input current produce proportional changes in the output, even though the two 
circuits are electrically isolated.
