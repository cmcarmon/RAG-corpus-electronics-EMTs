Figure 13-5 shows a small solderless breadboard with a battery‐powered 
circuit connected. The breadboard in the figure has sections of rows and 
columns connected in a certain way underneath the board. I discuss just how 
the various contact holes are connected in Chapter 15, where I also discuss 
how to build circuits using breadboards. For now, just know that different 
sizes of breadboards with different numbers of contact holes are available.
