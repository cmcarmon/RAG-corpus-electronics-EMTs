except that the current gain is not based on the emitter-to-collector current ratio, alpha (α). Instead, it is 
based on the emitter-to-base current ratio called GAMMA (γ), because the output is taken off the emitter. 
Since a small change in base current controls a large change in emitter current, it is still possible to obtain
