The required chaotic basis functions can be generated by different chaotic circuits (as shown in Fig. 5.26)
or they can be produced by a single chaotic generator whose output is multiplied by two different constants.
In both cases, the binary information to be transmitted is mapped to the bit energies of chaotic sample functions.
In  chaotic  digital  communications  systems,  as  in  conventional  communications  schemes,  the  transmitted
