Figure 39-16 shows a basic free-running multivibra-
tor circuit. It is basically an oscillator consisting of two 
stages coupled so that the input signal to each stage is 
taken from the output of the other. One stage conducts 
while the other stage is cut off, until a point is reached 
where the stages reverse their conditions. The cir-
cuit is free-running because of regenerative feedback.
