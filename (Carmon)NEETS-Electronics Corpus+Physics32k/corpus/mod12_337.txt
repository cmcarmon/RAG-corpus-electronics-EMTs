The carrier frequency is not the only frequency we must concern ourselves with in pulse systems.
We must also be concerned with the frequency that is associated with the repetition rate of groups of
pulses. Figure 2-33 shows that a specific time period exists between each group of rf pulses. This time is
the same for each repetition of the pulse and is called the PULSE-REPETITION TIME (prt). To find out
how often these groups of pulses occur, compute PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY (prf) using the
formula:
