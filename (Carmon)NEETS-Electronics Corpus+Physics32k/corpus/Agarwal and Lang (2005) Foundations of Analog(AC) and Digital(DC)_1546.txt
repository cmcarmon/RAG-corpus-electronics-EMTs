j) An approximate value for the buffer delay can be obtained by doubling the individual
inverter delay. Estimate the buffer delay by using the inverter delay computed in
Problem 10.1b. What is the percentage error in the value of this estimated delay as
compared to the accurate buffer delay computed in part (i) of this problem?
