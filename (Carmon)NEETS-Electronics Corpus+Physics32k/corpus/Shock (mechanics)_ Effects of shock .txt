Mechanical shock has the potential for damaging an item (e.g., an entire light bulb) or an element of the item (e.g. a filament in an Incandescent light bulb):
A brittle or fragile item can fracture. For example, two crystal wine glasses may shatter when impacted against each other. A shear pin in an engine is designed to fracture with a specific magnitude of shock. Note that a soft ductile material may sometimes exhibit brittle failure during shock due to time-temperature superposition.
A ductile item can be bent by a shock. For example, a copper pitcher may bend when dropped on the floor.
Some items may appear to be not damaged by a single shock but will experience fatigue failure with numerous repeated low-level shocks.
A shock may result in only minor damage which may not be critical for use. However, cumulative minor damage from several shocks will eventually result in the item being unusable.
A shock may not produce immediate apparent damage but might cause the service life of the product to be shortened: the reliability is reduced.
A shock may cause an item to become out of adjustment. For example, when a precision scientific instrument is subjected to a moderate shock, good metrology practice may be to have it recalibrated before further use.
Some materials such as primary high explosives may detonate with mechanical shock or impact.
When glass bottles of liquid are dropped or subjected to shock, the water hammer effect may cause hydrodynamic glass breakage.
