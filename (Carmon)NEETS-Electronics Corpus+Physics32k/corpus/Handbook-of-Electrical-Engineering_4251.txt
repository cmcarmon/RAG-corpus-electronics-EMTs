The  detection  curves  presented  here  and  in  most  other  references  presuppose  noise-limited  operation.  In
many cases, the composite interference present at the radar system output will be dominated by clutter returns
or  electromagnetic  interference  such  as  that  imposed  by  hostile  electronic  countermeasures.  The  standard
textbook detection curves cannot be applied in these situations unless the composite interference is statistically
similar to thermal noise with a Gaussian PDF and a white power spectral density. The presence of non-Gaussian
interference  is  generally  characterized  by  an  elevated  false  alarm  probability.  Adaptive  detection  threshold
estimation  techniques  are  often  required  to  search  for  targets  in  environments  characterized  by  such
interference.
