Radio frequency energy in radar is transmitted in short pulses with time durations that may vary
from 1 to 50 microseconds or more. If the transmitter is cut off before any reflected energy returns from a
target, the receiver can distinguish between the transmitted pulse and the reflected pulse. After all
reflections have returned, the transmitter can again be cut on and the process repeated. The receiver
output is applied to an indicator which measures the time interval between the transmission of energy and
its return as a reflection. Since the energy travels at a constant velocity, the time interval becomes a
measure of the distance traveled (RANGE). Since this method does not depend on the relative frequency
of the returned signal, or on the motion of the target, difficulties experienced in cw or fm methods are not
encountered. The pulse modulation method is used in many military radar applications.
