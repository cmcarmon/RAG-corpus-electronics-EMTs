This  process  of  continually  looking  up  material  you  thought  you
had  acquired  in  earlier  courses  may  seem  very  tedious  at  Ô¨Årst;  how-
ever, as your skills develop and your knowledge increases, this process
will become easier and easier. On a personal note, it is this very process
that  led  me  from  being  a  much  less  than  average  student  to  someone
who could earn a Ph.D. and become a successful researcher.
