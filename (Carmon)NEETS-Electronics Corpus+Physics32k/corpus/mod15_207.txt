These testers are used primarily for locating defective synchros. Although they do provide a method 
for zeroing synchros, they should not be relied on without question. It is possible for the calibrated dial to 
slip from its proper position, and since the dial is graduated only every 10ยบ, it is difficult to read small 
angles with accuracy. Therefore, the synchro tester method of zeroing synchros is potentially less accurate 
than those previously described. To zero a TX, CX or TR using a synchro tester, use the following 
procedure:
