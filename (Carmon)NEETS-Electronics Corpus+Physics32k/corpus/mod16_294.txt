AUDIO FREQUENCIES can be measured by a process known as ZERO BEATING. This is done
by matching an unknown signal with a locally generated signal of the same frequency obtained from a
calibrated high-precision oscillator. As the two frequencies are brought closer to the same value, they
reach a point of zero beat. This is when the frequency generated in the oscillator is equal to the frequency
of the unknown signal being measured. Another term for zero beating is HETERODYNING.
