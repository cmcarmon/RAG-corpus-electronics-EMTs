In view A of figure 3-11, a source of 150 volts is applied to a series circuit consisting of two 10-
kilohm resistors. View A shows the voltage drop across each resistor to be 75 volts. In the 150-volt range,
the voltmeter to be used has a total internal resistance of 10 kilohms. View B shows the voltmeter
connected across the circuit. The parallel combination of R2 and the meter now present a total resistance
of 5 kilohms. Because of the addition of the voltmeter, the voltage drops change to 100 volts across R1
and 50 volts across R2. Notice that this is not the normal voltage drop across R2. Actual circuit conditions
have been altered because of the voltmeter.
