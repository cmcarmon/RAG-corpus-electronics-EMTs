Frequencies contained within the human voice can be transmitted over telephone lines without 
difficulty, but transmitting them via radio circuits is not practical. This is because of their extremely long 
wavelengths and the fact that antennas would have to be constructed with long physical dimensions to 
transmit or radiate these wavelengths. Generally, antennas have radiating elements that are 1/4, 1/2, 1, or 
more full wavelengths of the frequency to be radiated. The wavelengths of voice frequencies employed on 
radiotelephone circuits range from 1,200,000 meters at 250 hertz to 109,090 meters at 2,750 hertz. Even a 
quarter-wave antenna would require a large area, be expensive to construct, and consume enormous 
amounts of power.
