The hardware can dynamically allocate parts of the cache memory for addresses deemed most likely to be

accessed soon. The cache contains only redundant copies of the address space. The cache memory is

  In  an  associative  memory,  the  address  of  a  memory  location  is  stored,  along  with  its
content. Rather than reading data directly from a memory location, the cache is given an address and responds
by providing data which may or may not be the data requested. When a cache miss occurs, the memory access
is then performed with respect to the backing storage, and the cache is updated to include the new data.
