Figure 3.14 summarizes the series and parallel combination results. These results are easy to remember
and very useful. Keep in mind that for series combinations, voltage and resistance are the key quantities,
while for parallel combinations current and conductance are more important. In series combinations, the
currents through each element are the same; in parallel ones, the voltages are the same.
