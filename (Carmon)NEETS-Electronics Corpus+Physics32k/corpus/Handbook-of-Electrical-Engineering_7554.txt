• Noise Margins. NMH = VOHmin – VIHmin is how much larger the guaranteed least positive output logical
1 level is than the least positive input level that will be interpreted as a logical 1. It represents how large
a negative-going glitch on an input 1 can be before it affects the output of the driven device. Similarly,
NML = VILmax – VOLmax is the amplitude of the largest positive- going glitch on an input 0 that will not
affect the output of the driven device.
