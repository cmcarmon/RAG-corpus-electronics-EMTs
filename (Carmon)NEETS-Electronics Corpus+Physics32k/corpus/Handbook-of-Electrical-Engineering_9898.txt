where k = 0, –1, –2, … . The graphical interpretation of the last two equations is shown in Fig. 100.22. For
the point s1 to be a point on the root locus, the angles of the phasors drawn from the poles and zeros of G(s)H(s)
to s1 must satisfy Eq. (100.43) or (100.44) depending on the sign of K. Applying the magnitude condition of
Eq. (100.39) to (100.42), the magnitude of K is expressed as
