The vertical input (or signal input) jack connects the signal to be examined to the vertical-deflection
amplifier. Some oscilloscopes may have two input jacks, one labeled AC and the other labeled DC. Other
models may have a single input jack with an associated switch, such as the AC GRD DC switch in figure
6-19. This switch is used to select the ac or dc connection. In the DC position, the signal is connected
directly to the vertical-deflection amplifier; in the AC position, the signal is first fed through a capacitor.
Figure 6-20 shows the schematic of one arrangement.
