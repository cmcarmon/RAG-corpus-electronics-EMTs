(1) Microwave circuits typically process band-pass signals
at frequencies above 3 GHz. Common circuit features
include microstrip transmission lines, directional
couplers, circulators, Ô¨Ålters, matching networks, and
individual transistors. Circuit operation is fundamen-
tally based on electromagnetic wave phenomena.
