The primary purpose of the robot control system is to issue commands to joint actuators to faithfully execute
. This may involve position control when the manipulator is following a
a planned trajectory in the 
trajectory  through  free  space  or  a  combination  of  position  and  force  control  if  the  manipulator  is  to  react
continuously to contact forces at the tool or end-effector.
