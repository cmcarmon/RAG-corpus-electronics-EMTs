The parallel LC circuit used as a frequency-determining network is called a TUNED CIRCUIT. This
circuit is "tuned" to give the proper response at the desired frequency by selecting the proper values of
inductance and capacitance. A circuit using this principle is shown in figure 2-14 which shows an rf
amplifier with parallel LC circuits used as frequency-determining networks. This rf amplifier will only be
effective in amplifying the frequency determined by the parallel LC circuits.
