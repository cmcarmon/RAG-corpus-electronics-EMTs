The use of brushes in the design of dc generators can cause a serious problem in practice. Each time a brush
comes into contact with two adjacent copper segments, the corresponding conductors are short-circuited. For
a  loaded  generator,  such  an  event  occurs  when  the  currents  in  these  conductors  are  not  zero,  resulting  in
ï¬‚ashover at the brushes. This means that the life span of the brushes can be drastically reduced and that frequent
maintenance is needed. A number of design techniques have been developed to mitigate this problem.
