By making the sensitive meter movement part of a voltage or current divider circuit, the
movementâ€™s useful measurement range may be extended to measure far greater levels than
what could be indicated by the movement alone. Precision resistors are used to create the
divider circuits necessary to divide voltage or current appropriately. One of the lessons you
will learn in this chapter is how to design these divider circuits.
