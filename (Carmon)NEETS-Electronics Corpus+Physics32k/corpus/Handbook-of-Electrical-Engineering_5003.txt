conductivity whose units are stated in S cm–1 or V–1 cm–1. Surface tracking may be prevented by cleaning the
surface and by applying silicone greases. When insulators are employed under a vacuum environment, charge
accumulation will occur in the surface because the charged surface will no longer be able to discharge due to
the ﬁnite breakdown strength of an ambient gas. Space charge will thus play a dominant role in the surface
breakdown mechanism [Miller, 1993].
