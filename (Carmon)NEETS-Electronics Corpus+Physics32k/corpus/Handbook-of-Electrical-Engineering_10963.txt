FIGURE  113.5 Response  of  myelinated  nerve  model  to  rectangular  monophasic  current  of  100  ms  duration,  20-mm
diameter ﬁber, point electrode 2 mm from central node. Solid lines show response at node nearest electrode for three levels
of current. IT denotes threshold current. Dashed lines show propagated response at next three adjacent nodes for a stimulus
at threshold. (Source: J. P. Reilly, V. T. Freeman, and W. D. Larkin, “Sensory effects of transient electrical stimulation—Eval-
