To simplify the relationship between the digits on the meter scale and the setting of the range switch,
always use the multiple of the full-scale-deflection digits on the meter face that correspond to the numbers
of the range switch. For example, use the 250 scale for the 250MV jack, 2.5V, and 250V ranges; the 50
on the scale for 50V and 500V ranges; and the 10 on the scale for the 10V and 1,000V ranges.
