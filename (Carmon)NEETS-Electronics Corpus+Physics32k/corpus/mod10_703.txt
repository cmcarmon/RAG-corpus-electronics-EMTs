LENGTH AND PHASING.â€”Although the 1/2 wavelength is the basis for the collinear element, 
you will find that greater lengths are often used. Effective arrays of this type have been constructed in 
which the elements are 0.7 and even 0.8 wavelength long. This type of array provides efficient operation 
at more than one frequency or over a wider frequency range. Whatever length is decided upon, all of the 
elements in a particular array should closely adhere to that length. If elements of different lengths are 
combined, current phasing and distribution are changed, throwing the system out of balance and seriously 
affecting the radiation pattern.
