Passive microrheology uses the thermal energy (kT) to move the tracers, although recent evidence suggest that active random forces inside cells may instead move the tracers in a diffusive-like manner. The trajectories of the tracers are measured optically either by microscopy or by diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS). From the mean squared displacement with respect to time (noted MSD or <Δr2> ), one can calculate the visco-elastic moduli G′(ω) and G″(ω) using the generalized Stokes–Einstein relation (GSER). Here is a view of the trajectory of a particle of micrometer size.

In a standard passive microrheology tests, the movement of dozens of tracers is tracked in a single video frame. The motivation is to average the movements of the tracers and calculate a robust MSD profile.
Observing the MSD for a wide range of integration time scales (or frequencies) gives information on the microstructure of the medium where are diffusing the tracers.
If the tracers are having a free diffusion in a purely viscous material, the MSD should grows linearly with sampling integration time:




<
Δ

r

>=
4
D
t


{\displaystyle <\Delta r^{2}>=4Dt}
.
If the tracers are moving in a spring-like fashion within a purely elastic material, the MSD should have no time dependence:




<
Δ

r

2


>=
C

{\displaystyle <\Delta r^{2}>=Const}

In most cases the tracers are presenting a sub-linear integration-time dependence, indicating the medium has intermediate viscoelastic properties. Of course, the slope changes in different time scales, as the nature of the response from the material is frequency dependent.
Microrheology is another way to do linear rheology. Since the force involved is very weak (order of 10−15 N), microrheology is guaranteed to be in the so-called linear region of the strain/stress relationship. It is also able to measure very small volumes (biological cell).

A related method of passive microrheology involves the tracking positions of a particle at high frequency, often with a quadrant photodiode. From the position,
