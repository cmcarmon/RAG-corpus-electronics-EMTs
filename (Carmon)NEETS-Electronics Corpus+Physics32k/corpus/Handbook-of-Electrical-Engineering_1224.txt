Algebraic Properties of Matrices
Many of the more important and interesting applications of signal restoration are related to the vector space
C m · n. Matrices contained in C m · n may occur in a natural manner as exempliﬁed by digital images where the
nonnegative  elements  of  the  matrix  correspond  to  the  brightness  levels  of  associated  pixels.  The  underlying
signal restoration problem in such cases is commonly referred to as image reconstruction or image restoration.
In other examples, however, the matrix under consideration may be a by-product of an associated data analysis
solution routine. For example, in approximating a ﬁnite-length time series as a sum of weighted exponentials,
one often forms an associated data matrix from the time series elements. Whatever the case, the matrix under
analysis is typically corrupted in some manner, and it is desired to remove this corruption in order to recover
the underlying information-bearing matrix. In using signal restoration for this purpose, it is necessary to employ
attributes  associated  with  the  information-bearing  signal.  These  attributes  are  normally  of  an  algebraic  or  a
structural description. In this subsection we will examine two of the more widely invoked algebraic attributes,
and some commonly employed structural attributes are examined in the next subsection.
