Frequency response is the amplitude variation with frequency over a specified bandwidth. Let’s
convert this to plain English. The frequency-response specification of a magnetic tape recorder tells you
the range of frequencies the recorder can effectively record and reproduce. What exactly does the word
effectively mean? That’s hard to say because frequency response varies from recorder to recorder, and
from manufacturer to manufacturer. But a good rule of thumb is that an effective frequency-response
specification tells the lowest and highest frequencies that the recorder can record and reproduce with no
more than + / -  3-dB difference in output amplitude.
