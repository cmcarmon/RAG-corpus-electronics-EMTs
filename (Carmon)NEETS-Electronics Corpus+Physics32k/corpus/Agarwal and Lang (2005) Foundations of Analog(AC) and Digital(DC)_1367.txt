To solve this equation, we will use the method of homogeneous and par-
ticular solutions because this method can be readily extended to higher-order
equations. As a review, the method of homogeneous and particular solutions
arises from a fundamental theorem of differential equations. The method states
that the solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation can be obtained
by summing together the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.
More specifically, let vCH(t) be any solution to the homogeneous differential
