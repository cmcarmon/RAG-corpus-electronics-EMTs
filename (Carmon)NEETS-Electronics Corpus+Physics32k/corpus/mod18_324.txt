First, letâ€™s consider a PARALLEL-CONNECTED DUPLEXER system, as shown in figure 2-14. The
tr spark gap shown in figure 2-14 is located in the receiver coupling line one-quarter wavelength from the
T-junction. A half-wavelength, closed-end section of transmission line, called a STUB, is shunted across
the main transmission line. An atr spark gap is located in this line one-quarter wavelength from the main
transmission line and one-quarter wavelength from the closed end of the stub. As shown in the figure,
antenna impedance, line impedance, and transmitter output impedance, when transmitting, are all equal.
The action of the circuit during transmission is shown in figure 2-15.
