Power system apparatuses are subjected to faults from both
man-made and natural causes. In a system that uses many
types of apparatus with costs that vary widely, it is important
that expensive apparatuses are protected from faults, even
if it is at the expense of a cheaper device. Outdoor insulators,
especially the line insulators, are one of the least expensive
devices in the power system. Therefore,
it is understand-
able that to protect a more expensive apparatus, such as a
transformer or circuit breaker in a station, a line insulator
must fail ﬁrst under overvoltages. When an insulator fails, it
is required that the failure mode is a ﬂashover rather than a
puncture.
