FIGURE 17.2
This image shows the effects of aliasing due to sampling the image at too low a rate. The image should be
straight  lines  converging  at  a  point.  Because  of  undersampling,  it  appears  as  if  there  are  patterns  in  the  lines  at  various
angles. These are known as moir√© patterns.
