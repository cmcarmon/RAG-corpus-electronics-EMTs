The voltage applied to the anode of CR1 is the vector sum of voltages ep and e1, shown as e 3 on the
diagram. Likewise, the voltage applied to the anode of CR2 is the vector sum of voltages ep and e 2,
shown as e4 on the diagram. At resonance e3 and e4 are equal, as shown by vectors of the same length.
Equal anode voltages on diodes CR1 and CR2 produce equal currents and, with equal load resistors, equal
and opposite voltages will be developed across R3 and R4. The output is taken across R3 and R4 and will
be 0 at resonance since these voltages are equal and of appositive polarity.
