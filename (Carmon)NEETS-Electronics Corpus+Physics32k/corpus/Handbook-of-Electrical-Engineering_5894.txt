Induction Generators
Conceptually, a three-phase induction machine is similar to a synchronous machine, but the former has a much
simpler  rotor  circuit. A  typical  design  of  the  rotor  is  the  squirrel-cage  structure,  where  conducting  bars  are
embedded in the rotor body and shorted out at the ends. When a set of three-phase currents (waveforms of
equal amplitude, displaced in time by one-third of a period) is applied to the stator winding, a rotating magnetic
ﬁeld is produced. (See the discussion of a revolving magnetic ﬁeld for synchronous generators in the section
“Principle of Operation”.) Currents are therefore induced in the bars, and their resulting magnetic ﬁeld interacts
with the stator ﬁeld to make the rotor rotate in the same direction. In this case, the machine acts as a motor
since, in order for the rotor to rotate, energy is drawn from the electric power source. When the machine acts
as a motor, its rotor can never achieve the same speed as the rotating ﬁeld (this is the synchronous speed) for
that would imply no induced currents in the rotor bars. If an external mechanical torque is applied to the rotor
to drive it beyond the synchronous speed, however, then electric energy is pumped to the power grid, and the
machine will act as a generator.
