If the object is inhomogeneous, one can employ the volume
equivalence principle to derive a volume integral equation
(Livesay and Chen, 1974; Schaubert et al., 1984), which con-
tains an integral over Vo, in contrast to the surface integral
equations described previously. As a result, the unknown func-
tion is distributed over the entire Vo, and its numerical solu-
tion is very computationally intensive unless some special
techniques with certain approximations are used (Borup and
Gandhi, 1984; Zwamborn and van der Berg, 1994; Gan and
Chew, 1995; Wang and Jin, 1998). Problems involving in-
homogeneous media can usually be handled more efﬁciently
using the ﬁnite element method (Jin, 1993).
