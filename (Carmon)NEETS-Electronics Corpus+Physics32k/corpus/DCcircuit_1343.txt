A transformer designed to output more voltage than it takes in across the input coil is called
a ”step-up” transformer, while one designed to do the opposite is called a ”step-down,” in ref-
erence to the transformation of voltage that takes place. The current through each respective
coil, of course, follows the exact opposite proportion.
