Transducers 
 
Transducers are devices that convert energy in the 
form of sound, light, heat, etc., into an equivalent 
electrical signal, or vice versa.  
  Before we go further, letâ€™s consider a couple of 
examples that you will already be familiar with. A 
loudspeaker  is  a  transducer  that  converts  low-
frequency  electric  current  into  audible  sounds.  A 
microphone, on the other hand, is a transducer that 
performs 
that  of 
converting  sound  pressure  variations  into  voltage 
or current. Loudspeakers and microphones can thus 
be considered as complementary transducers.  
  Transducers  may  be  used  as  both  inputs  to 
electronic circuits and outputs from them. From the 
two previous examples, it should be obvious that a 
loudspeaker is an output  transducer designed for 
use in conjunction with an audio system. Whereas, 
a microphone is an input  transducer designed for 
use with a recording or sound reinforcing system. 
  There are many different types of transducer and 
Tables  16.1  and  16.2  provide  some  examples  of 
transducers  that  can  be  used  to  input  and  output 
three 
sound, 
temperature, and angular position.
