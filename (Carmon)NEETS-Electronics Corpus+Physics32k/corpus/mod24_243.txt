A multimode step-index fiber has a core of radius (a) and a constant refractive index n1. A cladding
of slightly lower refractive index n2 surrounds the core. Figure 3-2 shows the refractive index profile n(r)
for this type of fiber. n(r) is equal to n1 at radial distances r <a (core). n(r) is equal to n2 at radial distances
r Ã¿ a (cladding). Notice the step decrease in the value of refractive index at the core-cladding interface.
This step decrease occurs at a radius equal to distance (a). The difference in the core and cladding
refractive index is the parameter D :
