A SEMICONDUCTOR TEST SET is used to measure the beta of a transistor, the resistance
appearing at the electrodes, and the reverse current of a transistor or semiconductor diode. It also
measures a shorted or open condition of a diode, the forward transconductance of a field-effect transistor,
and the condition of its own batteries.
