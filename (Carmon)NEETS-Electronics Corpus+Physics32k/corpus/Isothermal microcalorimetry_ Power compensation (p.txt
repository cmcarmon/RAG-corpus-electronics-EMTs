Some IMC instruments operate (or can also be operated) as power compensation (pc) calorimeters. In this case, in order to maintain the specimen at the set temperature, heat produced is compensated using a Peltier-Seebeck device. Heat consumed is compensated either by an electric heater or by reversing the polarity of the device (van Herwaarden, 2000). If a given instrument is operated in pc mode rather than hc, the precision of heat flow measurement remains the same (e.g. ca. ±0.2 μW). The advantage of compensation mode is a smaller time constant – i.e. the time needed to detect a given heat flow pulse is ca.10X shorter than in conduction mode. The disadvantage is a ca. 10X smaller dynamic range compared to hc mode.
