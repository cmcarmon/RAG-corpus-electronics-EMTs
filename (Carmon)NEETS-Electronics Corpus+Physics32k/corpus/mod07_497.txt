A commonly used FIGURE OF MERIT for a power supply is its PERCENT OF REGULATION. 
The figure of merit gives us an indication of how much the output voltage changes over a range of load 
resistance values. The percent of regulation aids in the determination of the type of load regulation 
needed. Percent of regulation is determined by the equation:
