This equation implies that a resistive network embedded
in GICs appears like an inductive network of the same top-
ology with the inductance matrix L ¼ T R, that is, each in-
ductor L is replaced by a resistor of value L/T. This procedure is
the Gorski-Popiel method. Its signiﬁcance is that it permits
complete inductive subnetworks to be replaced by resistive
subnetworks embedded in GICs, rather than requiring each
inductor to be treated separately. Depending on the topology
