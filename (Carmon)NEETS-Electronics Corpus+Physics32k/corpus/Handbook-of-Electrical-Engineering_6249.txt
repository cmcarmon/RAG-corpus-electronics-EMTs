• Horizontal sync pulses at the line rate.
• Vertical sync pulses at the ﬁeld rate in the form of an interval of wide horizontal sync pulses at the ﬁeld
rate.  Included  in  the  interval  are equalizing pulses at  twice  the  line  rate  to  preserve  interlace  in  each
frame between the even and odd ﬁelds (offset by a half line).
