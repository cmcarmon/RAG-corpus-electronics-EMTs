You can experience a similar attraction/repulsion phenomenon with magnets. 
If you place the north pole of a bar magnet near the south pole of a second 
bar magnet, you’ll find that the magnets attract each other. If, instead, you 
place the north pole of one magnet near the north pole of another magnet, 
you’ll observe that the magnets repel each other. This mini‐experiment gives 
you some idea of what happens with protons and electrons — without requir-
ing you to split an atom!
