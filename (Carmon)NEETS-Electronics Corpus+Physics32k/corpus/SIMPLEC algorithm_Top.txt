The SIMPLEC (Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations-Consistent) algorithm; a modified form of SIMPLE algorithm; is a commonly used numerical procedure in Computational Fluid Dynamics to solve the very famous Navier-Stokes equations.
This algorithm was developed by Van Doormal and Raithby in 1984. The algorithm follows the same steps like the SIMPLE algorithm with a little variation that the momentum equations are manipulated which allows SIMPLEC velocity correction equations to omit terms that are less significant than those omitted in SIMPLE. Basically, it tries to prevent the effects of dropping velocity neighbor correction terms.
