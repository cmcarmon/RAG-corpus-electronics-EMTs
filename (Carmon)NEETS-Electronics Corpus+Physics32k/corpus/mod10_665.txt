The ground screen in view A is composed of a series of conductors buried 1 or 2 feet (0.3 to 0.6 
meter) below the surface of the earth and arranged in a radial pattern. These conductors reduce losses in 
the ground in the immediate vicinity of the antenna. Such a radial system of conductors is usually 1/2 
wavelength in diameter.
