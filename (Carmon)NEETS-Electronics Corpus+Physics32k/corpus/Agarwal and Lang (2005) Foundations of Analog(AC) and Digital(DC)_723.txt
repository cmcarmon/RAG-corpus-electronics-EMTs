Yehaa’s sales team discovers that networking equipment company Disco Systems Inc.
buys huge quantities of adder devices from a competitor Yikes Devices, Inc. Upon further
research, the Yehaa sales team finds that the hardware systems in one of Disco’s product
lines operate under a static discipline with the following voltage thresholds:
VIL = 2 V, VIH = 3.5 V, VOL = 1.5 V and VOH = 4 V.
In other words, the mapping between voltage ranges and logical values in Disco’s static
discipline is as summarized in Figure 5.11.
