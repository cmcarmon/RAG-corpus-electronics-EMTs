Successful design of dedicated circuits requires careful algorithm and architecture considerations. For exam-
ple, for a Ô¨Åltering application, different equivalent realizations may possess different levels of concurrency. Thus,
some of these realizations may be suitable for a particular application while other realizations may not be able
to meet the sample rate requirements of the application. The lower-level architecture may be implemented in
or
a  word-serial  or  word-parallel
 
or  bit-parallel  manner.  The  synthesized  architecture  may  be  implemented  with  a  dedicated  data
digit-serial
path or shared data path. The architecture may be systolic or nonsystolic.
