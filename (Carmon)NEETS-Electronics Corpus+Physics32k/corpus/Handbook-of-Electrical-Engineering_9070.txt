Serial Impact Printing
There are two classes of technologies presently employed for serial impact printing: fully formed character and
wire matrix. The former category includes both daisywheel and typeball technologies, the latter now in little
use  for  computer  output  except  for  a  few  dedicated  word  processing  applications.  Daisywheel  technology  is
used  in  many  dedicated  word  processing  systems  and  for  some  personal  computer  systems. With  these  two
technologies, font change can be implemented by simply changing a wheel or ball, but all-points-addressable
printing for image and graphics is basically not possible. Serial wire matrix technology has for years been the
most popular output device for personal computers, but has now lost most of its market share to low-end laser
printers and thermal ink-jet.
