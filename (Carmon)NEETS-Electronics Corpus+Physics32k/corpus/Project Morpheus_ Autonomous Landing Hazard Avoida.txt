The optional Autonomous Landing Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) equipment permits landings without operator interaction. ALHAT permits the lander to fly to a specified location with high accuracy and to automatically avoid hazards including slopes greater than 5 degrees and boulders taller than 30 cm. The active sensors include a flash LIDAR, a lidar Doppler velocimeter and a laser altimeter.
