The rate of precession depends on the inclination of the orbital plane to the equatorial plane, as well as the orbital eccentricity.
For a satellite in a prograde orbit around Earth, the precession is westward (nodal regression), the node and satellite move in opposite directions. A good approximation of the precession rate is

This is equivalent to -3.683 degrees/day, so the orbit plane will make one complete turn (in inertial space) in 98 days.
The apparent motion of the sun is approximately +1° per day (360° per year / 365.2422 days per tropical year ≈ 0.9856473° per day), so apparent motion of the sun relative to the orbit plane is about 2.8° per day, resulting in a complete cycle in about 127 days. For retrograde orbits



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is negative, so the precession becomes positive. (Alternatively,



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
can be thought of as positive but the inclination is greater than 90°, so the cosine of the inclination is negative.) In this case it is possible to make the precession approximately match the apparent motion of the sun, resulting in a sun-synchronous orbit.
