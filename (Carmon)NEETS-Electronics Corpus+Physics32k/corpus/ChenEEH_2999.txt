Because FETs are commonly used in mixer circuits, this
number can be positive, resulting in a mixer with gain. In
fact, FET mixers with up to 10 dB of gain can be produced at
X-band frequencies, with lower LO requirements than with
diode mixers. Typically, this comes at the expense of degraded
noise performance.
