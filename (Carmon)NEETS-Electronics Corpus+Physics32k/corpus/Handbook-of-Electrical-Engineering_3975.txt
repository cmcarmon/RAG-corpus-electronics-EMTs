Characteristic impedance: Ratio of the voltage and current on a transmission line when there are no reﬂections.
Insertion loss: Power lost when a signal passes through a device.
Reference impedance:
Return loss: Power lost upon reﬂection from a device.
Voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR): Ratio of the maximum voltage amplitude on a line to the minimum
