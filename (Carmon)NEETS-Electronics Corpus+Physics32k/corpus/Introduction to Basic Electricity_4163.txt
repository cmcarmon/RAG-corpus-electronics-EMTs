  4.  To play a portable CD player requires three 1.5-volt batteries. When it is turned on, it is  discovered 
that the batteries are discharged. The batteries are always running down because of the amount of 
playtime. The task is to build a power supply that can be used with 120V AC. Design a regulated 
power supply that will convert 120V AC to the required DC voltage. The current draw for the unit 
must be determined through measuring with an ammeter. Model the solution in an electronic 
simulation program.
