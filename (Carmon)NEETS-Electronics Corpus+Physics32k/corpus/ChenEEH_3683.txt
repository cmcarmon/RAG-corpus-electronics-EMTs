Features that have been used to characterize speech usually
convey information about spectral properties. These include
direct spectral measures (FFT based), mappings or transform-
ations of spectral information (see the cepstrum in Section
3.3.3.), correlation information, zero-crossing measures (crude
frequency content information), model parameter estimates
(as in the linear-prediction example, or the ‘‘reﬂection coefﬁ-
cients,’’ discussed in Section 3.3.2.), and various transform-
ations of such parameters. Energy measures are also used as
conveyors of information about, for example, the presence of
voicing or for ‘‘silence/speech’’ decisions.
