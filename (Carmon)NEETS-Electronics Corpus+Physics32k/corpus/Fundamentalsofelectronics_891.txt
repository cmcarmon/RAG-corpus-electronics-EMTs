transmitted again changes: So-called data bits b (n) emerge from the source coder at an average rate B (A)
and exit the channel at a rate 1/E higher. We represent the fact that the bits sent through the digital
channel operate at a diï¬€erent rate by using the index l for the channel-coded bit stream c (l). Note that
the blocking (framing) imposed by the channel coder does not correspond to symbol boundaries in the bit
stream b (n), especially when we employ variable-length source codes.
