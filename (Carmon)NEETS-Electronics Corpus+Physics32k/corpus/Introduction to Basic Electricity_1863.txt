Meters are the means by which the invisible action of 
electrons can be detected and measured.  Meters are 
indispensable in examining the operation of a  circuit. 
Two types of meters are available. One type is the 
analog	meter, which uses a graduated scale with a 
pointer (Figure 15-1). The other type is the  digital	
meter,  which  provides  a  reading  in  numbers 
 ( Figure 15-2). Digital meters are easier to read and 
provide a more accurate reading than  analog  meters. 
However, analog meters provide a better graphic 
 display of rapid changes in current or voltage.
