In the preceding discussion we have presented a selective survey of computational electromagnetics. Attention
has been directed to radiation and scattering problems solved using the method of moments, a general procedure
applicable to differential- and integral-equation formulations developed by either the frequency domain or the
time domain. Beginning from the viewpoint of electromagnetics as a transfer-function process, we concluded
that the basic problem is one of developing source-ﬁeld relationships or ﬁeld propagators. Of the various ways
by which these propagators might be expressed, we brieﬂy discussed the Maxwell curl equations and Green’s-
function  source  integrals  as  providing  the  analytical  basis  for  moment-method  computer  models.  We  then
considered at more length some of the numerical issues involved in developing a computer model, including
the idea of sampling functions used both to represent the unknowns to be solved for and to approximate the
equations that they must satisfy. Some of the factors involved in choosing these sampling functions and their
inﬂuence on the computational requirements were examined. Next, we discussed some ways of decreasing the
needed  computer  time  based  on  either  analytical  or  numerical  approaches.  Some  closing  comments  were
directed to the important problems of validation, error checking, and error analysis. Throughout our discussion,
emphasis  has  been  given  to  implementation  issues  involved  in  developing  and  using  computer  models  as
opposed to exploring analytical details.
