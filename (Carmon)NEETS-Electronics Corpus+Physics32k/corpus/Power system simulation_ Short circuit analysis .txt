Short circuit analysis analyzes the power flow after a fault occurs in a power network. The faults may be three-phase short circuit, one-phase grounded, two-phase short circuit, two-phase grounded, one-phase break, two-phase break or complex faults. Results of such an analysis may help determine the following:
Magnitude of the fault current
Circuit breaker capacity
Rise in voltage in a single line due to ground fault
Residual voltage and relay settings
Interference due to power line.
