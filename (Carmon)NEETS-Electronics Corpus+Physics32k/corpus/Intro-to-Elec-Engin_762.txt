8.4.2 Considering the CS JFET ampliﬁer circuit of Fig-
ure 8.4.1(a), a portion of the source resistance
RSS in the JFET CS stage is sometimes left unby-
passed. Let RSS = RSS1
+ RSS2 in which RSS1 is
that portion of RSS that is not bypassed and RSS2 is
that part of RSS that is bypassed. Find expressions
for the ampliﬁer voltage gain Av1 and the current
gain Ai. Comment on the results, particularly with
reference to Equations (8.4.3) and (8.4.4).
8.4.3 The common-source ampliﬁer of Figure 8.4.1(a)
with RL = 300 , RD = 150 , and RSS =
100  (fully bypassed) has a JFET with VA = 80
V, ro = 2 k, and VP = 4 V.
(a) Compute gm and IDSS if the voltage gain is
(b) If the voltage gain is to be reduced to −1.4
by leaving part of RSS unbypassed, ﬁnd RSS1,
which is that portion of RSS that is not by-
passed.
