In the kinematical approximation for electron diffraction, the intensity of a diffracted beam is given by:

{\displaystyle I_{\mathbf {g} }=\left|\psi _{\mathbf {g} }\right|^{2}\propto \left|F_{\mathbf {g} }\right|^{2}.}

Here




ψ


g





{\displaystyle \psi _{\mathbf {g} }}
is the wavefunction of the diffracted beam and




F

{\displaystyle F_{\mathbf {g} }}
is the so-called structure factor which is given by:

{\displaystyle F_{\mathbf {g} }=\sum _{i}f_{i}e^{-2\pi i\mathbf {g} \cdot \mathbf {r} _{i}}}

where




g



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} }
is the scattering vector of the diffracted beam,





r


i




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{i}}
is the position of an atom



i


{\displaystyle i}
in the unit cell, and




f

i




{\displaystyle f_{i}}
is the scattering power of the atom, also called the atomic form factor. The sum is over all atoms in the unit cell.
The structure factor describes the way in which an incident beam of electrons is scattered by the atoms of a crystal unit cell, taking into account the different scattering power of the elements through the factor




f

i




{\displaystyle f_{i}}
. Since the atoms are spatially distributed in the unit cell, there will be a difference in phase when considering the scattered amplitude from two atoms. This phase shift is taken into account by the exponential term in the equation.
The atomic form factor, or scattering power, of an element depends on the type of radiation considered. Because electrons interact with matter though different processes than for example X-rays, the atomic form factors for the two cases are not the same.
