In the basic invariance rule, premise B1 requires that the initial
marking M0 imply property W, and premise B2 requires that
all transitions preserve W. C(t ) is the Z schema associated with
t that deﬁnes the enabling condition (precondition) and the
ﬁring result (postcondition) of t. W 0 is obtained from W by
changing the names of variables to their dashed version. Based
on premises B1 and B2, we conclude that W is valid or is
satisﬁed under any reachable marking from M0.
