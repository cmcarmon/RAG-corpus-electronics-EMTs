Figure 1-31 shows another application of a synchro capacitor; this time in a differential system in 
this circuit the capacitor is placed between a TX and a TDX. The meter readings show the same 
comparison between currents as in the previous paragraph. The only significant difference between this 
circuit and the one in figure 1-30 is that the differential draws more stator current than the CT.
