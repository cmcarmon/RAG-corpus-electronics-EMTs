Many primitive societies held property in common through tradition, thus common ownership of land is an example of customary land ownership in tribal societies which pre-dates the arrangement of colonised alienated land. Marxist theory describes this primitive communism as based on common ownership on a subsistence level. Another term for this arrangement is a "gift economy" or communalism.
