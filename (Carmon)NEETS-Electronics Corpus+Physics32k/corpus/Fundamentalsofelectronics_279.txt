When we start from scratch, the node joining the three resistors is at the same potential as the
reference, e ≈ 0, and the sum of currents ﬂowing into that node is zero. Thus, the current i ﬂowing
in the resistor RF equals v(1)
. Because the feedback resistor is essentially in parallel with
in
R1
the load resistor, the voltages must satisfy v = −vout. In this way, we obtain the input-output
relation given above.
