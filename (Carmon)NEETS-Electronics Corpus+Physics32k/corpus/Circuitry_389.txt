Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 7.50. Without the 
signal generator connected, measure and record the 
no-signal  d.c.  collector,  base  and  emitter  voltages 
for  TR1  (the  collector  voltage  should  be  in  the 
range 3 V to 6 V). Connect the signal generator and 
set  it  to  produce  a  sine  wave  output  at  1  kHz. 
Increase 
the  signal 
generator until the input voltmeter reads exactly 10 
mV. Measure and record the output signal voltage 
(see Table 7.7).  
  Repeat  at  frequencies  over  the  range  10  Hz  to  
10 kHz, at each stage recording the output voltage 
produced  in  the  table.  Replace  C1 and  C2 with  
10 ÂµF capacitors and repeat the measurements. 
 
Measurements and calculations 
Use the measured value of output voltage at 1 kHz 
in order to determine the voltage gain of the stage.
