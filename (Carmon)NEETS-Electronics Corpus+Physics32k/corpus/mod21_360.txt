The standard power meter used in the Navy (Hewlett-Packard 431 C) is an automatic self-balancing 
instrument employing dual-bridge circuits. It is designed to operate with temperature-compensated 
thermistor mounts that enable you to measure power in a 50-ohm coaxial system from 10 MHz to 18 GHz 
and in a waveguide system from 2.6 GHz to 40 GHz. This power meter can be operated from either an ac 
or a dc primary power source. The ac source can be either 115 or 230 volts at 50 to 400 hertz. The dc 
source is a 24-volt rechargeable battery. A seven-position range switch allows full-scale power 
measurements of 10 microwatts to 10 milliwatts or of âˆ’20 dBm to +10 dBm. These ranges can be further 
extended with the aid of attenuators. The thermistor mount (as shown in fig. 3-17) contains two 
thermistors: one in the detection bridge, which absorbs the microwave power to be measured, and the 
other in the compensation and metering bridge, which supplies temperature compensation and converts 
the measured rf power to a meter indication. Each bridge includes its respective thermistor element as a 
bridge arm.
