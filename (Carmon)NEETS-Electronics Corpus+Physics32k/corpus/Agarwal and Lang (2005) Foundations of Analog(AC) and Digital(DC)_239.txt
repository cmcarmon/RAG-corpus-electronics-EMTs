(cid:1) The associated variables convention defines current to flow in at the device
(cid:1) The instantaneous power consumed by a device is given by p(t) = v(t)i(t),
where v(t) and i(t) are defined using the associated variables discipline.
the instantaneous power delivered by a device is given by
Similarly,
p(t) = âˆ’v(t)i(t). The unit of power is the watt.
