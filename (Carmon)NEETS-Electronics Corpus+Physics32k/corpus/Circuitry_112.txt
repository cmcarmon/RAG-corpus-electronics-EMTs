Example 2.26 
 
A capacitance of 50 µF (rated at 100 V) is required. 
What  series  combination  of  preferred  value 
capacitors  will  satisfy  this  requirement?  What 
voltage rating should each capacitor have? 
 
Solution 
 
Two 100 µF capacitors wired in series will provide 
a capacitance of 50 µF, as follows:
