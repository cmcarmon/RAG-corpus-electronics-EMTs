When the battery is connected to the sending end as shown, a negative voltage moves down the line.
This voltage charges each capacitor, in turn, through the preceding inductor. Since Zi equals Z 0, one-half
the applied voltage will appear across the internal battery impedance, Zi, and one-half across the
impedance of the line, Z0. Each capacitor is then charged to E/2 (view B). When the last capacitor in the
line is charged, there is no voltage across the last inductor and current flow through the last inductor
stops. With no current flow to maintain it, the magnetic field in the last inductor collapses and forces
current to continue to flow in the same direction into the last capacitor. Because the direction of current
has not changed, the capacitor charges in the same direction, thereby increasing the charge in the
capacitor. Since the energy in the magnetic field equals the energy in the capacitor, the energy transfer to
the capacitor doubles the voltage across the capacitor. The last capacitor is now charged to E volts and the
current in the last inductor drops to zero.
