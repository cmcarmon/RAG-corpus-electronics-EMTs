Dry-type transformers are generally more expensive per kVa
than liquid-ﬁlled transformers but address the concern for in-
door applications. Dry-type transformers use solid insulation
systems or ﬁlm coatings and/or paper tapes. A variation is the
resin-encapsulated system (or cast coil). Dry-type transformers
have less of an ability to withstand impulse voltages than cor-
responding liquid-ﬁlled designs. Dry-type transformers are
offered in ventilated and nonventilated, totally enclosed systems
for use in hostile industrial environments. Dry-type transform-
ers are routinely offered up to 34.5 kV and 10 MVA.
