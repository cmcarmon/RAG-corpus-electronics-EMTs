This  section  describes  satellite  communications  from  the  application  point-of-view.  Since VSATs  initiated
the growth in satellite communication, a signiﬁcant portion of the section is devoted to this topic. After a review
of the satellites’ launch and their characteristics, VSAT networks are discussed in detail. Video/audio applications
are described next, along with the equipment necessary for these applications. The section is concluded with
a summary of next-generation trends.
