Applications of Spread Spectrum
Military
Antijam (AJ) Communications. As  already  noted,  one  of  the  key  applications  of  spread  spectrum  is  for
antijam communications in a hostile environment. The basic mechanism by which a direct sequence spread
spectrum  receiver  attenuates  a  noise  jammer  was  illustrated  in  Sec.  70.3.  Therefore,  in  this  section,  we  will
concentrate on tone jamming.
