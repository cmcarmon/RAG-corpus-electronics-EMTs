To find the direction of motion of a conductor, extend the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of 
your right hand so they are at right angles to each other. If the forefinger is pointed in the direction of 
magnetic flux (north to south) and the middle finger is pointed in the direction of current flow in the 
conductor, the thumb will point in the direction the conductor will move.
