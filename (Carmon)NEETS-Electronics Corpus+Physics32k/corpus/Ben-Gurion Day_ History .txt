Ben Gurion Day was created by the Israeli Knesset as part of the Ben-Gurion Law. According to the law, Ben-Gurion Day shall be held once a year, on Kislev 6, the date of David Ben-Gurion's death. On this day state memorial services shall be marked by the institutions of the State of Israel, on bases of the Israel Defense Force, and in schools. If the sixth of Kislev falls on Shabbat eve, or on Shabbat, the memorial day shall be held on the following Sunday.
