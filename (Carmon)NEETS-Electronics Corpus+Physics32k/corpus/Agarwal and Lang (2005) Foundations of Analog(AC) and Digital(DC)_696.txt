The previous section illustrated several ways to represent binary values. The
representations differed not only in the signal type (for example, current versus
voltage), but also in the signal values (for example, 5 V versus 4 V to represent a
logical 1). Because we require that digital devices built by various manufacturers
talk to each other, the devices must adhere to a common representation. The
representation must allow for large enough design margins so that devices can
be built out of a wide range of technologies. Furthermore, the representation
should be such that the devices operate correctly even in the presence of some
amount of noise.
