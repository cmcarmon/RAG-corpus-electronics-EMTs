Nutation is difficult to describe in words but easy to demonstrate. Hold a pencil in two hands. While
holding the eraser end as still as possible, swing the point in a circular motion. This motion of the pencil
is referred to as nutation; the pencil point corresponds to the open, or transmitting, end of the waveguide
antenna. The important fact to remember is that polarization of the beam is not changed during the
scanning cycle. This means that the axis of the moving feeder does not change either horizontal or vertical
orientation while the feeder is moving. You might compare the feeder movement to that of a ferris wheel;
that is, the vertical orientation of each seat remains the same regardless of the position of the wheel.
