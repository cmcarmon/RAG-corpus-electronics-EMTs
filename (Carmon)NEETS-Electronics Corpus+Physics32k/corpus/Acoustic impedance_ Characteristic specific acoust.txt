The constitutive law of nondispersive linear acoustics in one dimension gives a relation between stress and strain:

∂

∂

,


{\displaystyle p=-\rho c^{2}{\frac {\partial \delta }{\partial x}},}

where
p is the acoustic pressure in the medium;
ρ is the volumetric mass density of the medium;
c is the speed of the sound waves traveling in the medium;
δ is the particle displacement;
x is the space variable along the direction of propagation of the sound waves.
This equation is valid both for fluids and solids. In
fluids, ρc2 = K (K stands for the bulk modulus);
solids, ρc2 = K + 4/3 G (G stands for the shear modulus) for longitudinal waves and ρc2 = G for transverse waves.
Newton's second law applied locally in the medium gives

The absolute value of this specific acoustic impedance is often called characteristic specific acoustic impedance and denoted z0:

{\displaystyle z_{0}=\rho c.}

{\displaystyle {\frac {p(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)}{v(\mathbf {r} ,\,t)}}=\pm \rho c=\pm z_{0}.}

z0 varies greatly among media, especially between gas and condensed phases. Water is 800 times denser than air and its speed of sound is 4.3 times as fast as that of air. So the specific acoustic impedance of water is 3,500 times higher than that of air. This means that a sound in water with a given pressure amplitude is 3,500 times less intense than one in air with the same pressure. This is because the air, with its lower z0, moves with a much greater velocity and displacement amplitude than does water. Reciprocally, if a sound in water and another in air have the same intensity, then the pressure is much smaller in air. These variations lead to important differences between room acoustics or atmospheric acoustics on the one hand, and underwater acoustics on the other.
Besides, temperature acts on speed of sound and mass density and thus on specific acoustic impedance.
