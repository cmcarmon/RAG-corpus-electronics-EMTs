At each node on the negative ”rail” (wire 8-7-6-5) we have current splitting off the main ﬂow
to each successive branch resistor. At each node on the positive ”rail” (wire 1-2-3-4) we have
current merging together to form the main ﬂow from each successive branch resistor. This fact
should be fairly obvious if you think of the water pipe circuit analogy with every branch node
acting as a ”tee” ﬁtting, the water ﬂow splitting or merging with the main piping as it travels
from the output of the water pump toward the return reservoir or sump.
