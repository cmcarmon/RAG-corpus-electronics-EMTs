It makes sense, then, to use potentiometers (connected as rheostats, usually) as variable
resistances for range resistors. The potentiometer may be mounted inside the instrument case
so that only a service technician has access to change its value, and the shaft may be locked in
place with thread-fastening compound (ordinary nail polish works well for this!) so that it will
not move if subjected to vibration.
