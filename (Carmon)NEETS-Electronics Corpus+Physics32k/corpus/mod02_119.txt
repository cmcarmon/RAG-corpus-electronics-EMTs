 When inductors are well shielded or are located far enough apart from one another, the effect of 
mutual inductance is negligible. If there is no mutual inductance (magnetic coupling) and the inductors 
are connected in series, the total inductance is equal to the sum of the individual inductances. As a 
formula:
