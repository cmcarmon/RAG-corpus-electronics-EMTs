In a gravitational field, liquids exert pressure on the sides of a container as well as on anything within the liquid itself. This pressure is transmitted in all directions and increases with depth. If a liquid is at rest in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure, p, at any depth, z, is given by




p
=
ρ
g
z



{\displaystyle p=\rho gz\,}

where:




ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}
is the density of the liquid (assumed constant)




g



{\displaystyle g\,}
is the gravitational acceleration.
Note that this formula assumes that the pressure at the free surface is zero, and that surface tension effects may be neglected.
Objects immersed in liquids are subject to the phenomenon of buoyancy. (Buoyancy is also observed in other fluids, but is especially strong in liquids due to their high density.)
