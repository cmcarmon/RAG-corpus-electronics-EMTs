If we were to triple the voltage in our last example circuit from 10 to 30 volts and keep the
circuit resistance unchanged, we would expect the current to triple as well. Let’s try this, re-
naming our netlist ﬁle so as to not over-write the ﬁrst ﬁle. This way, we will have both versions
of the circuit simulation stored on the hard drive of our computer for future use. The following
text listing is the output of SPICE for this modiﬁed netlist, formatted as plain text rather than
as a graphic image of my computer screen:
