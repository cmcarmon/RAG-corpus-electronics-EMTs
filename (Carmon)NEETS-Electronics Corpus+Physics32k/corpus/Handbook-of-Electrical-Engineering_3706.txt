where Hx and Hy are the longitudinal and perpendicular components of ﬁeld, as indicated by the coordinates
in Fig. 36.10, N is the number of turns on the head, I is the current driving the head, and g is the gap width
of  the  head.  In  this  approximation,  the  contours  of  equal  longitudinal  ﬁeld  are  described  by  circles  which
intersect the gap corners as shown in Fig. 36.10.
