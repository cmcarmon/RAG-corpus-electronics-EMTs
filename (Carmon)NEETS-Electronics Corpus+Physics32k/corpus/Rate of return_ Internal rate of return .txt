The internal rate of return (IRR) (which is a variety of money-weighted rate of return) is the rate of return which makes the net present value of cash flows zero. It is a solution



r


{\displaystyle r}
satisfying the following equation:

{\displaystyle {\mbox{NPV}}=\sum _{t=0}^{n}{\frac {C_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}}}=0}

where:
NPV = net present value
and

{\displaystyle {C_{t}}}
= net cash flow at time




t



{\displaystyle {t}}
, including the initial value





C

{\displaystyle {C_{0}}}
and final value





C

n





{\displaystyle {C_{n}}}
, net of any other flows at the beginning and at the end respectively. (The initial value is treated as an inflow, and the final value as an outflow.)
When the internal rate of return is greater than the cost of capital, (which is also referred to as the required rate of return), the investment adds value, i.e. the net present value of cash flows, discounted at the cost of capital, is greater than zero. Otherwise, the investment does not add value.
Note that there is not always an internal rate of return for a particular set of cash flows (i.e. the existence of a real solution to the equation





NPV


=
0


{\displaystyle {\mbox{NPV}}=0}
depends on the pattern of cash flows). There may also be more than one real solution to the equation, requiring some interpretation to determine the most appropriate one.
