In a right triangle, there are several relationships which always hold true. These relationships pertain
to the length of the sides of a right triangle, and the way the lengths are affected by the angles between
them.  An understanding of these relationships, called trigonometric functions, is essential for solving
problems in a-c circuits such as power factor, impedance, voltage drops, and so forth.
