The sensitivity of the radar receiver is a measure of its ability to pick up weak signals. The greater 
the sensitivity of the receiver, the better the receiver picks up weak signals. You can determine receiver 
sensitivity by measuring the power level of the MINIMUM DISCERNIBLE SIGNAL (mds). Mds is 
defined as the weakest signal that produces a visible receiver output (on a scope). Its value is determined 
by the receiver output noise level (noise tends to obscure weak signals). Because mds measurement 
depends on the receiver noise level, measuring either mds or noise level (called NOISE FIGURE) will 
indicate receiver sensitivity.
