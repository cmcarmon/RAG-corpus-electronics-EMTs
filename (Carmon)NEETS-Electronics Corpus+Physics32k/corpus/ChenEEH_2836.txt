Recent optical systems can generate laser pulses down to 6 fs in
duration. From a technology standpoint, it is clear that con-
trolling or processing these short pulses involves understand-
ing the nature of
their interactions with materials over
enormous bandwidths and very likely in beam-intensity
regimes where material nonlinearity plays an important role.
A key factor here is material dispersion, having two compon-
ents: (1) linear dispersion (i.e., the variation of the materialâ€™s
