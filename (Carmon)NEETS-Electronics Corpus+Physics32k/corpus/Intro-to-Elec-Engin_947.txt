11.2.11 The magnetic circuit shown in Figure P11.2.11
has an iron core which can be considered to be
inÔ¨Ånitely permeable. The core dimensions are
AC = 20 cm2, g = 2 mm, and lC = 100
cm. The coil has 500 turns and draws a current
of 4 A from the source. Magnetic leakage and
fringing may be neglected. Calculate the follow-
