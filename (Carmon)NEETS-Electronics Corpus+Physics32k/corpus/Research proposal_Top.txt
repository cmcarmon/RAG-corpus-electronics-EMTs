A research proposal is a document proposing a research project, generally in the sciences or academia, and generally constitutes a request for sponsorship of that research. Proposals are evaluated on the cost and potential impact of the proposed research, and on the soundness of the proposed plan for carrying it out. Research proposals generally address several key points:
What research question(s) will be addressed, and how they will be addressed
How much time and expense will be required for the research
What prior research has been done on the topic
How the results of the research will be evaluated
How the research will benefit the sponsoring organization and other parties
