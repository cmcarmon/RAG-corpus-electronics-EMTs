Body resistance also varies depending on how contact is made with the skin: is it from hand-
to-hand, hand-to-foot, foot-to-foot, hand-to-elbow, etc.? Sweat, being rich in salts and minerals,
is an excellent conductor of electricity for being a liquid. So is blood, with its similarly high
content of conductive chemicals. Thus, contact with a wire made by a sweaty hand or open
wound will offer much less resistance to current than contact made by clean, dry skin.
