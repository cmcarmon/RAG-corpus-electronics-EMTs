It is known that the directed movement of electrons constitutes a current flow. It is also known that
the electrons do not move freely through a conductor’s crystalline structure. Some materials offer little
opposition to current flow, while others greatly oppose current flow. This opposition to current flow is
known as RESISTANCE (R), and the unit of measure is the OHM. The standard of measure for one ohm
is the resistance provided at zero degrees Celsius by a column of mercury having a cross-sectional area of
one square millimeter and a length of 106.3 centimeters. A conductor has one ohm of resistance when an
applied potential of one volt produces a current of one ampere. The symbol used to represent the ohm is
