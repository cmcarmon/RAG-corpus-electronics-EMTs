Single-Pass Devices
An example of an all-optical single-pass optical logic gate is the soliton NOR gate. It is an all-ﬁber logic gate
based on time shifts resulting from soliton dragging. A NOR gate consists of two birefringent ﬁbers connected
through a polarizing beamsplitter with the output ﬁltered by a polarizer as shown in Fig. 79.23. The clock pulse,
which provides both gain and logic level restoration, propagates along one principal axis in both ﬁbers. For
the NOR gate the ﬁber length is trimmed so that in the absence of any signal the entering clock pulse will arrive
within the output time window corresponding to a “1.” When either or both of the input signals are incident,
they interact with the clock pulse through soliton dragging and shift the clock pulse out of the allowed output
time  window  creating  a “0”  output.  In  soliton  dragging  two  temporally  coincident,  orthogonally  polarized
pulses interact in the ﬁber through cross-phase modulation and shift each other’s velocities. This velocity shift
converts into a time shift after propagating some distance in the ﬁber. To implement the device, the two input
signal  pulses g1  and g2  are  polarized  orthogonal  to  the  clock.  The  signals  are  timed  so  that g1  and  the  clock
