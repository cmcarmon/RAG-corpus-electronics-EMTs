Above the brainstem is a spherical mass of neuronal tissue called the cerebellum. This remarkable structure
is a complex monitor and modiﬁer of body movements. The cerebellum does not initiate movements, but only
modiﬁes motor control activated in other areas. Cerebellar operation is not only dependent on evolutionary
development, but relies heavily on actual use and patterns of learned motor behavior acquired throughout life.
It is for this reason that the movements of a gymnast are smooth and seemingly effortless.
