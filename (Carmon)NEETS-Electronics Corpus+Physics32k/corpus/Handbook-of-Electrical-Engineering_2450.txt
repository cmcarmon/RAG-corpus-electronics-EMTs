Self-Biasing
The biasing circuit of Fig. 24.8 is called a self-biasing circuit in that the gate-to-
source  voltage  is  derived  from  the  voltage  drop  produced  by  the  ï¬‚ow  of  drain
current through the source biasing resistor RS. It is a closed-loop system in that
variations in the JFET parameters can be partially compensated for by the biasing
circuit. The gate resistor RG is used to provide a dc return path for the gate leakage
current and is generally up in the megohm range.
