Demodulation 
 
Demodulation  is  the  reverse  of  modulation  and  is 
the  means  by  which  the  signal  information  is 
recovered 
carrier. 
is  achieved  by  means  of  a 
Demodulation 
demodulator  (sometimes  called  a  detector).  The 
output of a demodulator consists of a reconstructed 
version of the original signal information present at 
the  input  of 
the  modulator  stage  within  the 
transmitter.  We  shall  see  how  this  works  a  little 
later.
