The units of k are (a.u.)​3⁄2 (day)−1 (solar mass)−​1⁄2, where
(a.u.) is the distance for which k takes its value as defined by Gauss—the distance of the unperturbed circular orbit of a hypothetical, massless body whose orbital period is 2π/k days,
(day) is the mean solar day,
(solar mass) is the mass of the Sun.
Therefore, the dimensions of k are
length​3⁄2 time−1 mass−​1⁄2 or L​3⁄2 T−1 M−​1⁄2.
Because k2 = G, the Newtonian gravitational constant, the dimensions of k2 are the same as G: L3 T−2 M−1.
