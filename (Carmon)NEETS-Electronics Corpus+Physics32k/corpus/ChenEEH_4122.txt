If the two bit streams, I and Q, are offset by 1/2 a bit interval,
then the amplitude ï¬‚uctuations are minimized because the
phase never changes by 1808 (see Figures 4.6 and 4.7). This
modulation scheme, offset quadrature phase shift keying
(OQPSK),
is obtained from the conventional quadrature
phase shift keying by delaying the odd-bit stream by a half-
bit interval with respect to the even bit stream. Thus, the range
