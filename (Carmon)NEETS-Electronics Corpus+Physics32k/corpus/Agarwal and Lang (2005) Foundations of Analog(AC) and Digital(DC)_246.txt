To make the problem specific, suppose that we wish to find the current
i4 in Figure 2.1, given the values of the voltage source and the resistors. In
general, we can resort to Maxwell’s Equations to solve the circuit. But this
approach is really impractical. Instead, when circuits obey the lumped matter
discipline, Maxwell’s Equations can be dramatically simplified into two algebraic
relationships stated as Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) and Kirchhoff’s current law
(KCL). This chapter introduces these algebraic relationships and then uses them
to develop a systematic approach to solving circuits, thereby finding the current
i4 in our specific example.
