Thus, in the circuit of figure 1-20, view (B), the parallel-LC circuit replaces the capacitor of figure 1-
16, view (B). If this circuit is tuned to the same frequency as the series-LC circuit, it will provide a path 
for all currents having frequencies outside the limits of the frequency band passed by the series-resonant 
circuit. The simplest type of bandpass filter is formed by connecting the two LC circuits as shown in 
figure 1-20, view (C). The upper and lower frequency limits of the filter action are filter cutoff points.
