where z describes the complex frequency variable of the ori-
ginal scaled low-pass Ô¨Ålter, possibly taken from tables, and s is
the variable of the network to be realized. The meaning of v0
will become clear later. Multiply both sides of equation 4.32 by
L. On the left is the impedance of an inductor. Simple arith-
metic operations lead to:
