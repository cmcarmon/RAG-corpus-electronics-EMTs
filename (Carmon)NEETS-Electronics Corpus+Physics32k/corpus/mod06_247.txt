While this may sound complicated, it really isn't. Look at figure 1-28. Here you see in view A a
triode with a +1 volt input signal. At this grid voltage, current through the tube is at 1 milliampere. If the
input voltage is raised to +3 volts, current through the tube increases to 2 milliamperes. The change in Eg
(¨Eg) is then 2 volts. This is shown in view B. Suppose that the grid voltage is returned to +1 volt, and the
plate voltage is increased until the ammeter in view C reads 2 milliamperes of plate current. At this point
plate voltage is measured. Plate voltage had to be increased by 100 volts (350-250) to get the same
change in plate current (1 mA). The change in plate voltages (¨Ep) is then 100 volts. The amplification
