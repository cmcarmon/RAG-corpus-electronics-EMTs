Balance point temperature is frequently used in modeling as a base by which to calculate the energy demand of buildings due to various stressors. This is achieved by calculating HDD or CDD based on the balance point, and extending these results to estimate energy use. A sensitivity analysis can also be conducted based on the effects of changing the balance point temperature, which may demonstrate the effect on a model of altering internal loads or envelope conditions of a building.
