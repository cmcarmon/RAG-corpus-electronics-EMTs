Like the incident polarization unit vector in equation 6.70, the
equations in Section 6.2.7 may also be used here to determine
the various parameters for the receive polarization unit vector
^rrR. It may be noted that, in contrast with equation 6.70,
equation 6.77 has a positive sign before zR. The rotational
parameter zR as a rule follows the same convention as for z,
which is different from the rule for the incident wave zi
