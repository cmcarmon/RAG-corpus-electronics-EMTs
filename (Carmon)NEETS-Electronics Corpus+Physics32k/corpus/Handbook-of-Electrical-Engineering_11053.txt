Magnetic (Eddy-Current) Stimulation
When scalp electrodes are used to stimulate the brain, there is considerable skin sensation under the electrodes
owing  to  the  high  perimeter  current  density  [Overmeyer  et  al.  1979].  It  has  been  found  that  sufﬁcient  eddy
current can be induced in living tissue by discharging an energy-storage capacitor into an air-cored coil placed
on the skin. This mode of stimulation is almost without skin sensation; by some it is called “ouchless stimulation”
