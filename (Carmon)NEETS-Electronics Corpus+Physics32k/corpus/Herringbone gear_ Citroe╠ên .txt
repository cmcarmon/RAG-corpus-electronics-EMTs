The logo of the car maker Citroën is a graphic representation of a herringbone gear, reflecting André Citroën's earlier involvement in the manufacture of these gears. Early Mors and Citroën cars used a herringbone bevel gear final drive in the rear axle.
Panhard Dyna X and successor cars (1948–67) used double helical gears in the transaxle and for the camshaft timing gears in the engine.
