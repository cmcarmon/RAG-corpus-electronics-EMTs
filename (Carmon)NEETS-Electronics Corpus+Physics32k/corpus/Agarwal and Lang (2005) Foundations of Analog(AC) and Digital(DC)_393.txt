The analysis of circuits with idealized dependent sources admits one other
simplification. In an idealized dependent source, the input port (or control port)
is an open circuit if the guiding variable is a voltage. Similarly, the input is a
short circuit if the guiding variable is a current. Thus, the presence of the input
port does not really affect the behavior of the input part of the circuit. The
idealized input port is simply present to sample the value of a branch current or
voltage without changing the value of the existing branch variable. Therefore,
we do not really need to show the input port of the dependent source explicitly,
thereby reducing the number of branch variables that we have to deal with.
