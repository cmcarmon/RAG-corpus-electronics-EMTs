Suppose you’re building a circuit that calls for a 0.1 μF disc capacitor. You 
can convert microfarads into picofarads to figure out what marking to look 
for on the capacitor package. Just move the decimal point six places to the 
right, and you get 100,000 pF. Because the three‐digit marking consists of the 
first two digits of your pF value (10) followed by the additional number of 
zeros (4), you’ll need a mica disc capacitor labeled 104.
