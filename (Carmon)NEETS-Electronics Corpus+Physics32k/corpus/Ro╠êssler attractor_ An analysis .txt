Some of the Rössler attractor's elegance is due to two of its equations being linear; setting



z
=
0


{\displaystyle z=0}
, allows examination of the behavior on the



x
,
y


{\displaystyle x,y}
plane






{






d
x


d
t



=
−
y







d
y


d
t



=
x
+
a
y








{\displaystyle {\begin{cases}{\frac {dx}{dt}}=-y\\{\frac {dy}{dt}}=x+ay\end{cases}}}

The stability in the



x
,
y


{\displaystyle x,y}
plane can then be found by calculating the eigenvalues of the Jacobian





(



0


−

a



)




{\displaystyle {\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\1&a\\\end{pmatrix}}}
, which are



(
a
±



a

2


−
4


)

/

2


{\displaystyle (a\pm {\sqrt {a^{2}-4}})/2}
. From this, we can see that when



0
<
a
<
2


{\displaystyle 0<a<2}
, the eigenvalues are complex and both have a positive real component, making the origin unstable with an outwards spiral on the



x
,
y


{\displaystyle x,y}
plane. Now consider the



z


{\displaystyle z}
plane behavior within the context of this range for



a


{\displaystyle a}
. So long as



x


{\displaystyle x}
is smaller than



c


{\displaystyle c}
, the



c


{\displaystyle c}
term will keep the orbit close to the



x
,
y


{\displaystyle x,y}
plane. As the orbit approaches



x


{\displaystyle x}
greater than



c


{\displaystyle c}
, the



z


{\displaystyle z}
-values begin to climb. As



z


{\displaystyle z}
climbs, though, the



−
z


{\displaystyle -z}
in the equation for



d
x

/

d
t


{\displaystyle dx/dt}
stops the growth in



x


{\displaystyle x}
.
