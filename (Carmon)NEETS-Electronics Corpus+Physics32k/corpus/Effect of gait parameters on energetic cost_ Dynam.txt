In dynamic walking, the human body can be modeled as the center of mass (COM) supported by a massless rigid leg in single support and two massless legs during double-support, which is consistent with passive dynamics of the inverted pendulum, otherwise known as the inverted pendulum theory of gait. In single support, no work is done since the ground reaction force is perpendicular to the COM motion. In double support, the trailing leg works in conjunction with the leading leg to redirect the COM motion upward. During this step-to-step transition period, the trailing leg exerts positive mechanical work on the COM while the leading leg exerts negative mechanical work on the COM. To maintain steady walking gait requires the sum of these work terms, or the net work, to be equal to zero since any changes in system energy would impart different COM velocities between the start and end of transition. While the ideal net mechanical work of this system is zero, muscle contractions are necessary to generate the ground reaction forces, implying that the metabolic energy expended is nonzero.
