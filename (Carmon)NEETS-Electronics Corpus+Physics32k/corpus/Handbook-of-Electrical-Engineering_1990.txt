represents a ﬁnite impulse response (FIR) ﬁlter with length N. The memory organization for the coefﬁcients
h(k) and the input samples x(n – k) is shown in Table 18.1. The coefﬁcients are placed within a speciﬁed internal
program memory space and the input samples within a speciﬁed data memory space. The program counter
(PC) initially points at the memory location that contains the last coefﬁcient h(N – 1), for example at memory
address  FF00h  (in  hex).  One  of  the  (8)  auxiliary  registers  points  at  the  memory  address  of  the  last  or  least
recent input sample. The most recent sample is represented by x(n). The following program segment implements
