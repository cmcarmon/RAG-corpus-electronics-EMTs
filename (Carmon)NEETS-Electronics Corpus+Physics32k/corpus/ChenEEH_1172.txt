Charge sharing noise is caused by charge redistribution
between a dynamic evaluation node and intermediate nodes
in pull-up or pull-down logic stack, as in Figure 7.5. This
primarily impacts domino nodes, weakly driven pass gate
latches, and dynamic latches. The primary technology variable
here is the ratio of junction capacitance to gate and intercon-
nect capacitance. For most circuits, this noise is not dramatic-
ally changing with technology scaling.
