General Transistor Level Design of CMOS Circuits
The previous section has emphasized the CAD tools and general design steps involved in designing an ASIC.
A top-down approach was emphasized, with the designer addressing successively more-detailed portions of the
overall design through a hierarchical organization of the overall description of the function. However, the design
process also presumes a considerable understanding of the bottom-up principles through which the overall IC
function will eventually appear as a fully detailed speciÔ¨Åcation of the transistor and interconnection structures
throughout the overall IC [Dillinger, 1988; Weste and Eshraghian, 1993; Wolf, 1994; Rabaey, 1996; Kang and
Leblebici, 1996].
