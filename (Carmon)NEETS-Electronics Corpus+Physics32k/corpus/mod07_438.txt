A comparison of the waveforms shown in figure 4-16 (view A and view B) illustrates that the 
addition of C1 to the circuit results in an increase in the average of the output voltage (Eavg) and a 
reduction in the amplitude of the ripple component (Er) which is normally present across the load 
resistance.
