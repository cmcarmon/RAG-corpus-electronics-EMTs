According to Ohmâ€™s law, if the resistance in a circuit is extremely small, the current will be
extremely large. Therefore, when a direct short occurs, there will be a very large current through the
wires. Suppose, for instance, that the two leads from a battery to a motor came in contact with each other.
If the leads were bare at the point of contact, there would be a direct short. The motor would stop running
