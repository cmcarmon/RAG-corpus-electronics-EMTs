Transmission that is dc is not covered in this section although
its usage is increasing around the world. The main use of dc
transmission is to interconnect two separate areas where some
power transfer is desirable but a synchronous (ac) connection is
not. The main features of such an interconnection are the ac–dc
conversion and the dc–ac inversion that allows the connection
of two ac systems with a dc line. The design of the line itself—
two wires with or without a ground wire—is not particularly
different from ac transmission. In some cases, where the geo-
graphic distance between the two separate ac areas is small, the
interconnection may not even require a dc transmission line but
only back to back ac–dc and dc–ac converters.
