Next, set your multimeter to the DC current setting. Interrupt the circuit at 
any of the connection points and insert your multimeter, remembering to 
keep the positive lead at a higher voltage than the negative lead. When I did 
this, I got a reading of 1.4 mA. That amount of current flows through each 
component in this series circuit because there is only one path for current 
toÂ flow.
