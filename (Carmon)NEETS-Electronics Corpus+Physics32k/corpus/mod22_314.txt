It is important to remember program coding is not the first step of programming. Too often we have 
a tendency to start coding too soon. As we just discussed, a great deal of planning and preparation must 
be done before sitting down to code the computer instructions to solve a problem. For the example 
amortization problem (fig. 3-6), we have analyzed the specifications in terms of (1) the output desired; (2) 
the operations and procedures required to produce the output; and (3) the input data needed. In 
conjunction with this analysis, we have developed a programming flowchart that outlines the procedures 
for taking the input data and processing it into usable output. You are now ready to code the instructions 
that will control the computer during processing. This requires that you know a programming language.
