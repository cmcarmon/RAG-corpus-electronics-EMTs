Pipelining of algorithms can increase the sample rate of the system. Sometimes, for a constant sample rate,
pipelining can also reduce the power consumed by the system. This is because the data paths in the pipelined
system can be charged or discharged with lower supply voltage. Since the capacitance remains almost constant,
the  power  can  be  reduced.  Achieving  low  power  can  be  important  in  many  battery-powered  applications
[Chandrakasan et al., 1992].
