The multiplier circuit itself can be thought of as another op-amp with a feedback resistor
whose value is determined by a second input voltage. Multiplication circuits with the ability
to handle input voltages of either sign (four-quadrant multipliers) are available as integrated
circuits and have a number of direct uses as multipliers. But when used in a feedback loop
around an operational ampliﬁer, other useful functional forms result.
