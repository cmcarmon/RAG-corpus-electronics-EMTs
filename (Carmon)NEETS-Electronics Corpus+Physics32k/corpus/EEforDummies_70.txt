Franklin knew that electricity was both dangerous and powerful, and his 
work had people wondering whether there was a way to use the power of 
electricity for practical applications. Scientists such as Michael Faraday, 
Thomas Edison, and others took Franklinâ€™s work further and figured out ways 
to harness electrical energy and put it to good use.
