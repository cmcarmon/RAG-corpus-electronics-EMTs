PRIMARY CELL CHEMISTRY is the process in which electrons leaving the cathode to the load 
cause a positive charge which attracts negative ions from the electrolyte. The negative ions combine with 
the material of the cathode and form a substance such as lead-sulfate. Electrons from the load to the anode 
create a negative charge which attracts positive ions (hydrogen) from the electrolyte.
