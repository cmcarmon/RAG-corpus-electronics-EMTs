In  Fig.  29.29(a),  one  node  of  the  load  resistor  is  grounded.  As  a  consequence,  one  node  of  the  negative
resistor was grounded and it was appropriate to use the op amp negative resistor. Sometimes a VCCS is needed
to cause a current in an ungrounded load resistance. In this case the negative resistor must also be ungrounded
so the current conveyor negative resistor is used. In Fig. 29.29(c) the current conveyor negative resistor is used
to implement a VCCS that supplies current to an ungrounded resistor RL.
