The importance of electronics technology for consumers, and the electronics sector for the global economy, is
already substantial and continues to grow rapidly. Such growth and innovation coupled with the global concerns
for the environment and the need to better manage the resources of the earth pose many challenges for the
electronics industry. While thought of as a “clean” industry, the technological advances made by the industry
creates  a  signiﬁcant  demand  on  the  earth’s  resources.  As  an  example,  the  amount  of  water  required  in  the
production of semiconductors, the engines that motor most of today’s electronic gadgets, is enormous—about
2000 gallons to process a single silicon wafer. Building silicon chips requires the use of highly toxic materials,
albeit  in  relatively  low  volumes.  Similarly,  printed  wiring  boards  present  in  most  electronic  products  and
produced in high volume use large amounts of solvents or gases which are either health hazards, ozone depleting,
or contribute to the greenhouse effect and contain lead solder. The challenge for the industry is to continue
the innovation that delivers the products and services that people want yet ﬁnd creative solutions to minimize
the environmental impact, enhance competitiveness, and address regulatory issues without impacting quality,
productivity, or cost; in other words, to become an industry that is more “eco-efﬁcient”. Eco-efﬁciency is reached
by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and support a high quality
of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and resource intensity, to a level at least in line with the
earth’s estimated carrying capacity.
