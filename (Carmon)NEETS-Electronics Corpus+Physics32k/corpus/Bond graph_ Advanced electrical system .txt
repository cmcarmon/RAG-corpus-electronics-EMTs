A more advanced electrical system with a current source, resistors, capacitors, and a transformer

Following the steps with this circuit will result in the bond graph below, before it is simplified. The nodes marked with the star denote the ground.

Simplifying the bond graph will result in the image below.

Lastly, applying causality will result in the bond graph below. It should be noted that the bond with star denotes a causal conflict.
