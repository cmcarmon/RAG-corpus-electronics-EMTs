Gas

Start drafting fan (if the furnace is relatively recent) to create a column of air flowing up the chimney
Heat ignitor or start spark-ignition system
Open gas valve to ignite main burners
Wait (if furnace is relatively recent) until the heat exchanger is at proper operating temperature before starting main blower fan or circulator pump

Oil

Similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start an oil pump to inject oil into the burner

Electric

The blower fan or circulator pump will be started, and a large electromechanical relay or TRIAC will turn on the heating elements

Coal (including grains such as corn, wheat, and barley, or pellets made of wood, bark, or cardboard)

Generally rare today (though grains and pellets are increasing in popularity); similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start a screw to drive coal/grain/pellets into the firebox

With non-zoned (typical residential, one thermostat for the whole house) systems, when the thermostat's R (or Rh) and W terminals are connected, the furnace will go through its start-up procedure and produce heat.
With zoned systems (some residential, many commercial systems â€” several thermostats controlling different "zones" in the building), the thermostat will cause small electric motors to open valves or dampers and start the furnace or boiler if it's not already running.
Most programmable thermostats will control these systems.
