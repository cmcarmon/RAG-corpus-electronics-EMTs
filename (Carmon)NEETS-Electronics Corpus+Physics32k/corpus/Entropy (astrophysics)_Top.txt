In astrophysics, what is referred to as "entropy" is actually the adiabatic constant derived as follows.
Using the first law of thermodynamics for a quasi-static, infinitesimal process for a hydrostatic system

.



{\displaystyle dQ=dU-dW.\,}

For an ideal gas in this special case, the internal energy, U, is only a function of the temperature T; therefore the partial derivative of heat capacity with respect to T is identically the same as the full derivative, yielding through some manipulation

{\displaystyle dQ=C_{V}dT+P\,dV.}

Further manipulation using the differential version of the ideal gas law, the previous equation, and assuming constant pressure, one finds

For an adiabatic process

and recalling

One can solve this simple differential equation to find
