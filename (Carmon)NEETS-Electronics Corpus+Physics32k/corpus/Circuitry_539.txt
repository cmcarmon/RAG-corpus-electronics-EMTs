 
Interrupts 
 
A program that simply executes a loop indefinitely 
has  a  rather  limited  practical  application.  In  most 
microprocessor  systems  we  want  to  be  able  to 
interrupt  the  normal  sequence  of  program  flow  in 
order to alert the microprocessor to the need to do 
something. We can do this with a signal known as 
an  interrupt. There  are  two  types  of  interrupt;  
maskable and non-maskable. 
  When  a  non-maskable 
is 
asserted,  the  processor  must  suspend  execution  of 
the current instruction and respond immediately to 
the interrupt. In the case of a maskable interrupt,
