Now consider the circuit when a decrease in load resistance takes place. When RL decreases, the 
current through R L subsequently increases to 6 amperes. This action causes a total of 11 amperes to flow 
through RS which then drops 22 volts. As a result, the output is 98 volts. However, the regulating device 
(RV) senses this change and increases its resistance so that less current (4 amperes) flows through RV. The 
total current again becomes 10 amperes, and the output is again 100 volts.
