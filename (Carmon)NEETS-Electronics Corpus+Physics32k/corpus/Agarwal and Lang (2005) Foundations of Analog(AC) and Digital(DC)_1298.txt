Now consider the circuit shown in Figure 9.33. In this circuit, the voltage
V from the source must also appear across the inductor, just as it appeared
across the capacitor in Figure 9.32. Thus, following Equation 9.30, the current
circulating through both the inductor and the voltage source is given by
