One conclusion that can be drawn from Eqs. (113.8) and (113.9) is that a second spatial derivative of voltage
(or  equivalently  a  ﬁrst  derivative  of  the  electric  ﬁeld)  must  exist  along  the  long  axis  of  an  excitable  ﬁber  in
order  to  support  excitation.  Nevertheless,  excitation  is  possible  in  a  locally  constant  electric  ﬁeld  where  the
ﬁber  is  terminated  or  where  it  bends.  The  orientation  change  or  the  termination  creates  the  equivalent  of  a
spatial derivative of the applied ﬁeld. Stimulation at “ends and bends” can be the dominant mode of excitation
in many cases.
