The bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) programming approach
is of interest because it promises the achievement of all the
goals mentioned at the beginning of this section: software
correctness, portability, and scalable performance (McColl,
1996). The approach is applicable to SMP, cluster, and
NUMA architectures. Just as for MPI, libraries exist to support
BSP programming in standard sequential languages such as
FORTRAN and C. There is also a rigorous theoretical founda-
tion (Valiant, 1990) that allows the development of scalable
BSP programs.
