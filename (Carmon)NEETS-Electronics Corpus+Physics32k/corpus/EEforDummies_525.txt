Stepping up, stepping down voltages
If the number of turns in the primary winding of a transformer is not the 
same as the number of turns in the secondary winding, the voltage induced 
in the secondary will be different from the voltage across the primary. The 
two voltages will be proportional to each other, with the proportion deter-
mined by the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary to the number of 
turns in the primary, as follows:
