Modern IC regulators are low in cost and easy to 
use. Most IC regulators have only three terminals (in-
put, output, and ground) and can be connected directly 
to the filtered output of a rectifier (Figure  36-29). The 
IC regulator provides a wide variety of output voltages 
of both positive and negative polarities. If a voltage is 
needed that is not a standard voltage, adjustable IC 
regulators are available.
