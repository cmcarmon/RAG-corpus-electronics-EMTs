The spin of the ball will affect its trajectory through the Magnus effect. According to the Kutta–Joukowski theorem for a spinning sphere with an inviscid flow of air, the Magnus force is equal to

{\displaystyle F_{\text{M}}={\frac {8}{3}}\pi r^{3}\rho \omega v,}

where r is the radius of the ball, ω the angular velocity (or spin rate) of the ball, ρ the density of air, and v the velocity of the ball relative to air. This force is directed perpendicular to the motion and perpendicular to the axis of rotation (in the direction of

{\displaystyle F_{\text{M}}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho C_{\text{L}}Av^{2},}

where ρ is the density of air, CL the lift coefficient, A the cross-sectional area of the ball, and v the velocity of the ball relative to air. The lift coefficient is a complex factor which depends amongst other things on the ratio rω/v, the Reynolds number, and surface roughness. In certain conditions, the lift coefficient can even be negative, changing the direction of the Magnus force (reverse Magnus effect).
In sports like tennis or volleyball, the player can use the Magnus effect to control the ball's trajectory (e.g. via topspin or backspin) during flight. In golf, the effect is responsible for slicing and hooking which are usually a detriment to the golfer, but also helps with increasing the range of a drive and other shots. In baseball, pitchers use the effect to create curveballs and other special pitches.
Ball tampering is often illegal, and is often at the centre of cricket controversies such as the one between England and Pakistan in August 2006. In baseball, the term 'spitball' refers to the illegal coating of the ball with spit or other substances to alter the aerodynamics of the ball.
