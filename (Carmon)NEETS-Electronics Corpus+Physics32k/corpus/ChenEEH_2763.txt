Figures 9.8(A) and 9.8(B) repeat the above examples but for
a Gaussian pulse having a 40-grid-cell spatial width between its
1/e points. We see that the calculated pulse propagation for
S ¼ 0:99 shows no observable difference relative to the perfect
propagation case of S ¼ 1. Even for S ¼ 0:5, the calculated
propagation shows only a slight retardation relative to the
exact solution, as expected, because ~vvp < c for virtually all
modes in the grid. Further, there is no observable superluminal
precursor. All of these phenomena result from the fact that, for
this case, virtually the entire spatial spectrum of propagating
wavelengths in the grid is well resolved by the grid’s sampling
process. As a result, almost all numerical phase-velocity errors
relative to c are well below 1%. This allows the Gaussian pulse
to ‘‘hold together’’ while propagating over signiﬁcant distances
in the grid.
