For example, the audio signal taken from a record is too small to drive a speaker, so amplification is 
needed. The signal will be amplified several times between the needle of the record player and the 
speaker. Each time the signal is amplified it is said to go through a STAGE of amplification. The audio 
amplifier shown connected between the turntable and speaker system in figure 1-1 contains several stages 
of amplification.
