Receptor: Large  protein  molecule  that  usually  protrudes  from,  and  is  embedded  in,  the  membrane  of  a
eucaryotic  (nucleus-containing)  cell.  The  part  of  the  receptor  outside  the  cell  binds  only  to  selected
molecules  that  then  cause  chemical  activity  of  proteins  bound  to  the  end  at  the  cell  interior. Activity
continues as long as a single molecule (for example, of a hormone, the ﬁrst “messenger”) is bound to
the exterior part, and many molecules of a “second messenger” are released on the cell interior.
