According to Weber electrodynamics, the force (F) acting simultaneously on point charges q1 and q2, is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} ={\frac {q_{1}q_{2}\mathbf {\hat {r}} }{4\pi \epsilon _{0}r^{2}}}\left(1-{\frac {{\dot {r}}^{2}}{2c^{2}}}+{\frac {r{\ddot {r}}}{c^{2}}}\right),}

where r is the vector connecting q1 and q2, the dots over r denote time derivatives and c is the speed of light. In the limit that speeds and accelerations are small (i.e.

{\displaystyle {\dot {r}}\ll c}

This can be derived from the potential energy

In Maxwell's equations, by contrast, the force F on a charge from nearby charges can be calculated by combining Jefimenko's equations with the Lorentz force law. The corresponding potential energy is approximately:

{\displaystyle U_{Max}\approx {\frac {q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}r}}\left(1-{\frac {\mathbf {v_{1}} \cdot \mathbf {v_{2}} +(\mathbf {v_{1}} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {r}} )(\mathbf {v_{2}} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {r}} )}{2c^{2}}}\right).}

where v1 and v2 are the velocities of q1 and q2, respectively, and where relativistic and retardation effects are omitted for simplicity; see Darwin Lagrangian.
Using these expressions, the regular form of Ampère's law and Faraday's law can be derived. Importantly, Weber electrodynamics does not predict an expression like the Biot–Savart law and testing differences between Ampere's law and the Biot–Savart law is one way to test Weber electrodynamics.
