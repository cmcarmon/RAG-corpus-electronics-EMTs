In figure 4-11, view A, the radiation pattern of the flashlight is graphed in rectangular coordinates. 
The illustration of the flashlight beam in view B clearly indicates the shape of the flashlight beam. This is 
not evident in the radiation pattern plotted on the rectangular-coordinate graph. Now look at figure 4-12. 
The radiation pattern shown in this figure looks very much like the actual flashlight beam. The pattern in 
figure 4-12 is plotted using the same values as those of figure 4-11, view A, but is drawn using polar 
coordinates.
