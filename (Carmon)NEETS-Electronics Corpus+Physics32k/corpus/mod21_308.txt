The third arm of the bridge is the detector circuit. The detector circuit may use a galvanometer for 
sensitive measurements that require high accuracy. In the case of bridges using ac as the power source, 
the galvanometer must be adapted for use in an ac circuit. In many practical bridge circuits using ac to 
operate the bridge, an electron-ray indicating tube is used to indicate the balanced condition by opening 
and closing the shadow area of the tube. Headsets are also used for audible balance detection, but this 
method reduces the accuracy obtainable with the bridge.
