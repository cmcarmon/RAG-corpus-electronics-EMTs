People have used light to transmit information for hundreds of years. However, it was not until the
1960s, with the invention of the laser, that widespread interest in optical (light) systems for data
communications began. The invention of the laser prompted researchers to study the potential of fiber
optics for data communications, sensing, and other applications. Laser systems could send a much larger
amount of data than telephone, microwave, and other electrical systems. The first experiment with the
laser involved letting the laser beam transmit freely through the air. Researchers also conducted
experiments letting the laser beam transmit through different types of waveguides. Glass fibers, gas-filled
pipes, and tubes with focusing lenses are examples of optical waveguides.
