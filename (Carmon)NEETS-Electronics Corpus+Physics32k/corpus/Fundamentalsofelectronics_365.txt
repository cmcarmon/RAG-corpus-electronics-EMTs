The phase plot shown in Figure 4.2 (Periodic Pulse Sequence) requires some explanation as it does not seem
to agree with what (4.10) suggests. There, the phase has a linear component, with a jump of π every time
the sinusoidal term changes sign. We must realize that any integer multiple of 2π can be added to a phase
at each frequency without aﬀecting the value of the complex spectrum. We see that at frequency index 4,
the phase is nearly −π. The phase at index 5 is undeﬁned because the magnitude is zero in this example. At
index 6, the formula suggests that the phase of the linear term should be less than (more negative than) −π.
In addition, we expect a shift of −π in the phase between indices 4 and 6. Thus, the phase value predicted
by the formula is a little less than −2π. Because we can add 2π without aﬀecting the value of the spectrum
at index 6, the result is a slightly negative number as shown. Thus, the formula and the plot do agree. In
phase calculations like those made in MATLAB, values are usually conﬁned to the range [−π, π) by adding
some (possibly negative) multiple of 2π to each phase value.
