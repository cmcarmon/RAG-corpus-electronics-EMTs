There are two ways to apply the Laplace transform for the
solution of electrical circuits. In one method, the differen-
tial equations for the circuit are ﬁrst obtained, and then the
differential equations are solved using the Laplace transform.
In the second method, the circuit elements are converted
into s-domain functions and KCL and KVL are applied to
the s-domain circuit to obtain the needed current or voltage
in the s-domain. The current or voltage in time domain is
obtained using the inverse Laplace transform. The second
method is simpler and is illustrated here.
Let the Laplace transform of {v(t)} ¼ V (s) and Laplace
transform of {i(t )} ¼ I(s). Then the s-domain voltage current
relations of the R, L, and C elements are obtained as follows.
Consider a resistor with the v–i relation:
