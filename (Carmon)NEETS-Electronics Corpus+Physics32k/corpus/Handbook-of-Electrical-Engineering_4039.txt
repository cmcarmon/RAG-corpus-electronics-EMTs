Floating grounds are used to isolate circuits or equipment from a common ground plane. Static charges are
a hazard with this type of ground. Dangerous voltages may develop or a noise-producing discharge might occur.
Generally,  bleeder  resistors  are  used  to  control  the  static  problem.  Floating  grounds  are  useful  only  at  low
frequencies where capacitive coupling paths are negligible.
