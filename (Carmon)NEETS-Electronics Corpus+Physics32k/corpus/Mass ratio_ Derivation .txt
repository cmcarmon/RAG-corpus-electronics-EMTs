The definition arises naturally from Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation:




Δ
v
=

v

e


ln
⁡



m

0



m

1






{\displaystyle \Delta v=v_{e}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}}

where

Δv is the desired change in the rocket's velocity
ve is the effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse)
m0 is the initial mass (rocket plus contents plus propellant)
m1 is the final mass (rocket plus contents)

This equation can be rewritten in the following equivalent form:







m

0



m

1




=

e

Δ
v

/


v

e






{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}=e^{\Delta v/v_{e}}}

The fraction on the left-hand side of this equation is the rocket's mass ratio by definition.
This equation indicates that a Δv of



n


{\displaystyle n}
times the exhaust velocity requires a mass ratio of




e

n




{\displaystyle e^{n}}
. For instance, for a vehicle to achieve a



Δ
v


{\displaystyle \Delta v}
of 2.5 times its exhaust velocity would require a mass ratio of




e

2.5




{\displaystyle e^{2.5}}
(approximately 12.2). One could say that a "velocity ratio" of



n


{\displaystyle n}
requires a mass ratio of




e

n




{\displaystyle e^{n}}
.
Sutton defines the mass ratio inversely as:





M

R


=



m

1



m

0






{\displaystyle M_{R}={\frac {m_{1}}{m_{0}}}}

In this case, the values for mass fraction are always less than 1.
