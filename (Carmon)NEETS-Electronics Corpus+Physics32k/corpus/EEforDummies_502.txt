Reading inductance values
The value of an inductor is typically marked on its package using the same 
color‐coding technique used for resistors, which you can read about in 
Chapter 5. You can often find the value of larger inductors printed directly on 
the components. Smaller‐value inductors look a lot like low‐wattage resistors; 
such inductors and resistors even have similar color‐coding marks. Larger‐
value inductors come in a variety of sizes and shapes each offering trade-offs 
in terms of performance, cost, and other factors.
