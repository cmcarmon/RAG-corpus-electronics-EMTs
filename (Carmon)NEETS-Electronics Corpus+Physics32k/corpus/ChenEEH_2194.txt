Magnetic circuit analysis is illustrated with the speciﬁc
example of the toroid shown in Figure 1.12(A). There are two
primary assumptions made in magnetic circuit analysis (Paul
et al., 1998). First, it is assumed that the permeability of the
structure is very large (m  m0). Second, since m  m0, it is
further assumed that all of the magnetic ﬁeld lines ﬂow along
the magnetic core and do not deviate outside of the structure;
that is, it is assumed there is no ﬂux leakage out of the toroid in
Figure 1.12(A). Applying Ampe`re’s law of equation 1.29 gives:
