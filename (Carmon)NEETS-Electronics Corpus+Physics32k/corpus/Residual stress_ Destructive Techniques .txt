Destructive techniques result in large and irreparable structural change to the specimen, meaning that either the specimen cannot be returned to service or a mock-up or spare must be used. These techniques function using a "strain release" principle; cutting the measurement specimen to relax the residual stresses and then measuring the deformed shape. As these deformations are usually elastic, there is an exploitable linear relationship between the magnitude of the deformation and magnitude of the released residual stress. Destructive techniques include:
Contour Method – measures the residual stress on a 2D plane section through a specimen, in a uniaxial direction normal to a surface cut through the specimen with wire EDM.
Slitting (Crack Compliance)  – measures residual stress through the thickness of a specimen, at a normal to a cut "slit".
