Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences. They can be used to represent any quantity that has both a magnitude and direction, such as velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0, 5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive y axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as displacement, acceleration, momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field.
Tensors also have extensive applications in physics:
Electromagnetic tensor (or Faraday's tensor) in electromagnetism
Finite deformation tensors for describing deformations and strain tensor for strain in continuum mechanics
Permittivity and electric susceptibility are tensors in anisotropic media
Stressâ€“energy tensor in general relativity, used to represent momentum fluxes
Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum angular momentum operator in spherical coordinates
Diffusion tensors, the basis of diffusion tensor imaging, represent rates of diffusion in biologic environments
