The easiest example is the difference between net distance and total distance. For example, in walking from Point A to Point B along a straight line, one covers a net distance B − A that is equal to the total distance. If one then returns to Point A, however, net distance is now 0 while total distance covered is 2*(B − A). This example captures the essential idea behind the inexact differential in one dimension.
Precisely, the differential of net distance is simply the exact one form

{\displaystyle {\text{d}}f=1\,{\text{d}}x}
with corresponding function

{\displaystyle \Delta f=x_{\text{B}}-x_{\text{A}}}
. It is exact because 1 has antiderivative x everywhere on the real line. On the other hand, the differential of total distance is the inexact one form

{\displaystyle \delta g=\operatorname {sgn} ({\text{d}}x){\text{d}}x}
(i.e. the sign function). It is inexact because sgn(x) has antiderivative |x| which is not differentiable at x = 0. Therefore

{\displaystyle \Delta g\neq x_{\text{B}}-x_{\text{A}}}
and instead we must look at the path dependence. In our example, in the first leg of the journey, sgn(dx) is 1 since x is increasing. In the second leg, sgn(dx) is −1 since x is decreasing. We can then evaluate the total distance as:
