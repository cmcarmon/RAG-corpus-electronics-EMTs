Now B (A) = 1 · 1
8 = 1.75. We can reach the entropy limit! The simple binary
code is, in this case, less eﬃcient than the unequal-length code. Using the eﬃcient code, we can
transmit the symbolic-valued signal having this alphabet 12.5% faster. Furthermore, we know that
no more eﬃcient codebook can be found because of Shannon’s Theorem.
