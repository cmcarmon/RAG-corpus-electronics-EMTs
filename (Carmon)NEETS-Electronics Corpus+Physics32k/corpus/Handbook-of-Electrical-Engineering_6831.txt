Note that this detector works on the principle that the signal will correlate well with itself, yielding a large
value of (73.5) when present, whereas the random noise will tend to average out in the sum (73.5), yielding a
relatively small value when the signal is absent. This detector is illustrated in Fig. 73.1.
