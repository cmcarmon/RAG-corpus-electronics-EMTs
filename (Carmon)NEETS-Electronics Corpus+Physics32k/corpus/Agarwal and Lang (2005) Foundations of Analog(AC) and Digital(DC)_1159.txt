where AD is called the difference-mode gain and AC is called the common-mode gain.
The key in using a difference amplifier is to encode the useful signal in the difference-
mode component and the noise in the common-mode component. Then if we make
AD large and AC small, we achieve our goal of noise reduction. Usually we use the
common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) to describe the ability of the amplifier to reject
the common-mode noise:
