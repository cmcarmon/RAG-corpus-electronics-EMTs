In the absence of gravity, propellant transfer is somewhat more difficult, since liquids can float away from the inlet.
As part of the Orbital Express mission in 2007, hydrazine propellant was successfully transferred between two single-purpose designed technology demonstration spacecraft. The Boeing servicing spacecraft ASTRO transferred propellant to the Ball Aerospace serviceable client spacecraft NEXTSat. Since no crew were present on either spacecraft, this was reported as the first autonomous spacecraft-to-spacecraft fluid transfer.
