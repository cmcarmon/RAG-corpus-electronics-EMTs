The value for the Earth is called the geocentric gravitational constant and equals (3.986004418±0.000000008)×1014 m3 s−2. The uncertainty is just 1 to 500000000 because this quantity is derived from the movement of artificial satellites, which basically involves observations of the distances from the satellite to earth stations at different times, which can be obtained to high accuracy using radar or laser ranging.
However, the M (mass of the Earth in kilograms) can be found out only by dividing the MG by G, and the G is known only by laboratory measures of the attraction between two known masses. The uncertainty of those measures is 1 to 7000, so M will have the same uncertainty.
The value for the Sun is called the heliocentric gravitational constant or geopotential of the Sun and equals (1.32712440042±0.0000000001)×1020 m3 s−2. The uncertainty in the HGC is smaller than the uncertainty in the GGC because the HGC is derived from the ranging of interplanetary probes, and the absolute error of the distance measures to them is about the same as the earth satellite ranging measures, while the absolute distances involved are much bigger.
Note that the reduced mass is also denoted by μ.
