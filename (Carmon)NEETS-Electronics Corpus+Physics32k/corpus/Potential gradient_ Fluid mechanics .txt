In fluid mechanics, the velocity field v describes the fluid motion. An irrotational flow means the velocity field is conservative, or equivalently the vorticity pseudovector field ω is zero:





ω

=
∇
×

v

=

0

.


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\omega }}=\nabla \times \mathbf {v} ={\boldsymbol {0}}.}

This allows the velocity potential to be defined simply as:





v

=
∇
ϕ


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} =\nabla \phi }
