region and is also known as the saturated region. It is called the active region because when the JFET is to be
used as an ampliÔ¨Åer, it should be biased and operated in this region. The saturated value of drain current up
in the active region for the case of  VGS = 0 is called the drain saturation current,  IDSS (the third subscript S
