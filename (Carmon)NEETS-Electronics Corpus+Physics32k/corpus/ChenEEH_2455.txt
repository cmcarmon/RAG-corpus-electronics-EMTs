If there are N number of loops in the form of a coil instead of a
single loop shown in Figure 6.15, then the corresponding ﬁeld
quantities would have to be multiplied by N. One may view the
far-ﬁeld of a small loop antenna as dual to that of a small dipole
antenna. This is because the loop antenna has Hu and Ef far-ﬁeld
components, as shown in equations 6.177 and 6.178, in contrast
to which a small dipole antenna has Eu and Hf components.
Both the small loop and the small dipole antennas have the same
sin u ﬁeld pattern,
thus having the same directive gain
Dg (u, f) ¼ 1:5 sin2 u and directivity D ¼ 1:5. Once the radi-
ation ﬁelds are known, using a procedure similar to that used for
a small dipole antenna in Section 6.7.1, one can derive the total
radiated power, Prad, and the radiation resistance, Rrad.
