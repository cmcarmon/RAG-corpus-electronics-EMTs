Beamforming
Beamforming is a process in which outputs from the hydrophone sensors of an array are coherently combined
by delaying and summing the outputs to provide enhanced detection and estimation. In underwater applica-
tions, one is trying to detect a directional (single direction) signal in the presence of normalized background
noise that is ideally isotropic (nondirectional). By arranging the hydrophone (array) sensors in different physical
geometries and electronically steering them in a particular direction, one can increase the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR)  in  a  given  direction  by  rejecting  or  canceling  the  noise  in  other  directions.  There  are  many  different
kinds of arrays (e.g., equally spaced line, continuous line, circular, cylindrical, spherical, or random sonobuoy
arrays). The beam pattern speciÔ¨Åes the response of these arrays to the variation in direction. In the simplest
case, the increase in SNR due to the beamformer, called the array gain (in dB), is given by
