Magnets or magnetic devices are used for thousands of different jobs. One of the most useful and
widely employed applications of magnets is in the production of vast quantities of electric power from
mechanical sources. The mechanical power may be provided by a number of different sources, such as
gasoline or diesel engines, and water or steam turbines. However, the final conversion of these source
energies to electricity is done by generators employing the principle of electromagnetic induction. These
generators, of many types and sizes, are discussed in other modules in this series. The important subject to
be discussed here is the fundamental operating principle of ALL such electromagnetic-induction
generators.
