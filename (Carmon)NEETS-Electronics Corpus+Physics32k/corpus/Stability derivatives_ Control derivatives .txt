Deflection of control surfaces modifies the pressure distribution over the vehicle, and these are dealt with by including perturbations in forces and moments due to control deflection. The fin deflection is normally denoted

{\displaystyle \zeta }
(zeta). Including these terms, the equations of motion become:

Including the control derivatives enables the response of the vehicle to be studied, and the equations of motion used to design the autopilot.
