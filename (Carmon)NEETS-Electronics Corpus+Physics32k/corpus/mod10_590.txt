Most practical transmitting antennas are divided into two basic classifications, HERTZ (half-wave) 
ANTENNAS and MARCONI (quarter-wave) ANTENNAS. Hertz antennas are generally installed some 
distance above the ground and are positioned to radiate either vertically or horizontally. Marconi antennas 
operate with one end grounded and are mounted perpendicular to the Earth or to a surface acting as a 
ground. Hertz antennas are generally used for frequencies above 2 megahertz. Marconi antennas are used 
for frequencies below 2 megahertz and may be used at higher frequencies in certain applications.
