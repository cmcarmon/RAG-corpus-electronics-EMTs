applications. Since Ti } Eg the transition to the intrinsic region can be delayed by using widegap semiconductors.
Both silicon carbide (several types of SiC with different lattice structures are available with Eg = 2.2–2.86 eV)
and  diamond  (Eg =  5.5  eV)  have  been  used  to  fabricate  diodes  and  transistors  operating  in  the  300–700(cid:176)C
temperature range.
