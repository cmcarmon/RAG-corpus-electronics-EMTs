Manually exploring alternative custom memory organizations
is infeasible, as discussed. Tool support is imperative for any
application that is of realistic size. We have developed such
tools such as the BTPC application and the cavity detector, and
applied them to several realistic examples. The combination of
the SCBD and MAA steps yields the Pareto curves for the
BPTC demonstrator discussed in Section 2.5.
