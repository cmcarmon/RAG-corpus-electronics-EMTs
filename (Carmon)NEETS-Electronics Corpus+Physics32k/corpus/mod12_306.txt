Phase modulation is also similar to frequency modulation in the number of sidebands that exist
within the modulated wave and the spacing between sidebands. Phase modulation will also produce an
infinite number of sideband frequencies. The spacing between these sidebands will be equal to the
frequency of the modulating signal. However, one factor is very different in phase modulation; that is, the
distribution of power in pm sidebands is not similar to that in fm sidebands, as will be explained in the
next section.
