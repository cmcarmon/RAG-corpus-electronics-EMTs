This  is  the  conservation  law  for  electric  charge  and  current  densities.  Regarding  (35.5)  as  a  fundamental
equation, we can use it to derive (35.4) by taking the divergence of (35.2). Equation (35.3) can also be derived
–
r–
·  (
,t
) is a constant independent
by taking the divergence of (35.1) which gives 
B
of time. Such a constant, if not zero, then implies the existence of magnetic monopoles similar to free electric
charges. Since magnetic monopoles have not been found to exist, this constant must be zero and we arrive at
(35.3).
