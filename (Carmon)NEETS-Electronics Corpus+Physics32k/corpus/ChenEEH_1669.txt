Spatial Versus Compressed Domain Processing
Given the huge storage requirements of nontextual data, the
vast volumes of images are normally stored in compressed
form. One approach in CBIR systems is to Ô¨Årst decompress
the images and transform them into the format used by the
system. The default color format used by majority of the CBIR
systems is RGB, which is very redundant and unsuitable for
storage but very easy to process and use for display. Once the
raw image data has been extracted after decompression, any of
the content modeling techniques can be applied to yield a
representation of the image content for indexing. This process
of decompressing the image before content representation
