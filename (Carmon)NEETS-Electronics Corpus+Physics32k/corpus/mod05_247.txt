The three-phase alternator, as the name implies, has three single-phase windings spaced such that the
voltage induced in any one phase is displaced by 120ยบ from the other two. A schematic diagram of a
three-phase stator showing all the coils becomes complex, and it is difficult to see what is actually
happening. The simplified schematic of figure 3-8, view A, shows all the windings of each phase lumped
together as one winding. The rotor is omitted for simplicity. The voltage waveforms generated across
each phase are drawn on a graph, phase-displaced 120ยบ  from each other. The three-phase alternator as
shown in this schematic is made up of three single-phase alternators whose generated voltages are out of
phase by 120ยบ . The three phases are independent of each other.
