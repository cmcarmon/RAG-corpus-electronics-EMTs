Data is written as tiny magnetic bits (or spots) on the disk surface. Eight-bit codes are generally used 
to represent data. Each code represents a different number, letter, or special character. In chapter 4, you'll 
learn how the codes are formed. When data is read from the disk, the data on the disk remains unchanged. 
When data is written on the disk, it replaces any data previously stored on the same area of the disk.
