Unlike unanchored axial and universal expansion joints, lateral expansion joints do not load adjacent pipe supports with the axial compressive force from internal pressure since this force is absorbed by the tie rods. Angular expansion joint

The angular expansion joint absorbs bending and angular movement. Like a simple axial expansion joint, it consists of a metal bellows and connectors on both sides. It also features
A hinged anchoring of these connectors for angular movements in a single plane, or
A gimbal-mounted anchoring for angular movements in all planes
Thus, the anchoring determines the type of movement absorption.
