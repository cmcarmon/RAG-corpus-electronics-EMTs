Once we have ﬁnished typing all the necessary SPICE commands, we need to ”save” them to
a ﬁle on the computer’s hard disk so that SPICE has something to reference to when invoked.
Since this is my ﬁrst SPICE netlist, I’ll save it under the ﬁlename ”circuit1.cir” (the actual
name being arbitrary). You may elect to name your ﬁrst SPICE netlist something completely
different, just as long as you don’t violate any ﬁlename rules for your operating system, such
as using no more than 8+3 characters (eight characters in the name, and three characters in
the extension: 12345678.123) in DOS.
