The Kelvin measurement can be a practical tool for ﬁnding poor connections or unexpected
resistance in an electrical circuit. Connect a DC power supply to the circuit and adjust the
power supply so that it supplies a constant current to the circuit as shown in the diagram
above (within the circuit’s capabilities, of course). With a digital multimeter set to measure
DC voltage, measure the voltage drop across various points in the circuit. If you know the wire
size, you can estimate the voltage drop you should see and compare this to the voltage drop
you measure. This can be a quick and effective method of ﬁnding poor connections in wiring
exposed to the elements, such as in the lighting circuits of a trailer. It can also work well for
unpowered AC conductors (make sure the AC power cannot be turned on). For example, you
can measure the voltage drop across a light switch and determine if the wiring connections to
the switch or the switch’s contacts are suspect. To be most effective using this technique, you
should also measure the same type of circuits after they are newly made so you have a feel for
the ”correct” values. If you use this technique on new circuits and put the results in a log book,
you have valuable information for troubleshooting in the future.
