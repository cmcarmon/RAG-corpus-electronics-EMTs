Often, the switching law will employ a hysteresis to prevent
chattering (fast switching) if the scheduling parameter evolves
near a switching boundary. The hysteresis simply delays the
switch to new controller parameters until the parameter has
moved beyond a boundary layer encompassing the switching
boundary, as illustrated in Figure 9.1.
