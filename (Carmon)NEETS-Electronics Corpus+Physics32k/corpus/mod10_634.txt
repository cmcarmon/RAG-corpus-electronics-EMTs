As you can see from the figure, the lines used to plot the point form a rectangle. For this reason, this 
type of plot is called a rectangular-coordinate graph. A new rectangle is formed for each different point 
plotted. In this example, the points plotted lie in a straight line extending from 7 units on the vertical scale 
to the projection of position 7 on the horizontal scale. This is the characteristic pattern in rectangular 
coordinates of an isotropic source of radiation.
