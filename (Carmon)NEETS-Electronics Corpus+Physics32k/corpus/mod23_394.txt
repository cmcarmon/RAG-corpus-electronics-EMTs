â€¢ DO always ship floppy disks in appropriate shipping containers. When shipping only a few disks, 
use the specially designed cardboard shipping envelopes. If you must ship a large number of 
disks, make sure the box you use is sturdy enough to protect the disks from damage. A good rule 
of thumb is to use a shipping box that allows you to place 2 inches of packing material around the 
disks.
