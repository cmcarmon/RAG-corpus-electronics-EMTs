For LC impedances or admittances, we stated the rules that the
function is represented by the ratio of an even and odd poly-
nomial and the poles and zeros must interchange, be simple,
and have positive residues. To ﬁnd the partial fractions, we
must use a root-ﬁnding routine and actually get the zeros and
poles ﬁrst. To calculate the residues of the poles, we use the
following formulas:
