in which a and b are the attenuation and phase constants of the
resonator line, and np and ng are the phase and group velocities,
respectively (Konishi, 1991). As for the TEM-mode transmis-
sion line resonators, the condition of np ¼ ng is always valid.
The resonant characteristics of an arbitrarily shaped planar
patch resonator can be obtained by applying a ﬁeld modeling
technique (two-dimensional problem). For a regularly shaped
resonator, such as the circular disk or radial resonator shown in
Figure 7.28(A), the resonant frequencies can be approximately
calculated by simple closed-form formulas. TMnm0 modes are
