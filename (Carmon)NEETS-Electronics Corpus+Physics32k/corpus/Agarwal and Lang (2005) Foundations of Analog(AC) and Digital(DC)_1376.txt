Finally, it may seem that the solution to such a simple problem canâ€™t pos-
sibly be as involved as this appears Correct. This problem and most first-order
systems with step excitation can be solved by inspection (see Section 10.3).
But here we are trying to establish general methods, and have chosen the
simplest example to illustrate the method.
