the T
n denote the two triangles associated with the nth edge,
A
n are the areas of triangles T
n , ‘n is the length of the nth
edge, and r
n are the vectors deﬁned in Figure 8.7(A). The
vector plot of f n(r) is illustrated in Figure 8.7(B). The most
important feature of this basis function is that its normal
component to edge ‘n is a constant (normalized to 1), whereas
the normal components to other edges are zero. This feature
guarantees the continuity of current ﬂow over all edges, as in
the case of the rooftop functions.
