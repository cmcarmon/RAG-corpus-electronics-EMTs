Another way to reduce the effects of armature reaction is to place small auxiliary poles called 
"interpoles" between the main field poles. The interpoles have a few turns of large wire and are connected 
in series with the armature. Interpoles are wound and placed so that each interpole has the same magnetic 
polarity as the main pole ahead of it, in the direction of rotation. The field generated by the interpoles 
produces the same effect as the compensating winding. This field, in effect, cancels the armature reaction 
for all values of load current by causing a shift in the neutral plane opposite to the shift caused by 
armature reaction. The amount of shift caused by the interpoles will equal the shift caused by armature 
reaction since both shifts are a result of armature current.
