All rf attenuators, decade or step attenuators, decade resistors, and 50/75-ohm loads are clearly
marked to show their attenuation factor or resistance. In the case of precision rf attenuators, they are
usually marked to show their useful frequency ranges. They are all basically resistive devices and are
