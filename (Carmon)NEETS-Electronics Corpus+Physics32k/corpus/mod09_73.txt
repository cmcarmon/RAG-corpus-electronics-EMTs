Each LC circuit responds differently to different input frequencies. In the following paragraphs, we 
will analyze what happens internally in a series-LC circuit when frequencies at resonance, below 
resonance, and above resonance are applied. The L and C values in the circuit are those used in the 
problem just studied under resonant-frequency. The frequencies applied are the three inputs from figure 
1-6. Note that the resonant frequency of each of these components is 205 kHz, as figured in the problem.
