4. A practical, nonideal inductor has a signiÔ¨Åcant resistive component,
as  shown  in  Fig.  6.26.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  inductor  is
made  of  a  conducting  material  such  as  copper,  which  has  some
resistance. This resistance is called the winding resistance
, and
it  appears  in  series  with  the  inductance  of  the  inductor. The  pres-
makes it both an energy storage device and an energy
ence of 
dissipation device. Since 
is usually very small, it is ignored in
most cases. The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance

Cw
is very small and can be ignored in most cases, except at high fre-
quencies. We will assume ideal inductors in this book.
