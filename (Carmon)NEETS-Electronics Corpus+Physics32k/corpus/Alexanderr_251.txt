Notice  that  the  gain  is  the  feedback  resistance  divided  by  the
input  resistance  which  means  that  the  gain  depends  only  on  the
external elements connected to the op amp. In view of Eq. (5.9), an
equivalent  circuit  for  the  inverting  ampliﬁer  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.11.
The inverting ampliﬁer is used, for example, in a current-to-voltage
converter.
