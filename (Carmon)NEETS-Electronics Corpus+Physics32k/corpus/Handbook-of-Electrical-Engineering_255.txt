So we see that a physical signal is either the real (cosine) or the imaginary (sine) component of an abstract,
complex mathematical signal. The additional mathematics required for treatment of complex numbers allows
us to associate a phasor, or complex amplitude, with a sinusoidal signal. The time-invariant phasor associated
with v(t) is the quantity
