Power Distribution
Present-day VLSI ASICs consume considerable power, unless speciÔ¨Åcally designed for battery-operated, low-
power  portable  electronics  [Chandrakasan  and  Broderson,  1995].  A  40-W  IC  operating  at  3.3 V  requires  a
current of 12 A, with currents increasing in future generations of high-power VLSI (due not only to the higher
power dissipation but also to lower Vdd).
