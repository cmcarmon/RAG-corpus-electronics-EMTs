Having considered the situation when a capacitor is 
being  charged,  let’s  consider  what  happens  when 
an already charged capacitor is discharged.  
  When the fully charged capacitor from Fig. 3.24 
is  connected  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.30,  the  capacitor 
will  discharge 
the 
capacitor  voltage,  vC, will  fall  exponentially  with 
time, as shown in Fig. 3.31.  
  The  current  in  the  circuit,  i, will  also  fall,  as 
shown in  Fig. 3.32. The rate of discharge (i.e. the 
rate of decay of voltage with time) will once again 
be governed by the time constant of the circuit, C ×
R. 
  The  voltage  developed  across  the  discharging 
capacitor,  vC, varies  with  time,  t, according  to  the 
relationship:
