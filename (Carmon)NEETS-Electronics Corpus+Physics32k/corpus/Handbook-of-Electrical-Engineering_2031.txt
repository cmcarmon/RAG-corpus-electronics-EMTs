Spatial Processing
In spatial processing, audio signals are modiﬁed to give them new spatial attributes, such as, for example, the
perception of having been recorded in a speciﬁc concert hall. The auditory system—using only the two ears as
inputs—is capable of perceiving the direction and distance of a sound source with a high degree of accuracy,
  spectral  cues.  Wave  propagation  in  the  ear  canal  is  essentially  one-
by  exploiting 
dimensional. Hence, the 3-D spatial information is coded by sound diffraction into spectral information before
the sound enters the ear canal. The sound diffraction is caused by the head/torso (on the order of 20-dB and
m
 level difference and delay, respectively) and at the two pinnae (auriculae); see, for example,

Shaw [1980]. Binaural techniques like the one discussed below can be used for evaluating room and concert-
hall acoustics (optionally in reduced-scale model rooms using a miniature dummy head), for noise assessment
(e.g., in cars), and for “Kunstkopfstereophonie” (dummy-head stereophony). In addition, there are techniques
 (like “Q-Sound”) that try to extend the range in horizontal angle of traditional
for 
stereo  speakers  by  using  interaural  cross  cancellation.  Largely  an  open  question  is  how  to  reproduce  spatial
information for large audiences, for example, in movie theaters.
