materials such as glass and rubber offer great 
 opposition to current flow. Other materials such 
as silver and copper offer little opposition to current 
flow. This chapter examines the characteristics of resisâ€‘
tance, types of resistance, and the effects of connecting 
 resistors together by a conductor to form a circuit.
