The  measurement  of  a  large  number  of  parameters  requires  extensive  and  bulky  equipment,  unless  the
parameters can be combined in groups of similar inputs to minimize the signal conditioning required. This
fact generally dictates a relatively standard transducer rather than an optimum one for each particular mea-
surement.
