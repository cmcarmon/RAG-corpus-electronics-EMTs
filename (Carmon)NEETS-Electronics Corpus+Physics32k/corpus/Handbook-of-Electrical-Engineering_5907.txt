Mathematical/Circuit Model
The  (no-load)  terminal  voltage  Vt  of  a  dc  generator  depends  on  several  factors.  First,  it  depends  on  the
construction of the machine (e.g., the number of conductors). Second, the voltage magnitude depends on the
magnetic ﬁeld of the stator: the stronger the ﬁeld is, the higher the voltage becomes. Third, since the induced
emf is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux (Faraday’s law), the terminals have higher voltage
with a higher machine speed. One can write
