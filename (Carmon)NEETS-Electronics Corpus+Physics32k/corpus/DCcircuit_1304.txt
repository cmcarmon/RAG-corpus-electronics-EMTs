Detailed experiments showed that the magnetic ﬁeld produced by an electric current is
always oriented perpendicular to the direction of ﬂow. A simple method of showing this rela-
tionship is called the left-hand rule. Simply stated, the left-hand rule says that the magnetic
ﬂux lines produced by a current-carrying wire will be oriented the same direction as the curled
ﬁngers of a person’s left hand (in the ”hitchhiking” position), with the thumb pointing in the
direction of electron ﬂow:
