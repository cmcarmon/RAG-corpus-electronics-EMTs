linearity
.
  of  a  D/A  circuit  is  the  smallest  change  in  the  output  analog  signal.  In  an A/D  system,  the
resolution is the smallest change in voltage that can be detected by the system and that can produce a change
, that will
in the digital code. The resolution determines the total number of digital codes, or 
be recognized or produced by the circuit.
