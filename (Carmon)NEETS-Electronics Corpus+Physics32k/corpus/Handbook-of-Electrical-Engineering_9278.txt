Calculating post-release defect removal efﬁciency requires an accurate quality measurement system through-
out the life cycle. In addition, rules for counting post-release defects must be established. For example, if the
same  bug  is  reported  more  than  once  by  different  users,  it  should  still  count  as  only  a  single  bug.  If  upon
investigation user bug reports should turn out to be usage errors, hardware errors, or errors against some other
software package, such bug reports should not be considered in calculating defect removal efﬁciency rates. If
bugs are found by project personnel, rather than users, after release to customers, those bugs should still be
considered to be in the post-release category.
