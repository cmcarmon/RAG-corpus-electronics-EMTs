Fault 6 
 
No collector current flows when the collector-base 
junction  is  open-circuit  and,  as  with  fault  2,  the 
collector  voltage  rises  towards  the  supply.  Note 
that,  since  the  base-emitter  junction  is  intact,  the 
normal  forward  bias  of  0.6  V  is  present  and  this 
condition  distinguishes 
that 
described in Fault 2.
