Consider a material body, solid or fluid, that is flowing and/or moving in space. Let v be the velocity field within the body; that is, a smooth function from ℝ3 × ℝ such that v(p,t) is the macroscopic velocity of the material that is passing through the point p at time t.
The velocity v(p + r,t) at a point displaced from p by a small vector r can be written as a Taylor series:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {p} +\mathbf {r} ,t)=\mathbf {v} (\mathbf {p} ,t)+(\nabla \mathbf {v} )(\mathbf {p} ,t)(\mathbf {r} )+{\text{higher order terms}},}

where ∇v the gradient of the velocity field, understood as a linear map that takes a displacement vector r to the corresponding change in the velocity.

In an arbitrary reference frame, ∇v is related to the Jacobian matrix of the field, namely in 3 dimensions it is the 3 × 3 matrix

where vi is the component of v parallel to axis i and ∂jf denotes the partial derivative of a function f with respect to the space coordinate xj. Note that J is a function of p and t.
