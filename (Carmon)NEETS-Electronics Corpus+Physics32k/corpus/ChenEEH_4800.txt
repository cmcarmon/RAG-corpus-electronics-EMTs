To be more realistic, both a sensor noise and an actuator
noise have been added to the state measurements and the
action network output. Speciﬁcally, the actuator noise has
been implemented through u(t) ¼ u(t) þ r, where r is a uni-
formly distributed random variable. For the sensor noise, both
uniform and Gaussian random variables were added to the
angle measurements u. The uniform state sensor noise was
implemented through u ¼ (1 þ noise percentage)  u. Gaus-
sian sensor noise was zero mean with speciﬁed variance.
