Developed in the 1950s, steam catapults have proven exceptionally reliable. Carriers equipped with four steam catapults have been able to use at least one of them 99.5 percent of the time. However, there are a number of drawbacks. One group of Navy engineers wrote, "The foremost deficiency is that the catapult operates without feedback control. With no feedback, there often occurs large transients in tow force that can damage or reduce the life of the airframe." The steam system is massive, inefficient (4â€“6%), and hard to control. These control problems allow Nimitz-class steam-powered catapults to launch heavy aircraft, but not aircraft as light as many UAVs.
A somewhat similar system to EMALS, Westinghouse's electropult, was developed in 1946 but not deployed.
