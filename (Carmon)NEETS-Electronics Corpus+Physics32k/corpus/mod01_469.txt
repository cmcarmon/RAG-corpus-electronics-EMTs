Previously, it was shown that voltage is an electrical force, and that voltage forces current to flow in
a closed circuit. However, when voltage exists but current does not flow because the circuit is open, no
work is done. This is similar to the spring under tension that produced no motion. When voltage causes
electrons to move, work is done. The instantaneous RATE at which this work is done is called the electric
power rate, and is measured in WATTS.
