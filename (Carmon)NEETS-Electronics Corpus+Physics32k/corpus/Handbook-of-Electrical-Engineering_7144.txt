Equation (74.16) applies to a “bent pipe” satellite. If on-board signal regeneration is used for digital trans-
mission, the uplink signal is demodulated and a clean set of baseband bits is remodulated. This has the effect
of separating the accumulation of uplink and downlink noise contributions by causing the uplink noise to be
effectively modulated onto the downlink carrier with the desired signal [Gagliardi, 1991]. In that case, only the
uplink or the downlink term in the denominator of Eq. (74.16) would be used as appropriate. Remodulation
is also useful for intersatellite links. In each case, a savings in power or antenna size may be obtained at the
expense of circuit and processing complexity.
