The amplitude of the sawtooth that is produced is limited by the value of VCC that is used in the 
circuit. For example, if the voltage is 30 volts, and the capacitor (C2) is allowed to charge to 10 percent of 
30 volts, then the amplitude of the sawtooth will be 3 volts (see figure 3-41, view (B)). If VCC is increased 
to 40 volts, C2 will charge to 10 percent of 40 volts and the output will increase in amplitude to 4 volts. 
Changing the value of V CC in the circuit changes the amplitude of the sawtooth waveform that is 
produced; amplitude determines the physical length. Since the number of time constants used in the 
circuit has not been changed, linearity does not change with a change in VCC.
