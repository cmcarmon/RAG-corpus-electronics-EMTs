Cold-rolled,  grain-oriented  silicon  steel  laminations  are  exclusively  used  in  large  power  transformers  to
reduce core losses. A typical silicon steel used in transformers contains 95% iron, 3% silicon, 1% manganese,
0.2% phosphor, 0.06% carbon, 0.025% sulphur, and traces of other impurities.
