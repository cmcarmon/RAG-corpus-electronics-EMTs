Notice that the stator of the resolver is a cylindrical structure of slotted laminations on which two
coils are wound. The rotor is composed of a shaft, laminations, two windings, and four slip rings.
Compensator components, which improve the angular accuracy of resolvers, may consist of resistors or
additional windings in the stator and rotor winding circuits. Compensator windings, which increase the
accuracy of the resolver, are located inside the stator. Compensating (calibrating) resistors, which
