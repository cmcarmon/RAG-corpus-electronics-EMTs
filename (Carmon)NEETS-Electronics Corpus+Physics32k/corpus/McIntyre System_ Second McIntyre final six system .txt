This adaptation of the first McIntyre System corrected for the anomaly that, in the first week, the team who finished 4th would have a more difficult opponent than the team who finished 5th, and was hence more likely to be eliminated, despite finishing higher. This was achieved by adding flexibility to the second round draw, so that the two elimination final winners were re-ranked to determine which played the winner of the qualifying final and which played the loser.
However, both McIntyre final six systems had another weakness: the loser of the Qualifying Final (which is the most difficult game of the first round), ended up facing elimination in the First-Semi Final, while the higher-ranked Elimination Final winner (who has had the easiest game of the first round) has a double chance in the Second-Semi Final.
