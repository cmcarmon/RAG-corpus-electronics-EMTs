The complete circuitry for Q2 is not shown in this figure, as the main concern is the
signal-developing resistor (R5) for Q2. The coupling capacitor (C2) and the resistor (R5) limit the
low-frequency response of the amplifier and cause a phase shift. The amount of the phase shift will
depend upon the amount of resistance and capacitance. The RC network of R4 and C3 compensates for
the effects of C2 and R5 and extends the low-frequency response of the amplifier.
