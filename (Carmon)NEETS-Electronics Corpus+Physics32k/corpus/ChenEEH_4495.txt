A 3DOF, single-bay structure with an active tendon controller
as shown in Figure 5.4 is considered here. The structure is
subject to a one-dimensional earthquake excitation. If a simple
shear frame model for the structure is assumed, the governing
equations of motion in state space form can be written as:
