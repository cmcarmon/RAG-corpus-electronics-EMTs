Most ohmmeters of the design shown in the previous section utilize a battery of relatively low
voltage, usually nine volts or less. This is perfectly adequate for measuring resistances under
several mega-ohms (MΩ), but when extremely high resistances need to be measured, a 9 volt
battery is insufﬁcient for generating enough current to actuate an electromechanical meter
movement.
