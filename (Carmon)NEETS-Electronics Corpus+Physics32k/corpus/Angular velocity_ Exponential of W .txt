If we know an initial frame A(0) and we are given a constant angular velocity tensor W, we can obtain A(t) for any given t. Since






d
A
(
t
)


d
t



=
W
⋅
A
(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\frac {dA(t)}{dt}}=W\cdot A(t)}
, this can be read as a differential equation that defines A(t) knowing W(t):







d
A
(
t
)

A


=
W
⋅

d
t

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {dA(t)}{A}}=W\cdot {dt}.}

And if the angular speed is constant, then W is also constant and the equation can be integrated. The result is:




A
(
t
)
=

e

W
⋅
t


A
(
0
)
,


{\displaystyle A(t)=e^{W\cdot t}A(0),}

which shows a connection with the Lie group of rotations.
