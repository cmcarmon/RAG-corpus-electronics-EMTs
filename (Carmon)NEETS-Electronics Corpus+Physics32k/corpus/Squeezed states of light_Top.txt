In quantum physics, light is in a squeezed state , if its electric field strength Ԑ for some phases



ϑ


{\displaystyle \vartheta }
has a quantum uncertainty smaller than that of a coherent state. The term squeezing thus refers to a reduced quantum uncertainty. To obey Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, a squeezed state must also have phases at which the electric field uncertainty is anti-squeezed, i.e. larger than that of a coherent state.
