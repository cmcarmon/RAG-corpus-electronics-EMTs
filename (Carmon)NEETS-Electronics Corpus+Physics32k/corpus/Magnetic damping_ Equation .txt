The differential equation of motion of a magnet dropped vertically through or near a conductor, where "M" is the mass of the magnet, "K" is the damping coefficient, "v" is the velocity, "g" is gravity and "a" is the acceleration of the magnet:

As gravitational pull increases, the magnet's acceleration as it falls will tend to increase, except to the extent that the damping coefficient the magnet is experiencing (as a result of the conductor) increases, combined with the extent that the velocity of the magnet also increases – a magnet moving or falling quickly will have its acceleration (i.e., its increase in speed as it falls) reduced more than one moving or falling more slowly, and this effect on acceleration will be even more pronounced if the damping coefficient of the conductor is high.
