When you look at logic circuit diagrams for digital equipment, you are not going to see just a single
gate, but many combinations of gates. At first it may seem confusing and complex. If you interpret one
gate at a time, you can work your way through any network. In this section, we will analyze several
combinations of gates and then provide you with some practice problems.
