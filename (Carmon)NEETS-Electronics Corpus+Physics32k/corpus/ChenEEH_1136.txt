MEMS and optical signals have a natural synergism. Many
small mirrors for redirecting light beams and ﬁne-scale diffrac-
tion gratings that can be dynamically reconﬁgured to analyze
optical spectra have been demonstrated and are being manu-
factured. Micromechanisms with dimensions from a few to a
few hundred micrometers are small enough to be moved easily
by microactuators and large enough to manipulate small
beams of light. In most cases of commercial
interest, the
actuation is accomplished by application of electrostatic forces
to nearby parts in the MEMS device.
