In a conductive fluid, such as a plasma, there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity






v

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
in a magnetic field






B
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {B}}}
. The relative motion induces an electric field






E

{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}
which exerts electric force on the charged particles giving rise to an electric current






J

{\displaystyle {\vec {J}}}
. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a number density

{\displaystyle n_{e}}
, is written as

where

{\displaystyle \nu }
is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field







v

i




{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{i}}
. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write
