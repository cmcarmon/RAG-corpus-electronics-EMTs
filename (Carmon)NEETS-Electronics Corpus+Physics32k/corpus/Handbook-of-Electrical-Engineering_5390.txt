Design Considerations of a TPV System
Figure 60.18  is  a  cross-sectional  drawing  of  a  proto-
type  TPV  unit  under  development  by  McDermott
Technologies for use as a portable power source and
battery  charger  [6].  One  of  the  major  advantages  of
TPV is the wide variety of fuels that can be selected
for  powering  the  system.  This  system  will  use  diesel
fuel, greatly simplifying logistics for the planned use
by the Army. The combination of burner, radiator, gas
ﬂow channels, and emitter is designed to optimize the
temperature uniformity over the emitter surface and
also to isolate the PV cells from any of the hot com-
bustion  products.  At  a  ﬂame  temperature  of  1700K,
the  TPV  system  can  be  designed  for  very  low  NOx
emission.  The  steady  burn  contributes  to  quiet  and
reliable  operation.  Burner  efﬁciency  is  improved  by
thermal  recuperation.  This  consists  of  a  heat
exchanger  that  recirculates  a  high  percentage  of  the
heat of the combustion products to raise the temper-
ature of the incoming combustion air and fuel. Note
that the exhaust is mixed with the air ﬂowing over the
cooling ﬁns for the PV cells, dropping the ﬁnal outlet
temperature to only 30 to 50°C over ambient.
