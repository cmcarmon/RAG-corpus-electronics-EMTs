Speed, the rate of change of position, or the change of position per unit of time
Acceleration, the rate of change in speed, or the change in speed per unit of time
Power, the rate of doing work, or the amount of energy transferred per unit time
Frequency, the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit of time
Reaction rate, the speed at which chemical reactions occur
Volumetric flow rate, the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit of time; e.g., cubic meters per second
