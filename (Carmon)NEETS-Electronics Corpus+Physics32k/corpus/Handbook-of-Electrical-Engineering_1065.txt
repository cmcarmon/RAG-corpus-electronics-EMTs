The set of all values of u for which the integral of Eq. (14.11b) converges is called the region of convergence,
denoted ROC. Since the transform S(u) is deﬁned only for values of u within the ROC, the path of integration
in Eq. (14.11a) must be deﬁned by s so the entire path lies within the ROC. In some literature this transform
pair is called the bilateral Laplace transform because it is the same result obtained by including both the negative
and positive portions of the time axis in the classical Laplace transform integral. The complex Fourier transform
(bilateral Laplace transform) is not often used in solving practical problems, but its signiﬁcance lies in the fact
that it is the most general form that represents the place where Fourier and Laplace transform concepts merge.
Identifying  this  connection  reinforces  the  observation  that  Fourier  and  Laplace  transform  concepts  share
common properties because they are derived by placing different constraints on the same parent form.
