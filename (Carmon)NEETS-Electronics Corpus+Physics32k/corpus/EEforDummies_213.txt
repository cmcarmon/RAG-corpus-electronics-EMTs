Switching is the making or breaking of one or more electrical connections 
such that the flow of current is either interrupted or redirected from one 
path to another. Switching is performed by components called (you guessed 
it!) switches. When a switch is in the open position, the electrical connec-
tion is broken and you have an open circuit with no current flowing. When a 
switch is in the closed position, an electrical connection is made and current 
flows.
