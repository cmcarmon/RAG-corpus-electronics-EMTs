 
In the case of a reverse biased diode, the P-type 
material is negatively biased relative to the N-type 
material. In this case, the negative potential applied  
to  the  P-type  material  attracts  the  positive  charge 
carriers,  drawing  them  away  from  the  junction.  
Likewise,  the  positive  potential  applied  to  the  N-
type  material  attracts  the  negative  charge  carriers 
away  from  the  junction.  This  leaves  the  junction 
area  depleted;  virtually  no  charge  carriers  exist. 
Therefore,  the junction  area  becomes  an  insulator, 
and  current  flow  is  inhibited.  The  reverse  bias 
potential  may  be

breakdown voltage for which the particular diode is 
rated.  As  in  the  case  of  the  maximum  forward 
current  rating,  the  reverse  breakdown  voltage  is 
specified  by 
reverse 
breakdown  voltage  is  usually  very  much  higher 
than  the  forward  threshold  voltage.  A  typical 
general-purpose diode may be specified as having a 
forward  threshold  voltage  of  0.6  V  and  a  reverse 
breakdown  voltage  of  200  V.  If  the  latter  is 
exceeded,

damage. It is also worth noting that, where diodes 
are  designed  for  use  as  rectifiers,  manufacturers 
often  quote  peak 
inverse  voltage  (PIV) or 
maximum  reverse  repetitive  voltage  (VRRM)
rather than maximum reverse breakdown voltage.
