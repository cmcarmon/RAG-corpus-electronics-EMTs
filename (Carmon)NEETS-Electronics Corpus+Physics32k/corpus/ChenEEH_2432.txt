One can envision literally inﬁnite possible antenna geometries
that can be designed to achieve a variety of performance
features. Among these diverse conﬁgurations, one may identify
a few basic antenna elements that are often used for general-
purpose wireless applications. The following sections analyze
the radiation/reception mechanism in selected basic antenna
geometries: (1) dipole antenna, (2) monopole antenna, (3)
wire-loop antenna, (4) slot antenna, and (5) microstrip an-
tenna. Selected other types of antennas in use will also be
introduced.
