A seismic vibrator transforms the energy provided by a diesel engine into a vibration. It is performed by a shaker, a movable element that generates the vibration thanks to a piston-reaction mass device driven by an electrohydraulic servo valve. The shaker is applied to the ground for each vibration, then raised up so that the seismic vibrator can move to another vibrating point.
Vibrator capability is defined by the maximum force it is capable to generate, called High Peak Force and measured in pound-force. To transmit a maximum force to the ground and prevent the shaker from bumping, part of the weight of the vibrator is applied to the shaker.
