The FRONT-TO-BACK RATIO of an array is the proportion of energy radiated in the principal 
direction of radiation to the energy radiated in the opposite direction. A high front-to-back ratio is 
desirable because this means that a minimum amount of energy is radiated in the undesired direction. 
Since completely suppressing all such radiation is impossible, an infinite ratio cannot be achieved. In 
actual practice, however, rather high values can be attained. Usually the length and spacing of the 
parasitic elements are adjusted so that a maximum front-to-back ratio is obtained, rather than maximum 
gain in the desired direction.
