Therefore, a hierarchical and typically much more power-
hungry intermediate memory organization is needed to match
the central DRAM to the data ordering and bandwidth re-
quirements of the processor data paths. The reduction of the
power consumption in fast random-access memories is not as
advanced as in DRAMs; moreover, this type of memory is
saturating because many circuit and technology level tricks
have already been applied also in SRAMs. As a result, fast
SRAMs keep on consuming on the order of watts for high-
speed operation around 500 MHz. So the memory-related
system power bottleneck remains a very critical
issue for
data-dominated applications.
