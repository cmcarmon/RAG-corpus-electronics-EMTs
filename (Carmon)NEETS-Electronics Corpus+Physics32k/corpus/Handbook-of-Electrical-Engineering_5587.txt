Overcurrent Protection
The simplest fault detector is a sensor that measures the increase in current caused by the fault. The fuse is the
simplest  overcurrent  protection;  in  fact,  it  is  the  complete  protection  chain—sensor,  relay,  and  circuit
breaker—in  one  package.  Fuses  are  used  in  lower-voltage  (distribution)  circuits.  They  are  difﬁcult  to  set  in
high-voltage circuits, where load and fault currents may be of the same order of magnitude. Furthermore, they
must be replaced when blown, which implies a long duration outage. They may also lead to system unbalances.
However, when applicable, they are simple and inexpensive.
