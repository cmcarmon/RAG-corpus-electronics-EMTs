Edward L. Norton: Edward Norton16 was an electrical engineer who worked at Bell Laboratory
from its inception in 1922. In the same month when Mayer’s paper appeared, Norton wrote in an
internal technical memorandum a paragraph describing the current-source equivalent. No evidence
suggests Norton knew of Mayer’s publication.
