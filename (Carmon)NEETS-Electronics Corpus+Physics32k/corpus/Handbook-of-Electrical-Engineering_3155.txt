Resonant-Link Inverters
The use of resonant switching techniques can be applied to inverter topologies to reduce the switching losses
in the power devices. They also permit high switching frequency operation to reduce the size of the magnetic
components  in  the  inverter  unit.  In  the  resonant  dc-link  inverter  shown  in  Fig.  30.15,  a  resonant  circuit  is
added at the inverter input to convert a ﬁxed dc voltage to a pulsating dc voltage. This resonant circuit enables
the  devices  to  be  turned  on  and  turned  off  during  the  zero  voltage  interval.  Zero  voltage  or  zero  current
switching  is  often  termed  soft  switching.  Under  soft  switching,  the  switching  losses  in  the  power  devices  are
almost  eliminated.  The  electromagnetic  interference  (EMI)  problem  is  less  severe  because  resonant  voltage
pulses have lower dv/dt compared to those of hard-switched PWM inverters. Also, the machine insulation is
less stretched because of lower dv/dt resonant voltage pulses. In Fig. 30.15, all the inverter devices are turned
on simultaneously to initiate a resonant cycle. The commutation from one device to another is initiated at the
zero dc-link voltage. The inverter output voltage is formed by the integral numbers of quasi-sinusoidal pulses.
The circuit consisting of devices  Q, D, and the capacitor C acts as an active clamp to limit the dc voltage to
about 1.4 times the diode rectiﬁer voltage Vs.
