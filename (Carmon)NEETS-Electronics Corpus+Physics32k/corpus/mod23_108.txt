Winding errors are another cause of tape failure. They happen when improper winding practices
create an excessive or uneven force as the tape is being wound onto a tape reel. The form taken by the
tape after it is wound onto the reel is called the tape pack. Winding errors can cause a deformed tape pack
that will prevent good head-to-tape contact.
