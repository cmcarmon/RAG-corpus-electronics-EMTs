These simple guidelines may become very useful when per-
forming a real control design. Moreover, notice that the bound
on
i (t) makes it possible to specify the compact sets of
the approximators so that, even throughout the transient, it
can be guaranteed that the states will remain within the com-
pact sets without the need for a global bounding control term.
This has been a recurrent shortcoming of many online func-
tion approximation-based methods, and the explicit bound on
the transient makes it possible to overcome it.
