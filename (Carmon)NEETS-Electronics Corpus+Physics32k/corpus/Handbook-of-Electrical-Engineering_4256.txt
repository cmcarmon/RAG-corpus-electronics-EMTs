reï¬‚ectors  have  achieved  instrumentation  and  S/N  angle  residual  systematic  error  as  low  as  50  mrad.  Phased
array antennas have achieved a random error of less than 60 mrad, but the composite systematic residual errors
remain  to  be  measured.  The  limitations  are  primarily  in  the  tolerance  on  the  phase  and  amplitude  of  the
antenna illumination function.
