The ”S”-shaped curve traced by these steps form what is called the hysteresis curve of a
ferromagnetic material for a given set of ﬁeld intensity extremes (-H and +H). If this doesn’t
quite make sense, consider a hysteresis graph for the automobile steering scenario described
earlier, one graph depicting a ”tight” steering system and one depicting a ”loose” system:
