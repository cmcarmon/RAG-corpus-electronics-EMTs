Dynamic power dissipation is only consumed when there is
switching activity at some nodes in a CMOS circuit. For
example, a chip may contain an enormous amount of capaci-
tive nodes, but if there is no switching in the circuit, then no
dynamic power will be consumed (Chandraksan et al., 1992).
The switching frequency, which is a  f , determines how
often the switching occurs. Normally, f increases with technol-
ogy scaling, but for a given technology, double-edge-triggered
ﬂip-ﬂops may be used to reduce the dynamic power dissipa-
tion of the clock distribution network, which could in turn
result in signiﬁcant savings in the total power dissipation. The
node switching activity per cycle, a has two components:
useful data switching activity (UDSA) and redundant spuri-
ous switching activity (RSSA).
