FIGURE 115.4 A and B represent the averaged power spectra of 80 4-s epochs of REM sleep (sampling rate = 128 Hz)
obtained from hippocampal CA1 and the dentate gyrus, respectively. Note that both spectra exhibit clear power peaks at 7-
Hz (theta) and 14-Hz (beta) frequencies. C and D represent the bispectrum of these same epochs from CA1 and the dentate
gyrus,  respectively.  Computation  of  the  bicoherence  index  at  7 Hz  shows  signiÔ¨Åcant  quadratic  phase  coupling  at  this
frequency, indicating that the 14-Hz peak is not spontaneously generated, but results from quadratic phase coupling.
