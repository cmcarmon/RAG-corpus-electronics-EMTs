Multimedia trafÔ¨Åc streams have high bandwidth requirements
(refer to Table 7.5). The best-effort Internet model does not
provide any mechanism for applications to reserve network
resources to meet such high bandwidth requirements and also
does not prevent anyone from sending data at such high rates.
Uncontrolled transmissions at such high rates can cause heavy
congestion in the network, leading to a congestion collapse
that can completely halt the Internet. There is no mechanism
in the best-effort Internet to prevent this from happening
(except using a brute force technique of disconnecting the
source of such congestion). It is left to the discretion of the
application to dynamically adapt to network congestions. Elas-
tic applications that use TCP utilize a closed-loop feedback
mechanism (built
into TCP) to prevent congestion (this
method of congestion control is called reactive congestion
control). However, most multimedia applications use UDP
for transmitting media streams; UDP does not have any mech-
anism to control congestion and has the capability to create a
congestion collapse.
