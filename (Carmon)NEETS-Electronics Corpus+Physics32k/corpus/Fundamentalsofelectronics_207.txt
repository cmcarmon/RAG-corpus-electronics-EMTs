3.12 Equivalent Circuits: Impedances and Sources23
When we have circuits with capacitors and/or inductors as well as resistors and sources, Thévenin and Mayer-
Norton equivalent circuits can still be deﬁned by using impedances and complex amplitudes for voltage and
currents. For any circuit containing sources, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, the input-output relation
for the complex amplitudes of the terminal voltage and current is
