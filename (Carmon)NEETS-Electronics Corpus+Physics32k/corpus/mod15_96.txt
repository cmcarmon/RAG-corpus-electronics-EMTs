There are two types of damping methods ELECTRICAL and MECHANICAL. In small synchros the 
electrical method is used more frequently than the mechanical method. This method uses an additional 
winding placed in the synchro to retard oscillations. In larger units, a mechanical device, known as an 
inertia damper, is more effective. Several variations of the inertia damper are in use. One of the more 
common types consists of a heavy brass flywheel (inertia damper), which is free to rotate around a 
bushing that is attached to the rotor shaft (fig. 1-15). A tension spring on the bushing rubs against the 
flywheel so that the bushing and flywheel turn together during normal operation. If the rotor shaft turns or 
tends to change its speed or direction of rotation suddenly, the inertia of the damper opposes the changing 
condition.
