■ METHOD 1 One  way  is  to  ﬁrst  do  the  dc  PSpice analysis  to
determine the initial capacitor voltage. The schematic of the revelant
circuit  is  in  Fig.  7.68(a).  Two  pseudocomponent  VIEWPOINTs  are
inserted to measure the voltages at nodes 1 and 2. When the circuit
is  simulated,  we  obtain  the  displayed  values  in  Fig.  7.68(a)  as
v(0) ⫽
V1 ⫽ 0 V
V1 ⫺ V2  ⫽ ⫺8 V.
The PSpice transient analysis uses this value along
with  the  schematic  in  Fig.  7.68(b).  Once  the  circuit  in  Fig.  7.68(b)
is  drawn,  we  insert  the  capacitor  initial  voltage  as 
We
select  Analysis/Setup/Transient and  set  Print  Step to  0.1  s  and
After saving the circuit, we select Analysis/
Final Step to 
Simulate to  simulate  the  circuit.  In  the  PSpice A/D  window,  we
V(R2:2) ⫺ V(R3:2) or V(C1:1) ⫺
select  Trace/Add and  display 
v(t).
is  shown  in
as  the  capacitor  voltage

Fig.  7.69.  This  agrees  with  the  result  obtained  by  hand  calculation,
v(t) ⫽ 10 ⫺ 18 e⫺t V.
