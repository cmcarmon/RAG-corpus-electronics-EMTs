both its rows and columns. Figure 4.25 shows an image and its
wavelet transform. Figure 4.25(B) shows that the wavelet trans-
form contains mostly coefﬁcients with small magnitudes. In
addition, the transform’s bands are directional; that is, besides
the low-frequency band, one can see horizontal, vertical, and
diagonal bands. From an image compression point of view, it
is important to notice that the coefﬁcients with small value,
which are put to zero after quantization, tend to be clustered.
This facilitates their efﬁcient coding, thereby producing high
compression ratios. Image coding methods based on the wave-
