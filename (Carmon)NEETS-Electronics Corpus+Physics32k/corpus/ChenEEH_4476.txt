Optimal control theory deals with the optimization, either
minimization or maximization, of a given cost criterion.
Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control, minimum cost-variance
control, and risk-sensitive control are discussed in terms of
cost cumulants. Figure 5.1 presents an overview of the optimal
control and the relationships among different optimal control
methods.
