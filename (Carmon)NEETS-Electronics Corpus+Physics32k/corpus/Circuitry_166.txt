their inputs. 
  The effectiveness of the simple integrator circuit 
shown  in  Fig.  3.33  depends  on  the  ratio  of  time 
constant, C × R, to periodic time, t. The larger this 
ratio is, the more effective the circuit will be as an 
integrator.  The  effectiveness  of  the  circuit  of  Fig.

the 
waveforms shown in Fig. 3.34. 
  Similarly, 
the  simple 
differentiator  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  3.35  also 
depends  on  the  ratio  of  time  constant  C × R, to 
periodic time, t. The smaller this ratio is, the more 
effective the circuit will be as a differentiator. 
  The  effectiveness  of  the  circuit  of  Fig.  3.35  is 
illustrated  by  the  input  and  output  waveforms 
shown in Fig. 3.36.
