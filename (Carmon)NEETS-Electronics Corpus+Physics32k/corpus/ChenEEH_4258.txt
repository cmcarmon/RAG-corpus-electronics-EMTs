Different MAC protocols produce different types of over-
head. For the contention protocols, like ALOHA, CSMA, and
CSMA/CD, the overheads are collisions, acknowledgment, and
waste of slot time. For the token bus protocol, the overheads
are the passing token (even when the network is idle), token
transmission, and acknowledgment. For the token ring proto-
col, the overhead is just waiting for the token when the other
station has no data to send.
