The Newfoundland Time Zone is a geographic region that keeps time by subtracting ​3 1⁄2 hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) during standard time, resulting in UTC−03:30; or subtracting ​2 1⁄2 hours during daylight saving time. The clock time in this zone is based on the mean solar time of the meridian 52 degrees and 30 arcminutes west of the Greenwich Observatory.
