(cid:1) This chapter also showed how digital gates could be built using MOSFETs
and resistors. We discussed how the digital circuits had to be designed so
they met the VIH, VOH, VIL, and VOL voltage thresholds specified by a
given static discipline. We also estimated the power dissipation of logic
gates using their circuit models.
