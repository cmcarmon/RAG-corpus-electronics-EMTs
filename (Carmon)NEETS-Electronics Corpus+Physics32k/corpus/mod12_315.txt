In practice, a circuit like this could not provide enough phase shift to produce the desired results in
the output. Several of these circuits are arranged in cascade to provide the desired amount of phase shift.
Also, since the output of this circuit will vary in amplitude, the signal is fed to a limiter to remove
amplitude variations.
