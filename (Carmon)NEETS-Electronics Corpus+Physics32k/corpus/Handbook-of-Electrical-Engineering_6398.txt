data,  which  are  partitioned  into  k-bit  and  (m  –  k)-bit  words  where  k  ‡  m.  The  k-bit  words  (frames)  are
convolutionally encoded into (n = k + 1)-bit words so that the code rate is R = k/(k + 1). The amplitude and
phase are then set jointly on the basis of the coded n-bit word and the uncoded (m – k)-bit word. Almost 6
dB of coding gain can be realized if coders of constraint length 9 are used.
