Typical laser diode spectral widths are between 1 and 5 nm when operating in more than one longitudinal
mode. Single-mode laser diodes can have spectral widths of just a few tenths of a nanometer. As predicted by
Eq. (71.10), narrow-spectral-width emitters minimize pulse spreading. Minimizing pulse spreading increases
the Ô¨Åber bandwidth and its data capacity.
