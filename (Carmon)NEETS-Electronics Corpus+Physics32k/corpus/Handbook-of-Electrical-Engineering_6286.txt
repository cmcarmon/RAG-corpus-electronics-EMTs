The power ampliﬁer raises the output energy of the transmitter to the desired RF operating level. Tetrodes
in television service are operated in the class B mode to obtain reasonable efﬁciency while maintaining a linear
transfer characteristic. Class B ampliﬁers, when operated in tuned circuits, provide linear performance because
of the ﬂywheel effect of the resonance circuit. This allows a single tube to be used instead of two in push-pull
fashion. The bias point of the linear ampliﬁer is chosen so that the transfer characteristic at low modulation
levels matches that at higher modulation levels. The plate (anode) circuit of a tetrode PA is usually built around
a coaxial resonant cavity, which provides a stable and reliable tank circuit.
