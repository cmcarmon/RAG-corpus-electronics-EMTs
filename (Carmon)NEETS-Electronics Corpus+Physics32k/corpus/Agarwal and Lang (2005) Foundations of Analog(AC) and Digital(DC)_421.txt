in this section, we have shown that once the node voltages
for a circuit are known, we can readily determine all the branch voltages by
applying KVL, and then the branch currents from the branch voltages and
element laws. Since we can determine branch currents from node voltages and
element laws, we can also write KCL for each of the nodes in a network in
terms of node voltages and the element parameters. Although our doing so
appears unmotivated at this point, we will make use of this fact in node analysis
in Section 3.3.
