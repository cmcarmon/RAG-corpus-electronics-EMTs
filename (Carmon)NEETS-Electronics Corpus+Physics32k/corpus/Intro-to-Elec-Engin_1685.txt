in which the chip itself is programmed to perform speciÔ¨Åc functions. Digital watches and auto
fuel-injection systems are examples. With microprocessor control, not only the same hardware
can be used to perform a variety of tasks by reprogramming, but also distributed computation
(which results in less expensive and more reliable operation than centralized control) is possible
with interconnection and intercommunication of several microprocessors.
