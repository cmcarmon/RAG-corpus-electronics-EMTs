current iL, respectively. The noise vs in the power supply voltage satisfies vs (cid:10) VS, and
is responsible for the presence of il in iL.
The current source contains a MOSFET which operates in its saturation region such
that iDS = K
terminal characteristics are described graphically next. Assume that VS > VN > VT.
a) Assume vs = 0. Determine VGS, the large-signal component of vGS, in terms of RB,
