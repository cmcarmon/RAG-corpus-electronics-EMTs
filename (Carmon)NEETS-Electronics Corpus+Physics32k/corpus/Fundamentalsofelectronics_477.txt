(e) Find the transfer function of the simplest possible linear model (a ﬁrst-order ﬁlter, either lowpass or
highpass) that would describe the data. Note that the phase shift is negative: the output lags (occurs
later) than the input. Based on this observation, which ﬁrst-order model ﬁts the data and what is its
transfer function?
