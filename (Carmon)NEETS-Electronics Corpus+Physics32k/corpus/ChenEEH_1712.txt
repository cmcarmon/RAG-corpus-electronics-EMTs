High-Level Semantic Modeling
As pointed out earlier, high-level indexing and retrieval of
visual information, as depicted at level 2 or level 3 in Figure
6.1, requires semantic analysis that is beyond the scope of
many of the low-level feature-based techniques. One import-
ant consideration that many existing content modeling
schemes overlook is the importance of the multimodal nature
of video data composed of a sequence of images along with
associated audio and, in many cases, textual captions. Fusing
data from multiple modalities improves the overall perform-
ance of the system. Many of the content modeling schemes
based on low-level features work on a query by example (QBE)
paradigm in which the user is required to submit a video clip
or an image illustrating the desired visual features. At times,
this constraint becomes prohibitive when an example video
clip or image depicting what the person is seeking is not at
hand. Query by keyword (QBK) offers an alternative to QBE in
the high-level semantic representation. In this scenario, a
single keyword or a combination of many can be used to
search through the video database. This requires more sophis-
ticated indexing, however, because keywords summarizing the
video content need to be generated during the indexing stage.
This capability can be achieved by incorporating knowledge
base into video indexing and retrieval systems. There has
been a drive toward incorporating intelligence into CBVIR
systems, and intelligence-based ideas and systems will be
covered in this section. Modeling video data and designing
semantic reasoning-based video database management systems
(VDBMSs) facilitate high-level querying and manipulating of
video data. A prominent issue associated with this domain is
the development of formal techniques for semantic modeling
of multimedia information. Another problem in this context is
the design of powerful indexing, searching, and organization
methods for multimedia data.
