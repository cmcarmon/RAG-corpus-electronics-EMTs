Acoustic noise and vibrations of electric motors are usually classified in three sources:
mechanical sources (e.g. due to bearings)
aerodynamic sources (e.g. due to shaft-mounted fans)
magnetic sources (e.g. due to magnetic forces such as Maxwell and magnetostriction forces acting on stator and rotor structures)
The latter source, which can be responsible for the "whining noise" of electric motors, is called electromagnetically-excited acoustic noise.
