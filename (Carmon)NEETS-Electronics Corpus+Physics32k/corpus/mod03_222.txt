The current whose frequency is to be measured flows through the coil and exerts maximum
attraction on the soft-iron armature TWICE during each cycle (fig. 1-47(A)). The armature is attached to
the bar, which is mounted on a flexible support. Reeds having natural vibration frequencies of 110, 112,
114, and so forth, up to 130 hertz are mounted on the bar (fig. 1-47(B)). The reed having a frequency of
110 hertz is marked 55 hertz; the one having a frequency of 112 hertz is marked 56 hertz; the one having
a frequency of 120 hertz is marked 60 hertz; and so forth.
