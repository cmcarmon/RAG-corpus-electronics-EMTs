If you remove the battery and replace it with a wire so that the circuit consists 
of just the resistor and the capacitor, the capacitor will discharge through the 
resistor. This time, the voltage across the resistor is equal to the voltage 
across the capacitor (V
c), so the current is Vc/R. Hereâ€™s what happens:
