A body may also have a rotational stiffness, k, given by




k
=


M
θ




{\displaystyle k={\frac {M}{\theta }}}

where
M is the applied moment
θ is the rotation
In the SI system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in newton-metres per radian.
In the SAE system, rotational stiffness is typically measured in inch-pounds per degree.
Further measures of stiffness are derived on a similar basis, including:
shear stiffness - ratio of applied shear force to shear deformation
torsional stiffness - ratio of applied torsion moment to angle of twist
