To be a complete project plan according to industry standards such as the PMBOK or PRINCE2, the project plan must also describe the execution, management and control of the project. This information can be provided by referencing other documents that will be produced, such as a procurement plan or construction plan, or it may be detailed in the project plan itself.
The project plan typically covers topics used in the project execution system and includes the following main aspects:
Scope management
Requirements management
Schedule management
Financial management
Quality management
Resource management
Stakeholder management â€“ New from PMBOK 5
Communications management
Project change management
Risk management
