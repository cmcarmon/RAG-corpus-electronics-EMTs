Step 1—Charging the PC. The most common approach used is corona charging. One or more thin corona
wires (typically tungsten) are supported directly above the PC and are energized to 5–8 kV. The resultant high
electric  ﬁeld  surrounding  the  wire  causes  electrons  in  the  immediate  region  to  be  accelerated  to  energies
sufﬁcient to ionize local air molecules. Either positive or negative ions are then attracted to the outer surface
of the PC (which, when unexposed to light, acts for a short period of time as an insulator) depending on the
sign of the potential difference. At the same time, a counter-image charge is formed on the inner side of the
PC. The two corona structures most commonly used are the corotron and the scorotron (see Fig. 89.22). The
grid on the scorotron is used to more precisely control the resultant voltage charge level on the PC (approximates
the grid voltage). Both dc and ac designs are used; the latter usually include a glass sleeve around the corona
wire to reduce localized high-emission spots on the wire due to contaminants. To save on cost for very low-
cost EP printers and to reduce corona by-products (e.g., ozone), a lower-voltage conductive elastomer charge
roll in direct contact with the PC has also been used in place of the corona wire.
