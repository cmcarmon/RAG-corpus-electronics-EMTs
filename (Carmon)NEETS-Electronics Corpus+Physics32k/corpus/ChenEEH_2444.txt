FIGURE 6.12 A Linear Dipole Antenna of Arbitrary Length L. This
antenna can be treated as a number of ‘‘slices’’ of small dipole
elements. The total ﬁeld can be obtained by superposing the ﬁelds
due to the individual small dipole slices having current I(z), having
length Dz, and being located at distance z from the center.
