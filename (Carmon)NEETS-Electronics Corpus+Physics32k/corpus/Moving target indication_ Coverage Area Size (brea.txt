Coverage area size is the area that the system can keep under continuous surveillance from a specific orbit. Well known design principles cause a radar’s maximum detection range to depend on the size of its antenna (radar aperture), the amount of power radiated from the antenna, and the effectiveness of its clutter cancellation mechanism. The earth’s curvature and screening from terrain, foliage, and buildings cause system altitude to be another key factor determining depth of coverage. The ability to cover an area the size of an army corps commander’s area of interest from a safe stand-off distance is the hallmark of an effective, advanced GMTI system.
