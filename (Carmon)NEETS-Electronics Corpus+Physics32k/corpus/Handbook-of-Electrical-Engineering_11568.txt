Deafness is another manifestation of a loss of a communication channel, this time for the sense of hearing.
Totally deaf individuals use vision as a substitute input channel when communicating via sign language (also
a  substitute  code),  and  can  sign  at  information  rates  that  match  or  exceed  that  of  verbal  communication.
Hearing  aids  are  now  commercially  available  that  can  adaptively  ﬁlter  out  background  noise  (a  predictable
signal) while amplifying speech (unpredictable) using autoregressive, moving average (ARMA) signal process-
ing. With the recent advent of powerful digital signal processing chips, true digital hearing aids are now available.
Previous analog aids, or digitally programmable analog aids, provided a set of tunable ﬁlters and ampliﬁers to
cover the low-, mid-, and high-frequency ranges of the hearing spectrum. But the digital aids can be speciﬁcally
and easily tailored (i.e., programmed) to compensate for the speciﬁc losses of each individual client across the
frequency  continuum  of  hearing,  and  still  provide  automatic  gain  control  and  one  or  more  user-selectable
settings that have been adjusted to perform optimally in differing noise environments.
