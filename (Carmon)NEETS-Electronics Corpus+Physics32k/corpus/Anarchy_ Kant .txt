The German philosopher Immanuel Kant treated anarchy in his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View as consisting of "Law and Freedom without Force". Thus, for Kant, anarchy falls short of being a true civil state because the law is only an "empty recommendation" if force is not included to make this law efficacious ("legitimation", etymologically fancifully from "lex timere" = "fearing the law"). For there to be such a state, force must be included while law and freedom are maintained, a state which Kant calls a republic.
Kant identified four kinds of government:
law and freedom without force (anarchy)
law and force without freedom (despotism)
force without freedom and law (barbarism)
force with freedom and law (republic)
