In astrodynamics, the semi-major axis



a


{\displaystyle a}
can be calculated from orbital state vectors:




a
=
−


μ

2
ε






{\displaystyle a=-{\mu  \over {2\varepsilon }}\,}

for an elliptical orbit and, depending on the convention, the same or




a
=


μ

2
ε






{\displaystyle a={\mu  \over {2\varepsilon }}\,}

for a hyperbolic trajectory
and




ε
=



v

r

{\displaystyle \varepsilon ={v^{2} \over {2}}-{\mu  \over \left|\mathbf {r} \right|}}

(specific orbital energy)
and




μ
=
G
M



{\displaystyle \mu =GM\,}

(standard gravitational parameter), where:




v


{\displaystyle v}
is orbital velocity from velocity vector of an orbiting object,
r is a cartesian position vector of an orbiting object in coordinates of a reference frame with respect to which the elements of the orbit are to be calculated (e.g. geocentric equatorial for an orbit around Earth, or heliocentric ecliptic for an orbit around the Sun),




G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant,




M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass of the gravitating body, and




ε


{\displaystyle \varepsilon }
is the specific energy of the orbiting body.
Note that for a given amount of total mass, the specific energy and the semi-major axis are always the same, regardless of eccentricity or the ratio of the masses. Conversely, for a given total mass and semi-major axis, the total specific orbital energy is always the same. This statement will always be true under any given conditions.
