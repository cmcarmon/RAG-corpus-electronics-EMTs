For large systems, computer formulation of the sequence impedance matrices is required. Refer to Further
Information for more detail. Zero sequence networks for lines in close proximity to each other (on a common
right-of-way)  will  be  mutually  coupled.  If  we  are  willing  to  use  the  same  values  for  positive  and  negative
sequence machine impedances,
