This process of the cell providing electrical energy to supply a load is called discharging,
since it is depleting its internal chemical reserves. Theoretically, after all of the sulfuric acid
has been exhausted, the result will be two electrodes of lead sulfate (PbSO4) and an electrolyte
solution of pure water (H2O), leaving no more capacity for additional ionic bonding. In this
state, the cell is said to be fully discharged. In a lead-acid cell, the state of charge can be
determined by an analysis of acid strength. This is easily accomplished with a device called
a hydrometer, which measures the speciÔ¨Åc gravity (density) of the electrolyte. Sulfuric acid is
denser than water, so the greater the charge of a cell, the greater the acid concentration, and
thus a denser electrolyte solution.
