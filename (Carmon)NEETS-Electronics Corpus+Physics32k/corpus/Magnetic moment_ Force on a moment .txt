A magnetic moment in an externally produced magnetic field has a potential energy U:




U

μ

⋅

B



{\displaystyle U=-{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\cdot \mathbf {B} }

In a case when the external magnetic field is non-uniform, there will be a force, proportional to the magnetic field gradient, acting on the magnetic moment itself. There has been some discussion on how to calculate the force acting on a magnetic dipole. There are two expressions for the force acting on a magnetic dipole, depending on whether the model used for the dipole is a current loop or two monopoles (analogous to the electric dipole). The force obtained in the case of a current loop model is






F

∇

μ

B

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text{loop}}=\nabla \left({\boldsymbol {\mu }}\cdot \mathbf {B} \right)}

In the case of a pair of monopoles being used (i.e. electric dipole model)






F

=

(


μ

B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text{dipole}}=\left({\boldsymbol {\mu }}\cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf {B} }

and one can be put in terms of the other via the relation

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{\text{loop}}=\mathbf {F} _{\text{dipole}}+{\boldsymbol {\mu }}\times \left(\nabla \times \mathbf {B} \right)}

In all these expressions μ is the dipole and B is the magnetic field at its position. Note that if there are no currents or time-varying electrical fields ∇ × B = 0 and the two expressions agree.
An electron, nucleus, or atom placed in a uniform magnetic field will precess with a frequency known as the Larmor frequency. See Resonance.
