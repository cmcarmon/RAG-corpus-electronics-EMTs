Note that the steady-state solution for a step input r0 is the same whether or not error-rate
damping is present. The advantage of error-rate damping lies in the fact that it allows higher
gains to be used without adversely affecting the damping ratio, and thereby makes it possible to
satisfy the speciﬁcations for the damping ratio as well as for the steady-state performance. Also,
the system’s natural frequency is increased, which in turn implies smaller settling times.
