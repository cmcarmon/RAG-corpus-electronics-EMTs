External bias, applied in either the forward or reverse direction, as shown in figure 2-42B and C, 
affects the magnitude, barrier potential, and width of the depletion area. Enough forward or reverse bias 
will overcome the barrier potential and cause current to flow through the diode. The width of the 
depletion region can be controlled by keeping the bias voltage at levels that do not allow current flow. 
Since the depletion area acts as a capacitor, the diode will perform as a variable capacitor that changes 
with the applied bias voltage. The capacitance of a typical varactor can vary from 2 to 50 picofarads for a 
bias variation of just 2 volts.
