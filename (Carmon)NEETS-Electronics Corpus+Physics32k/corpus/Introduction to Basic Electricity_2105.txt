Now, let us take Figure 17-12 another step and 
divide resistor R2 into two resistors, R and R3, which 
are 4 kΩ and 1 kΩ, as shown in Figure 17-13. As far 
as the voltage source is concerned, nothing has really 
changed in the circuit because the total resistance is 
still 10 kΩ. There is still 1 mA of current flowing in the 
circuit. The important difference is that now there are 
multiple voltage drops. The voltage drop at the junc-
tion of R1 and R2 is still 5 volts.
