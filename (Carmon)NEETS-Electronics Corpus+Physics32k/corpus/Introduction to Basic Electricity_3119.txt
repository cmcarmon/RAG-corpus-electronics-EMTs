increases as the temperature increases. Zener diodes 
that have a breakdown voltage of less than 4 V have a 
negative zener voltage-temperature coefficient, which 
means that the breakdown voltage decreases with an  
increase  in  temperature.  Zener  diodes  with  a 
 breakdown voltage between 4 and 5 volts may have a 
positive or negative voltage-temperature coefficient.
