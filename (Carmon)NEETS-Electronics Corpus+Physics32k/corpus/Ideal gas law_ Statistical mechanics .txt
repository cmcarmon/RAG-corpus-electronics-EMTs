In statistical mechanics the following molecular equation is derived from first principles




P
=
n

k

B


T
,


{\displaystyle P=nk_{\text{B}}T,}

where P is the absolute pressure of the gas, n is the number of molecules in the given volume V (the number density is given by the ratio n = N/V, in contrasts to the previous formulation in which n is the number of moles), T is the absolute temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant relating temperature and energy, given by:





k

B


=


R

N

A






{\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}={\frac {R}{N_{\text{A}}}}}

where NA is Avogadro's constant.
From this we notice that for a gas of mass m, with an average particle mass of μ times the atomic mass constant, mu, (i.e., the mass is μ u) the number of molecules will be given by




N
=


m

μ

m

u





,


{\displaystyle N={\frac {m}{\mu m_{\text{u}}}},}

and since ρ = m/V = nμmu, we find that the ideal gas law can be rewritten as

{\displaystyle P={\frac {1}{V}}{\frac {m}{\mu m_{\text{u}}}}k_{B}T={\frac {k_{B}}{\mu m_{\text{u}}}}\rho T.}

In SI units, P is measured in pascals, V in cubic metres, and T in measured kelvins. kB has the value 1.38·10−23 J/K in SI units.
