The whole point is that the inverting input to the operational amplifier shown in figure 3-13 is at
virtual ground since it is at 0 volts (for all practical purposes). Because the inverting input is at 0 volts,
there will be no current (for all practical purposes) flowing into the operational amplifier from the
connection point of R1 and R2.
