ER1 = (500 µA)(3 kΩ) = 1.5 V
ER2 = (500 µA)(10 kΩ) = 5 V
ER3 = (500 µA)(5 kΩ) = 2.5 V
Notice the voltage drops across each resistor, and how the sum of the voltage drops (1.5 +
5 + 2.5) is equal to the battery (supply) voltage: 9 volts. This is the third principle of series
circuits: that the supply voltage is equal to the sum of the individual voltage drops.
