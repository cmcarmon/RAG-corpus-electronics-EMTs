Consider the parameter values typical of current optical disk technology: R = 67 mm corresponding to 5.25-in.
diameter platters, D0 = 0.5 mm which is roughly determined by the wavelength of the read/write laser diodes,
and Wt + Wg = 1 mm for the track pitch. The disk capacity will then be around 28 Â·  109 bits, or 3.5 gigabytes.
This is a reasonable estimate and one that is fairly close to reality, despite the many simplifying assumptions
made in its derivation. In the following paragraphs we examine some of these assumptions in more detail.
