Graphs  provide  us  with  a  visual  way  of 
representing data. They can also be used to show, 
in a simple pictorial way, how one variable affects 
another  variable.  Several  different  types  of  graph 
are used in electronics. We shall start by looking at 
the most basic type, the straight line graph. 
 
Straight line graphs 
Earlier  we  introduced  the  idea  of  proportionality.
In particular, we showed that the current flowing in 
a circuit  was  directly  proportional  to  the  voltage 
applied to it. We expressed this using the following 
mathematical notation: 
 
i
where  i represents  load  current  and  v represents 
output voltage. 
  We can illustrate this relationship using a simple 
graph showing current, i, plotted against voltage, v.
Letâ€™s assume that the voltage applied to the circuit 
varies over the range 1 V to 6 V and the circuit has 
a resistance  of  3  W.  By 
taking  a  set  of 
measurements of v and i (see Fig. A8.6) we would 
obtain the following table of corresponding values 
shown below:
