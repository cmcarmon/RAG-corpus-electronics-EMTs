Large format removable cores from manufacturers Assa Abloy, BiLock, Corbin-Russwin, Medeco, Mul-T-Lock, Sargent, Schlage and Yale are not interchangeable with any other make or model. Although similar in appearance when installed, no two actually share exactly the same form or function. More precisely, for example:
Each core from Corbin-Russwin is removed and reinstalled via a partial two-chambered pin section with a unique shear line that rotates into and out of the chassis when any common change key or master key with the proper cuts is encountered, and, therefore, is incompatible with all Schlage removable cores, which release and resecure by means of a lateral pin at the back that is controlled by a specialized key cut to match any functioning change key or master key or combination thereof.
