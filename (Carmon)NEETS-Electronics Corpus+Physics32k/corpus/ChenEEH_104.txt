ated with two variables: the voltage variable v(t ) and the
current variable i(t). Reference directions are also assigned
to the network elements as shown in Figure 2.7 so that i(t ) is
positive whenever the current is in the direction of the arrow
and so that v(t ) is positive whenever the voltage drop in the
network element is in the direction of the arrow. Replacing
each element and its associated reference direction by a
directed edge results in the directed graph representing the
network. For example, a simple electrical network and the
corresponding directed graph are shown in Figure 2.8.
