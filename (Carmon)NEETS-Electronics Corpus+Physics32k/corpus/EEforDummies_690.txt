You may see labels in addition to V+ for the positive power supply pin on an 
IC. Different chip manufacturers use different conventions, but it’s common 
to see VDD used in CMOS chips and VCC used in TTL chips (see Figure 11-2). 
Refer to the sidebar “Meet the logic families” for details on CMOS and TTL.
