Large capacitors, dormant in storage, can also develop a large static charge. This charge is caused by
environmental conditions such as a close proximity to an rf field. An easy way to avoid this condition is
to short the stored capacitor's terminals with a piece of wire before putting it in storage. Remember to
remove the wire before installing the capacitor. If you receive a large capacitor that is not shorted, short
the terminals together. Remember, CHARGED CAPACITORS CAN KILL.
