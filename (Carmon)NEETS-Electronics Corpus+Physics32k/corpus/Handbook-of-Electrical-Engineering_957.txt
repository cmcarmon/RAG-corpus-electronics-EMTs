Commercial software is available that provides both extraction and optimization together. The idea here is
to ﬁrst use extraction techniques to make reasonable initial guesses and then use these results as a starting point
for optimization, because optimization can give very poor results if poor initial guesses for the parameters are
used. Nothing is wrong with using extraction techniques to provide initial guesses for optimization, but for an
experienced user this is rarely necessary, assuming that the least-squares curve ﬁtting routine is robust (converges
well) and the experienced user has some knowledge of the process under characterization. Software that relies
heavily on extraction may do so because of the nonrobustness of its optimizer.
