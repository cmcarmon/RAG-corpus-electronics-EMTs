A number of display methods are in use that are designed to reduce the depth of the crt display 
caused by the length of the tube. These devices are collectively known as flat panel displays. Three types 
of flat panel displays commonly in use with computer systems are liquid crystal displays (LCDs), gas 
plasma displays (GPDs), and electroluminescent displays (ELDs).
