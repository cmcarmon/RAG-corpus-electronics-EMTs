Duncan's paradox is a thermodynamic thought experiment proposed by T. Duncan in 2000  that has connections to the second law of thermodynamics and catalysis. It was raised in response to an earlier theoretical proposal suggesting that certain gas-surface reactions (heterogeneous catalysis) can generate steady-state pressure gradients under low-pressure, sealed blackbody conditions.
Duncan's paradox was devised to demonstrate the incompatibility of these purported pressure gradients with the second law of thermodynamics. Specifically, such pressure gradients would allow construction of perpetual motion machines of the second type; therefore, because such devices are presumed thermodynamically impossible, the enabling pressure gradients must also be impossible.
