Source Coding
An  encoder for  the  clean  signal  maps  vectors  of  that  signal  onto  a  ﬁnite  set  of  representative  signal  vectors
referred  to  as  codewords.  The  mapping  is  performed  by  assigning  each  signal  vector  to  its  nearest  neighbor
codeword. The index of the chosen codeword is transmitted to the receiver in a signal communication system,
and the signal is reconstructed using a copy of the chosen codeword. The codewords are designed to minimize
the  average  distortion  resulting  from  the  nearest  neighbor  mapping.  The  codewords  may  simply  represent
waveform vectors of the signal. In another important application of low bit-rate speech coding, the codewords
represent a set of parameter vectors of the AR model for the speech signal. Such coding systems synthesize the
signal using the speech model in Fig. 15.2. The synthesis is performed using the encoded vector of AR coefﬁcients
as well as the parameters of the excitation signal. Reasonably good speech quality can be obtained using this
coding approach at rates as low as 2400–4800 bits/sample [Gersho and Gray, 1991].
