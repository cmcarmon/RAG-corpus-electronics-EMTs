When the pound is used as a unit of mass, the core of the coherent system is similar and functionally equivalent to the corresponding subsets of the International System of Units (SI), using metre, kilogram and second (MKS), and the earlier centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS).
In this sub-system, the unit of force is a derived unit known as the poundal.

The international standard symbol for the pound as unit of mass rather than force is lb.
Everett (1861) proposed the metric dyne and erg as the units of force and energy in the FPS system.
Latimer Clark's (1891) "Dictionary of Measures" contains celo (acceleration), vel or velo (velocity) and pulse (momentum) as proposed names for FPS absolute units.
