One of the great strengths of integrated optic technology is the possibility of integrating different types or
multiple copies of the same type of device on a single substrate. While this concept is routinely used in the
semiconductor IC industry, its application in the optical domain is novel. The scale of integration in integrated
optics is quite modest by semiconductor standards. To date the most complex component demonstrated is an
