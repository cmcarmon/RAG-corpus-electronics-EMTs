Standard Cell ASIC Technology
Consider  a  full  custom  circuit  design  completed  using  only  predeﬁned  logic  cells  from  a  foundry-provided
speciﬁc library and physical design processes provided by standard EDA/CAD tools. This approach, standard
cell design [Heinbuch, 1987, SCMOS Standard Cell Library, 1989], is one of the primary ASIC technologies. A
critical  issue  impacting  standard  cell ASIC  design  is  the  quality  of  the  standard  cell  library  provided  by  the
foundry. By providing a rich set of library cells, the coordination between the logical design and the physical
design is substantially more effective. Figure 25.31(a) also illustrates the general standard cell approach, using
standard  library  cells  of  design-speciﬁed  height  (according  to  cells  used),  design-speciﬁed  width  logic  rows,
and  varying  width  of  the  wiring  channel  to  accommodate  the  number  of  interconnection  wires  determined
during place and route.
