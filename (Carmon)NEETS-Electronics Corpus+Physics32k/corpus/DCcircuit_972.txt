Mesh current I1 is going “up” through R2, while mesh current I2 is going “down” through R2.
To determine the actual current through R2, we must see how mesh currents I1 and I2 interact
(in this case they’re in opposition), and algebraically add them to arrive at a ﬁnal value. Since
I1 is going “up” at 5 amps, and I2 is going “down” at 1 amp, the real current through R2 must
be a value of 4 amps, going “up:”
