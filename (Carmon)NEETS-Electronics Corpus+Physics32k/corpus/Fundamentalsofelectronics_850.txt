Communication theory has been formulated best for symbolic-valued signals. Claude Shannon27 published
in 1948 The Mathematical Theory of Communication, which became the cornerstone of digital communi-
cation. He showed the power of probabilistic models for symbolic-valued signals, which allowed him to
quantify the information present in a signal. In the simplest signal model, each symbol can occur at index
n with a probability Pr [ak], k = {1, . . . , K}. What this model says is that for each signal value a K-sided
coin is ï¬‚ipped (note that the coin need not be fair). For this model to make sense, the probabilities must be
numbers between zero and one and must sum to one.
