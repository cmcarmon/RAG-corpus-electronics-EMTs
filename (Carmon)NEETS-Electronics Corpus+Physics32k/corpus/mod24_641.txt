the emitting region of the light source. If the fiber end face is directly placed over the source emitting
region, it is referred to as butt coupling. If the source's output light pattern is larger than the fiber's
acceptance pattern, source-to-fiber coupling efficiency may be improved by placing a small lens between
the source and fiber. Lensing schemes improve coupling efficiency when coupling both LEDs and LDs to
optical fibers.
