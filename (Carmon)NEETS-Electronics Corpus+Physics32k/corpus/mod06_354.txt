In view C, the source voltage has been raised to 200 volts. This will cause more gas in the tube to
ionize and 40 milliamperes of current to flow through the tube. The increased ionization will lower the
resistance of the tube (rkp). Thus, the tube will still drop 105 volts. The tubeâ€™s resistance (rkp) at this time
will be equal to:
