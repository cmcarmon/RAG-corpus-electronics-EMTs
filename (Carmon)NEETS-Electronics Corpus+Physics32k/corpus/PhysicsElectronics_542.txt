The common source conﬁguration for a FET is similar to the common emitter bipolar tran-
sistor conﬁguration, and is shown in ﬁgure 5.17. The common source ampliﬁer can provide
both a voltage and current gain. Since the input resistance looking into the gate is extremely
large the current gain available from the FET ampliﬁer can be quite large, but the voltage
gain is generally inferior to that available from a bipolar device. Thus FET ampliﬁers are
most useful with high output-impedance signal sources where a large current gain is the pri-
mary requirement. The source by-pass capacitor provides a low impedance path to ground
