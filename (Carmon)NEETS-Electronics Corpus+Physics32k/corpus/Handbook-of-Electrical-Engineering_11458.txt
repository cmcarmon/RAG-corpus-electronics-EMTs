Energy Resolution
A  typical  spectrum  of  an  241Am  alpha-particle  source  taken  with  an  ion-implanted  detector  is  shown  in
Fig. 116.18. While the factors considered in Eq. (116.7) for germanium gamma-ray spectrometers are still valid,
additional  considerations  also  apply.  In  particular,  if  the  source  is  moved  closer  to  the  detector  to  improve
collection  efﬁciency,  larger  differences  in  the  angle  of  incidence  will  produce  peak  broadening  due  to  larger
variation in effective window thickness. Even when the source is sufﬁciently distanced from the detector, there
