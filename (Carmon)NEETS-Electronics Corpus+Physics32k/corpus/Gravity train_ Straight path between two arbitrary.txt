For the more general case of the straight line path between any two points on the surface of a sphere we calculate the acceleration of the body as it moves frictionlessly along its straight path.
The body travels along AOB, O being the midpoint of the path, and the closest point to the center of the Earth on this path. At distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
along this path, the force of gravity depends on distance



x


{\displaystyle x}
to the center of the Earth as above. Using the shorthand



b
=
R
sin

θ


{\displaystyle b=R\sin \theta }
for length OC:

g


{\displaystyle g_{r}={\frac {x}{R}}\,g={\frac {\sqrt {r^{2}+b^{2}}}{R}}\,g}

The resulting acceleration on the body, because is it on a frictionless inclined surface, is

{\displaystyle a_{r}=g_{r}\cos \varphi ={\frac {\sqrt {r^{2}+b^{2}}}{R}}\,g\cos \varphi }

which is exactly the same for this new



r


{\displaystyle r}
, distance along AOB away from O, as for the



r


{\displaystyle r}
in the diametric case along ACD. So the remaining analysis is the same, accommodating the initial condition that the maximal

is

The time constant

is the same as in the diametric case so the journey time is still 42 minutes; it's just that all the distances and speeds are scaled by the constant
