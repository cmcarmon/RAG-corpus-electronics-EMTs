Riders are usually advised to do a lowsider rather than a highsider if neither can be avoided. The lowsider has the advantage of the motorcycle sliding before the rider, thus not threatening to crush him or her. Also, a lowsider tends to send the rider sliding across the road whereas a highsider is considered more severe as it violently throws the rider from the motorcycle with a higher probability of broken bones.
The main injury risks are:
gravel rash due to sliding across tarmac at speed
hitting traffic coming in the opposing lane
impact injuries on the side the rider goes down (usually an elbow, shoulder or hip contusion, but the bike landing on an ankle can cause injuries, too)
hitting static objects on the side of the road such as street furniture or signage
