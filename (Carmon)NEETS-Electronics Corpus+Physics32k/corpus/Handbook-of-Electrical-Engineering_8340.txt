The TAP controller is characterized by a 16-state ﬁnite-state machine (FSM) whose behavior is deﬁned by
the  IEEE  1149.1  Standard.  State  transitions  of  the  TAP  FSM  are  controlled  by  the  TMS  input  line  and  the
dedicated test clock, TCK. Figure 85.18 shows the state-transition diagram for the TAP FSM.
