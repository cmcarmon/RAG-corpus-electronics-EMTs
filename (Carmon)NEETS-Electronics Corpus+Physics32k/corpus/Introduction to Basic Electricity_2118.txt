Junction C has 560 mA of current entering it 
through the divider chain, and it is summed with the 
current from the 9-volt load, which is 600 mA. This 
summation becomes the total current flowing through 
the final resistor R1 to be a value of 1160 mA, or 1.16 A.
The final step in the process is calculating the val-
ues of R1, R2, R3, and R4. These calculations involve 
nothing more than applying Ohmâ€™s law. Again, start 
at the bottom of the network with resistor R4. At this 
point in the circuit, it is determined that there is only 
the previously selected 10 mA of current flowing. The 
desired voltage at junction A is 3 volts. Therefore, the 
following relationships exist:
