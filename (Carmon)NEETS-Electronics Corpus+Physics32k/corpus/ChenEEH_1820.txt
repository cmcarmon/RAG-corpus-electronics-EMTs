. Interior node: An interior node is completely inside a DS
domain and is connected to other interior nodes or
boundary nodes in the same DS domain. The interior
nodes only perform packet forwarding. When a packet
with a particular DS code point arrives at this node, it is
forwarded to the next hop according to some predeﬁned
rule associated with the packet class. Such predeﬁned
rules are called perhop behaviors (PHBs), which are
discussed next.
