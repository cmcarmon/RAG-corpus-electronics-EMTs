In order to examine certain parameter estimation schemes we need ﬁrst to present the deﬁnition of some
related functions. Penalty or cost function c[qm, q^ m(xn)] is a scalar, nonnegative function whose values vary as
qm varies in the parameter space E m and as the sequence xn takes different values in the observation space, Gn.
Conditional expected penalty c(qm, q^ m) induced by the parameter estimate and the penalty function is a function
deﬁned as follows:
