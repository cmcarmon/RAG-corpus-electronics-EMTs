Making a prototype by hand is a great way to start 
bringing the electronic circuit to life. Remember, there 
are no rules, so the prototyping stage is a great time 
to use untapped creative ability and to explore all the 
possibilities. Donâ€™t be limited by any preconceived no-
tions with regards to electronic circuit fabrication.
