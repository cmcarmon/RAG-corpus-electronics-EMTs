Cars do not appear and disappear. Consider any group of cars: from the particular car at the back of the group located at



x
=
a
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x=a(t)}
to the particular car at the front located at



x
=
b
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x=b(t)}
. The total number of cars in this group

{\displaystyle N=\int _{a(t)}^{b(t)}\rho (x,t)\,dx}
. Since cars are conserved (if there is overtaking, then the `car at the front \ back' may become a different car)

{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{rcl}{\frac {dN}{dt}}&=&{\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{a(t)}^{b(t)}\rho (x,t)\,dx\\&=&\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}\,dx+\rho (b,t){\frac {db}{dt}}-\rho (a,t){\frac {da}{dt}}\\&=&\int _{a}^{b}{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}\,dx+\rho (b,t)u(b,t)-\rho (a,t)u(a,t)\\&=&\int _{a}^{b}\left[{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial }{\partial x}}(\rho u)\right]dx\end{array}}}

This integral being zero holds for all groups, that is, for all intervals



[
a
,
b
]


{\displaystyle [a,b]}
. The only way an integral can be zero for all intervals is if the integrand is zero for all



x


{\displaystyle x}
. Consequently, conservation derives the first order nonlinear conservation PDE

for all positions on the highway.
This conservation PDE applies not only to car traffic but also to fluids, solids, crowds, animals, plants, bushfires, financial traders, and so on.
