Another 8-bit code, known as the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) 
(pronounced ASS-KEY), was originally designed as a 7-bit code. Several computer manufacturers 
cooperated to develop this code for transmitting and processing data. The purpose was to standardize a 
binary code to give the computer user the capability of using several machines to process data regardless 
of the manufacturer: IBM, HONEYWELL, UNIVAC, BURROUGHS, and so on. However, since most 
computers are designed to handle (store and manipulate) 8-bit code, an 8-bit version of ASCII was 
developed. ASCII is commonly used in the transmission of data through data communications and is used 
almost exclusively to represent data internally in microcomputers.
