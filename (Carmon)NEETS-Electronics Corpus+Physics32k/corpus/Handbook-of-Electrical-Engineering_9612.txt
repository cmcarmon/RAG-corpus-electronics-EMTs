Security has become more important during recent years. Theft of data and unauthorized access to data are
prevented in secure systems. Within the United States, levels of security are deﬁned by a government-produced
. This document deﬁnes seven levels of security, denoted from lowest to
document known as the 
A1.
 Many operating systems provide no security and are labeled D. Most
highest as 
time-sharing systems are secure enough that they could be classiﬁed at the C1 level. The C2 and B1 levels are
similar, and this is where most secure operating systems are currently classiﬁed. During the 1990s B2 and B3
systems  will  become  readily  available  from  vendors.  The  A1  level  is  extremely  difﬁcult  to  achieve,  although
several such systems are being worked on.
