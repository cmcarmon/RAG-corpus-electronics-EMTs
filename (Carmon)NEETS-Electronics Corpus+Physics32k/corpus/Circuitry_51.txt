where  B is  the  flux  density  (in  Tesla),  µ0 is  the 
permeability of ‘free space’ (4A × 10(cid:1)7 or 12.57  ×
10(cid:1)7),  I is  the  current  (in  Amperes),  and  d is  the 
distance  from  the  centre  of  the  conductor  (in 
metres). 
  The  flux  density  is  also  equal  to  the  total  flux 
divided by the area of the field. Thus: 
 
B = 9 / A
