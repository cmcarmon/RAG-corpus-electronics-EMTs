Computer-Aided Design for Programmable Arrays
As programmable devices become more complex, the capabilities of the computer-aided design support become
more and more important. Small PLA and PAL devices can be programmed from a manually created table,
but  this  method  is  error-prone  and  cannot  be  recommended.  The  earliest  widely  available  design  aid  for
programmable logic was the compiler known as PALASM. This was able to translate the functional speciﬁcation
of a device, expressed in the form of Boolean equations, into the device programming speciﬁcation for a PAL
