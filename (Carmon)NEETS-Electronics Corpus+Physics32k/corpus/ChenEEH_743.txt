Energy Trade-Offs Between Concurrent Tasks
The performanceâ€“energy function can be used even better to
trade off cycles assigned to different tasks in a complex system.
Our Pareto curves should indeed be generated per concur-
rently executed task. It is then clearly visible that assigning
too few cycles to a single task causes the cost of the entire
system to increase. The Pareto curves also show the minimal
(realistic) cycle budget per task. The cycle and energy estimates
can clearly help the designer to assign concurrent tasks to
processors and to distribute the cycles in the processors over
the different tasks (see Figure 2.20). Minimizing the overall
energy in a heterogeneous multiprocessor is then possible by
applying Pareto function minimization on all the energy-cycle
functions together. Even when multiple tasks have to be
assigned to a single processor under control of an operating
