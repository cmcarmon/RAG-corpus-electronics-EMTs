DC high-current measurement 
 
In common  with  many simple  multi-range  meters, 
both  analogue  and  digital,  the  high  current  range 
(e.g.,  10  A)  is  not  only  selected  using  the  range 
selector  switch  but  a  separate  input  connection 
must  also  be  made.  The  reason  for  this  is  simply 
that  the  range  switch  and  associated  wiring  is  not 
designed to carry a high current. Instead, the high-
current  shunt  is  terminated  separately  at  its  own  
‘10 A’ socket. 
  Figure  14.11  shows  the  connections  and  range 
selector  settings 
to  permit  high-current  DC 
measurement. The range selector is set to DC 10 A 
and  the  red  and  black  test  leads  are  connected  to 
‘10 A’ and ‘O’ respectively. The pointer is reading 
mid-way between 9 and 10 on the range that has 10 
as  its  full-scale  indication.  The  actual  reading 
indicated is thus 9.5 A. 
 
AC voltage measurement 
 
Figure  14.12  shows  how  to  make  AC  voltage 
measurements.  Once  again,  the  red  and  black  test
