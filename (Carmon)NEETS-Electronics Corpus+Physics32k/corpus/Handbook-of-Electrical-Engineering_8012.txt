icroelectronics  has  been  the  most
signiﬁcant  area  of  development  in
electrical technology in recent years
and has had a profound effect on the course of
electrical  engineering.  The  integrated  circuit
was one of the major developments of its time.
The  increasing  complexity  of  electronic
devices  meant  that  even  transistorized  circuits
could be too large and heavy, especially for aero-
space applications. In addition, the reliability of
such circuits was limited by the ever-increasing
number of interconnections. The integrated cir-
cuit was a solution to both of these problems.
They actually changed the way electrical circuits
were  designed.  Engineers  had  grown  accus-
tomed to creating circuits with a minimum of
active components, since transistors and diodes
were  relatively  more  expensive  than  resistors
and capacitors. However, active components are
both smaller and easier to put on a silicon chip
than inactive ones. Thus, the circuits most adaptable to integration are digital circuits, with many active
components performing “yes-no” logic functions. Since these are the types of circuits used in computers,
it actually encouraged engineers to look for digital solutions to design problems.
