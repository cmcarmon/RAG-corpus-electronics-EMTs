Cart before the horse: Focusing too many resources on a stage of a project out of its sequence
Death march: A project whose staff, while expecting it to fail, are compelled to continue, often with much overwork, by management which is in denial
Ninety-ninety rule: Tendency to underestimate the amount of time to complete a project when it is "nearly done"
Overengineering: Spending resources making a project more robust and complex than is needed
Scope creep: Uncontrolled changes or continuous growth in a projectâ€™s scope, or adding new features to the project after the original requirements have been drafted and accepted (also known as requirement creep and feature creep)
Smoke and mirrors: Demonstrating unimplemented functions as if they were already implemented
Brooks' law: Adding more resources to a project to increase velocity, when the project is already slowed down by coordination overhead.
