larger  the  noise  margin  the  better  is  its  ability  to 
perform  in  an  environment  in  which  noise  is 
present.  Noise  margin  is  defined  as  the  difference 
between  the  minimum  values  of  high  state  output 
and  high  state  input  voltage  and  the  maximum 
values  of  low  state  output  and  low  state  input 
voltage. Hence: 
 
Noise margin = VOH(MIN) R VIH(MIN) 
or 
 
Noise margin = VOL(MAX) R VOH(MAX) 
where VOH(MIN) is the minimum value of high state 
(logic  1)  output  voltage,  VIH(MIN)  is  the  minimum 
value of high state (logic 1) input voltage, VOL(MAX) 
is the maximum value of low state (logic 0) output 
voltage, and VOH(MAX) is the maximum value of low 
state (logic 0) input voltage.
