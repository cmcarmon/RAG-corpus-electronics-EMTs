Thermal management issues remain major concerns in the successful design of an SMT board and product.
Consideration must be taken of the variables affecting both board temperature and junction temperature of
the IC. The reader is referred to Chapter 33 in this Handbook for the basics of Thermal Management, and to
Bar-Cohen and Kraus [1988] for a more detailed treatment on thermal issues affecting ICs and PCB design.
The design team must understand the basic heat transfer characteristics of most SMT IC packages [Capillo,
1993].  Since  the  silicon  chip  of  an  SMD  is  equivalent  to  the  chip  in  an  identical-function  DIP  package,  the
smaller SMD package means the internal lead frame metal has a smaller mass than the lead frame in a DIP
package. This lesser ability to conduct heat away from the chip is somewhat offset by the leadframe of many
SMDs being constructed of copper, which has a lower thermal resistance than the Kovar and Alloy 42 materials
