Diodes are the most widely used devices in low- and high-speed electronic circuits and in rectiﬁers and power
supplies. Other applications are in voltage regulators, detectors, and demodulators. Rectiﬁer diodes are capable
of conducting several hundred amperes in the forward direction and less than 1 mA in the reverse direction.
Zener diodes are ordinary diodes operated in the Zener or avalanche region and are used as voltage regulators.
Varactor diodes are ordinary diodes used in reverse biasing as voltage-dependent capacitors. Tunnel diodes and
quantum well devices have a negative differential resistance and are capable of operating in the upper gigahertz
region. Photodiodes are ordinary diodes operated in the reverse direction. They are sensitive to light and are
used as light sensors. Solar cells are diodes which convert light energy into electrical energy. Schottky diodes,
also known as metal-semiconductor diodes, are extremely fast because they are majority carrier devices.
