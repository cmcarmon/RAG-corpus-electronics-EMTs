Most hard disks are made of aluminum platters coated on both sides with either iron oxide or 
thin-film metal magnetic coatings. The first type, iron oxide, is the most common (you can recognize this 
coating by its rust color). This is the same oxide coating that's used on magnetic tape. The second type of 
coating, thin-film metal, is the newer and better of the two. This coating is a microscopic layer of metal 
that's bonded to the aluminum platter. You can recognize it by its shiny silver color. Thin-film 
metal-coated hard disks are becoming more and more popular because they allow more data to be stored 
in less space.
