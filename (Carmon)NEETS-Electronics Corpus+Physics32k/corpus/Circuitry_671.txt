respectively. The mode switch and range selectors 
are set to DC, 200 mA, and the display indicates a 
reading of 85.9 mA. 
 
DC high-current measurement 
 
In  common  with  simple  analogue  multi-range 
meters,  the  meter  uses  a  shunt  which  is  directly 
connected  to  a  separate  ‘10  A’  terminal.  Figure 
14.18  shows  the  connections,  mode  switch  and 
range  selector  settings  to  permit  high-current  DC 
measurement. The mode switch and range selectors 
are  set  to  DC,  2,000  mA  (2  A)  and  the  red  and 
black test leads are connected to ‘10 A’ and ‘COM’ 
respectively.  The  display  indicates  a  reading  of 
2.99 A. 
 
AC voltage measurement 
 
Figure  14.19  shows  how  to  make  AC  voltage 
measurements.  Once  again,  the  red  and  black  test 
leads  are  connected  to  the  ‘V-OHM’  and  ‘COM’ 
sockets respectively. In Fig. 14.19, the mode switch 
and  range  selectors  are  set  to  AC,  10  V,  and  the 
display indicates a reading of 1.736 V.
