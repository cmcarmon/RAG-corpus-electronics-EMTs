In a quiescent state, nerve and muscle cells maintain a membrane potential typically around –60 to –90 mV,
with the inside of the cell negative relative to the outside. Two ions that are involved in the electrical response

The membrane is semipermeable; that is, it is a lossy dielectric which allows the passage of certain ions. The
ionic permeability varies substantially from one ionic species to another. The ionic channels in the excitable
membrane will vary their permeability in response to the transmembrane potential; this property distinguishes
the excitable membrane from the ordinary cellular membrane, and it supports propagation of nerve impulses.
