This type of flow provides important information about flow in front part of streamlined body. It is probable that at the boundary, flow is not properly represented for real flow. The pressure and velocity of flow near to boundary layer is calculated by applying the Bernoulli's principle and is approximated with potential flow. The above equations may be used to calculate the stress on the body placed into the flow stream.
