Picture yourself standing between two very tempting dessert platters. You 
want to go for each of them, but can’t decide which to try first. You start 
out running toward one, but quickly change your mind and turn around and 
starting running toward the other. Then you change your mind again, so you 
turn and start racing toward the first one, and so forth. The faster you change 
your mind, the more you stay put in the middle — not getting anywhere (or 
any dessert). Those tempting desserts make you act like the electrons in an 
inductor when a high‐frequency signal is applied to the circuit: Neither you 
nor the electrons make any progress.
