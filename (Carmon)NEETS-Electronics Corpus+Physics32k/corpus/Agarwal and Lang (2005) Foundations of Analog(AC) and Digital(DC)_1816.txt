between second-order circuits containing two capacitors or two inductors, and
second-order circuits containing one capacitor and one inductor. That differ-
ence is that the latter circuits can exhibit under-damped oscillatory behavior,
while the former circuits cannot. That is, s1 and s2 are always real and non-
positive, for second-order circuits containing two independent capacitors or two
independent inductors. In fact, we can extend this statement, without proof,
to higher-order circuits as well.10 Circuits containing only resistors and capaci-
tors, or only resistors and inductors, will have characteristic equations with only
real non-positive roots. For this reason, such circuits can not oscillate. Rather,
their states may have only as many as Nâˆ’1 zero crossings where N is the order
of the circuit. The exact number of zero crossings actually depends upon the
initial conditions of the circuit.
