Automotive wind tunnels fall into two categories:
External flow tunnels are used to study the external flow through the chassis
Climatic tunnels are used to evaluate the performance of door systems, braking systems, etc. under various climatic conditions. Most of the leading automobile manufacturers have their own climatic wind tunnels
Wunibald Kamm built the first full-scale wind tunnel for motor vehicles.
For external flow tunnels various systems are used to compensate for the effect of the boundary layer on the road surface, including systems of moving belts under each wheel and the body of the car (5 or 7 belt systems) or one large belt under the entire car, or other methods of boundary layer control such as scoops or perforations to suck it away.
