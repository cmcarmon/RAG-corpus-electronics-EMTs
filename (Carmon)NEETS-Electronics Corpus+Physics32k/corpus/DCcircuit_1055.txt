You may have noticed that the procedure for calculating Thevenin resistance is identical
to the procedure for calculating Norton resistance: remove all power sources and determine
resistance between the open load connection points. As such, Thevenin and Norton resistances
for the same original network must be equal. Using the example circuits from the last two
sections, we can see that the two resistances are indeed equal:
