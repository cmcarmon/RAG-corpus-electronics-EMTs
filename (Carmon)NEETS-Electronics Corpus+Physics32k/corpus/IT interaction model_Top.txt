The IT interaction model is a holistic view of Management Information Systems in the context of the organization. According to Mark S. Silver, the model addresses the interaction of an information system's features with five elements of the organization.
Its external environment
Its strategy
Its structure and culture
Its business processes
Its IT infrastructure.
The model considers the consequences of this interaction for system use, for organizational performance, for the organization's personnel, and for the firm's future flexibility. Moreover, the model relates various aspects of the interaction process to the phases of the development and implementation lifecycles.
Tools such as Porter's five forces, value chain analysis and SWOT analysis can be used to analyze a company's strategy. Information flow diagrams can be used to analyze a company's business processes.
