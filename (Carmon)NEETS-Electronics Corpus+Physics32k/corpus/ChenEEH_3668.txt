Prosodic Features
Expressive uses of speech depend on tonal patterns of pitch,
syllable stresses, and timing to form rhythmic patterns. Timing
and rhythm contribute signiÔ¨Åcantly to the formal linguistic
structure of speech. The tonal and rhythmic aspects of speech,
called prosodic features, are created by special manipulations
of the speech production system during the normal sequence
of phoneme production. The glottal source excitation conveys
important prosodic cues such as intonation and stress. Stress
is used to distinguish similar phonetic sequences or to high-
light a syllable or word against a background of unstressed
syllables. Intonation refers to the distinctive use of patterns of
pitch. The same utterance, for example, can often be changed
intonation.
