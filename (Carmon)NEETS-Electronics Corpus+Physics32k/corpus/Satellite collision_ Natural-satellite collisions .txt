There have been no observed collisions between natural satellites of any Solar System planet or moon. Collision candidates for past events are:
Impact craters on many Jovian and Saturnian moons. They may have been formed by collisions with smaller moons, but they could equally likely have been formed by impacts with asteroids and comets during the Late Heavy Bombardment.
The far side of the Moon may have formed from the impact of a smaller moon that also formed during the giant impact event that created the Moon.
The objects making up the Rings of Saturn are believed to continually collide and aggregate with each other, leading to debris with limited size constrained to a thin plane. Although this is believed to be an ongoing process, this has not been directly observed.
