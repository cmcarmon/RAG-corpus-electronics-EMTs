And, as mentioned, some proportion of the sub-bandgap photons are not lost, but recirculated. However, the
power density produced by the silicon-based system will be quite small. The overall system efﬁciency is more
critically dependent on the efﬁciency of the spectral control components — the efﬁciency of recirculating the
unused  energy.  This  challenge  is  further  compounded  by  the  broad  bandwidth  needed  for  spectral  control.
Figure 60.20 plots the trade-off between conversion efﬁciency and power density for PV cells of various cut-
off wavelengths and a black-body emitter at 1700K. The calculations assume that 100% of the sub-bandgap
energy is usefully returned to the emitter. If this ﬁgure is reduced to 50%, the theoretical silicon-based system
efﬁciency will drop to under 10%, while the 0.7 eV system efﬁciency will fall to 25%. The power density is,
however, unaffected. The practical challenges in efﬁciently recirculating the sub-bandgap energies highlight the
importance of the development of low-bandgap TPV cells.
