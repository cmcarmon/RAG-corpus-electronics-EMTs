Application to Matrix Multiplication
We discuss here the application of integer mantissa checksums
to matrix multiplication; the description of this test for LU
decomposition can be found in work by Dutt and Assaad
(1996). Matrix multiplication is not mantissa preserving, since
it contains ï¬‚oating point additions. However, matrix multipli-
cation can be formulated as a composition of two functions, one
mantissa-preserving and the other not, as shown below.
