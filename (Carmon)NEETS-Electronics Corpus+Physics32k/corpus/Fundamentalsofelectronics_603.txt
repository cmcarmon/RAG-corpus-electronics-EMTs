Exercise 5.18
(Solution on p. 192.)
Before developing the FFT, let’s try to appreciate the algorithm’s impact. Suppose a short-length
transform takes 1 ms. We want to calculate a transform of a signal that is 10 times longer. Compare
how much longer a straightforward implementation of the DFT would take in comparison to an
FFT, both of which compute exactly the same quantity.
