The effect of a gate signal on the firing of an SCR is shown in figure 3-20. Breakdown of the center 
junction can be achieved at speeds approaching a microsecond by applying an appropriate signal to the 
gate lead, while holding the anode voltage constant. After breakdown, the voltage across the device is so 
low that the current through it from cathode to anode is essentially determined by the load it is feeding.
