If the floppy disks were used to store classified, or unclassified but sensitive information, they can't 
be de-classified by erasing them. This is because, with the right equipment and software, the data that was 
on the disk can be reconstructed. Floppy disks are cheap and easy to replace. If you can't re-use the floppy 
disks to store other classified data, just destroy them, using the procedures in OPNAVINST 5510.1, DON 
Information and Personnel Security Program Regulation.
