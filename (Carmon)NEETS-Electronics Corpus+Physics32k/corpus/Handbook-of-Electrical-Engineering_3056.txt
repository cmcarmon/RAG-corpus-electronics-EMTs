Many commercial IC active ﬁlters are based on SC techniques, and it is also becoming usual to ﬁnd custom
and semicustom IC design systems that include active ﬁlter modules as components within a macrocell library
that the system-level design can simply invoke where analog ﬁltering is required within an all-analog or mixed-
signal analog/digital system.
