Felix Arnold Edward Pirani (2 February 1928 â€“ 31 December 2015) was a British theoretical physicist specialising in gravitational physics and general relativity.  Pirani and Herman Bondi wrote a series of articles (1959 to 1989) that established the existence of plane wave solutions for gravitational waves based on general relativity.
During the last half of the 20th century Pirani was politically active, studied disarmament and advocated the responsible use of science.
