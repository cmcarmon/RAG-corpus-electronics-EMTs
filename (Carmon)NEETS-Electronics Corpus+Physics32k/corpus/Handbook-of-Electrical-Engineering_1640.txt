Minimax estimate:  The optimum estimate for the least favorable prior distribution.
Nonhomogeneous linear estimator: An estimator which is a nonhomogeneous linear function of the data.
Nonlinear MS estimate:  The optimum estimate under the mean-square performance criterion.
Nonparametric estimation:  An estimation scheme in which no parametric description of the statistical model
