In the design of high-performance vehicles, a nolder of limited size can significantly increase or decrease the lift (Cz) of a vehicle's aerodynamic profile.
Nolders are also used in less high-performance applications, for example forcing an airflow separation alongside a vertical rear window to minimize debris accumulation, e.g., with a small hatchback.
