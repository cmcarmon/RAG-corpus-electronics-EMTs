It was studied by Allen Hazen that the coefficient of permeability (k) of a soil is directly proportional to the square of the particle size (D). Thus [Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of coarse grained soil is very large as compared to that of fine grained soil. The permeability of coarse sand may be more than one million times as much that of clay.
