Ensemble Processors
 PEs (a PE
An ensemble system is an extension of the conventional uniprocessor systems. It is a collection of

networks. When the need for communication arises, it is done through the CU. This slows down the system
for applications requiring extensive interprocessor and processor-memory communications. For example, the
 PEs are available in an ensemble processor,
sum of two matrices A and B can be executed in one step, if 
 is the rank of the matrices. On the other hand, the product of the same two matrices requires extensive

data alignment between the elements of A and B. As a result, it is ineffective for performing matrix multipli-
cations with an ensemble processor. Therefore, while the ensemble processors are capable of executing up to
N
  identical  jobs  simultaneously,  they  have  very  limited  applications.  Parallel  element  processing  ensemble
(PEPE) [Evensen and Troy, 1973] is an example of such parallel processors.
