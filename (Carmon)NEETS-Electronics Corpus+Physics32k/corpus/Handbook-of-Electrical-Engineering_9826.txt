Figure  100.9  presents  a  ﬂowchart  of  the  frequency  response  method  design  process  and  indicates  the  key
role  of  analysis  in  linear  systems  control  design.  The  ﬂowchart  of  Fig.  100.9  is  applicable  to  control  system
design  methods  in  general.  There  are  several  iterative  loops,  generally  calling  for  trial-and-error  efforts,  that
comprise the suggested design process. An experienced designer will often be able, primarily due to successful
prior experience, to select a system structure and generic components such that the design speciﬁcations can
be met with no or perhaps a very few iterations through the iterative loop involving adjustment of equalizer
or compensation parameters to best meet speciﬁcations.
