Using matrix boards and stripboards 
 
Matrix boards and stripboards are ideal for simple 
prototype 
circuit 
construction.  The  distinction  between  matrix 
boards and stripboards is simply that the former has 
no copper tracks and the user has to make extensive 
use  of  press-fit  terminal  pins  which  are  used  for 
component  connection.  Extensive  inter-wiring  is 
then  necessary to link terminal pins together. This 
may  be  carried  out  using  sleeved  tinned  copper 
wire  (of  appropriate  gauge)  or  short  lengths  of 
PVC-insulated ‘hook-up’ or equipment wire.
