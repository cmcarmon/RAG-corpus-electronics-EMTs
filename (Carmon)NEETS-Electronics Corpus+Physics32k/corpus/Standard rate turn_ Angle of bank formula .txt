The formula for calculating the angle of bank for a specific true airspeed (TAS) in meters per second is:

{\displaystyle {\text{Bank}}=\tan ^{-1}\left({\frac {{\text{TAS}}^{2}/r}{g}}\right)}

where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the turn in meters, and



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity in m·s−2.
For a rate one turn and velocity in knots (nautical miles per hour), this comes to

{\displaystyle {\text{Bank}}=\tan ^{-1}\left({\frac {{\text{TAS}}\ {\text{(kn)}}}{364}}\right)}

A convenient approximation for the bank angle in degrees is

{\displaystyle {\text{Bank}}\;{\text{(degrees)}}\approx {\frac {{\text{TAS}}\ {\text{(kn)}}}{10}}+7}

For aircraft holding purposes, ICAO mandates that all turns should be made, "at a bank angle of 25° or at a rate of 3° per second, whichever requires the lesser bank." By the above formula, a rate one turn at a TAS greater than 180 knots would require a bank angle of more than 25 degrees. Therefore, faster aircraft just use 30 degrees for their turns.
