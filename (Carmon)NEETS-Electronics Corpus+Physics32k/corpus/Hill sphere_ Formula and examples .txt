If the mass of the smaller body (e.g. Earth) is



m


{\displaystyle m}
, and it orbits a heavier body (e.g. Sun) of mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
with a semi-major axis



a


{\displaystyle a}
and an eccentricity of



e


{\displaystyle e}
, then the radius




r

{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {H} }}
of the Hill sphere of the smaller body (e.g. Earth) calculated at pericenter is, approximately

(

{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {H} }\approx a(1-e){\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {m}{3M}}}.}

When eccentricity is negligible (the most favourable case for orbital stability), this becomes

{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {H} }\approx a{\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {m}{3M}}}.}

In the Earth example, the Earth (5.97×1024 kg) orbits the Sun (1.99×1030 kg) at a distance of 149.6 million km, or one astronomical unit (AU). The Hill sphere for Earth thus extends out to about 1.5 million km (0.01 AU). The Moon's orbit, at a distance of 0.384 million km from Earth, is comfortably within the gravitational sphere of influence of Earth and it is therefore not at risk of being pulled into an independent orbit around the Sun. All stable satellites of the Earth (those within the Earth's Hill sphere) must have an orbital period shorter than seven months.
The previous (eccentricity-ignoring) formula can be re-stated as follows:

{\displaystyle 3{\frac {r_{\mathrm {H} }^{3}}{a^{3}}}\approx {\frac {m}{M}}.}

This expresses the relation in terms of the volume of the Hill sphere compared with the volume of the second body's orbit around the first; specifically, the ratio of the masses is three times the ratio of the volume of these two spheres. The expression for the Hill radius can be found by equating gravitational and centrifugal forces acting on a test particle (of mass much smaller than



m


{\displaystyle m}
) orbiting the secondary body. Assume that the distance between masses



M


{\displaystyle M}
and



m


{\displaystyle m}
is



r


{\displaystyle r}
, and that the test particle is orbiting at a distance




r


H





{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {H} }}
from the secondary. When the test particle is on the line connecting the primary and the secondary body, the force balance requires that

{\displaystyle \Omega ={\sqrt {\frac {GM}{r^{3}}}}}

{\displaystyle {\frac {r_{\mathrm {H} }}{r}}\approx {\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {m}{3M}}}.}

Notice that, if the orbit of the secondary about the primary is elliptical, the Hill radius is maximum at the apocenter, where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is largest, and minimum at the pericenter of the orbit. Therefore, for purposes of stability of test particles (for example, of small satellites), the Hill radius at the pericenter distance needs to be considered. To leading order in




r

/

r


{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {H} }/r}
, the Hill radius above also represents the distance of the Lagrangian point L1 from the secondary.
A quick way of estimating the radius of the Hill sphere comes from replacing mass with density in the above equation:

where
