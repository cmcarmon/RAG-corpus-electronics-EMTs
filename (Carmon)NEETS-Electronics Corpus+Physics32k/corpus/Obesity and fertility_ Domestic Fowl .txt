Domestic fowl has previously been researched on and it was found that by over feeding but not force feeding the male birds, there was no impact on fertility. However, more recently a study has shown that obesity induced by force feeding can have an impact on the number of spermatozoa and their motility in the male birds. It was also found that in two of the three birds, there was an decrease in testosterone and an increase in LH which suggests the pathway of why there might be reduced spermatozoa.
