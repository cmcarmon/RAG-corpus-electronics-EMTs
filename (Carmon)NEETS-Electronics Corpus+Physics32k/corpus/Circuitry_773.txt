Finally,  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  16.32  can  be 
used  where 
conventional  moving-coil 
loudspeaker is to be used in preference to a piezo-
electric  transducer.  This  circuit  is  again  based  on 
the 555 timer and provides a continuous output at 
approximately 1 kHz whenever the port output is at 
logic 1.
