Diaphragm  attached  to  a  coil  is  suspended  in  a  magnetic 
field.  Current  in  the  coil  causes  movement  of  the 
diaphragm  which  alternately  compresses  and  rarefies  the 
air mass in front of it. 
Metallic  conductor  is  wound  onto  a  ceramic  or  mica 
former. Current flowing in the conductor produces heat.
