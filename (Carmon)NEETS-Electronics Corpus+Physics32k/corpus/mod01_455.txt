The Ohmâ€™s law equation and its various forms may be obtained readily with the aid of figure 3-5.
The circle containing E, I, and R is divided into two parts, with E above the line and with I and R below
the line. To determine the unknown quantity, first cover that quantity with a finger. The position of the
uncovered letters in the circle will indicate the mathematical operation to be performed. For example, to
find I, cover I with a finger. The uncovered letters indicate that E is to be divided by R, or
