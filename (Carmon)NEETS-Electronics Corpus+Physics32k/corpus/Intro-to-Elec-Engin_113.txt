Multimeters that measure multiple ranges of voltage and current are available in practice.
Ohmmeters measure the dc resistance by the use of Ohmâ€™s law. A multimeter with scales for
volts, ohms, and milliamperes is known as VOM. An ohmmeter should not be used to measure
the resistance of an electronic component that might be damaged by the sensing current.
