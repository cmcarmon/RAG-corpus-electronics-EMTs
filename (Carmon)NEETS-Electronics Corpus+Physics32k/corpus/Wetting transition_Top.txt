A wetting transition (Cassieâ€“Wenzel transition) may occur during the process of wetting of a solid (or liquid) surface with a liquid. The transition corresponds to a certain change in contact angle, the macroscopic parameter characterizing wetting. Various contact angles can co-exist on the same solid substrate. Wetting transitions may occur in a different way depending on whether the surface is flat or rough.
