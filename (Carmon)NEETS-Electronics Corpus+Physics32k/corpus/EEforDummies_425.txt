Most smaller capacitors (such as 0.1 μF or 0.01 μF mica disc capacitors) use 
a three‐digit marking system to indicate capacitance. Most folks find the 
numbering system easy to use. But there’s a catch! (There’s always a catch.) 
The system is based on picofarads, not microfarads. A number using this 
marking system, such as 103, means 10, followed by three zeros, as in 10,000, 
for a total of 10,000 picofarads. Some capacitors are printed with a two‐digit 
number, which is simply its value in picofarads. For instance, a value of 22 
means 22 picofarads. No third digit means no zeros to tag on to the end.
