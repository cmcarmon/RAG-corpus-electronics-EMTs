Without gated agc, a large jamming signal would cause the automatic gain control to follow the
interfering signal. This would decrease the target return signal amplitude to an unusable value. Gated agc
produces an output signal for only short time periods; therefore, the agc output voltage must be averaged
over several cycles to keep the automatic gain control from becoming unstable.
