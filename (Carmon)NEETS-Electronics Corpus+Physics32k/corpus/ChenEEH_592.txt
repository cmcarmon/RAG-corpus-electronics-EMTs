Apart from channel resistance, on-resistance of the MOSFET
has contributions from the neck region between the p-wells
and spreading resistance in the drift region. Various structures
have been designed to reduce the on-resistance toward the
ideal
limit. Two notable device structures are the trench
MOSFET and the lateral MOSFET shown in Figure 7.15. The
trench MOSFET ensures a nearly one-dimensional current
ﬂow and eliminates the neck region. This structure also
achieves a much lower cell size and higher packing density.
Two of the major markets where power MOSFETs are ﬁnding
increasing use are portable electronics and automotive appli-
cations. In such applications, the power MOSFET must be
integrated with other circuit elements for logic-controlled or
analog applications. This requires all terminals to be available
at the top surface for integration. The lateral MOSFET, shown
in Figure 7.15(B) satisﬁes this requirement.
