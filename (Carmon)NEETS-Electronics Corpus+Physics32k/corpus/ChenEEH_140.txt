Figure 3.6. The ﬁnal value V2 ¼ 0:6823 V is reached at about
t ¼ 8 s. Note that the ﬁnal value is the same as that obtained in
the dc solution above.
Choosing a large step size h ¼ 10 s and calculating the time
response will give the results V2(10) ¼ 0:6697 V, V2(20) ¼
0:6816 V, V2(30) ¼ 0:6823 V, . . . . Note that even though
the result at t ¼ 10 s is not accurate, the error does not
grow with each time step and the correct value is reached
after a few more steps. Such time domain integration
methods are called stable and are preferred over the Euler
Forward method that may not give correct results for large
time steps.
