Suppose, now, that we wish to find the first-stage output voltage vo in
response to vi, a small sinusoidal signal applied to the input of the amplifier. In
particular, we are interested in determining how the presence of the capacitor
CGS affects the amplification afforded by the first amplifier stage. Suppose,
further, that we do not care about initial transients, rather, we are interested
in the steady-state behavior when all transients have died out. Experimental
application of a sinusoid to the input and measurement of the response vo will
show very different behavior as the frequency of the input is swept from a low
to a high value. We will observe that for low-frequency signals the gain of the
first stage is no different from our earlier calculations in Chapter 8 in the absence
of the capacitor CGS. However, we will also observe that the presence of the
capacitor makes the gain of the amplifier fall off rapidly at high frequencies.
