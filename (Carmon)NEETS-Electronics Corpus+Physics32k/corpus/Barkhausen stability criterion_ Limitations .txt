Barkhausen's criterion applies to linear circuits with a feedback loop. Therefore, it cannot be applied directly to one port negative resistance active elements like tunnel diode oscillators. The kernel of the criterion is that a complex pole pair must be placed on the imaginary axis of the complex frequency plane if steady state oscillations should take place. In the real world, it is impossible to balance on the imaginary axis so a steady-state oscillator must be a nonlinear circuit.
