v2 Acting Alone
Figure 3.54 shows the circuit corresponding to v2 acting alone. vo2 is the correspond-
ing response. In this circuit, since v1 = 0, we find that i1 = 0.
Since i1 = 0, there is no voltage drop across the resistor RL connected to node a, and
so, this time around, node a will be at ground potential. In other words,
