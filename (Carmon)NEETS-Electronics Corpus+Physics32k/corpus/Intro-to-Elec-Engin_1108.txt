As slip increases, the rotor impedance increases because of the increasing effect of rotor-
leakage inductance; the rotor current is then somewhat less than proportional to slip. The rotor
current lags further behind the induced voltage, and the rotor mmf wave lags further behind the
resultant ﬂux wave, so that sin δr decreases. The torque increases with increasing values of slip
up to a point and then decreases, as shown in Figure 13.1.6 for the motor region. The maximum
torque that the machine can produce is sometimes referred to as the breakdown torque, because it
limits the short-time overload capability of the motor. Higher starting torque can be obtained by
inserting external resistances in the rotor circuit, as is usually done in the case of the wound-rotor
induction motor. These resistances can be cut out for the normal running conditions in order to
operate the machine with a higher efﬁciency. Recall that a synchronous motor has no starting
torque. It is usually provided with a damper or amortisseur winding located in the rotor pole
faces. Such a winding acts like a squirrel-cage winding to make the synchronous motor start as an
induction motor and come up almost to synchronous speed, with the dc ﬁeld winding unexcited. If
the load and inertia are not too large, the motor will pull into synchronism and act as a synchronous
motor when the ﬁeld winding is energized from a dc source.
