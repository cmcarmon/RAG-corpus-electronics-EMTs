Determine the voltage vO for the MOSFET circuit shown in Figure 7.18. You are given
that both MOSFETs operate in the saturation region. The MOSFETs are identical and
are characterized by these parameter values: K = 4 mA / V2 and VT = 1 V.
Since we are told that both MOSFETs operate in the saturation region, and since iDS
for both MOSFETs is the same, their respective gate-to-source voltages must also be
equal. Recall that the drain-to-source current according to the SCS model is independent
