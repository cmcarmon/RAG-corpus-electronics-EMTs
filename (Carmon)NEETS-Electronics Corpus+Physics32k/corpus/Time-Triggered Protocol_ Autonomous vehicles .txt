The two Red Team robotic vehicles competing in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge were implemented with "drive-by-wire" technology, in which on-board computers controlled steering, braking and other movements. Three TTP-based TTC 200 units controlled the parking brake and throttle and transmission functions, and one TTP-By-Wire Box controlled the service brake of the H1 Hummer H1ghlander. Drive-by-wire modifications controlled the acceleration, braking and shifting of the Sandstorm.
