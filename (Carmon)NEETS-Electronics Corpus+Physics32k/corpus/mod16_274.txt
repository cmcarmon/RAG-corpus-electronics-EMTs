Semiconductor diodes, such as general-purpose germanium and silicon diodes, power silicon diodes,
and microwave silicon diodes, can be tested effectively under actual operating conditions. However,
crystal-rectifier testers are available to determine dc characteristics that provide an indication of crystal-
diode quality.
