Ground reaction forces (GRF) are exerted by the ground on the body in contact with it and reflect the bodyâ€™s acceleration. During level running, ground reaction forces can be dichotomized into vertical ground reaction forces and horizontal ground reaction forces. In the comparison of incline to level running, the terms normal and parallel ground reaction forces are substituted for vertical and horizontal because when running on an incline the latter terms become inaccurate in describing the direction of force application. Measurements are expressed as a percentage of body weight, where a value of one body weight is the force exerted to support the body when standing. A plot of normal GRF is characterized by its biphasic nature, with an initial impact peak corresponding to the braking portion of the stance phase (heal strike) followed by a larger peak representing the propulsion part of the stance phase (toe off). Typical parallel GRF application during running involves two peaks, one that is negative during breaking and one that is positive during propulsion. Important characteristics of a GRF plot are the magnitude of the peaks (impact and active), the rate of loading, average force, and the total area under the plot.
During level running at a speed of 3meters per second the vertical ground reaction force reaches a peak of approximately 2.5 times BW. Data on normal GRF during incline running has been sparse because of challenges in force platform construction. Gottschall and Kram (2004) mounted a force treadmill on wedges of varying inclines and found that compared to level running, the initial impact peak was decreased at 3, 6, and 9 degrees of inline. They also found that the braking parallel GRF was absent at 9 degrees of incline in addition to a 75% increase in the propulsive parallel GRF. Tehlan, however, did not find a blunted impact peak with incline running at 4 degrees.
