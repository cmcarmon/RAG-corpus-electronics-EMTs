In the proportional control algorithm, the controller output is proportional to the error signal, which is the difference between the setpoint and the process variable. In other words, the output of a proportional controller is the multiplication product of the error signal and the proportional gain.
This can be mathematically expressed as,





P


o
u
t



=

K

p




e
(
t
)
+
p
0



{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {out} }=K_{p}\,{e(t)+p0}}

where




p
0


{\displaystyle p0}
: Controller output with zero error.





P


o
u
t





{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {out} }}
: Output of the proportional controller





K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
: Proportional gain




e
(
t
)


{\displaystyle e(t)}
: Instantaneous process error at time t.



e
(
t
)
=
S
P
−
P
V


{\displaystyle e(t)=SP-PV}

SP: Set point
PV: Process variable
Constraints: In a real plant, actuators have physical limitations that can be expressed as constraints on




P


o
u
t





{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {out} }}
. For example,




P


o
u
t





{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {out} }}
may be bounded between −1 and +1 if those are the maximum output limits.
Qualifications: It is preferable to express




K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
as a unitless number. To do this, we can express



e
(
t
)


{\displaystyle e(t)}
as a ratio with the span of the instrument. This span is in the same units as error (e.g. C degrees) so the ratio has no units.
