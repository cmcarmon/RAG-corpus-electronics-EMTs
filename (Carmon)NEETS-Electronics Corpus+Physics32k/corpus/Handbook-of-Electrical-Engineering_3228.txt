Converter-controlled  electrical  machine  drives  are  very  important  in  modern  industrial  applications.  Some
examples  in  the  high-power  range  are  metal  rolling  mills,  cement  mills,  and  gas  line  compressors.  In  the
medium-power range are textile mills, paper mills, and subway car propulsion. Machine tools and computer
peripherals are examples of converter-controlled electrical machine drive applications in the low-power range.
The  converter  normally  provides  a  variable-voltage  dc  power  source  for  a  dc  motor  drive  and  a  variable-
frequency, variable-voltage ac power source for an ac motor drive. The drive system efÔ¨Åciency is high because
the converter operates in switching mode using power semiconductor devices. The primary control variable of
the  machine  may  be  torque,  speed,  or  position,  or  the  converter  can  operate  as  a  solid-state  starter  of  the
machine. The recent evolution of high-frequency power semiconductor devices and high-density and econom-
ical  microelectronic  chips,  coupled  with  converter  and  control  technology  developments,  is  providing  a  tre-
mendous boost in the applications of drives.
