The Bohrâ€“van Leeuwen theorem proves that there cannot be any diamagnetism or paramagnetism in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic moments of the ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.
