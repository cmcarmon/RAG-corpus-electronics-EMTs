Milton Friedman criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on 'models of imaginary worlds' rather than 'generalizations about the real world', making the claims of the model immune to falsification. He also criticized the model on logical grounds, by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state: any time an individual started a private enterprise, the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.
