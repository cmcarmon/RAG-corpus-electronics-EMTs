Motion-Compensated Predictive Coding
Signiﬁcant improvements in image quality, at a ﬁxed compression rate, can be obtained when adaptive predic-
tion algorithms take into account the frame-to-frame displacement of moving objects in the sequence. Alter-
natively, one could increase the compression rate for a ﬁxed level of image quality. The amount of increase in
performance will depend on one’s ability to estimate the motion in the scene. Techniques for estimating the
motion are described in a later subsection.
