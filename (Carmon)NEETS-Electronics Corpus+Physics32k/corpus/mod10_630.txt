To plot this pattern, we will assume that the radiation is measured on a scale of 0 to 10 units and that 
the measured amount of radiation is 7 units at all points. We will then plot our measurements on two 
different types of graphs, rectangular- and polar-coordinate graphs. The RECTANGULAR-
COORDINATE GRAPH of the measured radiation, shown in view A of figure 4-10, is a straight line 
plotted against positions along the circle. View B shows the POLAR-COORDINATE GRAPH for the 
same isotropic source.
