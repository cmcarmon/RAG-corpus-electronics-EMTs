This table lists sample values of L1, L2, and L3 within the solar system. Calculations assume the two bodies orbit in a perfect circle with separation equal to the semimajor axis and no other bodies are nearby. Distances are measured from the larger body's center of mass with L3 showing a negative location. The percentage columns show how the distances compare to the semimajor axis. E.g. for the Moon, L1 is located 326400 km from Earth's center, which is 84.9% of the Earth-Moon distance or 15.1% in front of the Moon; L2 is located 448900 km from Earth's center, which is 116.8% of the Earth-Moon distance or 16.8% beyond the Moon; and L3 is located âˆ’381700 km from Earth's center, which is 99.3% of the Earth-Moon distance or 0.7084% in front of the Moon's 'negative' position. The L3 percent value has been magnified by 100.
