According to the principles of Doppler cooling, an atom modelled as a two-level atom can be cooled using a laser. If it moves in a specific direction and encounters a counter-propagating laser beam resonant with its transition, it is very likely to absorb a photon. The absorption of this photon gives the atom a "kick" in the direction that is consistent with momentum conservation and brings the atom to its excited state. However, this state is unstable and some time later the atom decays back to its ground state via spontaneous emission (after a time on the order of nanoseconds, for example in Rubidium 87 the excited state of the D2 transition has a lifetime of 26.2 ns). The photon will be reemitted (and the atom will again increase its speed), but its direction will be random. When averaging over a large number of these processes applied to one atom, one sees that the absorption process decreases the speed always in the same direction (as the absorbed photon comes from a monodirectional source), whereas the emission process does not lead to any change in the speed of the atom because the emission direction is random. Thus the atom is being effectively slowed down by the laser beam.
There is nevertheless a problem in this basic scheme because of the Doppler effect. The resonance of the atom is rather narrow (on the order of a few megaHertz), and after having decreased its momentum by a few recoil momenta, it is no longer in resonance with the pump beam because in its frame, the frequency of the laser has shifted. The Zeeman slower uses the fact that a magnetic field can change the resonance frequency of an atom using the Zeeman effect to tackle this problem.

, then after absorbing a photon and moving to the excited state, the atom would then preferentially re-emit a photon in the direction of the laser beam (due to stimulated emission) which would counteract the slowing process.
