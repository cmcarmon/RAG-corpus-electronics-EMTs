An electromagnet is composed of many turns of 
wire close together. This allows the flux lines to add 
together when a current flows through the wire. The 
more turns of wire, the more flux lines are added 
together. Also, the greater the current, the greater  
the number of flux lines generated. The strength of 
the magnetic field, then, is directly proportional to the 
number of turns in the coil and the amount of current 
flowing through it.
