An impact winter would have a devastating effect on humans, as well as the other species on Earth. With the sun's radiation being severely diminished the first thing to go would be plants and animals who survive through the process of photosynthesis. This lack of food would ultimately lead to other mass extinctions of other animals that are higher up on the food chain, and possibly cause up to 25% of the human population to perish. Depending on location and size of the initial impact, the cost of clean-up efforts could be so high as to cause an economic crisis for the survivors. These factors would make life on Earth, for humans, extremely difficult.
