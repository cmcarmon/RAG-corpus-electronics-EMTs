Motion Compensation
In generating the synthetic aperture, the signal processing
assumes that the radar ï¬‚ies along a straight line at constant
speed. Practically, the vehicle carrying the antenna may be
subjected to deviation from linear motion. Motion compen-
sation is to compensate the phase of the received signal for the
displacement of real antenna motion from the position of the
ideal SAR being generated.
