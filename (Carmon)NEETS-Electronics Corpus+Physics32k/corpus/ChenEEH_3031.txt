In a three-wire, three-phase system, let the rms voltage be-
tween each wire and the ground (the ground is often a
grounded wire, making it a four-wire system) be V 0, the
current in each wire be I, and the phase angle between the
two be f. Because there are three phases, the total power
transmitted is as follows:
