In theoretical physics, the issue of route dependence deals with whether a selected differential between two points is taken as absolute, or as being partly a function of the route along which comparative measurements are taken. It usually applies in discussions of gravitational potential or related effects such as gravitational redshift.
In simpler exercises in gravitational physics, it is common to invoke gravitational potential as an absolute difference between two positions that does not depend on the route, and to invoke energy conservation as a reason why the energy gained or lost when an object moves between two defined states is fixed, independent of the route taken.
In more advanced gravitational theory, things are not so straightforward: the nominal gravitational potential between two positions often has to be supplemented with route-dependent effects, or defined in a route-dependent manner.
