In dynamical systems, if the dynamic is given by a differentiable map f then a point is hyperbolic if and only if the differential of Æ’ n (where n is the period of the point) has no eigenvalue on the (complex) unit circle when computed at the point. Then a saddle point is a hyperbolic periodic point whose stable and unstable manifolds have a dimension that is not zero.
A saddle point of a matrix is an element which is both the largest element in its column and the smallest element in its row.
