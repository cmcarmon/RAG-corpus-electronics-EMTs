Morse code 
 
Transmitters  and  receivers  for  CW  operation  are 
extremely  simple  but  nevertheless  they  can  be 
extremely  efficient.  This  makes  them  particularly 
useful for disaster and emergency communications 
or  for  any  situation  that  requires  optimum  use  of 
low power equipment. Signals are transmitted using 
the code invented by Samuel Morse (see Fig. 13.5). 
 The Morse code uses a combination of dots (short 
periods of transmission) and dashes (slightly longer 
periods of transmission) to represent characters. As 
an  example,  Fig.  13.6  shows  how  the  radio 
frequency carrier is repeatedly switched on and off 
to transmit the character ‘C’.
