The output across the resistor in an RC circuit of a medium time constant is shown in figure 4-41. 
The value of the variable resistor has been increased to a value of 10,000 ohms. This means that the time 
constant of the circuit is equal to the duration of the input pulse or 100 microseconds. For clarity, the 
voltage waveforms developed across both the resistor and the capacitor are shown. As before, the sum of 
the voltages across the resistor and capacitor must be equal to the applied voltage of 100 volts.
