Diodes are like one‐way valves, allowing current to flow in one direction only. 
If you insert a diode backward in a circuit, either your circuit won’t work 
because no current will flow or you may damage some components if you 
exceed the peak reverse voltage (PRV) and allow current to flow in reverse — 
which can damage components such as electrolytic capacitors. Always note 
the orientation of the diode when you use it in a circuit, double‐checking to 
make sure you have it right!
