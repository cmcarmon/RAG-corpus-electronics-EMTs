Many factors affect a radio wave in its path between the transmitting and receiving sites. The factor 
that has the greatest adverse effect on radio waves is ABSORPTION. Absorption results in the loss of 
energy of a radio wave and has a pronounced effect on both the strength of received signals and the 
ability to communicate over long distances.
