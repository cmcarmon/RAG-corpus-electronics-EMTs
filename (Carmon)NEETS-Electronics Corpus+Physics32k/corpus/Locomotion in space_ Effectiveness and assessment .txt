The TVIS and iRED are largely ineffective when it comes to maintaining muscle volume and bone density. Both the TVIS and the iRED cannot generate forces that are similar to those experienced on Earth. The harnesses and bungee cords used in many of these device cause substantial discomfort, and in the future need to be redesigned for ease of long-duration use. The CEVIS, at its maximal setting, is the only device that can achieve resistive loads that are comparable to Earth.
The European Space Agency employs many different devices to assess the effectiveness of different countermeasure technologies:
Muscle Atrophy Research and Exercise System (MARES)
Portable Pulmonary Function System (PPFS)
Earlobe Arterialised Blood Collector (EAB C)
Long-Term Medical Survey System (LTMS)
ISS-compatible X-Ray Imaging System
Biofeedback and Virtual-reality systems: Enhanced Virtual-Reality System (eVRS)
