We assume that the receiver has knowledge of the starting
and ending times of each transmitted pulse; in other words,
the receiver has prior knowledge of the pulse shape but not its
polarity. Given the noisy signal, the receiver has to make a
decision in each signaling interval as to whether the transmit-
ted symbol is 1 or 0.
We refer to Figure 3.1 step 1 involves reducing the received
waveform to a single number z(t ¼ T ). This operation can be
performed by a linear ﬁlter followed by a sampler or optimally
by a matched ﬁlter. The initial conditions of the ﬁlter are set
to zero just before the arrival of each new symbol. At the end of a
symbol duration T , the output of step 1 yields the sample z(T ):
