Operating systems can communicate with a process by
sending a signal to the process. The signal causes the process
to temporarily suspend whatever it is doing, save its registers
on the stack, and start running a special signal handling pro-
cedure. Then the signal handler is done, and the running
process is resumed. Signals are the software analog of hardware
interrupts and can be generated by a variety of causes, such as
timers expiring, execution of an illegal instruction, and use of
an invalid address. Signals are also used for process-to-process
communication, when one process wants to communicate
something to another.
