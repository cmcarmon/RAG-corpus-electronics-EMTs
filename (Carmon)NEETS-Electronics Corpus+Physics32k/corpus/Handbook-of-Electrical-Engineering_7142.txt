A  complete  transponder  link  analysis  must  include  the  contributions  of  the  uplink,  downlink,  and  also  the
power sum of all interference signals due, for example, to intermodulation products generated in the output
stages of the ampliÔ¨Åers, external interference from other systems, and intra-system interference from reusing
the same frequency band on spatially isolated or dual-polarized antenna beams to increase communications
capacity. For most applications the total interference power may be taken as the power sum of interfering signals
as long as they are not correlated with each other or the desired carrier. The values for the interfering signals
due  to,  for  example,  frequency  reuse  cross-polarization,  multiple  beam  interferers,  and  interference  power
received from other systems, must be obtained by carefully constructing the link equation for each case, taking
into account the antenna gains for each polarization and beam direction of concern.
