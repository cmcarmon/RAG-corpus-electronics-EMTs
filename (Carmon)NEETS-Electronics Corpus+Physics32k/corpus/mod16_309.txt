In the figure, only one turn of wire is shown; however, in an actual meter movement, many turns of
fine wire would be used, each turn adding more effective length to the coil. The coil is wound on an
aluminum frame (bobbin) to which the pointer is attached. Oppositely wound hairsprings (only one is
shown in the figure) are also attached to the bobbin, one at either end. The circuit to the coil is completed
through the hairsprings. In addition to serving as conductors, the hairsprings serve as the restoring force
that returns the pointer to the zero position when no current flows.
