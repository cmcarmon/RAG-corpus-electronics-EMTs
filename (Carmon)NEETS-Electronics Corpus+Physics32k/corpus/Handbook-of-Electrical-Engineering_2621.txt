From Eqs. (24.35) and (24.38), the threshold voltage depends upon the implanted dopant-ion proﬁle only
through two parameters, the net charge introduced by the implant in the region between the inversion layer
and the depletion-layer edge qDI, and the centroid of this portion of the implanted charge  x C. As a result, a
variety of implants can result in the same threshold, ranging from the extreme of a d-function spike implant
of dose DI/unit area located at the centroid xC, to a box-type rectangular distribution with the same dose and
centroid, namely, a rectangular distribution of width xW = 2xC and volume density DI/xW. (Of course, xW must
be no larger than the depletion-layer width at threshold for this equivalence to hold true, and xC must not lie
within the inversion layer.) This weak dependence on the details of the proﬁle leaves ﬂexibility to satisfy other
requirements, such as control of off current.
