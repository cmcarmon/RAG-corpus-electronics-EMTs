Mica Capacitors
Mica capacitors have small capacitance values and are usually used in high-frequency circuits. They are con-
structed as alternate layers of metal foil and mica insulation, which are stacked and encapsulated, or are silvered
mica, where a silver electrode is screened on the mica insulators.
