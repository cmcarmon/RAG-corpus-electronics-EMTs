BTPC is a lossless or lossy image compression algorithm
based on multiresolution (Robinson, 1997). The image is
successively split into a high-resolution image and a low-
resolution quarter image, where the low-resolution image is
split up further. The pixels in the high-resolution image are
predicted based on patterns in the neighboring pixels. The
remaining error is then expected to achieve high compression
ratios with an adaptive Huffman coder.
