Consider the following signals, sketch each one of them and comment on the periodic nature:
(a) x(t ) = A cos(2πf0t + θ ), where A, f 0, and θ are the amplitude, frequency, and phase of
(b) x(t ) = ej (2πf0t+θ ), A > 0.
(c) Unit step signal u−1(t) deﬁned by u−1(t ) =
(d) Discrete-time signal x[n] = A cos(2πf0n + θ ), where n is an integer.
