Unfortunately, dc bias had its problems. Since only a small portion of the magnetism curve was
straight enough to use, the output signal was weak compared with the natural hiss of the unmagnetized
tape passing the playback head. This is commonly called poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Weâ€™ll explain
SNR in more detail later.
