Constant Expression Removal. The task of allocating program variables to physical locations is accomplished
by all compilers; we have shown that there are many ways to achieve this goal with varying ease or run-time
performance.  This  section  explores  a  compiler  task  which  is  done  strictly  for  optimizationâ€”the  removal  of
constant  expressions.  In  exploring  this  task,  we  show  strategies  for  the  recognition  of  this  optimization  and
also some caveats in their application.
