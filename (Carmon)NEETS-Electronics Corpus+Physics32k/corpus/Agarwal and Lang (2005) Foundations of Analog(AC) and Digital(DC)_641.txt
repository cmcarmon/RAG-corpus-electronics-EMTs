For a diode, because VTH is about 25 mV at room temperature, for ID =
1 mA, the incremental resistance rd = 25 . Similarly, for ID = 1.45 A, rd =
0.017 . Note: The incremental resistance in general is not the same as the resis-
tor Rd used in the piecewise linear model of W W W Figure 4.33c. There we were
trying for a fit over a large range of current, and hence would compromise on a
different resistance value. The difference between Rd and rd can be clearly under-
stood by comparing the two graphical interpretations, W W W Figures 4.33d
and 4.37.
