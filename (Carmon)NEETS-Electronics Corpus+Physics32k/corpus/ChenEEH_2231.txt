Because of these properties, a conductor can be slipped into
an existing electrostatic ﬁeld and be left unchanged as long as
its surface conforms to an equipotential and it is raised to the
same potential level (voltage) as that equipotential relative to
inﬁnity (ground). Of course, an arbitrary constant potential
can always be added to the entire system without changing
the ﬁelds. Thus, a system of two line charges, such as the system
in Figure 2.6, can also describe a system of one line charge
(the black one) in the presence of a grounded PEC cylinder (the
circle A in Figure 2.7), of a grounded plane (the symmetry line
B in Figure 2.6), inside a grounded cylinder (the circle C in
Figure 2.6), or even of the ﬁeld of two cylindrical conductors
