It is theoretically possible for minor planets on an Earth-crossing orbit could transit the Moon. However, such events would be extremely rare since only a few catalogued minor planets, such as 2004 FH, have come closer to Earth than the distance of the Moon. Such an event might be observable (an asteroid with 25 metres diameter at a distance of 380,000 km has an angular diameter of 0.01"), but none has been observed as yet, although there have been some reports of such events, sometimes classified as UFO-sightings.
