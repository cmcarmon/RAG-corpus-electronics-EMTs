Electronic test equipment, shown in Figure 8-8, is 
used to generate signals and capture responses from 
electronic circuits. Using the test equipment can 
prove that an electronic circuit is operating properly 
or show that there are faults in the circuit that can be 
traced and repaired. Use of electronic test equipment 
is essential to any serious work on electronics circuits,
