One type of noise that often arises is noise that is Gaussian but not white. In this case, the detection problem
(73.1)–(73.2) can be converted to an equivalent problem with white noise by applying a linear ﬁltering process
known as prewhitening to the measurements. In particular, on denoting the noise covariance matrix by (, we
can write
