The RC filter has some disadvantages. First, the voltage drop across R1 takes voltage away from the 
load. Second, power is wasted in R1 and is dissipated in the form of unwanted heat. Finally, if the load 
resistance changes, the voltage across the load will change. Even so, the advantages of the RC filter 
overshadow these disadvantages in many cases.
