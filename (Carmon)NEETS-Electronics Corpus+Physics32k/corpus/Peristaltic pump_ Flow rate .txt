Flow rate is an important parameter for a pump. The flow rate in a peristaltic pump is determined by many factors, such as:
Tube ID - higher flow rate with larger ID
Pump head OD - higher flow rate with larger OD
Pump head RPM - higher flow rate with higher RPM
Inlet Pulsation - the pulse reduces the filling volume of the hose
Increasing the number of rollers doesn't increase the flow rate, instead it will decrease the flow rate somewhat by reducing the effective (i.e. fluid-pumping) circumference of the head. Increasing rollers does tend to decrease the amplitude of the fluid pulsing at the outlet by increasing the frequency of the pulsed flow.
The length of tube (measured from initial pinch point near the inlet to the final release point near the outlet) does not affect the flow rate. However, a longer tube implies more pinch points between inlet and outlet, increasing the pressure that the pump can generate.
The flow rate of a peristaltic pump is in most cases not linear. The effect of pulsation at the inlet of the pump changes the filling degree of the peristaltic hose. With high inlet pulsation the peristaltic hose with become oval and this is resulting in less flow. Accurate metering with a peristaltic pump is therefore only possible when the pump has a constant flow rate, or when inlet pulsation is complete eliminated with the use of correct designed pulsation dampeners.
