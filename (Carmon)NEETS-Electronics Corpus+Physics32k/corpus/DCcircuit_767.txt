Meggers are ﬁeld instruments: that is, they are designed to be portable and operated by a
technician on the job site with as much ease as a regular ohmmeter. They are very useful for
checking high-resistance ”short” failures between wires caused by wet or degraded insulation.
Because they utilize such high voltages, they are not as affected by stray voltages (voltages
less than 1 volt produced by electrochemical reactions between conductors, or ”induced” by
neighboring magnetic ﬁelds) as ordinary ohmmeters.
