▶✓ Creating timers: Because it takes time to charge and discharge a capaci-
tor, capacitors are often used in timing circuits to create ticks and tocks 
when the voltage rises above or falls below a certain level. The timing 
of the ticking and tocking can be controlled through the selection of the 
capacitor and other circuit components. (For details, see the section 
“Teaming Up with Resistors,” later in the chapter.)
