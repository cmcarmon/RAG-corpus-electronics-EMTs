will trigger the failure diagnosis mechanism to analyze the
situation and further decide which control actions should be
taken. If the failure is recognized as an expected fault by
comparing the failure signatures with those of the existing
post failures, the corresponding postfailure control actions
will be selected as the current effective control commands.
Otherwise, the developed intelligent FTC technique is initial-
ized. Notice that the dashed line shown in Figure 8.5 indicates
that only one action will be taken at every time instant.
