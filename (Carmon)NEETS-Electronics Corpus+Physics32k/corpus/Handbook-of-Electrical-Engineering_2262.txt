Amorphous  semiconductors  do  not  have  a  crystalline  lattice,  and  their  properties  are  determined  by  the
arrangement  of  the  nearest  neighboring  atoms.  Even  so,  experimental  data  show  that  the  forbidden  energy
band concept can be applied to characterize their electrical properties. However, the disordered nature of these
materials results in a large number of localized quantum states with energies within the energy gap. The localized
states  in  the  upper  and  lower  half  of  the  gap  behave  like  acceptors  and  donors,  respectively. As  an  example,
consider the density of states in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) shown in Fig. 22.8. The distribution
of the localized states is not symmetrical with respect to the middle of the energy gap. In particular, the undoped
hydrogenated amorphous silicon is an n-type semiconductor.
