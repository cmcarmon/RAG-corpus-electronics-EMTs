Nowadays, the crosscoupling capacitance between parallel
neighboring wires, which can get routed together for long
distances, is gaining great importance compared to the self-
capacitance wires. The crosscoupling can either lead to a large
increase in delay, coupling noise, min delay, or power con-
sumption problems, depending on the switching direction of
neighboring wires. Avoiding these delay and noise problems
would involve drastically increased wire spacing or extensive
shielding. Further, studies on both the Pentium III and Pen-
tium IV processor ï¬‚oor plans have clearly shown that they
tend to be interconnect-limited for die area, which increases
the penalty for spacing and shielding. Thus, there is a funda-
mental design trade-off between a simple, robust wiring solu-
tion employing extensive spacing and shielding versus an
aggressive solution employing short wiring with only judicious
shielding leading to high density. The latter requires sophisti-
cated CAD tools, has more risks, but ultimately is much more
optimal for a high-volume product. It was therefore the choice
for the Intel Pentium IV processor (Intel, 2001).
