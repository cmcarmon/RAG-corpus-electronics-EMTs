in Fig. 6.37. Determine the voltages that will 
 
appear at test points A, B and C.  
 
6.5  
In  Fig.  6.37,  determine  the  current  flowing 
in R1 and the power dissipated in D5 when 
 
the  circuit  is  operated  without  any  load 
 
connected. 
 
6.6  
In Fig. 6.37, determine the effect of each of 
the following fault conditions: 
 
(a) R1 open-circuit; 
 
(b) D5 open-circuit; 
 
 
(c) D5 short-circuit. 
6.7  A 220 V AC supply feeds a 20:1 step-down 
transformer,  the  secondary  of  which  is 
 
connected to a bridge rectifier and reservoir 
 
capacitor.  Determine  the  approximate  d.c. 
 
 
voltage that will appear across the reservoir 
capacitor under ‘no-load’ conditions.
