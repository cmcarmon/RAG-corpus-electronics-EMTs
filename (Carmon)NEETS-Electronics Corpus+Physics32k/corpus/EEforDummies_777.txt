Sizing up your wire gauge
You refer to the diameter of wire as the wire gauge. As luck would have it, the 
relationship between wire gauge and wire diameter in electronics is essen-
tially backward: The smaller the wire gauge, the larger the wire diameter. You 
can see common wire gauges in Table 12-1.
