But if the actual system does not have elements with equations that can be written to accept current as input
and voltage as output, shunt R and C of ﬁctitious origin can be inserted at the cost of some loss in accuracy
to fulﬁll the necessary interface requirement. For good accuracy, the current in the introduced ﬁctitious branch
element should be kept very small relative to the currents of the actual branches by using very large R or very
small C. In practice, loop instability in analog computation and numerical stiffness in digital computation will
determine the lower bound on how small an error can be attained. In spite of the small error introduced, this
technique can be very useful, as evident from trying to use the above dc motor simulation to simulate an open-
circuit  operation  of  the  motor.  While  it  is  possible  to  reformulate  the  equations  to  handle  the  open-circuit
condition,  the  equations  as  given  with  voltage  input  and  current  output  can  be  used  for  the  open-circuit
condition if one is willing to accept a small inaccuracy of introducing a very large resistor to approximate the
open-circuit. On the other hand, the simulation of short-circuit operation with the above model can be easily
implemented using a Va of zero.
