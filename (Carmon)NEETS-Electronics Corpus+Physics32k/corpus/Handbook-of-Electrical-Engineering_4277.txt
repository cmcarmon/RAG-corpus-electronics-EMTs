Using Eq. (41.10) the Doppler frequencies have been calculated for several speeds and are given in Table 41.8.
As may be seen, the Doppler frequencies at 10 GHz (X-band) range from 30 Hz to about 18 kHz for a speed
range between 1 and 600 mph. The spectral width of these Doppler frequencies will depend on target ï¬‚uctuation
and acceleration, antenna scanning effects, frequency variation in oscillators or components (for example, due
