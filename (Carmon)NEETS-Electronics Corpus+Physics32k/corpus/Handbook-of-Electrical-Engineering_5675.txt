Stability Criteria
System stability is the ability of all synchronous generators in operation to stay in synchronism with each other
while moving from one operating condition to another. Steady-state stability refers to small changes in operating
conditions, such as normal load changes. Transient stability refers to larger, abrupt changes, such as the loss of
the  largest  generator  or  a  short  circuit  followed  by  circuit  breakers  opening,  where  synchronism  or  loss  of
synchronism occurs within a few seconds. Dynamic stability refers to longer time periods, from minutes up to
a half hour following a large, abrupt change, where steam generators (boilers), automatic generation control,
and system operator actions affect stability.
