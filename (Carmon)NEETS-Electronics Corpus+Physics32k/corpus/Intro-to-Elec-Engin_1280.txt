A transducer is usually required to convert the output of a source into an electrical signal
that is suitable for transmission. Typical examples include a microphone converting an acoustic
speech or a video camera converting an image into electric signals. A similar transducer is needed
at the destination to convert the received electric signals into a form (such as voice, image, etc.)
that is suitable for the user.
