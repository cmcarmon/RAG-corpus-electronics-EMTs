Changes in the urine flow rate can be indicative of kidney, prostate or other renal disorders. Similarly, by measuring urine flow rate, it is possible to calculate the clearance of metabolites that are used as clinical markers for disease.
The urinary flow rate in males with benign prostate hyperplasia is influenced, although not statistically by voiding position. In a meta-analysis on the influence of voiding position in males on urodynamics, males with this condition showed an improvement of 1.23 ml/s in the sitting position. Healthy, young males were not influenced by changing voiding position.
