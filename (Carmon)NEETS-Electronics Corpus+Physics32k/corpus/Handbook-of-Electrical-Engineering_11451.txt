Silicon Detectors
In  contrast  to  germanium  detectors,  silicon  detectors  can  be  operated  at  room  temperature  in  applications
where some current noise can be tolerated. Compared to gas and scintillation detectors, silicon detectors have
good energy resolution and are reasonably compact. They are fabricated from slices of a silicon single crystal
and are available in a variety of areas (25 mm2 to 3000 mm2), and the active thickness is usually a few hundred
microns. Specialized detectors have been developed for a wide variety of applications.
