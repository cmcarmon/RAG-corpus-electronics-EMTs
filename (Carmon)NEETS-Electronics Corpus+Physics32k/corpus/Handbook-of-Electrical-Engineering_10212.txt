Emerging Issues
Robotics, by deﬁnition, is a highly multidisciplinary ﬁeld. Applications are broad, and even those applications
focused on the manufacturing shop ﬂoor are too numerous to cover in full here. The reader is referred to the
various journals published by the IEEE and other societies and publishers, a few of which have been listed in
the references. Still, it is worthwhile to note a few issues relevant to manufacturing shop-ﬂoor applications that
could have an impact over the next decade. These issues include gripper development, mobility, and intelligent
robots. The objective of this work is the overall integration of a ﬂexible manufacturing system.
