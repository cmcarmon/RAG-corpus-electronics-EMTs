Two basic assumptions are used to arrive at Eqs. (40.17) through (40.19): (1) The response of the power line
(scattered voltages and currents) to the impinging EM wave (incident ﬁeld) is quasi-TEM (i.e., the scattered
ﬁelds can be approximated as transverse electromagnetic). This allows us to deﬁne a “static” voltage along the
line and to relate the line current and the scattered magnetic ﬂux by an inductance, as well as the line scattered
voltage and charge by a capacitance. (2) The transverse dimensions of the line system are small compared to
the  minimum  wavelength,  lmin,  of  the  excitation  wave,  and  the  height  of  the  line  is  much  larger  than  the
diameter of the wire.
