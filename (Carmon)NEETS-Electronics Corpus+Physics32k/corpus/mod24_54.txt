Developments in semiconductor technology, which provided the necessary light sources and
detectors, furthered the development of fiber optics. Conventional light sources, such as lamps or lasers,
were not easily used in fiber optic systems. These light sources tended to be too large and required lens
systems to launch light into the fiber. In 1971, Bell Laboratories developed a small area light-emitting
diode (LED). This light source was suitable for low-loss coupling to optical fibers. Researchers could
then perform source-to-fiber jointing easily and repeatedly. Early semiconductor sources had operating
lifetimes of only a few hours. However, by 1973, projected lifetimes of lasers advanced from a few hours
to greater than 1,000 hours. By 1977, projected lifetimes of lasers advanced to greater than 7,000 hours.
By 1979, these devices were available with projected lifetimes of more than 100,000 hours.
