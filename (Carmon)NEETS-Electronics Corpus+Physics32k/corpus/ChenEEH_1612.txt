Protocol analysis is another technique of data analysis ori-
ginated in clinical psychology. In this approach, an expert is
asked to talk about his or her thinking process while solving a
given problem. The difference from interviewing is that experts
ﬁnd it much easier to talk about speciﬁc problem instances
than to talk in abstract terms. The problem-solving process
being described is then analyzed to produce a structured model
of the expert’s knowledge, including objects of signiﬁcance,
important attributes of the objects, relationships among the
objects, and inferences drawn from the relationships. The
advantage of protocol analysis is the accurate description of
the speciﬁc actions and rationales as the expert solves the
problem.
