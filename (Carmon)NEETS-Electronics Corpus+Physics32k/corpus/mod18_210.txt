Any radar system has several major subsystems that perform standard functions. A typical radar
system consists of a SYNCHRONIZER (also called the TIMER or TRIGGER GENERATOR), a
TRANSMITTER, a DUPLEXER, a RECEIVER, and an INDICATOR. These major subsystems were
briefly described in chapter 1. This chapter will describe the operation of the synchronizer, transmitter,
duplexer, and receiver of a typical pulse radar system and briefly analyze the circuits used. Chapter 3 will
describe typical indicator and antenna subsystems. Because radar systems vary widely in specific design,
only a general description of representative circuits is presented in this chapter.
