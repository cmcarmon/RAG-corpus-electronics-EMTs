The total H at any point is the sum H ¼ H inc þ H secondary.
A plot of the H ﬁeld lines is shown in Figure 1.5. The magnetic
sphere causes H to be disturbed from its original uniform
nature. Inside the sphere, however, H is uniform and pointed
along the same axis as the incident ﬁeld, though its amplitude
is now less than H0 (and the amplitude of B is greater than B0)
when m > m0. This disturbance in H is due to the secondary H
produced by the induced magnetization M of the sphere. Using
equation 1.76:
