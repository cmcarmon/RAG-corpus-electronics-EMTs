From the convention of the Cauchy stress tensor (Figure 3 and Figure 4), the first subscript in the stress components denotes the face on which the stress component acts, and the second subscript indicates the direction of the stress component. Thus




τ

x
y




{\displaystyle \tau _{xy}}
is the shear stress acting on the face with normal vector in the positive direction of the



x


{\displaystyle x}
-axis, and in the positive direction of the



y


{\displaystyle y}
-axis.
In the physical-space sign convention, positive normal stresses are outward to the plane of action (tension), and negative normal stresses are inward to the plane of action (compression) (Figure 5).
In the physical-space sign convention, positive shear stresses act on positive faces of the material element in the positive direction of an axis. Also, positive shear stresses act on negative faces of the material element in the negative direction of an axis. A positive face has its normal vector in the positive direction of an axis, and a negative face has its normal vector in the negative direction of an axis. For example, the shear stresses




τ

x
y




{\displaystyle \tau _{xy}}
and




τ

y
x




{\displaystyle \tau _{yx}}
are positive because they act on positive faces, and they act as well in the positive direction of the



y


{\displaystyle y}
-axis and the



x


{\displaystyle x}
-axis, respectively (Figure 3). Similarly, the respective opposite shear stresses




τ

x
y




{\displaystyle \tau _{xy}}
and




τ

y
x




{\displaystyle \tau _{yx}}
acting in the negative faces have a positive sign because they act in the negative direction of the



x


{\displaystyle x}
-axis and



y


{\displaystyle y}
-axis, respectively.
