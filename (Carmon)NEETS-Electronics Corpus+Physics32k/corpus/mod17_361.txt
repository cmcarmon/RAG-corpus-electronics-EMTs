You will find in polar operation that the distortion of a signal is almost impossible through low line 
currents, high reactance, or random patching of signal circuits or equipment. In polar signaling when you 
experience a complete loss of current (a reading of zero on a milliammeter), you know you have line or 
equipment trouble; whereas the same condition with neutral signaling may indicate a steady space is 
being transmitted. This gives us a condition called RUNNING OPEN. Under this condition, the 
teletypewriter appears to be running because the machines is decoding the constant space as the Baudot 
character blank and the type hammer continually strikes the type box but there is no printing or type box 
movement across the page.
