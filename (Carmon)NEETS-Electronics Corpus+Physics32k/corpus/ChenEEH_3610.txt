where ^BBk(v) is the envelope function of Bk(v) formed by a set
of piecewise linear segments that start and end at consecutive
extremes of Bk(v). The band edges are considered extreme
frequencies, and the edges from different bands are not con-
nected. By denoting the extreme frequencies at a particular
iteration k as v0
the envelope function is
formed as:
