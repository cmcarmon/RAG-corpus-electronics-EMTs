You can make an analysis of the reverse voltage-current portion of the characteristic curve for a
diode with the method described above or with a diode test set. This test is very important for diodes used
in computer applications, where stability of operation is essential. Various diode conditions that may be
detected by this test are shown in figure 2-9, view A, view B, view C, and view D.
