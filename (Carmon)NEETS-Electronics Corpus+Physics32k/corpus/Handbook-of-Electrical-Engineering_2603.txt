Threshold Voltage
The threshold voltage is vaguely deﬁned as the gate voltage VTH at which the channel begins to form. At this
voltage devices begin to switch from “off ” to “on,” and circuits depend on a voltage swing that straddles this
value. Thus, threshold voltage helps in deciding the necessary supply voltage for circuit operation, and also it
helps in determining the leakage or “off ” current that ﬂows when the device is in the off state.
