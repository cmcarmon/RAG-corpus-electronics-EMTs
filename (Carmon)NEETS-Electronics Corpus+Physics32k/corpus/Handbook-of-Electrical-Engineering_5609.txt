Incentives for Computer Relaying
The  acceptance  of  computer  relays  has  been  due  to  economic  factors  which  have  made  microcomputers
relatively  inexpensive  and  computationally  powerful.  In  addition  to  this  economic  advantage,  the  computer
relays are also far more versatile. Through their self-diagnostic capability, they provide an assurance of avail-
ability. Thus, even if they should suffer the same (or even greater) number of failures in the ﬁeld as traditional
relays,  their  failures  could  be  communicated  to  control  centers  and  a  maintenance  crew  called  to  repair  the
failures immediately. This type of diagnostic capability was lacking in traditional protection systems and often
led to failures of relays, which went undetected for extended periods. Such hidden failures have been identiﬁed
as one of the main sources of power system blackouts.
