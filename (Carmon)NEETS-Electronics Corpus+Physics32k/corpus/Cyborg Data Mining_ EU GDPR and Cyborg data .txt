In April 2016, the European Union tabled legislation for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC of 1995, and comes into force on May 25, 2018. Internet-enabled wearable and future implantable technologies will fall under the purview of this legislation. The directive will implement tougher fines for non-compliance and breaches, and gives consumers more control over how their personal data is used. Some of these consumer rights are, but are not limited to, having the right:
To request data in monthly intervals;
To access any information a company holds on them;
To know why that data is being processed;
To know how long it is stored for;
To know who gets to see their data;
To demand that their data be deleted if it is no longer necessary to the purpose for which it was collected; and so forth
