Many electronic circuits are not in an "on" condition all of the time. In computers, for example, 
waveforms must be turned on and off for specific lengths of time. The time intervals vary from tenths of 
microseconds to several thousand microseconds. Square and rectangular waveforms are normally used to 
turn such circuits on and off because the sharp leading and trailing edges make them ideal for timing 
purposes.
