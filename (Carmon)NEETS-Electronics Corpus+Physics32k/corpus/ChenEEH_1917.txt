Array of Independent Cells
In Figure 8.2, each cell i is covered by cell i þ 1. Suppose that
all inputs are available to the circuit at time t and that the
maximum propagation delay of a cell is d. Then all original
outputs are available from the primary cells at time t þ d. At
time t þ d, the outputs are latched, and the inputs are for-
warded to the cover cells for the checking computation. At
time t þ 2d, the checking outputs are available from the cover
cells. These are compared with the latched original outputs,
which have also been forwarded to the cover cells, and any
error signals are latched.
