Time-stepping is continued until the desired late-time pulse
response is observed at the ﬁeld points of interest. For linear
wave interaction problems, the sinusoidal response at these
ﬁeld points can be obtained over a wide band of frequencies
by discrete Fourier transformation of the computed ﬁeld
versus time waveforms at these points. Prolonged ‘‘ringing’’
of the computed ﬁeld waveforms due to a high Q-factor or
large electrical size of the structure being modeled requires a
combination of extending the computational window in time
and extrapolating the windowed data before Fourier trans-
formation.
