Electromagnetism	is	a	branch	of	science	that	involves	the	study	of	electricity	and
magnetism.	It	follows	that	wherever	there	is	an	electric	field,	there	is	also	a
magnetic	field.	It	was	initially	introduced	and	developed	by	Hans	Christian
Orsted.	In	1802,	an	Italian	scholar	by	the	name	of	Gian	Domenico	Romagnosi	also
examined	the	field
In	circuitry,	understanding	the	concept	behind	electromagnetism	is	important	due
the	possibly	strong	electromagnetic	reaction	of	circuit	components.	It	follows	that
the	EMF	(or	electromagnetic	force)	of	any	circuit	serves	a	major	role	in	the
determination	of	internal	properties.
Chapter	V,	Power	Transfer	at	Max,	and	Chapter	VI,	Laws,	Laws	&	More	Laws,
contain	different	discussions	about	transferring	electric	current	and	voltage.	In
electromagnetism,	more	discussions	about	transfer	will	be	tackled.	This	time,
however,	the	focus	is	on	the	charged	elements	in	a	circuit	(whether	negatively	or
positively	charged),	as	well	as	their	responses	when	exposed	to	movement.
The	primary	principles	of	electromagnetism:
