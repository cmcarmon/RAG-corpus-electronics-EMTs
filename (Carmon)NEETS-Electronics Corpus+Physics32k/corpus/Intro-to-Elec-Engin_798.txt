For the NOR gate of Figure 9.3.5(b), when both inputs VA and VB are low, both NMOS
devices will be off with both PMOS devices on, and the output Vout is high around VSS. If, on
the other hand, one of the inputs goes to be high, the associated PMOS device turns off and the
corresponding NMOS device turns on, thereby yielding an output Vout to be low. Thus, the CMOS
device of Figure 9.3.5(b) functions as a NOR gate. Note that neither gate in Figure 9.3.5 draws
virtually any power-supply current, so that there is virtually no power consumption.
