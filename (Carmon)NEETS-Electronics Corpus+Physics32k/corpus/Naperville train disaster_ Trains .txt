The Advance Flyer and Exposition Flyer were diesel-powered high-speed inter-city passenger trains; the Exposition Flyer would soon be replaced by the California Zephyr. Both were scheduled to leave Chicago's Union Station at 12:35 PM, the Advance Flyer took a two-minute lead as they both sped west in two sections. The day of the wreck the Advance Flyer had 2 EMD E7 locomotives with 8 head-end and 5 passenger cars. The Exposition Flyer had EMD E5A&B locomotives with 9 passenger cars, four of which were sleepers. This was a short train for the run; normally 12 to 16 cars were needed.
