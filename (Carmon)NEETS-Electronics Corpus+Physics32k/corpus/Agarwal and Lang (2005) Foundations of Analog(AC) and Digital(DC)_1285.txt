The conductor in the figure has a width W, and it is located the distance
G above the ground plane. Such conductors are typically surrounded by an
insulating dielectric having a permittivity of  > ◦ and a permeability of µ◦.
Under the assumption that W (cid:5) G, we can ignore the fringing electric and
magnetic fields at the edges of the conductor. In this case, the capacitance ˜C and
inductance ˜L of the conductor per unit length along its length is approximately
