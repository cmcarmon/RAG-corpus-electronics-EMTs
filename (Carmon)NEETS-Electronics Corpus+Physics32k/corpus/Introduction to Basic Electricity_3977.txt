Figure 38-27 shows an op-amp used as a high-pass 
filter. A high-pass filter rejects low frequencies while 
passing frequencies above a certain cut-off frequency.  
Figure 38-28 shows an op-amp used as a low-pass 
 filter. A low-pass filter passes low frequencies while 
blocking frequencies above the cut-off frequency. 
 Figure 38-29 shows an op-amp used as a band-pass 
filter. A band-pass filter passes frequencies around 
some central frequency while attenuating both higher 
and lower frequencies.
