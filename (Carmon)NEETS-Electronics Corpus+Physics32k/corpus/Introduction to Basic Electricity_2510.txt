The sweep generator provides a sawtooth waveform 
as input to the horizontal deflection amplifier. The 
horizontal and vertical deflection amplifiers increase 
the amplitude of the input voltage to the proper level 
for deflection of the electron beam in the cathode-ray 
tube. The power supply provides DC voltages to oper-
ate the amplifiers and cathode-ray tube.
