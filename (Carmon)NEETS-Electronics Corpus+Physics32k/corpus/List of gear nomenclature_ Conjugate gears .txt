Conjugate gears transmit uniform rotary motion from one shaft to another by means of gear teeth. The normals to the profiles of these teeth, at all points of contact, must pass through a fixed point in the common centerline of the two shafts. Usually conjugate gear tooth is made to suit the profile of other gear which is not made based on standard practice.
