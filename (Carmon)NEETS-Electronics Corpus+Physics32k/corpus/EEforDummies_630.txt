Biasing the transistor so it acts like an amplifier
A transistor must be partially on to work as an amplifier. To put a transis-
tor in this state, you bias it by applying a small voltage to the base. In the 
example that was shown in Figure 10-7, resistors R1 and R2 are connected to 
the base of the transistor and configured as a voltage divider (for more about 
how a voltage divider works, see Chapter 6), dividing the supply voltage, 
Vsupply. The output of this voltage divider,  R1
Vsupply, supplies enough volt-
age to the base to turn the transistor on and allow current to flow through it, 
biasing the transistor so it’s in the active mode (that is, partially on).
