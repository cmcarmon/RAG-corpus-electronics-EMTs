Intrinsic Magnetic Properties
Intrinsic magnetic properties are those properties that depend on the type of atoms and their composition and
crystal  structure,  but  not  on  the  previous  history  of  a  particular  sample.  Examples  of  intrinsic  magnetic
properties  are  the  saturation  magnetization,  Curie  temperature,  magnetocrystallic  anisotropy,  and  magneto-
striction.
