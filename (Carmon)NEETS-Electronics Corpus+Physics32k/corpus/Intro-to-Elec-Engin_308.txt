(b) Consider the analogy between electrical and
hydraulic systems given in Table 1.5.2. Obtain
the mass balance equation by equating the rate
of change of ﬂuid volume to the net difference
between input and output ﬂow. Identify this
equation with that of an RC circuit excited by
a current source i(t ) = I .
3.1.2 Consider an RL series circuit excited by (a) v(t ) =
−2t V, and (b) v(t ) = 20 V. Determine the
20e
forced component of the voltage across the induc-
tor for R = 2  and L = 2 H.
*3.1.3 Consider an RC parallel circuit excited by (a)
i(t ) = 20e
−2t A, and (b) i(t ) = 20 A. Find
the forced component of the current through the
capacitor for R = 2  and C = 2 F.
