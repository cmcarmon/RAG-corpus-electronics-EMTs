The energy required to produce an electron-hole pair (ε) is typically a few times the energy bandgap of the
material. In silicon where the bandgap is 1.14 eV, the energy to produce an electron-hole pair (ε) is 3.62 eV. In
HgI2, where the bandgap is 2.13 eV, about 4.2 eV is required to create an electron-hole pair. The absorption of
a 1 MeV photon thus produces about 276,000 e-h pairs in silicon and 240,000 e-h pairs in HgI2. Values of ε
for room-temperature materials are in the region of 4.2 to 5.0 eV/e-h pair (see Table 116.2) and consequently
fewer electron-hole pairs are generated per unit of absorbed energy. Complete collection of the charge is desired
although charge trapping, which may not affect the two carrier types equally, prevents this in most cases. The
drift  length  for  holes  (λ
h)  in  these  materials  is  often  less  than  the  inter-contact  dimensions  and  creates  a
condition  where  the  collection  efﬁciency  depends  on  the  photon  interaction  depth.  This  phenomenon  is
illustrated  in  Fig. 116.15  where  induced  charge  from  single  gamma  absorption  events  originating  at  various
