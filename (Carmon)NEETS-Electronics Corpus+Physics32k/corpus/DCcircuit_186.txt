Other electrical components exhibit even stranger current/voltage curves than this. Some
devices actually experience a decrease in current as the applied voltage increases. Because the
slope of the current/voltage for this phenomenon is negative (angling down instead of up as it
progresses from left to right), it is known as negative resistance.
