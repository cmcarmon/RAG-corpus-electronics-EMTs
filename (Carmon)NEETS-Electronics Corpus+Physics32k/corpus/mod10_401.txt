A TRANSMISSION LINE is a device designed to guide electrical energy from one point to another.
It is used, for example, to transfer the output rf energy of a transmitter to an antenna. This energy will not
travel through normal electrical wire without great losses. Although the antenna can be connected directly
to the transmitter, the antenna is usually located some distance away from the transmitter. On board ship,
