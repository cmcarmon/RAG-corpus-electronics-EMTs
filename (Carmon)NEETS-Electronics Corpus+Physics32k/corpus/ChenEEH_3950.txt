There is a rich body of literature on the subjects of statistical
signal processing and mathematical statistics. A classic textbook
on detection and estimation is by van Trees (1968). This book
provides a good basic treatment of the subject, and it is easy to
read. Since then, many books have been written. Textbooks
written by Poor (1988) and Kay (1993, 1998) are the more
popular ones. Poor’s book provides a fairly complete coverage
of the subject of signal detection and estimation. Its presenta-
tion is built on the principles of mathematical statistics and
includes some brief discussions of nonparametric and robust
detection theory. Kay’s books are more relevant to signal pro-
cessing applications though they also include a good deal of
theoretical treatment in statistics. In addition, Kassam (1988)
