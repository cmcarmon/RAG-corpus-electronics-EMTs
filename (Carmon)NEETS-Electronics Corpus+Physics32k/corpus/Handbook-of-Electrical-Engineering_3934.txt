which  is  preferred  to  minimize  spurious  radiation  and  coupling.  Fabrication  is  a  bit  more  difÔ¨Åcult  than  the
single-layer coax or line feed, because of the requirement of bonding and aligning two substrates. The equivalent
circuit of the proximity-coupled element is shown in Fig. 38.19b, where the series capacitor is indicative of the
capacitive nature of the coupling between the open-ended microstrip line and the patch element.
