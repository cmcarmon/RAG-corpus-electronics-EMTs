Assuming the tungsten ﬁlament is approximately 30008C when
lit and using a ¼ 0:0045=8 C from Table 1.1, then using this
last equation gives R0  13 V for the resistance of a room-
temperature 75-W light bulb. This agrees closely with a meas-
ured value of 13.1 V even though using a at such a large
temperature was not justiﬁed.
