Because of the nature of two-body motion in a conservative gravitational field, two aspects of the motion do not change: the angular momentum and the mechanical energy.
The first constant, called specific angular momentum, can be defined as




h
=
2



d
A


d
t



,


{\displaystyle h=2{\frac {dA}{dt}},}

and substituting in the above equation, mean motion is also




n
=


h

.


{\displaystyle n={\frac {h}{ab}}.}

The second constant, called specific mechanical energy, can be defined,




ξ
=
−


μ

a



.


{\displaystyle \xi =-{\frac {\mu }{2a}}.}

Rearranging and multiplying by 1/a2,

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {-2\xi }{a^{2}}}={\frac {\mu }{a^{3}}}.}

From above, the square of mean motion n2 = μ/a3. Substituting and rearranging, mean motion can also be expressed,




n
=


1
a




−
2
ξ


,


{\displaystyle n={\frac {1}{a}}{\sqrt {-2\xi }},}

where the −2 shows that ξ must be defined as a negative number, as is customary in celestial mechanics and astrodynamics.
