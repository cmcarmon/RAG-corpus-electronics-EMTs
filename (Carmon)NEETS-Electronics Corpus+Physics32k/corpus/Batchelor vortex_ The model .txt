The Batchelor vortex is an approximate solution to the Navier-Stokes equations obtained using a boundary layer approximation. The physical reasoning behind this approximation is the assumption that the axial gradient of the flow field of interest is of much smaller magnitude than the radial gradient.
The axial, radial and azimuthal velocity components of the vortex are denoted



U


{\displaystyle U}
,



V


{\displaystyle V}
and



W


{\displaystyle W}
respectively and can be represented in cylindrical coordinates



(
x

{\displaystyle (x,r,\theta )}
as follows:

{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{cl}U(r)&=U_{\infty }+{\frac {W_{0}}{(R/R_{0})^{2}}}e^{-(r/R)^{2}},\\V(r)&=0,\\W(r)&=qW_{0}{\frac {1-e^{-(r/R)^{2}}}{(r/R_{0})}}.\end{array}}}

The parameters in the above equations are

{\displaystyle U_{\infty }}

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

and

q

, the swirl strength, given as a ratio between the maximum tangential velocity and the core velocity.

Note that the radial component of the velocity is zero and that the axial and azimuthal components depend only on

We now write the system above in dimensionless form by scaling time by a factor
