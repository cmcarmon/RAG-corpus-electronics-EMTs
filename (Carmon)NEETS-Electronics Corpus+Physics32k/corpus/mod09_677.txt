INTEGRATION takes place in an RC circuit with the output taken across the capacitor. The 
amount of integration is dependent upon the time constant of the circuit. Full integration takes place when 
the time constant of the RC circuit is at least 10 times greater than the duration of the input pulse. An RL 
circuit is also used as an integration circuit. The output is taken across the resistor and the time constant of 
the circuit is 10 times greater than the input pulse.
