A fourth important class of pattern-matching problems
occurring in speech processing is that of assessing similarity
between two sequences. The line between this class and the
one immediately preceeding is not distinct because one may
consider a particular sequence as a ‘‘model’’ for a given class or
entity (e.g., a word), or several sequences may be combined in
some manner to produce a ‘‘model sequence’’ for a particular
entity. Older techniques in speech recognition and related
problems in particular, ‘‘dynamic time warping’’ (discussed
later) rely on such direct measures of intersequence distance.
Coding and decoding problems in speech processing routinely
deploy such techniques as well. The upcoming discussions will
provide ample illustration.
Finally, we return to the clustering problem. Clustering
refers to the act of categorizing J objects into K  J classes
or categories according to strategies that maximize intra-
class similarity and minimize interclass similarity. Clustering
methods are numerous and varied depending on the applica-
tion, types of measurements available, similarity measures
used, as well as other factors (Devijver and Kittler, 1982).
Although cluster formation often employs feature-to-feature
matching (i.e.,
‘‘objects’’ represented by features or feature
vectors), the ‘‘objects’’ can be sequences or models as well.
Thus, any of the pattern-matching problems already discussed
may ﬁgure into the clustering procedure.
