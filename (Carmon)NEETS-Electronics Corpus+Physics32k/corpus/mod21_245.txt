Use extreme caution whenever testing or working around lead-acid storage batteries. OPNAVINST
5100.23B emphatically states that you must wear eye protection devices at all times and that emergency
eyewash facilities must be immediately adjacent to, or within 10 feet of, any eye-hazard area. Smoking
and spark-producing tools or devices are also prohibited in enclosed spaces that contain lead-acid storage
batteries. When charging, these batteries produce sufficient quantities of hydrogen to produce large
explosions. Lead-acid storage batteries should only be charged in well-ventilated spaces.
