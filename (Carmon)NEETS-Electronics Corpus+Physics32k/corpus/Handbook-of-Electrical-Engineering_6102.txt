The  analysis  techniques  can  be  either  linear  or  nonlinear.  If  successful,  the  nonlinear  algorithm  is  more
accurate  but  these  techniques  suffer  from  larger  data  storage  requirements,  greater  computational  time,  and
possible divergence. There are various possible optimization techniques that can and have been applied to this
problem. There is no deÔ¨Ånitive answer and each type of problem may require a different choice.
