The HYBRID RING is used as a duplexer in high-power radar systems. It is very effective in
isolating the receiver during transmission. A simplified version of the hybrid-ring duplexer is shown in
views A and B of figure 2-22. The operation of the duplexer, in terms of the E field distribution during
transmission and reception, is illustrated in views C and D. The H lines, though present, have been
omitted to simplify the explanation.
