The mass of Jupiter is derived from the measured value called the Jovian mass parameter, which is denoted with GMJ. The mass of Jupiter is calculated by dividing GMJ by the constant G. For celestial bodies such as Jupiter, Earth and the Sun, the value of the GM product is known to many orders of magnitude more precisely than either factor independently. The limited precision available for G limits the uncertainty of the derived mass. For this reason, astronomers often prefer to refer to the gravitational parameter, rather than the explicit mass. The GM products are used when computing the ratio of Jupiter mass relative to other objects.
In 2015, the International Astronomical Union defined the nominal Jovian mass parameter to remain constant regardless of subsequent improvements in measurement precision of MJ. This constant is defined as exactly:

{\displaystyle ({\mathcal {GM}})_{\mathrm {J} }^{\mathrm {N} }}
= 1.2668653Ã—1017 m3/s2
If the explicit mass of Jupiter is needed in SI units, it can be calculated in terms of the Gravitational constant, G by dividing GM by G.
