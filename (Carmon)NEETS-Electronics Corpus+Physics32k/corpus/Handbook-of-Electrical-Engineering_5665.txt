Equipment Loading Criteria
Typical equipment loading criteria are given in Table 61.6. With no equipment outages, transmission equipment
loadings should not exceed normal ratings for all realistic combinations of generation and interchange. Oper-
ation  of  all  generating  units  including  base-loaded  and  peaking  units  during  peak  load  periods  as  well  as
operation of various combinations of generation and interchange during off-peak periods should be considered.
Also, normal ratings should not be exceeded with all transmission lines and transformers in service and with
any generating unit out of service.
