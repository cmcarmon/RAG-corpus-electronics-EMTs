Mouse
The mouse has gone a long way from its original invention by Engelbart in 1965, through its redesign at Xerox
and introduction by Apple as a main input device, and its general acceptance by computer users as an important
addition to the group of input devices. It should be noted, in passing, that the mouse is essentially an upside-
down trackball, although the latter is now being referred to as an upside-down mouse. However, the trackball
came Ô¨Årst and is described further in the next section.
