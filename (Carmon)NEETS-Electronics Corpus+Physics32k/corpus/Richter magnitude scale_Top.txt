The Richter magnitude scale (ML, also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the size of an earthquake. The Richter scale, developed in the 1930s by Charles Francis Richter, is a base-10 logarithmic scale in order to cover the huge range of earthquakes. It defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude, as recorded on a standardized seismograph at a standard distance.
As measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times greater than an earthquake that registered 4.0 at the same distance. As energy release is generally proportional to the shaking amplitude raised to the ​3⁄2 power, an increase of 1 magnitude corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake. This means that, for instance, an earthquake of magnitude 5 releases 31.6 times as much energy as an earthquake of magnitude 4.
The Richter scale built on the previous, more subjective Mercalli intensity scale by offering a quantifiable measure of an earthquake's size.
In the United States, the Richter scale was succeeded in the 1970s by the moment magnitude scale. The moment magnitude is used by the US Geological Survey to describe magnitudes for all earthquakes.
