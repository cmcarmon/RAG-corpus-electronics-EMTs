F. Placement and Routing: When an acceptable ﬂoorplan has been established, the next step is to complete
the routing of interconnections among the various blocks of the design. As interconnections are routed,
the  overall  IC  area  expands  to  provide  the  area  for  the  wiring,  with  the  possibility  that  the  original
ﬂoorplan (which ignored interconnections) is not optimal. Placement [Shahookar and Mazumder, 1991]
considers  various  rearrangements  of  the  circuit  blocks,  without  changing  their  internal  design  but
allowing rotations, etc. For example, the arrangement of some of the blocks in Fig. 25.25(c) have been
changed in the arrangement in Fig. 25.25(d).
