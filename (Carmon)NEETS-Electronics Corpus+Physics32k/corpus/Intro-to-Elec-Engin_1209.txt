overall efÔ¨Åciency. The speed of the machine is governed by the value of the voltage drop in the
series resistor and is therefore a function of the load on the machine. The application of this method
of control is thus limited. Because of its low initial cost, however, the series-resistance method,
or a variation of it, is often attractive economically for short-time or intermittent slowdowns.
