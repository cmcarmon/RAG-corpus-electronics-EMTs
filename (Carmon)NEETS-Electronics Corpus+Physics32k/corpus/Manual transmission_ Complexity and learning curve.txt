For most people, there is a slight learning curve with a manual transmission, which may be intimidating and unappealing for an inexperienced driver. Because the driver must develop a feel for properly engaging the clutch, an inexperienced driver will often stall the engine. Most drivers can learn how to drive a vehicle with a manual transmission in as little as an hour, although it may take weeks before it becomes "second nature". Additionally, if an inexperienced driver selects an inappropriate gear by mistake, damage to mechanical components and even loss of control can occur if not rectified quickly. Learning clutch/throttle pedal coordination can be made easier by using the clutch pedal only, on a level surface. This will allow the operator to gauge where the "sweet spot" of clutch engagement is. Correct "release speed" of the clutch pedal (slow for smooth, fast for abrupt) will indicate when and where throttle pedal use should occur.
In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, a driving licence issued for only vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a licence for manual transmissions covers both. This is also the case for P1 (provisional-1) car licence holders in New South Wales, Australia, but P2 (provisional-2) licence holders are allowed to drive vehicles with either transmission.
