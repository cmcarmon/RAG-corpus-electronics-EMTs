In order to illustrate the insensitivity of feedback circuits to variations of the op-amp parameters,
let us consider a simple feedback circuit using an op amp, as shown in Figure E5.3.1(a). Using
the op-amp model of Figure 5.1.1, Ô¨Ånd the output voltage in terms of the input voltage under two
sets of conditions:
