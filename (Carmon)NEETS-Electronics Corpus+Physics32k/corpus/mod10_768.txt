Nearby ships or parked aircraft are another source of rf energy that you must consider when you 
check a work area for safety. Combustible materials can be ignited and cause severe fires from arcs or 
heat generated by rf energy. Also, rf radiation can detonate ordnance devices by inducing currents in the 
internal wiring of the devices or in the external test equipment or leads connected to them.
