Donâ€™t  panic  if  the  ambiguity  of  this  answer  is 
worrying  you!  Reactance  in  an  AC  circuit  can  be 
either positive or negative depending upon whether 
the  component  in  question  is  an  inductor  or  a 
capacitor.  In  this  case,  the  numerical  value  of  the 
impedance  is  the  same  regardless  of  whether  the 
reactance is inductive or capacitive.
