Consider the case of a vehicle moving along a straight horizontal trajectory under the action of a driving force and gravity that sum to F. The constraint forces between the vehicle and the road define R, and we have





F

+

R

=
m




X

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} +\mathbf {R} =m{\ddot {\mathbf {X} }}.}

For convenience let the trajectory be along the X-axis, so X = (d, 0) and the velocity is V = (v, 0), then R ⋅ V = 0, and F ⋅ V = Fxv, where Fx is the component of F along the X-axis, so





F

{\displaystyle F_{x}v=m{\dot {v}}v.}

Integration of both sides yields

{\displaystyle \int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F_{x}vdt={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{1}).}

If Fx is constant along the trajectory, then the integral of velocity is distance, so

{\displaystyle F_{x}(d(t_{2})-d(t_{1}))={\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{2})-{\frac {m}{2}}v^{2}(t_{1}).}

As an example consider a car skidding to a stop, where k is the coefficient of friction and W is the weight of the car. Then the force along the trajectory is Fx = −kW. The velocity v of the car can be determined from the length s of the skid using the work–energy principle,

{\displaystyle kWs={\frac {W}{2g}}v^{2},\quad {\mbox{or}}\quad v={\sqrt {2ksg}}.}

Notice that this formula uses the fact that the mass of the vehicle is m = W/g.
