1. The design parameters of the fault-detection scheme,
such as the length of the time-shifting evaluating
window and threshold values, have direct effects on
the system performance. Short-evaluating window in
the fault-detection scheme may result in a sensitive
failure detector, while a long one may appear to be
too slow to take proper accommodation.
