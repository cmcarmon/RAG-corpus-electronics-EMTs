which is different at each decomposition level. The initial
threshold is chosen to be half the maximum magnitude at
ﬁrst decomposition level, whereas successive thresholds are
given by dividing the threshold at a previous decomposition
level by 2. During the coding process, a binary map called
signiﬁcant map is maintained so the coder knows the location
of signiﬁcant as well as insigniﬁcant coefﬁcients. To index
texture, a two-bin histogram of a wavelet coefﬁcient at each
sub band is formed with the count of signiﬁcant and insigniﬁ-
cant wavelet coefﬁcients in the two bins. For color content
representation, YUV color space is used. A nonuniform histo-
gram of 12 bins containing count of signiﬁcant coefﬁcients
given each of the 12 thresholds is computed for each color
channel. This way, three 12-bin histograms are computed for
luminance (Y) and chrominance (U and V) channels. For each
of the histograms, ﬁrst-, second-, and third-order moments
(mean, variance, and skewness) are computed and used as
indexing features for color.
