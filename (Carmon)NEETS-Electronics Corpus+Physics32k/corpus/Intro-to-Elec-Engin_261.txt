Figure 3.2.7 Graphic illustration of unit-impulse function. (a) A modiﬁed unit-step function in which the
transition from zero to unity is linear over a -second time interval. (b) Unit-step function: the graph of
part (a) as  → 0. (c) The derivative of the modiﬁed unit-step function depicted in part (a) (area enclosed
0+
= 1). (d) Unit-impulse function: the graph of part (c) as  → 0
