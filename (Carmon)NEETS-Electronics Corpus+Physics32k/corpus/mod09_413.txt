To determine what state the flip-flop is in, you can measure either the "1" or the "0" output. 
Measuring 0 volts at the "1" output indicates that the flip-flop is in the CLEAR state. If the "0" output is 
measured, a positive or negative voltage would also indicate that the flip-flop is in the CLEAR state. 
Either way, only one reading is necessary.
