between the particles. For molecules this is different. If we see a molecule as a rigid 3-D body, it has 6 degrees of freedom (3 degrees for its orientation and 3 degrees for its position in R3). The interaction energy of two molecules (a dimer) in isotropic and homogeneous space is in general a function of 2×6−6=6 degrees of freedom (by the homogeneity of space the interaction does not depend on the position of the center of mass of the dimer, and by the isotropy of space the interaction does not depend on the orientation of the dimer). The analytic description of the interaction of two arbitrarily shaped rigid molecules requires therefore 6 parameters. (One often uses two Euler angles per molecule, plus a dihedral angle, plus the distance.) The fact that the intermolecular interaction depends on the orientation of the molecules is expressed by stating that the potential is anisotropic. Since point charges are by definition spherical symmetric, their interaction is isotropic. Especially in the older literature, intermolecular interactions are regularly assumed to be isotropic (e.g., the potential is described in Lennard-Jones form, which depends only on distance).
Consider three arbitrary point charges at distances r12, r13, and r23 apart. The total interaction U is additive; i.e., it is the sum




U
=
u
(

r

12


)
+
u
(

r

13


)
+
u
(

r

23


)
.


{\displaystyle U=u(r_{12})+u(r_{13})+u(r_{23}).}

Again for molecules this can be different. Pretending that the interaction depends on distances only—but see above—the interaction of three molecules takes in general the form




U
=
u
(

r

12


)
+
u
(

r

13


)
+
u
(

r

23


)
+
u
(

r

,

r

,

r

23


)
,


{\displaystyle U=u(r_{12})+u(r_{13})+u(r_{23})+u(r_{12},r_{13},r_{23}),}

where



u
(

r

,

r

)


{\displaystyle u(r_{12},r_{13},r_{23})}
is a non-additive three-body interaction. Such an interaction can be caused by exchange interactions, by induction, and by dispersion (the Axilrod–Teller triple dipole effect).
