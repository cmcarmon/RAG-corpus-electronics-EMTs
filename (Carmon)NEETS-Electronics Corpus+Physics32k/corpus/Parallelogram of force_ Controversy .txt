The mathematical proof of the parallelogram of force is not generally accepted to be mathematically valid. Various proofs were developed (chiefly Duchayla's and Poisson's), and these also caused objections. That the parallelogram of force was true was not questioned; why it was true was. Today the parallelogram of force is accepted as an empirical fact, non-reducible to Newton's first principles.
