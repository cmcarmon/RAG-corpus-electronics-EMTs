current  is  changing.  An  example  of  a  constant 
quantity  might  be  the  speed  at  which  radio  waves 
travel in space. 
 
In either case, we use a symbol to represent the 
quantity. The symbol itself (often a single letter) is 
a form  of  shorthand  notation.  For  example,  in  the 
case  of  the  voltage  from  the  power  supply  we 
would  probably  use  v
to  represent  voltage.
Whereas,  in  the  case  of  the  speed  of  travel  of  a 
radio  wave  we  normally  use  c to  represent  the 
speed  of  radio  waves  in  space  (i.e.  the  speed  of 
light).  
  We can use letters to represent both variable and 
constant  quantities  in  mathematical  notation.  For 
example, the statement: 
 
voltage is equal to current multiplied by resistance 
can be written in mathematical notation as follows: 
 
V = I Ã— R
where  V represents  voltage,  I represents  current, 
and R represents resistance. 
  Similarly, the statement: 
 
resistance is equal to voltage divided by current 
can be written in mathematical notation as follows: 
 
VR
=
I
