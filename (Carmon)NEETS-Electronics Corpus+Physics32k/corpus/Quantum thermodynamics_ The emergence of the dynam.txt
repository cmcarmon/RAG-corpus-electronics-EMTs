There are seemingly two independent formulations of the third law of thermodynamics both originally were stated by Walther Nernst. The first formulation is known as the Nernst heat theorem, and can be phrased as:
The entropy of any pure substance in thermodynamic equilibrium approaches zero as the temperature approaches zero.
The second formulation is dynamical, known as the unattainability principle
It is impossible by any procedure, no matter how idealized, to reduce any assembly to absolute zero temperature in a finite number of operations.
At steady state the second law of thermodynamics implies that the total entropy production is non-negative. When the cold bath approaches the absolute zero temperature, it is necessary to eliminate the entropy production divergence at the cold side when

For



α

0


{\displaystyle \alpha =0}
the fulfillment of the second law depends on the entropy production of the other baths, which should compensate for the negative entropy production of the cold bath. The first formulation of the third law modifies this restriction. Instead of



α

0


{\displaystyle \alpha \geq 0}
the third law imposes



α

{\displaystyle \alpha >0}
, guaranteeing that at absolute zero the entropy production at the cold bath is zero:

The second formulation, known as the unattainability principle can be rephrased as;
No refrigerator can cool a system to absolute zero temperature at finite time.
The dynamics of the cooling process is governed by the equation

This equation introduces the relation between the characteristic exponents

and

{\displaystyle \zeta <0}
then the bath is cooled to zero temperature in a finite time, which implies a valuation of the third law. It is apparent from the last equation, that the unattainability principle is more restrictive than the Nernst heat theorem.
