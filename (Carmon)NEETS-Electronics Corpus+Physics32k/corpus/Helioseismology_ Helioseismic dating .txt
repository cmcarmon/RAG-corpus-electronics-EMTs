The age of the sun can be inferred with helioseismic studies.    This is because the propagation of acoustic waves deep within the sun depends on the composition of the sun, in particular the relative abundance of helium and hydrogen in the core. Since the sun has been fusing hydrogen into helium throughout its lifetime, the present day abundance of helium in the core can be used to infer the age of the sun, using numerical models of stellar evolution applied to the Sun (standard solar model). This method provides verification of the age of the solar system gathered from the radiometric dating of meteorites.
