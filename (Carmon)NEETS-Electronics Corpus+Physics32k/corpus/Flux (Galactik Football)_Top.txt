The Flux is a fictional fluid/force used in Galactik Football when in action, allowing players to perform amazing feats of acrobatic and athletic prowess. It is portrayed in Galactik Football as a constantly shifting aura around the person using it, and although its primary use is for physical enhancement (i.e. increased speed and strength), it can be used in many other ways.
According to what is mentioned in the series, each Flux is formed according to the nature, geology and even the shape of a planet.
Although players are able to control foreign Fluxes, they are usually seen falling ill when they overuse it, the mix most likely being too much for their body.
