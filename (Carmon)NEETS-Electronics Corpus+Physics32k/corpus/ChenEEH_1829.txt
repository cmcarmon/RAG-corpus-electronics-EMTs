(1) Topology-driven label assignment: In this assign-
ment, LSPs (for every possible FEC) are automatically
set up between every pair of LSR (full mesh). Thus,
this scheme can place a heavy demand on the usage of
labels at each LSR. However, the main advantage is
that there is no latency involved in setting up an LSP
before the trafﬁc ﬂow can use it (i.e., zero-call setup
delay).
