As with other feedback control systems, system stability is a major consideration. In spite of the extraordinary
adaptive properties intrinsic to human controllers, system instability is a rare but often unfavorable event. The
nature of such man-machine oscillations and the design steps required to avoid them is treated extensively in
 NASA Contractor Report 4683, July 1995.
