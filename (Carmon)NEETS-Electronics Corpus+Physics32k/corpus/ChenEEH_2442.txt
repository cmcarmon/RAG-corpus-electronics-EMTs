Dipole Antenna of Arbitrary Length
If the length of the dipole antenna is not electrically small, then
one can derive the radiation ﬁelds by slicing it into small pieces
and then superposing (integrating) the individual ﬁelds, if the
current distribution is known. This is shown in Figure 6.12.
Each piece can be modeled as a small dipole with a different
current of excitation and a different location.
