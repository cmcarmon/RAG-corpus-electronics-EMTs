In principle, quantum corrections to Maxwell's equations can cause the experimental electrical permittivity ε of the vacuum state to deviate from the defined scalar value ε0 of the electric constant. These theoretical developments are described, for example, in Dittrich and Gies. In particular, the theory of quantum electrodynamics predicts that the QED vacuum should exhibit nonlinear effects that will make it behave like a birefringent material with ε slightly greater than ε0 for extremely strong electric fields. Explanations for dichroism from particle physics, outside quantum electrodynamics, also have been proposed. Active attempts to measure such effects have yielded negative results so far.
