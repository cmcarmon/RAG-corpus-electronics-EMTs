Intrinsic Grid Velocity Anisotropy
Following Taﬂove and Hagness (2000), this section provides a
deeper discussion of the numerical phase–velocity errors of the
Yee algorithm. We will ﬁnd that the nature of the grid dis-
cretization, in a manner virtually independent of the time-
stepping scheme, determines the velocity anisotropy D~vvaniso.
