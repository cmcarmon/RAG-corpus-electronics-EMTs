A temperature gradient is a physical quantity that describes in which direction and at what rate the temperature changes the most rapidly around a particular location. The temperature gradient is a dimensional quantity expressed in units of degrees (on a particular temperature scale) per unit length. The SI unit is kelvin per meter (K/m).It can be also seen in the formula of dQ/dt i.e. the formula of rate of heat transfer per second.
Temperature gradients in the atmosphere are important in the atmospheric sciences (meteorology, climatology and related fields).
