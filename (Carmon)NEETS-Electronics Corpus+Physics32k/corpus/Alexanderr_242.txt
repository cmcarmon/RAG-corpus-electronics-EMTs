The concept of feedback is crucial to our understanding of op amp
circuits. A negative  feedback  is  achieved  when  the  output  is  fed  back
to the inverting terminal of the op amp. As Example 5.1 shows, when
there  is  a  feedback  path  from  output  to  input,  the  ratio  of  the  output
voltage to the input voltage is called the closed-loop gain. As a result
of the negative feedback, it can be shown that the closed-loop gain is
almost insensitive to the open-loop gain A of the op amp. For this rea-
son, op amps are used in circuits with feedback paths.
