In larger pieces of electronic equipment, the chas-
sis or metal frame serves as the ground point (refer-
ence point), as in the automobile. In smaller electronic 
devices, plastic is used for the chassis, and all compo-
nents are connected to a printed circuit board. In this 
case, ground is a copper pad on the circuit board that 
acts as a common point to the circuit.
