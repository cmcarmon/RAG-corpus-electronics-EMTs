EXAMPLE 16.1.4
A 440-V, 60-Hz, six-pole, wye-connected, squirrel-cage induction motor with a full-load speed
of 1170 r/min has the following parameters per phase referred to the stator: R1 = 0.2 , R
=
0.1 , Xl1 = 0.75 , X
and Xm = 20 . (See Chapter 13, Figure 13.2.6,
for the notation.) Consider the motor to be fed by a six-step inverter, which in turn is fed by a
six-pulse, fully controlled rectiÔ¨Åer.
