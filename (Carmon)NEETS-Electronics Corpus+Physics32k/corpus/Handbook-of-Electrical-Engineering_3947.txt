Characterization of Passive Elements
Passive microwave elements are deﬁned in terms of their reﬂection and transmission properties for an incident
wave of electric ﬁeld or voltage. Scattering (S) parameters are based on traveling waves and so naturally describe
these  properties.  As  well  they  are  the  only  ones  that  can  be  measured  directly  at  microwave  frequencies.  S
parameters are deﬁned in terms of root power waves which in turn are deﬁned using forward and backward
