transmit tiny signals and boost them when you need them to make 
something happen.
For instance, radio waves carry tiny audio signals over long distances, 
and itâ€™s up to the amplifier in your stereo system to magnify the signal so 
it can move the diaphragm of a speaker so you can hear the sound.
