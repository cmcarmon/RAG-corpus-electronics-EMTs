The two sciences mentioned in the title are the strength of materials and the motion of objects (the forbearers of modern material engineering and kinematics). In the title of the book "mechanics" and "motion" are separate, since at Galileo's time "mechanics" meant only statics and strength of materials.
Galileo had started an additional section on the force of percussion, but was not able to complete it to his own satisfaction.
