The "Betz limit," not yet taking advantage of Betz' contribution to account for rotational flow with emphasis on propellers, applies the Rankine–Froude "actuator disk" theory to obtain the maximum efficiency of a stationary wind turbine. The following analysis is restricted to axial motion of the air:

In our streamtube we have fluid flowing from left to right, and an actuator disk that represents the rotor. We will assume that the rotor is infinitesimally thin. From above, we can see that at the start of the streamtube, fluid flow is normal to the actuator disk. The fluid interacts with the rotor, thus transferring energy from the fluid to the rotor. The fluid then continues to flow downstream. Thus we can break our system/streamtube into two sections: pre-acuator disk, and post-actuator disk. Before interaction with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant. Furthermore, after interacting with the rotor, the total energy in the fluid is constant.
Bernoulli's equation describes the different forms of energy that are present in fluid flow where the net energy is constant i.e. when a fluid is not transferring any energy to some other entity such as a rotor. The energy consists of static pressure, gravitational potential energy, and kinetic energy. Mathematically, we have the following expression:

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}+P+\rho gh=\mathrm {const.} }

where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid,



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline,



P


{\displaystyle P}
is the static pressure energy,



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the height above the ground. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume that gravitational potential energy is unchanging during fluid flow from left to right such that we have the following:

P

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}+P=\mathrm {const.} }

Thus, if we have two points on a streamline, point 1 and point 2, and at point 1 the velocity of the fluid along the streamline is




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and the pressure at 1 is




P

1




{\displaystyle P_{1}}
, and at point 2 the velocity of the fluid along the streamline is




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
and the pressure at 2 is




P

2




{\displaystyle P_{2}}
, and no energy has been extracted from the fluid between points 1 and 2, then we have the following expression:

Now let us return to our initial diagram. Consider pre-actuator flow. Far upstream, the fluid velocity is




v

∞




{\displaystyle v_{\infty }}
; the fluid then expands as it approaches the rotor. In accordance with mass conservation, the mass flow rate must be constant. The mass flow rate,






m
˙





{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}}
, through a surface of area



A


{\displaystyle A}
is given by the following expression:







m
˙



=
ρ
A
v


{\displaystyle {\dot {m}}=\rho Av}

where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density and



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline. Thus, if mass flow rate is constant, increases in area must result in decreases in fluid velocity along a streamline. This means the kinetic energy of the fluid is decreasing. If the flow is expanding but not transferring energy, then Bernoulli applies. Thus the reduction in kinetic energy is countered by an increase in static pressure energy. Why a streamtube expands as it approaches an object is not explained in this document.
So we have the following situation pre-rotor: far upstream, fluid pressure is the same as atmospheric,




P

∞




{\displaystyle P_{\infty }}
; just before interaction with the rotor, fluid pressure has increased and so kinetic energy has decreased. This can be described mathematically using Bernoulli's equation:

where we have written the fluid velocity at the rotor as




v

(

)


{\displaystyle v_{\infty }(1-a)}
, where



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the axial induction factor. The pressure of the fluid on the upstream side of the actuator disk is




P

D
+




{\displaystyle P_{D+}}
. We are treating the rotor as an actuator disk that is infinitely thin. Thus we will assume no change in fluid velocity across the actuator disk. Since energy has been extracted from the fluid, the pressure must have decreased.
Now let us consider post-rotor: immediately after interacting with the rotor, the fluid velocity is still




v

(

{\displaystyle v_{\infty }(1-a)}
, but the pressure has dropped to a value

{\displaystyle P_{D-}}
; far downstream, pressure of the fluid has reached equilibrium with the atmosphere; this has been accomplished in the natural and dynamically slow process of decreasing the velocity of flow in the stream tube in order to maintain dynamic equilibrium ( i.e.

{\displaystyle P\rightarrow P_{\infty }}

If we have a pressure difference across the area of the actuator disc, there is a force acting on the actuator disk, which can be determined from

where

{\displaystyle A_{D}}
is the area of the actuator disk. If the rotor is the only thing absorbing energy from the fluid, the rate of change in axial momentum of the fluid is the force that is acting on the rotor. The rate of change of axial momentum can be expressed as the difference between the initial and final axial velocities of the fluid, multiplied by the mass flow rate:
