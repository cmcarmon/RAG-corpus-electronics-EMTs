Capacitor C2 cannot begin to charge until after C1 has charged. No current can flow beyond points
A and B until C1 has acquired some charge. As the voltage across C1 increases, current through L2 and
C2 charges C2. This action continues down the line and charges each capacitor, in turn, to the battery
voltage. Thus a voltage wave is traveling along the line. Beyond the wavefront, the line is uncharged.
Since the line is infinitely long, there will always be more capacitors to be charged, and current will not
stop flowing. Thus current will flow indefinitely in the line.
