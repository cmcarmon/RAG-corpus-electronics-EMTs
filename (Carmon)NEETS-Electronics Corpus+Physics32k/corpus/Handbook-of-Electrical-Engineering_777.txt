As  observed  in  the  preceding  section,  ideal  ﬁlters  cannot  be  utilized  in  real-time  ﬁltering  applications,  since
, which are necessarily nonideal; that is,
they are noncausal. In such applications, one must use 
the  transition  from  the  passband  to  the  stopband  (and  vice  versa)  is  gradual.  In  particular,  the  magnitude
functions  of  causal  versions  of  low-pass,  high-pass,  bandpass,  and  bandstop  ﬁlters  have  gradual  transitions
from the passband to the stopband. Examples of magnitude functions for the basic ﬁlter types are shown in
Fig. 10.5.
