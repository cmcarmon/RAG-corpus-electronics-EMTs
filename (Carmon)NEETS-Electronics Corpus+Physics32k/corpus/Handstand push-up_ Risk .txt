Caution should be taken not to have one's body suspended in an upside-down position for very long periods of time, since the human body lacks a design for forcing back blood that's running to the head (something intended by force of gravity to take care of itself). While small bouts of hanging upside down have not proven to be dangerous, people with pre-existing conditions for example could make matters worse and potentially increase the risk of, among others, stroke and pulmonary oedema.
