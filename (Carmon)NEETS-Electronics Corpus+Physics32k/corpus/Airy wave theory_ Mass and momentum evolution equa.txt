For slowly varying bathymetry, wave and mean-flow fields, the evolution of the mean flow can de described in terms of the mean mass-transport velocity






U
~





{\displaystyle {\tilde {\boldsymbol {U}}}}
defined as:







U
~




=


U


+



M

ρ

h



.


{\displaystyle {\tilde {\boldsymbol {U}}}\,=\,{\boldsymbol {U}}\,+\,{\frac {\boldsymbol {M}}{\rho \,h}}.}

Note that for deep water, when the mean depth h goes to infinity, the mean Eulerian velocity




U



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {U}}}
and mean transport velocity






U

{\displaystyle {\tilde {\boldsymbol {U}}}}
become equal.
The equation for mass conservation is:

where h(x,t) is the mean water-depth, slowly varying in space and time. Similarly, the mean horizontal momentum evolves as:

with d the still-water depth (the sea bed is at z=–d),

Note that mean horizontal momentum is only conserved if the sea bed is horizontal (i.e. the still-water depth d is a constant), in agreement with Noether's theorem.
The system of equations is closed through the description of the waves. Wave energy propagation is described through the wave-action conservation equation (without dissipation and nonlinear wave interactions):

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left({\frac {E}{\sigma }}\,\right)+\,\nabla \cdot \left[\left({\boldsymbol {U}}+{\boldsymbol {c}}_{g}\right)\,{\frac {E}{\sigma }}\right]\,=\,0.}

The wave kinematics are described through the wave-crest conservation equation:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {k}}}{\partial t}}\,+\,\nabla \omega \,=\,{\boldsymbol {0}},}

with the angular frequency ω a function of the (angular) wavenumber k, related through the dispersion relation. For this to be possible, the wave field must be coherent. By taking the curl of the wave-crest conservation, it can be seen that an initially irrotational wavenumber field stays irrotational.
