Piezoelectric Effect
Piezoelectric property
 of a material refers to the ability to induce opposite charges at two faces (correspondingly,
to  exhibit  a  voltage  difference  between  the  faces)  of  the  material  as  a  result  of  the  strain  due  to  mechanical
force  (either  tension  or  compression)  applied  across  the  surfaces.  This  process  is  also  reversible  in  the  sense
that a mechanical strain would be experienced in the material when subjected to opposite electric charging at
the two faces by means of an applied potential.
