We  frequently  need  to  solve  equations  in  order  to 
find  the  value  of  an  unknown  quantity.  Any 
arithmetic operation may be applied to an equation 
as 
is 
maintained.  In  other  words,  the  same  operation 
must  be  applied  to  both  the  left-hand  side  (LHS) 
and the right-hand side (RHS) of the equation.
