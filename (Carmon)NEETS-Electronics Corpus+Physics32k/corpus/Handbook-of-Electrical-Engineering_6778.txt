It is conceivable that the database in this architecture could reside in the switching system, and the signaling
network in this instance would not be required. However, that would magnify the task of administering the
customer information, since that information would be contained in thousands of switches instead of dozens
of centralized databases. In addition, even more importantly, there are two shortcomings associated with basing
many of the potential new services in switches, rather than utilizing centralized databases to provide information
for the switches. The ﬁrst is a deployment problem. As of 1990 there were more than 15,000 switches in the
United States, and a single switch can cost millions of dollars. To introduce a new service in local switches and
to make it widely available generally requires some not-so-simple changes in those switches or, in some cases,
replacement of certain switch types altogether. These switch modiﬁcations typically take years to implement
and require a tremendous capital investment. As a result, ten years after introduction, Custom Calling services
were available to fewer than 1% of the residential customers in the United States.
