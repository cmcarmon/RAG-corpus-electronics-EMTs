There are four basic types of ﬁlters classiﬁed according to
the frequency response: low-pass, band-pass, band-stop or
stopband (also called band rejection or notch), and high-
pass ﬁlters. They are illustrated in Figure 7.33. An ideally
lossless ﬁlter has zero transmission loss and inﬁnite out-of-
band rejection as well as abrupt band response. Practically, a
ﬁlter always presents a loss-related degradation of perform-
ance, and it also exhibits unwanted spurious responses beyond
a certain limit of the frequency range of interest.
