Various modiﬁcations of the multiplication algorithm exist; one of the most famous is the modiﬁed Booth
recoding algorithm described by Booth in 1951. This algorithm allows for the reduction of the number of partial
products,  thus  speeding  up  the  multiplication  process.  Generally  speaking,  the  Booth  algorithm  is  a  case  of
using the redundant number system with the radix higher than 2.
