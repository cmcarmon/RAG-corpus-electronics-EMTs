As optical lithography is pushed to its limits in imaging ever smaller features using illumination wavelengths
that are not easily reduced, simulation is playing an increasingly important role in the development of resolu-
tion-enhancement techniques such as optical-proximity-correction (OPC) features, phase shift masks, and off-
axis illumination.
