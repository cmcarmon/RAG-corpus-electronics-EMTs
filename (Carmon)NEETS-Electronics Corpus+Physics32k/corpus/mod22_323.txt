Regardless of the language used, there are strict rules the programmer must adhere to with regard to 
punctuation and statement structure when coding any program. Using the programming flowchart 
introduced earlier, we have now added a program coded in BASIC to show the relationship of the 
flowchart to the actual coded instructions (fig. 3-7). Don't worry about complete understanding, just look 
at the instructions with the flowchart to get an idea of what coded instructions look like.
