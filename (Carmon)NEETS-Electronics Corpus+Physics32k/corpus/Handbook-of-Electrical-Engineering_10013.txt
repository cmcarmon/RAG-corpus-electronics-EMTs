Various graphical procedures have been proposed for solving the two nonlinear algebraic equations resulting
from Eq. (100.132) [Levinson, 1953; Singh, 1965; West and Douce, 1954]. If the system is lightly damped, the
nonlinear equations may have more than one solution, indicating that the frequency response of the system
has  a  jump  resonance.  This  phenomenon  of  a  nonlinear  system  has  been  studied  by  many  authors,  both
theoretically and practically [Lamba and Kavanagh, 1971; West et al., 1954].
