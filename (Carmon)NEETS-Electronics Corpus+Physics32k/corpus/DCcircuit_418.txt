The beneﬁts of scientiﬁc notation do not end with ease of writing and expression of accuracy.
Such notation also lends itself well to mathematical problems of multiplication and division.
Let’s say we wanted to know how many electrons would ﬂow past a point in a circuit carrying
1 amp of electric current in 25 seconds. If we know the number of electrons per second in the
circuit (which we do), then all we need to do is multiply that quantity by the number of seconds
(25) to arrive at an answer of total electrons:
