In addition to the pn junction, there are a number of other ways to make semiconductor diode junctions.
These approaches, in addition to the pn or homojunction, are heterojunction, metal/semiconductor junction,
metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS), semiconductor/insulator/semiconductor (SIS), and electrolyte/semicon-
ductor.
