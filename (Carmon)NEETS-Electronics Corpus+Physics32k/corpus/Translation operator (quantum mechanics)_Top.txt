In quantum mechanics, a translation operator is defined as an operator which shifts particles and fields by a certain amount in a certain direction. More specifically, for any displacement vector




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
, there is a corresponding translation operator






T
^



(

x

)


{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )}
that shifts particles and fields by the amount




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
. For example, if






T
^



(

x

)


{\displaystyle {\hat {T}}(\mathbf {x} )}
acts on a particle located at position




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
, the result is a particle at position




(
r
+
x
)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {(r+x)} }
.
Translation operators are unitary. They are closely related to the momentum operator; for example, a translation operator that moves by an infinitesimal amount in the



y


{\displaystyle y}
direction has a simple relationship to the



y


{\displaystyle y}
-component of the momentum operator. Because of this, conservation of momentum holds when the translation operators commute with the Hamiltonian, i.e. when laws of physics are translation-invariant. This is an example of Noether's theorem.
