Trace gas exchanges between the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere occur due to large air mass movements. Among these, one of the most important is the Asian monsoon circulation pattern. This way, pollutants (and among them, trace gases) from Asia, India and Indonesia reach the stratosphere. Regarding the horizontal spread, the extratropical air in the stratosphere, is mixed towards the equator at the outer edge of the Asian monsoon anticyclone, thus affecting the concentration of trace gases in the area.
