The  main  cause  of  momentary  voltage  dips  is  probably  the  lightning  strike.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the
voltage drops to about 80% of its nominal value. In terms of duration, dips tend to cluster around three values:
4  cycles  (the  typical  clearing  time  for  faults),  30  cycles  (the  instantaneous  reclosing  time  for  breakers),  and
120 cycles (the delayed reclosing time of breakers). The effect of a voltage dip on equipment depends on both
its magnitude and its duration; in about 42% of the cases observed to date they are severe enough to exceed
the tolerance standard adopted by computer manufacturers.
