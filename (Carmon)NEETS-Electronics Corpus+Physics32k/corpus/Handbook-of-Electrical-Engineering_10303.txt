Figure 102.5 shows a simpliﬁed block diagram of a typical satellite. A matrix-type switching arrangement is
provided  on  the  input  and  output  of  the  transmitter  subsystem  for  switching  to  backup  transponders.  This
satellite is three-axis stabilized and operates at Ku-band. There are 16 operational transponders with a bandwidth
of 54 MHz each. The employment of frequency reuse provides nearly 1000 MHz of usable bandwidth. Fourteen
of  the  16  operational  transponders  use  20-W  traveling  wave  tube  ampliﬁers  (TWTA)  to  provide  ground-
commandable east or west regional coverage, for 48-state (CONUS) coverage. The remaining two transponders
provide  50-state  coverage  using  27-W  TWTAs.  For  the  50-state  channels,  one  spare  27-W  TWTA  provides
