• It must determine when bit boundaries occur: The receiver needs to synchronize with the transmitted
signal. Because transmitter and receiver are designed in concert, both use the same value for the bit
interval T . Synchronization can occur because the transmitter begins sending with a reference bit
sequence, known as the preamble. This reference bit sequence is usually the alternating sequence
as shown in the square wave example20 and in the FSK example (Figure 6.13). The receiver knows
what the preamble bit sequence is and uses it to determine when bit boundaries occur. This procedure
amounts to what in digital hardware as self-clocking signaling: The receiver of a bit stream must
derive the clock — when bit boundaries occur — from its input signal. Because the receiver usually
does not determine which bit was sent until synchronization occurs, it does not know when during the
preamble it obtained synchronization. The transmitter signals the end of the preamble by switching
to a second bit sequence. The second preamble phase informs the receiver that data bits are about to
come and that the preamble is almost over.
• Once synchronized and data bits are transmitted, the receiver must then determine every T seconds
what bit was transmitted during the previous bit interval. We focus on this aspect of the digital
receiver because this strategy is also used in synchronization.
