which corresponds to the representation described in a problem (Example 5.6) of a length-q boxcar ﬁlter.
Solution to Exercise 5.31 (p. 173)
The unit-sample response’s duration is q + 1 and the signal’s Nx. Thus the statement is correct.
Solution to Exercise 5.32 (p. 177)
Let N denote the input’s total duration. The time-domain implementation requires a total of N (2q + 1)
computations, or 2q + 1 computations per input value. In the frequency domain, we split the input into N
Nx
per input in the section. Because we divide again
sections, each of which requires log2 (Nx + q) + 6 +
by Nx to ﬁnd the number of computations per input value in the entire input, this quantity decreases as
Nx increases. For the time-domain implementation, it stays constant.
