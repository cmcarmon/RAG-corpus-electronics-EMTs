Given a dynamical system (T, M, Φ) with T a group, M a set and Φ the evolution function




Φ
:
U
→
M


{\displaystyle \Phi :U\to M}
where



U
⊂
T
×
M


{\displaystyle U\subset T\times M}
with



Φ
(
0
,
x
)
=
x


{\displaystyle \Phi (0,x)=x}

we define




I
(
x
)
:=
{
t
∈
T
:
(
t
,
x
)
∈
U
}
,


{\displaystyle I(x):=\{t\in T:(t,x)\in U\},}

then the set





γ

x


:=
{
Φ
(
t
,
x
)
:
t
∈
I
(
x
)
}
⊂
M


{\displaystyle \gamma _{x}:=\{\Phi (t,x):t\in I(x)\}\subset M}

is called orbit through x. An orbit which consists of a single point is called constant orbit. A non-constant orbit is called closed or periodic if there exists a



t
≠
0


{\displaystyle t\neq 0}
in



I
(
x
)


{\displaystyle I(x)}
such that




Φ
(
t
,
x
)
=
x


{\displaystyle \Phi (t,x)=x}
.
