Using bispectral analysis, the existence of signiﬁcant quadratic phase coupling (QPC) in the hippocampal
EEG obtained during REM sleep in the adult rat was demonstrated [Ning and Bronzino, 1989a,b, 1990]. The
result  of  this  nonlinear  coupling  is  the  appearance,  in  the  frequency  spectrum,  of  a  small  peck  centered  at
approximately 13 to 14 Hz (beta range) that reﬂects the summation of the two theta frequency (i.e., in the 6-
to 7-Hz range) waves. Conventional power spectral (linear) approaches are incapable of distinguishing the fact
that this peak results from the interaction of these two generators and is not intrinsic to either.
