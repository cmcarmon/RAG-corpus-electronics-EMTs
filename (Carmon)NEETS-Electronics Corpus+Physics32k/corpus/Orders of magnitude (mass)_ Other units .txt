Other units of mass are also in use. Historical units include the stone, the pound, the carat, and the grain.
For subatomic particles, physicists use the mass equivalent to the energy represented by an electronvolt (eV). At the atomic level, chemists use the mass of one-twelfth of a carbon-12 atom (the dalton). Astronomers use the mass of the sun (Mâ˜‰).
