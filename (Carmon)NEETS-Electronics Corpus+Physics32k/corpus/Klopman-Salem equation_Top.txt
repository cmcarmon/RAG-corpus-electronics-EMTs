The Klopman-Salem equation describes the energetic change that occurs when two chemical species react and their associated molecular orbitals interact with each other. First described independently by Klopman and Salem in 1968, this relationship provides a mathematical basis for the key assumptions of frontier molecular orbital theory (i.e., theory of HOMO-LUMO interactions) and hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory.
