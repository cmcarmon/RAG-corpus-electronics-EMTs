Determine the efﬁciency of the generator at rated
load, rated voltage, and 0.8 power factor lagging.
13.3.4 A three-phase, six-pole, wye-connected syn-
chronous generator is rated at 550 V and has
a synchronous reactance Xs = 2 . When the
generator supplies 50 kVA at rated voltage and
a power factor of 0.95 lagging, ﬁnd the arma-
ture current Ia and the excitation voltage Ef .
