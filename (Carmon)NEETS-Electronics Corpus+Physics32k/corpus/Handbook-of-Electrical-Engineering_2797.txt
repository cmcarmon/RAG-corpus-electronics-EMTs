Another  issue  in  power  distribution  concerns  ground  bounce  (or  simultaneous  switching  noise),  which  is
increasingly problematic as the number of ASIC I/O data pins increases. Consider M output lines switching
simultaneously to the 1 state, each of those lines outputting a current transient I(out) within a time t(out). (If
M output lines switch simultaneously to the 0 state, then a corresponding input current transient is produced.)
The  net  output  current  M  ·  I(out)  is  fed  through  the  Vdd  pin  (returned  to  ground  in  the  case  of  outputs
switching to 0). With an inductance L associated with the Vdd pin, a transient voltage DV » L · M · I(out)/t(out)
is imposed on Vdd. A similar effect occurs on the ground connection for outputs switching to 0. With a total
output  current  of  200 mA/ns  and  a  ground  pin  inductance  of  5  nH,  the  voltage  transient  is  about  1 V.  The
voltage  transient  propagates  through  the  IC,  potentially  causing  logic  blocks  to  fail  to  produce  the  correct
outputs. The transient voltage can be reduced by reducing the power line inductance L, for example by replacing
