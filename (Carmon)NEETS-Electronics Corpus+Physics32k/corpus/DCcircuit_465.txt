In summary, a series circuit is deﬁned as having only one path for electrons to ﬂow. From
this deﬁnition, three rules of series circuits follow: all components share the same current;
resistances add to equal a larger, total resistance; and voltage drops add to equal a larger, total
voltage. All of these rules ﬁnd root in the deﬁnition of a series circuit. If you understand that
deﬁnition fully, then the rules are nothing more than footnotes to the deﬁnition.
