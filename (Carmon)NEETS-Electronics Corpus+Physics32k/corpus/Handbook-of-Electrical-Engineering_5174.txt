Shape-Memory Effects-Based Sensors
The  latest  form  of  sensing  technology  utilizes  shape-memory  materials,  namely,  Nitinol  alloys.  The  Nitinol
sensors are used to measure strain and consist of superelastic Nitinol wires. The basic concept is to measure
the change in resistance of a Nitinol wire used as an unbalanced arm of a Wheatstone bridge as a function of
the strain. The desirable properties of Nitinol in such a sensing application are its high sensitivity and super-
elastic nature (which permits strains up to 6% to be accurately and repeatedly measured). The piezoelectric
and Nitinol sensing materials can also be used for actuation applications.
