Strategic communications are generally world-wide in nature. They are operated on a common-user 
(Navy, Army, Department of Defense, and so on) or special-purpose basis. A strategic system may be 
confined within a specified area or limited to a specific type of traffic, but the configuration is designed so 
that combined operations with other strategic systems are possible. As an example, we will look at the 
automatic voice network, automatic digital network, and the defense special security communications 
system later in this chapter.
