The law of attraction states that whatever someone experiences in life is a direct result of their thoughts. Byrne's states that it really is that simple. According to The Secret and The Power, one's thoughts and feelings have "magnetic properties" and "frequencies". They vibrate and resonate with the universe, somehow attracting events that share those frequencies. The three rules of the Law of Attraction, according to Byrne are the following: "Ask", "Believe", and "Receive". As Byrne says, it means that: "Like attracts like. What that means in simple terms for your life is: what you give out, you receive back. Whatever you give out in life is what you receive back in life. Whatever you give, by the law of attraction, is exactly what you attract back to yourself." In other words, if you want good things to happen, be a good person, think positive thoughts.
