In nuclear reactor engineering, a per cent mille is equal to one-thousandth of a percent of the reactivity, denoted by Greek lowercase letter rho. Reactivity is a dimensionless unit representing a departure from criticality, calculated by:




ρ
=

k

e
f

)

/


k

f
f




{\displaystyle \rho =(k_{eff}-1)/k_{eff}}

where keff denotes the effective multiplication factor for the reaction. Therefore, one pcm is equal to:

{\displaystyle 1pcm=\rho *10^{5}}

This unit is commonly used in the operation of light-water reactor sites because reactivity values tend to be small, so measuring in pcm allows reactivity to be expressed using whole numbers.
