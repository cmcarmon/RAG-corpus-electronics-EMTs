Automotive manufacturers are striving to meet growing demand for lighter and more fuel-efficient vehicles and evaluate components and materials used in various car applications. Composite bearings are useful components in automotive design and are used in a range of applications throughout the car, from the powertrain to the car interior. In addition to enhancing automotive performance, composite bearingsâ€™ split ring design allows them to be press fitted, without the need for adhesive or excessive assembly force.
