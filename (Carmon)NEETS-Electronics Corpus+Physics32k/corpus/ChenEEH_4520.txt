The ﬁrst identiﬁcation target is a 16-story steel structure model
shown in Figure 6.2. The system is excited by impulse
force produced by a PCB hammer and applied individually
at the 16th, 12th, 8th, and 4th ﬂoors. The accelerations of
these ﬂoors are selected as the system measurement outputs
and are sensed by PCB accelerometers. The goal of the identi-
