The “brute force” method for determining the response of a circuit to an arbitrary 
signal is to write a system of linear differential equations using the voltage and current 
variables in the circuit and then to solve for the output signal, using the input signals as 
the forcing functions. The Laplace transform simplifies this process by converting linear 
differential equations in the time domain to algebraic equations in the complex frequency 
domain. The independent variable in the complex frequency domain is s, where
