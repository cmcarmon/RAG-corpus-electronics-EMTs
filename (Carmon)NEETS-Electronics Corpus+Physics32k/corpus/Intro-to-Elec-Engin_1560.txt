15.2.19 An FM station’s modulator has a sensitivity kFM =
5π × 104 rad/s·V. A receiver uses a discriminator
−5/π V·s/rad. Ne-
that has a gain constant of 10
glecting noise, determine the signal at the receiver
output.
15.2.20 A voice message with Wf = 2π(3×103) rad/s and
Wrms = 2π(1 × 103) rad/s is transmitted over an
FM broadcast system with standard emphasis. See
Example 15.2.2, and compare the improvements
due to emphasis.
