A synodic day is the period it takes for a planet to rotate once in relation to the body it is orbiting. For Earth, the synodic day is known as a solar day, and is about 24 hours long.
The synodic day is distinguished from the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to distant stars. A synodic day is from "sunrise to sunrise'", usually taken as a mean, whereas a sidereal day is from the rise of any very distant star to the rise of the same star on the next day (thus the word day denotes its position relative to the main "parent" star which the observer is orbiting). These two quantities are not equal because of the movement of the body of the observer around its parent star.
Seen from Earth, the Sun appears to slowly move in front of a fixed sphere of stars along an imaginary track known as the ecliptic. In one synodic day this movement is a little less than one degree toward the east (360 degrees/year)/(365.25 days/year), in a manner known as prograde motion.
Although correct, neither mean term precisely coincides with the rising or setting of either celestial body because of variations due to the Earth's tilt. See the equation of time.
