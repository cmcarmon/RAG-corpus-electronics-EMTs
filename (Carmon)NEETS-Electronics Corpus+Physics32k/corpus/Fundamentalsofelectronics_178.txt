3.8 Circuits with Capacitors and Inductors17
Letâ€™s consider a circuit having something other than resistors and sources, such as shown in Figure 3.21.
dt vout,
Because of KVL, we know that vin = vR + vout. The current through the capacitor is given by i = C d
and this current equals that passing through the resistor. Substituting vR = Ri into the KVL equation and
using the v-i relation for the capacitor, we arrive at
