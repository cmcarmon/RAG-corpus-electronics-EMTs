Some ring-liquid is also entrained with the discharge stream. This liquid is separated from the gas stream by other equipment external to the pump. In some systems, the discharged ring-liquid is cooled by a heat exchanger or cooling tower, then returned to the pump casing. In some recirculating systems, contaminants from the gas become trapped in the ring-liquid, depending on system configuration. These contaminants become concentrated as the liquid continues to recirculate, eventually causes damage and reduced life to the pump. In this case, filtration systems are required to ensure that contamination is kept to acceptable levels.
In non-recirculating systems, the discharged hot liquid (usually water) is treated as a waste stream. In this case fresh cool water is used to make up the loss. Environmental considerations are making such "once-through" systems increasingly rare. These simple, but highly reliable pumps have a variety of industrial applications. They are used to maintain condenser vacuum on large steam-turbine generator sets by removing incondensable gasses, where vacuum levels are typically 30â€“50 mbar. They are used on paper machines to dewater the pulp slurry and to extract water from press felts. Another application is the vacuum forming of molded paper-pulp products (egg cartons and other packaging). Other applications include soil remediation, where contaminated ground water is drawn from wells by vacuum. In petroleum refining, vacuum distillation also makes use of liquid-ring vacuum pumps to provide the process vacuum. Liquid-ring compressors are often used in vapor recovery systems.
