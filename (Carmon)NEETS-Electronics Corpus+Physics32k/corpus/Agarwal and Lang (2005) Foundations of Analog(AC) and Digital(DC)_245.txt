A simple electrical network made from a voltage source and four resistors is
shown in Figure 2.1. This might be an abstract representation of some real
electrical network, or a model of some other physical system, for example, a
heat flow problem in a house. We wish to develop systematic general methods
for analyzing circuits such as this, so that circuits of arbitrary complexity can
be solved with dispatch. Solving or analyzing a circuit generally involves finding
the voltage across, and current through, each of the circuit elements. Systematic
general methods will also enable us to automate the solution techniques so that
computers can be used to analyze circuits. Later on in this chapter and in the
next, we will show how our problem formulation facilitates direct computer
analysis.
