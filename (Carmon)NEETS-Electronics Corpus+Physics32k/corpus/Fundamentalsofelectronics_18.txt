1.2 Signals Represent Information5
Whether analog or digital, information is represented by the fundamental quantity in electrical engineering:
the signal. Stated in mathematical terms, a signal is merely a function. Analog signals are continuous-
valued; digital signals are discrete-valued. The independent variable of the signal could be time (speech, for
example), space (images), or the integers (denoting the sequencing of letters and numbers in the football
score).
1.2.1 Analog Signals
Analog signals are usually signals deÔ¨Åned over continuous independent variable(s). Speech, as
described in Section 4.10, is produced by your vocal cords exciting acoustic resonances in your vocal tract.
The result is pressure waves propagating in the air, and the speech signal thus corresponds to a function
having independent variables of space and time and a value corresponding to air pressure: s (x, t) (Here we
use vector notation x to denote spatial coordinates). When you record someone talking, you are evaluating
the speech signal at a particular spatial location, x0 say. An example of the resulting waveform s (x0, t) is
shown in Figure 1.1.
