Microcontrollers
One of the most versatile integrated circuits you can find is the microcon-
troller. A microcontroller is a small, complete computer on a chip. To program 
it, you place it on a development board that allows the IC to interface with 
your personal computer. After it’s programmed, you mount the microcon-
troller into a socket on your electronic device (which could be a  solderless 
breadboard). You add a few other components to provide an interface 
between the microcontroller and LEDs, motors, or switches — and voilà! 
Your little programmed IC makes things happen (for instance, it can control 
the motion of a robot). The nice thing about a microcontroller is that you can 
simply alter a few lines of code (or reprogram it completely) to change what 
it does; you don’t need to swap out wires, resistors, and other  components to 
get this flexible IC to take on a new  personality.
