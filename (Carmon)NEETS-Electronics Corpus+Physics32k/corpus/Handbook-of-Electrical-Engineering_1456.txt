Feature extraction for speech recognition involves computing sequences of numeric measurements, or feature
vectors, which typically approximate the envelope of the speech spectrum. Spectral features can be extracted
directly  from  the  discrete  Fourier  transform  (DFT)  or  computed  using  linear  predictive  coding  (LPC)  tech-
niques. Cepstral analysis can also be used to deconvolve the spectral envelope and the periodic voicing source.
Each feature vector is computed from a frame of speech data deÔ¨Åned by windowing N samples of the signal.
While  a  better  spectral  estimate  can  be  obtained  using  more  samples,  the  interval  must  be  short  enough  so
that the windowed signal is roughly stationary. For speech data, N is chosen such that the length of the interval
covered by the window is approximately 25 to 30 msec. The feature vectors are typically computed at a frame
rate  of  10  to  20  msec  by  shifting  the  window  forward  in  time.  Tapered  windowing  functions,  such  as  the
Hamming window, are used to reduce dependence of the spectral estimate on the exact temporal position of
