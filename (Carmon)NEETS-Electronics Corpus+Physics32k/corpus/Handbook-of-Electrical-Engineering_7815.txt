In optical recording it is most desirable to have a beam with
circular  cross  section.  The  need  for  shaping  the  beam  arises
from the special geometry of the laser cavity with its rectan-
gular  cross  section.  Since  the  emerging  beam  has  different
dimensions in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the
junction, its cross section at the collimator becomes elliptical,
with the initially narrow dimension expanding more rapidly
to become the major axis of the ellipse. The collimating lens
thus  produces  a  beam  with  elliptical  cross  section.  Circular-
ization may be achieved by bending various rays of the beam
at a prism, as shown in Fig. 80.24(c). The bending changes the
beamâ€™s diameter in the plane of incidence but leaves the diam-
eter in the perpendicular direction intact.
