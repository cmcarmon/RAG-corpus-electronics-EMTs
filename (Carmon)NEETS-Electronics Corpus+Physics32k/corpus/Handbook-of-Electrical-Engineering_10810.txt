It is useful to think of DFE within the ﬁrm as encompassing two different groups of activities as shown in
Fig. 111.2. In all cases, DFE activities require inclusion of life-cycle considerations in the analytical process. The
ﬁrst,  which  might  be  styled “generic  DFE”,  involves  the  implementation  of  broad  programs  that  make  the
company’s  operations  more  environmentally  preferable  across  the  board.  This  might  include,  for  example,
development and implementation of ‘‘green accounting” practices, which ensure that relevant environmental
costs are broken out by product line and process, so that they can be managed down. The “standard components”
lists  maintained  by  many  companies  can  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  direct  the  use  of  environmentally
appropriate components and products wherever possible. Thus, for example, open relays might be deleted from
such  lists,  on  the  grounds  that  they “can’t  swim”,  and  thus  might  implicitly  establish  a  need  for  chlorinated
solvent, as opposed to aqueous, cleaning systems.
