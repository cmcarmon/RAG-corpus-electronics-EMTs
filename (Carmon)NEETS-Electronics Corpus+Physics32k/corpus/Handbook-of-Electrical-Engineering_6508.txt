Relative Intensity Noise
Relative intensity noise (RIN) can originate from the laser or from
 in the ﬁber. In the laser, RIN is
reﬂections and 
caused  by  spontaneous  emission  in  the  active  layer.  Spontaneous
emission  drives  random  ﬂuctuations  in  the  number  of  photons  in
the laser which appear as a random modulation of the output inten-
sity, with frequency components extending to tens of gigahertz. The
RIN,  where  RIN  is
noise  power  spectral  density  from  RIN  is 
expressed in decibels per hertz.
