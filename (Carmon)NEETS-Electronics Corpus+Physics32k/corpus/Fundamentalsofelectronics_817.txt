This way of representing a bit stream—changing the bit changes the sign of the transmitted signal—is
known as binary phase shift keying and abbreviated BPSK. The name comes from concisely expressing
this popular way of communicating digital information. The word “binary” is clear enough (one binary-valued
quantity is transmitted during a bit interval). Changing the sign of sinusoid amounts to changing—shifting—
the phase by π (although we don’t have a sinusoid yet). The word “keying” reﬂects back to the ﬁrst electrical
communication system, which happened to be digital as well: the telegraph.
