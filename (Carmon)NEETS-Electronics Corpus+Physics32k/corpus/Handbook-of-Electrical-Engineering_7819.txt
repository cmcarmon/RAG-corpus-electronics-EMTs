(a)  Multi-element  lens  design  for  a
high  numerical  aperture  video  disk  objective.  (Source:

March 1984. With permission.) (b) Various parameters
of  the  objective  lens.  The  numerical  aperture  is  NA  =
sin q. The spot diameter d and the depth of focus d  are
given  by  Eqs.  (80.10)  and  (80.11),  respectively.
(c) Focusing through the substrate can cause spherical
aberration at the active layer. The problem can be cor-
rected if the substrate is taken into account while design-
ing the objective.
