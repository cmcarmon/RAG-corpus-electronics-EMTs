8.2.5 Given that an n-channel enhancement MOSFET
has VT = 1.5 V, K = 5 mA/V2, IDQ = 10
mA, VDSQ = 15 V, and a maximum continuous
power dissipation of 0.3 W. For the biasing circuit
of Figure 8.2.2 with VDD = 24 V, R2 = 1 M,
and the voltage across RS = 3 V, ﬁnd RS, RD, VG,
and R1. Also ﬁnd the continuous power dissipated
in the MOSFET.
