c i r c u i t Let us now conduct a numerical analysis of the operational amplifier of
Example 7.21. Following Example 7.20, let VS = 10 V, IS = 0.5 mA, Kn = 1 mA/V2,
VTn = 1 V, and R1 = 10 k. Further, let Kp = 1 mA/V2 and VTp = âˆ’1.5 V.
Then, from Equation 7.73, R2 must be 20 k in order for vOUT to be biased at 0 V
when vIN1 = vIN2. Given this design, Equation 7.72 yields
