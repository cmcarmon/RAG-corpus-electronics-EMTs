An electronic ﬂashgun has a current-limiting 
12 ⍀,
electrolytic capacitor charged to 240 V. If the lamp resistance is 
ﬁnd: (a) the peak charging current, (b) the time required for the capac-
itor to fully charge, (c) the peak discharging current, (d) the total energy
stored  in  the  capacitor,  and  (e)  the  average  power  dissipated  by  the
lamp.
