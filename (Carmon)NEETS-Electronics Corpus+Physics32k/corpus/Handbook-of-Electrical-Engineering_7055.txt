Arithmetic Coding
In the previous subsections, it was shown how we could construct a code for a source that achieves an average
length within one bit of the entropy. For small source alphabets, however, we have efÔ¨Åcient coding only if we
use long blocks of source symbols. For example, if the source is binary, and we code each symbol separately,
we must use 1 bit per symbol, irrespective of the entropy of the source. If we use long blocks, we can achieve
an expected length per symbol close to the entropy rate of the source.
