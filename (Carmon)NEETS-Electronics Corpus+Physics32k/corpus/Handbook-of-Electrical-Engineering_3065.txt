Transformation from Low-Pass to Other Filter Types
To  obtain  a  high-pass,  bandpass,  or  bandstop  ﬁlter  function  from  a  low-pass  prototype,  one  of  two  general
methods can be used. In one of these, the circuit is realized and then individual circuit elements are replaced
by  other  elements  or  subcircuits.  This  method  is  more  useful  in  passive  ﬁlter  designs  and  is  not  discussed
further  here.  In  the  other  approach,  the  transfer  function  of  the  low-pass  prototype  is  transformed  into  the
required form for the desired ﬁlter. Then a circuit is chosen to realize the new ﬁlter function. We give a brief
description  of  the  transformation  in  this  section,  then  give  examples  of  circuit  realizations  in  the  following
sections.
