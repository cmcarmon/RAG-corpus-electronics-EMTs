operation of each device. With the aid of a simple 
circuit  diagram,  describe  a  typical  application  for 
each type of semiconductor. 
 
Assignment 4  Basic logic functions 
Write  a  report  identifying  the  types  and  symbols 
(both  BS3939  and  MIL/ANSI)  used  for  all  basic 
logic  gates  (AND,  OR,  NOT,  NAND  and  NOR). 
Include in your report a description of the operation 
of each logic gate together with a truth table. 
 
Assignment 5  Applications of logic circuits 
 
With  the  aid  of  labelled  diagrams,  describe  TWO 
applications of logic gates. One application should 
be  based  on  combinational  logic  while  the  other 
should use sequential logic. 
 
Assignment 6  Electronic measuring instruments 
 
Write a report describing the operation and use of 
(a) a multimeter and (b) an oscilloscope. Illustrate 
your  report  with  records  of  measurements  carried 
out  on  three  common  electronic  components  and 
two simple electronic circuits. 
 
Assignment 7  Microprocessors 
 
Investigate TWO common types of microprocessor. 
Produce  an  A4-size  data  sheet  for  each  device
