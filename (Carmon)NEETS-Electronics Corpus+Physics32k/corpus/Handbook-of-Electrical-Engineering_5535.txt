The mechanism by which SVCs introduce damping into the system can be explained as a result of the change
in  system  voltage  due  to  switching  of  a  capacitor/reactor.  The  electrical  power  output  of  the  generators  is
changed immediately due to the change in power transfer capability and the change in load power requirements.
Among the early applications of SVC for power system damping is the application to the Scandinavian system
as discussed in Olwegard et al. [1981]. More recently, SVC control for damping of system oscillations based on
local measurements has been proposed. The scheme uses phase-angle estimates based on voltage and power
measurements at the SVC location as the control signal [see Lerch et al., 1991].
