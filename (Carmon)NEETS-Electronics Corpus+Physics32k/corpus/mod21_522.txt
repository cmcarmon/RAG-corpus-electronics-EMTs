SWEPT-FREQUENCY testing is used to determine the bandwidth, alignment, frequency response, 
impedance matching, and attenuation in various circuits, systems, and components. Swept-frequency 
testing can be used to quickly determine the broadband response of a device that otherwise would require 
a number of separate measurements and manual plotting of the response curve. Swept-frequency
