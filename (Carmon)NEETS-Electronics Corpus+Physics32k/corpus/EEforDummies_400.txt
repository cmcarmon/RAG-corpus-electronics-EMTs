Because the AC source is constantly changing direction, the capacitor goes 
through a continuous cycle of charging, discharging, and recharging. As a 
result, electrical charges move back and forth through the circuit, and even 
though virtually no current flows across the dielectric (except a small leak-
age current), the effect is the same as if current were flowing through the 
capacitor. These amazing capacitors are said to pass alternating current (AC) 
even though they block direct current (DC).
