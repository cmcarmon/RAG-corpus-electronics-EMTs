In the list of the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th
century, the National Academy of Engineering ranked electri-
ﬁcation at the very top. The availability of electricity for indus-
trial, commercial, and domestic uses has affected human
society more profoundly than any other technology in the
history of mankind. From the modest start in 1882 of Edison’s
Pearl Street electric generating station in New York City that
could provide electric lights in a few buildings in lower Man-
hattan, to the highly interconnected power grids of today that
span continents to bring reliable and affordable electric power
to most of human habitation, the development of the technol-
ogy of electric power systems is a remarkable story of not only
engineering innovation but also of business practices, govern-
mental regulations, and societal changes.
