The ripple counter is also called an ASYNCHRONOUS counter. Asynchronous means that the
events (setting and resetting of FFs) occur one after the other rather than all at once. Because the ripple
count is asynchronous, it can produce erroneous indications when the clock speed is high. A high-speed
clock can cause the lower stage FFs to change state before the upper stages have reacted to the previous
clock pulse. The errors are produced by the FFsâ€™ inability to keep up with the clock.
