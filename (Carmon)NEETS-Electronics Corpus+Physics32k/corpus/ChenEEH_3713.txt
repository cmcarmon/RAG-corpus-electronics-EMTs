In principle, the mel cepstrum represents a set of features
that are more similar (than those derived uniformly over the
frequency spectrum) to those used by the human auditory
system in sound perception. A mel is a unit of measure of
perceived pitch or frequency of a tone. It does not correspond
linearly to the physical frequency of the tone because the
human auditory system does not perceive pitch in this linear
manner (Stevens and Volkman, 1940; Koenig, 1949). The
mapping between real frequencies, say FHz, and perceived
frequency, say Fmel, is approximately (Fant, 1959):
