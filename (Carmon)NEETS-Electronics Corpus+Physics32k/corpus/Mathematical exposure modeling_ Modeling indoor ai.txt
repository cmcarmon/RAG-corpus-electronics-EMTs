Mathematical modeling is commonly used to determine human exposure to indoor air pollution. Studies have shown that humans spend about 90% of their time indoors, and contaminant levels may be as high or higher inside than outside, due to the presence of multiple indoor contaminant sources, in combination with poor ventilation. Indoor air modeling requires information on a number of parameters including the air exchange rate, deposition rate, source emission rate, and physical volume of the indoor setting. Indoor environments can basically be thought of as closed systems, so models describing them are usually based on the "mass balance" equation. It is also assumed that a pollutant emitted into an indoor environment instantly spreads uniformly throughout the system, so that the concentration is the same at any point in space at any point in time. Mathematically, the total pollutant mass emitted inside a chamber during time T can be expressed as

Gsource(T) =

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{T}g(t)\,dt}


where
Gsource(T) = total mass contributed by the source over time T (e.g., mg)
g(t) = emission flow rate as a function of time t (e.g., mg/min)

The total mass lost during time T can be expressed as

Qlost(T) =

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{T}wx(t)\,dt}


where
Qlost(T) = total mass lost from the chamber over time T (e.g., mg)
x(t) = concentration of pollutant in the air exiting the chamber (e.g., mg/m3)
w = flow rate of air exiting the chamber (e.g., m3/min)

Following the principle of the "mass balance" equation, the total mass in the chamber at time T, is the difference between the two equations above, mass generated during time T minus mass lost during time T. This value may also be calculated from the equation

Total mass inside the chamber at time T = vx(T)
