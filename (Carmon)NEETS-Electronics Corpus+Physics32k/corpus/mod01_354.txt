A cell that is not being used (sitting on the shelf) will gradually deteriorate because of slow internal 
chemical changes (local action). This deterioration is usually very slow if cells are properly stored. If 
unused cells are stored in a cool place, their shelf life will be greatly preserved. Therefore, to minimize 
deterioration, they should be stored in refrigerated spaces.
