The sum and difference frequencies occur because the phase angles of the two fundamentals are 
constantly changing. If generator G1 produces a 10-hertz voltage and generator G2 produces an 11-hertz 
voltage, the waveforms produced because of the nonlinear impedance will be as shown in the following 
list:
