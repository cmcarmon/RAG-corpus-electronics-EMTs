The switch is on!
The circuit in Figure 10-11 is a touch 
switch. It uses a pair of NPN transistors 
to amplify a really teeny base current 
enough to light the LED. This piggyback 
configuration of two bipolar transistors, 
with their collectors connected and the 
emitter of one feeding into the base of 
the other, is known as a Darlington pair. 
(The letter Q is used to label transistors 
in schematics.)
