Improved ripple filters 
 
A further improvement can be achieved by using an 
inductor, L1, instead of a resistor in the smoothing 
circuit.  This  circuit  also  offers  the  advantage  that 
the  minimum  d.c.  voltage  is  dropped  across  the 
inductor  (in  the  circuit  of  Fig.  6.7,  the  d.c.  output 
voltage  is  reduced  by  an  amount  equal  to  the 
voltage drop across R1).
