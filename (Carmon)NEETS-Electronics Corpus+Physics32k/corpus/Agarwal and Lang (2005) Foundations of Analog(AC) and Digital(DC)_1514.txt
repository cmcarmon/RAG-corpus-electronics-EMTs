As suggested in Figure 10.57, a simple modification of our memory circuit
can make it restoring. This design adds a pair of series connected inverters (or
a buffer) to the output of our previous memory element circuit. The buffer will
restore a VIH voltage on the capacitor terminal to a VOH voltage at the dOUT
output. Interestingly, when a buffer is included in the memory element circuit,
we do not need to implement a special capacitor to hold charge. Rather, the
gate capacitance of the buffer CGS forms the memory capacitance CM.
