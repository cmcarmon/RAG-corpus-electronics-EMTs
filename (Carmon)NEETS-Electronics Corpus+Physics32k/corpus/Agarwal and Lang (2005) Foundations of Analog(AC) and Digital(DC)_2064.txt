Thus, this circuit is behaving like a low-pass filter as it passes low frequencies without
degradation, while it significantly attenuates high frequencies. However, since this circuit
has a very high Q, it probably will not serve as a useful low-pass filter, as it can produce
voltages that are significantly higher than the input when driven near its resonance
frequency. If a more or less flat response is desired at low frequencies (from DC to
approximately the resonance frequency) then the circuit designer must change the circuit
parameters to obtain a lower value of Q, for example, Q = 1.
One final point is worth noting: The circuit parameters shown in Figure 14.37 make
for a high-Q circuit, with Q â‰ˆ 25. In this case, the undamped resonance frequency, the
damped resonance frequency, and the frequency at which the circuit yields the maximum
amplitude of vC are all very nearly equal. Further, the amplitudes at all three frequencies
are all very nearly equal to Q times the input amplitude.
