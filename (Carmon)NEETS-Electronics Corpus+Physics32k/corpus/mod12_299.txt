Many different fm modulators are available, but they all use the basic principles you have just
studied. The main point to remember is that an oscillator must be used to establish the reference (carrier)
frequency. Secondly, some method is needed to cause the oscillator to change frequency in accordance
with an af signal. Anytime this can be accomplished, we have a frequency modulator.
