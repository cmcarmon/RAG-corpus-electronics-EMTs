full-scale value. Because electrodynamic wattmeter errors increase with frequency, they are used 
primarily for measuring 60-hertz line power. Unshielded electrodynamic wattmeters should not be placed 
in the vicinity of stray magnetic fields. A wattmeter has current, voltage, and power ratings; therefore, 
damage may result when any of these ratings is exceeded.
