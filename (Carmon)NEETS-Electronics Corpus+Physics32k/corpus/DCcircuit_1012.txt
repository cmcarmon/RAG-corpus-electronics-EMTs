In electric network analysis, the fundamental rules are Ohm’s Law and Kirchhoff’s Laws.
While these humble laws may be applied to analyze just about any circuit conﬁguration (even if
we have to resort to complex algebra to handle multiple unknowns), there are some “shortcut”
methods of analysis to make the math easier for the average human.
