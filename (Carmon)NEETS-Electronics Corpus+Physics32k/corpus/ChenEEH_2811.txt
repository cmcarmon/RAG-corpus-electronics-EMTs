To reduce this reﬂection error, Berenger (1994) proposed
that the PML losses gradually rise from zero along the direc-
tion normal to the interface. Assuming such a grading, the
PML remains matched. Pursuing this idea, we consider as an
example an x-directed plane wave impinging at angle u upon a
PEC-backed PML slab of thickness d, with the front planar
interface located in the x ¼ 0 plane. Assuming the graded PML
conductivity proﬁle sx(x), we can obtain:
