It  seems  clear  that  the  continuing  development  of  intracavitary  transducers,  particularly  for  intravascular
imaging, and the use of ultrasound intraoperatively will lead to more high-frequency commercially available
probes  that  will  produce  better  resolution  images  for  these  applications.  The  development  of  useful  three-
dimensional ultrasonic imaging is progressing rapidly and should immediately improve the measurement of
tissue volumes [Gilja et al., 1995].
