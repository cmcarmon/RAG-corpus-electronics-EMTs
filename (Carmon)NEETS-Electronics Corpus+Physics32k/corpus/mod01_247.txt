is German silver which is composed of copper, nickel, and zinc. The qualities and quantities of these
elements present in the wire determine the resistivity of the wire. (The resistivity of the wire is the
measure or ability of the wire to resist current. Usually the percent of nickel in the wire determines the
resistivity.) One disadvantage of the wirewound resistor is that it takes a large amount of wire to
manufacture a resistor of high ohmic value, thereby increasing the cost. A variation of the wirewound
resistor provides an exposed surface to the resistance wire on one side. An adjustable tap is attached to
this side. Such resistors, sometimes with two or more adjustable taps, are used as voltage dividers in
power supplies and other applications where a specific voltage is desired to be "tapped" off.
