1012, and ¯TR = 300 K, determine the system noise
temperature and Nao at the receiver output.
15.1.42 (a) An ampliﬁer with F0 = 3 or 4.77 dB, f 0 =
4 GHz, and BN = 14 MHz is used with an
antenna for which Ta= 200 K. The connecting
path loss is 1.45, or 1.61 dB at a physical tem-
perature of 250 K. Find the available system
noise power.
