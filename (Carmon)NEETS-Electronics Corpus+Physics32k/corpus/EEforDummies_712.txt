Some ICs are very sensitive to static electricity (which I discuss in 
Chapter 13), so when you store your ICs, be sure to enclose them in special 
conductive foam (sold by most electronics suppliers). And before handling 
an IC, make sure you wear an antistatic wrist strap or discharge yourself by 
touching a conductive material that is connected to earth ground (such as 
the grounded metal case of your home computer) so that you don’t zap your 
IC and wonder why it’s not working. (Don’t count on the metal pipes in your 
house to provide a conduit for static charge dissipation. Many home plumb-
ing systems use plastic pipes along the way, so the metal pipes you see in 
your house aren’t necessarily electrically connected to the earth.)
