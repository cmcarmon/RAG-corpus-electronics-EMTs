In fictional works, a force field, sometimes known as an energy shield, force shield, defence shield or deflector shield, is a barrier made of energy, plasma, or particles. It protects a person, area, or object from attacks or intrusions. This fictional technology is created as a field of energy without mass that acts as a wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. This concept has become a staple of many science-fiction works, so much so that authors frequently do not even bother to explain or justify them to their readers treating them almost as established fact and attributing whatever capabilities the plot requires.
There is ongoing scientific research into real force fields, primarily to protect against radiation.
