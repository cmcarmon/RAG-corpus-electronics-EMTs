ohms or very close to it.
If your meter doesn’t have an 
autozero feature, look for an adjust 
(or zero adjust) button to press. On 
analog meters, rotate the meter’s 
zero adjust knob until the needle 
reads 0 (zero). Keep the test probes 
in contact and wait a second or two 
for the meter to set itself to zero.
