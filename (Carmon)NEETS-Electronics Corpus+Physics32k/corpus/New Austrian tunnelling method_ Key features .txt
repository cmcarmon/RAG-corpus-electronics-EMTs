Key features of the NATM design philosophy are:
The strength of the ground around a tunnel is deliberately mobilized to the maximum extent possible.
Mobilization of ground strength is achieved by allowing controlled deformation of the ground.
Initial primary support is installed having load-deformation characteristics appropriate to the ground conditions, and installation is timed with respect to ground deformations.
Instrumentation is installed to monitor deformations in the initial support system, as well as to form the basis of varying the initial support design and the sequence of excavation.
When NATM is seen as a construction method, the key features are:
The tunnel is sequentially excavated and supported, and the excavation sequences can be varied to efficiently address the specific rock conditions being encountered.
The initial ground support is provided by shotcrete in combination with fiber or welded-wire fabric reinforcement, steel arches (usually lattice girders), and sometimes ground reinforcement (e.g. soil nails, spiling).
The permanent support is typically a cast-in-place concrete lining placed over a waterproofing membrane.
There is a quick closure of the invert, that is, the bottom part of the tunnel, to create a structural ring that takes advantage of the rock or soil arc naturally created on the top part of the tunnel section.
