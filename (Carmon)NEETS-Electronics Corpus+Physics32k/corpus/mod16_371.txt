Remember that the ohmmeter is an open circuit when the test leads are separated. To take a
resistance reading with a meter, you must provide a path for current flow produced by the meterâ€™s battery.
In view A of figure 3-13, the meter is connected at points A and B to produce this path. Connecting these
test leads places resistors R1 and R2 in series with the resistance of the meter coil, the zero-adjust
potentiometer, and the series multiplying resistor. Since you previously calibrated the meter, the amount
of coil movement now depends only on the resistances of R1 and R2.
