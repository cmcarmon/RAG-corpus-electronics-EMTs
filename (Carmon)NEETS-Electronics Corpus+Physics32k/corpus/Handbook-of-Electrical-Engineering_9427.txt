Another approach to fault tolerance is to employ redundancy of information. Information redundancy is simply
the addition of redundant information to data to allow fault detection, fault masking, or possibly fault tolerance.
Good  examples  of  information  redundancy  are  error  detecting  and  error  correcting  codes,  formed  by  the
addition of redundant information to data words or by the mapping of data words into new representations
containing redundant information [Lin and Costello, 1983].
