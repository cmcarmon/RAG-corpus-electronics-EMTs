As we saw in Section 9.1.1, from the perspective of modeling electrical systems,
the capacitor is a circuit element to model the effect of electric fields. Corre-
spondingly, the inductor models the effect of magnetic fields. To understand
the behavior of an inductor, and to illustrate the manner in which a lumped
model can be developed for it, consider the idealized two-terminal linear induc-
tor shown in Figure 9.13. In this inductor a coil with a terminal on each end
is wound with N turns around a toroidal core made from an insulator having
magnetic permeability Âµ. The length around the core is l and its cross-sectional
area is A. Note that these dimensions will be functions of time if the geometry
of the inductor varies.
