Bokelmann and Harjes reported the effects on the shear waves of fluid injection at about 9 kilometer depth in the German Continental Deep Drilling Program (KTB) deep drilling site in southeast Germany. They observed shear-wave splitting from injection-induced events at a pilot well offset 190 meters form the KTB well. A borehole recorder at a depth of 4,000 meters was used to record the splitting measurements.
They found:
Temporal variations in shear-wave splitting as a direct result of injection-induced events.
That the initial ~1% shear wave splitting decreases by 2.5% in the next 12 hours following the injection.
The largest decrease occurred within two hours after the injection.
The splitting time to be very stable after the injection ceased.
No direct interpretation of the decrease is proposed but it is suggested that the decrease is associated with stress release by the induced events.
