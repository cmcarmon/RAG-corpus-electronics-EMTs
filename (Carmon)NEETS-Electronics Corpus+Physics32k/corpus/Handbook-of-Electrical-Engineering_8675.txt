If each source line is taken in isolation, y appears constant, but y is dependent on the loop index i. Hence before
removing constant expressions, the compiler must map the dependencies of each variable on the other variables
and the loop index. Additionally, other not-so-obvious dependencies—such as when two pointers modify the
same structure—are difﬁcult to map and can result in erroneous object code. This is one of the difﬁculties in
optimizing compiler operation and why its extent is limited.
