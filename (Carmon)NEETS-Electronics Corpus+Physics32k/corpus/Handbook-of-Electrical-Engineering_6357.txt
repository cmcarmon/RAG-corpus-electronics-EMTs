The RF output signal of the channel encoder is ampliÔ¨Åed to the appropriate power level for transmission.
Because the carrier-to-noise (C/N) ratio of the modulated waveform is not generally so critical as that required
for analog communications systems, relatively low transmission power often can be used. Depending on the
sophistication of the data recovery circuits contained in the DAB receiver, the use of C/N ratios as low as 6 dB
are possible, without causing a degradation to the received signal.
