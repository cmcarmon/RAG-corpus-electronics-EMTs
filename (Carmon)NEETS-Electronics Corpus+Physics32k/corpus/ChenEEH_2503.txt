A stub is a typical one-port passive element in which one
of the two ports of a transmission line is terminated by
a certain reactive and/or resistive load denoted by ZL or
YL(YL ¼ 1=ZL), as shown in Figure 7.3(A). A stub is an attach-
ment to the main transmission line path, either at its end or
somewhere along the line in parallel or in series. The input
terminal of a stub (the part attached to the main transmission
line), depending on its load condition and length, can appear
as a capacitive or inductive impedance, as a series or parallel
resonance circuit, or as purely inductive or purely capacitive.
A transmission line stub is essentially an impedance trans-
former that must be mismatched at its end terminal to
become effective or operative. Because of a wide range of
input impedance possible, stubs are widely used as impedance
transformers and matching networks, as tuning elements or
dc-bias networks (a kind of low-pass ﬁlter), and as baluns or
ﬁlters. The most commonly used load conditions of a stub are
either a short load (ZL ¼ 0) or an open load (YL ¼ 0). Their
effect, however, is typically only narrow band. If broadband
stubs are needed, so-called radial microstrip open-ended
stubs (Figure 7.3), for example, are utilized. Other loads may
be in the form of a lumped capacitor or a lumped inductor
or a mixture of both. From transmission line theory (Collin,
1992), the input impedance Zi of a stub can simply be formu-
lated by:
