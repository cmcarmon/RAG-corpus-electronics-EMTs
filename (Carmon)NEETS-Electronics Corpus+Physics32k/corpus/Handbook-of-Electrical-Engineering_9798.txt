There is a trade-off between the complexity of the model form and the ﬁdelity with which it will match the
data set. For example, a pth-degree polynomial can exactly ﬁt to p + 1 data points, but a straight line might
be a better model of the underlying physics. Deviations from the line might be caused by extraneous measure-
ment noise. Issues such as these are addressed in Astrom [1980].
