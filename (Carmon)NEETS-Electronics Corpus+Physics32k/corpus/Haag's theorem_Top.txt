Rudolf Haag postulated that the interaction picture does not exist in an interacting, relativistic quantum field theory (QFT), something now commonly known as Haag's theorem. Haag's original proof was subsequently generalized by a number of authors, notably Hall and Wightman, who reached the conclusion that a single, universal Hilbert space representation does not suffice for describing both free and interacting fields. In 1975, Reed and Simon proved that a Haag-like theorem also applies to free neutral scalar fields of different masses, which implies that the interaction picture cannot exist even under the absence of interactions.
