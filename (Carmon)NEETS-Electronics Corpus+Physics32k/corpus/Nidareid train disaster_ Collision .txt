The driver on no. 361 was the first to realize that they were on a collision course as he saw the lights of Litra D emerging from the tunnel. The driver of Litra D realized the same only a few seconds before impact. Litra D was in a tunnel and the headlight on the incoming train no. 361 was not particularly bright. When the driver of Litra D noticed what was happening, he also pulled the brakes to slow his train down. At 23:57, the two trains collided just after Litra D had emerged from the tunnel.
The large and heavy engines were damaged, but mostly in one piece, engine 182 which had hauled train no. 361 was the most severely damaged of these which sustained a destroyed cylinder. Behind no. 182, the conductor's carriage had been seriously damaged and the train manager was wounded. The great losses took place in the extra train Litra D. The luggage car running behind the two engines was tossed aside, but the second and third cars, sleeping carriages, had been crushed as they bored into one another and tipped over. Crushing of these two cars had dissipated most of the energy, and behind this the wreckage of these two cars, the train was mostly unharmed.
The collision had happened next to Hammer's villa, which was used as a temporary hospital for the injured during the night. The king, who had remained in Trondheim also visited the site that night, and stayed there until half past four the following morning.
