 emit beams with divergence angle of about a milliradian, meaning that they
spread  to  about  1  m  in  diameter  after  traveling  a  kilometer.  (Semiconductor  lasers  have  much  larger  beam
divergence, but suitable optics can reshape the beam to make it much narrower.) The actual beam divergence
depends on the type of laser and the optics used with it. The fact that laser light is contained in a beam serves
to concentrate the output power onto a small area. Thus, a modest laser power can produce a high intensity
inside the small area of the laser beam; the intensity of light in a 1-mW helium-neon laser beam is comparable
to that of sunlight on a clear day, for example. The beams from high-power lasers, delivering tens of watts or
more  of  continuous  power  or  higher  peak  powers  in  pulses,  can  be  concentrated  to  high  enough  intensities
that they can weld, drill, or cut many materials.
