Displacement and Force
Many types of forces are sensed by the displacements they create. For example, the force due to acceleration
of a mass at the end of a spring will cause the spring to stretch and the mass to move. Its displacement from

the zero acceleration position is governed by the force generated by the acceleration (
force  of  the  spring. Another  example  is  the  displacement  of  the center  of  a  deformable  membrane  due  to  a
difference in pressure across it. Both of these examples use multiple transduction mechanisms to produce an
electronic output: a primary mechanism which converts force to displacement (mechanical to mechanical) and
then an intermediate mechanism to convert displacement to an electrical signal (mechanical to electrical).
