At temperatures above 130ยบ F, a tape's oxide coating tends to become soft. At temperatures below
2ยบ F, the oxide coating tends to be brittle. In both cases, the oxide coating will shed, flake off, or
otherwise become separated from the base material. These free pieces of oxide will then stick to parts of
the tape transport, to the magnetic heads, or back onto the tape and cause dropout or level errors.
