If the potentiometer mechanism remains in a single position (wiper is stationary), the
series-connected ammeter will register a constant (unchanging) current, and the voltmeter
connected across the inductor will register 0 volts. In this scenario, the instantaneous rate of
current change (di/dt) is equal to zero, because the current is stable. The equation tells us that
with 0 amps per second change for a di/dt, there must be zero instantaneous voltage (v) across
the inductor. From a physical perspective, with no current change, there will be a steady mag-
netic ﬁeld generated by the inductor. With no change in magnetic ﬂux (dΦ/dt = 0 Webers per
second), there will be no voltage dropped across the length of the coil due to induction.
