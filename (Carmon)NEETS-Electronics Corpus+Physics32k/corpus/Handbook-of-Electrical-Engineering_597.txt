In this particular example the input signal frequency is 1 MHz, and this is the frequency at which the Fourier
analysis is requested. Since there are no energy storage elements in the circuit another frequency would have
given identical results. To determine the Fourier components accurately a small value of the parameter RELTOL
is used and a sufﬁcient number of points for transient analysis are speciﬁed. From the output voltage waveforms
and the Fourier analysis it is seen that the harmonic distortion increases signiﬁcantly when the input voltage
amplitude is increased from 10 mV to 100 mV.
