Another amplifying detector that is used in portable receivers is the COMMON-BASE DETECTOR.
In this circuit detection occurs in the emitter-base junction and amplification occurs at the output of the
collector junction. The output developed is the equivalent of a diode detector which is followed by a stage
of audio amplification, but with more distortion. Figure 3-8 is a schematic of a typical common-base
detector. Transformer T1 is tuned by capacitor C3 to the frequency of the incoming modulated envelope.
Resistor R1 and capacitor C1 form a self-biasing network which sets the dc operating point of the emitter
junction. The af output is taken from the collector circuit through audio transformer T2. The primary of
T2 forms the detector output load and is bypassed for rf by capacitor C2.
