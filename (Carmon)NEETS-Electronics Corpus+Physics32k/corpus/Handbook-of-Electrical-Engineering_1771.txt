The quantizer is a mapping operation which generally takes the form of a staircase function (see Fig. 17.12).
A rule for quantization can be deÔ¨Åned as follows: Let {dk, k = 1, 2,. . .,  N + 1} be the set of decision levels with
d1 the minimum amplitude value and dN the maximum amplitude value of  f ( j,k,l). If  f ( j,k,l) is contained in
the interval (dk ,  dk+1), then it is mapped to the  kth reconstruction level  r. Methods for designing quantizers
can be broken into two categories: uniform and nonuniform. The input-output function for a typical uniform
quantizer is shown in Fig. 17.12. The mean square value of the quantizing noise can be easily calculated if it is
assumed that the amplitude probability distribution is constant within each quantization step. The quantization
step size for a uniform quantizer is
