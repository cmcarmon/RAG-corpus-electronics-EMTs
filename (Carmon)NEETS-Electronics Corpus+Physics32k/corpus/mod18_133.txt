Radar systems are normally divided into operational categories based on energy transmission
methods. Up to this point, we have mentioned only the pulse method of transmission to illustrate basic
radar concepts. Although the pulse method is the most common method of transmitting radar energy, two
other methods are sometimes used in special applications. These are the continuous-wave (cw) method
and the frequency modulation (fm) method. All three basic transmission methods are often further
subdivided to designate specific variations or combinations.
