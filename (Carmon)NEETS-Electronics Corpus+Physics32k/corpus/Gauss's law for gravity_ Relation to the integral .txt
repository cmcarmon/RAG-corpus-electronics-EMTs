The two forms of Gauss's law for gravity are mathematically equivalent. The divergence theorem states:

g


d
V


{\displaystyle \oint _{\partial V}\mathbf {g} \cdot d\mathbf {A} =\int _{V}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} \ dV}

where V is a closed region bounded by a simple closed oriented surface ∂V and dV is an infinitesimal piece of the volume V (see volume integral for more details). The gravitational field g must be a continuously differentiable vector field defined on a neighborhood of V.
Given also that




M

∫

d
V


{\displaystyle M=\int _{V}\rho \ dV}

we can apply the divergence theorem to the integral form of Gauss's law for gravity, which becomes:

{\displaystyle \int _{V}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} \ dV=-4\pi G\int _{V}\rho \ dV}

which can be rewritten:

{\displaystyle \int _{V}(\nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} )\ dV=\int _{V}(-4\pi G\rho )\ dV.}

This has to hold simultaneously for every possible volume V; the only way this can happen is if the integrands are equal. Hence we arrive at

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} =-4\pi G\rho ,}

which is the differential form of Gauss's law for gravity.
It is possible to derive the integral form from the differential form using the reverse of this method.
Although the two forms are equivalent, one or the other might be more convenient to use in a particular computation.
