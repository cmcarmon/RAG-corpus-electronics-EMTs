Problem 4.2: Fourier Series
Find the Fourier series representation for the periodic signals shown in Figure 4.19. For the third signal,
Ô¨Ånd the complex Fourier series for the triangle wave without performing the usual Fourier integrals. Hint:
How is this signal related to one for which you already have the series?
