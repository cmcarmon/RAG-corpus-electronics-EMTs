▶✓ The connection: The LEDs are switched when the 4017 receives a pulse 
(on pin 14) from the 555 output (pin 3). You wire the 4017 so it repeats 
the 1‐to‐10 sequence, over and over again, for as long as the circuit 
has power. By adjusting the pot (R1), you can change the speed of the 
 lighting sequence.
