Both electrical and water trees tend to propagate from electrical stress enhancement points, with water trees
requiring appreciably lower stresses for their inception (ca. 2 kV/mm). Whereas the electrical tree mechanism
usually involves partial discharges, the occurrence of the latter is conspicuously absent in water trees. The fact
that water trees may bridge the opposite electrodes without precipitating failure infers a nonconductive nature
of  the  Ô¨Ålamentary  channels  or  branches. Yet  water  trees  are  implicated  in  the  overall  degradation  and  aging
process of the dielectric because of their presence in areas of failure as well as because of the often-observed
phenomenon of an electrical tree emerging from some point along a water tree and causing abrupt failure.
