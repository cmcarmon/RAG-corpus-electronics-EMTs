The  generic  processes  in  a  typical  avionics  system  are  signal  detection  and  preprocessing,  signal  fusion,
computation,  control/display  information  generation  and  transmission,  and  feedback  of  the  response  to  the
control/display information. (Of course, not every system will perform all of these functions.)
