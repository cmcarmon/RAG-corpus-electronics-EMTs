The actual mechanical advantage (AMA) is the mechanical advantage determined by physical measurement of the input and output forces. Actual mechanical advantage takes into account energy loss due to deflection, friction, and wear.
The AMA of a machine is calculated as the ratio of the measured force output to the measured force input,

where the input and output forces are determined experimentally.
The ratio of the experimentally determined mechanical advantage to the ideal mechanical advantage is the efficiency η of the machine,
