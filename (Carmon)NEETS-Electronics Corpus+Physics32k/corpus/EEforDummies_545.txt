You refer to the P‐side of the pn‐junction in a diode as the anode and the 
N‐side as the cathode. For most diodes, if you apply a more positive voltage 
to the anode and a more negative voltage to the cathode, current will flow 
from the anode to the cathode. If you reverse the voltage, the diode will not 
conduct current. (Zener diodes are an exception; for details, flip ahead in this 
chapter to “Regulating voltage with Zener diodes.”)
