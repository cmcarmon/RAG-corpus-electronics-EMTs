1.1.16 A charge of 0.1 C passes through an electric source
of 6 V from its negative to its positive terminals.
Find the change in energy received by the charge.
Comment on whether the charge has gained or lost
energy, and also on the sign to be assigned to the
change of energy.
1.1.17 The voltage at terminal a relative to terminal b of
an electric component is v(t ) = 20 cos 120π t
V. A current i(t ) = −4 sin 120π t A ﬂows into
terminal a. From time t1 to t2, determine the total
energy ﬂowing into the component. In particular,
ﬁnd the energy absorbed when t2 = t1 + 1/15.
