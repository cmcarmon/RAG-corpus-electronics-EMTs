of  spread  spectrum  waveforms,  the  despreading  process  at  each  spread  spectrum  receiver  will  attenuate  the
components  of  the  Ô¨Ånal  test  statistic  due  to  the  overlaid  narrowband  signals.  Similarly,  because  of  the  LPI
characteristics  of  spread  spectrum  waveforms,  the  increase  in  the  overall  noise  level  as  seen  by  any  of  the
conventional signals, due to the overlay, can be kept relatively small.
