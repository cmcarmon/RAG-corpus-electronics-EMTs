with, the principles of Bayesian and Fisher statistics relevant
to estimation are presented. In the discussion of Bayesian
statistics, emphasis is placed on two types of estimators: the
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator and the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. An important class
of linear estimators, namely the Wiener ﬁlter, is also presented
as a linear MMSE estimator. In the discussion of Fisher statis-
tics, emphasis will be placed on the maximum likelihood
estimator (MLE), the concept of sufﬁcient statistics, and infor-
mation inequality that can be used to measure the quality of an
estimator.
