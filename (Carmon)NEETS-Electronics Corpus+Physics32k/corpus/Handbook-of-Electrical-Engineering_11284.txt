The heart is an amazing machine. Throughout an average lifetime, it contracts over 2.5 billion times to pump
blood  throughout  the  body.  Without  its  proper  function,  an  individual  will  die  within  minutes.  The  heart
consists of four chambers. The upper two chambers, the atria, are used as primers for the lower two chambers,
the ventricles, which serve as the main pump. Blood delivery will be inefﬁcient if the atria and ventricles do
not pump in mechanical synchrony (AV synchrony). Optimum efﬁciency occurs when the atria contract slightly
before the ventricles. Electrical depolarization waves are responsible for controlling the contractions of the heart
and thus maintaining AV synchrony. The depolarization waves originate from a specialized set of cells, known
as the sinus node, that are modulated by neural input and are located in the top of the right atrium. The sinus
