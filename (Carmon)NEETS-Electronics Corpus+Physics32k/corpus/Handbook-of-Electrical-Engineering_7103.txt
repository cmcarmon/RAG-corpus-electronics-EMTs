Initially, satellites were used primarily for point-to-point trafﬁc in the GEO ﬁxed satellite service (FSS), e.g.,
 stations. Large
for telephony across the oceans and for point-to-multipoint TV distribution to cable 
earth station antennas with high-gain narrow beams and high uplink powers were needed to compensate for
limited  satellite  power.  This  type  of  system,  exempliﬁed  by  the  early  global  network  of  the  International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT) used Standard-A earth antennas with 30-m diameters.
Since  then,  many  other  satellite  organizations  have  been  formed  around  the  world  to  provide  international,
regional, and domestic services.
