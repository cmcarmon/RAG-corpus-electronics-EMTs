A relay is an electromechanical switch that opens 
and closes with an electromagnetic coil (Figure 18-16).  
As a current flows through the coil, it generates a 
 magnetic field that attracts the plunger, pulling it 
down. As the plunger is pulled down, it closes the 
switch contacts. When the current through the coil 
stops, a spring pulls the armature back to its original 
position and opens the switch.
