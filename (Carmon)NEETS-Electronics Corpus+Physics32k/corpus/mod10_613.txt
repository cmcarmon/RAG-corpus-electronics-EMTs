Ground-wave transmission is widely used at medium and low frequencies. Horizontal polarization 
cannot be used at these frequencies because the electric lines of force are parallel to and touch the earth. 
Since the earth acts as a fairly good conductor at low frequencies, it would short out the horizontal 
electric lines of force and prevent the radio wave from traveling very far. Vertical electric lines of force, 
on the other hand, are bothered very little by the earth. Therefore vertical polarization is used for 
ground-wave transmission, allowing the radio wave to travel a considerable distance along the ground 
surface with minimum attenuation.
