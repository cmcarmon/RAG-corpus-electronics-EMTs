Irregular satellites have been captured from heliocentric orbits. (Indeed, it appears that the irregular moons of the giant planets, the Jovian and Neptunian trojans, and grey Kuiper belt objects have a similar origin.) For this to occur, at least one of three things needs to have happened:
energy dissipation (e.g. in interaction with the primordial gas cloud)
a substantial (40%) extension of the planet's Hill sphere in a brief period of time (thousands of years)
a transfer of energy in a three-body interaction. This could involve:
a collision (or close encounter) of an incoming body and a satellite, resulting in the incoming body losing energy and being captured.
a close encounter between an incoming binary object and the planet (or possibly an existing moon), resulting in one component of the binary being captured. Such a route has been suggested as most likely for Triton.

After the capture, some of the satellites could break up leading to groupings of smaller moons following similar orbits. Resonances could further modify the orbits making these groupings less recognizable.
