The equalized signal is the sum of the outputs of the forward and feedback parts of the equalizer. The forward
part is like the linear transversal equalizer discussed earlier. Decisions made on the equalized signal are fed back
via a second transversal Ô¨Ålter. The basic idea is that if the values of the symbols already detected are known
(past decisions are assumed to be correct), then the ISI contributed by these symbols can be canceled exactly,
by subtracting past symbol values with appropriate weighting from the equalizer output.
