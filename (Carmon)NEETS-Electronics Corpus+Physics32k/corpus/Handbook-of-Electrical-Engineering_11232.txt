In theory, both methods will lead to the same cross-bispectrum when data length is inﬁnite. However, with
ﬁnite  data  records,  direct  and  indirect  methods  generally  lead  to  cross-bispectrum  estimates  with  different
shapes (Fig. 115.4). Therefore, like power spectrum estimation, users have to choose an appropriate method
to extract the information desired.
