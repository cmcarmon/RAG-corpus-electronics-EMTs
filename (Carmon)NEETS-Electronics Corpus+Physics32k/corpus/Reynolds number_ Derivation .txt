{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathrm {Re} &={\frac {\text{inertial forces}}{\text{viscous forces}}}={\frac {{\text{mass}}\cdot {\text{acceleration}}}{{\text{dynamic viscosity}}\cdot {\frac {\text{velocity}}{\text{distance}}}\cdot {\text{area}}}}\\[5pt]&={\frac {\rho L^{3}\cdot {\frac {s}{t}}}{\mu \left({\frac {s}{L}}\right)L^{2}}}={\frac {(\rho L^{3})\left({\frac {1}{t}}\right)}{\mu \left({\frac {1}{L}}\right)L^{2}}}={\frac {(\rho L^{2})\left({\frac {1}{t}}\right)}{\mu }}={\frac {(\rho )\left({\frac {L}{t}}\right)(L)}{\mu }}={\frac {\rho sL}{\mu }}={\frac {sL}{\nu }}\end{aligned}}}

where:
s is the maximum speed of the object relative to the fluid (SI units: m/s)
L is a characteristic linear dimension, (travelled length of the fluid; hydraulic diameter when dealing with river systems) (m)
t denotes the time
μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa·s or N·s/m2 or kg/m·s)
ν (nu) is the kinematic viscosity (ν = μ/ρ) (m2/s)
ρ is the density of the fluid (kg/m3).
Note that multiplying the Reynolds number by Ls/Ls yields ρs2L2/μsL, which is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces. It could also be considered the ratio of the total momentum transfer to the molecular momentum transfer.
