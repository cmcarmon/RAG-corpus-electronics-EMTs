For a completely isolated system, S is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium.
For a system with controlled constant temperature and volume, A is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.
For a system with controlled constant temperature and pressure, G is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.
The various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows:
Two systems are in thermal equilibrium when their temperatures are the same.
Two systems are in mechanical equilibrium when their pressures are the same.
Two systems are in diffusive equilibrium when their chemical potentials are the same.
All forces are balanced and there is no significant external driving force.
