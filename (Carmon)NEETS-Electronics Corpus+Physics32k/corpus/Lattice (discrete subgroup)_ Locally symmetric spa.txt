A natural inner product on





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
is given by the Killing form. If



G


{\displaystyle G}
is not compact it is not definite and hence not an inner product: however when



G


{\displaystyle G}
is semisimple and



K


{\displaystyle K}
is a maximal compact subgroup it can be used to define a



G


{\displaystyle G}
-invariant metric on the homogeneous space



X
=
G

/

K


{\displaystyle X=G/K}
: such Riemannian manifolds are called symmetric spaces of non-compact type without Euclidean factors.
A subgroup



Γ
⊂
G


{\displaystyle \Gamma \subset G}
acts freely, properly discontinuously on



X


{\displaystyle X}
if and only if it is discrete and torsion-free. The quotients



Γ
∖
X


{\displaystyle \Gamma \backslash X}
are called locally symmetric spaces. There is thus a bijective correspondence between complete locally symmetric spaces locally isomorphic to



X


{\displaystyle X}
and of finite Riemannian volume, and torsion-free lattices in



G


{\displaystyle G}
. This correspondence can be extended to all lattices by adding orbifolds on the geometric side.
