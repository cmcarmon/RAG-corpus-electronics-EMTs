Graphical Method of Sketching Array Factor
Notice that the array factor in equation 6.199 is represented as
a function of c ¼ a þ k0d sin u sin f. This should be fairly easy
to sketch on the c plane. Ultimately one needs to sketch the
array factor as a function of the space angles (u, f). This
mapping may be done in a graphical manner, as demonstrated
in Figure 6.21 for a four-element array. In Figure 6.21, the
mapping from the c (upper sketch) to the u plane (lower polar
sketch) is demonstrated for the speciﬁc case of f ¼ p=2 and
a ¼ p=2 when d ¼ 0=2. The reasoning for the method, as
illustrated in this ﬁgure, should be self-explanatory and ac-
cordingly extended for other values of f and a.
Notice that the array factor will be maximum (¼ NI) when
c is zero or even multiples of p. This will determine the angle
of the maximum radiation umax for a given value of f, or vice
versa:
