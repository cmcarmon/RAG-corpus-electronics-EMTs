polarity is important with analog meters. The 
negative terminal of the voltmeter must be connected 
to the more negative point in the circuit, and the posi-
tive terminal to the more positive point in the circuit 
 (Figure 15-13). If the connections are reversed, the 
pointer deflects toward the left side of the meter, regis-
tering no measurement. If this occurs, reverse the me-
ter leads.
