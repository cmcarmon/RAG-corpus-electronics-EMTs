Antennas  have  been  widely  used  in  communication  systems  since  the  early  1900s.  Over  this  span  of  time
scientists and engineers have developed a vast number of different antennas. The radiative properties of each
of these antennas are described by an antenna pattern. This is a plot, as a function of direction, of the power
