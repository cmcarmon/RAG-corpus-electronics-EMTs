The sensitivity of a receiver is maximum when no signal is being received. This condition occurs, for
example, when a receiver is being tuned between stations. At this time background noise is picked up by
the antenna, and you will hear noise greatly amplified. This noise is highly annoying and occurs because
receiver gain is maximum without a signal. You can often overcome this problem by using a circuit called
a SQUELCH, NOISE SILENCER, NOISE SUPPRESSOR, or NOISE LIMITER. All of these noise type
circuits just clip the peaks of the noise spikes. Squelch will actually eliminate noise. Figure 2-21 is a
