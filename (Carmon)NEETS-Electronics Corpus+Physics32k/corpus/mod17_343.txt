The FIVE-UNIT (five-level) CODE has been the most commonly used in modern printing 
telegraphy and is universally used in teletypewriter operation. This is also known as the Baudot code. The 
mechanical sending device in the teletypewriter divides the sending time for each character into five short 
code elements (impulses) of equal duration. The five-unit code is an example of what is called an even 
length or constant length code (one in which the number of signal elements for a character is the same for 
every character and the duration of each element is constant). In the five-unit code, each character 
consists of a combination of five signal elements; each element may be either a mark or a space. A total 
of thirty-two combinations of signal elements are possible with this arrangement.
