The concept of signal restoration has been applied with success to a number of fundamental problems found
in  interdisciplinary  applications.  In  the  typical  signal  restoration  problem,  there  is  given  empirical  data  as
symbolically designated by x that corresponds to corrupted measurements made on an underlying signal being
monitored. By using attributes (properties) known to be or hypothesized as being possessed by the monitored
signal, it is possible to devise signal restoration algorithms that effectively remove the corruption to give useful
approximations of the underlying signal being monitored. Many of the more widely used restoration algorithms
take the form of a sequence of successive projections as speciÔ¨Åed by
