It is not always possible to tell if a fuse is open by visual inspection. Fuses with low current ratings
have elements that are so small, it is sometimes not possible to know if the fuse link is complete simply
by looking at it. If the fuse is not glass-bodied, it will not be possible to check the fuse visually. Also,
sometimes a fuse will look good, but will, in fact, be open. Therefore, while it is sometimes possible to
know if a fuse is open by visual inspection, it is not possible to be sure a fuse is good just by looking at it.
