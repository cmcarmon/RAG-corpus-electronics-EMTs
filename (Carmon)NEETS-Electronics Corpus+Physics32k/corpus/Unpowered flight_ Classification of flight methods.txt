Pennycuick divides animal flight into three types: parachuting, gliding and powered. He observes however that these have no sharp boundaries. For example at one point he sees parachutes as unpowered and as a primitive form of soaring, while soaring itself he sees as being powered by air movement (wind). Other methods, such as lighter-than-air flight, are used only by man.
This article makes the following distinctions between types or methods of unpowered flight, based on their characteristics:
Lighter than air - Sustained flight, buoyed by a density less than air with no forward motion required,
Falling - Sustained free flight due to slow rate of descent compared to upward air-speed,
Parachuting - Vertical descent slowed by high air resistance, though possibly with a minor horizontal motion (or sometimes defined as flight at an glide angle greater than 45 deg.),
Gliding - Forward flight with smooth airflow (or sometimes defined as flight with a glide angle less than 45 deg),
Soaring - Sustained free gliding flight, drawing energy from rising air,
Kiting - Tethered flight using an angled plane to create an upward force from the wind.
These are summarised in the table:
