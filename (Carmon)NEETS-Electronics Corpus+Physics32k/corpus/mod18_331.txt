The signals received during the resting time travel down the guide to the magnetron and the shorting
end plate where they are reflected. The slot coupling the waveguide to the cavity is located at a point
where the standing-wave magnetic field produced by reflections in the waveguide is maximum. The
maximum magnetic field, therefore, energizes the cavity. The echo signals are not strong enough to cause
an arc, and the cavity field is undisturbed by the gap. Therefore, the cavity field couples rf energy into the
receiver coaxial line and provides maximum energy transfer.
