Present mercury cells are manufactured in three basic types as shown in figure 2-5. The wound-
anode type, shown in figure 2-5 view A, has an anode composed of a corrugated zinc strip with a paper 
absorbent. The zinc is mixed with mercury, and the paper is soaked in the electrolyte which causes it to 
swell and press against the zinc and make positive contact. This process ensures that the electrolyte makes 
contact with the anode.
