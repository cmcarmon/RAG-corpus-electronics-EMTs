A(ddress) register operations are 32 bits wide. Address generation uses A 
registers as bases. D (data) registers allow byte, word, and longword operations. 
A7 is SP.
AP,FP,SP and PC hold the addresses of the argument block, the frame, the stack 
and the current place in the program, respectively. All data instructions can 
use any register.
The 4 groups of eight registers comprise: global (g), incoming parameters (i), 
local (l) and outgoing parameters (o). g0 is a hardwired 0 as a data source and 
a wastebasket as a destination. The registers are arranged as a window blind 
(see text) with the gâ€™s always visible and the others moveable in multiple 
overlapping frames of 24.
