The exact nature of light is not fully understood, although people have been studying the subject for
many centuries. In the 1700s and before, experiments seemed to indicate that light was composed of
particles. In the early 1800s, a physicist Thomas Young showed that light exhibited wave characteristics.
Further experiments by other physicists culminated in James Clerk (pronounced Clark) Maxwell
collecting the four fundamental equations that completely describe the behavior of the electromagnetic
fields. James Maxwell deduced that light was simply a component of the electromagnetic spectrum. This
seems to firmly establish that light is a wave. Yet, in the early 1900s, the interaction of light with
