Several commercial communication satellites plan to offer digital-ranging services worldwide. The intermit-
tent  nature  of  commercial  ﬁxes  would  require  that  vehicles  dead-reckon  between  ﬁxes,  perhaps  using  solid-
state inertial instruments. Thus, if taxpayers insist on collecting fees for service, private comm-nav networks
may replace the government-funded GPS and air-trafﬁc communication network in the next century. World-
wide trafﬁc control over oceans and undeveloped land areas would become possible.
