The frequency of faults is lower on underground systems
than on overhead systems. Faults, however, are much more
difﬁcult and time-consuming to ﬁnd, isolate, and repair on
underground systems. Service-restoration requirements dictate
that primary-system designs should operate as a normally
open loop. In the event of a cable fault, such design facilitates
location and isolation of the failure and faster service resto-
ration to all consumers on the unfaulted segment of the pri-
mary loop. A well-designed URD system should permit ease of
sectionalizing to isolate a faulted portion; it should be ﬂexible
to accept load growth with a minimum number of changes.
The looped primary and single-phase banked secondary sys-
tem provide these requirements at about the lowest cost. The
banked secondary system takes better advantage of diversity
among loads and permits a smaller installed kilovoltampere of
transformer capacity and possibly fewer transformers. Com-
pared to the simple radial system, the secondary system also
provides better voltage conditions at the loads and less volt-
age dip due to motor starting for a given transformer rating,
conductor size, and spacing among transformers.
