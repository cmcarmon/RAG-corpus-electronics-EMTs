In plasma physics three pinch geometries are commonly studied: the θ-pinch, the Z-pinch, and the Screw Pinch. These are cylindrically shaped. The cylinder is symmetric in the axial (z) direction and the azimuthal (θ) directions. The one-dimensional pinches are named for the direction the current travels.
