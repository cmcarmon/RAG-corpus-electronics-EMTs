If the function to be revolved is a function of y, the following integral will obtain the volume of the solid of revolution:




π

∫

c


d


R
(
y

)

2



d
y


{\displaystyle \pi \int _{c}^{d}R(y)^{2}\,dy}

where R(y) is the distance between the function and the axis of rotation. This works only if the axis of rotation is vertical (example: x = 4 or some other constant).
