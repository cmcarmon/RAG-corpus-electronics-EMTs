Reliability of Protection
In the ﬁeld of relaying, reliability implies certain very speciﬁc concepts [Mason, 1956]. A reliable protection
system  has  two  attributes:  dependability  and  security.  A  dependable  relay  is  one  that  always  operates  for
conditions  for  which  it  is  designed  to  operate. A  secure  relay  is  one  that  will  not  operate  for  conditions  for
which it is not intended to operate. In modern power systems, the failure to operate when a fault occurs—lack
of dependability—has very serious consequences for the power system. Therefore, most protective systems are
made secure by duplicating relaying equipment, duplicating relaying functions, and providing several levels of
backup  protection.  Thus  modern  systems  tend  to  be  very  dependable,  i.e.,  every  fault  is  cleared,  perhaps  by
more  than  one  relay.  As  a  consequence,  security  is  somewhat  degraded:  modern  protection  systems  will,
occasionally, act and trip equipment falsely. Such occurrences are rare, but not uncommon. As power systems
become leaner, i.e., they have insufﬁcient margins of reserve generation and transmission, lack of security can
be quite damaging. This has led to recent reevaluation of the proper balance between security and dependability
of the protection systems.
