Both electrostatic mapping and molecular orbital explanation for chalcogen bonding result in a predicted directionality for the bonding interaction. In a hydrogen or halogen bond, the electrophilic region/σ* orbital are located opposite the σ bond, forming a single σ-hole. Optimal hydrogen or halogen bonds thus are linear in geometry. Chalcogen bonding is a result of the same interaction. However, it is possible for chalcogens to for multiple sigma bonds and thus multiple σ-holes to form such bonding interactions. Evaluations of x-ray crystal structures or structure determinations based on vibrational spectroscopy can provide evidence for chalcogen bonding based on proximity and orientation of atoms. Surveys of the Cambridge Structural Database have revealed a high frequency of likely chalcogen bonding interactions in protein structures and solid state crystals of molecules.
