problem. This results both in reduced memory size
and a reduction in the associated power consumption.
Note that in Section 2.4, the data reuse step introduces
additional buffers to exploit the reuse of data in a
signal, whereas in-place mapping step exploits the
reuse in as well as between signals to reduce the size
of the existing signal.
