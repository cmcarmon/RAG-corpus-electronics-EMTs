Ferrule connectors use two cylindrical plugs (referred to as ferrules), an alignment sleeve, and
sometimes axial springs to perform fiber alignment. Figure 4-16 provides an illustration of this basic
ferrule connector design. Precision holes drilled or molded through the center of each ferrule allow for
fiber insertion and alignment. Precise fiber alignment depends on the accuracy of the central hole of each
ferrule. When the fiber ends are inserted, an adhesive (normally an epoxy resin) bonds the fiber inside the
ferrule. The fiber-end faces are polished until they are flush with the end of the ferrule to achieve a low-
loss fiber connection. Fiber alignment occurs when the ferrules are inserted into the alignment sleeve. The
inside diameter of the alignment sleeve aligns the ferrules, which in turn align the fibers. Ferrule
connectors lock the ferrules in the alignment sleeve using a threaded outer shell or some other type of
coupling mechanism.
