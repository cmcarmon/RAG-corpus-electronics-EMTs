Hand analysis of
large circuits, especially if they contain
nonlinear elements, can be tedious and prone to error. In
such cases, computer-aided design (CAD) is necessary to
speed up the analysis procedure and to obtain accurate
results. This chapter describes
the algorithms used in
CAD programs. Such programs are available from com-
mercial companies, such as Mentor Graphics, Cadence, and
Avant !
