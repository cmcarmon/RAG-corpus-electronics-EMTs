Rather than having six leads coming out of the three-phase alternator, the same leads from each
phase may be connected together to form a wye (Y) connection, as shown in figure 3-8, view B. It is
called a wye connection because, without the neutral, the windings appear as the letter Y, in this case
sideways or upside down.
