Charged Particle Detectors
Energetic heavy-charged particles lose kinetic energy continuously along a linear path in an absorbing material.
Energy is transferred primarily to the electrons in the absorbing material, but to a lesser extent to the nuclei
also  via  Rutherford  scattering.  Although  only  energy  transferred  directly  to  the  electronic  system  generates
electron-hole pairs, Eq. (116.5) (with ε = 3.62/pair for silicon at 300K) is still a good approximation. Energy
loss is characterized by two parameters: speciﬁc ionization loss dE/dx, which depends on the incident particle,
its  energy,  and  the  absorbing  material,  and  the  range  R  (i.e.,  the  penetration  depth  of  the  particle),  which
