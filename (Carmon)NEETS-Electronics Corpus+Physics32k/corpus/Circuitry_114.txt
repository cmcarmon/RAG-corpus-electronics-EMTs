Since the capacitors are of equal value, the applied 
d.c. potential will be shared equally between them. 
Thus each capacitor should be rated at 50 V. Note 
that,  in  a  practical  circuit,  we  could  take  steps  to 
ensure  that  the  d.c.  voltage  was  shared  equally 
between the two capacitors by  wiring equal, high-
value (e.g. 100 k$) resistors across each capacitor.
