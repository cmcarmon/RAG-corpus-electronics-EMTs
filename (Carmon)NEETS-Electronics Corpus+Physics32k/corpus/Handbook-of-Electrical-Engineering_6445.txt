FH systems are traditionally classiﬁed in accordance with the relationship between Th and Ts. Fast frequency-
hopped (FFH) systems are ones in which there exists one or more hops per data symbol, that is, Ts = NTh (N
an integer) whereas slow frequency-hopped (SFH) systems are ones in which there exists more than one symbol
per hop, that is, Th = NTs. It is customary in SS parlance to refer to the FH/MFSK tone of shortest duration as
a “chip”, despite the same usage for the PN chips associated with the code generator that drives the frequency
synthesizer.  Keeping  this  distinction  in  mind,  in  an  FFH  system  where,  as  already  stated,  there  are  multiple
hops per data symbol, a chip is equal to a hop. For SFH, where there are multiple data symbols per hop, a chip
is equal to an MFSK symbol. Combining these two statements, the chip rate Rc in an FH system is given by
the larger of Rh = 1/Th and Rs = 1/Ts and, as such, is the highest system clock rate.
