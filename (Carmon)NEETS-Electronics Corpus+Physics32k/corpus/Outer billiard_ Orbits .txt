An outer billiards orbit is the set of all iterations of the point, namely ... x0 <--> x1 <--> x2 <--> x3 ... That is, start at x0 and iteratively apply both the outer billiards map and the backwards outer billiards map. When P is a strictly convex shape, such as an ellipse, every point in the exterior of P has a well defined orbit. When P is a polygon, some points might not have well-defined orbits, on account of the potential ambiguity of choosing the midpoint of the relevant tangent line. Nevertheless, in the polygonal case, almost every point has a well-defined orbit.
An orbit is called periodic if it eventually repeats.
An orbit is called aperiodic (or non-periodic) if it is not periodic.
An orbit is called bounded (or stable) if some bounded region in the plane contains the whole orbit.
An orbit is called unbounded (or unstable) if it is not bounded.
