In fluid dynamics, Beltrami flows are flows in which the vorticity vector




Ï‰



{\displaystyle \mathbf {\omega } }
and the velocity vector




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
are parallel to each other. It is named after the Italian mathematician Eugenio Beltrami due to his derivation of the Beltrami vector field, while initial developments in fluid dynamics were done by the Russian scientist Ippolit S. Gromeka in 1881.
