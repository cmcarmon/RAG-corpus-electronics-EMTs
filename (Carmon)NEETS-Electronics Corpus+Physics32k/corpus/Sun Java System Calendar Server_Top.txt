The Sun Java System Calendar Server was Sun's calendar (scheduling) server. The currently available version is 6.3 which is now part of the Sun Java System Communications Suite.
Users can access their calendar and task list items using a variety of clients. Web browsers will be able to access Calendar data using Sun Java System Communications Express as an HTML-based client. Microsoft Outlook users can access their calendar data using the Sun Java System Connector for Microsoft Outlook, which is not yet compatible with Outlook 2010. Mozilla Thunderbird users can add fully functional calendar access to the Sun Calendar Server to the email software by adding the Mozilla Lightning extension for WCAP (Web Calendar Access Protocol). Finally, starting in 2008, the Sun Java System Communications Suite 6 will include an AJAX-based Web client which will provide better "thick client-like" user interactions.
A useful feature of Calendar Server is the notification service. This service will send an e-mail or an SMS to the calendar owner. These messages are sent to the calendar owner if he/she has been invited to an appointment or as a reminder of an upcoming appointment. These reminders are directed to a person's cell phone by using their phone carrier's email address assigned to their phone.
The notification services are also useful for developers to implement their own software applications. Calendar reminders and change events are published to a Java Message Service using Sun Java System Message Queue.
Developers may use the WCAP interface to write their own applications which access calendars, tasks, and look up "free busy" information on users. This interface returns calendar data in a number of formats including XML and iCalendar. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format was added to support AJAX development in the latest patch of Calendar Server 6.3.
