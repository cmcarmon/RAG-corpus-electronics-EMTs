A shear stress about the crystallographic axes will not lift the degeneracy; hence, P44 = 0. Similarly, a tensile
stress along the <111> does not destroy the three-fold symmetry, and the degeneracy will not be lifted; thus,
no piezoresistance should be there. Calculations based on the deformation potential model show that P11 =
22 P 12, and P44 = 0.
