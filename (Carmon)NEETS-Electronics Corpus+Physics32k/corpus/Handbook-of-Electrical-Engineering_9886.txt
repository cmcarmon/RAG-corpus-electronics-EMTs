Lag-lead network: The phase shift versus frequency curve in a phase lag-lead network is negative, or lagging,
for low frequencies and positive, or leading, for high frequencies. The phase angle associated with the
input-output  transfer  function  is  always  positive,  or  leading.  Figures  100.16  and  100.17  illustrate  the
essential characteristics of a lag-lead network, or composite equalizer.
