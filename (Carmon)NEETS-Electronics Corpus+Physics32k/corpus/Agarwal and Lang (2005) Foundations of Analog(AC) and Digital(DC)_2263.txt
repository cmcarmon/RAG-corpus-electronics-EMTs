Any time vi is less than vC, the circuit will be forced into the ON state. The
degenerate nature of the circuit, which is modeled here as having zero resis-
tance in this state, may be troublesome. Think of adding a small resistance
associated with the source, or with the forward-biased diode. Now to keep the
diode ON, the diode current iD must be positive, so
