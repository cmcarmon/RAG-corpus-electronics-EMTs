A tester hill, or trick hill, is any small hill following the lift hill or brake run that precedes the main drop. After a train is hauled up the lift and begins to descend down the hill in a standard configuration, the force of gravity pulls the train cars that are still hooked to the lift. When a tester hill is used, the tension and stress on the lift mechanism is reduced prior to the train's release. Some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters feature this element, as well as some older roller coasters from other manufacturers.
The alternative name "trick hill" comes from the illusion created from the tester hill, which "tricks" riders into thinking they have already started the main descent, when in fact they haven't.
