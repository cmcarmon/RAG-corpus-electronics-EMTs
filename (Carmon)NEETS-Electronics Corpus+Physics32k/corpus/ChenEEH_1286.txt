. CD-recordable (CD-R) disks at ﬁrst glance, appear to be
similar to regular CD-ROMs except CD-Rs are either gold
or green instead of silver. These green and yellow colors
are dye, and they are used to simulate lands and pits. In
the initial state, the dye is transparent and allows the laser
light to pass through and reﬂect the inner layer (made out
of gold). During the writing stage, the laser power is
increased to heat up the dye, which results in a dark
spot. During the reading stage, the differences between a
dark spot and a transparent spot are interpreted as the
differences between pits and lands. Kodak is one of
the ﬁrst manufacturers to produce CD-R disks. One of the
ﬁrst uses of CD-Rs was for Kodak’s PhotoCD. CD-Rs are
being used for backing up hard disks, and they also make
it possible for individuals and small companies to manu-
facture a small number of CD-ROMs. Unfortunately, this
technology also allows many individuals and companies
to duplicate CD-ROMs and CDs without any regard for
copyright violations.
