Continuous wave (CW) radar employs a transmitter which is on all or most of the time. Unmodulated CW
radar is very simple and is able to detect the Doppler-frequency shift in the return signal from a target which
has a component of motion toward or away from the transmitter. While such a radar cannot measure range,
it  is  used  widely  in  applications  such  as  police  radars,  motion  detectors,  burglar  alarms,  proximity  fuzes  for
projectiles or missiles, illuminators for semiactive missile guidance systems (such as the Hawk surface-to-air
missile),  and  scatterometers  (used  to  measure  the  scattering  properties  of  targets  or  clutter  such  as  terrain
surfaces) [Nathanson, 1991; Saunders, 1990; Ulaby and Elachi, 1990].
