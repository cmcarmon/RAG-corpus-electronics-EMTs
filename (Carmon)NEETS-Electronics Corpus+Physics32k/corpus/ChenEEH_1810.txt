the trafﬁc. Every intermediate router along the path forwards
the PATH message to the next hop determined by the routing
protocol. The receiver, upon receiving the PATH message,
responds with the RESV message to request resources for the
ﬂow. Every intermediate router along the path can reject or
accept the request of the RESV message. If the request is
rejected, the router will send an error message to the receiver,
and the signaling process terminates. If the request is accepted,
link buffer and bandwidth are allocated to the ﬂow, and related
ﬂow state information will be installed in the router.
