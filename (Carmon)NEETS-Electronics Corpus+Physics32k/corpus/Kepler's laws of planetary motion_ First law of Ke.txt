The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.

Mathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:




r
=


p

ε

cos

θ



,


{\displaystyle r={\frac {p}{1+\varepsilon \,\cos \theta }},}

where



p


{\displaystyle p}
is the semi-latus rectum, ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse, r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So (r, θ) are polar coordinates.
For an ellipse 0 < ε < 1 ; in the limiting case ε = 0, the orbit is a circle with the sun at the centre (i.e. where there is zero eccentricity).
At θ = 0°, perihelion, the distance is minimum

At θ = 90° and at θ = 270° the distance is equal to

At θ = 180°, aphelion, the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is – invariably – perihelion plus 180°)

The special case of a circle is ε = 0, resulting in r = p = rmin = rmax = a = b and A = πr2.
