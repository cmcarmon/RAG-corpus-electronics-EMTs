At the output of the discriminator in an FM receiver, higher frequency components of output
noise power are accentuated. A low-pass ﬁlter, known as a deemphasis ﬁlter, is added so that
the large-amplitude noise can be greatly reduced and the output SNR increased. Since the ﬁlter
also acts on the message, causing distortion, the message at the transmitter is passed through
a compensating ﬁlter, called a preemphasis ﬁlter, before modulation occurs. It accentuates the
higher frequencies in the message so as to exactly compensate for the effect of the deemphasis
ﬁlter, so that there is no overall effect on the message (see also Section 14.3). The scheme is
illustrated in Figure 15.2.18.
