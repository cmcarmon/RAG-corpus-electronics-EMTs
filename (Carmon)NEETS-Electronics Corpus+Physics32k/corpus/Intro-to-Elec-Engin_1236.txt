*13.2.7 A three-phase induction motor, operating at its
rated voltage and frequency, develops a starting
torque of 1.6 times the full-load torque and a
maximum torque of 2 times the full-load torque.
Neglecting stator resistance and rotational losses,
and assuming constant rotor resistance, deter-
mine the slip at maximum torque and the slip
at full load.
