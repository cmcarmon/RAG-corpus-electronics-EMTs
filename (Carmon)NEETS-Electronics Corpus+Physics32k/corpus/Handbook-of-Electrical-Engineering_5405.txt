Status of System Development
Despite  the  elegance  of  the  physics  of  the  emitters,  optical  control,  and  PV  converters,  the  engineering  of
components and system designs to minimize optical and thermal losses is probably the major near-term barrier.
Monte Carlo analyses of photon paths have provided insights into the mechanisms of photon loss for charac-
teristic Lambertian emission proﬁles. These analyses yield some surprising results. Off-normal angle of inci-
dence and internal reﬂection can multiply the effective cross section of absorbing or reﬂecting materials. As
mentioned, the emitter operates at relatively high temperatures and must maintain a highly uniform temper-
ature  proﬁle.  Considerations  of  view  factor  and  power  density  require  close  spacing  between  hot  and  cool
components.  Thus,  some  designs  include  evacuation  of  the  region  between  emitter  and  converter.  Small
oversights  in  estimating  conductive  losses  have  also  broadened  the  gap  between  predicted  and  achieved
performance.
