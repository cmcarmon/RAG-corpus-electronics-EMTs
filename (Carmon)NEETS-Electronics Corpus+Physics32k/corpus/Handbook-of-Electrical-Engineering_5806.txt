The Three-Phase Transformer
It  is  possible  to  construct  a  device  (called  a  three-phase  trans-
former) which allows the phase ï¬‚uxes to share common magnetic
return  paths.  Such  designs  allow  considerable  savings  in  core
material, and corresponding economies in cost, size, and weight.
Positive  and  negative  sequence  impedances  are  equal;  however,
the  zero  sequence  impedance  may  be  different.  Otherwise  the
circuits of Fig. 64.7 apply as discussed previously.
