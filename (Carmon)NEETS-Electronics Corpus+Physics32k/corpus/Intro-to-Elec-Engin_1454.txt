FM demodulators mainly fall into two categories: frequency discriminators and locked-loop
demodulators. While both give the same performance for relatively high signal levels, locked-
loop demodulators provide better performance than the discriminator when signal levels are
low and noise is a problem. The discriminator produces an output voltage proportional to the
frequency variations that occur in the FM signal at its input. Locked-loop demodulators are more
cost-efÔ¨Åcient when implemented in IC form.
