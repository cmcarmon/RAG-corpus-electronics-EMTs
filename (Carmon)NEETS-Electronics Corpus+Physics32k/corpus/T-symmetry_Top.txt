T-symmetry or time reversal symmetry is the theoretical symmetry of physical laws under the transformation of time reversal:




T
:
t
↦
−
t
.


{\displaystyle T:t\mapsto -t.}

Although in restricted contexts one may find this symmetry, the observable universe itself does not show symmetry under time reversal, primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics. Hence time is said to be non-symmetric, or asymmetric, except for equilibrium states when the second law of thermodynamics predicts the time symmetry to hold. However, quantum noninvasive measurements are predicted to violate time symmetry even in equilibrium, contrary to their classical counterparts, although it has not yet been experimentally confirmed.
Time asymmetries are generally distinguished as among those...
intrinsic to the dynamic physical law (e.g., for the weak force)
due to the initial conditions of our universe (e.g., for the second law of thermodynamics)
due to measurements (e.g., for the noninvasive measurements)
