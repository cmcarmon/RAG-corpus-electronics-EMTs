When the two elements are connected by a shorted 1/4-wavelength stub, as shown in view B, current 
travels down one side of the stub and up the other. It travels a distance of a 1/2 wavelength in the stub 
itself. As a result, the current moves through 1/2 cycle of change. When the current reaches the second 
element, it is in the desired phase. Since the current on one side of the stub is equal and opposite to the 
current on the other side, the fields produced here cancel and no radiation is transmitted from the stub 
itself.
