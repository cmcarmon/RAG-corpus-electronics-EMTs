ment.  If  someone  were  to  ask  you,  “What’s 
your distance?” you’d probably say, “Distance 
from what?” Similarly, if you’re asked, “What’s 
the voltage at the point in the circuit where the 
current enters the LED?” you should ask, “With 
respect to what point in the circuit?” On the 
other hand, you may say, “I’m five miles from 
home,” and you’ve stated your distance from 
a reference point (home). So if you say, “The 
voltage  where  the  current  enters  the  bulb  is  
1.7 volts with respect to ground,” that makes 
perfect sense.
