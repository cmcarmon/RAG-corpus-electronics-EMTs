Electrical Characteristics
Before considering the dielectric properties, we will consider the equivalent circuit for a slab of ferroelectric
material. In Fig. 49.3 the circuit shows a mechanical (acoustic) component and the static or clamped capacity
Co  (and  the  dielectric  loss  Rd)  which  are  connected  in  parallel.  The  acoustic  components  are  due  to  their
motional or mechanical equivalents, the compliance (capacity, C) and the mass (inductance, L). There will be
mechanical losses, which are indicated in the mechanical branch by R. The electrical branch has the clamped
capacity  Co  and  a  dielectric  loss  (Rd),  distinct  from  the  mechanical  losses.  This  conﬁguration  will  have  a
resonance which is usually assumed to correspond to the mechanical thickness mode but can represent other
modes as well. This simple model does not show the many other modes a slab (or rod) of material will have.
Thus transverse, plate, and ﬂexural modes are present. Each can be represented by its own combination of L,
C, and R. The presence of a large number of modes often causes difﬁculties in characterizing the material since
some parameters must be measured either away from the resonances or from clean, nonoverlapping resonances.
For instance, the clamped capacity (or clamped dielectric constant) of a material is measured at high frequencies
where there are usually a large number of modes present. For an accurate measurement these must be avoided
and often a low-frequency measurement is made in which the material is physically clamped to prevent motion.
This  yields  the  static,  nonmechanical  capacity,  Co.  The  circuit  can  be  approximated  at  low  frequencies  by
ignoring the inductor and redeﬁning R and C. Thus, the coupling constant can be extracted from the value of
C and Co. From the previous deﬁnition of k we ﬁnd
