Many researchers at this time had computing resources available under the scenario described in the Ô¨Årst
paragraph above. The idea of interconnecting the computers to extend the reach of these researchers to other
computers  developed.  In  addition,  the  interconnection  of  the  computers  would  provide  for  communication
among  the  researchers  themselves.  In  order  to  investigate  the  feasibility  of  providing  the  interconnectivity
  the  Advanced  Research  Projects
anticipated  for  the  future  using  a  new  technology  called 
Agency (ARPA) of the Department of the Army sponsored a networking effort, which resulted in the computer
communication network called the ARPANET.
