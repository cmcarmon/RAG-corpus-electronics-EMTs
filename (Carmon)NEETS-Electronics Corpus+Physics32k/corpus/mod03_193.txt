The ZERO OHMS control is a potentiometer for adjusting the 0 reading on ohmmeter functions.
Notice that this is a series ohmmeter. The RESET is a circuit breaker used to protect the meter movement
(circuit breakers will be discussed in chapter 2 of this module). Not all multimeters have this protection
but most have some sort of protection, such as a fuse. When the multimeter is not in use, it should have
the leads disconnected and be switched to the highest voltage scale and AC. These switch positions are
the ones most likely to prevent damage if the next person using the meter plugs in the meter leads and
connects the meter leads to a circuit without checking the function switch and the dc/ac selector.
