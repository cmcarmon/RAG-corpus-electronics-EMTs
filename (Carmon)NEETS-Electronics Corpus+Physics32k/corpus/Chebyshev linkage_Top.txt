The Chebyshev linkage is a mechanical linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion.
It was invented by the nineteenth-century mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who studied theoretical problems in kinematic mechanisms. One of the problems was the construction of a linkage that converts a rotary motion into an approximate straight-line motion. This was also studied by James Watt in his improvements to the steam engine.
The straight-line linkage confines the point P – the midpoint on the link L3 – on a straight line at the two extremes and at the center of travel. (L1, L2, L3, and L4 are as shown in the illustration.) Between those points, point P deviates slightly from a perfect straight line. The proportions between the links are

{\displaystyle L_{1}:L_{2}:L_{3}=2:2.5:1=4:5:2.\,}

Point P is in the middle of L3. This relationship assures that the link L3 lies vertically when it is at one of the extremes of its travel.
The lengths are related mathematically as follows:

{\displaystyle L_{4}=L_{3}+{\sqrt {L_{2}^{2}-L_{1}^{2}}}.\,}

It can be shown that if the base proportions described above are taken as lengths, then for all cases,

{\displaystyle L_{4}=L_{2}.\,}

and this contributes to the perceived straight-line motion of point P.
