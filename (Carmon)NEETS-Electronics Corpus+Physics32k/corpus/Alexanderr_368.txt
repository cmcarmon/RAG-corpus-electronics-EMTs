7.8
As we discussed in Section 7.5, the transient response is the temporary
response  of  the  circuit  that  soon  disappears.  PSpice can  be  used  to
obtain  the  transient  response  of  a  circuit  with  storage  elements.  Sec-
tion  D.4  in Appendix  D  provides  a  review  of  transient  analysis  using
PSpice  for  Windows.  It  is  recommended  that  you  read  Section  D.4
before continuing with this section.
