An infinitesimal angular displacement is a infinitesimal rotation matrix:
As any rotation matrix has a single real eigenvalue, which is +1, this eigenvalue shows the rotation axis.
Its module can be deduced from the value of the infinitesimal rotation.
The shape of the matrix is like this:




A
=


(



1


−

ϕ

z

)

{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}1&-d\phi _{z}(t)&d\phi _{y}(t)\\d\phi _{z}(t)&1&-d\phi _{x}(t)\\-d\phi _{y}(t)&d\phi _{x}(t)&1\\\end{pmatrix}}}

We can introduce here the infinitesimal angular displacement tensor or rotation generator associated:

{\displaystyle d\Phi (t)={\begin{pmatrix}0&-d\phi _{z}(t)&d\phi _{y}(t)\\d\phi _{z}(t)&0&-d\phi _{x}(t)\\-d\phi _{y}(t)&d\phi _{x}(t)&0\\\end{pmatrix}}}

Such that its associated rotation matrix is



A
=
I
+
d
Φ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle A=I+d\Phi (t)}
. When it is divided by the time, this will yield the angular velocity vector.
