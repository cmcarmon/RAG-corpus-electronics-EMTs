Unfortunately, the preceding examples are a rather special case. There are
many nonlinear circuits that cannot be solved analytically. The simple circuit
in Figure 4.16 is one such example. Usually we must resort to trial-and-error
solutions on a computer. Such solutions provide answers, but usually give
little insight about circuit performance and design. Graphical solutions, on the
other hand, provide insight at the expense of accuracy. So let us re-examine
the circuit in Figure 4.16 with a graphical solution in mind. For concreteness,
we will assume that E = 3 V and R = 500 , and that we are required to
determine vD, iD, and vR.
