The operating principle for this ammeter is identical to the clamp-on style of meter: the
circular magnetic ﬁeld surrounding a current-carrying conductor deﬂects the meter’s needle,
producing an indication on the scale. Note how there are two current scales on this particular
meter: +/- 75 amps and +/- 400 amps. These two measurement scales correspond to the two sets
of notches on the back of the meter. Depending on which set of notches the current-carrying
conductor is laid in, a given strength of magnetic ﬁeld will have a different amount of effect on
the needle. In effect, the two different positions of the conductor relative to the movement act
as two different range resistors in a direct-connection style of ammeter.
