The effects of clipping were Ô¨Årst approximated by Saleh [1989], who calculated the modulation level at which
the total power contained in all orders of distortion became appreciable. Even for perfectly linear lasers, the
modulation depth is bounded to values beyond which all orders of distortion increase rapidly. Assuming that
half the total power in all orders of distortion generated by clipping is distributed evenly over each of N channels,
clipping results in a carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) given by
