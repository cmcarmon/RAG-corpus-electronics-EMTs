Every amplifier has a frequency-response curve associated with it. Technicians use frequency-response
curves because they provide a "picture" of the performance of an amplifier at various frequencies. You
will probably never have to draw a frequency-response curve, but, in order to use one, you should know
how a frequency-response curve is created. The amplifier for which the frequency-response curve is
created is tested at various frequencies. At each frequency, the input signal is set to some predetermined
level of voltage (or current). This same voltage (or current) level for all of the input signals is used to
provide a standard input and to allow evaluation of the output of the circuit at each of the frequencies
tested. For each of these frequencies, the output is measured and marked on a graph. The graph is marked
"frequency" along the horizontal axis and "voltage" or "current" along the vertical axis. When points have
been plotted for all of the frequencies tested, the points are connected to form the frequency-response
curve. The shape of the curve represents the frequency response of the amplifier.
