The circuit in Figure 4.29 is linear, so any of our linear techniques can be used. We will
use superposition to solve this circuit. According to the first step of the superposition
method, for each independent source, we must form a subcircuit with all other indepen-
dent sources set to zero. Setting a voltage source to zero implies replacing the voltage
source with a short circuit, and setting a current source to zero implies replacing the
current source with an open circuit. Figure 4.30a shows the subcircuit with the voltage
source set to zero, and Figure 4.30b shows the subcircuit with the current source set
to zero.
