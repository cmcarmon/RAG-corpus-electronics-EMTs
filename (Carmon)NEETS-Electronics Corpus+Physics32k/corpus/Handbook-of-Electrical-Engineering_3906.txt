Antenna: A physical device for transmitting or receiving propagating waves.
Aperture antenna: An antenna with a physical opening, hole, or slit. Contrast with a wire antenna.
Array antenna: An antenna system performing as a single aperture but composed of antenna subsystems.
Directivity: The ratio of the maximum to average radiation intensity.
Fraunhofer or far Ô¨Åeld: The propagation region where the normalized angular radiation pattern is indepen-
dent  of  distance  from  the  source. This  typically  occurs  when  the  distance  from  the  source  is  at  least
2L2/l, where L is the largest dimension of the antenna.
