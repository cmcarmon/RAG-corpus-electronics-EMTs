Resistance affects the resonance curve of a series circuit in two ways â€” the lower the resistance, the 
higher the current; also, the lower the resistance, the sharper the curve. Because low resistance causes 
high Q, these two facts are usually expressed as functions of Q. That is, the higher the Q, the higher and 
sharper the curve and the more selective the circuit.
