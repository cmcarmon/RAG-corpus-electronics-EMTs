Several disaster films center on actual or threatened impact events. Released during the turbulence of World War I, the Danish feature film The End of the World revolves around the near-miss of a comet which causes fire showers and social unrest in Europe. When Worlds Collide (1951), based on a 1933 novel by Philip Wylie, deals with two planets on a collision course with Earthâ€”the smaller planet a "near miss," causing extensive damage and destruction, followed by a direct hit from the larger planet.
Meteor (1979) features small asteroid fragments and a large 8 km (5 mi)-wide asteroid heading for Earth after being wrenched out of orbit by a collision with a comet. Orbiting U.S. and Soviet nuclear weapons platforms are turned away from their respective earthbound targets and toward the incoming threat. The concept for this defense mechanism was taken from a 1968 MIT study called "Project Icarus."
In 1998, two films were released in the United States on the subject of attempting to stop impact events: Paramount/DreamWorks' Deep Impact, about a comet, and Touchstone Pictures' Armageddon, about an asteroid. Both involved using Space Shuttle-derived craft to deliver nuclear weapons to destroy their targets. The 2008 American Broadcasting Company's miniseries Impact deals with a splinter of a brown dwarf hidden in a meteor shower which strikes the Moon and sends it on a collision course with Earth. The 2011 film Melancholia uses the motif of an impact event incorporated in the aesthetics of Romanticism.
