Imaging and the CIS
Imaging  plays  two  very  important  roles  within  the  context  of  a  computer-based  record  (CBR).  Document
imaging allows for all those records that exist today in storage for the medical records departments to be scanned
and incorporated electronically with the rest of the patientâ€™s current records existing in the HIS and CIS. The
second role is from the perspective of clinical images. Most imaging experts will call this PACS, which stands
for picture archival and communications system and is mostly associated with the Radiology Department of
the hospital. We can view clinical images as a form of data which can be generated in any department.
