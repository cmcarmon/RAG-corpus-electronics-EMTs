Basic Anatomy and Physiology
To fully appreciate the engineering systems used to model
speech, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the living
system that produces it. We ﬁrst give a very brief overview of the
anatomical structures that comprise the human speech produc-
tion system. Then, with the aid of some primitive processing of
a speech waveform, we discuss the physiology of speech pro-
duction. The principal aim of this cursory treatment of speech
‘‘biology’’ is to provide justiﬁcation for the discrete-time (DT)
model used pervasively in contemporary speech processing.
