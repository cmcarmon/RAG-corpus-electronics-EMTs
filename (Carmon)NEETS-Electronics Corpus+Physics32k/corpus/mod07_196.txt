JUNCTION BARRIER is an electrostatic field that has been created by the joining of a section of
N material with a section of P material. Since holes and electrons must overcome this field to cross the
junction, the electrostatic field is commonly called a BARRIER. Because there is a lack or depletion of
free electrons and holes in the area around the barrier, this area has become known as the DEPLETION
REGION.
