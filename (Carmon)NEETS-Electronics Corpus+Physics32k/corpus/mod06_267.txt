Because the screen grid is in the electron stream, it will always draw some current. The current
drawn by the screen grid will be lost to the plate. This means that the transconductance of a tetrode, which
is based on the amount of plate current versus control-grid voltage, will be lower in tetrodes than in
triodes. The formula for transconductance of a triode,
