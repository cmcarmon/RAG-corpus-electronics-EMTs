Magnetic recording is used in a wide variety of applications and formats, ranging from relatively low-density,
low-cost  ﬂoppy  disk  drives  and  audio  recorders  to  high-density  videocassette  recorders,  digital  audio  tape
recorders, computer tape drives, rigid disk drives, and instrumentation recorders. The storage density of this
technology  has  been  advancing  at  a  very  rapid  pace. With  a  storage  density  exceeding  1  Gbit/in.2,  magnetic
recording media today can store the equivalent of about 50,000 pages of text on one square inch. This is more
than 500,000 times the storage density on the RAMAC, which was introduced in 1957 by IBM as the ﬁrst disk
drive for storage of digital information. The original Seagate 5.25-inch magnetic disk drive, introduced in 1980,
stored just 5 Mbytes. Today, instead of storing megabytes, 5.25-inch drives store tens of gigabytes, and drives
as small as 2.5 inches store over a gigabyte.
