where i(z¢,t) is the current along the channel obtained from one of
the return stroke current models mentioned above, and the geom-
etry by which the above equations are to be interpreted is shown in
Fig. 40.23. Note that the spatial integral includes the image current
below the perfectly conducting ground plane so as to take account
of reﬂections from the earth’s surface. The three terms on the right-
hand side of Eq. (40.8) [expanded in Eqs. (40.9) through (40.11)]
are called, from left to right, the electrostatic, induction, and radia-
tion  terms.  Similarly,  the  two  terms  on  the  right-hand  side  of  Eq.
(40.12) [expanded in Eqs. (40.13) and (40.14)] are termed the induc-
tion and radiation terms.
