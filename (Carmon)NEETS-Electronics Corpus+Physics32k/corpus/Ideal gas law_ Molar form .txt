How much gas is present could be specified by giving the mass instead of the chemical amount of gas. Therefore, an alternative form of the ideal gas law may be useful. The chemical amount (n) (in moles) is equal to the total mass of the gas (m) (in grams) divided by the molar mass (M) (in grams per mole):




n
=


m
M


.


{\displaystyle n={\frac {m}{M}}.}

By replacing n with m/M and subsequently introducing density ρ = m/V, we get:




P
V
=


m
M


R
T


{\displaystyle PV={\frac {m}{M}}RT}





P
=


m
V





R
T

M




{\displaystyle P={\frac {m}{V}}{\frac {RT}{M}}}





P
=
ρ


R
M


T


{\displaystyle P=\rho {\frac {R}{M}}T}

Defining the specific gas constant Rspecific(r) as the ratio R/M,




P
=
ρ

R

specific


T


{\displaystyle P=\rho R_{\text{specific}}T}

This form of the ideal gas law is very useful because it links pressure, density, and temperature in a unique formula independent of the quantity of the considered gas. Alternatively, the law may be written in terms of the specific volume v, the reciprocal of density, as




P
v
=

R

specific


T
.


{\displaystyle Pv=R_{\text{specific}}T.}

It is common, especially in engineering applications, to represent the specific gas constant by the symbol R. In such cases, the universal gas constant is usually given a different symbol such as






R
¯





{\displaystyle {\bar {R}}}
to distinguish it. In any case, the context and/or units of the gas constant should make it clear as to whether the universal or specific gas constant is being referred to.
