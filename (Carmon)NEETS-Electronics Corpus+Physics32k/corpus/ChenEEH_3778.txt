Model Topology and Size
Some variation of the Bakis topology is almost uniformly used in
speech applications because it most appropriately represents the
acoustic process. Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly,
when used with speech, an HMM with no state-transition con-
straints will often train so that it essentially represents a sequen-
tial structure (backward transition probabilities turn out zero).
Experimental evidence suggests that states frequently repre-
sent identiﬁable acoustic phenomena.17 Therefore, the number
of states is often chosen to roughly correspond to the expected
number of such phenomena in the utterance. If words are being
modeled with discrete observations, for example, 5 to 10 states
are typically used to capture the phones in the utterances.
Continuous-observation HMMs sometimes use more states. If
HMMs are used to model discrete phones or phonemes, three
states are often used—one each for onset and exit transitions
and one for the steady-state portion of the phone.
