is presented in Luenberger (1966). The Kalman ﬁlter is pre-
sented in Kalman (1960, 1961). Estimation theory and estima-
tor design are discussed in several texts (Brown and Hwang,
1992; Gelb et al., 1974; Maybeck, 1979). Practical aspects of
estimation theory including state augmentation, suboptimal
ﬁlter analysis, and applications are discussed in Farrell and
Barth (1999), Gelb et al. (1974), and Maybeck (year). Markov
parameters and FIR approximations to IIR ﬁlters are discussed
in Mendel (1995) and Moore (1981). Efﬁcient computation of
the discrete-time state transition matrix and process noise
covariance matrix are discussed in Van Loan (1978). The full
implementation of the GPS/INS system corresponding to the
example is described in Farrell (2000).
