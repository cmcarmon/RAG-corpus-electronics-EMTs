The equivalent circuits shown in Figure 11.3.4 are often known as transformer T-circuits
in which winding capacitances have been neglected. Other modiﬁcations and simpliﬁcations
of this basic T-circuit are used in practice. Approximate circuits (referred to the primary)
commonly used for the constant-frequency power-system transformer analysis are shown in
Figure 11.3.5. By moving the parallel combination of RC and j Xm from the middle to the left,
as shown in Figure 11.3.5(a), computational labor can be reduced greatly with minimal error.
The series impedance R1 + j X1 can be combined with a2R2 + j a2X2 to form an equivalent
series impedance, ¯Zeq = Req + j Xeq. Further simpliﬁcation is gained by neglecting the exciting
