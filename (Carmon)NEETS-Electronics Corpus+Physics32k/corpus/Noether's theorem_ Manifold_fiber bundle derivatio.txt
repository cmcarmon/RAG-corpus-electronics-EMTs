Suppose we have an n-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifold, M and a target manifold T. Let





C




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
be the configuration space of smooth functions from M to T. (More generally, we can have smooth sections of a fiber bundle over M.)
Examples of this M in physics include:
In classical mechanics, in the Hamiltonian formulation, M is the one-dimensional manifold R, representing time and the target space is the cotangent bundle of space of generalized positions.
In field theory, M is the spacetime manifold and the target space is the set of values the fields can take at any given point. For example, if there are m real-valued scalar fields,




φ

,
…
,

φ

m




{\displaystyle \varphi _{1},\ldots ,\varphi _{m}}
, then the target manifold is Rm. If the field is a real vector field, then the target manifold is isomorphic to R3.
Now suppose there is a functional

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}:{\mathcal {C}}\rightarrow \mathbf {R} ,}

called the action. (Note that it takes values into R, rather than C; this is for physical reasons, and doesn't really matter for this proof.)
To get to the usual version of Noether's theorem, we need additional restrictions on the action. We assume

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}[\varphi ]}

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}[\varphi ]\,=\,\int _{M}{\mathcal {L}}[\varphi (x),\partial _{\mu }\varphi (x),x]\,\mathrm {d} ^{n}x.}

Suppose we are given boundary conditions, i.e., a specification of the value of φ at the boundary if M is compact, or some limit on φ as x approaches ∞. Then the subspace of





C




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {C}}}
consisting of functions φ such that all functional derivatives of

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}}
at φ are zero, that is:

≈

{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta {\mathcal {S}}[\varphi ]}{\delta \varphi (x)}}\approx 0}

and that φ satisfies the given boundary conditions, is the subspace of on shell solutions. (See principle of stationary action)
Now, suppose we have an infinitesimal transformation on

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(x)={\mathcal {L}}[\varphi (x),\partial _{\mu }\varphi (x),x].}

If this holds on shell and off shell, we say Q generates an off-shell symmetry. If this only holds on shell, we say Q generates an on-shell symmetry. Then, we say Q is a generator of a one parameter symmetry Lie group.
Now, for any N, because of the Euler–Lagrange theorem, on shell (and only on-shell), we have

which is called the Noether current associated with the symmetry. The continuity equation tells us that if we integrate this current over a space-like slice, we get a conserved quantity called the Noether charge (provided, of course, if M is noncompact, the currents fall off sufficiently fast at infinity).
