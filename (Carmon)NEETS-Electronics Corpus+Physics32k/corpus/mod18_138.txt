The original frequency, 60 hertz, has changed to an apparent frequency of 90 hertz. This new
frequency only applies to the observer. Notice that the Doppler frequency variation is directly
proportional to the velocity of the approaching transmitter. The faster the transmitter moves toward the
observer, the greater the number of waves that will be crowded into the space between the transmitter and
the observer.
