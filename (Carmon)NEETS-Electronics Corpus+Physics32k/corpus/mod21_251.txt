The voltage at the terminals of a NICAD will normally be between 1.25 and 1.30 volts in an open-
circuit condition. This value will vary, of course, depending on the state of charge. If the charge has
dropped to a low of 1.1 volts, the NICAD should be regarded as being completely discharged and should
not be permitted to be discharged further. The majority of small NICADs are rated in milliampere hours;
the large ones are rated in ampere hours. The small NICAD is the one the technician will almost always
be concerned with.
