Blow-forward is a firearm operation type where the friction and pressure of the bullet traveling down the bore drag the barrel forward. This forward barrel motion provides most of the energy required to eject a spent cartridge case and chamber a fresh round. This mechanism contains a minimum of moving parts and is more compact than other operating mechanism of equal barrel length.
