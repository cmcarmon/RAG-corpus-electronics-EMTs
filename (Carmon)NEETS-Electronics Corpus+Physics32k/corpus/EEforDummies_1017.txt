The schematic symbols in this chapter belong 
to the drawing style used in North America 
(particularly in the United States) and in Japan. 
Some countries — notably European nations 
as well as Australia — use somewhat different 
schematic symbols. If you’re using a schematic 
for a circuit not designed in the United States 
or Japan, you need to do a wee bit o’ schematic 
translation to understand all the components.
