To figure this out, first you have to calculate the voltage drop across the 
resistor when the LED is on. You already know that the supply voltage is 9 V 
and the LED eats up 2 V. The only other component in the circuit is the resis-
tor, so you know that it will eat up the remaining supply voltage â€” all 7 V  
of it. If you want to limit the current to be no more than 20 mA, you need a 
resistor that is at least 7
