Consider two particles, denoted by subscripts 1 and 2. Let m1 and m2 be the masses, u1 and u2 the velocities before collision, and v1 and v2 the velocities after collision.
The conservation of the total momentum demands that the total momentum before the collision is the same as the total momentum after the collision, and is expressed by the equation

{\displaystyle \,\!m_{1}{\vec {u}}_{1}+m_{2}{\vec {u}}_{2}=m_{1}{\vec {v}}_{1}+m_{2}{\vec {v}}_{2}.}

Likewise, the conservation of the total kinetic energy is expressed by the equation

{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{1}u_{1}^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {m_{2}u_{2}^{2}}{2}}={\frac {m_{1}v_{1}^{2}}{2}}+{\frac {m_{2}v_{2}^{2}}{2}}.}

These equations may be solved directly to find vi when ui are known or vice versa. An alternative solution is to first change the frame of reference such that one of the known velocities is zero. The unknown velocities in the new frame of reference can then be determined and followed by a conversion back to the original frame of reference to reach the same result. Once one of the unknown velocities is determined, the other can be found by symmetry.
Solving these simultaneous equations for vi we get:

The latter is the trivial solution, corresponding to the case that no collision has taken place.
For example:
Ball 1: mass = 3 kg, velocity = 4 m/s
Ball 2: mass = 5 kg, velocity = −6 m/s
After collision:
Ball 1: velocity = −8.5 m/s
Ball 2: velocity = 1.5 m/s

{\displaystyle \Rightarrow m_{1}\left(v_{1}-u_{1}\right)\left(v_{1}+u_{1}\right)=m_{2}\left(u_{2}-v_{2}\right)\left(u_{2}+v_{2}\right)}

Rearrange momentum equation:

the relative velocity of one particle with respect to the other is reversed by the collision
the average of the momenta before and after the collision is the same for both particles

As can be expected, the solution is invariant under adding a constant to all velocities, which is like using a frame of reference with constant translational velocity.

The velocity of the center of mass does not change by the collision:
The center of mass at time




t


{\displaystyle \ t}
before the collision and at time





t

{\displaystyle \ t'}
after the collision is given by two equations:

{\displaystyle {\bar {x}}(t')={\frac {m_{1}x_{1}(t')+m_{2}x_{2}(t')}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}}

Hence, the velocities of the center of mass before and after the collision are:

{\displaystyle \ v_{\bar {x}}'}

With respect to the center of mass both velocities are reversed by the collision: in the case of particles of different mass, a heavy particle moves slowly toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same low speed, and a light particle moves fast toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the same high speed.
From the equations for





v

1




{\displaystyle \ v_{1}}
and





v

2




{\displaystyle \ v_{2}}
above we see that in the case of a large





u

1




{\displaystyle \ u_{1}}
, the value of





v

1




{\displaystyle \ v_{1}}
is small if the masses are approximately the same: hitting a much lighter particle does not change the velocity much, hitting a much heavier particle causes the fast particle to bounce back with high speed.

This is why a neutron moderator (a medium which slows down fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a chain reaction) is a material full of atoms with light nuclei (with the additional property that they do not easily absorb neutrons): the lightest nuclei have about the same mass as a neutron.
