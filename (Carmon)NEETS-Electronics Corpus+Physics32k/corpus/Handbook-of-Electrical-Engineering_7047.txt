The algorithm for tree construction is illustrated for a source with distribution (0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1) in Fig. 73.21.
After constructing the tree, the leaves of the tree (which correspond to the symbols of  X) can be assigned code
words that correspond to the paths from the root to the leaf. We will not give a proof of the optimality of the
Huffman algorithm; the reader is referred to Gallager [1968] or Cover and Thomas [1991] for details.
