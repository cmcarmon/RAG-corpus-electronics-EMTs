The applications of the SCR as a rectifier are many. In fact, its many applications as a rectifier give 
this semiconductor device its name. When alternating current is applied to a rectifier, only the positive or 
negative halves of the sine wave flow through. All of each positive or negative half cycle appears in the 
output. When an SCR is used, however, the controlled rectifier may be turned on at any time during the 
half cycle, thus controlling the amount of dc power available from zero to maximum, as shown in figure 
3-22. Since the output is actually dc pulses, suitable filtering can be added if continuous direct current is 
needed. Thus any dc operated device can have controlled amounts of power applied to it. Notice that the 
SCR must be turned on at the desired time for each cycle.
