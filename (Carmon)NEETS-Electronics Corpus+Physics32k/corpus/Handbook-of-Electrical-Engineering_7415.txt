Telemetering the measurement signal of the best transducers in no way degrades the measurement below
accuracies attainable under laboratory conditions. For instance, in strain measurement it is possible to achieve
accuracies of a few microinches per inch or greater, but the limitation is usually the degree of stability in the
bond of the strain gauge to the specimen.
