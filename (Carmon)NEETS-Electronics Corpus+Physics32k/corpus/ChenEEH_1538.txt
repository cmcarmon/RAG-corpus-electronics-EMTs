Although it is not mandatory, ﬁle names with certain dot
extensions have been associated with certain applications. For
example, ﬁle names with a .doc extension are usually associ-
ated with Microsoft word processors, such as MS-Word. The
capability of associating ﬁle names to applications has been
implemented in the Microsoft Windows as a convenient oper-
ating system feature. Some examples of such associations are
listed in Table 4.5.
