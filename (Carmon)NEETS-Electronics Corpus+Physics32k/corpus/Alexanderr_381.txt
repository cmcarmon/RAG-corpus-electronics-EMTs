7.9.2 Photoﬂash Unit
An electronic ﬂash unit provides a common example of an RC circuit.
This  application  exploits  the  ability  of  the  capacitor  to  oppose  any
abrupt change in voltage. Figure 7.75 shows a simpliﬁed circuit. It con-
sists  essentially  of  a  high-voltage  dc  supply,  a  current-limiting  large
resistor 
and  a  capacitor  C in  parallel  with  the  ﬂashlamp  of  low
resistance  When  the  switch  is  in  position  1,  the  capacitor  charges
slowly due  to  the  large  time  constant  (
).  As  shown  in
Fig. 7.76(a), the capacitor voltage rises gradually from zero to  while
its current decreases gradually from 
to zero. The charging
time is approximately ﬁve times the time constant,
