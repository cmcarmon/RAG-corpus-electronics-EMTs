Wind-Electric Conversion
Wind  energy  is  intermittent,  highly  variable,  and  site-speciﬁc,  exists  in  three  dimensions,  and  is  the  least
dependent  upon  latitude  among  all  renewable  resources.  The  power  density  (in W/unit  area)  in  moving  air
(wind) is a cubic function of wind speed and therefore even small increases in average wind speeds can lead
to  signiﬁcant  increases  in  the  capturable  energy.  Wind  sites  are  typically  classiﬁed  as  good,  excellent,  or
outstanding, with associated mean wind speeds of 13, 16, and 19 mph, respectively.
