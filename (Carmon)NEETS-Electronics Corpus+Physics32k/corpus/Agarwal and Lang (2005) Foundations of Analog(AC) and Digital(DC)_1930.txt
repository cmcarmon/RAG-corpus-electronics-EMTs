The frequency response of several of the circuits considered in the previ-
ous sections indicated their frequency selective behavior (for example, the
RL circuit in Figure 13.11 or the RC circuit in Figure 13.15). We can use
such circuits to process signals according to their frequency. Circuits used
in this manner are called filters. Filters are a major application of frequency
domain analysis. The signal-processing property of filtering is fundamental
to the operation of all television, radio, and cellular phone receivers, which
must select one transmitted signal from among many present at the receiver
antenna.
