particle radiation). The larger die sizes also mean that there is
more likelihood of failure. Thus, increasing the reliability of
FPGA devices via testing and fault-tolerance techniques is
necessary for achieving various goals ranging from increasing
device fabrication yield (thus lowering costs) to increasing the
availability and reliability of systems ranging from ofÔ¨Åce prod-
ucts to mission- and life-critical systems.
