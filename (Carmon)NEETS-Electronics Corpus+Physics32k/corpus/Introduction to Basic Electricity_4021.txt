Figure 39-7 shows a shunt-fed Hartley oscillator 
with the addition of a crystal. The crystal is connected 
in series with the feedback circuit. If the frequency of 
the tank circuit drifts from the crystal frequency, the 
impedance of the crystal increases, reducing  feedback 
to the tank circuit. This allows the tank circuit to 
 return to the frequency of the crystal.
