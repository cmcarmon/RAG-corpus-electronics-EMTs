Integrated circuits are easily damaged with static elec-
tricity that is referred to as electrostatic discharge 
(ESD). ESD is a static discharge and occurs when two 
positively charged substances are rubbed together or 
separated, causing a transfer or electrons so that one 
substance becomes negatively charged. When either 
substance comes in contact with a conductor, an elec-
trical current flows until it is at the same electrical 
potential as ground. ESD is commonly experienced 
more during the winter months when the environ-
ment is dry.
