2 X∞ , and Z∞ = Y∞(I – γ–2X∞Y∞)–1. The dynamic part of the above
where C2z = C2 + γ–2D21B T
compensator  can  be  interpreted  as  an  estimate  of  the  state  assuming  that  the  worst-case  disturbance  w*  is
present. The control signal is a linear feedback of the estimated state, just as in the LQG case. Although the
controller formulas above look more complicated than in the LQG case, this is largely due to the fact that the
controlled variable z has a more general form in the H∞ problem statement above. It should be noted, however,
that unlike the LQG case, the solution of the Riccati equations is coupled in the H∞ case due to condition 3 above.
