Electromagnetic Equation
Figure  1.24  shows  a  magnetic  core  with  the  area  of  cross  section  A  =  W  ·  D  m2.  The  transformer  primary
winding that consists of N turns is excited by a sinusoidal voltage v = V sin(wt), where w is the angular frequency
given by the expression w = 2pf and f  is the frequency of the applied voltage waveform. f is magnetic ﬁeld in
the core due to the excitation current i:
