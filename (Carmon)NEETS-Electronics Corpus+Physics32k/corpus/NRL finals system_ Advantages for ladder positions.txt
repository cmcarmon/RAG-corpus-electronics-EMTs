Under this finals system, the final eight teams are broken up into four groups of two. Each group of two earns one extra benefit over the teams beneath it. These benefits are home ground finals and the double-chance, whereby a first-week loss will not eliminate the team from the finals. Note that the "home" designations may be irrelevant for games played between teams from the same state - all finals games played between two Sydney based teams will be held at Allianz Stadium or ANZ Stadium, regardless of the "home" team's home ground.
