LFC and the ED functions both operate automatically in real time but with vastly different time periods.
Both adjust generation levels, but LFC does it every few seconds to follow the load variation, while ED does it
every  few  minutes  to  assure  minimal  cost.  Conﬂicting  control  action  is  avoided  by  coordinating  the  control
errors. If the unit control errors from LFC and ED are in the same direction, there is no conﬂict. Otherwise,
a logic is set to either follow load (permissive control) or follow economics (mandatory control).
