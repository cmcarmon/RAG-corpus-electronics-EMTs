Now let us consider more than one element at a time. This brings us to the term "compound." A
compound is a chemical combination of two or more elements. Water, table salt, ethyl alcohol, and
ammonia are all examples of compounds. The smallest part of a compound, which has all the
characteristics of the compound, is the molecule. Each molecule contains some of the atoms of each of
the elements forming the compound.
