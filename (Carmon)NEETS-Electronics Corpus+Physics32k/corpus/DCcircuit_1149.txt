It should be common-sense knowledge that liquids ﬂow through large-diameter pipes easier
than they do through small-diameter pipes (if you would like a practical illustration, try drink-
ing a liquid through straws of different diameters). The same general principle holds for the
ﬂow of electrons through conductors: the broader the cross-sectional area (thickness) of the
conductor, the more room for electrons to ﬂow, and consequently, the easier it is for ﬂow to
occur (less resistance).
