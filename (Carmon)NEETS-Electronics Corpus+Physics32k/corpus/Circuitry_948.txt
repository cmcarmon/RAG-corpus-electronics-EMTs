I
where I represents load current, V represents output 
voltage, and ] means ‘is proportional to’. 
 
In  some  cases,  an  increase  in  one  quantity  will 
produce  a  reduction  in  another  quantity.  For 
example,  if  the  frequency  of  a  wavelength  of  a 
radio wave increases its wavelength is reduced. To 
put  this  in  a  mathematical  way  we  say  that 
(provided the speed of travel remains constant): 
 
wavelength is inversely proportional frequency  
 
Using  mathematical  notation  and  symbols 
to 
represent  the  quantities,  we  would  write  this  as 
follows:
