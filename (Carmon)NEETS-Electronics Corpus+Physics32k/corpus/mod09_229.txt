If there were absolutely no internal resistances in a tank circuit, oscillations would continue 
indefinitely, as shown in figure 2-3, view (A). Each resonant circuit does, however, contain some 
resistance which dissipates power. This power loss causes the amplitude to decrease, as shown in views 
(B) and (C). The reduction of amplitude in an oscillator circuit is referred to as DAMPING. Damping is 
caused by both tank and load resistances. The larger the tank resistance, the greater the amount of 
damping. Loading the tank causes the same effect as increasing the internal resistance of the tank. The 
effect of this damping can be overcome by applying regenerative feedback.
