Considering Figure 4.3.1, let balanced positive-sequence, three-phase voltages with ¯VAB =
3(cid:2) 0° V (rms) be applied to terminals A, B, and C. The three-phase wye-connected balanced
100
load consists of a per-phase impedance of (10 + j10). Determine the wattmeter readings of
WA and WC. Then ﬁnd the total three-phase real and reactive powers delivered to the load. Based
on the wattmeter readings of WA and WC, compute the load power factor and check the sign
associated with the power factor angle.
