A suction cup, also known as a sucker, is a device or object that uses the negative fluid pressure of air or water to adhere to nonporous surfaces, creating a partial vacuum.
Suction cups are peripherial traits of some animals such as octopuses and squids, and have been reproduced artificially for numerous purposes.
