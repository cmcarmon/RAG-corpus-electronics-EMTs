Another accurate method for measuring the elementary charge is by inferring it from measurements of two effects in quantum mechanics: The Josephson effect, voltage oscillations that arise in certain superconducting structures; and the quantum Hall effect, a quantum effect of electrons at low temperatures, strong magnetic fields, and confinement into two dimensions. The Josephson constant is

J

h




{\displaystyle K_{\mathrm {J} }={\frac {2e}{h}}}

(where h is the Planck constant). It can be measured directly using the Josephson effect.
The von Klitzing constant is

.


{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {K} }={\frac {h}{e^{2}}}.}

It can be measured directly using the quantum Hall effect.
From these two constants, the elementary charge can be deduced:
