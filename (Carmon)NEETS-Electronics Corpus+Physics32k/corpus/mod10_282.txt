The recombination process also depends on the time of day. Between the hours of early morning and 
late afternoon, the rate of ionization exceeds the rate of recombination. During this period, the ionized 
layers reach their greatest density and exert maximum influence on radio waves. During the late afternoon 
and early evening hours, however, the rate of recombination exceeds the rate of ionization, and the 
density of the ionized layers begins to decrease. Throughout the night, density continues to decrease, 
reaching a low point just before sunrise.
