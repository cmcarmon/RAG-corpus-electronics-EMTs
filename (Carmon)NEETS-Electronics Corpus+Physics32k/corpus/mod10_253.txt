If you know the directions of the E and H components, you can use the "right-hand rule" (see figure 
2-6) to determine the direction of wave propagation. This rule states that if the thumb, forefinger, and 
middle finger of the right hand are extended so they are mutually perpendicular, the middle finger will 
point in the direction of wave propagation if the thumb points in the direction of the E field and the 
forefinger points in the direction of the H field. Since both the E and H fields reverse directions 
simultaneously, propagation of a particular wavefront is always in the same direction (away from the 
antenna).
