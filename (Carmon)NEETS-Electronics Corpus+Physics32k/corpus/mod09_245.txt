The power gain and voltage gain of the common-base configuration are high enough to give 
satisfactory operation in an oscillator circuit. The wide range between the input resistance and the output 
resistance make impedance matching slightly harder to achieve in the common-base circuit than in the 
common-emitter circuit. An advantage of the common-base configuration is that it exhibits better high-
frequency response than does the common-emitter configuration.
