The electrons forming the plate current also electrostatically induce potentials in the grid as they 
move past it. This electrostatic induction in the grid causes currents of positive charges to move back and 
forth in the grid structure. This back and forth action is similar to the action of hole current in 
semiconductor devices. When transit-time effect is not a factor (as in low frequencies), the current 
induced in one side of the grid by the approaching electrons is equal to the current induced on the other 
side by the receding electrons. The net effect is zero since the currents are in opposite directions and 
cancel each other. However, when transit time is an appreciable part of a cycle, the number of electrons 
approaching the grid is not always equal to the number going away. As a result, the induced currents do 
not cancel. This uncancelled current produces a power loss in the grid that is considered resistive in 
nature. In other words, the tube acts as if a resistor were connected between the grid and the cathode. The 
resistance of this imaginary resistor decreases rapidly as the frequency increases. The resistance may 
become so low that the grid is essentially short-circuited to the cathode, preventing proper operation of 
the tube.
