The "on-off" KEYING of a continuous wave (cw) carrier frequency was the principal method of 
modulating a carrier in the early days of electrical communications. The intervals of time when a carrier 
either was present or absent conveyed the desired intelligence. This is still used in modern 
communications. When applied to a continuously oscillating radio-frequency source, on-off keying is 
referred to as cw signaling. This type of communication is sometimes referred to as an interrupted 
continuous wave (icw).
