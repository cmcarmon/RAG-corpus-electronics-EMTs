Primary storage capacities are usually specified in number of bytes. The symbol "K" is used 
whenever we refer to the size of memory, especially when the memory is quite large. The symbol K is 
equal to 1,024 units or positions of storage. Therefore, if a computer has 512K bytes (not bits) of primary 
storage, then it can hold 512 Ã— 1,024 or 524,288 characters (bytes) of data in its memory.
