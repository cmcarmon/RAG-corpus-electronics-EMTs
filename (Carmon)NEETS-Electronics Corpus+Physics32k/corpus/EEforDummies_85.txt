Electrical energy isnâ€™t created from scratch. (That would go against a funda-
mental law of physics called the conservation of energy, which states that 
energy can neither be created nor destroyed.) It is generated by converting 
another form of energy (for instance, mechanical, chemical, heat, or light) 
into electrical energy. Exactly how electrical energy is generated by your 
favorite source turns out to be important because different sources produce 
different types of electric current. The two different types are
