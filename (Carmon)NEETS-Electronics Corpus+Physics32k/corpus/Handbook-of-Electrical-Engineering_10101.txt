Conﬁguration
 is a fundamental classiﬁcation for industrial robots. Conﬁguration refers to the geometry of the
robot  manipulator,  i.e.,  the  manner  in  which  the  links  of  the  manipulator  are  connected  at  each  joint.  The

deﬁnition,  attention  here  is  focused  on  industrial  manipulator  arms,  typically  mounted  on  a  ﬁxed  pedestal
base. Mobile robots and hard automation [e.g., Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines] are excluded.
The emphasis here is on serial-chain manipulator arms, which consist of a serial chain of linkages, where each
link  is  connected  to  exactly  two  other  links,  with  the  exception  of  the  ﬁrst  and  last,  which  are  connected  to
only  one  other  link. Additionally,  the  ﬁrst  three  links,  called  the  major  linkages,  are  focused  on,  with  only  a
brief mention of the last three links, or wrist joints, also called the minor linkages.
