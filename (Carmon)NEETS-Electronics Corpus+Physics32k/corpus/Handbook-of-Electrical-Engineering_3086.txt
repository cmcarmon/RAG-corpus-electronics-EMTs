Sensitivity function: A  measure  of  the  fractional  change  in  some  circuit  characteristic,  such  as  center  fre-
quency,  to  variations  in  a  circuit  parameter,  such  as  the  value  of  a  resistor.  The  sensitivity  function  is
normally deÔ¨Åned as the partial derivative of the desired circuit characteristic with respect to the element
value and is usually evaluated at the nominal value of all elements.
