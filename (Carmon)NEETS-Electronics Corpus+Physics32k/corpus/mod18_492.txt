receiver crystals. The keep-alive current is normally about 100 microamperes but falls off as the end of 
the tr tube life approaches. You can also measure the keep-alive voltage between the plate of the tr tube 
and ground when the voltage source is known to have the correct output. You then record this voltage for 
use as a reference for future checks. However, these checks are not as reliable as recovery time testing.
