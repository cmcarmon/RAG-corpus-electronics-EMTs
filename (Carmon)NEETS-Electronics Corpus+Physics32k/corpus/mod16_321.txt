SHUNT CONSTRUCTION.â€”The shunt strips (view B of figure 3-4) are usually made of the alloy
Manganin. Manganin has a temperature coefficient of almost zero. The zero-temperature coefficient
property is desirable because of the heavy currents that often flow through shunts producing heat. A zero-
temperature coefficient material is not affected by this heat; therefore, it remains stable in temperature.
Most other materials increase their resistance as they are heated. If shunts were made of these materials,
they would carry less current. More and more current would flow through the meter movement, and the
chances of damage would increase. Using shunts constructed with zero-temperature coefficient materials
eliminates this problem.
