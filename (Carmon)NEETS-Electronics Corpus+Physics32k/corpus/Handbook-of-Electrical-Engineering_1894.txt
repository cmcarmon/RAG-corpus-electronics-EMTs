The MMX extension is based on the well-known Intel architecture. It supports operations on 8-bit bytes,
16-bit words, 32-bit doublewords, and 64-bit quadwords. All these data types are packed into 64-bit words. All
MMX operations are performed in the ﬂoating-point registers; this means that the ﬂoating-point registers must
be  saved  at  the  beginning  of  MMX  code  and  restored  at  its  end.  (Although  ﬂoating-point  operations  access
these  registers  as  a  stack,  MMX  instructions  can  arbitrarily  address  the  registers.)  MMX  supports  addition,
subtraction, comparison, multiplication, shifts, and logical operations. Arithmetic can optionally be performed
in saturation mode. There are also instructions for packing and unpacking subwords into words. Some con-
version operations are provided so that intermediate calculations can be performed at higher precisions and
then converted to a smaller format.
