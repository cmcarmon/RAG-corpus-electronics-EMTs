On March 9, 2016 Liberal MP Mauril Bélanger served as honorary Speaker for about an hour to honour his years of service. Speaker Regan resumed his duties for the remainder of the sitting of the House.
Mauril Bélanger was initially the front runner for the current role, but declined due to his being diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Bélanger died on August 15, 2016, five months after being named honorary Speaker.
