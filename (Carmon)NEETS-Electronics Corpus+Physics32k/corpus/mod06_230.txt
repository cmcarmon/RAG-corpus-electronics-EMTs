The SERIES GRID-LEAK BIAS circuit shown in figure 1-26 operates similarly to the shunt grid-
leak circuit. When the first positive alternation is applied to the left-hand plate of the grid capacitor, Cg,
the left-hand plate must lose electrons to go positive with the input. Electrons will leave the left-hand
plate and flow through Rg, causing a negative (left-hand side) to positive (right-hand side) voltage drop.
From the right-hand side of Rg, the electrons will flow to the right-hand plate of Cg. The positive voltage
developed at the right-hand side of Rg will be coupled to the grid. As the grid goes positive, it will draw
current, causing Cg to start to charge through the low resistance path of the tube. During the negative
alternation of the input, Cg will discharge through the high resistance path of Rg. Once again it will not be
completely discharged at the end of the negative alternation, and the capacitor will continue on its way
toward charge equilibrium.
