The upper wafer of the schematic symbol is the wafer closest to the control mechanism, and is
identical to the wafer shown in figure 3-9(A). When switches have more than one wafer, the first wafer
shown is always the wafer closest to the operating mechanism. The lower wafer on the schematic diagram
is the wafer farthest away from the operating mechanism. Contact 9 of this wafer is connected to the
movable portion and is the point at which current enters the wafer. In the position shown, contact 9 is
connected to both contact 13 and 16. If the switch is rotated slightly clockwise, contact 9 would no longer
be connected to contact 13. A further clockwise movement would connect contact 9 to contact 12. This
arrangement is called BREAK BEFORE MAKE. Contact 9 will also be connected to contact 15 at the
same time as it is connected to contact 12.
