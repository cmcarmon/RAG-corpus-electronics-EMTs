The general class, Λ, of hidden variables is composed of two subclasses ΛR (Recurrent) and ΛN (Non-recurrent) such that ΛR∪ΛN=Λ and ΛR∩ΛN={}. The class ΛN is very large and contains random variables whose domain is the continuum, the reals . There are an uncountable infinite number of reals. Every instance of a real random variable is unique. The probability two instances are equal is zero, exactly zero. ΛN induces sample independence. All correlations are context dependent but not in the usual sense. There is no "spooky action at a distance". That fact can be captured by using random variables which, for ΛN , are independent from one experiment to the next. The existence of the class ΛN makes it impossible to derive any of the standard inequalities used to define quantum entanglement. Attempting to derive Bell's inequality when the hidden variables belong to ΛN blocks the step assuming A of AB and A of AC are equal. Those experiments occur at different times and hence share no continuous hidden variable instances. AB and AC are independent, the expected value of their product is the product of their expected values: <(AB)(AC)>=<AB><AC>. That leads to a different inequality from Bell's. The non-recurrent inequality places no constraints on the correlations. Those correlations can violate Bell's inequality even though they arise from a local model.
