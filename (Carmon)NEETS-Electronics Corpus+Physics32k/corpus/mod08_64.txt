A transistor amplifier is a current-control device. The current in the base of the transistor (which is 
dependent on the emitter-base bias) controls the current in the collector. A vacuum-tube amplifier is also 
a current-control device. The grid bias controls the plate current. These facts are expanded upon in 
NEETS Module 6, Introduction to Electronic Emission, Tubes and Power Supplies, and Module 7, 
Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies.
