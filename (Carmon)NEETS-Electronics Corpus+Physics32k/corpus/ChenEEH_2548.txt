The characteristic impedances for the even- and odd-modes of
the coupled line system can be easily found from a given
external line impedance Z0 and a speciﬁed coupling coefﬁcient
C required for the coupler design. In the TEM mode case, the
even- and odd-mode velocities are always equal and given by:
