Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  measure  the  voltage  gain  and  low-frequency 
response  of  a  simple  common-emitter  amplifier 
stage. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard, d.c. voltmeter (preferably digital), AF 
signal generator (with variable frequency sine wave 
output),  two  AF  voltmeters  (or  a  dual  beam 
oscilloscope),  9  V  d.c.  power  supply  (or  battery), 
BC108 (or similar) NPN transistor, two 470 nF and  
two 10 ÂµF capacitors, resistors of 1 MP and 2.2 kP
5% 0.25 W, test leads, connecting  wire.
