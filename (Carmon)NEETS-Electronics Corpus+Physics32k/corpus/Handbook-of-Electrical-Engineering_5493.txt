DC Circuit Breakers
Interrupting the current in ac systems is aided by the fact that ac current goes through zero every half-cycle or
approximately every 8 ms in a 60-Hz system. The absence of natural current zero in dc makes it difÔ¨Åcult to
develop a dc circuit breaker. There are three principal problems in designing a dc circuit breaker:
