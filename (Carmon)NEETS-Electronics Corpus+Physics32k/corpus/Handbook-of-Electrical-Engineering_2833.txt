SMD ICs come in a wide variety of packages, from 8-pin Small Outline Packages (SOLs) to 1000+ connection
packages in a variety of sizes and lead conﬁgurations, as shown in Fig. 26.4. The most common commercial
Quad Flat
packages currently include 
Packs
 (QFPs), and Plastic Quad Flat Packs (PQFPs) also know as Bumpered Quad Flat Packs (BQFPs). Add in
Tape Automated Bonding (TAB), Ball Grid Array (BGA) and other newer technologies, and the IC possibilities
become overwhelming. Space prevents examples of all these technologies from being included here. The reader
