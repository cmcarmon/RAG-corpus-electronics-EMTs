Using the shift register shown in figure 3-31 for scaling a number is quite simple. The number to be
scaled is loaded into the register either in serial or parallel form. Once the data is in the register, the
scaling takes place in the same manner as that for shifting the data for serial output. A single clock pulse
will cause each bit of data to shift one place to the left. Remember that each shift is the equivalent of
increasing the value by a power of 2. The scaled data is read from the parallel outputs. Care must be taken
not to over shift the data to the point that the MSDs are shifted out of the register.
