In modern operating systems, applications are separated from
the operating system itself. The operating system code runs in
a privileged processor mode known as kernel mode and has
access to system data and hardware. Applications run in a
nonprivileged processor mode are known as user mode and
have limited access to system data and hardware by making
system calls, which are actually a set of tightly controlled
application programming interfaces (APIs).
