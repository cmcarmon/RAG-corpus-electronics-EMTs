As you know, sound travels through a medium by wave motion. Although sound waves and the
electromagnetic waves used in the propagation of radio and radar differ, both types of waves have many
of the same characteristics. Studying the principles of sound-wave motion will help you understand the
actions of both sound waves and the more complex radio and radar electromagnetic waves. The major
differences among sound waves, heat waves, and light waves are (1) their frequencies; (2) their types; the
mediums through which they travel; and the velocities at which they travel.
