As the brush passes over each contact (in a positive direction), an output pulse from each contact is 
coupled to one of four counters. This advances the counter one-half count. The accelerometer is designed 
so that as acceleration decreases, the mass tends to assume the new velocity. The counters will not 
advance the remaining half count until the brush once again touches the reset contact. With this type of 
pulse output, it is possible to record each time gravity forces have reached a predetermined level.
