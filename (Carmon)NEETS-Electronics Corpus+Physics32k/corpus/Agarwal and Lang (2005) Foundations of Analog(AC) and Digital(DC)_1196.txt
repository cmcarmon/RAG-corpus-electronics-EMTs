(cid:1) The small-signal equivalent model for an independent DC voltage source is
a short circuit, while that for an independent DC current source is an open
circuit. The small-signal equivalent model for a resistor is the resistor itself.
The small-signal model for a MOSFET is shown in Figure 8.10.
