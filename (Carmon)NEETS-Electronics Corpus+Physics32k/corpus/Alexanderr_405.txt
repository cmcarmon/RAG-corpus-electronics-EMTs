Typical  examples  of  second-order  circuits  are  RLC circuits,  in
which  the  three  kinds  of  passive  elements  are  present.  Examples  of
such circuits are shown in Fig. 8.1(a) and (b). Other examples are RL
and  RC circuits,  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.1(c)  and  (d).  It  is  apparent  from
Fig. 8.1 that a second-order circuit may have two storage elements of
different  type  or  the  same  type  (provided  elements  of  the  same  type
cannot be represented by an equivalent single element). An op amp cir-
cuit with two storage elements may also be a second-order circuit. As
with  Ô¨Årst-order  circuits,  a  second-order  circuit  may  contain  several
resistors and dependent and independent sources.
