is applied to the inverter’s input, Q1’s base-emitter junction will be reverse biased
and the base-collector junction will be forward biased. This circuit condition will allow Q1 collector current
to ﬂow into the base of Q2, saturating Q2 and thereby providing base current into Q3, turning it on also. The
collector voltage of Q2 is too low to turn on Q4 so that it appears as an open in the top part of the totem pole.
A diode between the two totem-pole transistors provides an extra voltage drop in series with the base-emitter
junction of Q4 to ensure that Q4 will be turned off when Q2 is turned on. The saturated Q3 transistor brings
the output near ground potential, producing a low output result for a high input into the inverter.
