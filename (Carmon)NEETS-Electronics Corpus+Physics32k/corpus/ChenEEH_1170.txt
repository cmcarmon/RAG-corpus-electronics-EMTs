Serious on-chip electrical problems are being encountered
in deep submicron (DSM). These problems include signal
distortion along coupled interconnect lines, voltage variations
in the power supply distribution, substrate coupling, charge
sharing, charge leakage, process variation, thermal noise, and
alpha particles. Each one is a major source of on-chip noise in
VLSI circuits.
