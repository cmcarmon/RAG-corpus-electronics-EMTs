The voltage v is zero for all t < 0, and is 1 volt for 0 < t < 2. What is v during the
interval from t = 2 to t = 5? Show one simple possibility for the circuit in the box.
p r o b l e m 10.10 As illustrated in Figure 10.110, a capacitor and resistor can be
used to filter or smooth the waveforms we derived from a half-wave rectifier, to get
something closer to a DC voltage at the output, for use in a power supply, for example.
