As with diodes, the ohmmeter terminal  voltage 
must never exceed the maximum voltage 
 rating between the junctions of a transistor. The 
lower scales of some ohmmeters can supply a 
 damaging current to the transistor under test. As a 
 precautionary measure, it is best to start out at the 
safest range and then change to a scale that gives 
an adequate reading.
