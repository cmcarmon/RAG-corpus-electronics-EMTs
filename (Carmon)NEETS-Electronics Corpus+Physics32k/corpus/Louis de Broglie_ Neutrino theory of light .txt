This theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two Dirac neutrinos.
It shows that the movement of the center of gravity of these two particles obeys the Maxwell equationsâ€”that implies that the neutrino and the photon both have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low.
