p r o b l e m 9.3 A current source drives a series-connected capacitor and inductor
as shown in Figure 9.64. Let I(t) = I◦ sin(ωt)u(t), and assume that the inductor and
capacitor both stored no energy prior to t = 0.
Determine the voltage v for t ≥ 0.
Is there any relation between I◦, ω, C, and L for which v is constant for t ≥ 0? If so,
state the relation and determine v.
p r o b l e m 9.4 A voltage source drives a parallel-connected capacitor and induc-
tor as shown in Figure 9.65. Let V(t) = V◦ sin(ωt)u(t), and assume that the inductor and
capacitor both stored no energy prior to t = 0.
Determine the current i for t ≥ 0.
Is there any relation between V◦, ω, C, and L for which i is constant for t ≥ 0? If so,
state the relation and determine i.
