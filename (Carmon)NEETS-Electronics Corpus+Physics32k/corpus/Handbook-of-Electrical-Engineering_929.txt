Process simulation is always done in the transient mode using time steps as was done with transient circuit
simulation.  Because  partial  differential  equations  are  involved,  rather  than  ordinary  differential  equations,
spatial  discretization  is  needed  as  well.  To  numerically  solve  the  problem,  the  differential  equations  are  dis-
cretized on a grid. Either rectangular or triangular grids in one, two, or three dimensions are commonly used.
This discretization process results in the conversion of the partial differential equations into a set of nonlinear
algebraic equations. The nonlinear equations are then solved using a Newton method in a way very similar to
the method used for the circuit equations in SPICE.
