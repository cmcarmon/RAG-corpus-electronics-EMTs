Atomic clocks are very precise and have nearly no clock drift. Even the Earth's rotation rate has more drift and variation in drift than an atomic clock due to tidal acceleration and other effects. The principle behind the atomic clock has enabled scientists to re-define the SI unit second in terms of exactly 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the caesium atom. The precision of these oscillations allows atomic clocks to drift roughly only one second in a hundred million years; currently, the most accurate of which loses one second every 15 billion years. The International Atomic Time (TAI) time standard and its derivatives (such as the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)) are based on weighted averages of atomic clocks worldwide.
