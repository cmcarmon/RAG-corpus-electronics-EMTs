There are many quantum field theories which, while not being exactly scale invariant, remain approximately scale invariant over a long range of distances. Such quantum field theories can be obtained by adding to free field theories interaction terms with small dimensionless couplings. For example, in four spacetime dimensions one can add quartic scalar couplings, Yukawa couplings, or gauge couplings. Scaling dimensions of operators in such theories can be expressed schematically as



Δ
=

Δ

0


+
γ
(
g
)


{\displaystyle \Delta =\Delta _{0}+\gamma (g)}
, where




Δ

0




{\displaystyle \Delta _{0}}
is the dimension when all couplings are set to zero (i.e. the classical dimension), while



γ
(
g
)


{\displaystyle \gamma (g)}
is called the anomalous dimension, and is expressed as a power series in the couplings collectively denoted as



g


{\displaystyle g}
. Such a separation of scaling dimensions into the classical and anomalous part is only meaningful when couplings are small, so that



γ
(
g
)


{\displaystyle \gamma (g)}
is a small correction.
Generally, due to quantum mechanical effects, the couplings



g


{\displaystyle g}
do not remain constant, but vary (in the jargon of quantum field theory, run) with the distance scale according to their beta-function. Therefore the anomalous dimension



γ
(
g
)


{\displaystyle \gamma (g)}
also depends on the distance scale in such theories. In particular correlation functions of local operators are no longer simple powers but have a more complicated dependence on the distances, generally with logarithmic corrections.
It may happen that the evolution of the couplings will lead to a value



g
=

g

∗




{\displaystyle g=g_{*}}
where the beta-function vanishes. Then at long distances the theory becomes scale invariant, and the anomalous dimensions stop running. Such a behavior is called an infrared fixed point.
In very special cases, it may happen when the couplings and the anomalous dimensions do not run at all, so that the theory is scale invariant at all distances and for any value of the coupling. For example, this occurs in the N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
