a	verbal	descriptions	since	they	may	be	less	complicated	to	understand.	Especially
if	the	particular	circuit	is	quite	advanced,	a	description	containing	words	can	be
challenging	to	use	as	basis.	If	a	visual	model	is	employed,	however,	you	can
simply	focus	on	connections,	instead	of	the	interpretation	of	a	worded	description;
there	is	a	better	chance	of	building	an	impressive	circuit	design	successfully.
Especially	if	you	have	plans	of	advancing	your	place	in	circuit	engineering	by
soon	moving	forward	from	a	novice	to	a	circuit	expert,	memorizing	the	different
circuit	symbols	is	a	must.
