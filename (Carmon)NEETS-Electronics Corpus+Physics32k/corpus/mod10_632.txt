Look at view A of figure 4-10. The numbered positions around the circle are laid out on the 
HORIZONTAL AXIS of the graph from 0 to 7 units. The measured radiation is laid out on the 
VERTICAL AXIS of the graph from 0 to 10 units. The units on both axes are chosen so the pattern 
occupies a convenient part of the graph.
