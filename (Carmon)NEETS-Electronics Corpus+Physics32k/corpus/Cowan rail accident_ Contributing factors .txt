Contributing factors include:
AC track circuits, which are less sensitive at detecting rail vehicles.
Sand on the rails insulated the train's wheels and prevented the track circuit from detecting it - the train effectively became invisible to the signalling system.
The signalling system was two-aspect colour light - a three aspect colour light may have provided the driver of the following train with more warning.
No sand removal system fitted to 3801.
No mechanism (at the time) for train-to-train or train-to-signalman communication (communication with signal boxes was only possible by track-side phones).
It is believed that the handbrakes on one of the carriages may have been applied as a stunt.
