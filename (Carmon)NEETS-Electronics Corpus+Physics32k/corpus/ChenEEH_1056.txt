because of
these timing elements are
extensively used in almost all digital systems where many
storage units and pipelining are used. Second,
it is well
known that a signiÔ¨Åcant fraction of the system power is dissi-
pated in the clock distribution network that drives all timing
elements. Consequently, the design of low-power sequential
