View (B) illustrates a simpler method of representation. In this method, the length of the arrow is 
proportional to the magnitude of force, and the direction of force is indicated by the direction of the 
arrow. Thus, if an arrow 1-inch long represents 50 pounds of force, then an arrow 2-inches long would 
represent 100 pounds of force. This method of showing both magnitude and direction is called a 
VECTOR. To more clearly show the relationships between the amplitude, phase, and frequency of a sine 
wave, we will use vectors.
