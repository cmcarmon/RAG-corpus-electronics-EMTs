The basic design of a satellite communications system depends to a great degree upon the 
characteristics of the orbit of the satellite. In general terms, an orbit is either elliptical or circular in shape. 
A special type of orbit is a SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT. In this type you will find the period (time required 
for one revolution) of the orbit the same as that of the earth. An orbit that is not synchronous is called 
ASYNCHRONOUS. A period of orbit that approaches that of the earth is called NEAR 
SYNCHRONOUS (subsynchronous). Orbits are discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
