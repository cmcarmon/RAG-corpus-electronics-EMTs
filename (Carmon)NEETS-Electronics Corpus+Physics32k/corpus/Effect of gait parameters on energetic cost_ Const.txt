Since multiple distinct gait parameters have a significant impact on the energetic cost of walking, each of these parameters have to be considered when examining the primary goal of metabolic cost optimization. The visualization of such an optimization for walking speed, cadence, and step length can be expressed in the form of a contour map, in which parameter combinations that lie on the same contour line share the same cost of transport (cal/kg/m). The green, red, and blue, dotted lines represent values where cadence, walking speed, and step length are constrained, respectively. These lines can be formed by finding the tangent points that lines representative of several constant parameter values form with the constant COT contours. For example, the optimal COT's for constrained walking speeds (red) can be found by drawing vertical lines and noting where they form a tangent with a contour, as seen with point B in the diagram. A series of these intersections can then form the curve for optimal COT under constrained walking speed. These constrained optimization values not only reflect the naturally selected preferred gait parameters that are observed by fixing a single parameter at different values, but also form part of a predictive map that allows for the identification of the cost of transport for a multivariate system.
