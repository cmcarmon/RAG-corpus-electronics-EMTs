One further comment: If in the problem statement we had been asked to find one of the
resistor currents, say i3, rather than iD, then the Thévenin circuit, Figure 4.13e, would
not give this current directly, because the identity of currents internal to the Thévenin
network are in general lost, as noted in Chapter 3. Nonetheless, the Thévenin approach
is probably the best, as it is a simple matter to work back through the linear part of
the network to relate i3 to iD. In this case, once we have computed iD, we can easily
determine i3 from Figure 4.13a using KCL,
