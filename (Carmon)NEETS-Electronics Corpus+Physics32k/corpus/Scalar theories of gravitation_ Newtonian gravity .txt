The prototypical scalar theory of gravitation is Newtonian gravitation. In this theory, the gravitational interaction is completely described by the potential



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }
, which is required to satisfy the Poisson equation (with the mass density acting as the source of the field). To wit:

{\displaystyle \Delta \Phi =4\pi G\rho }
, where
G is the gravitational constant and




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density.
This field theory formulation leads directly to the familiar law of universal gravitation,
