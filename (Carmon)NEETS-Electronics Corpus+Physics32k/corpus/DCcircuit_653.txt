The electrons, having much less mass than metal plates, are moved by this electrostatic
force very quickly and readily. Their deﬂected path can be traced as the electrons impinge on
the glass end of the tube where they strike a coating of phosphorus chemical, emitting a glow
of light seen outside of the tube. The greater the voltage between the deﬂection plates, the
