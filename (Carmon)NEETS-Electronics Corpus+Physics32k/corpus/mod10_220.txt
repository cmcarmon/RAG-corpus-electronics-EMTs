Initially, you can consider that the generator output is zero and that no fields exist about the antenna, 
as shown in view A. Now assume that the generator produces a slight potential and has the instantaneous 
polarity shown in view B. Because of this slight potential, the antenna capacitance acts as a short, 
allowing a large flow of current (I) through the antenna in the direction shown. This current flow, in turn, 
produces a large magnetic field about the antenna. Since the flow of current at each end of the antenna is 
minimum, the corresponding magnetic fields at each end of the antenna are also minimum. As time 
passes, charges, which oppose antenna current and produce an electrostatic field (E field), collect at each 
end of the antenna. Eventually, the antenna capacitance becomes fully charged and stops current flow 
through the antenna. Under this condition, the electrostatic field is maximum, and the magnetic field (H 
field) is fully collapsed, as shown in view C.
