Note that in one step we have one unknown and one equation, whereas by
the KVL and KCL method of Chapter 2 we would have written eight equations
in eight unknowns. Further, note that both the device law for every resistor and
all independent statements of KVL for the circuit have been used in writing
Equation 3.5.
