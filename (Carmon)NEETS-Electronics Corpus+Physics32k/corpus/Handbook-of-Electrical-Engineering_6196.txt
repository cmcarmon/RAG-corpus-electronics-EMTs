By 1912, radio technology had attracted a small number of dedicated individuals who identiﬁed their
own future with the progress of their chosen ﬁeld. Some of these had organized themselves into small,
localized societies, but it was clear to many that a broader vision was needed if radio practitioners were
to achieve the recognition and respect of technical professionals. It was with such a vision in mind that
representatives of two of these local societies met in New York City in May 1912 to form the Institute of
Radio  Engineers.  The  IRE  was  to  be  an  international  society  dedicated  to  the  highest  professional
standards and to the advancement of the theory and practice of radio technology.
