In 1932, Fritz Höppler was granted a patent for the Falling ball viscometer, named after him - the worldwide first viscometer to determine the dynamic viscosity. More other world-firsts viscometers which were developed by Fritz Höppler in Medingen (Germany) are the Ball Pressure types Consistometer and Rheoviscometer, see Kugeldruckviskosimeter = Ball Pressure Viscometer.
