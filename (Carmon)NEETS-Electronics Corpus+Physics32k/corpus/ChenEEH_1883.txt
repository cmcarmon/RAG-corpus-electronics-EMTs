mission-critical systems (e.g., avionics, space-mission systems).
Simultaneously, the complexity of these computer and digital
systems are increasing every few months, and the electronic
components (transistors and wires) used to design them are
reducing in feature sizes dramatically over the same span. Cur-
rent feature sizes have reached 90 nanometers, and further de-
creases are anticipated. Simultaneously, signiﬁcant efforts are
being undertaken in research on nanoelectronics, which will
take feature sizes to the next level of compaction: nanometers.
Voltage levels for these systems have also dropped signiﬁcantly
from the classical 5 V to its current levels of 1.1 Vand lower. These
developments augur well for more complex and faster processing
on very large-scale integrated (VLSI) chips.
