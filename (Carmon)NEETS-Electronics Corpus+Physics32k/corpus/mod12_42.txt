In 1897 Marconi demonstrated the first practical wireless transmitter. He sent and received messages 
over a distance of 8 miles. By 1898 he had demonstrated the usefulness of wireless telegraph 
communications at sea. In 1899 he established a wireless telegraphic link across the English Channel. His 
company also established general usage of the wireless telegraph between coastal light ships (floating 
lighthouses) and land. The first successful transatlantic transmissions were achieved in 1902. From that 
time to the present, radio communication has grown at an extraordinary rate. Early systems transmitted a 
few words per minute with doubtful reliability. Today, communications systems reliably transmit 
information across millions of miles.
