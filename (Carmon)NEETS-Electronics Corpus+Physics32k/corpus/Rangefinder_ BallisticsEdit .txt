Rangefinders may be used by users of firearms over long distances, to measure the distance to a target in order to allow for projectile drop. The laser rangefinder displays a luminous dot that may alert a target. Until the development of electronic means of measuring range during the Second World War, warships used very large optical rangefinders—with a baseline of many meters—to measure range for naval gunnery.
