We have presented a summary of various fault-detection and
fault-tolerance methods at various levels of a computing
system: arithmetic circuit, FPGA, program control ﬂow, pro-
cessor system and algorithm. We have also presented some of
our works in these areas. Results show that the techniques
discussed produce signiﬁcant increases in system reliability.
As computer chips become more complex and denser, with
smaller devices, they and systems incorporating them become
more and more vulnerable to faults arising from a myriad of
sources like fabrication errors, operation extremes, and exter-
nal disturbances. Computer systems are also being increasingly
used in various economic- and life-critical environments. It is
thus hoped that microprocessor and computer manufacturing
will undergo a paradigm shift whereby reliability becomes an
important metric, and fault tolerance capabilities of different
degrees such as those discussed here are explicitly designed in
computer chips and systems to provide different levels of
dependability and reliability needed in various application
environments.
