In  building  an  acoustic  decision  tree  using  phonetic  context,  at  least  10  variables  may  be  interrogated,  5
preceding phones and 5 following phones. Since all of these variables belong to the same phonetic alphabet,
only one set of questions needs to be prepared, where each question is a subset of the phonetic alphabet.
