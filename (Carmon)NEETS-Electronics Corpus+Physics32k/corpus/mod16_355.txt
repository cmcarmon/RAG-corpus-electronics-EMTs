When voltmeters are used, a primary rule of safety is that such voltage-measuring instruments must
always be connected  in parallel with (across) a circuit. If you are unsure of the level of the voltage to be
measured, take a reading at the highest range of the voltmeter and progressively (step by step) lower the
range until a suitable reading is obtained. In many cases, the voltmeter you will be using will not be a
