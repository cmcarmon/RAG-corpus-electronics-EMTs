This is a metric often used in computer vision that can be minimized by least squares estimation. [1][2] For curves or surfaces given by the equation

{\displaystyle x^{\text{T}}Cx=0}
(such as a conic in homogeneous coordinates), the algebraic distance from the point

{\displaystyle x'}
to the curve is simply

. It may serve as an "initial guess" for geometric distance to refine estimations of the curve by more accurate methods, such as non-linear least squares.
