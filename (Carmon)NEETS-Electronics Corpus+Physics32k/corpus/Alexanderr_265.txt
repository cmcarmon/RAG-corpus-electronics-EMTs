Input V1 is called the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB), while input V4 is the
least signiﬁcant bit (LSB). Each of the four binary inputs V1, . . . , V4
can assume only two voltage levels: 0 or 1 V. By using the proper input
and feedback resistor values, the DAC provides a single output that is
proportional to the inputs.
