When the CT rotor is rotated 90ยบ, as shown in figure 1-26, the rotor is parallel to the resultant stator 
field Maximum magnetic coupling occurs between the rotor and stator fields at this point. As a result of 
this coupling, the stator windings induce a maximum of 55 volts into the rotor winding. The phase of this 
voltage depends upon the direction in which the CT rotor is turned. The rotor of the CT is wound so that 
clockwise rotation of the stator magnetic field induces a voltage across the rotor which is proportional to 
the amount of rotation and in phase with the ac supply voltage. Counterclockwise rotation of the stator 
magnetic field produces a voltage that is still proportional to the amount of rotation, but 180ยบ out of phase 
with the supply voltage. Keep in mind that the clockwise rotation of the CT stator magnetic field is the 
same as the counterclockwise rotation of the CT rotor. This phase relationship between the ac supply 
voltage and the CT output voltage becomes more apparent in figure 1-27.
