Bipolar transistors work in a similar way: The base acts like the controllable 
valve in Figure 10-5, controlling the flow of electrons from the emitter to the 
collector (or, in circuit‚Äêspeak, the flow of conventional current from the col-
lector to the emitter). By controlling the base, you can turn the transistor 
fully on or fully off, or you can allow small changes at the base to control 
large changes in current from collector to emitter.
