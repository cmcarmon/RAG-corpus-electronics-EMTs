To perform CFC, the source code to be executed by the
checked system is preprocessed: the CFG is extracted, signa-
tures are assigned to the nodes (blocks), the blocks are aug-
mented with these signatures, and possibly the program of the
main processor is modiÔ¨Åed by inserting the statements that
transfer the signatures to the WD.
