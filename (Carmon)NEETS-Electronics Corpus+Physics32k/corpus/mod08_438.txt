When the saturable-core reactor is set at the knee of the magnetization curve, any small increase in
control current will cause a large increase in load current. Any small decrease in control current will cause
a large decrease in load current. That is why point "O" is the ideal operating point-because small changes
in control current will cause large changes in load current. In other words, the saturable-core reactor can
amplify the control current. However, a saturable-core reactor is NOT a magnetic amplifier. You will find
out a little later how a magnetic amplifier differs from a saturable-core reactor. First you should know a
few more things about the saturable-core reactor.
