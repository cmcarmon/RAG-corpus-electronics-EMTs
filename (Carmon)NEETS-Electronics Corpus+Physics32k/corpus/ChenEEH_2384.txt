The far-ﬁeld region may be loosely deﬁned to be sufﬁciently far
away from the antenna (i.e., r ! 1). In this region, the
radiating ﬁelds behave like a uniform plane wave, having no
ﬁeld component along the radial direction (^rr). Using the basic
principles of a plane wave (Cheng, 1993; Rao, 2000; Ramo
et al., 1993), one can relate the magnetic ﬁeld HH in the far-
ﬁeld region to the corresponding electric ﬁeld EE in a quite
simple manner, as given in equation 6.4. Therefore, it may be
convenient and sufﬁcient to use only the electric ﬁeld EE to
model various far-ﬁeld antenna parameters.
