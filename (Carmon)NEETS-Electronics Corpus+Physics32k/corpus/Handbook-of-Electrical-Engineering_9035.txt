Compensation must be provided for both aerodynamic and electrostatic interactions. Two primary examples
are that (1) the ﬁrst drop in a sequence of drops encounters much greater aerodynamic drag than subsequent
drops, and (2) the charge on a drop is inﬂuenced by the charge on the previous few drops. One approach to
greatly  reduce  electrostatic  drop  interaction  and  to  stabilize  merging  effects  is  to  include  noncharged  drops
between charged drops. This obviously reduces the effective drop rate by a factor of two and requires a design
conﬁguration  where  only  charged  drops  reach  the  paper.  Charging  electrode  voltage  adjustment  algorithms
based on voltages applied to prior drops are also used to reduce the electrostatic interaction.
