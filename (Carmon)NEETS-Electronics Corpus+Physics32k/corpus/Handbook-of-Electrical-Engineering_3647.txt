The  last  two  equations  relate,  respectively,  the  electric  polarization  P  to  the  displacement  D  =  e
oE  and  the
magnetic moment M to the ﬂux density B = moH. They apply only to “linear” materials, i.e., those for which
P is linearly related to E and M to H. For magnetic materials we can say that nonlinear materials are usually
of greater practical interest.
