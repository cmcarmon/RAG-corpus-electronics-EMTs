1. Even though it’s not, pretend the source is a complex exponential. We do this because the impedance
approach simpliﬁes ﬁnding how input and output are related. If it were a voltage source having voltage
vin = p (t) (a pulse), still let vin = Vinej2πf t. We’ll learn how to “get the pulse back” later.
