Television Reception
The broadcast channels in the United States are 6 MHz wide for transmission on conventional 525-line stan-
dards. The minimum signal level at which a television receiver will provide usable pictures and sound is called
the sensitivity level. The FCC has set up two standard signal level classiÔ¨Åcations, Grades A and B, for the purpose
of licensing television stations and allocating coverage areas. Grade A refers to urban areas relatively near the
transmitting tower; Grade B use ranges from suburban to rural and other fringe areas a number of miles from
the transmitting antenna.
