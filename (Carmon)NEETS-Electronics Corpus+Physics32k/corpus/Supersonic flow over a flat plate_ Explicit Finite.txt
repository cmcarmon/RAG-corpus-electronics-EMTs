This method involves using time-dependent Navier-Stokes equation which is advantageous because of its inherent ability to evolve to the correct steady state solution. The continuity, momentum and energy equations and some other situational equations are needed to solve the problem. MacCormackâ€™s time marching technique is applied and then using Taylor series expansion the flow field variables are advanced at each grid point. Then, initial boundary conditions are applied and solving equations will converge to approximated results. These equations can be solved by using different algorithms to get better and efficient results with minimum errors.
