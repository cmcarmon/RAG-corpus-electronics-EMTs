Since the goal of defect removal is the elimination of bugs or defects, the primary ﬁgure of merit for a defect
 is deﬁned as the percent of latent
removal operation is its 
defects which a given removal operation will detect. Cumulative defect removal efﬁciency is the overall efﬁciency
of a complete series of pre-test removal activities combined with all test stages.
