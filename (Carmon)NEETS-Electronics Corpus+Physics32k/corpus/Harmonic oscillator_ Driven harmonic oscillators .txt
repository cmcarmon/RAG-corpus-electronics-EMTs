Driven harmonic oscillators are damped oscillators further affected by an externally applied force F(t).
Newton's second law takes the form

{\displaystyle F(t)-kx-c{\frac {\mathrm {d} x}{\mathrm {d} t}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}x}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}.}

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}x}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}+2\zeta \omega _{0}{\frac {\mathrm {d} x}{\mathrm {d} t}}+\omega _{0}^{2}x={\frac {F(t)}{m}}.}

This equation can be solved exactly for any driving force, using the solutions z(t) which satisfy the unforced equation:
