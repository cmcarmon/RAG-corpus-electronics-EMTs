and  B  when  all  of  the  voltage  sources  (assumed 
perfect)  are  replaced  by  short-circuit  connections. 
Note that if the voltage sources are not perfect (i.e. 
if they have some internal resistance) the equivalent 
circuit  must  be  constructed  on  the  basis  that  each 
voltage  source  is  replaced  by  its  own  internal 
resistance. 
  Once  we  have  values  for  Voc  and  R, we  can 
determine how the network will behave when it is 
connected  to  a  load  (i.e.  when  a  resistor  is 
connected across the terminals A and B). 
 
Example 3.7 
 
Figure 3.16 shows a Wheatstone bridge. Determine 
the current that will flow in a 100 F load connected  
between terminals A and B. 
 
Solution 
 
First we need to find the Th√©venin equivalent of the 
circuit.  To  find  Voc  we  can  treat  the  bridge 
arrangement as two potential dividers.  
  The voltage across R2 will be given by:
