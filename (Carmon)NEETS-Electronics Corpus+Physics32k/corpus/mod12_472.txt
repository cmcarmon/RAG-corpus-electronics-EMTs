The waveforms for the circuit are shown in figure 3-18. View (A) is the fm input signal. The
limiter-grid gate action creates a wave shape like view (B) because the tube is either cut off or saturated
very quickly by the input wave. Note that this is a square wave and is the current waveform passing the
limiter grid.
