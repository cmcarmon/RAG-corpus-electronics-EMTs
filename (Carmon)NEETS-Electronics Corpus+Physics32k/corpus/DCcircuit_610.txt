Also shown at the end of the series and parallel circuits chapter was how the table method
works just as well for aiding failure analysis as it does for the analysis of healthy circuits.
We may take this technique one step further and adapt it for total qualitative analysis. By
”qualitative” I mean working with symbols representing ”increase,” ”decrease,” and ”same”
instead of precise numerical ﬁgures. We can still use the principles of series and parallel
circuits, and the concepts of Ohm’s Law, we’ll just use symbolic qualities instead of numerical
quantities. By doing this, we can gain more of an intuitive ”feel” for how circuits work rather
than leaning on abstract equations, attaining Dirac’s deﬁnition of ”understanding.”
