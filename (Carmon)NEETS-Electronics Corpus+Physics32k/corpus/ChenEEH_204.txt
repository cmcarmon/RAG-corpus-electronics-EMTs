between a circuit’s voltages or currents. The nonlinear relation-
ships between circuit variables stem from the elements’ consti-
tutive relationships. As a result, the equations governing the
behavior of a nonlinear circuit are nonlinear. In cases where a
direct current response of the circuit is sought, the governing
equations are nonlinear algebraic equations. In cases where
transient behavior of a circuit is examined, the governing equa-
tions are nonlinear differential-algebraic equations.
