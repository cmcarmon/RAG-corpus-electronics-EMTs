It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is vari-
able (usually called the load) while other elements are ﬁxed. As a typ-
ical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to different
appliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable element
is changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid
this  problem,  Thevenin’s  theorem  provides  a  technique  by  which  the
ﬁxed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.
