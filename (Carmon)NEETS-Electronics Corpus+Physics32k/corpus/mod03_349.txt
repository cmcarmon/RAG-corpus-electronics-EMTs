A voltmeter can also be used to check for an open fuse. The measurement is taken between each end
of the fuse and the common or ground side of the line. If voltage is present on both sides of the fuse (from
the voltage source and to the load), the fuse is not open. Another method commonly used, is to measure
across the fuse with the voltmeter. If NO voltage is indicated on the meter, the fuse is good, (not open).
