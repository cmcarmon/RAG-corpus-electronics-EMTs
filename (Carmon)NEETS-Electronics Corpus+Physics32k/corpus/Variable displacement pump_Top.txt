A variable displacement pump is a device that converts mechanical energy to hydraulic (fluid) energy. The displacement, or amount of fluid pumped per revolution of the pump's input shaft can be varied while the pump is running.
Many variable displacement pumps are "reversible", meaning that they can act as a hydraulic motor and convert fluid energy into mechanical energy.
