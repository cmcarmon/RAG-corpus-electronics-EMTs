As a Ô¨Ånal point, because both node and mesh analysis will yield all currents and voltages in a network, which
technique should be used? The answer to this question depends upon the network to be analyzed. If the network
contains more voltage sources than current sources, node analysis might be the easier technique. If, however,
the network contains more current sources than voltage sources, mesh analysis may be the easiest approach.
