The subject of this chapter is electric ﬁelds (and devices called capacitors that exploit them),
not magnetic ﬁelds, but there are many similarities. Most likely you have experienced electric
ﬁelds as well. Chapter 1 of this book began with an explanation of static electricity, and how
materials such as wax and wool – when rubbed against each other – produced a physical attrac-
tion. Again, physicists would describe this interaction in terms of electric ﬁelds generated by
the two objects as a result of their electron imbalances. Sufﬁce it to say that whenever a volt-
age exists between two points, there will be an electric ﬁeld manifested in the space between
those points.
