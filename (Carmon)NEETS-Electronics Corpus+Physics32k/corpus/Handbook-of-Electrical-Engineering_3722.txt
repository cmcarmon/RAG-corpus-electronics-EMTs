where  Na  and  Nb  are  the  demagnetizing  factors  in  the  directions  transverse  and  parallel  to  the  particle  axis,
respectively. In practice the coercivity is measured to be less than this. This has been explained as being a result
of the fact the magnetization does not remain uniform during the switching process, but switches inhomoge-
neously [White, 1984]. In addition to the effects which the shape anisotropy of the particles has on the coercivity,
crystalline anisotropy can also be used to control coercivity.
