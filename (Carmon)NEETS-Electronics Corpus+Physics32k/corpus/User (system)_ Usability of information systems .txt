The problem with designing a new system is always the level of knowledge that is required from a system user to understand how to interact with an interface and, therefore gain increase in productivity of the task that the system is focused on. Many famous systems nowadays use alpha-beta-release scheme of testing the system on approachability to an end user, alpha is the first testing procedures that most software company use, it involves providing access to a small group of people with certain knowledge in order to test the most important features, then the system shifts to a beta phase where the access is gained to the public interested to test the features of the system and by giving access to a much bigger pool of testers system designers make sure that the system is tested under every possible condition for an every given feature, after the system is released to everyone else who is interested. However, since 20th century when the first basic systems were introduced many users had to study a lot about in order to be efficient at the interaction between operators and the system itself.
