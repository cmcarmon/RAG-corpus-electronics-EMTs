A Modern Example System
The B-777 Airplane Information Management System (AIMS) is the Ô¨Årst civil transport aircraft application of
the integrated, modular avionics concept, similar to that being used in the U.S. Air Force F-22. Figure 102.1
shows the AIMS cabinet with eight modules installed and three spaces for additional modules to be added as
the AIMS functions are expanded. Figure 102.2 shows the AIMS architecture.
