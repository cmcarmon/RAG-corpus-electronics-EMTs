4.8
In many practical situations, a circuit is designed to provide power to
a load. There are applications in areas such as communications where
it  is  desirable  to  maximize  the  power  delivered  to  a  load.  We  now
address the problem of delivering the maximum power to a load when
given a system with known internal losses. It should be noted that this
will  result  in  signiÔ¨Åcant  internal  losses  greater  than  or  equal  to  the
power delivered to the load.
