The ac double substrate device shown on the left of Fig. 83.30 has a structure very similar to the monochrome
device of Fig. 83.28 [Doyeux and Deschamps, 1995]. The major differences are the introduction of glass barrier
ribs  to  maintain  color  purity  and  the  introduction  of  color  phosphors.  The  phosphors  are  placed  on  one
substrate and are carefully positioned to avoid the location directly over the electrode since the sputtering action
over the electrode will cause signiÔ¨Åcant phosphor degradation.
