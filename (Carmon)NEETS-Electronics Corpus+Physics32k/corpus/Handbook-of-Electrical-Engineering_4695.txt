A distributive reﬂective array is typically composed of a series of shorted metal electrodes, etched grooves
in  the  substrate,  or  dielectric  strips.  There  is  a  physical  discontinuity  on  the  substrate  surface  due  to  the
individual reﬂectors. Each reﬂector is one-quarter wavelength wide and the periodicity of the array is one-half
wavelength. This is shown schematically in Fig. 47.14. The net reﬂections from all the individual array elements
add  synchronously  at  center  frequency,  resulting  in  a  very  efﬁcient  reﬂector.  The  reﬂection  from  each  array
element is small and very little spurious mode coupling results.
