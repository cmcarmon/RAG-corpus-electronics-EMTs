gradual because of the counter emf generated by the self-inductance of the coil. When the current starts to 
flow, the magnetic lines of force move outward from the coil. These lines cut the turns of wire on the 
inductor and build up a counter emf that opposes the emf of the battery. This opposition causes a delay in 
the time it takes the current to build up to a steady value. When the battery is disconnected, the lines of 
force collapse. Again these lines cut the turns of the inductor and build up an emf that tends to prolong the 
flow of current.
