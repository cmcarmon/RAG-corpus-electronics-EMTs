Certain applications in electronics require that the upper or lower extremity of a wave be fixed at a 
specific value. In such applications, a CLAMPING (or CLAMPER) circuit is used. A clamping circuit 
clamps or restrains either the upper or lower extremity of a waveform to a fixed dc potential. This circuit 
is also known as a DIRECT-CURRENT RESTORER or a BASE-LINE STABILIZER. Such circuits are 
used in test equipment, radar systems, electronic countermeasure systems, and sonar systems. Depending 
upon the equipment, you could find negative or positive clampers with or without bias. Figure 4-16, 
views (A) through (E), illustrates some examples of waveforms created by clampers. However, before we 
discuss clampers, we will review some relevant points about series RC circuits.
