Most IF ampliﬁers have high gains and gain control. The
automatic gain control (AGC) is to hold the amplitude at the
output of the receiver constant. Multichannel tracking re-
ceivers should have the same gain control voltage applied to
all receivers, and they must maintain the same gain over their
gain control range (90 dB or more). Maintaining identical
gains in multiple channels over wide gain-control excursions
is called gain tracking.
