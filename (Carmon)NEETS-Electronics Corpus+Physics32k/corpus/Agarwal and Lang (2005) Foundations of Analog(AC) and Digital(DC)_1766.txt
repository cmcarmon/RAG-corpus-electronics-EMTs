Figure 12.32 shows vC and iL as given by Equations 12.157 and 12.158. Notice that the
oscillations in both states do not decay and continue indefinitely because there are no
resistors in the circuit to damp their response. Similarly, here, vC undergoes a two-fold
overshoot. However, the average value of vC is Vâ—¦.
