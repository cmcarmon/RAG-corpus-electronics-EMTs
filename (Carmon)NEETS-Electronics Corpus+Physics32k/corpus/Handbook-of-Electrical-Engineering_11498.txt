HCFA (e.g., UCDS, WARP, UHDDS)
UCDS provides an electronic clinical data set that Medicare can use to perform clinical quality reviews. The
quality evaluation is done by using algorithms related to surgical procedures, disease speciﬁc, organ speciﬁc,
discharge status and disposition, etc. The UCDS permits the hospital to enter the data into a personal computer;
then this information can be sent electronically to the HCFA. WARP provides an epidemiologic approach to
quality assurance. It hopes to overcome about 50% of ICD miscoding and its initial focus is on ambulatory
chart  review  rather  than  real-time  patient  care.  It  is  not  a  diagnostic  or  procedural  classiﬁcation  system.  It
basically provides a model for encoding clinical information. It is an object-oriented case tool. UHDDS was
created for studies on quality of care and fraud. It is also used for auditing Medicare and Medicaid subsystems.
