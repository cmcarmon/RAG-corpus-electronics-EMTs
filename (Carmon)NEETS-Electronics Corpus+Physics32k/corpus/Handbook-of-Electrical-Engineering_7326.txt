The  development  of  large-scale  integrated  circuits  over  the  past  several  years  has  made  the  design  and
implementation  of  PLLs  and  frequency  synthesizers  much  cheaper  and  easier.  Several  major  manufacturers
(Motorola, Signetics, National, Plessey, etc.) currently supply a wide range of components for PLL implemen-
tation. The most complex of these are the synthesizer circuits that provide a programmable reference divider,
 and a phase detector. Several conÔ¨Ågurations of these circuits are available to suit
programmable divide by 
most applications. Integrated circuits are also available to implement most of the individual blocks shown in
Fig. 76.1.
