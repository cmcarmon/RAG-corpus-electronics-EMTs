The ratio of varactor capacitance to reverse-bias voltage change may be as high as 10 to 1. Figure 
3-15 shows one example of the voltage-to-capacitance ratio. View A shows that a reverse bias of 3 volts 
produces a capacitance of 20 picofarads in the varactor. If the reverse bias is increased to 6 volts, as 
shown in view B, the depletion region widens and capacitance drops to 5 picofarads. Each 1-volt increase 
in bias voltage causes a 5-picofarad decrease in the capacitance of the varactor; the ratio of change is 
therefore 5 to 1. Of course any decrease in applied bias voltage would cause a proportionate increase in 
capacitance, as the depletion region narrows. Notice that the value of the capacitance is small in the 
picofarad range.
