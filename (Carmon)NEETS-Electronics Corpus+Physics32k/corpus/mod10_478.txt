A plot of these new voltages produces the solid curve shown in figure 3-22, view B. For reference,
the curve from T7 is drawn as a dotted line. The solid curve has exactly the same shape as the dotted
curve, but has moved to the right by the distance X. Another plot at T9 would show a new curve similar
to the one at T8, but moved to the right by the distance Y.
