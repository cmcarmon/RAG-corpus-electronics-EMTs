1. All capacitors are removed from the circuit (replaced with opens).
2. All inductors are replaced with shorts.
3. Modiﬁed nodal analysis is used to construct the nonlinear circuit equations. This results in one equation
for each circuit node plus one equation for each voltage source. Modiﬁed nodal analysis is used rather
than standard nodal analysis because an ideal voltage source or inductance cannot be represented using
normal nodal analysis. To represent the voltage sources, loop equations (one for each voltage source or
inductor), are included as well as the standard node equations. The node voltages and voltage source

. The circuit equations
currents, then, represent the quantities which are solved for. These form a vector
