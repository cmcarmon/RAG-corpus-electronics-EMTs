The internal workings of an ampliﬁer are too complex to be discussed at this point, but suf-
ﬁce it to say that the circuit allows the measured voltage to control how much battery current
is sent to the meter movement. Thus, the movement’s current needs are supplied by a battery
internal to the voltmeter and not by the circuit under test. The ampliﬁer still loads the circuit
under test to some degree, but generally hundreds or thousands of times less than the meter
movement would by itself.
