Double-Ended PWM Converters. Usually, for power levels above 300 W, double-ended converters are used.
In  double-ended  converters,  full-wave  rectiﬁers  are  used  and  the  output  voltage  ripple  will  have  twice  the
switching frequency. Three important double-ended PWM converter conﬁgurations are push-pull (Fig. 30.25),
half-bridge (Fig. 30.26), and full-bridge (Fig. 30.27).
