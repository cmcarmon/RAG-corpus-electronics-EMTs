In classical mechanics, instantaneous power is the limiting value of the average work done per unit time as the time interval Δt approaches zero.

The typically used metrical unit of the power-to-weight ratio is

g







{\displaystyle {\tfrac {W}{kg}}\;}
which equals

s

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {m^{2}}{s^{3}}}\;}
. This fact allows one to express the power-to-weight ratio purely by SI base units.
