Nielsen and Ninomiya proved a theorem stating that a local, real, free fermion lattice action, having chiral and translational invariance, necessarily has fermion doubling. The only way to get rid of the doublers is by violating one of the presuppositions of the theorem —for example:
Wilson fermions explicitly violate chiral symmetry, giving an infinitely high mass to the doublers which then decouple.
So-called "perfect lattice fermions" have a nonlocal action.
