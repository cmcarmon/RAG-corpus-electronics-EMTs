An analogous derivation to that in Section 3.6.1 gives rise to the Norton equiv-
alent network. Recall that our goal is to find the v i relation for the network in
Figure 3.75a so that we can replace the network with a simple equivalent circuit
that yields the same v i relation as the original network. To find the v i relation-
ship, this time we apply a test voltage vtest to the circuit, as in Figure 3.75b, and
find the resultant current it. Using superposition, the two subcircuits needed
to find it are shown in Figure 3.75c and 3.75d. In 3.75c, vtest is set to zero
and we measure ia. In 3.75d, all independent sources are set to zero and we
measure ib. Then,
