Before using an analog meter, the pointer should be 
adjusted to 0. A small screw is located on the front of 
the meter to permit this adjustment (Figure 15-3). To 
zero the meter, place the meter in the position where 
it is to be used. If the needle does not point to 0, use a 
screwdriver to turn the screw until it does. The meter 
should not be connected to a circuit while this adjust-
ment is being made.
