In larger transmitters, some local low-voltage supply, such as a battery, is used with the hand key to 
open and close a circuit through the coils of a KEYING RELAY. The relay contacts open and close the 
keying circuit of the amplifier. A schematic diagram of a typical relay-operated keying system is shown 
in figure 1-25. The hand key closes the circuit from the low-voltage supply through the coil (L) of the 
keying relay. The relay armature closes the relay contacts as a result of the magnetic pull exerted on the 
armature. The armature moves against the tension of a spring. When the hand key is opened, the relay coil 
is deenergized and the spring opens the relay contacts.
