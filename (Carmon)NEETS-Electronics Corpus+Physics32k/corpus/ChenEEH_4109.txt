The baseband data rates of a wireless transmitter are usually a
few kilobits per second [kbps] to as high as several hundred
kilobits. The wavelengths for those signals vary from a thou-
sand meters to several hundred thousand meters. If we at-
tempted to send these signals directly, the antennas would
be very long, and multiple transmitters would interfere with
each other.
