The polar moment of inertia is insufficient for use to analyze beams and shafts with non-circular cross-sections, due their tendency to warp when twisted, causing out-of-plane deformations. In such cases, a torsion constant should be substituted, where an appropriate deformation constant is included to compensate for the warping effect. Within this, there are articles that differentiate between the polar moment of inertia,




I

z




{\displaystyle I_{z}}
, and the torsional constant,




J

t




{\displaystyle J_{t}}
, no longer using

to describe the polar moment of inertia.
In objects with significant cross-sectional variation (along the axis of the applied torque), which cannot be analyzed in segments, a more complex approach may have to be used. See 3-D elasticity.
