Unitarity
The time evolution operator must be unitary. This is because we demand that the norm of the state ket must not change with time. That is,




⟨
ψ
(
t
)

|

ψ
(
t
)
⟩
=
⟨
ψ
(

t

0


)

|


U

†


(
t
,

t

0


)
U
(
t
,

t

0


)

|

ψ
(

t

0


)
⟩
=
⟨
ψ
(

t

0


)

|

ψ
(

t

0


)
⟩
.


{\displaystyle \langle \psi (t)|\psi (t)\rangle =\langle \psi (t_{0})|U^{\dagger }(t,t_{0})U(t,t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle =\langle \psi (t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle .}

Therefore,





U

†


(
t
,

t

0


)
U
(
t
,

t

0


)
=
I
.


{\displaystyle U^{\dagger }(t,t_{0})U(t,t_{0})=I.}

Identity
When t = t0, U is the identity operator, since





|

ψ
(

t

0


)
⟩
=
U
(

t

0


,

t

0


)

|

ψ
(

t

0


)
⟩
.


{\displaystyle |\psi (t_{0})\rangle =U(t_{0},t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle .}

Closure
Time evolution from t0 to t may be viewed as a two-step time evolution, first from t0 to an intermediate time t1, and then from t1 to the final time t. Therefore,




U
(
t
,

t

0


)
=
U
(
t
,

t

1


)
U
(

t

1


,

t

0


)
.


{\displaystyle U(t,t_{0})=U(t,t_{1})U(t_{1},t_{0}).}
