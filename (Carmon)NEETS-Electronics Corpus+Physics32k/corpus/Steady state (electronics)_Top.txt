In electronics, steady state is an equilibrium condition of a circuit or network that occurs as the effects of transients are no longer important.
Steady state determination is an important topic, because many design specifications of electronic systems are given in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Periodic steady-state solution is also a prerequisite for small signal dynamic modeling. Steady-state analysis is therefore an indispensable component of the design process.
