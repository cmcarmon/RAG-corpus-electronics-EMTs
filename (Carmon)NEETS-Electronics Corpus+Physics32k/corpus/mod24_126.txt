In addition, the NA is commonly used to specify multimode fibers. However, for small core
diameters, such as in single mode fibers, the ray theory breaks down. Ray theory describes only the
direction a plane wave takes in a fiber. Ray theory eliminates any properties of the plane wave that
interfere with the transmission of light along a fiber. In reality, plane waves interfere with each other.
Therefore, only certain types of rays are able to propagate in an optical fiber. Optical fibers can support
only a specific number of guided modes. In small core fibers, the number of modes supported is one or
only a few modes. Mode theory is used to describe the types of plane waves able to propagate along an
optical fiber.
