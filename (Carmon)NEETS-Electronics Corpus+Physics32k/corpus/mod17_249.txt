Finally, you must have two diodes to obtain delayed agc. If only one diode were used, the agc would
be developed from the detector diode, and there would be no delayed action. Or, if a signal diode were
biased to provide the delaying action desired, no signal would pass to the audio amplifier until the bias
was exceeded by the input signal.
