Every central force can produce uniform circular motion, provided that the initial radius r and speed v satisfy the equation for the centripetal force







m

v

r

F
(
r
)


{\displaystyle {\frac {mv^{2}}{r}}=F(r)}

If this equation is satisfied at the initial moments, it will be satisfied at all later times; the particle will continue to move in a circle of radius r at speed v forever.
