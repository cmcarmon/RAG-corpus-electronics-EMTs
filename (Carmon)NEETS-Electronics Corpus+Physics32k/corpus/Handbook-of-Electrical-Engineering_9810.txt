1. Speed of the response—how quickly does the system reach its ﬁnal value
2. Accuracy—how close is the ﬁnal response to the desired response
3. Relative stability—how stable is the system or how close is the system to instability
4. Sensitivity—what happens to the system response if the system parameters change
