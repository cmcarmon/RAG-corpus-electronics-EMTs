is caused by the
strength of signals that degrades with distance over a
transmission link. Three factors are related to the
attenuation:
. The received signal should have sufﬁcient strength
to be intelligently interpreted by a receiver. An
ampliﬁer or a repeater is needed to boost the
strength of the signal.
