14.2.8 PDM and PPM (see Figure 14.2.7) have the ad-
vantage of being immune to nonlinear distortion,
because the pulse is either on or off. However, in
exchange, the transmission bandwidth must be
B ≥ 1/D >> W , which is needed to accommo-
date pulses with duration D << Ts ≤ 1/(2W ).
Let D be the pulse duration of the PPM waveform
in Figure 14.2.7. Let the maximum position shift
be ±. For  = 2D and fs = 20 kHz, ﬁnd the
maximum allowed value of D and the minimum
required transmission bandwidth.
mission bandwidth B = 250 kHz.
