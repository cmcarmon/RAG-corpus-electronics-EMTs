cation (inner/outer product), correlation, and the like.
A number of DSP algorithms can be written in a recursive
equation: inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁlter,
least mean
square/recursive least square (LMS/RLS) adaptive ﬁlter, and
so on. Finally, DSP is applied in a variety of applications
ranging from seismogram to the communication system in
the space shuttle/station. As a result, a variety of data types
and sampling rates must be taken into consideration.
