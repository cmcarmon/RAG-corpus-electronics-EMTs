As soon as the card switch is actuated, the tube under test is automatically subjected to an
interelement short test and a heater-to-cathode leakage test. A blinking or steady glow of any of the short
test lamps is an indication of an interelement short. If the short test lamps remain dark, no interelement
shorts exist within the tube. If a short exists between two or more elements, the short test lamp or lamps
connected between these elements remain dark, and the remaining lamps light. The abbreviations for the
tube elements are located on the front panel just below the short test shield so that the neon lamps are
between them. This enables the operator to tell which elements are shorted. Heater-to-cathode shorts are
indicated as leakage currents on the #1 meter scale. If the meter reads above the green area, the tube
should be replaced. A direct heater-to-cathode short causes the meter to read full scale.
