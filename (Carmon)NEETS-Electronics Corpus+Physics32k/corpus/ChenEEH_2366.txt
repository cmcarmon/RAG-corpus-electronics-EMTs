The zero or negligible thickness formulas given in equations
5.50 to 5.55 can be modiﬁed to include the thickness of the
strip conductor. The ﬁrst-order effect of a strip conductor of
ﬁnite thickness t is to increase the capacitance. Therefore, an
approximate correction is made by replacing the strip width W
by the effective width Weff . The following relations for Weff =h
are useful when t < h and t < W =2:
