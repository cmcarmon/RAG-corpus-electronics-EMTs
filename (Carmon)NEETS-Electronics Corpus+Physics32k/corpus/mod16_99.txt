Troubleshooting is a term which we in the electronics field use daily. But what does it mean?
Troubleshooting is sometimes thought to be the simple repair of a piece of equipment when it fails to
function properly. This, however, is only part of the picture. In addition to repair, you, as a troubleshooter,
must be able to evaluate equipment performance. You evaluate performance by comparing your
knowledge of how the equipment should operate with the way it is actually performing. You must
evaluate equipment both before and after repairs are accomplished.
