The reactance-type equipment gives approximate values only. Like the analog multimeter, it is used
only when portability and speed are more important than precision. If the ohmic resistance of the inductor
is low, the inductance value obtained from the conversion chart can be used directly. If the ohmic value
(as measured with an ohmmeter) is appreciable, a more accurate value of inductance can be obtained by
use of the following formula:
