In semiconductors and insulating materials, an electric field causes charged particles like electrons to reach a specific "drift velocity" that is parallel to the direction of the field. It is different from the behavior of the free charged particles in a vacuum, in which a field accelerates the particle. The proportionality factor between the magnitudes of the drift-velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
and the electric field





E




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}}
is called the mobility



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
:




v
=
μ


E




{\displaystyle v=\mu {\mathcal {E}}}

The Child's Law behavior of a space charge limited current that applies in a vacuum diode doesn't generally apply in a solid, and is replaced by the Mott-Gurney form. For a thin slab of material of thickness



L


{\displaystyle L}
, the electric current density



J


{\displaystyle J}
flowing through the slab is:

{\displaystyle J={\frac {9{\epsilon }{\mu }{V_{a}}^{2}}{8{L}^{3}}}}

where




V

{\displaystyle V_{a}}
is the voltage that has been applied across the slab and

{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is the dielectric constant of the solid.
In the velocity-saturation regime, this equation takes the following form

{\displaystyle J={\frac {2{\epsilon }{v}{V_{a}}}{{L}^{2}}}}

Note the different dependence of

{\displaystyle J}
on

{\displaystyle V_{a}}
in each of the two cases. Interestingly, in the ballistic case (assuming no collisions), the Mott-Gurney equation takes the form of the more familiar Child-Langmuir law.
The above derivations make the following assumptions:
There is only one type of charge carrier present.
The material has no intrinsic conductivity, but charges are injected into it from one electrode and captured by the other.
The carrier mobility



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
and the dielectric permittivity



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
are constant throughout the sample.
The electric field at the charge-injecting cathode is zero.
As an application example, the steady-state space-charge-limited current across a piece of silicon with a charge carrier mobility of 1500 cm2/V-s, a dielectric constant of 11.9, an area of 10−8cm2 and a thickness of 10−4cm can be calculated by an on line calculator as 126.4uA at voltage 3V.
