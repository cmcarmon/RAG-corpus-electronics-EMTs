The drag coefficient




c


d






{\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {d} }\,}
is defined as





c


d



=




2

F


d





ρ

u

2


A







{\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {d} }={\dfrac {2F_{\mathrm {d} }}{\rho u^{2}A}}\,}

where:





F


d






{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {d} }\,}
is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,




ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}
is the mass density of the fluid,




u



{\displaystyle u\,}
is the flow speed of the object relative to the fluid,




A



{\displaystyle A\,}
is the reference area.
The reference area depends on what type of drag coefficient is being measured. For automobiles and many other objects, the reference area is the projected frontal area of the vehicle. This may not necessarily be the cross sectional area of the vehicle, depending on where the cross section is taken. For example, for a sphere



A
=
π

r

2





{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}\,}
(note this is not the surface area =





4
π

r

2




{\displaystyle \!\ 4\pi r^{2}}
).
For airfoils, the reference area is the nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower than for a car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.
Airships and some bodies of revolution use the volumetric drag coefficient, in which the reference area is the square of the cube root of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.
Two objects having the same reference area moving at the same speed through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.
