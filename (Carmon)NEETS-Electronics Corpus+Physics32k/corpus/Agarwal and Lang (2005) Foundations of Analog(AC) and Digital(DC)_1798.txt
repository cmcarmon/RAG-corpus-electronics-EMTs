Alternatively, if are interested only in the maximum value of the output voltage at the
end of each cycle, and we do not care about the exact waveforms, we can use the
much simpler energy method discussed in Example 12.4, with one difference. In our
example, since the switches have a finite resistance, and since we have assumed that S1
is closed and s2 is open for a long period of time, iL in Equation 12.31 is computed
differently as
