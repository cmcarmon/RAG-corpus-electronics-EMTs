UHF transmitters using a klystron in the ﬁnal output stage must operate class A, the most linear but also
most inefﬁcient operating mode for a vacuum tube. Two types of klystrons have traditionally been used: integral
cavity and external cavity devices. The basic theory of operation is identical for each tube, but the mechanical
approach is radically different. In the integral cavity klystron, the cavities are built into the device to form a
