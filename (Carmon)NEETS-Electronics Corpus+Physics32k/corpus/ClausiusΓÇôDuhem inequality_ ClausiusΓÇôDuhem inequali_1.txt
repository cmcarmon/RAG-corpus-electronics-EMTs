{\displaystyle \rho ~({\dot {e}}-T~{\dot {\eta }})-{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}:{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {v} \leq -{\cfrac {\mathbf {q} \cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}T}{T}}}

where






e
˙





{\displaystyle {\dot {e}}}
is the time derivative of the specific internal energy



e



{\displaystyle e\,}
(the internal energy per unit mass),




σ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}
is the Cauchy stress, and




∇


v



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\mathbf {v} }
is the gradient of the velocity. This inequality incorporates the balance of energy and the balance of linear and angular momentum into the expression for the Clausius–Duhem inequality.
