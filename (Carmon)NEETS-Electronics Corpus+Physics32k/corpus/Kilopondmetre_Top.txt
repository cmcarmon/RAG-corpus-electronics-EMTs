The Kilopondmetre is an obsolete unit of torque and energy in the gravitational metric system. It is abbreviated kp·m or m·kp, older publications often use m­kg and kg­m as well.
Torque is a product of the length of a lever and the force applied to the lever. One kilopond is the force applied to one kilogram due to gravitational acceleration; this force is exactly 9.80665 N. This means 1 kp·m = 9.80665 kg·m2/s2 = 9.80665 N·m.
