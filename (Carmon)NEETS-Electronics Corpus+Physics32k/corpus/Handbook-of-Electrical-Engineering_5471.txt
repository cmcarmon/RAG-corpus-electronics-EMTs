ELL = rms line-to-line voltage of the converter ac bus
I1 = rms value of fundamental frequency component of the converter ac current
h = harmonic number
a = valve Ô¨Åring delay angle (from the instant the valve voltage is positive)
u = overlap angle (also called commutation angle)
f = phase angle between voltage and current
