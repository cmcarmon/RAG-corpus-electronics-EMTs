Frequency-shift keyers are, of course, more complicated than this simple illustration would seem to
show, but the basic principles are the same. Still, the keyer does change the oscillator frequency by a
certain number of cycles. Further, this change must be correlated with the multiplication factor of the
transmitter to cause the desired shift between mark and space frequencies.
