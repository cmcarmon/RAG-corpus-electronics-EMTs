One calendar day ends, and the next day begins, during the evening. The Talmud states there is an uncertainty as to whether the day ends at sunset or nightfall, so the time in between has a status of doubt. The Talmud in Pesachim states there are four mil between sunset and nightfall. However, the Talmud in Tractate Shabbat states that there are just three-quarters of a mil between sunset and nightfall.
The Geonim and the Vilna Gaon (GR"A) explain that the second statement is correct.
Rabbeinu Tam and many other Rishonim say rather that there are two "sunsets," the first of which [actual sunset] is four mil before nightfall, and the second of which is just three-quarters of a mil before.
According to the first opinion, nightfall is 13½-18 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, sun falls 3-4° below the horizon). According to the second opinion, nightfall occurs exactly 72 minutes after sundown (or its equivalent, when the sun has fallen anywhere from 6.45 to 16.1 degrees below the horizon).
In practice, when the question is whether it is too late to do a something that must be done by day, the practice is to follow one of the earlier opinions. When the question is whether it is too early to do something that must be done by night, the practice is to follow one of the later opinions. For calculating the end of Shabbat or major holidays, the desire not to end Shabbat early, along with the Talmud's description of the end of Shabbat in terms of the appearance of stars in the sky, leads to the use of the later opinions.
