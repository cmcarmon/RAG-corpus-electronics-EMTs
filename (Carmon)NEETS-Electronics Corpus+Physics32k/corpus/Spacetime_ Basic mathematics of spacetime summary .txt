^Galilean transformations (click here to return to main)
A basic goal is to be able to compare measurements made by observers in relative motion.
Transformation between Galilean frames is linear. Given that two coordinate systems are in standard configuration, the coordinate transformation in the x-axis is simply





x
′

=
x
−
v
t


{\displaystyle x'=x-vt}


Velocities are simply additive. If frame S' is moving at velocity v with respect to frame S, and within frame S', observer O' measures an object moving with velocity u', then





u
′

=
u
−
v


{\displaystyle u'=u-v}
or



u
=

u

+
v


{\displaystyle u=u'+v}


^Relativistic composition of velocities (click here to return to main)
The relativistic composition of velocities is more complex than the Galilean composition of velocities:




u
=



v

u

(

c

)



.


{\displaystyle u={v+u' \over 1+(vu'/c^{2})}.}


In the low speed limit, the overall result is indistinguishable from the Galilean formula.
The sum of two velocities cannot be greater than the speed of light.

^Lorentz transformations (click here to return to main)
The Lorentz transformations combine expressions for time dilation, length contraction, and relativity of simultaneity into a unified set of expressions for mapping measurements between two inertial reference frames.
Given two coordinate systems in standard configuration, the transformation equations for the



t


{\displaystyle t}
and



x


{\displaystyle x}
axes are:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}t'&=\gamma \left(t-{\frac {vx}{c^{2}}}\right)\\x'&=\gamma \left(x-vt\right)\end{aligned}}}


There have been many alternative derivations of the Lorentz transformations since Einstein's original work in 1905.
The Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity. Because of this: (i) Spacetime looks the same everywhere. (ii) There is no preferred frame. (iii) If two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.
^Doppler effect (click here to return to main)
The formulas for classical Doppler effect depend on whether it is the source or the receiver that is moving with respect to the medium.
In relativity, there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. For the longitudinal Doppler effect, a single formula holds for both scenarios:




f

.


{\displaystyle f={\sqrt {\frac {1-\beta }{1+\beta }}}\,f_{0}.}


Transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. Although there are subtleties involved, the basic scenarios can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments.
^Energy and momentum (click here to return to main)
In relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector.
The relativistic energy-momentum vector has terms for energy and for spatial momentum. Using an uppercase P to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase p to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as




P
≡
(
E

c

p

{\displaystyle P\equiv (E/c,{\vec {p}})=(E/c,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})}


Consideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to his famous



E
=
m

c

2




{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
equation as well as to his concept of relativistic mass.
^Conservation laws (click here to return to main)
The conservation laws arise from fundamental symmetries of nature.
Classical conservation of mass does not hold true in relativity. Since mass and energy are interconvertible, conservation of mass is replaced by conservation of mass-energy.
For analysis of energy and momentum problems involving interacting particles, the most convenient frame is usually the "center-of-momentum" frame.
Newtonian momenta, calculated as



p
=
m
v
,


{\displaystyle p=mv,}
fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The relativistic conservation law for energy and momentum replaces the three classical conservation laws for energy, momentum and mass.
