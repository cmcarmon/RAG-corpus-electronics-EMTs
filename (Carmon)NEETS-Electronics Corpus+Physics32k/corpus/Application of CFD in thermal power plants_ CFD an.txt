The economiser is a crucial component for efficient performance of a thermal power plant. It is a non-steaming type of heat exchanger which is placed in the convective zone of the furnace. It takes the heat energy of the flue gases for heating the feed water before it enters the boiler drum. The thermal efficiency/boiler efficiency largely depends on the performance of the economiser. CFD analysis helps in optimizing the thermal performance of the economiser by analysing the pressure, velocity and temperature distribution, and to identify the critical areas for further improvement with the result obtained by CFD analysis.
