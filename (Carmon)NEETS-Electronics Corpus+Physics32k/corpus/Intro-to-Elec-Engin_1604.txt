For torques less than the rated value, a low-power drive operates predominantly in the discontinu-
ous conduction mode, for which a zero armature-current interval exists besides the duty interval.
With continuous conduction, as seen from Equation (16.1.39), the speed–torque characteristics
are parallel straight lines whose slope depends on Ra, the armature circuit resistance. A ﬁlter
inductor is sometimes included to reduce the discontinuous conduction zone, although such an
addition will lead to an increase in losses, armature circuit time constant, noise, cost, weight, and
volume of the drive.
