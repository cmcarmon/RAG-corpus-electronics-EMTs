This is how a switch mounted on the wall of a house can control a lamp that is mounted
down a long hallway, or even in another room, far away from the switch. The switch itself
is constructed of a pair of conductive contacts (usually made of some kind of metal) forced
together by a mechanical lever actuator or pushbutton. When the contacts touch each other,
electrons are able to ﬂow from one to the other and the circuit’s continuity is established; when
the contacts are separated, electron ﬂow from one to the other is prevented by the insulation
of the air between, and the circuit’s continuity is broken.
