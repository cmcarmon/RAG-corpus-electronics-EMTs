op amp, ﬁnd vo as a function of va and vb.
5.4.14 For the low-pass ﬁlter conﬁguration of Figure
5.4.13, with Ri = Rf = 1 M, calculate Cf such
that the 3-dB point is at 1 kHz.
5.4.15 For the high-pass ﬁlter conﬁguration of Figure
5.4.13, with vo/vi = 2.5 at 10 MHz and Ci = 100
pF, determine Ri and Rf to yield a 3-dB point at 1
MHz.
