Reverse-biased photodetectors are highly linear devices. Detector linearity means that the output
electrical current (photocurrent) of the photodiode is linearly proportional to the input optical power.
Reverse-biased photodetectors remain linear over an extended range (6 decades or more) of photocurrent
before saturation occurs. Output saturation occurs at input optical power levels typically greater than 1
