A special type of autotransformer is a variable 
 autotransformer, in which the load is connected to 
a movable arm and one side of the autotransformer 
(Figure 27-9). Moving the arm varies the turns ratio, 
producing a change in the voltage across the load. The 
output voltage can be varied from 0 to 130 VAC.
