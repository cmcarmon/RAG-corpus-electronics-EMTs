If you pass current through an inductor, you create a magnetic field around 
the wire. If you change the current, increasing it or decreasing it, the mag-
netic flux around the coil changes, and a voltage is induced across the 
inductor. That voltage, sometimes called back voltage, causes a current flow 
that opposes the main current. This property of inductors is known as self‚Äê 
inductance, or simply inductance.
