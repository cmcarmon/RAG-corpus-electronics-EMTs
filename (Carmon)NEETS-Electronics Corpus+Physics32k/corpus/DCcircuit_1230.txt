There are already a few industrial applications of superconductors, especially since the
recent (1987) advent of the yttrium-barium-copper-oxygen ceramic, which only requires liquid
nitrogen to cool, as opposed to liquid helium. It is even possible to order superconductivity
kits from educational suppliers which can be operated in high school labs (liquid nitrogen not
included). Typically, these kits exhibit superconductivity by the Meissner effect, suspending a
tiny magnet in mid-air over a superconducting disk cooled by a bath of liquid nitrogen.
