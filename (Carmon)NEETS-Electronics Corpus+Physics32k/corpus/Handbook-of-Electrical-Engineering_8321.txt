Providing Test Points. A test point is an input or output signal to control or observe intermediate signals in
a logic circuit. For example, if triple redundancy has been used to implement a fault-tolerant circuit, additional
output signals might be provided so that signal values from the identical functional units become individually
observable, improving the testability of the overall circuit. Similarly, control signals might be provided so that,
during  testing,  outputs  from  some  functional  units  may  be  forced  into  certain  states  which  allow  easier
observation of the outputs from other circuits. Recommended sites for inserting test points include redundant
nets, nets with large fan-outs, preset and clear inputs of ﬂip-ﬂops, nets that carry system clock signals, (at least
some of the) inputs to logic circuit gates with large number of inputs (i.e., large fan-in), data and/or address
lines of bus lines, as well as intermediate points in cascaded circuits (such as long ripple counters, shift registers).
