When the body is irradiated by energy from a point source, the total body surface is usually not 
exposed. The larger the area exposed and the larger the radiation power density, the higher the body 
temperature rise and the greater the hazard. Microwave radiation from a radar source will "cook" you 
internally, just as a microwave oven cooks a chicken.
