The femtometre (symbol fm) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to 10−15 metres. In particle physics, this unit is more commonly called a fermi, also with abbreviation "fm". To help compare different orders of magnitude this section lists lengths between 10−15 metres and 10−14 metres (1 femtometre (fm) and 10 fm).
1 fm – length of a proton
1 fm – length of a neutron
1.5 fm – diameter of the scattering cross section of an 11 MeV proton with a target proton
2.81794 fm – classical electron radius
7 fm – the radius of the effective scattering cross section for a gold nucleus scattering a 6 MeV alpha particle over 140 degrees
