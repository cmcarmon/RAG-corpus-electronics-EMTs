• Propagation delay td is a certain amount of delay for a change to occur. It is deﬁned here
as the time to change from 0 to 10% of the ﬁnal value. (Sometimes propagation delay is
deﬁned as the time between the 50% level of Vi and the 50% level of Vo.) When Vi abruptly
changes from 0 to 5 V, note that the output voltage and collector current do not initially
change during the propagation delay time.
• Rise time tr is the time needed to change from 10 to 90% of the ﬁnal level.
• Propagation delay ts occurs when the input pulse returns to 0 V (i.e., logic level 0). This is
a result of the time required to remove charge stored in the base region before the transistor
begins to switch out of saturation and is usually longer than td.
• Fall time tf is the time required for the output voltage and the collector current to change
state. That is the time required to switch through the active region from saturation to cutoff.
