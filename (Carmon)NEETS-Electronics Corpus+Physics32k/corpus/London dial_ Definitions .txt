Centre of delineation
the point where the styles and all the hour lines meet. On a dials with a thick gnomon, there will be two centres of delineation, separated by a noon gap.
Gnomon
the vertical triangular component. The gnomon is precisely angled for the latitude, in London that is nominally 51Â° 30' N. The London gnomon has thickness so the style that casts the shadow for the morning hours is the western edge of the gnomon while the eastern edge of the gnomon is the style that cast the shadow for the afternoon hours.
Chapter ring
this is the ring of written numbers. On the chapter ring may be half-hour indicators and quarter-hour indicators.
