The junction	field	effect	transistor	(JFET) is a 
 unipolar transistor that functions using only  majority 
carriers.  The  JFET  is  a  voltage-operated   device. 
JFETs  are  constructed  from  N-type  and  P-type 
 semiconductor materials and are capable of  amplifying 
 electronic  signals, but they are constructed  differently 
from  bipolar transistors and operate on different 
 principles. Knowing how a JFET is constructed helps to 
 understand how it operates.
