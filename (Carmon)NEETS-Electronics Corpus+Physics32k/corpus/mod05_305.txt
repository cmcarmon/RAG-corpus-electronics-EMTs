For purposes of explaining rotor movement, let's assume that we can place a bar magnet in the center
of the stator diagrams of figure 4-5. We'll mount this magnet so that it is free to rotate in this area. Let's
also assume that the bar magnet is aligned so that at point 1 its south pole is opposite the large N of the
stator field.
