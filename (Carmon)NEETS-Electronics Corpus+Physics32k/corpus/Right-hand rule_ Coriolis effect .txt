As viewed from the rotating Earth, the path of a moving object along a northâ€“south trajectory appears to bend to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This causes low-pressure areas in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate according to the right-hand rule (thumb pointing away from Earth). Handedness is not obvious here, but it is clear in the underlying mathematics (vector cross product).
