Consider the case of a solid sphere moving in a stationary liquid with a constant velocity. The liquid is modeled as an incompressible fluid (i.e. with constant density), and being stationary means that its velocity tends towards zero as the distance from the sphere approaches infinity.
For a real body there will be a transient effect due to its acceleration as it begins its motion; however after enough time it will tend towards zero, so that the fluid velocity everywhere will approach the one obtained in the hypothetical case in which the body is already moving for infinite time.
Thus we assume a sphere of radius a moving at a constant velocity






U

{\displaystyle {\vec {U}}}
, in an incompressible fluid that is at rest at infinity. We will work in coordinates







x

m




{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}_{m}}
that move along with the sphere with the coordinate center located at the sphere's center. We have:

{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}(\|{{\vec {x}}_{m}}\|\rightarrow \infty )\rightarrow 0}

Since these boundary conditions, as well as the equation of motions, are time invariant (i.e. they are unchanged by shifting the time

{\displaystyle t\rightarrow t+\Delta t}
) when expressed in the

The equations of motion are the Navier-Stokes equations defined in the resting frame coordinates

Due to the continuity equation for incompressible fluid
