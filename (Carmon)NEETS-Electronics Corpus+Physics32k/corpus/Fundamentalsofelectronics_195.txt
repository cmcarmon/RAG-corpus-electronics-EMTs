Referring to the diﬀerential equation for
dt vout + vout = vin), when we let the output and input voltages be complex exponentials, we obtain
RC d
the same relationship between their complex amplitudes. Thus, using impedances is equivalent to using the
diﬀerential equation and solving it when the source(s) is a complex exponential.
