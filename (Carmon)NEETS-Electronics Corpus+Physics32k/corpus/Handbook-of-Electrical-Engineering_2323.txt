Overview of Equivalent Circuit Models
Circuit analysis is an important tool in circuit design. It saves considerable time, at the circuit design stage, by
providing the designer with a tool for predicting the circuit behavior without actually processing the circuit.
An electronic circuit usually contains active devices, in addition to passive components. While the current
and voltage behavior of passive devices is deﬁned by simple relationships, the equivalent relationships in active
devices are quite complicated in nature. Therefore, in order to analyze an active circuit, the devices are replaced
by equivalent circuit models that give the same output characteristics as the active device itself. These models
are made up of passive elements, voltage sources, and current sources. Equivalent circuit models provide the
designer with reasonably accurate values for frequencies below 1 GHz for bipolar junction transistors (BJTs),
and their use is quite popular in circuit analysis software. Some ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET) models are accurate
up to 10 GHz. As the analysis frequency increases, however, so does the model complexity. Since the equivalent
circuit models are based on some fundamental equations describing the device behavior, they can also be used
to predict the characteristics of the device itself.
