Electric strikes can be differentiated in a number of ways, frame type it can be installed in, duty (continuous or intermittent), and which variety of locking mechanism on the door it can work with. The four most common locking mechanisms concerned with electric strikes are Cylindrical, Deadbolt, Mortise, and Rim Panic Exit Devices. Cylindrical locks tend towards residential use and, as such, electric strikes for cylindrical locks tends towards more economy. Deadbolts, also known as night latches, do not have a spring mechanism which means the strike for a deadlatch is 'hold' only (the dead bolt is thrown and it engages in the electric strike cavity, the electric strike can release it but cannot subsequently 'recapture it' since the deadbolt lacks the spring latching capability of the other lock sets). Mortise type locksets tend towards larger projecting latches from the door to engage deeper in the frame and electric strikes used for these locking mechanisms require more cutting and space in the frame. Rim Panic devices are required in many buildings as a 'single motion' means of egress and electric strikes used in these situations tend towards entirely different designs and opening actions as compared to electric strikes for other situations.
