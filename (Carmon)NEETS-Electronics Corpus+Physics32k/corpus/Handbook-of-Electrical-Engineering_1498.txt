Hidden Markov Models As Acoustic Models for Speech Recognition
There are many ways to characterize the temporal sequence of speech sounds as represented by a sequence of
spectral observations. The most common way is to model the temporal sequence of spectra in terms of a Markov
chain to describe the way one sound changes to another by imposing an explicitly probabilistic structure on
the representation of the evolutional sequence.
