The resistance of small
carbon-core resistors can range from 1  to 106 . Assuming that the core of these
resistors is 1 mm in diameter and 5 mm long, what must be the range of resistivity of
the carbon cores?
Given a 1-mm diameter, the cross-sectional area of the core is A ≈ 7.9 × 10
Further, its length is l = 5 × 10
Finally, using Equation 1.5, with 1  ≤ R ≤ 106 , it follows that the approximate
range of its resistivity is 1.6 × 10
