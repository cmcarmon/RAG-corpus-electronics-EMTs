a m p l i f i e r c i r c u i t This example develops a small-signal model of the
operational amplifier circuit shown in Figure 7.63 and previously discussed in Exam-
ple 7.21. It then uses that model to determine the small-signal gain of the amplifier.
The small-signal model and gain are determined for the bias conditions established by
VIN1 = VIN2 = 0. Under these balanced bias conditions, ID1 = ID2 = I/2.
