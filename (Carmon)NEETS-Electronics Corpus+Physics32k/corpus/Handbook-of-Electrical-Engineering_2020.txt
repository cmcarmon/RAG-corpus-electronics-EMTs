Since most of the energy of typical room noise and the highest level of reverberation in a room is at low
frequencies, one would like to use arrays that have their highest directivity (i.e., narrowest beamwidth) at low
frequencies.  Unfortunately,  this  need  collides  with  the  physics  of  arrays:  the  smaller  the  array  relative  to  the
wavelength, the wider the beam. (Again, the corresponding notion in ﬁlter theory is that systems with shorter
impulse responses have wider bandwidth.) One solution to this problem is to superimpose different-size arrays
and ﬁlter each output by the appropriate bandpass ﬁlter, similar to a crossover network used in two- or three-
way loudspeaker designs. Such a superposition of three ﬁve-element arrays is shown in Fig. 19.2. Note that we
only need nine microphones in this example, instead of 5
