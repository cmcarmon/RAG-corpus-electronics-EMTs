The large intrinsic region increases the transit time of electrons crossing the region. Above 100 
megahertz, electrons begin to accumulate in the intrinsic region. The carrier storage in the intrinsic region 
causes the diode to stop acting as a rectifier and begin acting as a variable resistance. The equivalent
