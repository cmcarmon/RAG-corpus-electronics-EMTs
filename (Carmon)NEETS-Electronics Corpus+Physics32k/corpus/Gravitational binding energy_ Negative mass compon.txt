Two bodies, placed at the distance R from each other, exert a gravitational force on a third body slightly smaller when R is small. This can be seen as a negative mass component of the system, equal, for uniformly spherical solutions, to:

{\displaystyle M_{\mathrm {binding} }=-{\frac {3GM^{2}}{5Rc^{2}}}}

It can be easily demonstrated that this negative component can never exceed the positive component of a system. A negative binding energy greater than the mass of the system itself would indeed require that the radius of the system be smaller than:

{\displaystyle R\leq {\frac {3GM}{5c^{2}}}}

which is

{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{10}}}
smaller than its Schwarzschild radius:

{\displaystyle R\leq {\frac {3}{10}}r_{\mathrm {s} }}

and therefore never visible to an external observer.
