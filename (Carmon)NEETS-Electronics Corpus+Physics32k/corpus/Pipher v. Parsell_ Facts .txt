Three 16-year-olds were driving in a truck: two boys and a girl in the middle seat. The passenger, one of the boys, grabbed the steering wheel as if intending to make a car crash, at which all the occupants of laughed. A few minutes later the boy grabbed the steering wheel again, this time actually causing an accident. The girl, suffered damages and sued the driver.
"As they were traveling at 55 mph, Beisel unexpectedly “grabbed the steering wheel causing the truck to veer off onto the shoulder of the road.” Parsell testified that Beisel's conduct caused him both shock and surprise. Although Beisel's conduct prompted him to be on his guard, Parsell further testified that he did not expect Beisel to grab the wheel again. Nevertheless, his recognition of how serious Beisel's conduct was, shows he was aware that he now had someone in his car who had engaged in dangerous behavior."
Parsell testified that he did nothing in response to Beisel's initial action. Approximately thirty seconds later, Beisel again yanked the steering wheel, causing Parsell's truck to leave the roadway, slide down an embankment and strike a tree. Pipher was injured as a result of the collision."
