It should be apparent now that the circuit has been reduced to a simple series conﬁgura-
tion with only two (equivalent) resistances. The ﬁnal step in reduction is to add these two
resistances to come up with a total circuit resistance. When we add those two equivalent resis-
tances, we get a resistance of 198.70 Ω. Now, we can re-draw the circuit as a single equivalent
resistance and add the total resistance ﬁgure to the rightmost column of our table. Note that
the ”Total” column has been relabeled (R1//R2−−R3//R4) to indicate how it relates electrically
to the other columns of ﬁgures. The ”−−” symbol is used here to represent ”series,” just as the
”//” symbol is used to represent ”parallel.”
