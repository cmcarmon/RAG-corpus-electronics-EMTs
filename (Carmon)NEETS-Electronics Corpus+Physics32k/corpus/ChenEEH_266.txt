Compared with half-bridge converters and asymmetrical
and symmetrical half-bridge converters, the push-pull forward
topology has a larger transformer’s turns ratio. For example, if
VRM input voltage is 48 V and output voltage is 3.3 V, for both
the symmetrical and asymmetrical half-bridges, the trans-
former’s turns ratio is 3 to 1. For the push-pull forward
converter, the transformer’s turns ratio is 6 to 1. Therefore,
the conduction loss of the primary switches in a push-pull
forward converter is lower. As a result, the push-pull forward
converter has a higher efﬁciency. At heavy load, the efﬁciency
of the push-pull forward converter is 2 to 3% higher than that
of either half-bridge converter.
