The amp‐hour or milliamp‐hour rating for a bat­
tery gives you an idea of how much current a 
battery can conduct for a given length of time. 
For example, a 9‐volt battery usually has about 
a 500 milliamp‐hour rating. Such a battery can 
power a circuit using 25 milliamps for approxi­
mately 20 hours before its voltage begins to drop. 
(I checked a 9‐volt battery that I’d used for a few 
days, and found that it was producing only 7 volts.) 
An  AA  battery  that  has  a  1500   milliamp‐hour 
rating can power a circuit drawing 25  milliamps  
of current for approximately 60 hours.
Six  AA  batteries  in  series,  which  produce 
about  9  volts,  will  last  longer  than  a  single
