Computer network architecture refers to the convention used to deÔ¨Åne how the different
protocols of the system interact with each other to support the end users. The most common
network architecture model is the open-systems interconnections (OSI). Figure 6.4.1 shows
the ISO (International Standards Organization) seven-layer model for an OSI. Although not all
layers need be implemented, the more layers that are used, the more functionality and reliability
are built into the system. Starting from the bottom layer, the functions of the layers are as
follows.
