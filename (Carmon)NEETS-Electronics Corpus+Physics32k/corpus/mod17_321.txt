The receiver we will discuss is a triple-conversion superheterodyne, tunable from 2 to 30 megahertz. 
Triple conversion uses three IF frequencies to give better adjacent-channel selectivity and greater image-
frequency suppression. Figure 3-10 shows the front panel of this receiver where tuning is done digitally 
by five controls and a switch. A display window directly above each control provides a digital readout of 
the frequency setting. The displayed frequency can be changed in 1-kilohertz increments. The front panel 
switch allows the operating frequency to be changed in 100- or 500-hertz increments depending on the 
model. This will provide you with 280,000 discrete frequencies locked to a very accurate frequency 
standard. You can continuously tune each 1,000-hertz increment by selecting the VERNIER position of 
the hertz switch. When using the vernier, the full accuracy of the frequency standard is sacrificed. The 
receiver demodulates and provides audio outputs for the lsb, usb, isb, AM, cw, and fsk types of received 
signals.
