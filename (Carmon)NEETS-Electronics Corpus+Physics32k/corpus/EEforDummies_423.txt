If a capacitor is polarized, you really, really need to make sure to install it in 
the circuit with the proper orientation. If you reverse the leads, say, by con-
necting the + side to the ground rail in your circuit, you may cause the dielec-
tric inside the capacitor to break down, which could effectively short‚Äêcircuit 
the capacitor. Reversing the leads may damage other components in your 
circuit (by sending too much current their way), and your capacitor may  
even explode.
