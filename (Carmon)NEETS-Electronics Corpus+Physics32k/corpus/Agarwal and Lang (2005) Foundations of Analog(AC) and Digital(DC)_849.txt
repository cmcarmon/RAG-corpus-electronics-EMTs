When the MOSFET is off, there is no connection between the drain and
the source. If the voltage vGS between the gate and source terminals is above
VT, the MOSFET turns on and displays a resistance RON between its D and
S terminals. As before, there is an open circuit between the gate and source
terminals and the gate and drain terminals of the MOSFET, so iG = 0.
