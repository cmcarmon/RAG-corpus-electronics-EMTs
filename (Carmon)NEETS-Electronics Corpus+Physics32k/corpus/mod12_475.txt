Now consider what happens with a deviation in frequency at the input. If the frequency increases, the
frequency across the quadrature tank also increases. Above resonance, the tank appears capacitive to the
induced current; voltage then lags the applied voltage by more than 90 degrees, as shown in view (G).
Note in view (H) that the two grid signals have moved more out of phase and the average plate current
level has decreased.
