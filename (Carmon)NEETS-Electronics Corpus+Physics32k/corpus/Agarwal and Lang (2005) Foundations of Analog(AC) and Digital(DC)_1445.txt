All of the relevant past history of the circuit prior to t1 is summarized in
one value, q(t1). Variables that have this property are called state variables. Thus
Equation 10.79 indicates that if we know the value of the state variable at one
time, and the value of the input variable thereafter, we can find the value of the
state variable for any subsequent time.
