Example 13.5.  NMOS IV Curves: The structure generated in the previous SUPREM-IV simulation is now
passed into the device simulator and bias voltages are applied to the gate and drain. Models were included with
account for Auger and Shockley Reed Hall recombination, doping and electric Ô¨Åeld-dependent mobility, and
impact  ionization.  The  set  of  drain  characteristics  obtained  is  shown  in  Fig.  13.11.  Observe  how  the  curves
bend upward at high Vds  as the device breaks down. The Vg, = 1 curve has a negative slope at Id = 1.5e-4A as
the device enters snap-back. It is possible to model this type of behavior because impact ionization is included
in the model.
