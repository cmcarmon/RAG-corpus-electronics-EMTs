Let the force be with you
The force that pushes electrons along is technically called an electromotive 
force (abbreviated EMF or E), but it is more commonly known as voltage 
(abbreviated V). You measure voltage by using units called (conveniently) 
volts (abbreviated V). Apply enough voltage to a conductor, provide a com-
plete path through which an electric charge can move, and the free electrons
