As transistor technology continues to develop, higher power applications of transistor collector-
injection modulation will be employed. Plate and collector-injection modulation are the most commonly 
used types of modulation because the modulating signal can be applied in the final stages of rf 
amplification. This allows the majority of the rf amplifier stages to be operated class C for maximum 
efficiency. The plate and collector-injection modulators also require large amounts of af modulating 
power since the modulator stage must supply the power contained in the sidebands.
