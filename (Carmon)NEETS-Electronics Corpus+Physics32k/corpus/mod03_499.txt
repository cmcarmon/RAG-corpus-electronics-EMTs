The voltage rating of a switch refers to the maximum voltage allowable in the circuit in which the
switch is used. The voltage rating may be given as an ac voltage, a dc voltage, or both. The voltage rating
of a switch should never be exceeded. If a voltage higher than the voltage rating of the switch is applied
to the switch, the voltage may be able to "jump" the open contacts of the switch. This would make it
impossible to control the circuit in which the switch was used.
