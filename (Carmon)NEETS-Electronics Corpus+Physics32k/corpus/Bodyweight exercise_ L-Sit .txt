The individual sits with the body in an L-position, the upper body perpendicular to the ground and the legs out straight and parallel to the ground. The hands are placed beside the glutes. The hands and arms then push the entire body, including the legs, upwards off the ground with the legs remaining parallel to the ground. This exercise taxes the muscles through isometric tension.
The V-Sit variation increases the difficulty by holding the legs higher, angled away from the ground, so the individual's body forms a 'V' shape.
