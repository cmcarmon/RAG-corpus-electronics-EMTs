is such that a current i entering a dotted (undotted) terminal in one coil induces a voltage
M[di/dt] with a positive polarity at the dotted (undotted) terminal of the other coil. If the two
currents i1 and i2 were to be entering (or leaving) the dotted terminals, the adopted convention
is such that the ï¬‚uxes produced by i1 and i2 will be aiding each other, and the mutual and
self-inductance terms for each terminal pair will have the same sign; otherwise they will have
opposite signs.
