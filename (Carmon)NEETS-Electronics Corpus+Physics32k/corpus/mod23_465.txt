When this interface was originally developed in 1981, it's 5-Mbits per second transfer rate was 
considered too fast. They actually slowed it down by using a 6:1 interleave factor (we'll define this later) 
so it could operate with the computers being built at that time. With today's transfer rates pushing the 
envelope at 24 Mbits per second, you can see that it's now one of the slowest interfaces.
