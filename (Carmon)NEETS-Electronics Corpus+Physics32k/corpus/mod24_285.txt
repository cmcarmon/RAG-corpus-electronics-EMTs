The fiber drawing process begins by feeding the glass preform into the drawing furnace. The
drawing furnace softens the end of the preform to the melting point. Manufacturers then pull the softened
preform into a thin glass filament (glass fiber). To protect the bare fiber from contaminants,
manufacturers add an acrylate coating in the draw process. The coating protects the bare fiber from
contaminants such as atmospheric dust and water vapor. Figure 3-11 illustrates the process of drawing an
optical fiber from the preform.
