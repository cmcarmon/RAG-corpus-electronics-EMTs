Coherence Processing
Coherence is a normalized (to lie between zero and unity) cross-spectral density function that is a measure of
the similarity of received signals and noise between any sensors of the array. The complex coherence function
between two wide-sense-stationary processes x and y is deÔ¨Åned by
