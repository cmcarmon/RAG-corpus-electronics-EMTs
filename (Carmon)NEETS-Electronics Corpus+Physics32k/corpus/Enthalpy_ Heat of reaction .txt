The total enthalpy of a system cannot be measured directly, the enthalpy change of a system is measured instead. Enthalpy change is defined by the following equation:




Δ
H
=

H


f



−

H


i



,


{\displaystyle \Delta H=H_{\mathrm {f} }-H_{\mathrm {i} },}

where
ΔH is the "enthalpy change",
Hf is the final enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the products),
Hi is the initial enthalpy of the system (in a chemical reaction, the enthalpy of the reactants).
For an exothermic reaction at constant pressure, the system's change in enthalpy equals the energy released in the reaction, including the energy retained in the system and lost through expansion against its surroundings. In a similar manner, for an endothermic reaction, the system's change in enthalpy is equal to the energy absorbed in the reaction, including the energy lost by the system and gained from compression from its surroundings. If ΔH is positive, the reaction is endothermic, that is heat is absorbed by the system due to the products of the reaction having a greater enthalpy than the reactants. On the other hand, if ΔH is negative, the reaction is exothermic, that is the overall decrease in enthalpy is achieved by the generation of heat.
From the definition of enthalpy as

{\displaystyle H=U+pV,}
, the enthalpy change at constant pressure

{\displaystyle \Delta H=\Delta U+p\Delta V.}
However for most chemical reactions, the work term



p

{\displaystyle p\Delta V}
is much smaller than the internal energy change



Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta U}
which is approximately equal to



Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta H.}
As an example, for the combustion of carbon monoxide 2 CO(g) + O2(g) → 2 CO2(g),



Δ
H


{\displaystyle \Delta H}
= –566.0 kJ and



Δ
U


{\displaystyle \Delta U}
= –563.5 kJ. Since the differences are so small, reaction enthalpies are often loosely described as reaction energies and analyzed in terms of bond energies.
