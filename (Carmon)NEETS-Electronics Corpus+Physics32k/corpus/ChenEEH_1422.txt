Villasenor et al. (1996) have implemented an automatic
target recognition system using the Xilinx 4000 series FPGAs.
Even though the Xilinx 4000 FPGA is not partially reconﬁgur-
able, the group was able to achieve an order of magnitude
increase in performance over systems built using general pur-
pose processors. In addition, over 75% of the total execution
time of their application was spent in reconﬁguring the FPGA.
This signiﬁcant reconﬁguration overhead can be reduced if a
partially reconﬁgurable FPGA is used.
