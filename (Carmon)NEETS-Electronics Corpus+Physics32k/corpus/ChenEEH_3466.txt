Protecting substation busses is a very important task because
operation of the entire substation depends on availability of
the busses. The bus faults are rare, but in the open-air substa-
tions, they occasionally happen. They have to be cleared very
fast due to high-fault current ﬂow that can damage the bus.
This section brieﬂy discusses the requirements and basic prin-
ciples used for bus protection. Detailed treatment of the sub-
ject is given in several classical references (Horowitz and
Phadke, 1992; Blackburn, 1998; Ungrad et al., 1995).
