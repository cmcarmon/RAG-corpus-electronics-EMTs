Therefore, equation 13.44 is equivalent to the update rule
for the critic network given in equations 13.4 to 13.6. From
this viewpoint, the online critic network update rule of equa-
tions 13.4 to 13.6 is actually converging to a (local) minimum
of the residual square of the equation of the principle of
optimality in a statistical average sense.
