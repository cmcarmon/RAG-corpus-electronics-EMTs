In  analog  electronics,  to  buffer  means  to  preserve  the  content  of  a  low  power 
signal and convert it to a higher power signal via a buffer amplifier. This is a frequent 
operation  in  analog  electronics  since  low  power  signals  can  be  more  easily  interfered 
with  than  high  power  signals,  but  often  only  low  power  signals  are  available  from 
electronic sensors.
