Direct record electronics record input signals onto magnetic media just as the signals appeared at the
recorder’s input. The only processing an input signal receives is the adding of a bias signal. The added
bias signal makes sure the signal stays away from the steps of the magnetism curve. Figure 5-1 shows a
basic block diagram of a recorder’s direct record electronics.
