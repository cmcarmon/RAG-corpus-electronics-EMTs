We see that
simplify the
function but shifted zeros of the original function into new
positions. Normally, if no other conditions are imposed, we
would always remove the full value because then the resulting
number of elements is minimal. Partial removal is used in
the synthesis of two-port networks, as is shown later in this
chapter.
