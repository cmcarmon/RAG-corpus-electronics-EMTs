Landau damping occurs because of the energy exchange between an electromagnetic wave with phase velocity




v

p
h




{\displaystyle v_{ph}}
and particles in the plasma with velocity approximately equal to




v

p
h




{\displaystyle v_{ph}}
, which can interact strongly with the wave. Those particles having velocities slightly less than




v

p
h




{\displaystyle v_{ph}}
will be accelerated by the electric field of the wave to move with the wave phase velocity, while those particles with velocities slightly greater than




v

p
h




{\displaystyle v_{ph}}
will be decelerated losing energy to the wave: particles tend to synchronize with the wave. This is proved experimentally with a Traveling-wave tube.

In a collisionless plasma the particle velocities are often taken to be approximately a Maxwellian distribution function. If the slope of the function is negative, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is greater than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles gaining energy from the wave than losing to the wave, which leads to wave damping. If, however, the slope of the function is positive, the number of particles with velocities slightly less than the wave phase velocity is smaller than the number of particles with velocities slightly greater. Hence, there are more particles losing energy to the wave than gaining from the wave, which leads to a resultant increase in the wave energy.
