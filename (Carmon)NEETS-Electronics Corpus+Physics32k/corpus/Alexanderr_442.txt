4. Attempt. The given circuit is drawn using Schematics as in
Fig. 8.36. The pulse is speciﬁed using VPWL voltage source,
but VPULSE could be used instead. Using the piecewise linear
function, we set the attributes of VPWL as 
T2 ⫽ 0.001,
Two voltage markers are inserted to plot the input and output
voltages. Once the circuit is drawn and the attributes are set,
we select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient
Analysis dialog box. As a parallel RLC circuit, the roots of the
characteristic equation are 
Thus, we may set Final
Time as 4 s (four times the magnitude of the lower root). When
