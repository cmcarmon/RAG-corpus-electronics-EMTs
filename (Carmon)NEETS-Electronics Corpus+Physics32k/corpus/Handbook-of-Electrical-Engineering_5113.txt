Faraday  rotation: First-order  isotropic  nonreciprocal  magnetooptic  effect  which  causes  the  polarization
direction of a linearly polarized transmitted light to rotate when the propagation direction of the incident
light wave is parallel to the direction of the applied magnetization of the magnetooptic medium. It is
also known as magnetic circular birefringence (MCB).
