Crystals work because of something called the piezoelectric effect: If you 
apply a voltage in just the right way across a quartz crystal, it vibrates at a 
specific frequency, known as the resonant frequency. If you then remove the 
applied voltage, the crystal continues to vibrate until it settles back to its pre-
vious shape. As it vibrates, it generates a voltage at the resonant frequency.
