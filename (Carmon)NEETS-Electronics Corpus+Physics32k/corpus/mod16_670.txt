Dashed line CH 1 is the output of one channel, while line CH 2 is the output of the other. The trace
moves from left to right because of the sawtooth waveform applied to the horizontal plates. A more
detailed analysis shows that the beam moves from CH 1 to CH 2 while the gate is connected to the output
from one channel. Then, when the gate samples the output of the CH 2 during time 3 to 4, the beam is at a
different vertical LOCATION. (This is assuming that CH 2 is at a different voltage reference.) The beam
continues in the sequence 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, and 11 to 12 through the rest of one horizontal sweep.
