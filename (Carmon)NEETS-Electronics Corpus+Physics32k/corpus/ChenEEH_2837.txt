Advances in FDTD computational techniques for solving
Maxwell’s equations have provided the basis for modeling
both linear and nonlinear dispersions over ultrawide band-
widths. An example of the possibilities for such modeling is
shown in Figure 9.20, which is a sequence of snapshot visual-
izations of the dynamics of a potential femtosecond all-optical
switch. This switch uses the collision and subsequent ‘‘bounc-
ing’’ of pulsed optical spatial solitons, which are pulsed beams
of laser light that are prevented from spreading in their trans-
verse directions by the optical focusing effect of the nonlinear
material in which they propagate.
