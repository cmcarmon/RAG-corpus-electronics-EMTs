Light  travels  at  186,000  miles  per  second,  or 
30,000,000,000 centimeters per second, through a 
 vacuum. The velocity is reduced as it passes through 
 various types of mediums. The frequency range of light is 
300 to 300,000,000 gigahertz (giga 5 1,000,000,000). Of 
this frequency range, only a small band is visible to the 
human eye. The visible region spans from approximately 
400,000 to 750,000 gigahertz. Infrared light falls below 
400,000 gigahertz, and ultraviolet light lies above 750,000 
gigahertz. Light waves at the upper end of the frequency 
range have more energy than light waves at the lower end.
