original system within a given stability margin. SMC was then
designed based on the delay-free system. Asymptotic stability is
ensured for both the delay-free system and the original delayed
system in the case of bounded and matched disturbance for the
designed control law. The control design method was applied to
the IC engine idle speed control problem, not for stabilization
(because the engine is stable itself during idling) but for com-
pensation with the effects of the delay.
