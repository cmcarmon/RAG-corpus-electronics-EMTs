. Session control: All the session control functionalities
can be satisﬁed using a combination of RTP, RTCP, and
RTSP. Real-Time Protocol (RTP) (Schulzrinne et al.,
1996) typically runs on top of UDP. Speciﬁcally, chunks
of audio/video data that are generated by the sending side
of the multimedia application are encapsulated in RTP
packets, which in turn are encapsulated in UDP. The RTP
functionality needs to be integrated into the application.
The functions provided by RTP include (a) sequence
number ﬁeld in the RTP header to detect lost packets,
(b) a payload identiﬁer included in each RTP packet to
dynamically change and describe the encoding of the
media, (c) a frame market bit to indicate the beginning
and end of a video or audio frame, (d) a synchronization
source (SSRC) identiﬁer to determine the originator of
the frame because there are many participants in a multi-
cast session and (e) time stamp to compensate for the
different delay jitter for packets in the same stream, and
to assist the play-out buffers.
