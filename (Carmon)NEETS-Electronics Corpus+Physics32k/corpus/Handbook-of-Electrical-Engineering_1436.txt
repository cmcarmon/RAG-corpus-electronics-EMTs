In addition to pitch and voicing estimation, a smooth log magnitude function may be obtained by windowing
or “liftering” the cepstrum to eliminate the terms which contain the pitch information. Figure 15.14 is one such
smoothed spectrum. It was obtained from the DFT of the cepstrum of Fig. 15.13 after ﬁrst setting all terms of
the cepstrum to zero except for the ﬁrst 16.
