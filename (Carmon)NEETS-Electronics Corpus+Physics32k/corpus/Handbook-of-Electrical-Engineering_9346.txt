Graphics  has  emerged  as  the  vehicle  for  visualizing  physical  phenomena  and  the  volume  visualization  of
complex datasets [Purgathofer and Schonhut, 1989; Vince, 1990; Kaufmen et al., 1996]. Some examples include
the medical modeling of the anatomy and MRIs [Kaufmen et al., 1996]. One application simulates laboratory
testing of a new friction material for disc brakes and visualizes temperature distribution of the brakes’ ability
to conduct or absorb heat [Purgathofer and Schonhut, 1989]. In mathematics, B. B. Mandelbrot deﬁned the
. Fractals, geometrical self-similar objects with fractional dimension, form a powerful tool
geometry of 
for generating objects that resemble natural phenomena such as mountains, trees, and coastlines [de Ruiter,
1988; Mandelbrot, 1982].
