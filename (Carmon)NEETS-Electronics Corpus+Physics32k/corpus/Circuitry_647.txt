and  the  effect  that  it  might  have  on  the  circuit 
under  investigation.  When  fault  finding,  it  is 
interpretation  that  is  put  on  the  meter  readings 
rather than the indications themselves. 
  Figures  14.2(a)  and  14.2(b)  respectively  show 
the  circuit  of  a  simple  voltmeter  and  a  simple 
ammeter. Each instrument is based on the moving 
coil  indicator  shown  in  Fig.  14.1.  The  voltmeter 
consists of a multiplier resistor connected in series 
with  the  basic  moving  coil  movement  whilst  the 
ammeter consists of a  shunt  resistor connected in 
parallel  with  the  basic  moving  coil  instrument. 
When determining the value of multiplier or shunt 
resistance (Rm and Rs respectively in Fig. 14.2) it is 
important to remember that the coil of the moving 
coil  meter  also  has  a  resistance.  We  have  shown 
this as a resistor, r, connected with the moving coil 
in Fig. 14.3. In both cases, the current required to 
produce 
the  meter 
movement is Im.
