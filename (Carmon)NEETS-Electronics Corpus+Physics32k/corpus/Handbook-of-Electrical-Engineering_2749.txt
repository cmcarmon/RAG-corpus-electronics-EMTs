H. Physical  Design  at Transistor/Cell  Level: As  the  above  steps  are  completed,  the  design  is  moving  closer
toward  a  full  deÔ¨Ånition  of  the  ASIC  circuit  in  terms  of  a  set  of  physical  masks  precisely  specifying
placement of all the transistors and interconnections. In this step, that process is completed.
