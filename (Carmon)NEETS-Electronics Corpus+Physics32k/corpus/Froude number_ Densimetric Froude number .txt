When used in the context of the Boussinesq approximation the densimetric Froude number is defined as

u

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Fr} ={\frac {u}{\sqrt {g'h}}}}

where g′ is the reduced gravity:

{\displaystyle g'=g{\frac {\rho _{1}-\rho _{2}}{\rho _{1}}}}

The densimetric Froude number is usually preferred by modellers who wish to nondimensionalize a speed preference to the Richardson number which is more commonly encountered when considering stratified shear layers. For example, the leading edge of a gravity current moves with a front Froude number of about unity.
