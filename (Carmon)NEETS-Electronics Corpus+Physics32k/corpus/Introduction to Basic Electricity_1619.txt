The wirewound resistor is constructed of a nickel‑
chromium alloy (nichrome) wire wound on a ceramic 
form (Figure 13‑7). Leads are attached and the entire 
resistor is sealed with a coating. Wirewound resistors 
are used in high‑current circuits where precision is 
necessary. The resistance range varies from a fraction 
of an ohm to several thousand ohms.
