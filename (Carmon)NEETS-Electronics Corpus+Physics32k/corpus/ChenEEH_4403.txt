where kuk2 is the norm of the vector signal and ku(t)k is the
Euclidean norm of a vector in Rp. To pose and solve opti-
mal control problems, it is useful to consider the most general
set of energy signals. The desired set is the Lebesgue space
of all square integrable functions. This set is denoted by
L2þ ¼ L2[0, 1). For convenience, the spatial dimension of
vectors with entries in L2þ will not be included. A useful
measure of the size of the transfer function matrix is the
induced system gain. If the system is represented by the map-
ping G:L2 ! L2, then the induced system gain is as follows:
