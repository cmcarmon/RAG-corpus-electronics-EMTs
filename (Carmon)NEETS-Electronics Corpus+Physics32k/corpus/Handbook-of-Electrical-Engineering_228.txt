How Does the Presence of Controlled Sources Affect Circuit Analysis?
The presence of nonreciprocal elements, which are modeled by controlled sources, affects the analysis of the
circuit.  Simple  circuits  may  be  analyzed  through  the  direct  application  of  Kirchhoff ’s  laws  to  branch  circuit
variables. Controlled sources enter this process similar to the constitutive relations deﬁning R,  L, and  C, i.e.,
in deﬁning relationships between branch circuit variables. Thus, controlled sources add no complexity to this
basic technique.
