Capacitors come in many types and styles to meet 
the needs of the electronics industry. electrolytic	
capacitors offer large capacitance for small size and 
weight (Figure 20-3). Electrolytic capacitors consist of 
two metal foils separated by fine gauze or other absor-
bent material that is saturated with a chemical paste 
called an electrolyte. The electrolyte is a good conduc-
tor and serves as part of the negative plate. The dielec-
tric is formed by oxidation of the positive plate. The 
oxidized layer is thin and a good insulator. An electro-
lytic capacitor is polarized, having positive and nega-
tive leads. Polarity must be observed when connecting 
an electrolytic capacitor in a circuit.
