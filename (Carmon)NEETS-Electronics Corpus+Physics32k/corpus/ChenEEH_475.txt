The lateral outdiffusion of the emitter doping forms the emit-
ter periphery junction with an associated depletion capaci-
tance CjEp. In addition, a portion of the base current, IjBEp,
coming from the base contact is back-injected into the emitter
already across the peripheral
junction. Electrons injected
across the emitter periphery junction pass through the external
base region under the BE spacer before they enter the exter-
nal BC depletion region (refer to Figure 5.5). The associated
carrier transport and charge storage lead to a perimeter trans-
fer current ITp and a corresponding diffusion capacitance.
Therefore, in most cases, the emitter periphery acts like a
second transistor almost
to the internal one
but with lower performance. To avoid a two-transistor
model, one can combine ITi and ITp into a single transfer
current source, IT ¼ ITi þ ITp ¼ I TiAE0 þ I0
