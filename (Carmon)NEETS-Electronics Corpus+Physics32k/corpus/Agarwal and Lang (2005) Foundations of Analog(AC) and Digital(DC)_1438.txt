Figure 10.24 depicts graphically the wire connecting the two inverters on the VLSI chip.
Assume the wire is of length L and width W. The MOSFETs have gate lengths Lg and
gate widths Wg. Since the length of the wire is significant, we need to model it carefully.
Let the wire resistance be denoted Rwire and the wire capacitance Cwire. The circuit
model for the inverter pair taking into account wire parasitics is shown in Figure 10.25.
