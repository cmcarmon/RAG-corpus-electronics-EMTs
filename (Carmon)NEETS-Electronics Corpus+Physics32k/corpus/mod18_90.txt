Maximum range is influenced by pulse width and pulse repetition frequency (prf). Since a target can
reflect only a very small part of the transmitted power, the greater the transmitted power, the greater the
strength of the echo that could be received. Thus, a transmitted pulse should quickly rise to its maximum
amplitude, remain at this amplitude for the duration of the desired pulse width, and decay instantaneously
to zero. Figure 1-12 illustrates the effects of pulse shapes.
