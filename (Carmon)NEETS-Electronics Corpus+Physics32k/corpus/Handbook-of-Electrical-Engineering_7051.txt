Since [H(X1, X2, . . ., Xn)]/n Ô¨ÅH(X), we can get arbitrarily close to the entropy rate by using longer and longer
block lengths. Thus, the entropy rate is the fundamental limit for data compression for stationary sources, and
we can achieve rates arbitrarily close to this limit by using long blocks.
