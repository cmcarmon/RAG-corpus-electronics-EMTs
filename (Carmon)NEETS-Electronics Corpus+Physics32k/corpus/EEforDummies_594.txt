Transistors are the heart of nearly every electronic 
device in the world, quietly working away without 
taking up much space, generating a lot of heat, or 
breaking down every so often. Generally regarded 
as the most important technological innovation of 
the 20th century, transistors were developed as an 
alternative to the vacuum tube, which drove the 
development of electronic systems ranging from 
radio broadcasting to computers but exhibited 
some undesirable characteristics. The solid‐state 
transistor enabled the miniaturization of electronics, 
leading to the development of cellphones, iPods, GPS 
systems, implantable pacemakers — and much more.
