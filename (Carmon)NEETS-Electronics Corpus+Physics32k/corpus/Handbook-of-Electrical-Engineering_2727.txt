We  would  like  to  ﬁnd  a  minimal-crossing  path  from  source  cell  A
(cell 2)  to  destination  cell  B  (cell  24).  (The  minimal-crossing  path  is
deﬁned as a path that crosses over the fewest number of existing paths.)
The algorithm begins by assigning the start cell 2 to a list, denoted as L,
i.e., L consists of the single entry {2}. For each entry in L, its immediate
neighbors (which are not blocked) will be added to an auxiliary list L¢.
(The auxiliary cell list L¢ is provided for momentary storage of names of
cells.) Therefore, list L¢ contains entries {1,3}. To these cells a chain coor-
dinate and a weight are assigned, as denoted in Fig. 25.21. For example,
in cell 3, we have the pair (0, ﬁ), meaning that the chain coordinate is
toward right and the cell weight is 0. The weight for a cell represents the
number of wires that should be crossed in order to reach that cell from
the source cell. The cells with minimum weight in list L¢ are appended
