In single-domain materials, the magnetic particles are so small that reversal of the magnetization can only
occur by rotation of the magnetization vector. This rotation can be resisted by combinations of three anisotro-
pies: crystalline anisotropy, shape anisotropy, and magnetoelastic anisotropy (which depends on the magneto-
strictive properties of the material).
