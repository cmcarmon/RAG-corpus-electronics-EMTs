FREQUENCY CUTOFFÂ—The frequency at which the filter circuit changes from an action of rejecting the 
unwanted frequencies to an action of passing the desired frequencies. Conversely, the point at which the 
filter circuit changes from an action in which it passes the desired frequencies to an action in which it 
rejects the undesired frequencies [9].
