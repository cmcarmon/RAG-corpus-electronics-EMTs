Major computer companies, telecommunications manufacturers, defense contractors, and some software ven-
dors have been measuring defect removal efﬁciencies for more than 20 years. The body of empirical data is large
enough to make general observations about the efﬁciencies of many different kinds of defect removal operation.
Empirical observations and long-range studies of commercial software have demonstrated that most forms
of testing are less than 30% efﬁcient. That is, any given stage of testing such as system testing or acceptance
testing is likely to ﬁnd less than 30% of the latent defects that are actually present. However, a carefully planned
series of defect removal operations can achieve very respectable levels of cumulative defect removal efﬁciency.
Computer manufacturers, commercial software producers, and defense software producers may utilize as many
as 9 to 20 consecutive defect removal operations, and sometimes achieve cumulative defect removal efﬁciencies
that approach the six sigma quality level, i.e., defect removal efﬁciency rates approaching 99.999999%.
