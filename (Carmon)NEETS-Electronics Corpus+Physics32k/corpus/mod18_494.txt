For radar applications, a low vswr is desired for the following reasons: (1) Reflections in the 
transmission line cause improper transmitter operation and can result in faulty pulsing (this effect is most 
pronounced when the line is long, as compared with a wavelength of the transmitted energy); (2) arc-over 
may occur at the maximum voltage points; and (3) hot spots can occur in the transmission line and cause 
mechanical breakdown. Since transmission lines for radar equipment are normally coaxial cables or 
waveguides, slotted lines or directional couplers must be used for standing-wave measurements.
