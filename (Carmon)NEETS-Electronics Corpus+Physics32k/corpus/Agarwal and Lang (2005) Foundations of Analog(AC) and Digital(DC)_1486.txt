The use of a clock discipline represents an instance of time discretization.
Lumping of time into invalid periods and valid periods gives us the clocked
digital abstraction and significantly simplifies the orchestrating of communica-
tion between individual circuit modules. Lumping occurs because we do not
care about the precise moment when a signal is sampled, provided, of course,
the signal is sampled within the valid period.
