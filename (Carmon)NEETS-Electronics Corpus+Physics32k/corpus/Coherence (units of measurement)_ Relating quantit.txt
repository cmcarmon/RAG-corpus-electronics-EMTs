Non-commensurable quantities have different physical dimensions which means that adding or subtracting them is not meaningful. For instance, adding the mass of an object to its volume has no physical meaning. However, new quantities (and, as such, units) can be derived via multiplication and exponentiation of other units. As an example, the SI unit for force is the newton, which is defined as kg·m·s−2. Since a coherent derived unit is one which is defined by means of multiplication and exponentiation of other units but not multiplied by any scaling factor, the pascal is a coherent unit of pressure (defined as kg·m−1·s−2), but the bar (defined as 100000 kg·m−1·s−2) is not.
Note that coherence of a given unit depends on the definition of the base units. Should the meter's definition change such that it is shorter by a factor of 100000, then the bar would be a coherent derived unit. However, a coherent unit remains coherent (and a non-coherent unit remains non-coherent) if the base units are redefined in terms of other units with the numerical factor always being unity.
