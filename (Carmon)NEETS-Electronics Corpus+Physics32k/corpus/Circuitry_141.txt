Solution 
 
In order to solve the circuit shown in Fig. 3.5, it is 
first necessary to mark the currents and voltages on 
the circuit, as shown in Figs 3.6 and 3.7. 
  By applying Kirchhoff’s Current Law at Node A 
that we’ve identified in Fig. 3.5: 
 
+I1 + I2 4I3 = 0
Therefore: 
 
I1 = I3 4I2 = 0
