In terms of its application, the distribution of HDM could also help explain how clusters and superclusters of galaxies formed after the Big Bang. Theorists claim that there exist two classes of dark matter: 1) those that "congregate around individual members of a cluster of visible galaxies" and 2) those that encompass "the clusters as a whole." Because CDM possesses a lower velocity, it could be the source of "smaller, galaxy-sized lumps," as shown in the image. HDM, then, should correspond to the formation of larger mass aggregates that surround whole galaxy clusters. However, data from the cosmic microwave background radiation, as measured by the COBE satellite, is highly uniform, and such high-velocity HDM particles cannot form clumps as small as galaxies beginning from such a smooth initial state, highlighting a discrepancy in what dark matter theory and the actual data are saying. Theoretically, in order to explain relatively small-scale structures in the observable Universe, it is necessary to invoke CDM or WDM. In other words, HDM being the sole substance in explaining cosmic galaxy formation is no longer viable, placing HDM under the larger umbrella of mixed dark matter (MDM) theory.
