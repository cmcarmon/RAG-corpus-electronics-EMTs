Electric generators are devices that convert energy from a mechanical form to an electrical form. This process,

known as electromechanical energy conversion, involves magnetic Ô¨Åelds that act as an intermediate 
There are two types of generators: alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc). This section explains how
these devices work and how they are modeled in analytical or numerical studies.
