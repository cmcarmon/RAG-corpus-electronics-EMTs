If our perfect (ideal) circuit has zero resistance, and a typical circuit has "some" resistance, then a 
circuit with a very small resistance is closer to being perfect than one that has a large resistance. Let's list 
what happens in a series-resonant circuit because resistance is present. This is not new to you - just a 
review of what you have learned previously.
