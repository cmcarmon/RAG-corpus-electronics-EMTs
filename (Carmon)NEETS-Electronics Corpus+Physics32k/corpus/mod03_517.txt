If you suspect that a solenoid is not working properly, the first step in troubleshooting it is a good
visual inspection. Check the connections for poor soldering, loose connections, or broken wires. The
plunger should be checked for cleanliness, binding, mechanical failure, and improper alignment. The
mechanism that the solenoid is connected to (actuates) should also be checked for proper operation.
