Generally a rotational device. A ratio of magnetic pole pairs, where the least number rotates at a higher rate than the higher number pole pair. An intermediate ferromagnetic pole "stator" is usually held stationary and used to effect the concentration of the magnetic lines of force between the high speed rotor and the low speed rotor. The ratio of High speed to Low Speed is the number of magnetic pole pairs on the high speed rotor to the number of magnetic pole pairs on the low speed rotor. This implies an even number of magnets on both rotors. The Ferromagnetic stator has two alternative solutions. The first being the sum of the number of pole pairs of the two rotors, giving the opposite direction of rotation, and the second having pole pieces numbering the difference between the pole pairs of the rotors, which results in the direction of rotation being the same.
