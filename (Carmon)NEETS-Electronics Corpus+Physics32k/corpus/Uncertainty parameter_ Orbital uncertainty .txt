Orbital uncertainty is related to several parameters used in the orbit determination process including the number of observations (measurements), the time spanned by those observations (observation arc), the quality of the observations (e.g. radar vs. optical), and the geometry of the observations. Of these parameters, the time spanned by the observations generally has the greatest effect on the orbital uncertainty.
Objects such as 1995 SN55 with a condition code (Uncertainty Parameter U) of E where the eccentricity is assumed are considered lost. 2010 GZ60 has an Uncertainty Parameter of 9, and could be an Earth threatening asteroid or may always remain beyond the asteroid belt.
