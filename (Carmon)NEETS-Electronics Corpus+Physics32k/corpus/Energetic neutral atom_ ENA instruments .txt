Although the study of ENAs promised improvements in the understanding of global magnetospheric and heliospheric processes, its progress was hindered due to initially enormous experimental difficulties.
In the late 1960s, the first direct ENA measurement attempts revealed the difficulties involved. ENA fluxes are very weak, sometimes less than 1 particle per cm2 per second and are typically detected by secondary electron emission upon contact with a solid surface. They exist in regions containing ultraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation at fluxes 100 times greater than produce similar emissions.

An ENA instrument ideally would also specifically:
prevent the entrance of charged particles
suppress background light (photons), particularly UV and EUV radiation
measure mass and energy of incoming ENAs
determine trajectories of incoming ENAs
measure ENA fluxes from 10âˆ’3 to 105 per cm2 per steradian per second
measure ENAs ranging in energy from a few eV up to >100 keV
The challenge to remote sensing via ENAs lies in combining mass spectrometry with the imaging of weak particle fluxes within the stringent limitations imposed by an application on a spacecraft.
