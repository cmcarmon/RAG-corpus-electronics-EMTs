Using an electrical meter safely and efﬁciently is perhaps the most valuable skill an electronics
technician can master, both for the sake of their own personal safety and for proﬁciency at
their trade. It can be daunting at ﬁrst to use a meter, knowing that you are connecting it to
live circuits which may harbor life-threatening levels of voltage and current. This concern is
not unfounded, and it is always best to proceed cautiously when using meters. Carelessness
more than any other factor is what causes experienced technicians to have electrical accidents.
The most common piece of electrical test equipment is a meter called the multimeter. Multi-
meters are so named because they have the ability to measure a multiple of variables: voltage,
current, resistance, and often many others, some of which cannot be explained here due to their
complexity. In the hands of a trained technician, the multimeter is both an efﬁcient work tool
and a safety device. In the hands of someone ignorant and/or careless, however, the multimeter
may become a source of danger when connected to a ”live” circuit.
