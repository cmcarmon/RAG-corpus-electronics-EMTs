Approximately 120 manufacturers of pulsation dampers provide items which do not damp. The authority for saying this is, because the words dampen and dampener have at their root, removing energy.How the word misuse has arisen
The compressibility of a gas, often nitrogen because it is inert at normal temperatures, stores any sudden volume change. Storing sudden volume change enables volume to change against a soft gas cushion, without the need to accelerate all the existing liquid in the system out of the way of the new volume coming from a pump. Therefore, as all the volume in a system does not have to be suddenly accelerated, the cushion is preventing "acceleration head (force)" having to be generated. The pressure pulse is accordingly not generated in the first place, so it is not damped at all. The gas cushion simply allows volume change to be stored. The manufacturers are providing, are liquid accumulators, not an item which removes energy.
