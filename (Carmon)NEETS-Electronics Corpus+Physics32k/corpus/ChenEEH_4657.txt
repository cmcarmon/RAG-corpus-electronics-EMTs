This chapter describes two recently developed theoretical
results, extensions to the existing theory highlighted in the
previous paragraphs for SMC based on Li and Yurkovich
(2000, 2001). In the ﬁrst technique (Li and Yurkovich, 2001),
where SMC is extended for a class of point-delayed systems, a
linear transformation is applied to convert the delayed system
to a delay-free system whose spectra embed all the unstable
poles of the original system with a given stability margin. It
can be proven that the delayed system is asymptotically stable
with SMC, based on the delay-free system. In the second ap-
proach, an adaptive SMC design method for discrete nonlinear
systems, where explicit knowledge of the system dynamics is not
available, is developed. A three layer feed-forward neural net-
work is used as a function approximator for the unknown
dynamics. The control law is designed based on the outputs of
the approximators, and the sliding surface is deﬁned in terms of
a stable polynomial of the system outputs.
