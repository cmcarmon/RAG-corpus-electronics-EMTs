There  are  numerous  possibilities  for  connection  of  hosts  to ATM  networks,  but  they  all  share  a  common
architecture, which consists of three sublayers: the ATM adaption layer (AAL), the ATM layer, and the physical
media-dependent (PMD) layer. Connection of hosts to ATM at a given layer is achieved through developing
an AAL for the layer in question. For example, one might decide to adapt to ATM at the network layer. In that
case,  the  transport  layer  would  operate  as  usual,  and  the AAL  would  be  designed  to  process  data  structures
from the transport layer to produce data structures for use by the ATM layer and vice versa. Of course, all hosts
communicating with each other in this way would use the same AAL.
