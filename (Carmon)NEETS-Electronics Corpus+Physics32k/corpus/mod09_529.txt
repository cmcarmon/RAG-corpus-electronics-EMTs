SERIES-NEGATIVE LIMITER WITH BIAS.—View (A) of figure 4-7 shows a series-negative 
limiter with negative bias. The diode is forward biased and conducts with no input signal. In view (B) it 
will continue to conduct as the input signal swings first positive and then negative (but only to −5 volts) 
from T0 through T1. At T1 the input becomes negative with respect to the −5 volt battery bias. The diode 
becomes reverse biased and is cutoff until T2 when the anode again becomes positive with respect to the 
battery voltage (−5 volts) on the cathode. No voltage is developed in the output by R1 (no current flow) 
and the output is held at −5 volts from T1 to T2. With negative bias applied to a series-negative limiter, 
only a portion of the negative signal is limited.
