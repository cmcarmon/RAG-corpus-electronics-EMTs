FIGURE 6.7 Noise Model for a Receiving Antenna. (A) This noise-equivalent circuit of an antenna shows noise voltage vnr received through
radiation and vnl produced by the antenna itself due to material-loss resistance Rloss. (B) The antenna is placed in a closed ‘‘perfectly absorbing’’
chamber at temperature T 0K (pdn ¼ noise power per unit solid angle, as seen by an ideal isotropic antenna).
