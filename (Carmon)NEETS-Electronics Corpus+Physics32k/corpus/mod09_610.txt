The amount of integration is dependent upon the values of R and C. The amount of integration may 
also be dependent upon the time constant of the circuit. The time constant of the circuit should be at least 
10 TIMES GREATER than the time duration of the input pulse for integration to occur. The value of 10 
is only an approximation. When the time constant of the circuit is 10 or more times the value of the 
duration of the input pulse, the circuit is said to possess a long time constant. When the time constant is 
long, the capacitor does not have the ability to charge instantly to the value of the applied voltage. 
Therefore, the result is the long, sloping, integrated waveform.
