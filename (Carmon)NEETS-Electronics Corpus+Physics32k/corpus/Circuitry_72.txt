Resistors 
 
The  notion  of  resistance  as  opposition  to  current 
was  discussed 
chapter. 
Conventional forms of resistor obey a straight line 
law  when  voltage  is  plotted  against  current  (see 
Fig.  2.1)  and  this  allows  us  to  use  resistors  as  a 
means  of  converting  current  into  a  corresponding 
voltage drop, and vice versa (note that doubling the 
applied  current  will  produce  double  the  voltage 
drop,  and  so  on).  Therefore  resistors  provide  us 
with  a  means  of  controlling  the  currents  and 
voltages  present  in  electronic  circuits.  They  can 
also  act  as  loads  to  simulate  the  presence  of  a 
circuit  during  testing  (e.g.  a  suitably  rated  resistor
