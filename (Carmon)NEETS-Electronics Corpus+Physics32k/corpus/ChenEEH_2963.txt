Due to their low cost and reliable performance, Si BJTs are
found in many applications below 4 GHz. Packaged low-power
(general purpose), medium-power, and low-noise BJTs are
available from many manufacturers. Power versions are also
available. Figures of merit for microwave BJTs are fT and fmax.
In terms of the equivalent circuit model, these are given by:
