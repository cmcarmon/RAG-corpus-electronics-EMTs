The primary system is made up of circuits known as primary
feeders or distribution feeders. A feeder includes the main or
main feeder (which usually is a three-phase four-wire circuit)
and branches or laterals (which usually are single-phase or
three-phase circuits) tapped off the main, as shown in Figure
6.3. A feeder is usually sectioned by means of reclosing devices
at various locations to remove as little as possible of a faulted
circuit and hinder service to as few consumers as possible. This
is accomplished through the coordination of all the fuses and
reclosers.
