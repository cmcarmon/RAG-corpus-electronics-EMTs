As in a conventional receiver, each channel of the monopulse receiver converts the return echo to an
IF frequency by mixing the returned signal with a common local oscillator signal. The sum of the energy
from all four return signals is mixed with the local oscillator signal to produce range IF information.
Bearing information is obtained by subtracting the energy from horns B and D from the energy from
horns A and C:
