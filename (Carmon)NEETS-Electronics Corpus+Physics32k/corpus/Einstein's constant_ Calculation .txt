In the following, the value of Einstein's constant will be calculated. To do so, at the beginning a field equation where the cosmological constant Î› is equal to zero is taken, with a steady state hypothesis. Then we use the Newtonian approximation with hypothesis of a weak field and low velocities with respect to the speed of light.
The Newton law will arise and its corollary Poisson's equation.
In this approximation, Poisson's equation appears as the approached form of the field equation (or the field equation appears as a generalization of Poisson's equation). The identification gives the expression of Einstein's constant related to quantities G and c.
