Each test method describes the test equipment (input optics, mode filters, and cladding-mode
strippers) necessary for the test. Cutoff wavelength measurements require an overfilled launch over the
full range of test wavelengths. Since the procedures for measuring the cutoff wavelength of uncabled and
cabled single mode fibers are essentially the same, only the test method for measuring the cutoff
wavelength of uncabled fiber is discussed.
