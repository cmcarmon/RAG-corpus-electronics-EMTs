In addition to audio broadcasts, satellite-based voice applications include point-to-point voice, multinode
interactive  voice,  and  voice  over  data VSATs.  Point-to-point  voice  is  most  prevalently  used  for  high-volume
voice  trunking  for  long-distance  connectivity  or  transoceanic  connectivity.  A  multinode,  interactive  voice
architecture is ideal in providing voice connectivity to remote locations that are not serviced by terrestrial voice
facilitates.  Both  mesh  and  star  conÔ¨Ågurations  are  used  to  provide  multinode  voice  connectivity.  Automated
satellite access control and resource allocation techniques are used to allow for granting requested on-demand
