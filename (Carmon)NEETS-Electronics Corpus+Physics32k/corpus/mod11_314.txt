The lens shown in figure 3-12 has an egg-crate appearance because it is really two lenses occupying 
the same volume. Vertical plates make up a lens that focuses a vertically polarized beam, and horizontal 
plates handle beams which are horizontally polarized. In other words, this type of construction can be 
used in multiple-beam applications where the polarization of the beams is different.
