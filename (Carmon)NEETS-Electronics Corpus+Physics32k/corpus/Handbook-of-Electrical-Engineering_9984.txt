1. the variable gain, K, having the same sinusoidal input as the nonlinearity, which minimizes the mean
squared value of the error between the output from the nonlinearity and that from the variable gain, and 
2. the covariance of the input sinusoid and the nonlinearity output divided by the variance of the input.
