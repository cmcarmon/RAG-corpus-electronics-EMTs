The EEG has its greatest value as an aid in the diagnosis and differentiation of the many types of epilepsy,
a condition in which groups of neurons in the brain become hyperexcitable and, depending on their location,
produce sensory, motor, and/or autonomic manifestations. The epilepsies associated with cortical lesions are
often detected by the scalp EEG. The EEG in epileptics is usually abnormal between, as well as during, attacks.
The EEG provides information on the location of the area (or areas) of abnormal neuronal activity.
