Suppose you place a strong permanent magnet in the center of a coil of wire 
connected as in Figure 8-3. (Note that the multimeter and the wire form a 
complete path.) If you move the magnet up, current is induced in the wire 
and flows in one direction. If you move the magnet down, current is also 
induced, but it flows in the other direction. By moving the magnet up and 
down repeatedly, you can produce an alternating current (AC) in the wire. 
Alternatively, you can move the wire up and down around the magnet, and 
the same thing will happen. As long as there is relative motion between the 
wire and the magnet, current will be induced in the wire.
