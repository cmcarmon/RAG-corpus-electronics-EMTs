When a particle is considered to have no mass or to have an infinitesimal charge, this can be described as saying that we deal with a probe and that back-reaction is neglected. However, a real object also carries (in general) a mass and a charge itself. These properties imply that the model of the original environment needs to be modified to reach self-consistency. For example, a particle can be described as helping to curve the space in general relativity. Taking into account the constraints implied on the model by the particle's properties – the back-reaction – is one way of reaching a more accurate model than if those constraints are ignored.
