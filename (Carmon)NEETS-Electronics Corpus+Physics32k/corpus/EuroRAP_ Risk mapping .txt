Based on real crash and traffic flow data, colour-coded maps show a road's safety performance by measuring and mapping the rate at which road users are being killed or seriously injured. Different maps can be produced depending on the target audience. These include:
Crashes per km
Crashes per km travelled
Crash costs per km and per km travelled
Potential crash savings per km and per km travelled
Risk is shown in colour-coded bandings from high (black), to low risk (green).
