Color Preference Index (CPI). The CPI is determined by a similar procedure to that used for the CRI. The
difference is that CPI recognizes the very real human ingredient of preference. This index is based on individual
preference for the coloration of certain identiÔ¨Åable objects, such as complexions, meat, vegetables, fruits, and
foliage,  to  be  slightly  different  than  the  colors  of  these  objects  in  daylight.  CPI  indicates  how  a  source  will
render color with respect to how we best appreciate and remember that color.
