With inﬁnite resistance between the test leads (open circuit), there will be no current
through coil 1, only through coils 2 and 3. When energized, these coils try to center them-
selves in the gap between the two magnet poles, driving the needle fully to the right of the
scale where it points to ”inﬁnity.”
