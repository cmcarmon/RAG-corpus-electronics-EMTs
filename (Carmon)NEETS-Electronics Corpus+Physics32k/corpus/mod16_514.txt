If the transistor is to be tested out of the circuit, plug it into the test jack located on the right-hand
side below the meter. If the transistor is to be tested in the circuit, at least 300 ohms must exist between E-
B (emitter to base), C-B (collector to base), and C-E (collector to emitter) for accurate measurement.
Initial setting of the test set controls is performed as follows:
