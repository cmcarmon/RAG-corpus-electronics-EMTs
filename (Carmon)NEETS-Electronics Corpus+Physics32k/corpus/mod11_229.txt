The difference (idler) frequency is reapplied to the varactor to increase the gain and to produce an 
output signal of the correct frequency. The 9-gigahertz idler frequency recombines with the 12-gigahertz 
pump signal and produces a 3-gigahertz difference signal that has a much larger amplitude than the 
original 3-gigahertz input signal. The amplified signal is sent to the ferrite circulator for transfer to the 
next stage.
