The mixer-amplifier feeds the pulses of rf energy to an intermediate power amplifier. This amplifier
stage is similar to the buffer-amplifier stage except that it is a pulsed amplifier. That is, the pulsed
amplifier has operating power only during the time the modulator pulse from the low-voltage modulator
is applied to the stage. The amplified output signal is fed to a second intermediate power amplifier that
operates in the same manner as the first.
