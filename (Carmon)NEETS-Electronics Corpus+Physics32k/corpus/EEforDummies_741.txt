Most op amps require both positive and negative supply voltages. A posi-
tive supply voltage, VCC, in the range of 8 to 12 V (connected to pin 7) and a 
negative supply voltage, –VCC, in the range of –8 to –12 V (connected to pin 
4) works. (If you’re looking for some light reading, you can find application 
notes on how to operate such dual‐supply op amps using a single power 
supply.)
