Note that in equations 5.97 and 5.98, the coefﬁcients Am and
Bm are dependent of each other, and their dependence can be
found by applying the proper boundary conditions. To ﬁnd the
propagating mode in the rod for a given radius of the rod, it is
necessary to write the ﬁeld expression outside the rod and
impose that this ﬁeld decays for increasing radius. Upon appli-
cation of this procedure, it is possible to determine an eigen-
value equation for the rod that gives a relationship between the
ﬁber parameters and the minimum radius of the rod capable of
supporting guided modes. The relationship is expressed as:
