Specifications of locomotives often include tractive effort curves, showing the relationship between tractive effort and velocity.

The shape of the graph is shown at right. The line AB shows operation at the maximum tractive effort, the line BC shows continuous tractive effort that is inversely proportional to speed (constant power).
Tractive effort curves often have graphs of rolling resistance superimposed on themâ€”the intersection of the rolling resistance graph and tractive effort graph gives the maximum velocity (when net tractive effort is zero).
