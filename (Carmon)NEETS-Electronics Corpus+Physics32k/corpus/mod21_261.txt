Terminations of 50 and 75 ohms are designed as either feedthrough, impedance-matching devices, or
as rf loading devices. They are precision resistors sealed in small plastic or metal enclosures and are
designed to be mounted on various rf connectors. In the case of feedthrough terminations, they are
designed with rf connectors at both ends, which allows the rf signal to pass through them. They are
impedance-matching devices designed primarily to reduce the voltage standing-wave ratio (vswr) that is
produced when two pieces of equipment with dissimilar impedances are connected together.
