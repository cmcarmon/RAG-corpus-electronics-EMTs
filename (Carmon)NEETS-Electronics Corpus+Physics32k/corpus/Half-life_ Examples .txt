There is a half-life describing any exponential-decay process. For example:
The current flowing through an RC circuit or RL circuit decays with a half-life of RCln(2) or ln(2)L/R, respectively. For this example, the term half time might be used instead of "half life", but they mean the same thing.
In a first-order chemical reaction, the half-life of the reactant is ln(2)/λ, where λ is the reaction rate constant.
In radioactive decay, the half-life is the length of time after which there is a 50% chance that an atom will have undergone nuclear decay. It varies depending on the atom type and isotope, and is usually determined experimentally. See List of nuclides.
The half life of a species is the time it takes for the concentration of the substance to fall to half of its initial value.
