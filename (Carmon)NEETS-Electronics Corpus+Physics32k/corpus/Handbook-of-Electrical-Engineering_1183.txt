Hilbert Space Setting
Much of the original research in signal restoration assumed that the underlying set of signals X is a complete
inner product (i.e., a Hilbert) space. An inner product space is a vector space upon which there is deﬁned an
inner product <x,y> which maps any two vectors x,y ˛  X into a scalar such that the axioms of an inner product
axiom are satisﬁed.3 This inner product induces a natural norm distance metric as speciﬁed by
