p r o b l e m 9.5 A constant voltage source having value V drives a time-varying
capacitor as shown in Figure 9.66. The time-varying capacitance is given by C(t) =
C0 + C1 sin(ωt). Determine the capacitor current i(t).
p r o b l e m 9.6 A constant current source having value I drives a time-varying
inductor as shown in Figure 9.67. The time-varying inductance is given by L(t) =
L0 + L1 sin(ωt). Determine the inductor voltage v(t).
p r o b l e m 9.7 Consider the parallel plate capacitor shown in Figure 9.68.
Assume that the dielectric is free space so that  = ◦.
