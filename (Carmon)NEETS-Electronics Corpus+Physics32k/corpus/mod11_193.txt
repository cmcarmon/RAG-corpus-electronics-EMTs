One of the prime causes of arcing is the release of gas from tube elements during idle periods. 
Arcing may also be caused by the presence of sharp surfaces within the tube, mode shifting, and by 
drawing excessive current. While the cathode can withstand considerable arcing for short periods of time, 
continued arcing will shorten the life of the magnetron and may destroy it entirely. Therefore, each time 
excessive arcing occurs, the tube must be baked in again until the arcing ceases and the tube is stabilized.
