When voltage sources are connected in series, KVL can be applied
to obtain the total voltage. The combined voltage is the algebraic sum
of the voltages of the individual sources. For example, for the voltage
sources  shown  in  Fig.  2.20(a),  the  combined  or  equivalent  voltage
source in Fig. 2.20(b) is obtained by applying KVL.
