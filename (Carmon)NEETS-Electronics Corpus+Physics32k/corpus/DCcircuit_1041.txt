Notice that the voltage and current ﬁgures for R2 (8 volts, 4 amps) are identical to those
found using other methods of analysis. Also notice that the voltage and current ﬁgures for the
Thevenin series resistance and the Thevenin source (total) do not apply to any component in
the original, complex circuit. Thevenin’s Theorem is only useful for determining what happens
to a single resistor in a network: the load.
