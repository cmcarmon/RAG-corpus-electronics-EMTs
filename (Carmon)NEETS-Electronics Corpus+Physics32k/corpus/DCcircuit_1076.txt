It is possible to calculate the proper values of resistors necessary to form one kind of net-
work (∆ or Y) that behaves identically to the other kind, as analyzed from the terminal con-
nections alone. That is, if we had two separate resistor networks, one ∆ and one Y, each with
its resistors hidden from view, with nothing but the three terminals (A, B, and C) exposed for
testing, the resistors could be sized for the two networks so that there would be no way to
electrically determine one network apart from the other. In other words, equivalent ∆ and Y
networks behave identically.
