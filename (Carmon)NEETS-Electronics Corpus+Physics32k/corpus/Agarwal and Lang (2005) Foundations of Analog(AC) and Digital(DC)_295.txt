For the circuit in Figure 2.25, there are four equations to solve for four
unknown branch variables. In general, a circuit having B branches will have 2B
unknown branch variables: B branch currents and B branch voltages. To find
these variables, 2B independent equations are required, B of which will come
from element laws, and B of which will come from the application of KVL and
KCL. Moreover, if the circuit has N nodes, then N−1 equations will come from
the application of KCL and B− N+ 1 equations will come from the application
of KVL.
