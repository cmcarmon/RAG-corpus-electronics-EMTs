Ideally, the output of most power supplies should be a constant voltage. Unfortunately, this is 
difficult to achieve. There are two factors that can cause the output voltage to change. First, the ac line 
voltage is not constant. The so-called 115 volts ac can vary from about 105 volts ac to 125 volts ac. This 
means that the peak ac voltage to which the rectifier responds can vary from about 148 volts to 177 volts. 
The ac line voltage alone can be responsible for nearly a 20 percent change in the dc output voltage. The 
second factor that can change the dc output voltage is a change in the load resistance. In complex 
electronic equipment, the load can change as circuits are switched in and out. In a television receiver, the 
load on a particular power supply may depend on the brightness of the screen, the control settings, or even 
the channel selected.
