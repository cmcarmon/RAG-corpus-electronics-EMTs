The curve of output voltage versus input voltage, Figure 15.3c, is nonlinear.
But we also observe that the device has very large voltage gain, defined as
vo/vi. We certainly would be willing to sacrifice substantial amounts of gain
in return for a corresponding improvement in linearity. Fortunately, the addition
of two resistors to the circuit results in precisely this trade-off. Figure 15.4 shows
one possible circuit configuration, and the resulting relation between vo and vi.
We will have more to say about this circuit in Section 15.3.1.
