Born  the  son  of  a  lawyer  in  Konigsberg,  East  Prussia,  Kirchhoff
entered the University of Konigsberg at age 18 and later became a lec-
turer  in  Berlin.  His  collaborative  work  in  spectroscopy  with  German
chemist  Robert  Bunsen  led  to  the  discovery  of  cesium  in  1860  and
rubidium in 1861. Kirchhoff was also credited with the Kirchhoff law
of radiation. Thus Kirchhoff is famous among engineers, chemists, and
physicists.
