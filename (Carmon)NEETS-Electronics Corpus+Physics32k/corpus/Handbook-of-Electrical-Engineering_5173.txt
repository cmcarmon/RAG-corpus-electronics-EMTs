Magnetostriction-Based Sensors
The use of metallic glass as a distributive magnetostrictive sensor has been studied. Typically, in the imbedded
smart  sensing  applications  using  the  magnetostrictive  property,  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  in  the  submicrogauss
regime,  and  the  nonlinearity  associated  with  the  hysteresis  of  magnetostriction  provides  a  detectable  sensor
signal. Pressure and force, which cause static or quasi-static magnetic ﬁelds, as well as vibrations, which induce
alternating magnetic ﬁelds, can be regarded as direct magnetostrictive sensor responses. In the bending mode,
corresponding magnetostrictive absorption can also be sensed via reduction in the Q-factor due to absorption
losses in a magnetostrictively tunable system.
