I am indebted to my editor, Peter C. Gordon, of Oxford University Press, who initiated
this project and continued his support with skilled guidance, helpful suggestions, and great
encouragement. The people at Oxford University Press, in particular, Senior Project Editor Karen
Shapiro, have been most helpful in this undertaking. My sincere thanks are also due to Mrs. Sally
Gupta, who did a superb job typing most of the manuscript.
