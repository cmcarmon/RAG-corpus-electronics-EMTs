During this radiation process, the E and H fields are in phase in time but physically displaced 90 
degrees in space. Thus, the varying magnetic field produces a varying electric field; and the varying 
electric field, in turn, sustains the varying magnetic field. Each field supports the other, and neither can be 
propagated by itself. Figure 2-4 shows a comparison between the induction field and the radiation field.
