where A(v) is the gain magnitude function, jH (jv)j, and f(v)
is the phase function given by the argument of H (jv). In
addition to the above gain functions, a number of other useful
ratios (network functions) among the voltages and currents of
two port networks can be deﬁned. These deﬁnitions and their
nomenclature are given in Figure 1.30.
