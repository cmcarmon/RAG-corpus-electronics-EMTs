A constant frequency and amplitude can be achieved by taking extreme care to prevent variations in 
LOAD, BIAS, and COMPONENT CHARACTERISTICS. Load variations can greatly affect the 
amplitude and frequency stability of the output of an oscillator. Therefore, maintaining the load as 
constant as possible is necessary to ensure a stable output.
