Varying capacitance
Variable capacitors allow you to adjust capacitance to suit your circuit’s 
needs. The most common type of variable capacitor is the air dielectric,  
which is found frequently in the tuning controls of AM radios. Smaller‐ 
variable capacitors are often used in radio receivers and transmitters, and 
they work in circuits that use quartz crystals to provide an accurate refer-
ence signal. The value of such variable capacitors typically falls in the 5 pF 
to 500 pF range.
