Space analogues can help to train personnel in using technologies and instruments, and in knowing how to behave with a spacesuit. Thus two types of analogue sites exist: underwater sites and surface sites.
Underwater sites simulate a reduced-gravity environment by compensating weight by the Archimedes' principle, thus simulating zero gravity or reduced gravity (lunar gravity, for example).
Surface sites serve to train astronauts to walk and move within a spacesuit, and to test the Mars Exploration Rover (for example). Expeditions to surface sites also help teach geology to astronauts, who mostly trained as pilots.
