Sound Velocity Proﬁles
Sound  rays  that  are  normal  (perpendicular)  to  the  acoustic  wavefront  can  be  traced  from  the  source  to  the
receiver by a process called ray tracing.1 In general, the acoustic ray paths are not straight, but bend in a manner
analogous to optical rays focused by a lens. In underwater acoustics, the ray paths are determined by the sound
velocity proﬁle (SVP) or sound speed proﬁle (SSP), that is, the speed of sound in water as a function of water
