The monopulse system employs two overlapping antenna
patterns to form the sum pattern and the difference pattern.
The sum pattern is used for transmission, and both the sum
pattern and difference pattern are used for reception. The sum
pattern provides target detection and range measurement. The
difference pattern provides the magnitude of the angular error.
The monopulse antenna should have a sum pattern with high
gain in the foresight and have a difference pattern with a large
value of slope at the crossover of the offset beams.
