The fourth step is to compute the heliocentric distance r from the true anomaly θ by Kepler's first law:





r
(
1
+
ε
cos
⁡
θ
)
=
a
(
1
−

ε

2


)


{\displaystyle \ r(1+\varepsilon \cos \theta )=a(1-\varepsilon ^{2})}

Using the relation above between θ and E the final equation for the distance r is:





r
=
a
(
1
−
ε
cos
⁡
E
)
.


{\displaystyle \ r=a(1-\varepsilon \cos E).}
