PULSE-POSITION MODULATION.â€”The amplitude and width of the pulse is kept constant in
the system. The position of each pulse, in relation to the position of a recurrent reference pulse, is varied
by each instantaneous sampled value of the modulating wave. Ppm has the advantage of requiring
constant transmitter power since the pulses are of constant amplitude and duration. It is widely used but
has the disadvantage of depending on transmitter-receiver synchronization.
