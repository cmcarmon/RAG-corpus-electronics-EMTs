The first results of a numerical simulation that provided verification of the Kadomtsev model were published in 1976. This simulation demonstrated a single Kadomtsev-like sawtooth relaxation. In 1987 the first results of a simulation demonstrating repeated, quasi-periodic sawtooth relaxations was published. Results from resistive MHD simulations of repeated sawtoothing generally give reasonably accurate crash times and sawtooth period times for smaller tokamaks with relatively small Lundquist numbers.
In large tokamaks with larger Lundquist numbers, sawtooth relaxations are observed to occur much faster than predicted by the resistive Kadomtsev model. Simulations using two-fluid model equations or non-ideal terms in Ohm's law besides the resistive term, such as the Hall and electron inertia terms, can account for the fast crash times observed in hot tokamaks. These models can allow much faster reconnection at low resistivity.
