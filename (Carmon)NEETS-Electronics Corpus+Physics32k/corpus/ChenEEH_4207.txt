needed to regulate an access to the common medium. There
are two approaches for control of the multiple transmissions.
In the centralized approach, a station on the network is
designated as a primary station, and the rest of the stations
are the secondary stations. All communications have to be
polled and selected by the primary station. The primary station
polls for a secondary station on the network for transmission
and then selects a speciÔ¨Åc secondary station for the reception
of a message. There is no direct transmission between any two
secondary stations. In the distributed approach, each station
has a MAC to decide when it can transmit, and the direct
transmission occurs between any two stations. The distributed
approach is currently used by most local networks. The advan-
tages and disadvantages of the centralized approach are in the
following list. Note that the opposite of the advantages and
disadvantages on the list would become the disadvantages and
advantages of the distributed approach, respectively.
