reliable than combinations of capacitors and inductors, but there’s a catch: 
They’re usually more expensive. You will find crystals used in circuits called 
oscillators to generate electric signals at a very precise frequency. Oscillators 
are responsible for the ticks and tocks that control quartz wristwatches and 
digital integrated circuits (which I discuss in Chapter 11), and for controlling 
the accuracy of radio equipment.
