Orbital speed (how fast a satellite is moving through space) is calculated by multiplying the angular speed of the satellite by the orbital radius:

{\displaystyle R_{syn}={\sqrt[{3}]{G(m2)T^{2} \over 4\pi ^{2}}}}

G = Gravitational constant
m2 = Mass of the celestial body
T = rotational period of the body
By this formula we can find the geostationary-type orbit of an object in relation to Mars (this type of orbit above is referred to as an areostationary orbit if it is above Mars).
We know the mass of Mar is 6.39 x

, and the rotational period of Mars is 24 hours and 39 minutes. If we do the math we get 20,428 km (12693 mi).
