Superconductivity promises extraordinary capabilities for electric circuits. If conductor re-
sistance could be eliminated entirely, there would be no power losses or inefﬁciencies in electric
power systems due to stray resistances. Electric motors could be made almost perfectly (100%)
efﬁcient. Components such as capacitors and inductors, whose ideal characteristics are nor-
mally spoiled by inherent wire resistances, could be made ideal in a practical sense. Already,
some practical superconducting conductors, motors, and capacitors have been developed, but
their use at this present time is limited due to the practical problems intrinsic to maintaining
super-cold temperatures.
