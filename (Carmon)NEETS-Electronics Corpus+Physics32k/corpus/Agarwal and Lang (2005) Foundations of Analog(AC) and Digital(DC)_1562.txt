Assume that the input B is 0 V at all times. Assume further that the input A has 0 V
applied to it initially. At time t = t0, a 5-V step is applied at the input A. Plot the form
of vP as a function of time. Clearly show the value of vP just prior to t0 and just after t0.
Assume that the ON resistance of a MOSFET is given by the relation (W/L)Rn and that
MOSFETâ€™s threshold voltage is VT < VS. Also assume that VT < 5 V.
