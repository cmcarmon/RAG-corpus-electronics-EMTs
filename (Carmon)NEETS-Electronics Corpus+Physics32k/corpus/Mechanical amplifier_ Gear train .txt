Gear trains are usually formed by the meshing engagement of two or more gears on a frame to form a transmission. This can provide translation (linear motion) or rotation as well as mechanically alter displacement, speed, velocity, acceleration, direction and torque depending on the type of gears employed, transmission configuration and gearing ratio.
The mechanical advantage of a gear train is given by the ratio of the output torque TB and input torque TA, which is also the same ratio of number of teeth of the output gear NB and the number of teeth of the input gear NA.

{\displaystyle MA={\frac {T_{B}}{T_{A}}}={\frac {N_{B}}{N_{A}}}.}

Therefore, torque can be amplified if the number of teeth of the output gear is larger than that of the input gear.
The ratio of the number of gear teeth is also related to the gear velocities ωA and ωB as follows.

{\displaystyle {\frac {T_{A}}{T_{B}}}={\frac {\omega _{B}}{\omega _{A}}}.}

Therefore, if the number of teeth of the output gear is less than that of the input, the output velocity is amplified.
