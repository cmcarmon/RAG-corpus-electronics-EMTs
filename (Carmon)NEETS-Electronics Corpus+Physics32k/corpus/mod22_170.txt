Another type of storage device is magnetic tape which is similar to the tape used with commercial 
tape recorders. It is used mainly for secondary storage. It differs from commercial tape in that it is usually 
wider (ranging from one-half inch to an inch), and it is manufactured to more rigid quality specifications. 
It is made of a MYLARÂ® base coated with a magnetic oxide that can be magnetized to store data. 
Magnetic tape comes in a variety of lengths (from 600 to 3,000 feet), and is packaged in one of three 
ways: open reel, cartridge, or cassette, as shown in figure 2-11. Large computers use standard open reels, 
1/2-inch wide tape, 2,400 feet in length. Magnetic tape units are categorized by the type of packaging 
used for the tape. The tape unit (or drive) shown in figure 2-12 uses open reels, while cartridge tape units 
use tape cartridges and cassette units use tape cassettes. Cartridge tape units are often used on personal 
computers to provide backup for hard disk.
