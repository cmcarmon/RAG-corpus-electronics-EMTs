I and Q signals are composed of red, green, and blue primary color components produced by color cameras
and  other  signal  generators.  The  phase  relationship  among  the  I  and  Q  signals,  the  derived  primary  and
complementary colors, and the color synchronizing burst can be shown graphically on a vectorscope display.
The  horizontal  and  vertical  sweep  signals  on  a  vectorscope  are  produced  from  R-Y  and  B-Y  subcarrier  sine
waves in quadrature, producing a circular display. The chrominance signal controls the intensity of the display.
A  vectorscope  display  of  an  Electronic  Industries  Association  (EIA)  standard  color  bar  signal  is  shown  in
Fig. 69.19.
