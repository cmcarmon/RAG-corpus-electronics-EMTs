At T2 the input signal again becomes positive and the cycle repeats. The time duration between 
pulses is the interval represented by the period between T1 and T2 or between T3 and T4. If the input-
pulse frequency is reduced, these time periods become longer. On the other hand, if the frequency is 
increased, these time intervals become shorter. With shorter periods, more pulses occur in a given length 
of time and a higher average dc output voltage is produced; with longer periods, fewer pulses occur and a 
lower average dc output voltage is produced. Thus, the dc output is directly proportional to the repetition 
frequency of the input pulses. If the current and voltage are sufficiently large, a direct-reading meter can 
be used to indicate the count. If they are not large enough to actuate a meter directly, a dc amplifier may 
be added. In the latter case, a pi-type filter network is inserted at the output of R1 to absorb the 
instantaneous pulse variations and produce a smooth direct current for amplification.
