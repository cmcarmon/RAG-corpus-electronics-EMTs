Hydrogenated-Amorphous Silicon
In  contrast  to  more  perfect  crystalline  materials,  amorphous  semiconductors  have  neither  short-  nor  long-
range structural order. At its introduction, a-Si:H seemed to be the ideal photovoltaic candidate. Its bandgap
can be varied over tenths of eVs by changing the hydrogen content. Because its physics are considerably different
from its single-crystal relative, its absorption characteristics make it about 100 times more effective in absorbing
the sun’s irradiance. It also has beneﬁted technologically because there are other electronic technologies (tran-
sistors, ﬂat-panel displays) that have enhanced knowledge and understanding of its properties.
