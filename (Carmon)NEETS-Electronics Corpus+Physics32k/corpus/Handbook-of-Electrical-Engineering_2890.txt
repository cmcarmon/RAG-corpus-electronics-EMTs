infrared (IR) heating, convection heating, or a combination of the two. In IR ovens the absorbance of the paste,
parts,  glue,  etc.  as  a  function  of  color  should  considered.  Convection  ovens  tend  to  be  more  forgiving  with
variations  in  color  and  thermal  masses  on  the  substrates.  This  author  does  not  recommend  vapor  phase
(condensation heating) ovens to new users of SMT. All ovens are zoned to provide a thermal proﬁle necessary
for successful SMD soldering. An example of an oven proﬁle is shown in Fig. 26.12, and the phases of reﬂow
soldering that are reﬂected in that example include:
