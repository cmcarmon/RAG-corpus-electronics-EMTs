Hermann Minkowski (1908) showed the relation between a point on a worldline and the magnitude of four-acceleration and a "curvature hyperbola" (German: Kr√ºmmungshyperbel). In the context of Born rigidity, Max Born (1909) subsequently coined the term "hyperbolic motion" (German: Hyperbelbewegung) for the case of constant magnitude of four-acceleration, then provided a detailed description for charged particles in hyperbolic motion, and introduced the corresponding "hyperbolically accelerated reference system" (German: hyperbolisch beschleunigtes Bezugsystem). Born's formulas were simplified and extended by Arnold Sommerfeld (1910). For early reviews see the textbooks by Max von Laue (1911, 1921) or Wolfgang Pauli (1921).
