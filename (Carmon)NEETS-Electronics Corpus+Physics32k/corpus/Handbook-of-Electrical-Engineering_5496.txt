In the circuit shown in Fig. 61.19, open-
ing  CB  (air-blast  circuit  breaker)  causes
current  to  be  commutated  to  the  parallel
LC circuit. The commutating circuit will be
oscillatory, which creates current zero in the
circuit breaker. The opening of CB increases
the voltage across the commutating circuit,
which  will  be  limited  by  the  zinc  oxide
varistor ZnO1 by entering into conduction.
The  resistance  R  is  the  closing  resistor  in
series with switch S.
