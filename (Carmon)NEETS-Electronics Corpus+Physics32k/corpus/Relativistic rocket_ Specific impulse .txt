The specific impulse of relativistic rockets is the same as the effective exhaust velocity, despite the fact that the nonlinear relationship of velocity and momentum as well as the conversion of matter to energy have to be taken into account; the two effects cancel each other. I.e.





I

p


=

v

e




{\displaystyle I_{sp}=v_{e}}
(check if dimensionally correct)
Of course this is only valid if the rocket does not have an external energy source (e. g. a laser beam from a space station; in this case the momentum carried by the laser beam also has to be taken into account). If all the energy to accelerate the fuel comes from an external source (and there is no additional momentum transfer), then the relationship between effective exhaust velocity and specific impulse is as follows:

{\displaystyle I_{sp}={\frac {v_{e}}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v_{e}^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}=\gamma _{e}\ v_{e},}

where

{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the Lorentz factor.
In the case of no external energy source, the relationship between

{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
and the fraction of the fuel mass

which is converted into energy might also be of interest; assuming no losses, is

Here are some examples of fuels, the energy conversion fractions and the corresponding specific impulses (assuming no losses):
In actual rocket engines, there will be losses, lowering the specific impulse. In electron-positron annihilation, the gamma rays are emitted in a spherically symmetric fashion, and they almost cannot be reflected with current technology. Therefore, they cannot be directed towards the rear. A simple solution would be to have a gamma ray absorber absorbing all the gamma rays moving in the forward direction, delivering part of the thrust; and letting the rest be emitted without any deflection (therefore with an angle of divergence of 180°), which cuts in half the (average) useful momentum of the gamma rays, resulting in the specific impulse being less of what it would be in the idealized case.
