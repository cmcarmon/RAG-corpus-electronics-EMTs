Since the cosine is an even function [cos(â€“q) = cos q], specifying the power factor does not reveal the sign
of q. Remember that q is the angle of the impedance. If q is positive, this means that the current lags the voltage;
we say that the power factor is a lagging power factor. On the other hand, if q is negative, the current leads the
voltage and we say this represent a leading power factor.
