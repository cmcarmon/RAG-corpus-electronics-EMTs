While the transducer that produces an electrical signal proportional to strain may have an output of 0.01 V,
the live transmission line to which it is attached may be at a potential of several hundred thousand volts. The
problem  is  to  detect  this  hundredth  of  a  volt  in  the  presence  of  a  very  large  signal.  In  the  language  of  the
 to 1. Then why not deenergize
telemetry engineer, this is rejection of a common mode voltage on the order of 10
the line? It’s a simple matter of economics—an idle line transmits no power, and the wind forces that cause
the  line  to  vibrate  are  neither  predictable  nor  constant.  So,  weeks  or  months  may  be  spent  in  gathering
measurements for a particular set of spans. However, a radio telemetry link makes it possible to transmit the
strain signal even while power is being carried.
