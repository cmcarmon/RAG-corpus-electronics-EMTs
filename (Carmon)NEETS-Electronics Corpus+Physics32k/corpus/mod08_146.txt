Figure 1-28 shows a two-stage phase splitter. C1 couples the input signal to the base of Q1. R1 
develops the input signal and provides bias for the base of Q1. R2 provides bias and temperature stability 
for Q1. C2 decouples signals from the emitter of Q1. R3 develops the output signal of Q1. Since Q1 is 
configured as a common-emitter amplifier, the output signal of Q1 is 180ยบ out of phase with the input 
signal and larger in amplitude. C3 couples this output signal to the next stage through R4. R4 allows only 
a small portion of this output signal to be applied to the base of Q2. R5 develops the input signal and 
provides bias for the base of Q2. R6 is used for bias and temperature stability for Q2. C4 decouples 
signals from the emitter of Q2. R7 develops the output signal from Q2. Q2 is configured as a 
common-emitter amplifier, so the output signal is 180ยบ out of phase with the input signal to Q2 (output 
signal from Q1). The input signal to Q2 is 180ยบ out of phase with the original input signal, so the output 
from Q2 is in phase with the original input signal. C5 couples this output signal to the next stage. So the 
circuitry shown provides two output signals that are 180ยบ out of phase with each other. The output signals 
are equal in amplitude with each other but larger than the input signal.
