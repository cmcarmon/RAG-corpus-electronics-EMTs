After 2010, LIGO went offline for several years for a major upgrade, installing the new Advanced LIGO detectors in the LIGO Observatory infrastructures.
The project continued to attract new members, with the Australian National University and University of Adelaide contributing to Advanced LIGO, and by the time the LIGO Laboratory started the first observing run 'O1' with the Advanced LIGO detectors in September 2015, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration included more than 900 scientists worldwide.
The first observing run operated at a sensitivity roughly 3 times greater than Initial LIGO, and a much greater sensitivity for larger systems with their peak radiation at lower audio frequencies.
On 11 February 2016, the LIGO and Virgo collaborations announced the first observation of gravitational waves. The signal was named GW150914. The waveform showed up on 14 September 2015, within just two days of when the Advanced LIGO detectors started collecting data after their upgrade. It matched the predictions of general relativity for the inward spiral and merger of a pair of black holes and subsequent 'ringdown' of the resulting single black hole. The observations demonstrated the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.
On 15 June 2016, LIGO announced the detection of a second gravitational wave event, recorded on 26 December 2015, at 3:38 UTC. Analysis of the observed signal indicated that the event was caused by the merger of two black holes with masses of 14.2 and 7.5 solar masses, at a distance of 1.4 billion light years. The signal was named GW151226.
An imminent six-month O2 run was anticipated in November 2016, with Livingston achieving 15–25% sensitivity improvement over O1, and with Hanford—despite upgrades—disappointingly on par with its previous sensitivity (though with a better signal-to-noise ratio).
As planned in 2013, further upgrades following O2 (of unspecified duration) will be followed by a nine-month O3. Further observing runs will be interleaved with commissioning efforts to further improve the sensitivity. It is aimed to achieve design sensitivity in 2021.
In 2017, LIGO saw four further gravitational waves: the first (GW170104) in January; the second (GW170608) in June; the third (GW170814) and the fourth (GW170817) both in August. GW170814 and GW170817 were also seen by the Virgo Collaboration. GW170817 is likely from the collision of two neutron stars and was also detected electromagnetically by gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes.
