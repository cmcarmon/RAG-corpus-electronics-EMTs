 method and close the loop
around the joints of the robot. The desired joint positions corresponding to a tool trajectory are either taught
  or  generated  by  solving  an  inverse  kinematics  problem.  The  independent  joint  control
by  using  a 
method, however, is effective only at low speeds. As the speeds increase, the coupling effects between the joints
increase and warrant the inclusion of these effects in the controller development. Advanced controller devel-
opment and implementation based on full dynamics is one of the active areas of current research. New advances
in sensor technology, faster computers, advanced robots such as direct drive arms and industrial competition
provide new opportunities and motivation for accelerating the development and implementation of advanced
controllers for robots in the near future.
