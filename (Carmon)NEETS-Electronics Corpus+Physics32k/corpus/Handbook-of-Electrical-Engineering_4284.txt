The  Doppler  system  discussed  above  has  a  maximum  detection  range  based  on  signal  strength  and  other
factors, but it cannot measure range. The rate of change in signal strength as a function of range has sometimes
been used in fuzes to estimate range closure and Ô¨Åring point, but this is a relative measure.
