Transformers 
 
Transformers provide us with a means of coupling 
a.c.  power  or  signals  from  one  circuit  to  another. 
Voltage  may  be  stepped-up  (secondary  voltage 
greater  than  primary  voltage)  or  stepped-down 
(secondary  voltage  less  than  primary  voltage). 
Since  no 
is  possible 
(transformers are passive components like resistors, 
capacitors and inductors) an increase in  secondary 
voltage  can  only  be  achieved  at  the  expense  of  a 
corresponding  reduction  in  secondary  current,  and 
vice  versa  (in  fact,  the  secondary  power  will  be 
very  slightly  less  than  the  primary  power  due  to 
losses within the transformer). Typical applications
