Notice that the input signal, output signal, and feedback signal are all in phase. (Only the positive
alternation of the signal is shown.) It may appear as if the feedback is regenerative (positive) because the
feedback and input signals are in phase. The feedback is, in reality, degenerative (negative) because the
input signals is applied to the noninverting input and the feedback signal is applied to the inverting input,
(Remember, that the operational amplifier will react to the difference between the two inputs.)
