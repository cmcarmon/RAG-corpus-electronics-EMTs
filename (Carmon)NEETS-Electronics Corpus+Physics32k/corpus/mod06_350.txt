The cold-cathode, gas-filled tube differs from the other types of gas-filled tubes in that it lacks
filaments. Thus, its name "COLD-CATHODE TUBE." In the tubes covered in this text thus far,
thermionic emission was used to send electrons from the cathode to the plate. This conduction of
electrons can be caused in another manner. If the potential between the plate and the cathode is raised to
the point where tube resistance is overcome, current will flow from the cathode whether it is heated or
