The second section of the transmitter contains the audio circuitry. This section of the transmitter 
takes the small signal from the microphone and increases its amplitude to the amount necessary to fully 
modulate the carrier. The last audio stage is the MODULATOR. It applies its signal to the carrier in the 
final power amplifier. In this way, intelligence is included in the radiated rf waveform.
