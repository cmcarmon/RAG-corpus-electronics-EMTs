These general steps are illustrated in Fig. 25.24(a), roughly showing the basic steps taken. A representative
example [Lipman, 1995] of a contemporary design approach is illustrated in Fig. 25.24(b). Design approaches
are  continually  changing  and  Fig. 25.24(b)  is  merely  one  of  several  current  design  sequences.  Below,  we
summarize the general steps highlighted in Fig. 25.24(a).
