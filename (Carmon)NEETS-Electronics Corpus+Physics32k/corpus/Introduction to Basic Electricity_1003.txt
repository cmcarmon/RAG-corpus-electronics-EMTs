■● Body resistance is low if the skin is moist. This re-
sults in a high current flow, and if the current flow 
is through the chest region, the heart can receive a 
lethal dose of current. The heart may go into fibril-
lation and breathing may be stopped (Figure 7-13).
Small amounts of current through the body can be 
dangerous to one’s health. Large amounts of current 
through the body can be fatal. A shock of 1 to 20 mA 
can cause a painful sensation. At a shock of approxi-
mately 20 to 30 mA, breathing stops. A shock above 
100 mA results in electrocution.
