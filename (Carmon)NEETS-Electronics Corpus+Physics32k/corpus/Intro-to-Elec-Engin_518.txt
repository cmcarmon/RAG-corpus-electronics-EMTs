The ds can be treated either as 0s or 1s when the subcubes are formed in the K map, depending
on which results in a greater simpliÔ¨Åcation, thereby helping in the formation of the smallest number
of maximal subcubes. Note that some or all of the ds can be treated as 0s or 1s. However, one
should not form a subcube that contains only ds.
