Some radars provide a tank of nitrogen as an emergency source that can be connected in place of dry 
air. Special safety precautions must be taken when you handle compressed gases because of the 
possibility of explosion. Nitrogen does not support life; when released in a confined space, it can cause 
asphyxiation.
