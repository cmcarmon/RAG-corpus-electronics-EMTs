If a wave strikes a thin, very highly ionized layer, the wave may be bent back so rapidly that it will 
appear to have been reflected instead of refracted back to Earth. To reflect a radio wave, the highly 
ionized layer must be approximately no thicker than one wavelength of the radio wave. Since the ionized 
layers are often several miles thick, ionospheric reflection is more likely to occur at long wavelengths 
(low frequencies).
