Just as with the RC circuit, the inductor voltage’s approach to 0 volts and the current’s
approach to 15 amps over time is asymptotic. For all practical purposes, though, we can say
that the inductor voltage will eventually reach 0 volts and that the current will eventually
equal the maximum of 15 amps.
