Tunebot is a Query by humming system. It compares a sung query to a database of musical themes by using the intervals between each note. This allows a user to sing in a different key than the target recording and still produce a match. The intervals are also unquantized to allow for other tunings besides the standard A=440Hz, since not many people in the world have perfect pitch.
In addition to note intervals, Tunebot compares a query with potential targets by using rhythmic ratios between notes. Since ratios between note lengths are used, the tempo of the performance does not affect the rhythmic similarity measure.
Queries and targets are then matched by a weighted string alignment algorithm between the note intervals and rhythmic ratios.
