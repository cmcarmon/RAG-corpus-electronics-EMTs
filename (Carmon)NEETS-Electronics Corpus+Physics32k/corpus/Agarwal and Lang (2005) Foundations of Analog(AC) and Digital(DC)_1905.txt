However, notice that as the frequency of the input sinusoid increases, the
amplitude of the output sinusoid decreases. In fact, for very high frequencies
(Ï‰ (cid:7) 1/RLCGS), the amplitude of vo tends to 0. The insight behind the high
frequency result is that the capacitor behaves as a short for high frequencies.
The resulting zero impedance of the load reduces the amplifier gain to 0.
