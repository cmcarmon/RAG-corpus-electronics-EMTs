Perhaps of greatest impact is the rapid increase in the importance of interconnect delay relative to gate delay.
In  the  earlier  1 mm VLSI  technologies,  typical  gate  delays  were  about  six  times  the  average  interconnection
delays. For the 0.5 mm technologies, gate delays had decreased while interconnect delays had increased, becoming
approximately equal. At 0.3 mm, the decreasing gate delay and increasing interconnect delays have led to average
interconnect delays about six times greater than typical gate delays. Accurate estimation of signal delays early
in  the  design  is  therefore  increasingly  difﬁcult,  since  the  designer  does  not  have  a  detailed  knowledge  of
interconnection lengths and nearby lines, which can cause coupling noise, until much of the design has been
completed. As the design proceeds and the interconnection lengths become better speciﬁed, parameters related
to the signal performance can be fed back (back-annotated) to the earlier design steps, allowing the design to
be adapted to reﬂect necessary changes to achieve desired performance.
