Since Thevenin’s and Norton’s Theorems are two equally valid methods of reducing a complex
network down to something simpler to analyze, there must be some way to convert a Thevenin
equivalent circuit to a Norton equivalent circuit, and vice versa (just what you were dying to
know, right?). Well, the procedure is very simple.
