The VERTICAL-DEFLECTION AMPLIFIER increases the amplitude of the input signal level
required for the deflection of the CRT beam. The deflection amplifier must not have any other effect on
the signal, such as changing the shape (called DISTORTION). Figure 6-21 shows the results of distortion
occurring in a deflection amplifier.
