A number of problems have been pointed out in the use of clinostats to simulate microgravity:
gravitational effects still occur, they just have no net direction. Therefore rather than simulating microgravity they are best thought of as inducing omnilateral gravistimulation
leaves of large plants flop about as they rotate; this may cause an increase in ethylene production, which may in turn cause some of the phenomena otherwise attributed to agravitropism. Other researchers have questioned this interpretation, and it has been suggested that ethylene may have a role in the gravitropic response
vibration from the motor and other motion effects may lead to artifacts.
