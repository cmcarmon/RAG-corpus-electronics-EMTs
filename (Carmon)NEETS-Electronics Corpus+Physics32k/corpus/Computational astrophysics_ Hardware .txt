Like other similar fields, computational astrophysics makes extensive use of supercomputers and computer clusters . Even on the scale of a normal desktop it is possible to accelerate the hardware. Perhaps the most notable such computer architecture built specially for astrophysics is the GRAPE (gravity pipe) in Japan.
As of 2010, the biggest N-body simulations, such as DEGIMA, do general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.
