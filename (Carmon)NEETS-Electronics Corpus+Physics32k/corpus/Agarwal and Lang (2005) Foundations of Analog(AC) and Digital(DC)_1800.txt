The mathematical computation of the form of the output voltage is complicated, so
we do not present it here. Instead, we present a qualitative discussion of the circuit,
behavior. First, when S2 is closed and S1 is open, we have a slightly more complicated
RLC circuit, which behaves in a manner similar to the original circuit. Essentially, the
inductor current charges the capacitor to a higher voltage.
