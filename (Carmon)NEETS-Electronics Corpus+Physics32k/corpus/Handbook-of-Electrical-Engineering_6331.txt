Forward error correction is applied to the multiplexed digital signal to produce an encoded signal (H) that
makes the transmission less susceptible to uncorrected bit errors. This is needed because of the anticipated low
transmission  power  rates.  Error  control  is  also  important  because  compression  can  amplify  error  effectsâ€”a
single bit error can affect many picture elements.
