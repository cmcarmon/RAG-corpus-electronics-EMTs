With the POLARITY switch (fig. 2-4) in the OFF position, the meter pointer should indicate exactly
zero. (When required, rotate the meter adjust screw on the front of the meter to fulfill this requirement.)
When measurements are not actually being made, the POLARITY switch must always be left in the OFF
position to prevent battery drain.
