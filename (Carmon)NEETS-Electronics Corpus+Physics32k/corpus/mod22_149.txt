Although magnetic core storage is no longer as popular as it once was, we will cover it in some 
detail because its concepts are easily understood and apply generally to the more integrated 
semiconductor and bubble-type memories. Magnetic core storage is made up of tiny doughnut-shaped 
rings made of ferrite (iron), that are strung on a grid of very thin wires (fig. 2-3). Since data in computers 
is stored in binary form (refer to NEETS, module 13), a two-state device is needed to represent the two 
binary digits (bits), 0 for off and 1 for on. In core storage, each ferrite ring can represent a 0 or 1 bit, 
depending on its magnetic state. If magnetized in one direction, it represents a 1 bit, and if magnetized in 
the opposite direction, it represents a 0 bit. These cores are magnetized by sending an electric current 
through the wires on which the core is strung. It is this direction of current that determines the state of 
each core.
