This style organizes its symbols differently from the American style. In the 
United States, you express resistor values over 1,000 Ω in the form of 6.8k 
or 10.2k, with the lowercase k following the value. The European schematic 
style eliminates the decimal point. Typical of schematics you’d find in the 
United Kingdom are resistor values expressed in the form 6k8 or 10k2. This 
style substitutes the lowercase k (which stands for kilohms, or thousands of 
ohms) for the decimal point.
