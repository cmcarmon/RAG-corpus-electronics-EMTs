However, during the first 10 percent of the first time constant, the rate of voltage change across the 
capacitor is almost constant (linear). Suppose that S1 is placed in position P at T0, and C is allowed to 
charge for 0.1 time constant. This is shown as T0 to T1 in view (B). Notice that the rate of voltage change 
across C is nearly constant between T0 and T1. Now, assume that at T1 the switch is moved from position 
P to position Q. This shorts the capacitor, and it discharges very rapidly. If the switch is placed back in 
position P, the capacitor will start charging again.
