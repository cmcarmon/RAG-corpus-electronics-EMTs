As observed earlier, the problem of network analysis is to
determine the voltages and currents associated with the ele-
ments of an electrical network. These voltages and currents can
be determined from Kirchhoff ’s equations and the element
voltage–current (v–i) relations given by Ohm’s law. However,
these equations involve a large number of variables. As can
be seen from the loop and cutset transformations, not all
these variables are independent. Furthermore,
in place of
KCL equations, the loop transformation can be used, which
involves only chord currents as variables. Similarly, KVL
equations can be replaced by the cutset transformation that
involves only branch voltage variables. Taking advantage of
these transformations enables the establishment of different
sytems of network equations known as the loop and cutset
systems.
