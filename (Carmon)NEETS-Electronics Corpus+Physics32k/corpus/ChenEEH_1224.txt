It is known that proper wire sizing can effectively reduce the
interconnect delay especially in deep submicron or nanometer
designs when the wire resistance becomes signiﬁcant. An opti-
mal wire-sizing algorithm was developed by Cong and Leung
(1993) and Cong et al. (1993) for a single source RC intercon-
nect tree to minimize the sum of weighted delays from the
source to timing-critical sinks under the Elmore delay model.
Cong et al. (1997) designed an efﬁcient approach to perform
global interconnects sizing and spacing (GISS) for multiple
nets to minimize interconnect delays with consideration of
coupling capacitance as well as area and fringing capacitances.
In that paper,
they proposed an asymmetric wire-sizing
scheme where they could asymmetrically widen or make
more narrow the areas above and below the centerline of the
original wire. The optimal wire sizing and spacing problem for
a single net with ﬁxed surrounding wire segments can be
solved by adapting the bottom-up dynamic programming
(DP)-based buffer insertion and wire-sizing algorithm pro-
posed by Lillis et al. (1996).
