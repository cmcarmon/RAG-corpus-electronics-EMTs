A single generator that is connected to an ideal generator
bus through a transmission line is shown in Figure 7.14. The
ideal generator maintains its bus voltage at 1 pu irrespective of
the external dynamics and is referred to as an inﬁnite bus. It
also deﬁnes the reference angle for this power system, and the
angle is set at zero. The other generator is represented by the
classical machine model with a voltage source of E0ﬀu con-
nected to the generator terminal through the transient reac-
0
tance x
d. In the classical machine model, the internal induced
voltage E0 is assumed to remain constant, and the rotor angle u
follows the second-order swing equations as in equation 7.68
but here includes a damping component Pd:
