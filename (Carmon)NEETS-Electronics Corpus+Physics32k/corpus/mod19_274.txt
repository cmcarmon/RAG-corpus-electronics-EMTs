LISSAJOUS PATTERNS.Â—The simplest lissajous patterns are produced by two sine waves of the 
same frequency and amplitude being applied to the horizontal and vertical deflection voltage inputs of an 
oscilloscope. Figure 1-37 shows patterns for several common phase relationships. These can be used to 
estimate the approximate phase angle of the two signals being studied.
