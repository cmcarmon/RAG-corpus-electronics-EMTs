the proper conditions, they may even be recharged thousands of times. They can be stored for a number of
years with no significant loss of performance. After just a few charge and discharge cycles, NICAD cells
can be recharged to the point that they are just as good as new batteries. Since they are sealed, they are
maintenance free and can be installed in any position. There are two types of nickel-cadmium batteries â€”
vented and nonvented. This description deals with the nonvented exclusively because a vented NICAD
would have extremely limited application in a shipboard environment.
