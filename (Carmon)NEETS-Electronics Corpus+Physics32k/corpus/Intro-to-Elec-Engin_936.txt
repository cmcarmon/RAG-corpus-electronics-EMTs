16 cm2, the average length of the magnetic path
in the core lC be 40 cm, the number of turns
N of the excitation coil be 100 turns, and the
relative permeability µr of the core be 50,000.
For a magnetic ﬂux density of 1.5 T in the core,
determine:
(a) The ﬂux φ
(b) Total ﬂux linkage λ(= N φ).
(c) The current required through the coil.
