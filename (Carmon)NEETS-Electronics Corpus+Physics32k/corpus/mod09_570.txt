At T3 the +25 volts of the input signal is series aiding with the +35 volts across C1. Again the output 
voltage is +60 volts. Observe that at T3 the conditions in the circuit are the same as they were at T1. 
Therefore, the circuit operation from T3 to T4 is the same as it was from T1 to T2. Circuit operation 
continues as a duplication of the operations which occurred from T1 to T3.
