It has been shown that the Majumdarâ€“Ghosh model has two minimum energy states, or ground states, namely the states in which neighboring pairs of spins form singlet configurations. The wavefunction for each ground state is a product of these singlet pairs. This explains why there must be at least two ground states with the same energy, since one may be obtained from the other by merely shifting, or translating, the system by one lattice spacing. It should be noted, however, that this ground state degeneracy only appears when the system is taken to be infinite in size (the so-called thermodynamic limit). Otherwise, there is a unique ground state and a second, higher energy state whose energy approaches the first exponentially quickly with increasing system size.
