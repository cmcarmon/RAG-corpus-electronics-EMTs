It might seem to you that electrons flow from the negative plate to the positive filament under these
conditions. This is NOT the case. Remember that it takes a heated element to emit electrons and that the
filament is the only heated element in the diode. The plate is cold. Therefore, electrons cannot leave the
plate, and plate-to-filament current cannot exist.
