analog applications) constitute the source and the drain. The region separating
the source and the drain is called the channel region. The channel region is
overlayed with a thin insulating layer (for example, 0.01 Âµm thick) made out
of silicon dioxide (commonly called gate oxide). The gate oxide layer is in
turn sandwiched between a layer of conducting polysilicon on top and the
p-type substrate. The polysilicon layer top of the gate oxide forms the gate of
the MOSFET.
