In Fuzion, whenever a character performs some kind of critical action that needs to be resolved, they make a die roll to see if they succeed or fail at the task. There are two kinds of resolution tests in Fuzion; those rolled against a Difficulty Value (DV) determined by the Referee, and those rolled against another character. DVs range from "very easy", such as hefting a bag of garbage to the street (DV 2), to "cosmic", like hefting a mountain and throwing it into an ocean (DV 100+). When resolving a contest between characters, the DV of the check is the result of the opposing force's roll or, to save time, the Referee could add a set number, "+X", to an NPC's abilities (typically +10 when using 3d6 or +5 using 1d10).
Regardless of what the character is rolling against, the player has to roll the target number or higher on the dice to succeed. This the opposite of Fuzion's parent, the HERO System (which is similar to the GURPS mechanic), where the roll must be equal to, or less than the target number to succeed.
