A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits incoherent light, through
spontaneous emission, when a current is passed through it. Typically LEDs for the 850-nm region are
fabricated using GaAs and AlGaAs. LEDs for the 1300-nm and 1550-nm regions are fabricated using
InGaAsP and InP.
