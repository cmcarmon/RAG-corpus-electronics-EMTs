Now let us consider how to estimate the computer resources required. Given the shortest wavelength of interest,
the cell dimensions are determined as 1/10 of this wavelength (or less if greater accuracy is required). From
this and the physical size of the problem geometry the total number of cells in the problem space (here denoted
as  NC)  can  be  determined.  We  assume  that  the  material  information  for  each  cell  edge  is  stored  in  1  byte
(INTEGER*1) arrays with only dielectric materials considered. Then, to estimate the computer storage in bytes
required, and assuming single-precision FORTRAN Ô¨Åeld variables, we can use the relationship
