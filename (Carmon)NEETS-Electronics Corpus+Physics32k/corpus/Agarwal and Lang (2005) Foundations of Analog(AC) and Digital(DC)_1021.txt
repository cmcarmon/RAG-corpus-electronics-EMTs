4. The saturation region in BJTs is completely unrelated to the saturation region in MOSFETs, and
one
in fact, normal operation of BJTs attempts to avoid this region. This duplication of terms
representing the favored region of operation in MOSFETs, and the other representing an avoided
region of operation in BJTs
can be the source of confusion, but, unfortunately, has become the
norm in circuit parlance.
