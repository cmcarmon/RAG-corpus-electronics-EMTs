The Lense–Thirring effect, and the effect of frame dragging in general, continues to be studied experimentally.
The Juno spacecraft's suite of science instruments will primarily characterize and explore the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's polar magnetosphere, auroras and mass composition. As Juno is a Polar Orbit mission, it will be possible to measure the orbital frame-dragging, known also as Lense–Thirring precession, caused by the angular momentum of Jupiter.
