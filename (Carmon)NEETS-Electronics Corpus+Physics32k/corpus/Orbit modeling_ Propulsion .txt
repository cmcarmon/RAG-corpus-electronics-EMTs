There are many different types of spacecraft propulsion. Rocket engines are one of the most widely used. The force of a rocket engine is modeled by the equation:

{\displaystyle F_{n}={\dot {m}}\;v_{\text{e}}={\dot {m}}\;v_{\text{e-act}}+A_{\text{e}}(p_{\text{e}}-p_{\text{amb}})}


Another possible method is a solar sail. Solar sails use radiation pressure in a way to achieve a desired propulsive force. The perturbation model due to the solar wind can be used as a model of propulsive force from a solar sail.
