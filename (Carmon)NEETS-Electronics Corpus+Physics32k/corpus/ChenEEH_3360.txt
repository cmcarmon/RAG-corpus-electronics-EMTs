This chapter has introduced the readers to the basic concepts
in power system analysis, namely modeling issues, power ﬂow
studies, and dynamic stability analysis. The concepts have been
illustrated on simple power system representations. In real
power systems, power-ﬂow studies and system stability studies
are routinely carried out for enduring the reliability and secur-
ity of the electric grid separation. While the basic concepts here
have been summarized in this chapter on simple examples, the
real power systems are large-scale, nonlinear systems. The large
interconnected nature of electric networks makes the compu-
tation aspects highly challenging. We have highlighted some of
these issues in this section, and the readers are encouraged to
refer to advanced power system analysis textbooks for add-
itional details.
