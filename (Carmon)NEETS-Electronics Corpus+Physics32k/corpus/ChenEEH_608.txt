large blocking voltage exceeding 5 kV. Inherent material limi-
tations make it impossible to use silicon-based devices beyond
2008C. These limitations have led to the search for new mate-
rials that can handle large voltages. Wide band gap materials
with high carrier mobilities are ideally suited for such applica-
tions. Presently, SiC appears to be the most promising material
to replace Si for high-voltage, high-temperature applications.
With the commercial availability of high-quality silicon car-
bide wafers with lightly doped epitaxial layers, the fabrication
of power devices has become viable. Power switches and recti-
Ô¨Åers fabricated from silicon carbide offer tremendous promise
for reduction of power losses in the device. All the devices
discussed in this chapter have been demonstrated using SiC
technology. However, the predicted superior performance of
