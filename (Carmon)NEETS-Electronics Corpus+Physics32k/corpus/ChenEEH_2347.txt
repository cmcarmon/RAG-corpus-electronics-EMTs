From equation 5.18, the dominant mode is the TE1;0 mode or
the TE0;1 mode depending on whether the dimension a or the
dimension b is the larger of the two. By convention, the larger
dimension is designed to be a, hence, the TE1;0 mode is the
dominant mode. For example, consider a rectangular wave-
guide with dimensions a=b ¼ 3:0, a=b ¼ 2:0, and a=b ¼ 1:0,
and ﬁnd the propagation modes that occur in the guide. From
equation 5.18, the cutoff frequency of the TE1;0 case is the
following:
