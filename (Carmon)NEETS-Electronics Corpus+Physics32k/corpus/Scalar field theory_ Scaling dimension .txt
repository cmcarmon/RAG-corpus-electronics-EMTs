The classical scaling dimension, or mass dimension, Δ, of φ describes the transformation of the field under a rescaling of coordinates:




x

λ
x


{\displaystyle x\rightarrow \lambda x}





ϕ
→

{\displaystyle \phi \rightarrow \lambda ^{-\Delta }\phi ~.}

The units of action are the same as the units of ħ, and so the action itself has zero mass dimension. This fixes the scaling dimension of the field φ to be
