A third technique involves printing out two posi-
tive copies of the artwork 1:1 on transparency film on a 
copying machine. Align the two pieces of film and tape 
them together. They form a positive film transparency. If 
a higher density is needed from the film, align and tape 
additional pieces of film. Sensitize a clean copper-clad 
board with positive resist according to the manufactur-
erâ€™s instructions. Using a contact print frame, sandwich 
the film and sensitized board together with the bottom 
side outward. Expose the sandwiched board and film to 
an ultraviolet light source or sunlight. Develop the board 
in the appropriate developer; rinse and dry the board. 
This technique forms a very high-quality resist.
