A sunset provision can be found in the Corporate Restructuring Promotion Act, which is to facilitate out-of-court workout of insolvent companies. This Act was effective during the period:
i) from January 2001 to December 2005 for the first time; and again
ii) from January 2007 to December 2010.
Now the Act came into force for the third time on May 19, 2011 and will be effective to December 2013. The main content of the Act has been kept intact for the purpose of constant corporate debt restructuring through market functions and promotion of speedy and smooth corporate restructuring, while some minor provisions were modified from time to time.
