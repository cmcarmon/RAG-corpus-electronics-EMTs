The ﬁrst, conceptually simpler design concept, involves the generation of a second current which ﬂows in a
second winding of the stator. This auxiliary winding is spatially displaced on the stator. This brings the motor
design close to the multi-phase principle. The current in the auxiliary winding has to be out of phase with the
current in the main winding, and this is accomplished through the use of increased resistance in it or a capacitor
in series with it. A motor can operate in this fashion over its entire speed range.
