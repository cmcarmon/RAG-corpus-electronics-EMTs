Figure 69.22 shows a general block diagram of a digital HDTV transmitter. Each frame from the camera is
digitized,  and  the  system  has  the  capability  of  storing  one  entire  frame.  Thus  the  processor  works  with  two
inputsâ€”the  current  frame  (A)  and  the  previous  frame  (B).  The  current  frame  and  the  previous  frame  are
compared  in  a  motion detector  that  generates  coded  motion  information  (C). Algorithms  used  for  motion
estimation attempt to produce three-dimensional parameters from sequential two-dimensional information.
Parameters may include velocity estimates for blocks of the picture.
