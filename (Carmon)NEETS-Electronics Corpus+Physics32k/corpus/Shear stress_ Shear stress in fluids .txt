Any real fluids (liquids and gases included) moving along solid boundary will incur a shear stress on that boundary. The no-slip condition dictates that the speed of the fluid at the boundary (relative to the boundary) is zero, but at some height from the boundary the flow speed must equal that of the fluid. The region between these two points is aptly named the boundary layer. For all Newtonian fluids in laminar flow the shear stress is proportional to the strain rate in the fluid where the viscosity is the constant of proportionality. However, for non-Newtonian fluids, this is no longer the case as for these fluids the viscosity is not constant. The shear stress is imparted onto the boundary as a result of this loss of velocity. The shear stress, for a Newtonian fluid, at a surface element parallel to a flat plate, at the point y, is given by:




τ
(
y
)
=
μ



∂
u


∂
y





{\displaystyle \tau (y)=\mu {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}}

where
μ is the dynamic viscosity of the flow;
u is the flow velocity along the boundary;
y is the height above the boundary.
Specifically, the wall shear stress is defined as:





τ


w



≡
τ
(

)

.


{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {w} }\equiv \tau (y=0)=\mu \left.{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right|_{y=0}~~.}

The Newton's constitutive law, for any general geometry (including the flat plate above mentioned), states that shear tensor (a second-order tensor) is proportional to the flow velocity gradient (the velocity is a vector, so its gradient is a second-order tensor):





τ

(



u
→



)
=
μ
∇



u
→





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } ({\vec {u}})=\mu \nabla {\vec {u}}}

and the constant of proportionality is named dynamic viscosity. For an isotropic Newtonian flow it is a scalar, while for anisotropic Newtonian flows it can be a second-order tensor too. The fundamental aspect is that for a Newtonian fluid the dynamic viscosity is independent on flow velocity (i.e., the shear stress constituive law is linear), while non-Newtonian flows this is not true, and one should allow for the modification:





τ

(



u
→



)
=
μ
(



u
→



)
∇



u
→





{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } ({\vec {u}})=\mu ({\vec {u}})\nabla {\vec {u}}}

The above formula is no longer the Newton's law but a generic tensorial identity: one could always find an expression of the viscosity as function of the flow velocity given any expression of the shear stress as function of the flow velocity. On the other hand, given a shear stress as function of the flow velocity, it represents a Newtonian flow only if it can be expressed as a constant for the gradient of the flow velocity. The constant one finds in this case is the dynamic viscosity of the flow.
