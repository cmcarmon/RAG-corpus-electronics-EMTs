The support for the vagina is provided by muscles, membranes, tendons and ligaments. These structures are attached to the hip bones (innominate bones). These bones are the pubis, ilium and ischium.The interior surface of these pelvic bones and their projections and contours are used as attachment sites for the fascia, muscles, tendons and ligaments that support the vagina. These bones are then fuse and attach to the sacrum behind the vagina and anteriorly at the pubic symphysis. Supporting ligaments include the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments. The sacrospinous ligament is unusual in that it is thin and triangular.
