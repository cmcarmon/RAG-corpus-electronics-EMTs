The hydrogen THYRATRON MODULATOR is an electronic switch which requires a positive
trigger of only 150 volts. The trigger potential must rise at the rate of 100 volts per microsecond to cause
the modulator to conduct. In contrast to spark gap devices, the hydrogen thyratron (figure 2-39) operates
over a wide range of anode voltages and pulse-repetition rates. The grid has complete control over the
initiation of cathode emission for a wide range of voltages. The anode is completely shielded from the
cathode by the grid. Thus, effective grid action results in very smooth firing over a wide range of anode
voltages and repetition frequencies. Unlike most other thyratrons, the positive grid-control characteristic
ensures stable operation. In addition, deionization time is reduced by using the hydrogen-filled tube.
