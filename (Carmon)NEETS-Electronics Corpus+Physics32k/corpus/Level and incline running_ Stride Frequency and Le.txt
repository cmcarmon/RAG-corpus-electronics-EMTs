When running at a constant speed, it has been found that stride frequency increases during incline vs. level running with a concomitant decrease in stride length. At a speed of 3 meters/second Gottschall and Kram noted an increase in stride frequency from 1.45±0.06 Hz to 1.51±0.07 Hz at an incline of 9 degrees (15.8%). Telhan et al. validated this finding at a constant speed of 3.13 meters/second and a gradient of 4 degrees (6.98%) when they observed an increase in frequency from 168.5±8.1 steps/minute to 170.5±7.9 steps/minute. Both studies also saw significant decreases in stride length when running on an incline as compared to level running. The previous studies occurred at moderate speeds. When running velocity is increased 4.5 meters/second and grade increased to 30%, the same trends of increasing stride frequency and decreasing stride length are seen.
