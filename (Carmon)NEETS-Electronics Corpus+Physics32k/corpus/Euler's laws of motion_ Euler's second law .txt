Euler's second law states that the rate of change of angular momentum L (sometimes denoted H) about a point that is fixed in an inertial reference frame (often the mass center of the body), is equal to the sum of the external moments of force (torques) acting on that body M (also denoted τ or Γ) about that point:





M

=



d

L



d
t





{\displaystyle \mathbf {M} ={d\mathbf {L}  \over dt}}
.
Note that the above formula holds only if both M and L are computed with respect to a fixed inertial frame or a frame parallel to the inertial frame but fixed on the center of mass. For rigid bodies translating and rotating in only 2D, this can be expressed as:





M

=


r

m



×


a

m
+
I

α



{\displaystyle \mathbf {M} =\mathbf {r} _{\rm {cm}}\times \mathbf {a} _{\rm {cm}}m+I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}}
,
where rcm is the position vector of the center of mass with respect to the point about which moments are summed, α is the angular acceleration of the body about its center of mass, and I is the moment of inertia of the body about its center of mass. See also Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics).
