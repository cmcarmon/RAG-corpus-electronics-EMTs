Conventional transformers have two windings, but others (known as autotransformers) have
only one winding, and still others (known as multiwinding transformers) have more than two
windings. Transformers used in polyphase circuits are known as polyphase transformers. In the
most popular three-phase system, the most common connections are the wye (star or Y) and the
delta (mesh or ) connections.
