To compute the energy dissipated by the circuit, we first need to determine
the currents through the resistors R1 and R2. To facilitate the computation of
the currents, let us first determine vC. To simplify the calculation of vC, we
transform the circuit shown in Figure 11.3 to its Th√©venin equivalent shown in
Figure 11.4. We assume that time t starts from 0 at the moment that the signal
S transitions from low to high. From the circuit in Figure 11.4, we can write an
expression for the voltage vC as
