To overcome this, a bypass capacitor (Csg) is connected between the screen grid and ground. The
addition of this capacitor will shunt, or pass, the ac variations on the screen grid to ground while
maintaining a steady dc potential on the screen grid. In other words, Csg moves all of the undesired effects
mentioned in the previous paragraph.
