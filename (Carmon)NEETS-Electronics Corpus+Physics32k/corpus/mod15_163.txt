In a 36-speed data transmission system, the rotor of the synchro transmitter is geared to turn through 
36 revolutions for 1 revolution of its input. Units transmitting data at one speed are frequently called 1-
speed synchros; a unit transmitting data at 36-speed would be a 36-speed synchro, and so forth.
