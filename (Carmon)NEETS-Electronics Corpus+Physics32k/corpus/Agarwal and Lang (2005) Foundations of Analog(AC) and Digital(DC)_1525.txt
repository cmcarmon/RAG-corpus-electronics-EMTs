(cid:1) Capacitors behave like open circuits when a circuit containing capacitors
is driven by a DC voltage source. Conversely, a capacitor behaves like
an instantaneous short circuit when inputs make an abrupt transition (for
example, a step). (If the capacitor voltage were nonzero, then the capacitor
would behave like a voltage source for abrupt transitions.)
Inductors behave like short circuits when a circuit containing inductors is
driven by a DC current source. Conversely, an inductor behaves like an
instantaneous open circuit for inputs that make an abrupt transition (for
example, a step). (If the inductor current were nonzero, then it would
behave like a current source for abrupt transitions.)
