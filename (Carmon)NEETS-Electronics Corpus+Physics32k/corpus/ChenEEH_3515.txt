signal is the control signal of a switch. At every instant
of time, the switch is either open or closed depending
on the control signal: if it is positive, the switch is open,
whereas if it is negative, the switch is closed. Figure 1.2
shows an example of the control signal.
. Discrete-time or sampled data signals: A discrete-time
signal x is a mapping x: Z ! R , where the domain
is Z and the range is a subset of
line.
A discrete-time signal will be denoted as x[n], and not
x, again using the engineering convention of attach-
ing the time variable as argument. Note that
the
independent variable is integer-valued. Sampling a
continuous-time signal at equally spaced instants is
commonly used to produce a discrete-time signal.
The distance, T , in time between two adjacent sam-
pling instants is called the sampling interval, and its
inverse is called sampling frequency. Upon sampling,
x[n] Â¼ xc (nT ).
