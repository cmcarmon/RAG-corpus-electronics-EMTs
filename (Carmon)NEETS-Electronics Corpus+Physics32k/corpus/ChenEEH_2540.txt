Table 7.1 presents a list of closed-form design equations for
this type of hybrid, which are derived from transmission line
theory such as the even–odd mode decoupling technique. As
an example, it shows a speciﬁc selection of branch-line admit-
tances for the design of a 3-dB hybrid with various input-to-
output impedance transformations. Figure 7.18 gives a sche-
matic view of an N-section cascaded branch-line coupler with
N þ 1 branches. The aim of this arrangement is to enlarge the
10% limiting bandwidth of a single-section hybrid to more
than one octave.
