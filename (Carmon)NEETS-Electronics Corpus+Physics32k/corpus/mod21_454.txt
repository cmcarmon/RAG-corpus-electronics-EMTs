Intermodulation distortion occurs when two or more frequencies become mixed across a nonlinear
device. The resultants are the difference frequency and the sum frequency, both components of the
originals. Undesirable frequencies can be generated by a mixing of two discrete frequencies. Spurious
radiation, arising from close spacing of transmitter and receiver, is a prime source of an undesirable
frequency that can cause intermodulation distortion in an electronic circuit. This is particularly the case
when antenna couplers are employed. Cross modulation and parasitic generation (described in the next
section) are two other sources of undesirable frequencies that may cause intermodulation distortion.
