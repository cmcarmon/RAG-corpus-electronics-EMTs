Based on the 1-D structure, the basic BJT action can be
explained as
forward operation
(VB0E0 > 0 and VB0C0 < 0), electrons are injected from the
emitter across the BE SCR into the neutral base. The carriers
traverse the base by a combination of drift and diffusion, the
partition of which depends on the electric ﬁeld in the base, and
