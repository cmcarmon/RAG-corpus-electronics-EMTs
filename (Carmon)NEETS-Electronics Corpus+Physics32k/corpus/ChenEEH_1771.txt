Security
The security issue has been neglected in almost all discus-
sions of multimedia communication. With the increasing use
of online services and issues related to digital asset manage-
ment, however, it is now apparent that security issues are
quite signiﬁcant. Security provides
the following three
aspects to multimedia data: integrity (data cannot be changed
in mid-ﬂight), authenticity (data comes from the right
source), and encryption (data cannot be deciphered by any
third party). For example, public broadcasts require data in-
tegrity and data authenticity, while private communication
requires data encryption. All the above aspects can be provided
using different cryptographic techniques
like secret key
cryptography, public key cryptography, and hash functions
(Kessler, 2002).
