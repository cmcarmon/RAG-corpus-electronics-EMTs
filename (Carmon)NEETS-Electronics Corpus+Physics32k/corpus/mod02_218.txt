An example of a multisection electrolytic capacitor is illustrated in figure 3-18(B). The four lugs at the
end of the cylindrical aluminum container indicates that four electrolytic capacitors are enclosed in the can.
Each section of the capacitor is electrically independent of the other sections. It is possible for one section to
be defective while the other sections are still good. The can is the common negative connection to the four
capacitors. Separate terminals are provided for the positive plates of the capacitors. Each capacitor is
identified by an embossed mark adjacent to the lugs, as shown in figure 3-18(B). Note the identifying marks
used on the electrolytic capacitor are the half moon, the triangle, the square, and no embossed mark. By
looking at the bottom of the container and the identifying sheet pasted to the side of the container, you can
easily identify the value of each section.
