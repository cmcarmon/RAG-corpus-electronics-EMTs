The attenuation constant is a function of the microstrip
geometry, the electrical properties of the dielectric substrate
and the conductors, and frequency. There are two types of
losses in a microstrip line: a dielectric substrate loss and than
ohmic skin loss in the conductors. The losses can be expressed
as a loss per unit length along the microstrip line in terms of
the attenuation factor a. The power carried by a wave traveling
in the positive direction in a quasi-TEM mode is given by:
