frequencies of interest. Thus,
design speciﬁcation of RF
= 10 means that this criterion is easily met. Thus, the ﬁrst two choices for the
R
resistor and capacitor values (as well as many others in this range) will work well. Additional considerations
like parts cost might enter into the picture. Unless you have a high-power application (this isn’t one) or ask
for high-precision components, costs don’t depend heavily on component values as long as you stay close to
standard values. For resistors, having values r10d, easily obtained values of r are 1, 1.4, 3.3, 4.7, and 6.8,
and the decades span 0–8.
