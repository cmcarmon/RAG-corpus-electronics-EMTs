(cid:1) Memory and reversible energy storage are characteristics associated with
the state of the elements: charge in the case of the capacitor and flux
linkage in the case of the inductor. This behavior is quite different from the
behavior of ideal resistors. Ideal resistors do not exhibit memory, and they
irreversibly dissipate energy.
