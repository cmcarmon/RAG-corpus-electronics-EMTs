Air vehicles use a coordinate system of axes to help name important parameters used in the analysis of stability. All the axes run through the center of gravity (called the "CG"):
"X" or "x" axis runs from back to front along the body, called the Roll Axis.
"Y" or "y" axis runs left to right along the wing, called the Pitch Axis.
"Z" or "z" runs from top to bottom, called the Yaw Axis.
Two slightly different alignments of these axes are used depending on the situation: "body-fixed axes", and "stability axes".
