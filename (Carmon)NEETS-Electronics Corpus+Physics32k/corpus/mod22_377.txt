You learned in chapter 2 that a computer's primary storage area is divided into four areas, each 
serving a specific purpose. The input storage area accepts and holds input data to be processed. The 
working storage area holds intermediate processing results. The output storage area holds the final 
processing results. The program storage area holds the processing instructions (the program). You also 
learned that these separate areas do not have built-in physical boundaries, rather the boundaries are 
determined by the individual programs being used.
