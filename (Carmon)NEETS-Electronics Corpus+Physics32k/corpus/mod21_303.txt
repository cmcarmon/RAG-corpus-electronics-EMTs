Impedance measurements are often used during routine test procedures. Impedance-measuring 
equipment, such as impedance bridges, are mainly used in determining the capacitance and inductance of 
component parts. However, the values of combined circuit constants also may be obtained and used in 
direct calculations of impedance. An impedance measurement effectively totals the inductive and 
capacitive reactance together with the resistance in a circuit. In addition, impedance measurements are 
useful in testing and analyzing antenna and transmission line performance and for determining the figure 
of merit (Q) of electrical parts and resonant circuits.
