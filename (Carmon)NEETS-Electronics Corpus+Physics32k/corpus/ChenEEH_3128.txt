The locus of constant Ô¨Åeld current is also a circle whose center
is displaced on the negative Q axis by V 2=Xs and whose radius is
VEi=Xs. The region of safe operation of the rotor is inside this
second circle. This rotor limit circle intersects the stator limit
circle so that the operator must cut back power when moving to
more lagging power factor to protect the rotor.
