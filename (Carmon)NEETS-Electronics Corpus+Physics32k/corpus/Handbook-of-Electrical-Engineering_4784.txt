A  piezoelectric  component  often  has  a  very  simple  geometric  shape,  especially  when  it  is  prepared  for
measurement purposes. There will be mechanical resonances associated with the major dimensions of a sample
piece. The resonance spectrum will be more or less complicated, depending on the shape of a sample piece. If
the object has a simple shape, then some of the resonances will be well separated from each other and can be
associated with speciÔ¨Åc vibrations and dimensions (modes). Each of these resonances has an electrical equiv-
alent, and inspection of the equivalent circuit shows that there will be a resonance (minimum impedance) and
an antiresonance (maximum impedance). Thus an impedance plot can be used to determine the frequencies
and also the coupling constants and mechanical parameters for the various modes.
