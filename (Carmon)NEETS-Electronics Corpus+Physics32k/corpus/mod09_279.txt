The Armstrong oscillator is an example of how a class C amplifier can produce a sine-wave output 
that is not distorted. Although class C operation is nonlinear and many harmonic frequencies are 
generated, only one frequency receives enough gain to cause the circuit to oscillate. This is the frequency 
of the resonant tank circuit. Thus, high efficiency and an undistorted output signal can be obtained.
