To be a practical source of voltage, the potential difference must not be allowed to dissipate, but
must be maintained continuously. As one electron leaves the concentration of negative charge, another
must be immediately provided to take its place or the charge will eventually diminish to the point where
no further work can be accomplished. A VOLTAGE SOURCE, therefore, is a device which is capable of
supplying and maintaining voltage while some type of electrical apparatus is connected to its terminals.
The internal action of the source is such that electrons are continuously removed from one terminal,
keeping it positive, and simultaneously supplied to the second terminal which maintains a negative
charge.
