The SENSITIVITY or EFFICIENCY of a microphone is usually expressed in terms of the electrical 
power level which the microphone delivers to a matched-impedance load compared to the sound level 
being converted. The sensitivity is rated in dB and must be as high as possible. A high microphone output 
requires less gain in the amplifiers used with the microphone. This keeps the effects of thermal noise, 
amplifier hum, and noise pickup at a minimum.
