In every case, of course, you will have to consider what type of injury is present before you can 
decide on the best position. For example, a person with a chest wound may have so much trouble 
breathing that you will have to raise the head slightly. If the face is flushed rather than pale, or if you have 
any reason to suspect a head injury, do not raise the feet; instead, you should keep the head level with or 
slightly higher than the feet. If the person has broken bones, you will have to judge what position would 
be best both for the fractures and for shock. A fractured spine must be immobilized before the victim is 
moved at all, if further injuries are to be avoided. If you have any doubts about the correct position to use, 
have the victim lie flat on his/her back. THE BASIC POSITION FOR TREATING SHOCK IS ONE 
IN WHICH THE HEAD IS LOWER THAN THE FEET. Do the best you can under the particular 
circumstances to get the injured person into this position. In any case, never let a seriously injured person 
sit, stand, or walk around.
