A conductor carrying a current can be deflected 
(moved) by a magnetic field. It is not the conductor 
that is deflected, but the electrons traveling in the 
conductor. The electrons are restricted to the con-
ductor, so the conductor also moves. Electrons can 
travel through other media. In the case of television 
picture tubes, electrons travel through a vacuum to 
strike a phosphor screen where they emit light. The 
electrons are produced by an electron gun. By vary-
ing the electron beam over the surface of the picture 
screen, a picture can be created. To move the beam 
back and forth across the screen, two magnetic fields 
deflect the beam. One magnetic field moves the beam 
up and down the screen, and the other magnetic field 
moves the beam from side to side. This method is used 
in television, radar, oscilloscopes, computer terminals, 
and other applications where a picture is desired on a 
screen.
