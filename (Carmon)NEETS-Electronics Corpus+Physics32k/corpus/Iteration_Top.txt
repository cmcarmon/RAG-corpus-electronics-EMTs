Iteration is the act of repeating a process, to generate a (possibly unbounded) sequence of outcomes, with the aim of approaching a desired goal, target or result. Each repetition of the process is also called an "iteration", and the results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration.
In the context of mathematics or computer science, iteration (along with the related technique of recursion) is a standard building block of algorithms.
