The Gaussian gravitational constant (symbol k) is a fixed, empirical number which relates the period of an orbit to the total mass of the orbiting bodies and their distance apart, first proposed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his 1809 work Theoria Motus Corporum Coelestium in Sectionibus Conicis Solem Ambientum ("Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies Moving about the Sun in Conic Sections").
Gauss' constant was formerly used in celestial mechanics theory in preference to G, Newton's gravitational constant. It was officially a defining constant of Solar system mechanics from 1964 until 2012.
