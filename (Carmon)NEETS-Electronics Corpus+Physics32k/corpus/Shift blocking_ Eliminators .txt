Skip shift eliminators are produced for quick and simple DIY installation to circumvent the 'Computer-Aided Gear Selection' GM uses to implement the shift blocking feature. These are commercially available for about $20â€“40, or can be made with a little soldering for about $7. Notably, neither workaround will eliminate the "1-4 skip shift" dash light, which will continue to operate regardless. ECU tuning is required to eliminate the dash lights function.
