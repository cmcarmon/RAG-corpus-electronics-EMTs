excited dc motor. A simpliﬁed schematic diagram of such a system is shown in Figure E16.2.3(a),
in which the tachometer, error detector, and ampliﬁer are represented functionally rather than by
electric circuit connections. Assume the motor ﬁeld current is held constant, the load torque is
ignored, and the generator speed is held constant under all conditions of operation.
