where K is the gain term in the forward loop, G(s) represents the dynamics of the forward loop, or the plant,
and H(s) models the dynamics in the feedback loop. We note that in the case of continuous systems s is the
variable of the transfer function, and for discrete systems the variable is denoted by z.
