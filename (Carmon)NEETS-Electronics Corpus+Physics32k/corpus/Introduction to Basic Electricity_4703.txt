The program counter is a 16-bit register that 
contains the address of the instruction fetched from 
memory. While the instruction is being carried out, 
the program counter is incremented by one for the 
next instruction address. The program counter can 
only be incremented. However, the sequence of the 
instructions can be changed by the use of branch or 
jump instructions.
