their opposites and drift toward the junction. As the 
charges accumulate, the action increases. Some elec-
trons move across the junction and fill some of the 
holes near the junction in the P-type material. In the 
N-type material, the electrons become depleted near 
the junction. This region near the junction where the 
electrons and holes are depleted is called the deple-
tion region, which extends only a short distance on 
either side of the junction.
