Figure 4-38 is the schematic for a typical shunt-type regulator. Notice that the schematic is identical 
to the schematic shown in figure 4-37 except that voltages are shown to help you understand the functions 
of the various components. In the circuit shown, the voltage drop across the Zener diode (CR1) remains 
constant at 5.6 volts. This means that with a 20-volt input voltage, the voltage drop across R1 is 14.4 
volts. With a base-emitter voltage of 0.7 volt, the output voltage is equal to the sum of the voltages across 
CR1 and the voltage at the base-emitter junction of Q1. In this example, with an output voltage of 6.3 
volts and a 20-volt input voltage, the voltage drop across RS equals 13.7 volts. Study the schematic to 
understand fully how these voltages are developed. Pay close attention to the voltages shown.
