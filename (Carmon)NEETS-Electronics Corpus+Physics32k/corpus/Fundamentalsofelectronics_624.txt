If you examine the windowed signal sections in sequence to examine windowing’s eﬀect on signal amplitude,
we see that we have managed to amplitude-modulate the signal with the periodically repeated window
(Figure 5.16). To alleviate this problem, frames are overlapped (typically by half a frame duration). This
