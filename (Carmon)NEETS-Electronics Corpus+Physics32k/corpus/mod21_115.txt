When performing resistance measurements, your primary concerns are the RANGE AND DEGREE
OF ACCURACY of your test equipment. In most instances, an analog multimeter is accurate enough to
perform basic troubleshooting. When measuring extremely large resistances, you are sometimes required
to use a MEGGER or a DIFFERENTIAL VOLTMETER.
