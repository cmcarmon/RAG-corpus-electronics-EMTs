 is an abstract concept that may be represented in many ways. If we call the set of instantaneous
 of the network, then the knowledge of the instantaneous
values of all the branch currents and voltages as the 
values of all these variables determines this instantaneous state. Not all of these instantaneous values are required
in order to determine the instantaneous state, however, because some can be calculated from the others. A set
of data qualiﬁes to be called the
