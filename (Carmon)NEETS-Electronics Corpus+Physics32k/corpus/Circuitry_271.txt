0.025  S,  determine  the  change  in  drain  current  if 
the bias voltage increases to V2.5 V. 
 
Solution 
 
The change in gate-source voltage (RVgs) is V0.5 V 
and  the  resulting  change  in  drain  current  can  be 
determined from: 
 
RID = RVGS × gfs = 0.025 S × V0.5 V = V0.0125 A 
 
This RID = V12.5 mA  
 
The  new  value  of  drain  current  will  thus  be  
(50 mA V 12.5 mA) or 37.5 mA. 
 
The  mutual  characteristic  shown  in  Fig.  5.33 
illustrates  this  change  in  drain  current.  Note  how 
the drain current falls in response to the change in 
gate-source voltage.
