Some obvious terminology. The real part of the complex number z = a + jb, written as Re [z], equals
a. We consider the real part as a function that works by selecting that component of a complex number
not multiplied by j. The imaginary part of z, Im [z], equals b: that part of a complex number that is
multiplied by j. Again, both the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are real-valued.
The complex conjugate of z, written as zâˆ—, has the same real part as z but an imaginary part of the
