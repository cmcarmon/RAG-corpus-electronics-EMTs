A transmission line circuit which circumvented the above problem, producing an output pulse equal to the power supply voltage V, was invented in 1937 by British engineer Alan Blumlein and is widely used today in PFNs. In the Blumlein generator (animation, right), the load is connected in series between two equal length transmission lines, which are charged by a DC power supply at one end (note that the righthand line is charged through the impedance of the load). To trigger the pulse, a switch short-circuits the line at the power supply end, causing a negative voltage step to travel toward the load. Since the characteristic impedance Z0 of the line is made equal to half the load impedance RL, the voltage step is half reflected and half transmitted, resulting in two symmetrical opposite polarity voltage steps which propagate away from the load, creating between them a voltage drop of V/2 − (−V/2) = V across the load. The voltage steps reflect from the ends and return, ending the pulse. As in other charge line generators, the pulse duration is equal to 2D/c, where D is the length of the individual transmission lines. A second advantage of the Blumlein geometry is that the switching device can be grounded, rather than located in the high voltage side of the transmission line as in the typical charged line, which complicates the triggering electronics.
