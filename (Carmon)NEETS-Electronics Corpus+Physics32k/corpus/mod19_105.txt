The best position to use for the prevention or the treatment of shock is one which encourages the 
flow of blood to the brain. If the injured person can be placed on his/her back on a bed, a cot, or a 
stretcher, you can raise the lower end of the support about 12 inches so that the feet will be higher than 
the head. The circumstances of the accident may prevent the use of a bed, a cot, or a stretcher. In such 
cases, you might still be able to raise the feet and legs enough to help the blood flow to the brain. 
Sometimes you can take advantage of a natural slope of ground and place the casualty so that the head is 
lower than the feet.
