Figure 15.17  illustrates  the  time  correspondence  between  two  utterances, A  and B,  represented  as  feature-
vector sequences of unequal length. The time warping function consists of a sequence of points F = c1, . . ., cK
in the plane spanned by A and B, where ck = (ik,jk ). The local distance between the feature vectors ai and bj on
the warping path at point c = (i, j) is given as
