As with the Westminster Hansard, the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding "repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent ("The member for Halifax West", etc.) or by their cabinet post. Hansard supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—"Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP)" or "Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.
If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as "Some hon. members: Oh, oh!" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:

The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): The House has heard the terms of the motion. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
Some hon. members: Agreed.Some hon. members: No.The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.Some hon. members: Yea.The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): All those opposed will please say nay.Some hon. members: Nay.The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): In my opinion the nays have it.And more than five members having risen:The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): Call in the members.And the bells having rung:The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marcel Proulx): A recorded division on the motion stands deferred until tomorrow at the end of government orders.
